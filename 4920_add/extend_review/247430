This is not a spin-off or as some say ""just a remake of Hitman 1"". This is a sequel, this is Hitman 3. It comes after Hitman 2. This is not a remake. Only a few missions are remade from Codename 47, and they are so different that it doesn't matter. The rest of the missions in Hitman: Contracts are original and deserve to be played.Possibly the darkest and grittiest of the Hitman series. The story follows Agent 47 as he is discovered and shot right after an assignment. Seriously wounded, he staggers into a building and is treated by an old man. The whole game is a series of flashbacks of missions he has had in the past: some never played before, and some we have. Each mission follows a cutscene of 47's present condition. The police finally locate him and surround the building. The end finale is an homage to the finale in Léon: The Professional, and it is incredible.Some of my favorite missions in the entire Hitman franchise are right here in this game. The Bjarkhov Bomb, The Meat King's Party, Rendezvous in Rotterdam, Beldingford Manor, and Hunter and Hunted are all great missions and they can only be found in this game.To say that this game is weak or nothing more than a remake of Codename 47 is absurd. I'm here to tell you that this is very much a worthy sequel and a great game that you would be thankful to play."

The missions are HUGE and challenging, particularly on Professional difficulty.  It's a worthy entry in the franchise, despite the fact it ""re-imagines"" some of the original ""Hitman: Codename 47"" levels.  I highly recommend this one.IMPORTANT NOTE:There's a problem when it's first installed that people have noted on the forum where the game will not save, however.  This problem does happen, but it's easily fixed.  Just go into the ""Hitman Contracts"" folder after it's installed and create a new empty folder called ""Save""   For whatever reason, the Steam installer will not create it automatically, and you'll be very sad when your unlocked weapons and progress go away when you exit the game."

Hitman 2 was an epic story that kind of spanned all over the world. This one, although there are different locations, it's not one big epic story. It's a lot of darker, psychological small stories mixed together, so the score follows the darker aspect of Hitman and his career.""Due to a licensing issue, Contracts wasn’t available through steam until last year (whilst all others were released) but it’s nice to now be able to add this to my collection.Finally, I get to see the Meat King once more!

I picked up Contracts on Steam during the summersale for a ridiculously cheap price and decided to revisit the game. It felt nostalgic to play it again, especially the first 3 missions.The PC version suffers from a lot of problems on modern computers. If I stood inside a building, close to an exit I could see the snow coming through the house. When you go into steam overlay and back to the game again you get two mouse cursors which is a bit annoying. Hitman looks very outdated BUT there's HD mods online and probably other useful things you should look up before playing the game. However, if you are like me and want to experience the game just as it was before (without mods) you will run into some wierd glitches and graphical problems. It is a problem possible to overlook though.Contracts have 12 missons. The maps are huge and on every mission theres a bunch of disguises, weapons and methods you can try out. It's like a sandbox where you run around and try out different things. After every mission you get a rank based on how well you did. I like that you can choose to shot everyone or be a silent assasin. Sometimes the movement is a bit clunky. For example there is no cover system and no good way of sneaking around doors, which can screw you over a few times. Other then that the controls for PC is okay.If you can look past the graphical problems, if you're running the game on an old machine or if you have found a good HD mod for it, then I wouldn't hesitate. Especially if you are a fan of the other Hitman games or you're just curious to see how to golden age of stealth games looked like. This is a true classic."

I enjoy all of the games in this wonderful series, but there is something special about this game in particular. I cannot put my finger on whether or not it is due simply to the spectacular level design, or due to the fact that it does not hold the players hand, among many other possible reasons. Perhaps it is a mix of all these great aspects that makes Contracts rise above the other games in the series.This game may not be the most technically polished, it doesn't look the greatest, or have the absolute greatest controls, but it has an undeniable charm that the other games lack. If you play Blood Money, you will notice that the graphics and character models etc are all much, much nicer and more realistic looking, but I find this to be a much, much better game. The missions in this game are exceptionally interesting, each with a unique location, always multiple, unique ways to complete your objectives as well. The levels are large, and interesting with many paths to take. For a game from 2004, the action is fantastic. Lot's of blood splatter when taking out enemies and it feels fun as hell doing so. Nothing more fun than popping an enemy in the back of the head with a silenced pistol and dragging his corpse into the shadows. It's an exhilarating feeling playing this game and I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys videogames, period.Summary:Pros- Great level design- Decent graphics for the time, especially on pc, maxed out at 60 + fps.- Good ragdoll physics for the time. (It's no Half Life 2, and the ragdoll is a little much, but it's fun.)- Multiple ways to complete your missions, ensuring replayability- Good story- Doesn't hold your hand.Cons- Graphics are a little dated if you have high standards- Could have used some more unlockable stuff- The A.I can be a little unbelievable at times"

,Recommended,247430,18941982,"Posted: 7 November, 2015",all,Dr. Mircow,"You can assassinate your target with a pillow by suffocation. ‘Nuff said. *drops microphone*Hitman: Contracts is the third instalment in the stealth-based franchise which consists of a couple of reimagined missions mainly from the first game and a bunch of original ones. Unlike the other Hitman games in the series, it has a much darker and grittier tone as shown by the constant rain, night time assignments and a greater emphasis on brutality.The story in Hitman: Contracts revolves around a wounded Agent 47 who eventually collapses out of shock in his apartment and begins having hallucinatory flashbacks from his earlier missions. These flashbacks act as a way to fill in the gaps in the story after the first game’s, Hitman: Codename 47, aftermath. As a result, it may lack a cohesive narrative from start to finish since some of those flashbacks are jumbled around in time (some are even chronologically in reverse order), ultimately making Hitman: Contracts one of the weakest narratives in the series. But on the other hand, it is to be reminded that Hitman was never lauded for any complex story, or the lack of, so to speak.  By the end of the game, and to no one’s surprise, Agent 47 recovers from his wounds and sets up the scene for the events in Hitman: Blood Money.Gameplay-wise, it plays exactly just like the previous games – patrol, analyse your environment, sneak in, change outfits, set up your traps, hide corpses, assassinate your targets and escape – but with much tighter and more refined mechanics. For instance, the game’s ability to switch to first-person was visibly improved as 47’s movements feel more natural. Whilst this feature tends to be used (almost) exclusively for taking down your enemies with your weapon of choice, its improvements are welcomed in this game as killing enemies in this perspective has never been more fun than this, and frankly, it even plays rather well. However, Hitman: Contracts is the type of game where playing it on the hardest difficulty is a requirement as otherwise it would not be a true Hitman experience. The lower difficulties are (subjectively) far too easy and forgiving. Not only that, but the simple fact that the game allows you to go all gun blazing, if you are willing to, drastically diminishes the concept of being a “hitman”. Bluntly killing someone wide open is almost like failing the mission in my eyes. Thankfully, playing it on Professional difficulty reduces the chances of turning on spazy Rambo mode.The level design in this game is definitely one of its strongest aspects. The maps are fairly sandbox-y and varied with plenty of routes and secret paths to discover. Despite a smaller number of maps (only 12 maps) than in Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, it can easily be forgiven as it features some of the best and most memorable levels from the Hitman franchise: “The Meat King’s Party”, “Beldingford Manor” and “Traditions of a Trade” to name a few.Aesthetically, Hitman: Contracts almost has its own sort of personality. As mentioned earlier, it noticeably feels a lot darker and even more atmospherically depressing than other Hitman games. Although visually it is without a shadow of a doubt a vast improvement over the previous two games, frankly even in gameplay, the graphics do show their age in places as more than a decade has passed since its original release. Whilst it looks better than other games from 2004, it surely was not amid the best looking from its period. A small observation: one thing which I personally liked in Hitman: Contracts is the way splattered blood appears on top of darker surfaces with its mirrory effect; a sign of how much gruesome this game can get.A Hitman game cannot be a Hitman without Jesper Kyd as composer, and this time around he succeeded once again in creating yet another thrilling, memorable and easily recognisable soundtrack for this game. There is a reason why Hitman fans regard him as the one true composer suitable for this franchise.Hitman: Contracts is not without its flaws, one being the aforementioned weak narrative. But the game’s biggest flaw though, and the most recurring one, is the enemy AI. The best way to describe it is by calling it schizophrenic. It has its fair share of well scripted moments that immerse you in the experience, but sadly there are far too many encounters when enemies do implausible things which overshadow these moments. Accidently bumping into someone would totally ruin your cover as they immediately assume you are the hitman, as if the person would not have recognised you by now just simply standing a few feet away from you – at least realistically. For some unknown reason, all enemies also seem to be strangely telepathic at times, managing to unrealistically communicate with their mates from all away across the map. I like how they can work in groups when they are alerted or looking for you, but sometimes they can be utterly stupid. Another thing which it is never explained throughout the entire game is how enemies know that a bald guy must have killed the person lying on the floor when no one was even near the scene of the crime when it was committed. Things like these, whether small or big, can easily ruin the immersion and increase your frustration.Lastly, the option of selecting your equipment during a briefing screen before each mission was removed in this game and I believe this was a huge mistake by the developers as it eliminates the sense of a tactical preparation beforehand.In conclusion, Hitman: Contracts is far from the perfect Hitman game as it is only a mere, yet effective, refinement of the formula established by the earlier games. But thanks to its own distinct dark tone backed up by some great level designs, an atmospheric soundtrack and tighter mechanics, it is a worthy entry and easily amongst the most satisfying experiences this franchise can offer. Too bad that its AI - one of the most crucial aspects for this type of game - can let it down at times. If you are looking for complete realism in your playthrough or a compelling story that sucks you in, Hitman: Contracts is perhaps not the one which can consistently deliver. It does, however, provide enough hours of fun with solid gameplay finding exciting ways to assassinate your targets at your own pace in its grim atmospshere. So if that is enough incentive for you, then Hitman: Contracts is a great starting point to get into this stealth series if the earlier games look too clunky and rough around the edges."

A lot of the game Audio is missing, gun sounds and sound effects still seem to be present within the game however music, ambient sounds and so on appear to be removed due to the licencing issue, i have however been told that this will soon be rectified with the only copyright offending song will be replaced like in the Hitman Trilogy HD Remake. (This has now happend)Hitman Contracts is one of the black sheep’s of the series, taking place within the wounded mind of Agent 47 after he is wounded. The game remakes classic contracts from the past games with updated graphics, better AI (In comparison to Hitman 1 and 2)Personally i hope this Audio issue is resolved soon as not been able to listen to the games fairly good sound track is a downer and i would say hold back on purchase until it is back.If you are however new to the Hitman series and you are looking for a Hitman game to sink into, i suggest skipping Contracts and Jumping onto Blood Money, then go back down the line. Currently im going to reserve judgment of the Steam version of the game due to the Audio, however if i judge the game based on what i played years ago i would definitely give it a 8/10 as contracts as one of my all-time greatest missions.

The story of the game picks up immediately after the ending of codename 47 and the majority of the story are flash backs of Agent 47's missions in the past. These flash backs include some revamped missions from codename 47. So if you ever wanted to play missions from code name 47 with updated controls, AI and graphics, this game should satisfy you. Hitman Contracts has a much better AI system then Hitman 2. I found myself able to run in this game and not be shot at randomly. Note that the AI could act unfair sometimes but not as often as Hitman 2. Also the sneak/crouch is much improved. I feel that Hitman contracts has some of the best missions in the franchise. Two missions that I consider that have the most replay value in the franchise is the Meat kings part and Hunter and the Hunted. If you were to pick up any Hitman game I would recommend Contracts or Blood money. Both games have strengths and weaknesses over another. I give Hitman Contacts a 9/10.

On that score nothing has really changed drastically since the last game but I felt like the mechanics have been tightened up a little more. Think of the series as a fruit ripening to perfection. Hitman: Codename 47 was the green bud and every game since has been another step towards the harvest-worthy banana, Blood Money. (And maybe Absolution is the banana becoming just a tad over-ripe.)Speaking of Blood Money, the events of this game take place in between two missions from that game. All but the last mission of this game are told as flashbacks, thus giving the developers a framework to be remaking old missions in. The story opens with 47 stumbling into a motel after having been shot. We later see the events leading up to this incident in Blood Money. It all dovetails nicely.Also, the Chinese voice acting for the triad members in this game is shockingly good.

After getting wounded from one of his assignments and collapsing in his apartment room, 47 begins to have flashbacks on previous assasinations he has done. The first mission is what happened directly after the events of Codename 47 and has you escaping from Dr Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer's Asylum, where other patients and clones of 47 are located.While the story isn't something to write home about and even felt a bit underwhelming, it still has a few well made cutscenes and even has a nice twist at the end.Hitman: Contracts is definatly the darkest Hitman to date, the mentioned well made cutscenes are very grim and the introduction and first level are very disturbing.Many of the game's levels are based on levels from the first Hitman game: Codename 47 although have been improved and tweaked heavily to create a fresh new experience as well as less frustration. Aside from the first level, every level has atleast one target to kill using a varity of tools and strategies, sometimes you'll have secondary objectives such as finding blackmail photos or something similar. Once you've completed all the necessary objectives, it's time to get out of there using an exit.The game's stealth controls are well done, such as the stealth kills and sneaking. However the shooting mechanics are a bit underwealming and definatly makes the run-and-gun approach more boring and harder due to the awkward shooting controls, I dare say Hitman 2 had better shooting. Speaking of shooting, there are a varity of guns at your desposal, such as SPAS 12 shotguns, AK74s, MP5s and so on, each well detailed and has a nice reload animation.When you kill somebody or happen to find a disguise in a level, you can wear the disguise and blend in as the enemy, being able to go inside restricted areas and carry rifles in case things get messy. However if you move too close to NPC you're disguised as, there is a small chance they will realize you don't belong there and will begin opening fire. Think of it as like Absolution's disguise system except without a blending mechanic. However the disguise system isn't perfect, I still felt restricted in exploring many environments with the right disguise with the large chance of being spotted easily and made the game needlessly more difficult.Speaking of difficulty, many times I was spotted, I never knew why even with a disguise on, I didn't know if I was actually in a restricted area, was doing something wrong, carrying the wrong weapon, which made me extremely frustrated and again made it needlessly difficult.After completing the game's 12 levels, you can go back and try and earn the ""Silent Assassin"" rank, which will net you a new weapon for each level completed with the rank, which definatly increases the replayability if you want a lot out of the game.Graphically, the game for 2004 was very detailed and was overall beatiful and by today's standards, they definatly look dated but still looked very nice in many areas such as the animations. There are a varity of locations ranging from Manors, Russian snow areas, a Chinese city, Paris and so on and so fourth.Sound wise it's great, most of the guns sound great, the voice acting is well done, and environment sounds are fantastic. Of course I have to mention the music composed by Jesper Kyd, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥does he do a great job at the music. The music is very dark and fitting for Contracts as again it's the darkest game in the series, playing lots of foreboating music pieces and creepy tunes and possibly has one of my favourite main themes.Overall, Hitman: Contracts is a worthy entry in the Hitman Franchise, the game is very difficult, but also rewarding especially if you manage to get the highest stealth rank; Silent Assassin. If you haven't played Hitman: Contracts before or haven't played it in a very long time, I definatly reccommend picking it up.Hitman: Contracts is a dark, disturbing game, and that's why I love it.8/10"

When I saw this on sale for 99p, it was a must buy.Apparently the levels in this game are a bunch of remakes of the missions from the first hitman game. (Hitman: Codename 47) Having never played that game though, I can't say how much they compare. Some fans of the series might see this as a cheap way of cashing in on a ""new game"", therefore being disapointed with Contracts. With this being my first Hitman game back in the day though, I was drawn in.One of the first things you'll notice is the games dark, tense atmosphere, created through an excellent use of visuals and soundtrack. The lighting and shadow effects help to create a real intensity. Adding to that is the moody soundtrack which is right up there with one of the best featured in a game. (Credit to Jesper Kyd)The gameplay/controls also feel really solid and familiar with the previous release. (Hitman 2: Silent Assasin) So if you've played that, the learning curve is easy to pick up quickly.Sneaking around can be tricky but feels much more satisfying than just running and gunning. It's definitely recomended to play this game through stealth. The results are more rewarding and the game plays out much better if you choose this route. However, choosing the less subtle ""mass murderer"" kind of playthrough has a certain satisfying edge that you won't find playing more cautiously.What makes the player coming back for more however is its lasting appeal and replayability. The ability to perform levels in different ways (stealth, action, multiple ways to assasinate targets etc.) is what makes this so.Overall, a must buy for all Hitman fans. Plays and feels much like Hitman 2 but improves through its unique style and presentation. There are less levels in this game compared to its predecessor however, which may disapoint some fans.The style of the game doesn't seem to have aged with time either. Only obvious difference being the games 2004 generation graphics. (which is forgivable)Gameplay: 8Graphics: 8Sound: 9.5Value: 9"

It tweaks and refines everything about it's predecessor, making it the best playing game of the trilogy and has some of the most memorable missions in the series, including excellent remakes of standout hits from the original game, Codename 47, which most people haven't played. It's also notable for having a much darker and more sinister tone than previously seen in Hitman.I highly recommend Contracts and consider it to be one of my favorite entires in the whole series."

(no spoilers though)The game has a relatively short span, as I have 5 hours exactly at the time of this review, because the levels are pretty easy once you get the hang of it, but don't let that turn you off, it's still a very fun game true to the Hitman formula.This game earns an 8/10 from me, not optimized 100% perfectly, as well as annoying bugs, but it's still Hitman, you will enjoy every minute of it, maybe even go down memory lane with many of the missions, as usual several very creative ways to eliminate targets.

Once you start to get the hang of it and manage to complete your objectives with style, it gives you an incredible feeling of satisfaction. There are many ways to complete each mission, and no assassination is like another. Therefore, you can replay each level many times to find new ways to assassinate your target.If you're here for story, this is not the game for you. There is pretty much none of it here, and all the levels are in reality just 47's flashbacks.

But, at the end, the choice is yours.  Maps and missions are very diverse and there are several ways to achieve your goals for each mission.

This game is the climax of the Hitman series as a whole. 6 of the missions were remade from codename 47, but they are vastly greater in almost every regard. This is the perfect mix between silent assassin and blood money. Silent assassin is just like this game, however, a whole lot buggier. Blood money was too easy and casual to be considered the best hitman game. I could go on about how this is the best installment in the series, so in short...Buy this game!"

Some missions could easily function as horror short storys, and I wouldnt mind if they returned to this atmosphere with HITMAN.Just like in the first Hitman where its amplified by the maniac tutorial guy, 47's epicness is smoothly emphasized from the start of the game. The first level makes you feel like the best Hitman in the world born to take out targets by no-scope,  and it immediatly sucks you in. Unlike Blood Money who's intro is simply corny in comparison, or Hitman 2 where you start off powerless and have to watch thatpriest get kidnappedwhile you cant do anything, after which follows a tutorial and a super corny 'welcome back 47' type of intro. Not in Contracts. Contracts isnt corny.The variety in the levels is great, the levels are really fleshed out, lots of replayability. For its time, the graphics are still holding their weight. The voice acting is still on a B quality level, but this time they embraced it and made it style. And honestly, thats about the only scar this game wears, and it wears it with pride.In my opinion, this is the most characteristic of the Hitman series up untill HITMAN."

While it does not feature the custimaztion and notoriety system of Blood Money the games overall tone is the best of any Hitman game bar none. As you'd it imagine it's standard fair with a very open ended approach to completing objectives but what makes this game the best in the series is the atmosphere. To start things off you must flee a blood spattered insane asylum swarming with SWAT and unstable mental paitients, then it's off to BDSM party in a meat packing plant to locate a missing girl and murder her captors. The tone remains consistent throughout, you feel like you're taking out the scum of the Earth in this one more than any other Hitman thus far.

76561198067587169,Recommended,247430,20601683,"Posted: 18 January, 2016",all,Illusive Man,I remember when i first played this game about 10 years ago and i hired it from a video store for my Xbox i put it in and waited for it to load up i was then hit by the scene of Agent 47 sitting in that chair in the dark with lightning lighting up the room with his W2000 Sniper and this incredibly badass electronic theme music playing that this game was going to be awesome.This game is truly fantastic Hitman Contracts always holds a special place for me being the game that introduced me to the series and to me it holds up very well against both its predecessor and its successor. The biggest thing to note with Hitman Contracts is the very different tone that this game brings from other games in the series it comes across as alot darker and really gets into the sinister side of the criminal underworld and the life of a Hitman like Agent 47.In my opinion the greatest thing about Contracts is the amazing atmosphere this game achieves the setting is very gritty and in many ways the game comes across as almost moody but in a really good way because it allows you to immerse yourself in its storyline and keeps you on edge as you work your way through the game personally this kind of gaming experience is one of my favourites and this game does a fantastic job of doing this from start to finish.The game achieves this by using some pretty basic things like flashbacks setting the missions at night and with lots of rain to give of a very dark atmosphere combine this with the once again outstanding soundtrack by composer Jesper Kyd gives you a winning formula from the start the soundtrack is quite different from the Orchestrals of Hitman 2 and instead comes at you with a very dark style of Electronic music that keeps you on your edge of your seat full of suspense as you go about the game with many tracks be darn right aerie and others being incredibly thrilling and excting.In terms of gameplay it feels very similar to Hitman 2 but i am pleased to say that the AI isnt nearly as twitchy and hard to anticipate as in Hitman 2 which makes the gameplay smoother and makes more sense. While this game does not have as many missions as in Hitman 2 it does an incredible job of providing you with a massive amount of non linear style gameplay through the various missions alot of the maps are very large and you have so many ways to go about performing your hits and it can take a very long time trying to work out the best methods. So although the game isnt as long as Hitman 2 you still have plenty of replayability and things to explore in this game this game also has some of the most memorable missions in the Hitman series.To sum up for this game i consider it to be everybit as good as Silent Assassin was which is impressive in itself given how its quite often hard to follow up a good game with a sequel that is as equally good the only real weakness i can say is that i wish it had as many missions as Hitman 2 but the missions it does have are fantastic and that really isnt a fatal flaw i just wanted to play more for longer. All in all my score for this game is the same as Hitman 2 a solid 7.5/10 and highly recommend it for the price a superb game indeed.

It used to be my least favorite Hitman game, but now that I really got into it, it's probably my favorite.The game is pretty much all flashbacks to 47's missions in the past, there are some new ones, but about half of them are great remakes of Codename 47's missions.Pro's:+ Great, dark atmosphere+ Amazing soundtrack, it doesn't have many tracks though, you will hear some in multiple levels+ Great stealth game+ Awesome Codename 47 mission remakes+ Challenging.

,Recommended,247430,24671113,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,"Hitman: ContractsPositives:+ Hitman: Contracts provides players with a large number of assassination options. Dress as a chef and deliver a meal, then when you are out of sight hack your target to death with the meat cleaver you were carrying. Sabotage a fireplace in a mansion with gasoline to burn your target to death. Perhaps serving poisoned whiskey as the butler is your fancy? Disable metal detectors in a hotel security room to sneak your weapons past. There's lots of possibilities.+ Like Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, the game has a good atmosphere and attention to detail. There are also some new missions to partake in, but some are repeated from previous titles (more on that in the con section). I loved ""Murder at Beldingford Manor"" - a giant palace home to beautiful courtyards, where you need to kill the owner. A big, open map with lots of entry points - a hedge maze trap door, front entrance and more. There's a few others that stand out, like ""The Bjarkhov Bomb"", where 47 must assassinate two Russian targets and detonate explosives on a nuclear submarine to sink it.+ Enjoyable stealth and action combat make for an exciting experience.Mixed:~ Only about 8 hours of gameplay, slightly more of higher difficulties - but there is some replayability present which helps.Negatives:- The plotline is pretty much non-existent. Agent 47 has been shot by an unknown assassin in Paris and travels back to his apartment, delirious. He begins to drift in and out of consciousness, reminiscing about past assassinations which you will replay. In terms of new ""story"" content there is none. At the end of the game you'll get to control the fate of agent 47, but that's it.- About half of the missions are re-makes from the first game in the series, Hitman: Codename 47. So for those who have finished that game, you're really offered 4-5 fresh assassination tasks which is a bit lacking.- The freedom of choice for weapon loadout prior to assassinations is missing in Hitman: Contracts. You'll be given the standard ballers, silenced pistol, fiber wire and anaesthetic but that's it. Any other guns you want - you'll need to find throughout the level, and you can't collect them for use in the future either.Overall Score: 7/10Hitman: Contracts is a great game, but it loses points for blatant repetition of missions that already exist in the series. With a weak plot but nice gameplay a seven seems deserving. Be sure to grab it on sale."

Plus, some levels feel unpolished and lack of minor details.Although, there's no big step from Silent Assassin. Contracts is still simply fun, solid. and deep in stealth mechanic."

The game opens up with 47 entering a motel set in France. After an assignment gone wrong, he's been wounded and is moments away from being hunted down by a squadron of a French S.W.A.T. team lead by a police official whom 47 was trying to assassinate. As 47 tries to recover from his wounds, he starts to remember his missions from his past including missions when he was first enlisted into the ICA. Once more the graphics are improved a notch and the controls are also given an upgrade making this game more playable than the first two games as there aren't as many flaws as present as I was used to seeing in the previous installments. The FMV sequences are very well animated, you know the development now has the software to create a great game. As in the second game, the weapons obtain in each level are usable once you have beaten the game. Only guns are collectable in the game and not melee weapons like in the last game. There are more weapons to choose from as well as certain weapons only obtainable when achieving a ""Silent Assassin"" reward. Making this game highly replayable, you can't go wrong with this almost perfect sequal to everyone's favorite bald anti-hero."

However, if you've played Silent Assassin, you'll find nothing but improvement. Disguises actually work to the degree you'd expect them to, and you get to re-live some of the old Codename 47 levels with the vastly improved mechanics!You unlock weapons by bringing them with you at the end of the level, and also completing levels with a Silent Assassin rating. After completing the game you can then use a level select to choose which level you want to play, and what you bring with you in it.However, if you want your ""Highest Ranking"" on the level select menu to change, you have to complete that level again AND the rest of the story so that it will create another Level Select ""save"" after the credits.

Its gray-ish dark, creepy, eerie, even bloody at times. Adult themed missions like human-hunting, psychopath kidnapping people, and more. The level designs are dark, mostly set at night, and always raining/bad weather. Jesper Kyd also did a great job composing the music to be as tense as possible. Probably the reason why i didnt finish this game when i was a kid. Love it or Hate it i suppose.The gameplay is pretty much still the same as Hitman Silent Assassin, only improved a bit. You sneak faster and the gameplay just feel more fast paced, though still requires a careful planning. A decent sequel the the Hitman 2.The missions consists of dark eerie themed levels, also some ""revisited"" levels from Hitman Codename 47 which is quite fun and nostalgic. Though it can be rather uncreative because you already know how to play the mission if you have been following the series.My only complaint is that this game is incredibly short. I managed to complete this game in about 3-4 Hours achiving the Professional/SA ratings on Expert diff.TLDR: Fun game, decent sequel, atmospheric as hell, love it or hate it kind of thing."

But behold, Contracts finally made its way onto steam and right into my library the instant I heard of it's arrival. and OH MY GAWD is it amazing.In my opinion atleast, everything in this game just...works. The shooting, the sneaking, the missions, just everything seems to work. This game does share a bunch of positive similarities from Silent Assassin as you gain weapons for completeing missions on Silent Assassin rather than a lousy score bonus or an achievement. Also...the soundtrack in this is probably the best in any Hitman game. It's dark, and completely fits the whole tone that Hitman gives to players.LASTLY: I do see that most of the missions in this game are just redone from Agent 47...but they're redone so well to a point where those levels are completely remastered and looks like completely seperate levels compared to those in agent 47. (That, and you can actually have the benefits that this Hitman gives you that were not avaliable back in the first game IE saves >u>)All in all, get this game. Hitman fan or newbie, get it.

The traditional hitman structure is a positive quality but the flaws tend to stick out.The A.I is borderline broken. At times the A.I. doesn't notice things that it should and at other times, it notices things that it shouldn't. I'll let this pass since this is an old title.Aside from that setback, the story doesn't add much to the game's value. The story is...well...Horrid. I shouldn't explain myself for this one. You should find out yourself.Lastly, the biggest issue I have is how short the game is. I could beat this within an hour or less.Overall, I STILL think this is a good game. It doesn't greatly deviate from the Hitman structure which gives it playability.

This also translates to game being easier, which is a plus for me as sometimes you want to have fun.Techincal problems are widescreen support. Yeah, I had the option for FullHD but when it's with aspect ratio 4:3, then I might think this game is about a fat bald midget. Luckily there is some kind of solution, though it's not the best.Music is better than the second game, but doesn't match the first game. Though There is a difference. They improved the sound system. So now if you are in a firefight then a action music plays which really adds to the athmosphere. I can't put my finger on it, but music has some kind of weird eeriness to it.

The game plays like many hitman games, where stealth is encourraged over the run and gun aprroach. HOWEVER, on normal difficulty this game just doesn't care. You can complete an entire level with a simple tactics found in many third person shooters and only get scolded when the game calls you a 'mass muderer' which confuses me as this is the 3rd game in the franchise to which 47 kind of is a repeat offender when it comes to first degree pre-determined homicide BUT WHO AM I TO JUDGE?! I want to hate this game for some levels where it's unclear of where you're meant to go, however this just adds to the replayabillity of the game.

As the enigmatic Hitman, you must use stealth and tactical problem solving to enter, execute and exit your assignment with minimum attention and maximum effectivenessIt puts you in the role of Agent 47, a shadowy assassin who is equally capable of slipping in and out of target locations un-noticed, the game provides a wealth of memorable situations you will talk about years down the road.However, the game is not without its flaws. For a game nearly 10+ years old, gameplay mechanics can be somewhat clunky. Probably the biggest gripe however is the in-game saving option, which does not exist. If you are spotted in the middle of a mission or die, you will need to start the mission over. While not a big issue in the earlier missions, this can become extremely frustrating on the later missions where you need to navigate a huge mansion with tons of guards and one mis-step means you're killed and need to restartHowever, Hitman: Contracts is a brilliant stealth game for its generationRECOMMENDED :)"

,Recommended,247430,29777848,Posted: 8 February,all,jesusrey91,"Hitman: Contracts is a remake of sorts of the first installment in the Hitman series, Codename 47.This game made infinitely better the entire gameplay of the first and second installments, which sometimes missed proper instructions and/or had large empty maps.With each mission given in this game, you are entirely free to choose your approach, either the Silent Assassin way which sometimes is hard but extremely gratifying, or the Rambo way entering the place guns blazing. The options are all scatered across the map, you only have to find the proper way to approach every situation. The freedom is still there. Do you want to snipe someone? There you go, take the sniper at the start. Want to take the Silent Assassin approach? Get close to your target by making him believe you're someone else. The challenges are there too. This is the first Hitman game to be done the right way. Sandbox style!Obviously the graphics are outdated nowadays, but this game definitely has aged well, as it is as fun as it was when it first came out. After passing the entire game and all of its missions, sometimes I come back to play some Assassinations just to relax. That's how good this game is!Anyway, just a heads up for all of you, if you're gonna play Blood Money too, the final mission in Contracts is tied to a mission of Blood Money, which makes the story more interesting!Talking about the story, while some missions come back from the first game, there are a couple of Assassination Contracts which are entirely new to this game.Anyway, final verdict 9/10, only because I played Blood Money and, hell... that's a 10/10.Buy it, play it and don't regret it!"

76561198094494140,Recommended,247430,28347356,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,lapsenvahti,"Hitman: Contracts is probably my least played (doesn't mean least favorite) Hitman game for few key reasons, that we'll jump in that later.Mechanicly, it's pretty much a mix of Hitman2 and Blood Money. Enemy AI is still pretty paranoid, but nerfed a lot from the lunacy, that we had in the predecessor. Rating system is more rational than h2 (distraction shots are viable strategy again!). It has actually very few new things, and overall it feels like a little more polished map pack for Hitman2.Biggest negative with Hitman: Contracts imo is that it is way too short. And out of those few levels we have, roughly half are rehashed from the first game. Overall the game feels like the developers were either too lazy or too busy to finish it. There's nothing really broken or anything like that, there's just not enough content compared to any other title of the series. Another thing I dislike about this game is that the atmosphere is way too dead. I've heard people saying that this is the most atmospheric game in the series because of the raining and gritty environment, but I have to disagree with the majority here. I get that it's the darkest game in the series and there's fewer high-profile targets and it's supposed to show the more sinister side of 47's business, which it really accomplishes, but it's not about that. The environment felt way too mute and colourless and it seemed very uninteresting compared to the exotic locations of h2. Sound design was also very flat/unbalanced and even killing felt very unsatisfying, because of the weaker feeling weapons and nerfed physics engine. In a nutshell I'd say that this is techinically the least well-made Hitman game for it's time, I mean seriously, it looks and sounds worse than Hitman2, and thats a lot.And as for the missions, half of them are f*cking amazing. Remade Rotterdam levels seem like totally new and they're much more entertaining than the ones in C47. Beldingford's Manor is one of the most perfect missions in the series with some great level design, and it also nails the moody atmosphere that the developers obviously were seeking for with the other missions too. Meat King's Party wasn't that great of a mission in terms of gameplay, but the setting and some twisted details in the location made it crazy fun. Remade TotT was kind unnecessary, since the original is already perfect and the changes are so minor here, but it was nice to play anyway.My biggest regret about this game is that they had to remake the whole Hong Kong section from the first game, and you can really tell, that that's the point when the developers ran out of time. Excluding Seafood Massacre (which is actually one of my favorite levels in this game), HK remakes are the least interesting missions in the series. The changes to the original levels are very minor, they are buggy as hell, and their soundtrack annoys the s*it out of me. Slaying A Dragon was very gimmicky version of a simple and fun level. Wang Fou Incident (or smth like that) bored me to death, and I completed it with a weird glitch on my first and only playthrough. Original Lee Hong Assassination used to be my favorite level ever, this one I blasted my way through; it was that boring. Also Bjarkhov Bomb, which is an original level here, doesn't really belong to my favorites since it feels kinda half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Afterall I'd still recommed Hitman: Contracts even just for the few good missions and 'cause it's so dirt cheap. For me it's kind of a ""snack"" between H2 and Blood Money, u know the ""major titles"". It aint a bad game despite all the negative things I said in this review; it starts and ends with SWAT-team kicking doors and there's some good thriller between that'll entertain for at least 10h or so. And as I said, it mixes some of the best features from h2 and BM, so it's gameplay-wise the most balanced game in the series in terms of difficulty, yet it doesn't have those horses*it accident kills (just my opinion :P). And if you're already a fan, you defintely should pick it up."

,Recommended,247430,28616517,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,Starcaptain10,"Fun, well designed, and dated. Time was not kind to this one.Enemy AI is basic, but mostly functional. They work on a distance/speed based detection system. If you run they can detect you faster, and if you get near them or, worst of all, bump them they'll leave a gooey wetspot where you stood.The main issue i have with it is that you can't always tell if your in an area that you arent allowed to be in, until guards start swarming your position with machine guns.Shooting is suprisingly well done. You really feel the impact your bullets have on their unsuspecting cranium, and it's only aided by the basic physics system that sends bodies flying when you shoot them. I highly recommend pulling duel pistols and spraying the level to the ground.Level design is great as usual for this series, but unlike the levels in other games, they seem to like to stay in one setting a lot. You revisit the streets of hong kong a few too many times for my liking.The other problem with a few of them is that they are way too big. Theres one level thats about a mile across, with objectives sprinkled in between. It will take most people about 20-30 minutes to finish just because they had to run from end to end, and if they mess up or run into someone in between, mission restart. Slightly alieviated by a save system on lower difficulties but good luck on anything higher.Despite the wonky AI and the overly long levels, this is probably my 2nd favorite in the series, bested only by Blood Money. If you're willing to put up with early 2000s budget stealth mechanics, this is a must buy.PS: If you play blood money before this one you will regret it. This one will feel incredibly dated in comparison and it may detract from your experience."

Most of the missions are remakes from Codename 47's as that game has aged to ♥♥♥♥. The game takes place after 47 is injured after the 'Curtains Down' mission in Blood Money and he has flashbacks which are the game's levels.

,Recommended,247430,35232153,Posted: 26 September,all,Shiifty ツ,"As a avid hitman player I though to put a few words together and write my own review of this game. This was the 2nd Hitman game I had the pleasure to play, and have most likely soaked hundreds of hours into it (before I bought it on steam a while back). Its probably the darkest of all Hitman games, with the constant use of rain and night in every level helps to set the dark and sinister mood.Gameplay and movement is solid with none of the clunky movement that codename 47 had. Its easily comparable to Hitman 2 : silent assassin on a gameplay and movement level, as many things such as the suspicion meter and the more detailed map and key system are both in place. The interface and inventory are also very similar, but with the whole interface receiving a facelift graphic wise.Speaking of the graphics, they aged very well for a 12 year old game, with full 1080p support and virtually no lag (as to be expected for how old the game is). The textures might ward some people off as their Blurriness gives off some console quality vibes, but graphic wise the interface and weapon models still hold up today, even if they are blurry as hell.The gameplay is quite addicting and enjoyable, as I saw myself repeat the same level or part several times trying to get that glorious “silent assassin” rating in all missions (which I failed at miserably) , which was a breeze thanks to the implementation of saves (brought over from Hitman 2) which really change up the dynamic of the game, which results in less back tracking upon death or failure. The inclusion of remastered levels from codename 47 is also a welcome feature which works well with the story of the game (no spoilers) and helps to give fresh players an inside into some of the older missions from the series. The flow of the older levels with the mechanics of contracts work well, and I would argue that it plays better than the first game. The length of the game is around 20 / 30 hours depending on the approach you take, if you’re the run in guns blazing type the game will fly as it includes a mere 12 missions, so its recommended to take your time with the game. There also a wide variety of ways to execute you targets, giving each playthrough a fresh and new feel, even if it’s the same levels that you’re playing again and again. Options such as smothering a target with a pillow or poisoning a person drink are only a few of the creative ways you can kill people.Overall contracts if by far my favourite hitman game due to the sheer amount of time I spent playing it, and I would greatly recommend new players to experience the original 3 games."
