At first you smirk at all the little references and sarcastic jokes and puns, but then after hours of shifting through menus you frown because that is really all the game has to it.   It is unfortunately a one trick pony, and ironically it essentially is the shallow facebook game that this game precisely intends to mock.  As an example of art imitates life, it works and I get it.  As a game that is an enjoyable time sink?  Not for $20.  It is a phone ap game at best for less than five.Update 1-19-15It ain't worth 9.99 either.  This is a glorified cell phone app."

For those that like the idea of a social management game, there are java based phone games, android games and I'm sure IOS games that have more to offer in the free to $10 range, but on the PC, Positech's Kudos and this are it without counting the Sims, which is really a whole different experience.It is a social life management game. You are given so many tme units a day to allocate your time and try to manage the life of your character, try to inch up the job ladder and anything beyond that is fed as backstory clues but the game itself is of a style more befitting a tablet than a PC interface.As far as the style of game goes, it is pretty average in it's genre, and have seen cell-phone games that had more to offer. For those that like the genre of game (which I do, in some of my moods) it's worth getting, but unless you love the game style, not at $20. $5 to $10 would be a much more typical pricetag for what is being offered. If you don't already know and like the genre, there are much better games out there to experiment with the genre, starting with the game this one almost clones: Kudos 2, which you can usually pick up for $5."
76561198016207066,Not Recommended,247870,13018617,"Posted: 20 November, 2014",all,MR. RAGE,"I bought this back when it first came out because I thought the premise was intriguing. I've always been a fan of Star Trek, and I thought a game about how those poor, unfortunate redshirts and other nameless, unimportant crew members survived the insane situations that inevitably befell the crew would be neat. I thought a game about being an underapprciated but vital part of a team would be fun.This game is not that game.Let's go through each of the claims this game makes any why I think most, if not all of them, are bogus.1: ""Satirical, tongue-in-cheek social simulation, filled with humour and political intrigue."" If by ""political intrigue"" you mean ""boring, petty interpersonal drama that I get enough of in my daily life,"" then yes. This game has political intrigue coming out of its nostrils. I will say that it is at least mildly satirical, as the implication that social media is a poor substitute for actual interaction is a perfectly valid one. I will admit, though, that I didn't find too much about this game to be funny.2: ""Detailed character creation: choose from 5 different species, from human to tentacled squid creature!"" It isn't that detailed, I'm afraid. Additionally, it actually makes very little difference what species or even sexual orientation that you choose, except in very rare circumstances (such as being depressed because you don't have a significant other and everyone you can date is not interested in people of your gender, and the one person who is hates your guts; I don't need a repeat of my everyday life, thank you).3: ""Each game is unique: Megalodon-9 is full of procedurally generated AI-driven characters, each with their own random personalities and profile pictures."" Each game is unique, but the NPCs aren't sure the names and species and personalities might change, but they're all the same, vapid, uninteresting characters.4: ""Customise station settings: define the kinds of personalities you'll encounter, from friendly chatterboxes to self-obsessed bigots."" This bit is accurate, at least.5: ""Update your Spacebook, strategically 'like' statuses, and send private messages to your fellow station citizens."" This is also an accurate feature.6: ""Arrange Spacebook 'events' with your friends, frenemies, and even higher-ranking officers, to influence your relationships and skills."" Despite being accurate, I'm not sure how this and the prior item are even features.7: ""Multiple routes to success through turn-based gameplay, from skills-based diligence, to romance, to charismatic schmoozing."" This is accurate, to a degree. You cannot rely on just one to succeed, however; the best route always involves using everything at your disposal. And you'll need to: without romance, for example, your morale may drop .And if you're in a bad mood, your work will suffer. If your work suffers, say good-bye to that promotion. And before you know it, you're another soulless drone lamenting your lack of a love-life and your boring, dead-end job, anxiously awaiting the weekend so you can go to wine-tastings to get your mood back up for the coming week, only to repeat the cycle ad infinitum.8: ""Navigate an extensive, non-linear career tree, by gaining the right skills... or just by making the right friends.Make friends and manage romantic relationships -- if you can handle the drama!"" On a personal note, this is something I dislike about this game, especially when paired with the above item. Don't get me wrong, I love playing games where I get to be a manipulative schemer. But when the best run I ever had involved buddying up to my supervisors and discarding them when I'd gotten a promotion, that may say something about how viable a skill-based playthrough is.9: ""Strategically manage your interests and skills."" See the aforementioned bit about wine-tastings.10: ""Buy items in the Self-Help Object Purveyor (S.H.O.P.) to increase your stats and skills, from RoboCats to illegal hoverbikes!"" True, and also a requirement.11: ""Away missions!"" Also known as ""which one of my friends is going to die miserably and send me into a self-destructive spiral?""12: ""Humorous parody of social networking culture."" A parody, perhaps. But I wouldn't say it's a particularly humorous one. I found most of the jokes to fall flat.13: ""Puns! So many puns."" Yes, but they're not particularly funny puns.Now that that's done with, here's my final conclusion. Redshirt was fun, for about 10 minutes. Then it became very, very tedious and very, very boring. And while that's fine to a degree, especially if your game is parodying something as boring as social media, the game itself has to be fun. Quite simply? Redshirt is not fun. I cannot suggest that anyone buy this game for anything more than $3.00.Seriously, wait for it to go on sale if you have to buy it."

This game feels like a job and it's not fun.  Just as an example, as you progress you are supposed to gain Spacebook friends in order to extend your influence.  However, there is only so many action items in a day, and you can't do activities with everyone, so you constantly are bombarded by all of the people that you aren't spending time with.

I can play it in bursts. But your ""Spacebook friends"" in this game are SO NEEDY.

It's exhausting for a game.And, real talk here--- it feels like one of those flash games you play on like newgrounds or kongregate or whatever for free.It was a phenomenal concept.

Judging the Captain for not seeing how very in love they are with their Science Officer and vise versa. What I got was repeative clicking, and boredom. I can't be bothered with the inane lives of real people, why did I think I would enjoy this?I understand that that's the point, the commentary the game is making on FB and Twit etc. but a whole game on it? Where actions have no conquences, nothing changes, and a very real sense of same sht different day. I use video games to get away from that.I was expecting more actions away from Spacebook, and that was my own fault, it had been on my wishlist so long that I turned it into the game I wanted not the game it was. I wanted to experience life on a space ship for the cannon fodder, all I got was life on Facebook.I got the game on sale and would recommend doing so too if you are going to go for it.

I'm a big fan of the life sim genre and I own most of Positech's games. When I heard they had a new one out that looked like a satirical version of Kudos, I ignored all the bad reviews and jumped at the chance to buy it. What a mistake. This game is basically Kudos 2 with a space skin. But though it's lifted most of its gameplay mechanics from Kudos 2, it's a huge step backward. The interface is clunky and hard to manage (and for a game that is ALL interface that's a crying shame), the gameplay is a lot less fun, it's riddled with bugs, and the 'humour' is repetitive and gets wearing after just an hour of gameplay. And though it's been, what, six years since Kudos 2 was released, nothing has been improved - the gameplay is meandering with no meaningful objectives, there's no feeling of real characters to connect to, and there is endless, endless grinding. I am usually very patient with indie life sims, and will put up with bad writing, poor artwork and lots of grinding, but there has to be SOMETHING at the heart of it. But this life sim is absolutely lifeless. It's an amateur piece of garbage that's worth $5 at best. Do yourself a favour and pick up Positech's Democracy 3 instead - or if you're desperate for a life sim, try something by Hanako Games, or go to Abandonia and download Princess Maker 2."

All the player has to do is just a little bit of research, to discover this game is made by the British company (Positech) that makes the very successful games ""Democracy"" and very  importantly, ""Kudos (original, and Kudos Rockstar and Kudos 2). ALL of these other games are ""casual simulation spreadsheet"" games that playout different scenarios.THIS game is basically ""Kudos DeepSpace 9"".  The developer however, wanted to take its spreadsheet games in a new way that hadn't been parody'd much in video games ""yet"", why not re-work their spreadsheet interface mechanics of their life-casual-sim Kudos, with an interface that is based on facebook?What IF, instead of facebook being a place where you talked about what was going on... what if it was the true reality?  Where parties, life-events, relationships, and so forth, originated on facebook, and then  played out in life?  THIS is Redshirt, or as it is accurately called ""Spacebook"" the game.Its a fun twist on the Kudo's game style, set in a very star-trek themed universe, ran from a spacebook interface.  I highly recommend it.  I will see what kind of replay value it has, but for now, I can say, it has been a fun casual play, enjoyable, and creative.I think the developers should make a demo, but until they do, I suggest you download one of the Kudo's demos... and then just immagine the interface re-worked into a facebook style of menu-systems, with a clever set of space-themed events and opportunities."

My gaming tastes include the following that synch up with this game, so if you have these same interests, you might like this game:1. Turn based games.This game basically moves when you make a decision to do something, so you aren't in a race with a virtual clock.2. Life Simulations.Conceptually, I like seeing and playing games where the heart of the game is trying to simulate a cultural universe. I've designed them as a hobby, and I also enjoy playing them and seeing other's work.3. Novel concepts.This is 90% a Facebook simulator. When I was reading the negative reviews, I noted that the ones I read disliked that concept. It's different, for sure.The strategy of the game is in choosing what to Like, who to schedule events with, what general things to say - with the idea that there's no right answer. Just like in any group of people, you're not going to make 100% of them happy 100% of the time.But bottom line is that if the idea of a Facebook simulator is dull for you, this game is not for you. If the idea intrigues you as a game concept - absolutely give this a try. Especially if you like Sci-Fi."

Move over ""The Sims,"" because this game gets it right.  This is how the real, modern world works so pay attention!Careers: No one cares about your skills, you education, or your talents.  No one is going to read your resumé or give two farts about what you studied in college.  All your potential bosses are ever going to do is immediately look you up on Facebook and look at your profile.  Do you share thier hobbies?  Their political views?  Dress the way they approve of?  Most importantly, do you know someone that they do?  Because these are things that decide if you get hired, fired, promoted or passed over.Just like in real life.Relationships: Are you handsome?  Beautiful?  Rich?  Smart?  Athletic?  No one gives a crap.  Your Facebook page is your relationship application form.  How many friends do you have?  Do you follow the latest trends?  Do you watch the right shows, listen to the right music, misquote the right famous people?  Do you effect an air of false depth by shamelessly cutting & pasting mopey song lyrics without any semblence of context?  Ohmygosh, you are, like, socool, then!  Relationship request accepted.Just like in real life.Finance: In the future no one will ever truly own anything ever again.  The future is all subscription based, where ""ownership"" simply means that you'll be paying weekly and monthly upkeep fees on stuff until the sun burns out and the Universe freezes over.  Well guess what, kids?  The Future is Now!  Watch as every week your pitiful paycheck is immediately consumed just trying to keep the garbage that you bought four months ago from breaking down for another few days!  Get sucked into the competetive ego drive that is created by your lame, shallow friends constantly braggging abouttheirpersonal treasure troves.  Piddle away your financial future on a pointless treadmill just to keep up with everyone else in a vain quest for popularity.Just like in real life.Life: In the end whether you succede or fail, prosper or rot in misery, literally live or die all boils down to your dedication to sacrifice all your personal goals & aspirations upon the blood soaked altar of ephemeral on-line popularity.  Your own thoughts, opinions, ideals and very personality shall all be slowly morphed over time to match that of those that you need to suck up to and impress in order to get ahead.Just like in real life.Summary: If ever there was a game that perfectly, unabashedly and honestly summed up this shallow, sick, cruel, twisted world we live in today... it is Redshirt.  No other game is so forthright about telling it like it is.  It's not what you know, it's who you know.  It's not what you think, it's what your boss thinks.  Relationships are just lateral career maneuvers.  Friends are just rungs on a ladder, aquired when above you and discarded once below.

This game, however, is not (and is, as far as I can tell, not related to the book).The premise of organizing everything in your life via a social network sounds one-sided - and it turns out it is. The game gets boring and tedious rather quickly:- I reality not all of your friends are available all the time, and that can be implemented in the game, but beyond a certain level, it is purely annyoing.- Of the many actions one can take, most seem redundant and choices are arbitrary.- Relationships don't seem to mean anything, and there does not seem to be much in the way of building your character.- The user interface is ugly and (for me) confusing. Seems that not all actions are availabe from different tabs, and sometimes links lead to the wrong action.

Everything is literally done through a FB-type of menu where your character interacts with other NPCs through wall posts, Likes, PMs, and events. Sometimes a random away-mission will break-up the monotony, but this happens rarely and doesn't really add anything to the overall experience, unless your significant other gets killed, at which point you can just find another. There are parts of the game which are addicting such as climbing up the Career ladder. This is done through cultivating relationships with the right people or through upgrading skills and interests which are required for the job you want. Mostly, however, the only appeal seems to be geared towards achievement hunters as nothing accomplished in the game feels meaningful in any way otherwise. If text-based SIMS seems to be something you might be interested in, then this game is for you.Value: Picked this game up when it was on sale for 50% off, for which I am thankful, because even at $10 I cannot recommend this game. At best this is a $5 game which will last you, depending on how bored you are, anywhere from 30 minutes (if you're bored quickly) to several hours (actual completion). There doesn't seem to be a lot of replay value.

Each ending seems to be based on a slight variation in focus, but the game will be essentially the same each time, so it's impossible to work up the motivation to play again after the end credits roll.The game has a lot of great ideas, but the shallow implementation holds it back. It's too obviously gamey, with obvious player-controlled victory, to have the pointlessness make a bigger statement about disempowerment. But the game itself is shallow enough that you'll have it all figured out early on, and spend most of the actual gameplay performing boring, predictable actions to move counters and progress timers.

Friends are then used to advance the players career, resulting in higher pay and the ability to level up more easily through supplementary items.

Deep down, the game is a life or dating sim. You hook up with friends by inviting them to activities they'll like. You drop them as soon as they stop being useful, in favour of more profitable marks. What starts as a cute juggle between half a dozen friends balloons into 30+ names you can barely remember, and all of them clamouring for your attention. (Yes, that's supposed to be the point, I think.)Horrifically obvious is the grinding near the end. You'll rush to climb the ladder so fast, then realize you've got a month left of doing whatever it is you're doing. I gave up and tossed in the 'I WIN' card out of frustration. The graphics are mediocre, at best, and while by itself I'd overlook it, when you see the lack of change during the end sequence, you'll wonder why you spent all this time doing this.For a one-man job, and at half off at $10, it's good. But it desperately needs more polishing before I can recommend it to anyone for playing."

You only get so many actions unless you use in-game credits to buy more, and everything moves very quickly. Planning is important -- read your options before doing anything, but expect messages to pop up that spoil your plans as you necessarily respond to them.Pros:Very immersive and addicting. There are lots of little jokes and genre-based humor. If you enjoy making fun of the structure of social media as we know it, you'll enjoy the nuances of Spacebook in much the same way any gamer can enjoy the tongue-in-cheek of games like DLC Quest. It's challenging no matter what level you're at within the game, so you can't fall into complacency and get bored with it. You have to work hard to keep progressing. Making a list of the meal specials each day can be entertaining, too.Cons:Very immersive and addicting. Over an hour of my time vanished unexpectedly when I first started up the game. Not as bad as the Skyrim Disease, but can definitely take up a whole evening when you least expect it. The only other con I care to mention is that you can't always do precisely the reaction or response you would prefer when things happen or things are said. You are limited to the way Spacebook is designed and what your aspiration goals are in the game (they change every time you reach one). This can make the game slightly tedious.Replayable:Absolutely! You can make different profiles for yourself and play as different people with different interests. Change the game settings for each player profile to get different responses from other redshirts or frequency of away missions and medical visits. It's highly customizable that way (or increased randomization, depending on what you choose)."

It does have its quirks and going on away missions (which are simulated) and seeing half the people die is somewhat humorous at times. The problem with the game is it is extremely repetitive and becomes fairly dull after you get several hours into it. Sure you're still trying to move up the job rankings and maybe trying to woo someone else due to your last hook-up being vaporized during an away mission but the fresh feel wears off after a while and isn't renewed.It's worth a snag if you can get it on sale but I wouldn't pay full price for it.
