,Recommended,247910,9325673,"Posted: 2 March, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army 2 might have one of the dumbest titles I've seen so far, but it's an excellent, but short, co-op game. It's fun if you have a team of 4 dedicated people that you can trust. I have to see that most of the people that play this game at least try to stay connected. I remember the first game being awful, just because halfway through a game you'd practically always be alone. People left whenever things didn't go their way. This game is, so far, different and as I said it's one of the things that make it (more) fun.The graphics are moody and the levels have a good atmosphere. They absolutely fit this game.The gameplay is the same as the previous game. You just shoot as many zombies as you can, usually with a sniper rifle. And once in a while a special zombie will appear that requires a bit of (team) effort to take down.Finishing the game shouldn't take too long; there are only 5 levels to complete. Granted, they're pretty big and should take about 30-45 minutes to finish, usually going from point A to B to C while fighting off hordes of zombies. All you need is a good team. I'm sorry to say that once I finished all of these levels the desire to finish them again was non-existent. Which is unfortunate, because a co-op game should be all about playing with people. I guess it's because the levels are always the same and the zombies always spawn in the same places. So once you've seen it, you've seen it all. That's not a good thing for a game that's all about multiplayer.That doesn't take away the fact that it's still a very, very enjoyable game. Just don't expect to play it for days and days.[Rating: 77/100]"

It's boring now, cliche, and generic 'horror' material. A solid go-to concept that game developpers, movie directors, and halloween costume fanatics go to in an effort to get the desired effect of creepy spooky scary, with minimal need for customization and story writing.""Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2, pretty much takes every preconception of Zombie themed horror games, and puts a bullet in its head with the carved words ""Suck my tallywacker"" put in the side.""I don't care that I'm generic. I don't care that I'm cliche. I don't care that I'm 'just another zombie flick', and I most certainly don't care that my storyline is on-par with World War Z! I'm a zombie game, where you snipe zombies, and magic is the cause. Don't like it? Go F yourself!""That being said, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 manages to do something few titles have managed to do before. Take something cliche, and make it fun.GameplayHave you played Sniper Elite of ANY kind before? If yes, then you'll find nothing new here. Gameplay has gotten zero changes from the father-title Sniper Elite V2.For those who havn't:The gameplay takes place in a linear third person shooter type style, with predetermined 'jump out and get you' moments where entire flocks of zombies appear from around a corner. There are two moments in the game: There is traveling, where you're moving from point A to point B, with a few handfuls of Zombies to shoot here and there, nothing too stressful. The other is siege, where you hunker down in one spot, and put down trip wire explosives, land mines, dynamite etc., while sitting in your perch and trying to kill every zombie before they overwhelm your position. Between those are safe houses, where you can refill everything, and where you'll get a free checkpoint.""THIS SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE LEFT 4 DEAD WTEGELKJBGKLAWBGKI""Yeah, it does, doesn't it? That's cause it pretty much is L4D, except that it is in 3rd person, and only two kinds of zombies can run.GraphicsSlightly outdated, but that's due to its engine being a few years old now, but it is definitely good enough for medium range rigs and up. I can attest to the fact that a computer more than 4 years old will not run this title above 5 FPS unless it was a top end rig in its hayday.SoundI can best explain this by drawing a paralel to the once popular, now garbage TV show 'Lost'. You all remember how amazingly good that show was, but then the creators just started dragging it out, adding more and more bullcrap to it, until they tried to end it on a good note, and failed MISSERABLY!?!? That's pretty much what the sound is for me in this game. It's the one major draw-back in my book;The sounds in the start of the game are pretty good. Really spooky scary, demonic whispers from Satan's world where you hear Hitler repeat sentences like ""WE ARE ALL LOST!"" and women crying for mercy etc. That's all pretty damned cool, and it really did a splendid job at setting the mood........Until you play through like 4+ levels, and realize that the music soundtracks...Ambient sounds...Hitlers little frantic demonic time looped yelling? Is all the same, unchanged. By the 6th level I was literally able to to IMMEDIATELY mimic Hitlers words cause they were on a time loop that I eventually learned by heart cause I started to count the time between them(It's 7 minutes and 30 seconds by the way).The music though, is good, if a little uncharacteristic, but it's good music to shoot nazi zombie brains to mush with, so I'm not complaining too much in that regard.Conclusion:Walk into this game expecting a linear, poorly narrated story that pretty much says 'unholy relic turns dead into zombies and only the relic holder controls them, assuming all parts of the relic are together....Which Hitler didn't quite realize until it was too late.' and you should be fine. I'd say its worth it, and to add a boost to the fun, the game permits many different difficulty varieties...The lowest to get a feel for the genre's controls and getting used to the playthrough etc. all the way up to Sniper Elite difficulty with a multiplier that goes up to as many as 4 times as many zombies as there normally would be(By the way, that means that for every 1 zombie in the normal game setting, there would be 4 extra ones in the highest multiplier)Naturally, the 1x(Standard) multiplier, plus the regular difficulty settings, are intended for single player playthroughs, whereas the multipliers are for the hardcore games where you cooperate with 3 other players. Yes, there's multiplayer by the way!I'd say, if you're into Zombie Games, and you have a group of like minded friends who want a shooter where you shoot magical satanic nazi zombies? Then this game is pretty much specifically created to suit your needs. If you're one of those 'ZOMBIE GAMES ARE DUMB, THIS IS DUMB, MAGIC IS DUMB, SATAN IS DUMB, I WANT Call of Duty BACK' people, then I suggest trying Hello Kitty Online instead...Yeah, I went there, deal with it."
,Recommended,247910,10159661,"Posted: 18 May, 2014",all,Vash(88),"This game feels more like an expansion than a sequel; however, like its predecessor, it is only a $15 game that goes on sale regularly.The combat is almost identical to the first.  The biggest issue that I've noticed is that it wants to be a co-op ""shooter"" over a co-op ""sniper.""  There are far less areas for sniping and many more tight corridors and small rooms.  There is an addition of stationary turrets in some parts of the game.  While we all love a good stationary turret with unlimited ammo to blast zombies with, the machine guns can take from the experience that the first Nazi Zombie Army was going for.A few new enemies were implemented to help mix up the game-play.  None of them are ground breaking or innovative, but they do add to the game.It all comes down to how much you enjoyed the first game.  SE:NZ2 is a fun, but it is not an epic title.  I personally found the achievements fun to hunt with a group of friends.One other thing to take into consideration before getting this game is the lack of players.  The match making, like the first game, is dreadful.  If there are any public players on, you'll be lucky to find a team anyways.  Be sure to have a group of friends to play with if you are looking for a good co-op experience.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=200404875"

The plot of the game goes ahead, but just like in the first chapter that's more like a pretext to make you face Nazi zombies together with your friends. This is the kind of game you just play and have fun because you play with friends and it doesn't need any particular story, nor complicated mechanics, just go and shoot or snipe on the hordes, that's all, really. Why the fun? Friends of mine just love wave based coop games... Or zombie games. I can live with it but I've been simply struck by the 80's synth music and that foggy atmosphere that really reminds me of Carpenter's movies. That's my weak point: 80s. Believe me or not that made the difference to me with other common games: the opportunity to play with friends against nazi zombies in foggy villages with an 80's synth music.I could spend a couple of words about the awesomeness of the slowmotion effect during successful sniping shots and the x-ray cam to see which bone has been broken by our bullet, but that's not the news, something already seen and already done, in Sniper Elite v2 or in Mortal Kombat as well.The most important thing I can say is that this is the second chapter, which comes after the first chapter (of course) and there's also a trilogy chapter, which holds the first, second and third exclusive episode in an improved engine (not much, just a little bit).So while I recommend this game, I actually recommend you to buy directly the trilogy because this situation doesn't make much sense at all...+++PROs+++ZOMBIES... NAZIS! COOP!!!Facing Hordes of Nazi Zombies with your friends? You've just nailed it, without anything too complicated.ATMOSPHERE.Foggy roads and villages, rubbles in towns everything while you listen to some 80's synth music. Simply perfect!---CONs---MANEUVERABILITY.A common problem with Sniper elite 1 and V2, the caracter's moves can be a bit too rigid sometimes, and it may cost you your life while you're surrounded by zombies.MEANINGLESS EPISODIC PRODUCT.For some odd *cough*MONEY*cough* reason they released the first and the second chapter on their own. Then they released a trilogy with both of them and the final chapter. No discounts for those who already owned the first 2 chapters, no single third chapter as well... None of the two chapter is worth buying, it makes more sense to take the entire trilogy.I played this game on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64"

Just buy the trilogy.Otherwise, very fun co-op linear shooter with at least one other friend; otherwise it's just okay...but much more difficult. and at the same time, odd, given the cutscenes always show 4 characters, even if there's just 1-3.

The story was never a major strength of the last one and this one seems only slightly better in that respect. There are a couple new enemy types and that's about it. If you liked the first one, you'll still like this one. It's a decent coop experience, but not much more.Here's a link to my review of the first one. I'd have to say it applies to this one just as well.http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/227100"
,Recommended,247910,22228382,"Posted: 3 April, 2016",all,Foxysen,"Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a direct sequel to NZA which was a spinoff of Sniper Elite V2. So direct that it's pretty much same gameplay but on different levels. Came out at the end of 2013, after Rebellion suddenly found out that NZA was a hit. Shoot more zombies from the third person view shooter!Multiplayer community is kinda there. Most likely you will find no games when you launch coop, which would start your own lobby. And then, only a few minutes later it will fill in fully. So yea, wacky like that.And eh, what can I say. It's not much compared to the first one. Setting got changed to be more of hellish-otherwordly thing of yellow color. It has a bit more of spooky moments, while not spamming demonic things as much as the first game.Shame about music though. It seemed to be more down the earth, not as much of synth rave personallity here.Not many additions to the game. There are turrets that are pretty good, unless you are doing solo. And yey, new sub-bosses, one looking like a demon from the thumbnail of NZA1.It's a bit less polished in a sense that I sometimes would see zombie getting stuck in geometry. Heck, on the 5th level after killing all zombies during siege I decided that something glitched and I got stuck only to find out after the second replay that there were sniper zombies in faraway towers, who spawned yet were looking at different direction, thus not noticing me and thus not giving themselves away with attacks.It's still not nicely paced for a single player either. There are actually few sieges that are literal hell to do in solo, since they are nothing more then almost straight line of space so you can't run around elites. You have to just outdamage them first. Because of it difficulty jumps around in solo play, very uneven.On other hand, coop is certanly better. There are more of interesting situations. There are no sieges that are way too dragged out. And there are less of filler moments with just normal zombies.But meh, it's more of same thing, just with a bit more elements and different levels. Probably better than NZA1. But it's more of a part of a bundle.P.S. P.S. It has different balance from ZAT. In ZAT kicks are much stronger, non-rifles are weaker, skeletons die from one kick. Turrets are weaker too."

They're also slow so you should be able to easily headshot them, aside from the running suicide bomber.There are skeletons too, but their method of death is shot through the heart in the chest and not the head....You can solo this game, but unless you enjoy being a loner - you won't have much fun doing this by yourself...The game has partial SLi(on default SLi doesn not work) and Optimus support. For SLi, just go to thispostto find how to enable it(not sure about CrossFire as I don't use AMD cards, or maybe CrossFire works out of the box for this game?) and for Optimus, go to your Nvidia Control panel-> Manage 3D settings -> Program settings, have Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 (nza2.exe) selected, and change to *High-performance NVIDIA processor when it says ""2. Select the preferred graphics processor for this program which is usually on default ""Use global setting (Auto-select: Integrated)"" for me. For laptops with AMD GPUs well, I don't know(maybe it already works on default?) as I don't have one so go google it or something for its equivalent changes..... :PPlaying this game on maximum graphical settings, including 4x SSAA on, will net you around 20 to 40 fps, but with SLi 770s @ 1920x1080, I was able to keep it at an almost consistent 60fps at the most part6 - I have a 144Hz monitor so naturally I would either need to turn it off or at most have it set to 2.25x so it sits around 120 to 150, sometimes lower to around 50 in some places even with SSAA off. But a single 980M, just won't cut it for 4x SSAA(and this is only at 1920x1080, think about trying to run this in 3840x2160, or lesser yet still somewhat popular resolution of 2560x1440!) in this game...hahaha, perhaps two in SLi would work....but mine only comes with one.... :P Plus laptops with SLi are like $4k+ - might as well build a stronger desktop/tower with its equivalent budget.Music and sound has the right tone so it gives us players the immersion we're after, therefore it's well done. I think this game supports surround sound, but not sure(or can't remember) I'll need to test it out some more to find that out. If it does, that's another plus for this game, especially for a zombie horror survival game like this!Yeah overal, I like the game so it's a thumbs up from me!=====================================Played on ""The Beast""i7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, Win7 x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fansPlayed on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB and 1TB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display"

,Recommended,247910,26175029,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Review for Sniper Elite - Nazi Zombie Army:Here.It's obvious now that from the beginning, Rebellion had planned to make the Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army spin-off series a trilogy. This second installment came just mere months after the first, and as such it doesn't offer up much that the first game didn't already have, save for new landscape visuals and a couple new demonic creatures. For a larger grasp of the core of the game, I'll direct you to my review of the first Nazi Zombie Army here.Somehow this title manages to come bearing more blood and gore than its predecessor, not to mention a new fiery landscape that wasn't present previously. All of the maps have at least one area that's completely on fire, while others convey the sense of burning in surrounding areas due to thick plumes of smoke highlighted by an orange-yellow backdrop. There's also a bigger horror element to this second entry, one that is equal parts psychological, disturbing, and grisly. The amount of blood-drenched bodies, pentagrams, swastikas, gore spurts, spatters, and smears have increased dramatically, it's definitely not a game for the weak of stomach.New enemies include a Fire Demon, who bursts with uncontrollable rage and sets any surrounding grunts on fire; turning them into speedy little bags of ignited charcoal. The other new ""big"" enemy is the Summoner, and you can pretty well understand his role by his name. Also included are a new skeleton model with a little bit of added armor, and remodeled grunt soldiers. The rest of the foes are ones that return from the prior title; snipers, gun-toting warriors, occultists, and regular skeletons. The story is also still split up into 5 chapters, all of which last about half an hour to an hour each. There's not a whole lot that's been added, as you can clearly tell.All of the same gameplay elements that were present in the original title are still included here, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 also comes with all of the annoying little quirks of its sophomore adventure as well; leaving it blatantly obvious that this game was either finished, or nearly so, long before Rebellion released it. Enemies still hit a little further than their model can reach, you still kick a little further than your model can reach, you still have to stop and press E to loot a body for ammo, and grenades are still difficult to control. There are a couple things that I ran out of room to discuss within my prior review, but I'm glad that it gives me something to talk about here.While this spin-off series is indeed challenging, especially on higher difficulties, many of the confrontations can be completely sidestepped by backing yourself into a room with a narrow corridor; many of which are stockpiled with ammunition. In almost every instance when you're faced with a ""siege"" or ""assault"" moment where large hoards of undead Nazi's come spilling your way, there's a perfect alcove for you to funnel the enemy through, making it nearly impossible for you to get hurt. Though it can be ignored, having it there takes away a large portion of the core game mechanics, and not to mention the proposed threat. The aforementioned also negates the need for the cover system, which I personally never used in either title.Even though Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 is clearly its predecessor dressed up with some new clothes it bought from the thrift store, it's still a fun wave-based zombie annihilation game. The new maps really help to keep the experience fresh, since they're so visually stunning and different than what came before. As for the story arc, it's lackluster at best but it serves an important purpose to what appears in Zombie Army Trilogy. As usual, the online portion of this game is dead, so if you're thinking about picking it up be prepared to play either solo or with friends. Recommended at a 75% discount, only if you want to play the original, otherwise pick up Zombie Army Trilogy instead.Rating:4.0/5.0- Excellent, highly worth playing.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

(If you get this reference, then you feel my pain)I got this game for free from a promotion and honestly it would have been worth the full price. If it ever hits a sale give it a shot!

Unfortunately, this game isn't as good as its predecessor. Which is a shame, because there are plenty of new zombie types that kept things interesting.The first problem comes with the way the zombies are animated. They often bug out, and twitch around at random. For example, sometimes, when they get knocked down, they pop back up in the standing position without any animation for a second. Another glitch is when they get stuck on each other and gets frozen in their animation as a result.The second, bigger problem is that, the level design is far more cramped, which is to the game's detriment, since this kind of gameplay demands the ability to outmaneuver the horde to a better sniping position, and there are certain spots in this game where that kind of luxury and mobility isn't afforded. In simpler terms, this game has a lot of dead ends that are death traps, and there are some cases where the only real way out is to push through, because those dead ends are unavoidable. This is in stark contrast to the first game where any instances of being trapped is the fault of the player, and not because of the level design. Another thing to add to this is that it seems to be specifically designed to spawn zombies on top of you out of the ground, which is also poor level design.Overall, while I do appreciate that they made the effort to make it not just more of the same, there isn't as much care out into the map design or QA done this time around. It is because of this that I cannot really recommend this game at full price. If you see this game on sale, then by all means, do pick it up, but $15 is a bit more than what this game is worth. Which is a shame, because in Single Player, it is 4 Hours worth of Zombie shooting with a solid netcode to go with the Co-op mode. If you are curious about this franchise, I would recommend that you pick up the first game instead of this, and only pick this up if you have to play more of it."

Released within the same year as the first one, will this be the game you want to play ?Story wise this game picks up as soon as the first one ends. We are dropped of by the boat on a dockside and we have a goal, we need to collect three relics which can stop the zombie apocalypse. Just like the first one it's not much of a story, cause apart from the recordings you hear in safe rooms and the pre-mission briefings, there's not much exposition.Now for record, I'm not a massive fan of Sniper Elite apart from Sniper Elite 2 which I fairly enjoyed.  Gameplay is a carbon copy of the first one and Sniper Elite 2. Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 feels like a mod rather than a full game. Everything from the menu and mission goals are borrowed from the first game. I felt like this was a cheap money grab than a full sequel.Soundtrack is the game's strongest feature. I love the synth music and it reminded me of the awesome horror movies that came out in the 80's.There's really not much to say about NZA 2 since it's basically the same game as the first one. I will try and to explain a bit more what I dislike about this series.The game is even harder than the first one. The combat takes place in small corridors and there's zombie hordes swarming you, so if you can't control the situation, you are pretty much done for.The game is even shorter than the first game. It took me 3 hours to finish the entire game and unless you plan on doing a second playthrough, it's not worth getting at full price.Overall this is a poor sequel and more like a cash grab. My honest suggestion is either get the two games on sale or get  the trilogy which is includes the first two remastered games which I hear are great. Overall Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a bad game and I don't suggest wasting money on it.Final Rating:4/10 - Wait for a discount or skipIf you liked this review please give it a like and if you disliked it, please post a comment on what you disliked."

,Recommended,247910,9313743,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,Mr Breeze,"After looking for another co-op game to offer something new compared to the Left 4 Dead series I stumbled on this during a sale.  For FPS fans, the 3rd person view will take a bit of getting used to but most of us these days have played from both perspectives.  I found the NORMAL mode very challenging so played on CADET for a bit until I got used to the play mechanics, loadouts, and gameplay.  After getting used to it, its not so bad on the more difficult levels.  There are multipart campaigns with designated safe rooms like L4D, but at the end of each campaign/mission it launches you into the next rather than simply ending as I suspect the last campaign is the ""ending/escape""The zombies swarm you but in a very different way than L4D because they don't rush at you with a full on sprint but rather just emerge and move in large groups that tend to overwhelm just in sheer numbers.  The game relies on focused shooting with critical and headshots rather than brute force (like some other zombie games).  I do like the fact that enemies don't just randomly appear all around you.  That used to bug the heck out of me in R6 Vegas 2.  After you a clear a room it should remain clear and enemies shouldn't just spawn in instantaneously.The ability to use more than just standard grenades and giving the ability to set trip mines and proximity mines is pretty sweet but be careful not to be too close when they go off.  And if you set them too early they do self-detonate after a fair amount of time.  Using grenades, and mines creatively is very effective against the boss characters as they will mow you down with their big guns of you try and take them head on.This game was so worth the $3.75.  Fun as hell and looks great.  The co-op is fantastic.  You can't go wrong!!"

It's a pretty standard zombie game but well made. I Co-Op'ed through the campaign with my dad and we never had any problems with the game itself. The only problems we had were occasionally sucking and getting eaten alive.Pros:- I like that you can turn up the difficulty in 2 different ways. (You can increase the number of zombies separately from making them hit harder. My dad and I chose to increase both because. . .zombies are supposed to be in swarms/deadly)- As difficulty increases realism also starts to come into play. Bullet drop and wind starts to become a thing that you have to be aware of.Cons:- If your low on time this is a hard game to manage.

Its way to easy really. ofcourse you can multiple the numbers of zombie heading towards you. but if you set everything on sniper elite mode. and not multiply the number of zombies that will be charging at you, its really too easy.also the range of explosives bums me out a bit. as the grenade does his work just fine. you can also shoot at barrels, fuel tanks and many many more, but the range of that explosive is soo miniscule that its really not worth it. also in a certain part of the game you need to activate a V2 rocket. but in real life Im pretty sure I cannot sit behind a corner and wait.Nevertheless its a fantastic game and its really worth the 11 euro's you need to pay for it.

Nazi Zombie Army 2 continues the template laid down by the original almost to a tee, offering a series of corridors and open levels in which to snipe and lay down traps for the incoming hordes, wrapping its premise around the loosest and silliest of plots. It’s still basic and slightly awkward, and it’s still 100% more fun when played with other people.Trading the Nazi soldiers for those of their undead cousins, Zombie Army 2’s combat takes shape as a series of shooting galleries, sometimes confined and sometimes open, often requesting the gang of four combatants to defend a specific location from assault on multiple sides. Physical barriers block progress until each and every last zombie has been dispatched back to the underworld, and a neat scoring mechanic allows for competition between groups as players vie for the highest tally of grenade kills, headshots and long-range bollock-busters (or the space where they used to be, anyway).My local Tesco has gone downhillThe plot, for those of you that are interested, takes into account Hitler’s plight in the original game, with his ‘Plan Z’ now in full effect and overpowering even his own bunker. In order to put a stop to the undead hordes you’ll need to find three pieces of an ancient artifact stashed away in various hellish locations far removed from the original’s re-used World War II assets, with the majority of the new environments swathed in devilish flames and lit with hues of orange and red.Just like its predecessor and the original V2 however, the sniping and gunplay mechanics remain largely the same in Zombie Army 2. The go-to weapons are unsurprisingly still a variety of WWII sniper rifles augmented with a steady-aim breathing gauge that recharges during combat, with secondary slots available for a machine gun and pistol. The latter two begin as fairly useless options as each level slowly unfolds, but soon become invaluable for popping groups of zombie heads whenever the shufflers breach defences and begin to swarm your position. A swift kick to the guts will also put them down in a pinch, but that solitary melee attack still lacks the crowd-control utility of alternatives found in the likes of Left 4 Dead, making it a little limp as a last resort.The planning and trapping aspects of Sniper Elite are also still in full effect here, played up to the maximum in the all-new levels designed specifically for Zombie Army 2. The array of options remain the same, encompassing two types of grenade, trip-wire explosives and dynamite. Working as a team to successfully booby trap a location and take down swathes of shuffling zombies is a satisfying experience when a well-thought-out plan comes together, and the frantic corridor-clearing when things fall apart is just as frustrating or enjoyable depending on your luck. And Rebellion obviously knows its onions regarding the elements players responded to best the first time around, as the level design in the sequel is far more accommodating. Siege locations are more prevalent with numerous cover spots and opportunities for funnelling the undead into carefully-laid traps, whilst machinegun ammo is found with a greater frequency, enabling more of those last-gasp firefights or desperate runs to revive a colleague. The range of special zombies are also augmented by a couple of new additions to the mix, with a fiery, fast-moving variety proving particularly tricky and the “summoner” constantly resurrecting fallen foes unless you take him out.That’ll be a tricky shot with a sniper rifleIt’s also very much still the case that if you’re playing Nazi Zombie Army 2 alone, then you’re in for a pretty dull experience. Despite the additions, the extended waves of enemies and narrow shooting galleries can still become a frustrating slog in singleplayer. In four-player co-op however, Rebellion’s title sputters to life with a satisfying blend of preparation and on-the-fly tactics, made all the better when you have to backtrack or wade into a crowd in order to help up a tardy or over-confident comrade. Being part of a well-oiled four-player sniping team is a huge amount of fun, and even the chaotic mess of an incompatible unit is good for a giggle while it lasts.strategyinformer.com"

It does require at the least a mid range pc to handle the game in an enjoyable manner. It's 4 player co-op, a lot of emphasis on the multiplayer part, because it isn't a story driven game. It's more of a ""shoot up zombies with your friends"" kind of game. There are cutscenes that explain what's going on, but it's not deep or very well thought out. But for $15 and probably cheaper because of sales, it's worth picking up if you've got someone else to play with."

You can still casually drop in and out of a co-op game, but I feel like the framerate isn't as good as the first one. Can also get repetitive after awhile."

This is by no means a bad game but should have been a DLC to the first game, not a sequel. As a sequel it is a completely suck♥♥♥♥♥waste of money ripoff. It should have been released only as a $5 DLC for the first game. What makes this so disappointing is that it is literally the EXACT same as the first game with almost no real noticeable changes besides a couple new enemies, some new maps, and a new story (who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about story in a game called Nazi Zombie Army lol). The story is barely there anyway. You just pick up relics at the end of levels and hardly anyone ever says anything. The double barreled shotgun (aka The Preacher) blows away a whole group of zombies with one blast. But you only get to use it for a little while and it does not transfer to the next level when it starts, so basically forget i even mentioned it. Total waste of time for them to even put it in the game. It seems like the zombies jerk a little more now making headshots harder, but maybe that's just me. These games should be called ""headshot simulator"" because anything other than a headshot is, half the time, a waste of ammo. And you need all the ammo you can get. Mostly though you will have enough ammo, just be smart with it. Snipe anytime you can, pistols to kill skeletons, and machinegun only when necessary.Overall the exact, and I mean EXACT same game as the first which makes it deserve the bad reviews it got, but some new environments are cool. Pretty solid and fun for maybe a week or two, meaning it is absolutely worth the sale price I paid of $3.74. Do NOT buy it at full price, wait for it on a big sale like I did. 6/10A pretty fun game to play through once, especially if you have a friend for co-op. The second game is passable since it is literally the exact same game as this just a few new maps and a couple new enemies, so only get it on sale cheap if you couldn't get enough of this one.If you want the third game forget about it. They decided to not sell it seperately, only in the ""Zombie Army Trilogy"" for $50 and from what I hear it is the exact same game as the first two so it's basically the biggest ripoff on steam and imo one of the dumbest marketing schemes I've ever heard of. It was just on sale in the 2016 winter sale for $8 and that is the only time it is worth getting to get all 3 games for cheap, only if you don't have any of them already. If it's over $8 don't bother because you can frequently find the first two games on sale for $3.75 each and the third game offers nothing new. It's also hilarious how they suddenly got scared to use the word Nazi anymore and went P.C. with their new game title."

But, eventually I hooked up again...So keep in mind, I'm not that ""Two-Decades-Long"" game veteran, my review will be nowhere near perfect!""Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2"" is basically my re-entry into ""shooters"" which I'd bought because also a friend did have it. At first, I assumed,  it was just a 'fly-by' burst of firey enthusiasm, which seemed likely 'not' to stay for any significant amount time. Nothing could be further from the truth. I'm really pleased playing the game and its online co-op campaign mode.I lack the experience for a more uptempo style game such as ""Call of Duty"", ""Counter-Strike"" and Half-Life. But in ""Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2"" most in-game enemies are relatively slow moving targets and which will lack 'even' the most of basic intelligence. (so provides the gamer with some additional extra thinking time).The fact that online multiplayer mode purely exists out of a co-op game makes it even more inviting to play in my case.Anyway, this is really a welcome gesture when 'like me', you decide to first check your game & skills to improve without being completely massacred almost immediately everytime.Overall.. very playable game for the majority of shooter fanatics, both beginners and pro's..

Not much has changed, even the main menu and the music is the same. It's far from a bad game, just maybe not as satisfying as you think. Sniping from long range is a blast, but any thing more close range is underwhelming. Sniping at close range is a pain and the SMGs and pistols feel nerfed. However, it is a good co-op title and the overall tone and atmosphere of the game is stellar. They did a great job with that. At the sale price of £2.50, it's a not a bad buy at all, but at full price not so much."

Unless of course you also like unpredictable plot, exciting gameplay, any story what-so-ever, and explanation of why the hell you are doing what ever you are doing in a zombie infested Germany. Overall, the game gets stale soooooo quickly, it's just, ""walk here"", kill a couple slow-moving brainless annoyances, ""Survive the siege!"", kill a couple of the 4 DIFFERENT ZOMBIE TYPES, rinse and repeat in a different place, over, and over, and over again. The sniping is really fun and rewarding, allowing you to feel good at videogames for a little bit, and the atmospheres are creepy and diverse, but thats about it.

Let's go snipe things.Of course, this game suffers from all the problems of the first: there's no story (possibly even less of one than before) and the focus is on an arcade experience where it usually makes more sense to use automatic weapons and pistols due to the close quarters than it does to snipe anything (despite the very name of the game).On top of that, this sequel hardly brings anything new to the table. There's two new enemy types, but that's it. No new guns or explosives. And all the environments are the exact same levels from Sniper Elite 2 - literally cut and pasted - with some lighting changes to dress them up in a poor attempt to make them feel different. But if you've already played that game (like I had) then you already know the layouts of all the levels here, making a quick run through even more tedious.In short: this is the laziest milking of a franchise I might have ever seen. It can't have taken much time or thought or effort for the developers to grind it out. I can imagine that it might be more fun to play with a full co-op team, but even then I wouldn't want to go through it more than once. There just isn't much here."

These games are best thought of as run and gun shooters, made in a 3rd person engne that is not designed for running and gunning, which happen to contain a few sniping set pieces. The sniping is also annoying as the lurching motion of the zombies makes landing a kill shot harder, which when there's a dozen coming for you from different angles makes the game plain old frustrating.Running and gunning is the majority of the game and is just poorly handled. Sniping is the minority of the action and frequently devloves into running and gunning as the dead get around your position. It's tense, which is probably the best thing you can say for the game, but it feels like your deaths are due to the gameplay rather than your own actions."

First off it still rips off all the maps from Sniper Elite V2 and the only thing new is that you changed the graphics on the map to make it look more spokey. Second this game is still set up as if it was a sniping game instead of a Close Quarter Combat game which it real is. Third the zombies seem to twitch when the move around so head shots are very hard to make especially since you have to run around a lot, because if you crouch walk through this whole game your good as dead. Forth and related to the thrid and second point if the zombies get within 10inc infront of you they will star trying to hit you which increases there spead and makes it hard to hit them especially if they are already on top of you. Fith the ammo in this game is like a diamond in minecraft very hard to find unless you souly rely on your pistol and rifle as SMG ammo is hard to find, and when you find the shotgun ammo will extremely hard to find, wich sucks since the shotgun is the best gun to use. Sixth the mini boss zombies can only be killed by head shots which returning back to point two, three, and four getting your heart beat to slow down enough to make perfect head shots is extremely hard especially when they can shoot back or turn every zombie around you into a flaming zombie on steroids. Seventh the shotgun takes longer to load than it should and with the Revolver it should take half the amount of time since the ammo you pick up is in a speed loader, yet he manually loads every single round (I was hoping that in this instalment of the game they would fix that). Finaly this game is set up to be 4 players and even the single playre mode treats it as if you had 4 people or even 1 other person playing with you.I have played a lot of zombie games including inde zombie games, but never have i feelt so disapointed in a zombie game since Day Z came out. This series is now one of the worst zombie games I have ever played.So in conclusion dont buy this game its a complete rip off and will stress you out majorly that is unless you can actualy find someone to play with you then it may be a little more easy, but it still isnt worth your money."

,Not Recommended,247910,21636975,"Posted: 5 March, 2016",all,Hausu,"Where do I even begin with this game. First off ive been playing this game for about 7 years now and every playthrough ive had of it was exellent. There is alot of variety when it comes to builds. There is the obvious Light/Dark or Grey option for the game but there is also Force user builds, Ranged builds, Pure combat focused guardian, etc. I find the combat to be enjoyable (In my opinion) since its tactical and you can really plan attacks and things of that sort. Take DA:0 for example. Its pretty much the same system. You can start with 3 beginning classes: Guardian (Combat focused), Sentinel (Better skill progression), and Consular (Force powers). You then later in the game get different set of prestige classes depending on your allignment. Now, lets get to the writing of the game. This game has one of the best stories I have ever seen. You'll see once you play it for yourself. The reason I prefer this game slightly over the first is just because I prefer the darker, philosophical, grey aspects of the atmosphere and story a bit better (Kotor 1 is also one of my favorite games). Anyways, this game presents the idea that Dark is not necessarily evil and Light isnt nessesary good and you really get to see the Flaws of both sides. For example, you play as the Jedi Exile, who was exiled from the Jedi order for rusing to war to protect innocents. The Jedi were lazy and waited to ""evaluate the threat"". The dialouge and voice acting in this game is absolutely fantastic (Especially Kreia). For this game, you dont even need to be a fan of Star Wars. A non Star Wars fan would look at this game and just play an RPG. However a Star Wars fan would look at this and play an amazing Star Wars RPG. The reason for this is because the game is set in an era wayyy before the Movies. One flaw however, would be the cut content presented this game. Obsidian (The developers) were rushed to release this game by lucasarts, resulting in them needing to cut out content for the game. Luckily, a group of community modders managed to get into the games files and restore alot of the content that was cut. You can find the mod on the steam workshop. Anyways, hurry up and buy the game! You wont be dissapointed."

Story and scenery are great. Whereas, in most sniping games (especially in the advanced shooter settings) often times you have to watch and anticipate the movements of your target for proper shot placement. With practice a sniper can become pretty efficient. However, trying to judge and anticipate the jerky movements of the undead are alot more challenging. Great game, lots of fun.

It is a zombie game which continues the story of Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army (senza). This game is quite similar to senza 1, it just continues the story and improves a little bit of graphic issues, the rest stays the same. You have 4 characters, one of which is the protagonist of Sniper Elite 3, you will try to collect all the fragments with 0-3 players and escape Berlin.This game contains a lot of blood and gore, but it gives the players a good feeling each time the players make a headshot, and is sometimes challenging to fight at the same time the Panzer soldier (the small boss) while trying to kill other zombies around him at the same time.However, I found this game not terrifying while it does give us an atmosphere of fear, this can be good (or bad) for the players trying to play through the campaign.I recommend this to all the fans of senza 1.Positive remarks+graphic improvement+story continuing+only talents and accuracy, no campingNegative remarks-doesn't have big changes in comparison with senza 1I think that's it, nothing much more to say."

The graphics are really good compared to the price. Single player is fun, but multiplayer is really where it's at playing with other people. Single player is good for practicing and if you're interested in the story line at all.I only have two complaints: First, the servers can be abit glitchy and laggy. If you've got a good team of 4, then it shouldn't pose as much of a problem. If they are all in your face, well, prepare to die and hopefully a team mate can heal you up.Second: Mission length. I wasn't sure if it actually saved at a check point or not, but the very first mission in the game was almost an hour long. I admit taking a breather every so often at a save room, but really, this is just too long for a casual game. Multiplayer missions aren't as bad, but do plan on being at the computer for awhile during a match.Other then those two complaints, the game overall is great. A very minor complaint is although the ""Matrix"" slowomo stuff is cool, it does get old, especially if you prefer to be a sniper like I do. Overall, for how much the game is, and the entertainment it provides, I highly suggest you try it out. See ya in game."

The grim, gloomy atmosphere and fantastic ambient sound really added to the ""last man/men alive"" feel. The Co-op shooter could get dull however, with little to no varying game mechanics to be seen after unlocking and equipping a few different guns, its sequel may has well have been a DLC expansion to the original.Overall?

I've played pt 2 for maybe 10 mins and I can already say I'm pretty disappointed. Not in the game in general, but in the fact that they've released a game that doesn't really include anything new in terms of weapons/story and not really any new mechanics (which is not really as important in a sniper elite mod/ expansion). Sure, they released a new campaign which I've yet to fully experience, but this game, if anything, should've been an add-on to the original Nazi Zombie Army. The series itself appeals to me because the zombies are the slow shambling type and headshots are completely required to survive which makes it a bit ""realistic"" and the sniping x-ray mechanic is really awesome. I can't recommend this game to someone that's already bought pt 1 unless they really enjoyed it like I did. As for people that haven't played pt 1 I'd recommend this game but only after u've watched a few youtube vids and if u've got a few extra dollars lying around. As for everyone, just to prove a point to the develepor, only buy this game on a steam sale like i did. I'm sure u will enjoy it solo like I did and love it playing co-op, but still, just buy this game on sale.Graphics are good so long as you have a decent graphics card cuz it runs really well on my pc which has a nvidia gtx 560ti. Anything below that, just be careful. a lot of people that have posted reviews here stating that it's not properly optimized. It runs very well for me on high settings.I would give this a thumbs down because it's a ♥♥♥♥ING expansion to NZ1 but I've enjoyed the series enough to give it a thumbs up. Just don't pay $15 for it. Support the developer, not for a $15 expansion, but for the idea that a pretty cool zombie $15 game could be expanded upon. Buy it. Only on a decent steam sale."

There aren't many improvements over the first NZA game - in fact, it uses mostly the same maps (some taken from Sniper Elite V2, others taken from NZA 1), and uses the same final boss.  So in that regard, it was clearly phoned in.  But on the other hand, I can't deny how fun it is.  Sniping zombies didn't get old in the 3.5 hrs it took me to play the 5 levels of the campaign.  The controls are tight, I didn't run into any glitches, and the first level was beautiful in it's hellish look.  If you're deciding which to pick up, I'd get the first NZA game, but if you liked that one, this gives you more of the same."

The difficulty has also been a constant problem with this series. Players just found this game to be too easy, even on Sniper Elite difficulty.

The individual missions are few, but very long. There's a few annoyances (If you die, you can't rejoin a game in progress, and you can't save in the middle of the missions between sessions). But overall, the experience was tremendously enjoyable and entertaining.The game play is mostly of the form ""go from A to B, through a horde of zombies"". Sometimes you have to do ""seiges"" in which a bunch of zombies spawn and you have to kill them. At all points it felt pretty organic - you just go around killing zombies as you see best, and you're not really locked into any given strategy most of the time. There's a variety of weapons (Sniper Rifles, SMG's, and pistols are your guns, while you have trip mines, land mines, grenades (2 types) and dynamite for your explosives and traps. You can also get two types of shotguns (though only off the ground in some missions). The gun handling is superb, as you'd expect.I recommend it, especially if you like zombie games, or sniping games (though there are few chances for real long-range sniping)."

And i didnt play the first game. i would pick this game up on sell like i did for a little under 5 buck. the game is worth it at that price and make sure atleast you have one friend willing to play it with youfour broken zombie skulls out of five :)"

,Recommended,247910,34405923,Posted: 21 August,all,Take A Bow,"Nazi Zombie Army 2, what can I say about it? Well for starters, it's much harder to find a online match oddly for this game, then for NZA 1 or Zombie Army Trilogy. I wouldn't say it's bad, I mean who doesn't love shooting undead zombie snipers and fighting bigger and badder Johnny Storms? It's a good game nevertheless and the music in the saferooms I'll say, are much eerier if played with headphones as is the case with most Zombie Games.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCew6VZnGv0"

76561198138487217,Recommended,247910,35010088,Posted: 16 September,all,.:BnErTt:.,"Heil Zombie Hitler!This game has it all! Zombies, cool guns, more Zombies, fridges that contain heads that are on platters, suicide Zombies, Zombies that try to snipe you in the face, gold bars that you will find in strange spots, even more Zombies and the best part about it all is watching those bullets fly through the air, ending up in a Zombies gullet. If you're like me and love all types of Zombie games, then this game is for you! I'm pretty sure this is Rebellion's way of informing us all in the most discreet way that Hitler was actually turned into a mega-Zombie after turning all of his SS into Zombies! I usually try to find at least one aspect of each game that could be better but this game is total gold!"
