A series of rather high quality in-depth action rpg's made into a simplistic, almost primitive arcade-style game I would expect as a gaming hall or browser title, not a full-price wanna-be blockbuster. An all-use ingame currency instead of diverse loot, near to no armor or weapon variation and customization. As well as hardly any attack or skill variation: light attack, heavy attack (shield breaker), and 2 skill slots with 5 alternatives to use in each, that's it, no diverse combat, just button mashing. Linear and quite limited maps instead of a living, breathing, npc-settled open world. One mission / level after the other with point recap in between, just like stages in a 90's arcade side-scrolling game.I'm usually the last one to totally dismiss a game but I can only advise anybody to never touch this one, especially if you expected this to be a diablo / sacred style action rpg. Console port is in fact a very small excuse for (imho) destroying a (rather) popular and quite high quality game series like this."

They both had decent stories and character progression. My advice for franchise fans, is to go replay sacred 1 and 2, skip this. If you pre-ordered like I did... I am so sorry. This game doesn't even pretend to be the same genre.This is an isometric brawler with very limited combat. There are no selection of combos, no character customizaton, no hot swapping skills, and no loot! You pick from a limited selection of skills (you get 2 in mission, from a limited pool), and a selection of weapons that are nigh identical, but must be unlocked through the story. Combat is repetitive, oh so repetitive. Controls are somewhat awkward on the PC. This seems to be geared more towards a console platform in that regard.The voice acting is decent, and for sacred fans, the cheesy lines are still there, but that may be all that remains. There is little to no character development, and the story itself seems to be a tired reincarnation of ""evil being attempts to destroy world for some reason"".Graphics are not bad... not great, but they certainly could be worse.If you want a simple brawler, this is alright, but not worth the $50 price tag (there are similar, much cheaper titles available).

There may be several reasons for this: I just came from the 3 week old Divinity: Original Sin, a masterpiece in its own genre, and wanted to have a blast in an aRPG like sacred. I grabbed the game for 50 euro and 8 euros worth first-day dlc aswell. Downloaded 18gigs of game and threw myself at it. I had an expectation of some openworld freedom alike Sacred 1 & 2, lootdrops, any basic kind of character customization and I hoped for an engaging story.. this is not what I got - at all. These first 45 minuttes in the game made me angry, so angry and dissapointed that im going out for a walk now.Never have I ever  wanted to ask for a refund for a game, but this.. this is a justified request. the layout is but a given path, with a few stairs. thats it. You left/right-click everything to death, and are given 2! abilities to bring to use. it seems like you can swap them around later on though. there is no strategy, no tactical gameplay given, just a bloody 1 track pathway to walk down. It feels like supermario in a nice package & an unbelievable high pricetag.I would not ask you to neglect this game, just get a firm grasp of what it is you are getting for your money. My expectations were completely elsewhere and thus I cannot recommend this game.TL:DR This games only similarity to the sacred franchise is the lore.

This game is an insult to the original fans of Ascarons Sacred franchise. It appears to be nothing more than a cash cow for Deep Silver.You have four races to initially choose from (the fifth race is DLC). No open world. A linear mission quest line. Your equipment consists of two items; an armoured suit (which can be upgraded but NOT replaced) and a weapon (which you can upgrade and replace). No loot drops other than gold, health orbs, energy orbs and weapon spirits. Skills, armours and weapons can only be upgraded/unlocked/bought with gold after meeting level requirements. You cannot directly upgrade your characters attributes. Levelling a character increases your health and may increase combat arts energy. Completing the relics quests (stars missions on map) will unlock new items for you to buy in store and increasing capacity is done in the circle missions. You can only equip three skills at a time; a light combat art, a heavy combat art and a battle prayer (the battle prayer is co-op only). Upgrading and equiping can only be done outside of the mission quest. More bonus gold can be earned by using combos and playing co-op (this will heavily impact single player as your gold will increase much more slowly). There's no real strategy other than bashing buttons to kill your enemies with combos which becomes boring after a while due to its repetitive nature."

This game is definitely not a Sacred. Apart from the story, it doesn't have to do anything with its predecessors. Compared to Sacred 1 & 2, this game is actually a huge step backwards:- only 4 character classes available- you can't name your character- there are no items- no open world, only a linear way (and what's making it worse: you can't even go back)- the player character doesn't autogenerate its health over time (instead you have to collect green balls to refill your health)- you just have 2 skills + 2 different attacks with your weapon- the player character and enemies don't comment their actions- fighting against enemies turns into stupid click orgies- the game doesn't remember the resolutionOn top of that I miss the typical Sacred-style humor, when the game doesn't take itself serious - be it quests or comments made by NPCs, enemies or the player character when doing certain actions."

There are no item pick ups.  The world is broken into a progressive map of paths to follow.  The only things you pick up are health, energy (to power your abilities) and gold.Sacred 3 is now very similar to diablo 3 in terms of abilites.  You are given the opportunity to buy abilities and upgrades to those abilites with gold.  But you must also be a certain level to get those upgrades.  You also only get different items (weapons/armour) as you progress through the game levels.  There are no luck of drops for items.Sacred 3 now seems to be an ARCADE style hack and slash.  I feel the focus of this game is now on the multiplayer/co-op aspect.  I dont think this is either a good or bad thing.  Just as long as people are aware that this is now a very different game to what it used to be.So far Im not a big fan of the story for the campaign of this game.  It seems a mish mash of the same old ""bad guy"" out to destroy the world.  The 'cut scenes"" are filled with corny lines that I assume are supposed to amuse young children.This game is still fun, but as long as you can let go of what the Sacred games used to be.

The experience is closer to a very generic bland and mindless beat'em all. Disappointing, 3/10In spite of all the rather poor ""preview"" articles, I persisted in thinking Sacred 3 couldn't be *that* bad and decided to purchase the game (pre-order, mind you...). After all, a hack'n slash IS a hack'n slash, right ? Well... not quite :/The game does present itself as an ""arcade hack'n slash"", but it is actually only a brainless beat'em all.Fantasy action games can take a wide range of shapes and forms, but let's be clear... What do people enjoy in h&s games ? Ignoring all the details, in the most abstract form it fits in 4 major points :- Finding items, to improve their strength ; an endless gear treadmill to become more and more powerful- Optimising their character, by leveling up, equipping armor pieces, favouring offense/defense stats choices, etc.- Defining their experience through gameplay choices (skill tree or similar, inventory, stats, etc. or any combination of the above)- Combat ! Well, that's the core of the action, so... It should be ""fun"", aka ""challenging & rewarding""Sacred 3 does not support any of these gameplay elements. The game has as much depth as Golden Axe. This is like Dungeon Hunter 4 on PC, without the (few) fun bits.Enter a small area ; defeat a bunch of enemies (read ""spam LMB"", pro-tip use skills 1-2 to kill things faster) ; collect meaningless orbs ; move onto next area ; rinse & repeat. After a few times, BOSS ! Yeaah, exciti... ah, no. My bad. You can spam LMB, but can you dodge AND spam ? Oh, you can ? I guess you're too good for this game, well done, you cleared a mission ! How interesti...zzzZZZZZ...Seriously, how can a game decently call itself a h&s without having a loot system !I am not very far into the game myself (and probably never will be...) but I understand the base campaign can be completed in less than 10 hours on the first playthrough.

The rpg bits of the game consists of a map that opens up as you unlock more battles and gives you the abilty to buy and upgrade, other wise you can think of this as much of an 'champions of norath' like console game.The voice acting in my opinion is annoying what with the narators of the good and the bad sides sounding like a hip yes someone is trying to sound like a hippy school teen girl and another that sounds like a corny cowboy both argueing with each other.If you like hack and slash gameplay then this is for you but if you wanted an rpg like its predecessors then pretend you never saw this game as its clearly milking the name of a game that no longer plays like a game using the 'Sacred' name."

The background dialogue is extremely cheesy to the point it's almost as if they were not trying. I got tired of listening to it, and I had to turn it off, which if you knew me, you would know I can exert a fair amount of patience, but this was consistant inane chatter that didn't in any way provide to the story.2.) I was admittedly taken aback by the genre change, I consider it my fault that I did not research about the game before it came out, however I did not expect them to make such a drastic change in gameplay from what was a great breath of fresh air if you were either tired of or not really into diablo.  Anyways, it is very linear, no choices, and your guided by an annoying half-wit.3.) Character customization is rather limited, you have weapons to choose from that have various percent chance passives, and 2 sets of skills with 2-3 choices each, which inside, have only 1-2 customizations inside there.  Which is a drastic reduction in skills from the previous Sacred titles.  As far as loot and weapons and feeling the ""reward"" from killing a boss just forget about it.  You get some gold coins, which you lose almost immediatly because the game was designed for you to farm the same levels OVER and OVER and spend it on upgrades for your character.4.)  In the story levels, you are forced into silly scenarios where an elite just happens to have the key you need, to a door that will continue your journey.  Maybe it's nothing, but with previous arguments of the perception of them not trying very hard, this kinda rubs me the wrong way.  I spent more time thinking of why the first antagonist did the classic ""AHA I have destroyed your only way to me, EXCEPT for this one LOCKED door, to which I put the key in my minions hands!  I shall make this mistake repeatedly, over and over, and NEVER learn from my mistakes!"".  You would think the emperor would eventually put out an all points bulletin reminding his generals NOT to leave keys with their subordinates.5.) Oh and something was buggy with the online portion of the game, I wanted to try teaming up with random strangers and was stuck in offline mode for some reason.

I was well aware of the community's warnings and disapproval, but I still got it for the sake of clarity and some itch to keep supporting a previously good developer. Even though it isn't even Ascaron Entertainment that is behind it, I still felt they wouldn't let a game reputation like Sacred slip so easily into wrong hands. (Which... It seems they might actually have..)First and foremost, the story...The first game was brilliant where magic was just magic, where you had to gather elements to defeat a loose Sakkara demon. As fantasy-RPG as it gets.The second game then tried to explain how everything magical was actually run by T-energy, which had started pouring into the world and corrupt it. For the sake of the story, I won't spoil more than that, but it had enough going to keep you going to see what was behind it all.But now with the third game, I don't see any of the T-energy or any enticing lore that keeps you wanting to progress through the story. On top of that, they made it entirely linear, even less open-worlded than Diablo.Gameplay...First and second game was a lovely free-roaming RPG with vast maps and plenty of quests to do along the main one. It was also hack-n-slash and focused on classic gear gathering and skill-progressing. And the combo system in the first game was brilliant, to say the least.Sacred 3 has lost all of this, except the hack-n-slash. No excitement for finding legendary gear and enhance it, no stunning combos which they otherwise boasted about a whole lot, compared to previous games AND went to feel like a side-scroller instead of open-worlded.Pros and Cons about the game...To try not comparing it with the previous games, since it's obviously not; looking at it as the ARPG, hack-n-slash it tries to be, I have to admit it's still fun and challenging and accomplishes what it tries to do. I can imagine it works perfectly fine on console and I find myself compelled to continue playing just to see how powerful I am capable of becoming, but I can already imagine that it turns into a boring grind when you start up new characters after first run through. Controls feels weird when using keyboard/mouse though, so I'd recommend a controller.So, pro is that they managed to make a decent isometric brawler, but lacks a lot compared to other brawlers.The cons is that they went WAAAY off their usual way, making one question if they just made it to try expanding into the console and DLC world for the sake of money.Finally, my recommendation...If you are a fan of the previous Sacred games, don't buy this. You'll be severely disappointed and likely come to hate yourself for buying it.If you like side-scrolling, hack-n-slash, brawlers with beautiful graphics and fairly challenging combat (If you play on the hardest difficulty) and don't mind that the price is fairly high due to the title's previous reputation. I would still not recommend it, compared to other brawlers or hack-n-slash. Bastion, Transistor and Diablo does a far better job."

,Recommended,247950,28347602,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,Reliant39,"All the (extremely) negative reviews on here boil down to one complaint: Sacred 3 is nothing like its predecessors. It isn't an ARPG. Instead, it is -- as the description already makes clear -- an isometric, arcade-like hack-and-slash game, or to put it in even simpler terms: a topdown brawler, similar to Gauntlet. In fact, I'd say it's better than Gauntlet: quicker, more fair, and more colourful. The ""humour"" I could have done without, but it's lame enough to be easily ignored.The bottom line is simply this: if you're invested in the earlier Sacred games, you're better off giving this a miss. If, on the other hand, you don't care at all about the earlier Sacred games, and approach this as the arcade brawler that it is, you're likely to enjoy it quite a bit. Me, I came to this game after having played Sacred Citadel and Castle Crashers, and it fits into that niche quite nicely.This is, by the way, a great game to also play casually with a friend."

It is highly disappointing for the type of game a Sacred player would be expecting.No open world. It is a linear path at all times, no sidequests to be had. You can go back and forth along the story path to select and re/play missions, but the freedom to explore is simply not there.No loot to find. You earn gold and a limited selection of new items/item levels/skills, then must upgrade the the items and skills with the gold you earn. A dull and uninteresting system coming off of Sacred and Sacred 2.I cannot recommend this game as a sequel to the Sacred franchise. Maybe under a different name and a lower price, it would be worth playing.ETA: I have, since first writing this review, discovered that the game WILL NOT keep my privacy/online settings.

The kind where you just switch off your brains and mow down enemy hordes.On the one hand, the fundamentals are kind of solid (if uninspired), the graphics are decent and there's quite a bit of variety. On the other hand, you've got nearly everything else. I'll get into its writing in a second, but I do need to mention that the design is awful; some of the character progression is actually ok for this sort of thing, but others just... pop up, randomly, with no explanation or logic. Some of the combat systems are ridiculous, too - there's a ""fatality"" type move that you can pull on bosses where you just... immobilize them, and inflict tiny bits of damage. Took me a while to figure out that it's meant for co-op play; as a solo player, it's ridiculous that it's still available as an option without getting buffed up. You expend your healing Items throughout the missions without any way to recover them, which means that you may reach the end boss- where you'll likely need them the most - without them unless you refrain from using them.None of the design problems are a huge issue except when the difficulty spikes up, in which case you'll spend a fair amout of time cursing at the screen (the last underworld mission, especially its boss, is one of the worst ""♥♥♥♥ you's"" I've ever seen designers aim at their paying customers). But that's an isolated case, difficulty has been fine elsewhere.I got this mainly to play co-op with my wife, who loves this sort of thing ever since Baldur's Gate - Dark Alliance; the problem is that after watching me play a couple of levels, she wants nothing to do with it. The writing is just that ♥♥♥♥ing, offensively bad. Offensive in its stupidity, not in any sort of premeditated, comedic way. It's disposable fantasy twaddle without the slightest hint of personality except for a smug sense that it's the funniest thing ever, even though it doesn't seem to understand the basics of a joke. You get bombarded with its noxious brand of humor throughout the missions, and it's almost painful. Let me put it this way, it throws in a Larry the cable guy quote at one point. It's even less funny without any sort of context.TLDR version - It's a brain dead, ok-ish action-RPG with a really obnoxious personality and some pretty stupid design decisions. I'm kind of enjoying it... kind of, and even that in a sort of MST3K way. However - even if it sounds like your kind of thing, wait until it's at about 10% of its current price (shouldn't be long!).It won't be worth it even then, but it's not like there are a lot of couch co-op, controller-enabled games for the PC."

The only parts that remind you of Sacred 1 and 2 are the race names and some of the highly corny (comicly so ... its delibrate) writing.Its very much a Gauntlet style game which should be clear if you watch the trailers or read the description and I was a big fan of Gauntlet in the arcade days ... not as much fun on a PC though its still worth the price of admision.So to be clear, for what it is I do recomend it, this is a far more polished title than 1 or 2 but you cant really compare them as games since they are completly different genre, styles, etc. If you are looking for more gameplay like you remimber from Sacred 1 or 2 dont bother looking here."

So bad in fact that it all borders on being malicious.  I can only assume that the developers had a meeting at some point to look at what Sacred 1 and 2 was and then made the decision to take everything that was not so good in 1 and 2 and make it even worse. Of course there where some good things in 1 and 2 as well they had a look and these and decided that the best thing would be to do exactly the opposite.  This is sure to win the hearts of the Sacred fans....oh wait. I guess they rather went out to win the hearts of some new fans.....why then call the game Sacred 3, why not something else, why go through the tedium of some small references to the previous games and it world when you could have done your own thing. Oh but it slipped my mind, this in not intended to be a good game the intention of this was to cost the developers as little as possible so they could put out a piece of software shaped faeces that they could sell for a quick buck.Speaking of the quick buck, as it it a pretty substantial buck, what does this actually buy you? You get a bunch ruler like linear levels, sewn together in a way that makes zero sense, half decent graphics, voice acting that would have been better if they were done by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gorilla with a railroad spike through its head. The only thing that seems half fair considering the price it the download size of the game....it.....is...huge. This is probably the only thing that the developers Keen games achieved, I wouldn't have though that it would be possible for such a large download to translate to so little content, but they managed it. Just so the noteworthiness of this is not missed, games the size of single a CD translated to hundreds of hours of playtime, where they managed to get 4 DVD's worth of game to only last 10 hours, nice.... Speaking about the size, at the end of the credits it actually gives credit to some or other compression algorithm.....everyone should be well warned never use this as it is clearly beyond useless.It also struck me from the credit that there were probably 10 times more QA's involved with the game than anything else. They, as along with everyone else, were clearly not doing their jobs.In conclusion what you get with Sacred 3 is a shameless, pathetic money-grab turd dressed up in a Sacred frock. Done by a bunch of useless developers that should probably look for a different line of work. Hopefully the curse of Sacred will find them as well.

So if you are looking for ""loot"" to satisfy your inner packrat munchkin you are out of luck.The playstyle is buttonsmashing in coop and is allot of fun to do with people you know. However when playing solo you will start to notice the repetitiveness of the buttonsmashing and the ""rails"" of this rollercoaster ride.The game is called Sacred 3 and as such it is part of a  brand line (the 3 in it's name would be a big hint)However where sacred 1 and 2 are open world games with multi tiered skill and loot gathering, Sacred 3 is more of a hack and slash on rails. Also the Seraphim player character which has returned in every sacred game does not look like the ones used in the previous game or even like the one used in the boxart and trailer!The above mentioned odities really give the impression that the publisher has been abusing the name and image of a fairly populair brand to  milk some extra cash.This does not mean it is a poor game, as it is actually a fun game in short bursts, but when you look at similar games, the pricetag of Sacred 3 is really on the expensive part of the comparison scale.So if you are like myself who buys a game on faith and happy memories of previous installments.... then this is an excellent example of why you should always read reviews before buying."

This isn't an action RPG game like any Diablo game or Torchlight game or Path of Exile, It's a beat 'em up game just like a host of other people are saying. No loot system only an upgrade system. You can unlock other weapons and upgrade them individually but it would require a lot of grinding to do so, since gold progression is relatively slow. The upgrade paths for each weapon don't differ from one another much either. It will come down to which one you think looks the coolest and that is the one you will use. You unlock 'combat' abilities very slowly and then you have the option to upgrade them much like your weapon/armor. But it's just too damn slow. You can upgrade it at lvl 4 and then you have to wait until lvl 12 and then lvl 20 for the next and lvl 33 for the next. Some have even bigger gaps it's really annoying. Why do I have to wait that long to do +20% more damage and or +50% radius or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's just bonehead design. Also these upgrades will cost thousands of gold. If it's a weak ability it will start at several hundred and increase to several thousands. But the better abilities in the game start at quite a lot and will cost you tens of thousands in gold combined just to finish the upgrade tree. Why would this game be such a grind fest? Especially when it's boring and repetetive in the first place. If you have to absolutely play this game do it with friends because solo is just boring and yes like many others have said the NPC chit-chat is obnoxious.Honestly the game insults my intelligence as will it yours. It does have bugs including getting stuck on invisible walls, bosses, corners and other♥♥♥♥♥♥that will force you to restart the entire level. Also much like people are saying, the game is not worth $50 or even $25. It's a $20 and under game. There isn't enough gameplay variety and it's a grind fest. Also if you like to make your own character you cannot, you can't even name your character they're just pre-made. It doesn't bother me but some people are really into customization and this game has very little, if any.I am playing the game on the hardest difficulty and it's just easy-peasy. Play it on the easiest... You would probably die in-game from falling asleep at the keyboard/controller.Steer clear of this. It's a complete consolized game. The graphics do not impress. They look a little better than Titan Quest graphics with better atmospheric lighting."

No inventory, no items, no real levels, no free roam, no diversity (the characters while all different, all play exactly the same often known as balancing) no challenge.At absolute best this game has an entertainment ceiling of about 14 years old, anyone past that will find it hard to maintain interest.There is another game available on steam called Dungeonland, this is pretty much a prettier version of that game that also costs 10x its price. whilst the game does look quite pretty and smooth, it seems more like a 3d version of Golden Axe.I stopped playing this after i bugged out and got stuck in terrain. This happened a few times, i simply exited the level and then began again, however, it happened multiple times and so that was it for me. This is not the reason i do not recommend this game, however everything does contribute.If you are still interested in this game, i suggest checking youtube for some in game clips, or maybe see if anyone is playing it on twitch.tv or a similar streaming site.I was really in the mood for something with such a rich and lustrious history and reputation as sacred too :*("

This game is a very simple, very linear, hack and slash.  You travel along on a terribly confined, predetermined pathway killing mobs.  At the end of each pre-defined pathway, there is a ""boss"" style mob.  You kill the boss mob and finish that pathway.  You move on the the next ""pathway"" and do the same thing again-over and over.  That is the game in a nutshell.  The scenery isnt engaging in the least and there arent any ""drops""(random or otherwise) of items or equipment to make the game interesting.  All that drops is gold but I havent played long enough to know what the gold is supposed to be used to buy.  I may never play that long.As far as comparing this game to previous Sacred games;  In many, many cases I have found that a new game in a series is pretty good but doesnt meet the expectations of those who played previous installments so the new installment gets a bad rap.  That is not the case with Sacred 3.  Sacred 3 deserves a bad rap all on its own merits.  Previous Sacred games are very busy games with a ton of things to do, tons of plot and sub-plot to remember story and quest wise, and lots and lots of interesting equipment drops and so on.  In truth, Ive always thought that previous Sacred games are TOO busy lol!  Anyway, Sacred 3 is not busy at all.  Sacred 3 is mindless in fact.  As I said above, you travel down relatively short corridors killing everything that comes at you, kill a boss and then you're done till the next corridor.  That is it.  Also, I think the charector scripts are supposed to be amusing but it comes of only as juvenile and silly.  Like another reviewer said; ""Turn off the sound to make the game a little better"".   Bottom line is that $3.74 is pretty cheap.  If you've got it to spare then buying this game probably wont be the worst decision that you've ever made.  BUT, should you chose NOT to buy Sacred 3, you wont be missing anything, I assure you."

You can take 2 Abilities on the missions which you also can alter between 3-5 between missions(so not much diversity). There are 3 Weapons per Class which are only different in their special ability. There is almost no such thing as Character development except the look of your Armour every few lvl ups. The Enemy types are repetetive and the level design is like a tube. After a few missions you get the feeling,you are playing the same lvl just with other skins and in another environment (which looks very pretty i have to admit). The Bossfights are somehow challenging at first try but then rather easy to accomplish.Sacred 3 is definitely a nice game for casuals and people who want to play with their friends a quick and simple coop game but for fans of the Sacred series and (i have to compare) Diablo like games, will be disappointed.After 9 hours or so i completed every mission and the day one dlc missions (5 in the Underworld).All in all this game is fun but has almost no replay vallue or longtime motivation and is never worth the 50€."

It's not because it's buggy or incompetently implemented - I haven't run into any actual bugs yet. It's because they took the basic design template for an ARPG then removed all the reasons why people actually play these games.I find it astonishing that nobody flagged these issues during development. I imagine a QA team asked to find bugs but told not to comment on actual gameplay. I imagine a producer with a ""vision"" of simplified play and nobody in a position to call bullsh*t.

This is the first review I have ever written. YES, this game is THAT bad. First let me say that I really enjoyed Sacred 2, which is why I commited to pre-purchasing this game. The character classes in this game don't really differ from one another. Yes, this one has a sword and that one an axe, and then another with 2 swords. With the exception of the bow, they pretty much do the same thing. A short arc swing in front of you and the ability to use a bash (no shield required or available) which also is a short arc swing in front of you. You can hold down the button to ""charge"" a bash to give it some range but it's still a very weak attack and all but useless except to interrupt enemies who are engaged in any long duration ability use. In this game you will find yourself going from map to map using the same abilities over and over against enemies that vary little. The terrain is tediously boring and there is no room to explore. You go the way they want you to go or you can go back the way you came. The weapon varieties are laughable as they all pretty much do the same thing with very little difference among them. Leveling up is a major let down. No stats to increase, no growth of your character. But every few levels you get the option to upgrade a weapon or one of the very limited abilities you want. You cannot switch armor, you can only upgrade what you have when you reach the appropriate level and graphically it is such a let down as there is no real change to how it looks. The voice overs from ""weapon spirits"" are laughably horrible. The plot is weak and shallow and all but non-existent. Online play: Your character will NOT be unique. Your Seraphim will be exactly like anyone elses Seraphim of the same level and since each class has only 1 viable weapon choice, (the others are just filler weapons that won't do as well) then you will each have the exact same weapon and be doing the same 2 or 3 maneuvers over and over until you finish a map. Gameplay: Run through each map killing whatever set monsters they throw at you until you reach the end of the map. Hit the portal then go to the next similar map again killing whatever set monsters they throw at you until you reach the end. Every 4th or 5th map there is a BOSS fight at the end. Boring combat of dodging predictable boss attacks and hitting them in the butt until dead. Then hit the portal and be prepared for yet another map of absolutely unexciting combat. This game lacks any variety, sense of character uniqueness, or flash. What you do in the first 2 minutes of game play is exactly what you will be doing after 3 hours of game play, it doesn't change or get any better. It is the biggest let down I can ever remember purchasing."

I became a little more skeptical after reading about some of the changes made (no longer open world / no more signifigant variety of loot), but I figured I was up for a new hack and slash experience, and it's Sacred III after all (What could go wrong?). In the end, I am rather more disappointed in that it feels more like a combo-game of Sacred and Dynasty Warriors, in the sense that it is interesting at first, but after a while (3-4 hours) I personally find myself getting bored. Graphics are solid, gameplay is fun, and the comedic charm is a matter of personal perspective as always. However, in the end, I must admit I have little interest in playing through on all the different characters, only becasue it feels like it might be a drag. I tried them all out through the first mission (apparently necessary at this point if you want to take them into the multiplayer feature) just to see which I liked the best, and after picking a favorite have decided to complete the game (whatever that might mean) with this character and then move onto something else.The biggest disappointment for me was how the whole image of competing with others for treasure was hyped (IMHO) and all it seesm to add up to is getting a little more gold / exp and the completion of a mission. I have no trophy display case or homebase to improve with all my glorious and hard-fought loot, rather I get a screen that is like, ""Hey, you killed the most guys, good for you, here is an extra percent to add to the pile.""Now all that said, if there was a signifigant increase to the amount of RPG / Loot /Upgrading side of the equation, whether through a solid patch, or more likely an expansion or DLC, I might consider playing the game further, but for now, I would recommed a purchase only if you are a fan of the Dynasty Warriors type experience, looking for a bit of a time sink, and the game is marked down for sale (think 50% off or more)."

The sequel to its predecessors leaves little to the ""Sacred"" title series, as it is far different--the ""red-headed step child""--the ""oddball"" of the three.  Unlike the first two games in the hit series, Sacred 3 is a very linear action RPG, and the term ""RPG"" is held very loosely and walks a very thin line.The graphics in the game are beautiful, detailed, and the environment rich and fairly interactive, and the combat is flowing and can bring a fun challenge, but it simply is not enough to save this game from the broken chains of what made this franchise so popular.  In Sacred 3, there is no exploration--so put away your maps, and every bit of directional video game intuition you have (or think you have).  Everything is based on a standard, linear, pre-planned map you choose from an overview screen after each level, with no way to go but ""forward"", and the occaisonal random dead-end so that you can loot that very special treasure chest.Speaking of loot, this game does not offer loot in terms of items, but only health and energy (used to cast your TWO powers you are able to use at any one time) and gold.  I repeat:  Loot DOES NOT DROP from mobs or foes that you so diligently vanquish like a good little hero.  Instead, weapons and armor (you only use one of each) are ""unlocked"" when the game says so--usually when hitting a milestone character level or completing a specific storyline mission.As far as storyline missions go, the story is decent and follows a logical path, but the side quests seem out of place (even for side quests), and the only objective you are ever given is ""kill them all""...all of them...again...and again.  And if you are too low for the recommended level of a certain quest you want to trudge through, guess what?  Tough luck.  Keep replaying missions until you ARE able to get to that level to defeat those quests.While I somewhat enjoy the fact that you must acheive certain character levels to unlock weapons, armor levels, and abilities, the idea in its own entirety seems hollow.  You loot gold, gold buys you skill and weapon upgrades, and you set those upgrades as active skills that you can use (you use one light skill and one heavy skill)--and normally when you find the best combination of skills, you stick with those, and the endless piles of gold you can grind out may as well be valued as worthless pebbles on the ground.There is no character development, other than the ""customizing"" of your two skills, weapon slot, and armor slot--and they all fall onto a linear path.  There is no developing character stats, no adding talents, no feats, no kind of character traits, no type of roleplaying element whatsoever.  And if you have seen one area-of-effect skill, you have seen them all.  The characters, while they each have their own personalities, offer very little difference in comparison to each other.Without a doubt, the game's strong point is its combat and its cooperative playstyle--and it gets old--quickly.  The hack 'n slash button mashing is very similar to the Dynasty Warriors style, with combos, shield breaking, knockdowns, executions, etc.  There isn't much combat variation throughout the entire game, and the fun feel you may have when starting to play the game quickly wears off after a multitude of repetitive side quests.  It's always fun to play with a buddy or three, which is what Sacred 3 offers--and is fantastic.  The difficulty scales to the number of players in the game, and while this CERTAINLY makes the game more enjoyable, there is very little synergy between characters, and it leaves you to visualize a bland series of attacks and abilities being randomly used on the map.Another neat addition to the game is the use of ""weapon shards"", which is just another item the player can equip to his or her character--and these shards will add a buff to you and/or your party members, but also offer a debuff.  For example, the Vampire weapon shard gives you the ability to lifesteal on hit against most enemies you will face, with the drawback of making health orbs (health pickups) less effective.However, these weapon shards, as well as all of the other voices, in Sacred 3, leave most normal people wanting to pull out their hair and throw on music in the background to drown out the INCREDIBLY annoying dialogue.  You are led and directed by a female named Aria, who helps you constantly on your journey--and you often wish she doesn't--as she jokes about every area and situation your party goes into.  Your weapon shards talk back to you, and after every single fight and combo you go through, you are battered with really terrible one-liners by a mage that consistently hits on you, or a vampire that has a ""drinking"" problem (funny, right?  not when you hear it 100 times...in one level), or a dragon that is scared of everything and literally SCREAMS in fear after every fight.While the graphics are extremely beautiful, and the combat can be fun at most times--especially on crazy boss battles--it does NOT make up for the features taken out from the legendary Sacred 1 and 2 games...features that, according to the developers, ""made the game worse"", which is a sorry excuse for laziness and flat-out burglarly using generic propaganda with the word ""Sacred"" in their game title.If you are expecting Sacred 3 to be a part of the Sacred games you loved so dearly, then STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.  It is NOT that game, unfortunately.  If you go into the game with an open mind, like I did, after reading awful previews and reviews saying this exactly, it can be fun for some hours--and then you can write a disgruntled review like I am, expressing the sadness and anger of being conned by the developers and wishing you had done a little more research before purchasing.In short, Steam asked me if I recommend this game--Yes or No.  They did not give me a **** NO option, so a simple ""No"" will have to suffice.  Stay away."

Even if you don't care about those earlier titles. It's has nothing to do with the gameplay and as such I won't change my review. But Deep Silver (who the devs lost the franchise to) is now on my blacklist for being real life vilains.I enjoy this game, had it a different title to ease minds and a 20$ price tag I'd recommend it as is.Yes the levels are really linear but I wouldn't call them boring, they challenge you in a variety of ways that will have you adapt your gameplay. The options you get aren't that limited as many make it sounds. The cut-scenes are well-polished, the dialogues are funny, I like the different characters (heroes and vilains alike) and they are supported by a more-than-decent voice acting.About the franchise: I don't care much. I played the 1st and 2nd titles as time wasters while waiting for game able to outshine D2 (or at least come close). You probably know that already by now (everyone seems to be mad about it), Sacred 3 is a very different game. But it has nothing to do with the fact I do not recommend it. However, if it bothers you, well, that's another reason why you should stay away from it.To me the root of the problem is that it wasn't meant to be played on PC, it's a really poor port of what seem to be a good console game. From the settings to the controls it really doesn't fit (yet). Some examples:- It's easy to lose sight of your cursor and on high difficulty it often means insta death. It wouldn't have been hard to design one that is easier to spot.- Pressing space to dodge (if you still use dodge that is, you should get block) will have your character rolling toward your cursor even if you were moving in the opposite direction. It's very unintuitive. That also could easily be fixed.- Limited options due to the initial target (console).- Zero way to use the keyboard to chat, you'll have to use the in game voice over IP that everyone mutes so it won't be much use. Unless you playing with friends using skype, TS, ... you won't be able to say anything to your ""co-op"" partners.On that last note, I wouldn't call it a co-op game. Multiplayer? Check. PvE? Check. Cooperation? Very little. It doesn't mean it's not fun to play with others, but you do not need to cooperate.TL;DR: Different from Sacred 1 & 2. Good casual arcade time waster that can even be a bit challenging at times. Poor PC adaptation. Way too expensive for what it is."

The storyline seems almost non-existant and most of the time when there is story you just wish the people would shut up so that you can deal with the inevitable threat that is showing up while your character is in it's cutscene talking.  The graphics are nice I guess, but for how much space the game takes I honestly expected better.  My advice would be to a game like Guantlet.

There is no loot system, and the skill system from 1 and 2 is gone. The skill/equipment system it does have has some promise, it reminds me of the skill talent system from Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer.

What I personally liked about the game was the various characters you could play as (base game- 4 and all DLC- 6), which I greatly enjoyed. It is also within these characters you can play different playstyles (some are the same as others though). It is also a good game to play with firends as it is clearly made for it given some of the mechanics. However, this game has some glaring flaws. First, this game has very little in common with previous Sacred games as other reviews will tell you. Secondly, this game is very simple. Almost every level is ""watch out for falling rocks"" or ""turn the wheel six times."" The final big point I will state is the dialogue. This tries to be funny but will fall short and become annoying. In fact, the bosses even have jokes in their intro, clearly mimicing Borderlands. It also felt like every 20 seconds Aria, your telepathic companion, pesters you about not doing the objective, even though you are currently swamped by enemies. Overall, I would recommend doing what I did. Just get this game on sale ( I got it for $4) with all the DLC and grab a copy for your buddy. It will at least be a fun few hours."

I promised myself that I would never buy a game again without waiting for reviews.But I was fooled again, blinded by the pre-order bonuses of Sacred 3, and the fond memories I had of S1 & S2.S3 is pretty, but that's it. The controls are clearly made for a console. On PC, you move your character with WASD, and you have only 4 attacks/skills (2 on mouse, keys 1 and 2). You evade with space, but have no control on it's direction. Lot's of destructible elements, but you'll often have to strike 3 times before one of your swings actually hit what's right in front of you. All of that make for clumsy control of your character on PC.Don't expect much of character personnalisation, either. There is no cosmetic or gender choices to make, and only 8 skills per class.There's also a ever-present comedic routine, fun for the first 10 minutes, but it gets old very fast.But the one thing I can't forgive, is that there's no loot. Sacred 3 is a Hack&Slash without loot.Imagine Diablo 3 without items, choice of weapons, dumbed down controls and with only a handful of skills. Would you like to play it?TL,DR: Never, ever buy a game right when it's release, and Sacred 3 is a fraud for using the Sacred licence."

Although I'll admit that I haven't had much experience playing the other games, so i am taking this game as a stand alone, but as far as I can tell, this isn't really a traditional RPG. It's more like a Gauntlet Legacy kind of game. You choose stages, you run through and kill enemies, get health and energy as you progress to survive and use skills and then eventually you level up.It's not a bad game on it's own. I really very much enjoy this. I am just getting my girlfriend into gaming and she is playing this game side-by-side with me and it's pretty fantastic. The controls are very smooth, the skills are very useful and simple to understand and the Level Up system works decent for the type of game it is. You get items you can use and those stock can increase as you do certain stages. You can purchase more of those useable items after using them in stages so you'll never really run out. I am playing on the 3 star mode, which is the hardest I can get at the moment and even still the game isn't too hard.Don't know if that's bad or good but as a stand alone game that really shouldn't be expected to play at all like the previous titles, I have to say that this is a VERY fun game. I was expecting it to be crap since it got so many overwhelming negative reviews but it's a great game and I am having a wonderful time playing it. The story is a little lack and the added humor seems a bit forced at atime but it's not totally a bad thing. Kinda eases up the player through the tough levels.So, overall, I'd have to rate this game 8/10 for what it is. It's not the best of the best, but I think it's a bit better than the previous Gauntlet title that came out. Just think of it that way. Instead of being a direct sequel to the other games in terms of gameplay, think of it as a different version of the world and the type of battle system you can get through a Gauntlet-esque type atmosphere.It's fun, good graphics, smooth gameplay, not much else to say. I totally recommend this game as a STAND ALONE to the other 2 titles. :)EDIT: I did play with an Xbox One Controller, so that is a whole lot smoother than the keyboard controls. I really didn't like the keyboard controls, especially how you aim with the mouse. Very frustrating, so I just used a controller."

Just calling it ""Sacred: Uprising"" or something would rise the reviews up to 70%'s.Before I bought the game I read the reviews, I played the original Sacred and loved it. But I bought the game anyway because it seemed like a good couch co op to play with my family. And this is what this game is all about, a co op action rpg.Keyboard/mouse controls are not that bad, but turning animation is non-existant. I recommend playing it with a x360 controller. Keyboard/mouse + x360 co op is working thankfully.Graphics are really good actually. A little bit too bright from time to time but really good visuals. Aside from non-existant keyboard turn animation, all other effects and animations are very well made. There are so many different backgrounds to fight on, I wonder if they intended to make a instance based a-rpg when they started.Music and voice acting are also good. Not too great though, dialogues almost always sarcastic, most of the time it will make you smile but sometimes it gets too corny.Story is not all that great, I only got upset a bit when *spoiler alert* our narrator got captured and we had to rescue her.Gameplay mechanics; everything works fine, abilities and heroes compliment each other, balance is good. Weapon spirit mechanic is creative and fun. Your weapon spirits will make voiced commets while you play and it can be really funny. There are many different types of minions but types of mini bosses are only two. Actually there are some more but differences aren't noticable. Fighting big bosses can be really fun or sometimes really frustrating. Co op mechanics exists like one player turns a wheel wile other tries to fend off minions. They made really polished create opening animations but they only drop health/energy orbs and gold. Weapons, armor and weapon spirits are upgraded at certain hero levels.Weapon spirit drops are even worse. They drop randomly and cover half the screen when they do. There are items which drop at side quests such as potions and wards, I with other items droped like that as well.Conclusion; I'm going to give this game a thumbs up, it frusturated me from time to time, it wasn't what I expected from Sacred but I had fun with my family and this game looks, sounds and plays too polished to get a negative from me. I didn't let my past experiance ruin this game for me. If you have one or two controllers and a friend to play with, this game is a good co-op experience."

I finally installed it hoping that it might have some sort of semblance to the game that I had played a number of years ago... I suppose that idea was dashed within moments of starting the game.  Instead of a semi-open world it has been changed into a series of select a location, fight through the enemy lines, rinse and repeat.  There is no replayability as you just do the same thing over and over and over again through the course of the game, finish an area, get an award screen and maybe a level up, start the next scene, get an uninspiring introduction voice over.  There is no longer a loot system, just pick up gold that you use to unlock new inventory items that are gained through level unlock... if the boss is too hard, just go back a section and grind it a few times...

It's a beat-em-up brawler similar to Gauntlet just better, although that's probably a matter of taste. The only thing this game is not is Sacred.I am not aware of any other game on Steam that received as many negative ratings as Sacred 3 has. The reason for this are unfulfilled expectations. That's because Sacred 3 has nothing to do with Sacred 1 or Sacred 2. The game is neither an open-world game nor a role-playing game and the only thing Sacred 1 and Sacred 2 share with Sacred 3 is the name. If you can accept that and you like hack and slay games Sacred 3 is a very enjoyable game.Pros:- nice graphics, beautiful landscapes- character specific weapons, armor, special attacks- weapon upgrades- armor upgrades- special attacks (upgradeable)- 15 diversified levels in the main game- good DLCs- good music- co-op- multi-player, lobbies are currently full (October 2015)- co-op in combination with multi-player (two co-op, two mp)- you only collect gold (which keeps you from searching for scrolls and any other hidden stuff)- very easy to join games- you can join or leave games at any time- four difficulty levels (last difficulty is accessible after first play-through)Cons:- it's not Sacred- leveling up can get tiresome. Once you reached level 30 it takes a lot of time and fighting to collect the necessary experience points to level up further.There are dissent opinions about the dialogs in the game. Please take into considerations that the game supports different languages with different translations and speakers.During your journey you are accompanied by Aria, a telepathic, informing you about upcoming events, enemies dangers, areas, etc. She keeps talking all the time and at least in German her voice acting is great. Then you can select a god that inhabits your weapon, providing some special abilities. The selected god keeps talking too. The gods talking strongly reflect their diverse personalities and they tend to exaggerate.Dialogs are often childish with a strong use of youth slang. They tend to not take the game seriously and are very grotesque. It's the grotesqueness that makes the dialogs funny again, provided you have the right sense of humor.I like them, especially Aria is great in German."

If you liked the previous games, don't get this.Stages are linnear with some hidden treasure and tons of enemies to kill. Choose one of 5(6) characters to fight the enemies, each chracter can assign two skills besides the light and heavy attacks. You can also choose between skills and different weapons. Earn money to upgrade skills and weapons to improve your fighter in differernt ways. You also have to make some gamechanging choices on whether you want to use Block or Dodge roll.The writing and script is rather terrible though, it makes Trine 2 seem serious.Strange relations: Dungeon siege 3, combat is pretty simmilar with limited skills. Although DS is a lot more open and has loot. Drakengard 3 with the pretty similar gameplay of simplistic battle system and linear stages ended with bosses. Heavenly Sword, with the combat system where you are expected to break guards and fight different kinds of enemies in different ways. Also, the villains kinda remind of each other. Old Action hack and slashes like Excalibur or any Warriors game.

I would even go so far to say that this PC port felt more like an afterthought.Game complexity: I am not against grinding as a game mechanic, because there can be good grinding games where you're constantly on your toes, and then there's bad ones. Sacred 3 falls under the latter - I fell asleep while clearing mobs because there's virtually no challenge - press button, monster dies. HP/Mana management? Choosing the right equipment for the right fights? Fret not, you are released from that burden in this game. </s>Replayability: The only reason to try out other characters is to see their skills.

,Recommended,247950,32247912,Posted: 7 June,all,Vindred,"Tee-El Dee-ar, Adun:  While this game may not be a propersequel, it is quite a good videogame for people who like the genre, and I would call this one a Twin-Stick Hack-and-Slash.  Most of the negativity toward it is becausepeople expected something else.  It also has a nearly Dad Joke sense of humor about it, so if you are annoyed by intentionally silly/troll-y humor, steer clear.Just to be sure you're under no illusions, this game isnotan ARPG like Diablo.  It is a twin-stick.  You select a character,  you select a mission, you hack, you slash, you beat the baddie at the end, you move to the next mission.  There are no trips to town--there is no town.  The hub is the map screen where you select missions and your character loadout.  There's no wandering around, because there's nowhere to wander because the missions themselves are very much on-rails. There's also no standing around deciding which items to pick up after you kill a big group, because there's no Diablo-style inventory to manage.  Thereareitems to collect, but these are just progression unlocks which you can pick and choose before the mission.I've noticed people compare this game to Gauntlet, but lacking experience with that game, I can only say it controls likeAlien Swarm: Reactive Dropwith only minor differences.If you've never played a twin stick, (do try AS:RD, linked above, as it is excellent and free) they are actually designed for a controller with a stick on the left that you move with and a stick on the right which you aim attacks with.  For we keyboardists, you move your character with WASD and determine which direction you aim with the mouse.  I will be referencing the keyboard/mouse controls since that's what I use.This game has one control oddity in that it determinesthe direction you dodge when you push the dodge keywith your mouse position, whereas in the other twin sticks I've played (again,Alien Swarm: Reactive Dropand alsoLivelock), you dodge in the direction of yourmovement.  This means that inthose games, you can aim at a target while simultaneously dodging away from it while using a keyboard.  But in Sanctum 3, you first have to move your mouse cursor to a position opposite the opponent you're dodging away from, and then return the cursor to the enemy's direction once you complete the dodge in order to aim at them again.  However, it also means that you havefiner controlover which direction you dodge, since with WASD you can only move in the eight cardinal directions.Each of the game's four classes (six with DLCs) has a basic attack on left click, a ""Bash"" on the right, two special abilities on number keys 1 and 2 (light and heavy respectively), and using a potion defaulted to mouse wheel click, while selecting a potion was bound to mouse wheel roll.  Your left click is your general purpose Kill-It, your right click bash is for enemies with shield icons over their heads, indicating a strong defense.   Using your Bash on these enemies will temporarily stun them, allowing you to chop/slice/stab/perforate them up with your left click.  There are also traps in the game which are reliably disabled with the ""Bash"".  The special skills vary between the classes, but all seem to be limited-use-but-refillable group attacks of varying effectiveness.  One mechanic which is unique among my twin sticks is the ability to pick up mid-sized enemies and hurl them at other enemies.  This seems mostly for flourish, since there are other effective ways to kill enemies, but it is amusing and effective enough in its own right.  Edit: After testing this further, I can say throwing is actually QUITE effective, handily bowling over a dozen other combatants with a single throw.You can modify your character's equipment and skill loadouts between missions.  All the characters have at least three or four options of special attacks to slot into their 1 and 2 keys, and armor and weapons can also be selected to affect appearance/minor stat changes.  There is also an equippable type of....item?called a ""Battle Spirit"".  These, when applied to your weapon, give bonuses.   For example, the first one you get, the ""Battlemage"", applies a change to chain lightning between enemies when you attack.   He also sometimes says stuff like, ""OH BABY!""  That's a good example to see if the game's sense of humor will bother you, actually.  Does it bother you that sometimes your weapon will scream ""Oh baby!"" at you?The story is a serious story told in a not-serious-at-all way.   This isn't to say that it is poorly-executed-- the voice acting is above-average for videogames, and it all makes sense.   It's just quite silly in places.Overall, I am having an unexpectedly fun time in my first-everOverwhelmingly Negative-rated game, and I think if you give it a chance, you might as well!"

If you are looking for a massive open game like Sacred 2, this isn't it. This is litterally nothing like Sacred 2, except the fact that you only get to pick a few characters and no real customization.They took a whole new approach, and tried to tap into the more action combat gameplay. Although this game does that quite well, it is just like many other games of its kind, but less imaginative. Graphics are pretty decent and action combat is alright.Sacred 2 voice overs were actually pretty decent, but Sacred 3's is absolute terrible. They tried to half heartedly make the game funny, which turned into pathetic. The best voice over would be the first battle spirit you come across. He is quick witted, funny, and enjoyable to listen to. Problem was that the game made very little indication as to who was actually talking. Pretty much I had no idea it wasn't the character I was playing as talking for a bit.Gameplay is average at best, boring as heck at worst. Every single mission basically plays out the same. Waves of bad guys with varying abilities you HAVE to use to even kill them. Bosses with all the same basic skills, then repeat. Pretty simple really, if they have a shield above their head, you have to knock it away. Otherwise you just keep moving and killing. Like Dynasty Warriors, but not as cool.The absolute worst part of the game, is the variety. Every single hero plays exactly the same. Sure you can pick two skills, but most of the skills are about the same. Some are a complete waste to even pick, which lowers the variety even more. You can pick your weapon, but they are very similar so it won't even matter much.For the price tag, I would say this game is totally not worth it.

Would have to state that it babies the player a bit even on ***, and the the voice acting is a bit purile; That may or may not be an issue. So far it plays 4 out of 5 stars for a Sacred game, and 3 out 5 for games in this genra. Worth the $4.99 it's on sale for right now and the pack for $12.99 makes perfect sense if you liked Sacred 2 but don't have it. For some reason I felt like was back in the 80's watching Heman."

Disappointed much?When getting this during a sale, and approaching it without overblown expectations, this is quite a decent game - not great, but not as bad as some reviews indicate it to be.If you like fast-paced button smashers/monster bashers, and look at a few hours of simple, relaxing gameplay, this is an OK game in the vein of Gauntlet and similar (Dungeon Siege without loot), with some decent graphics. Don't expect much RPG content, though.Most boss fights are doable (some quite hard, though - especially the Dark Seraphim), and tbh I found the worst part (except for the Dark Seraphim) to a map with the spike traps around Level 20, where you start pretty far back when you die.Replayability, though, is so/so at best.Worst game ever, as some reviewers have stated? Not by a long long distance - there are literally hundreds of games worse than this."

So if that is what you are looking for, move on.If you ignore the history and just evaluate the game itself, it is a solid Hack'n'Slash. It is more an advanced version of Gauntlet than a dumbed down ARPG (the point of view all the disappointed S2 fans take).If you want an ARPG, this is not the game for you, limited skill selection and no loot make this a no-go. If you want more of a brawler, go for it, combat is good enough imo, areas are nice but very linear. You collect some money per mission and can upgrade skills with it.Notice that the controls are better for a controller, so if you use keyboard and mouse and do not like WASD movement, do not get the game either (WASD works, controller is better).You also will have to overlook the stupid attempt at humor this game has in really all narration and that you unfortunately cannot turn off.If you can look past that, want a Hack'n'Slash, not an ARPG, and are ok with WASD (or better yet with using a controller), it is a solid game. Not outstanding, but also not deserving all the bad ratings from the disappointed S2 fans that are predominantly upset about this not being a true successor."

More classes can be bought as DLC. This is not an open world game, you will be running down narrow corridors most of the time, but that kinda comes with the genre. There is no loot to speak of (only gold + health and mana orbs), instead you unlock new items and skills by leveling up or beating bosses. You can upgrade your stuff by paying gold.

It is pretty linear. You kill, do missions, level up and upgrade and get stronger. Don't go into this game thinking it is an extension of Sacred 1 and 2. Thsi is kind of in the theme of it but all its own. The main thing that bothered me about the game is using a K/M. It wasn't bad and most people may get used to it but I need fluid mechanics. I am used to doing everything about steering and targeting with my keys but your avatar attacks in the direction of your mouse pointer so that was throwing my brain off a little and making it harder to play. As time went on I was getting used to it but it was still kind of annoying me. That being said, if you can use a game controller this game would probably play very well with one as you wouldn't have to worry about the WSAD and pointer issue. Although I did not try the controller so I am just assuming that you wouldn't have the steering pointer problem with a controller. Overall, the game played well but felt a little generic. You still have the same Ancarian humor. One line joking. I was playing the game in 4k so it looked very nice. My video below will show you some basic gameplay from a nooby who doesn't play these types of game much anymore.

It's not an RPG with an open world where you can run around and complete quests. This is what many people expected and why so many are disappointed. Sacred 3 is an extremely linear Hack'n Slash game with lots of action and (in my opinion) nice graphics. It takes place in Ancaria. That's pretty much all it has in common with its predecessors.Nevertheless, it is a decent game. The visuals are well done, controls are intuitive (if you play with a controller) and accurate. You constantly need various buttons which are much easier to reach on a controller than a keyboard. Further, the game has a online as well as a local co-op mode. Playing with others is much more fun and something I would definitely recommend to do.The only thing I found annoying after a while are the comments of your companions. I guess, the developers aimed at being funny. They are not. I prefer a more serious tone in the dialogues while I'm saving the world. It's not the right time to hear about wannabe romantic approaches of whatever kind of ghost I'm carrying around with me.TL, DR: This is a good game with some minor flaws.

Good.This isn't Sacred.The closest existing Sacred game is Sacred Citadel.  But that doesn't make this game bad.  Remember those good old days you spent during your youth? Pumping quarters into a game called Guantlet?  Yeah, this is that, except conveniently located on your home PC/Console, where you can love it forever.Despite others calling it a ""mindless button-masher"", there is a bit of thought involved when combating a massive wad of enemies.  You have standard attack, ""Bash"" (shield breaker), dodge/block, throw/power attack (used on boss type critters to deal a decent chunk of damage), a Light and Heavy Combat Art that use energy, and an Execution to 1-hit knocked down enemies.  Trust me, nothing feels quite like knocking down a group of enemies and then hopping from one to the next with murderous force.Main levels generally consist of moving from arena to arena, mashing through waves of enemies until the barrier disapates, or you get a key drop from some sub-boss, or you clear X number of waves.  But since you enjoyed Gauntlet back in the day, that's not a problem, right?  The only ""loot"" is gold, which you use to upgrade your character between levels, unlocking boosts to combat arts, weapons, and other things, as well as buying potions and the like.Is this Sacred 2++ (thats ""2 incremented by 1"" for you non programming oriented people)? No.Is it fun? Sure, why not?Ignore the fact that it has Sacred in the title, embrace the fact that it is an ""arcade hack and slash"" (as it says in the description, for those of you complaining about it being exactly that), round up some friends, and bludgeon some goblins or whatever they are to a bloody pulp for fun and profit.PS: You really want a controller if you're on PC, cause it may or may not destroy your keyboard.  And it was designed for controllers, so the keyboard controls are probably awkward."

Personally I do not believe it should be called Sacred 3 as it is not part of the Sacred theme and story. However if you like hack n slash games then this is for you.

If you like hack and slash games that are similar to Gauntlet with a little bit more polish and some rpg elements (skill / weapon leveling etc.) this game is for you.Most people assumed that this was going to be Sacred 1/2, Diablo 1/2/3 rehash #9000 but it is not. It is hack and slash game straight up. You kill monsters, get gold, level up characters, skills and all the normal stuff. There is no loot and to me it is a good thing. There are already too many games making monsters / chests drop tons of worthless loot. I would rather have this, get fun skills for the different characters and go blow up tons of monsters.Go watch some un-biased videos and reviews to make an ultimate decision on this game. Do not just pass it up because its the Sacred name rebranded with a 3 and not like the first two. People who loved the first 2 games need to take their nostalgia goggles off and look at this game for what it is....a fun hack and slash where you just collect gold and kill tons of monsters."

If you want this game for the Sacred franchise playstyle, don't buy it. Just going into it though, it's a pretty fun hack and slash. There's no loot, but you can change your characters playstyle a bit. It's more of a loadout at the beginning of a level kind of thing. All in all, other than a Sacred name slapped on it, this game is enjoyable... for short stints. Not a huge timesink like an ARPG. Just a hack n' slash."

I saw in gameplay videos it looked more like a Diablo 3-ish sytle but even that has been dulled down to a basic hack&slash with no real reward for it. The game is enjoyable but all the reasons I pre ordered it are not there and to me is a great let down. Good example of developers believing better graphics surely make a better game but really a weak combat system and dulled variety of gear and powers. I'm fine with the limited character selection and even the limited move set but the game is nothing like it was hyped to be or what the previous entries were like. The game itself is not bad but you can't play it in respects to the other titles in this series. I recommend it only if you don't mind limited level sizes and a very linear story line

Though, discounting this game simply because of experiences with with the prior titles would cause you to miss out on a world of fun. While it lacks the deep story and customization of Sacred and Sacred 2, the new combat system is a blast to use. The story, so far anyway, is lackluster and disinteresting, but that's not what this game is about.For those of you who have gotten this far, you'll like this game if you're a fan of games like Dynasty Warriors as, ironically, that's what this game feels like. In my opinion, if Sacred made a baby with the Warriors games, this is what I'd expect it to look like. Given that, I'm not surprised by the lack of story or deep customization because the intense combat is the focus. In the future, I personally hope that this combat system is kept and the old system of loot and quests brought back. I really believe that this is a step forward for the combat of the ARP genre.If you can just look past the Sacred title and the history of the series, I think most will enjoy this game. Worst comes to worst, wait for a sale, but I do not suggest those interested in the ARP genre should pass it up."

Good, there are enough point & click ARPGs out there, and the previous Sacreds weren't all that, anyway.The system req's should also definitely include controller(s) and a buddy. This game is made for couch co-op; there are a number of game mechanics that don't even function when playing solo.Onto the gameplay: I found this an absolute blast. The different characters give a satisfyingly different game experience - there's the slow, hard-hitting tank, the archer / crowd-controller, and the fast-but-squishy skirmisher who excells at taking out high-value targets. Then a quite powerful hybrid who can do a bit of everything, and the pre-order bonus char, who seems a bit OP at the start but falls in line after a few levels and most resembles the skirmish character.Combat is the main focus of this game; there's a normal melee attack that can be chained into a combo, a disabling bash that deals little damage but is absolutely crucial against certain enemies, and two 'combat arts' that require energy, which is regenerated by your regular attacks (the main similarity to previous Sacred games). Then there's a defensive move and a co-op-only battle prayer. I find it fast and fun, but I imagine it would be hell with a keyboard/mouse set-up. It is definitely not just a button masher, there are plenty of situations where chosing the wrong sort of attack spells certain doom, or at least a facefull of sword.The game plays through individual missions, in between which you are returned to a 'lobby'. No open-world exploration. You can replay missions as often as you like, which lets you fine-tune the difficulty a bit by levelling up in easier areas if you're finding a particular mission too tough. Some of them are quite tough, you cannot simply face-roll everything in this game.Levelling and looting is 'streamlined' by buying upgrades for gold, which is disappointing if that's not what you're after, but you still get to make meaningful choices in character builds. For example, some weapons emphasize attack area, some damage, and some special effects like knockdown or lifedrain. At some point, you will have to decide if you prefer to defend by blocking or dodging. You can experiment with everything, as the most recent upgrade in each skill line is a free buy-back, but you will not likely be able to afford to just max everything. You get to pick a new load-out before each mission.All gear and abilities level up with your char, which means armour and weapons look progressively more bad♥♥♥♥♥ but this is mostly cosmetic.The other major customisation is the choice of 'weapon-spirit': these come with a more or less powerful bonus, and a corresponding flaw; for example, the vampire lets your melee attacks drain life, but reduces your health recovery from health drops. They also frequently pipe up during the game...So, to the superficials: Graphics are uniformly gorgeous for this kind of game, with lots of detail even in the non-gaming areas. The sound-track is also suitably epic. The (English) voice-acting is excellent, and there is an awful lot of it, but what the voices have to say is... not for everyone. There's a lot of goofy, inoffensive humour, like what we'd get at the gaming table after a few beers. Some of it falls flat, some of it makes me smile (I love the drunk vampire weapon spirit). The use of accents, on the other hand, just comes off as a bit racist - not acceptable and so unnecessary.It's not a perfect game, and better suited to an hour or so of fun hack-and-slash than to day-long immersive play, but it definitely does not deserve the hate flung at it... If you liked Champions of Norrath, Untold Legends or even the fighty bits of Kindoms of Amalur, this might push your buttons; and though this is not a ringing endorsement, it is miles better than Dungeon Siege 3"

Also I would say that the character's abilities are different enough that you would want to try each of them to see what best fits your play style.As for the name of the game Sacred 3, many people are getting stuck on this.  Yes I've played and have beaten both Sacred 1 and 2.  aid if you are expecting to find a game like that,  then unfortunatly you will be sadly disappointed.  and like many have said, perhaps giving this game another name would have most likely been a better option.  About the only thing that this game holds true to the sacred name is some of the characters and of course the setting of the game itself.Pros for the game:- Good graphics- Drop in/drop out multiplayer.- the player level advancement is well paced as you move through the levels- varied boss and monster mechanics- Unique enough playable characters that you would want to try all of themCons for the game:- It's sacred in name and name only this is for the most part a top down hack 'n slash- Character development is extremely limited you can only unlock/upgrade skills by reaching certain levels- Finding upgrades is linked to specific levels in the game- Game really isn't mouse/keyboard friendly, was definitly designed with consoles in mindOver all.  the game is a nice nice distraction for awhile and also a good addition to the Sacred Universe of games but has been preveriously stated, this game really doesn't desver the title of Sacred 3 and in face this type of game could possibly spawn it's own series within the sacred universe and would have honestly been a better idea."

It is not an open world RPG with hundreds of different weapons and armors, the number of skills and things you can level up on your own is also limited.So if you were looking for the old Sacred experience this is the point where you would like to leave.Now let us get to the part where we talk about what the game is.* It is hack'n'slay!* It is kind of like a sidescroller* It has 100s of mobs swarming around you waiting to be killed* It is a mission based gameSo who would actually enjoy that kind of game? Well if you are the type who both enjoys the Devil May Cry series as well as Diablo then it might be the solid mix between the two that you MIGHT enjoy, especially when playing with friends.While i do enjoy it so far it is not what i expected but i remain neutral about it. As far as the price goes, if you have a lot of money to spend then sure why wouldn't you wanna buy the game if you are the type of person that would like it? However the game is not worth it's price and it is the only point that makes me sad  about it so far.It's ok to go in a different way. It is ok to try something new. It is refreshing. In some way.Now it's up to you to pick a side.Will you leave having been looking for the old Sacred experience? Or will you appreciate the work that has been put into this game?I am a gamer and so i say that every game has one aspect or the other that one can enjoy if the game is actually really really bad which Sacred 3 is not.Edit: Final thoughts:The game is not what Sacred used to be so the title Sacred 3 is missleading. Just a different project name would have saved the game from a lot of negative reaction. The game itself is not bad... Just overpriced... And different...And here some ""TL;DRs""Player Case 1 (Old Schooler):You are looking for the old Sacred experience? It is not here. Might as well leave.Player Case 2 (Open Minded yet a bit poor):You still DO want the game but you do not have too much money to spend? I suggest waiting until a big sale bring it down by at LEAST 50% then it is worth the price.Case 3 (Open Minded... With money):You have the money and you like the direction of the game despite the developers having moved away from what this game is? Take it.Oh i also appreciate the developers having tried to introduce humor in the dialogues"

Not really a game for serious and dedicated gamer. but if you are looking for a fun game for time killing then this is the game...if it is labelled as a free to play , thats it. the price just doesnt worth the content in the game."

You're better off getting those series and Sacred 1 & 2. Wish Ascaron still had the rights for this game, they would've done it right."

I knew the game was just an arcade brawler before buying. I like arcade brawlers, after all.But this game isn't fun. There's no challenge, the controls are mediocre, and the story... Oh man, that was almost as cringeworthy as the horribly cheesy voice acting. I tried to have fun with it, but couldn't.This is one of the worst games I've ever played. :("
