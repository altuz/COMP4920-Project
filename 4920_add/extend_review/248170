Under ""About This Software"" on Steam we're give examples of games that have been made with this software and promises that we'll make our first game in under an hour. I couldn't find any real information about using this to distribute my own game. Even on their website I struggle to find any legal information. Only after going to their own store did I finally find this: ""Note: Commercial games and apps created with the standard version of Fusion 2.5 must include a ""Created with Fusion"" logo. The Developer version does not require the inclusion of our logo.""So be warned, this is not $100. It's $100 for the base package, $300 so you don't have to plaster their logo on your product, and ~$70 per device that you want to export to. I'm extremely bitter at the fact that they hide the legal limitations of the base software and instead plaster the ""About This Software"" section with ""LOOK AT ALL THESE COOL GAMES PEOPLE MADE WITH CLICKTEAM FUSION!"" I would not recommend it for that fact alone."

I mean there must be huge down sides to a game engine that is drag and drop, right?Wrong, its fantastic. My heart will always lie with programming your own games, but THIS is amazing for making smaller 2d games, even prototyping ideas with rapid iteration time.You literallty game make a whole game in an hour with this :)Im sure it has limitations, but none i have found yet :)//**** edit ****I found some issues:- The standard version (not developer) when used with the Android exporter has some limitations, mainly to do with monetization.- To use Google Admob advertising you HAVE to have the developer version (this is not clear on the product comparison page on their website)- You CANNOT provide ANY in app purchase functiionality without the developer version.I have seen other people ask how to use admob only to be told they need the dev version. Its just not clear enough when buying the Standard edition that those things arent included.The comparison between versions is ONLY available on the Developer version page. It should be on the standard page as well, because the people buying standard need to know what they are NOT getting, just as much as the people buying the developer edition need to know what they ARE getting."

Reviewing the comments on this thread may help you decide whether or not to purchase the product.  I'm still not satisfied that the product is on track from the customer standpoint.This product itself is OK.  It does help to simplify how you build games/apps.  It could even be great someday, because it's structured well and it does allow for some complex functions within said games/apps.The problem is, the support is horrendous and I'm doubting the product will ever get to where it could get to.  I've waited over 5 months simply to get access to bug reports and have received rude/useless responses from their technical support group.  With support like that, this software will simply die.Need further proof?  Check the HTML5 exporter, which has had the same caveat related to IE11 on it for 5 months."

Overall, the software still remained true to its root as a tool to help non-technical people make games, so I'll recommend it to those who lack the technical skills to make a game but still very much want to do it, or to veteran devs who felt the need to go easy a little while and do drag 'n drops."

For example, if the idea of using an array to store data or creating an iteration to perform a function on objects based on conditions are alien concepts, you might want to learn some coding to prime yourself.There is a fair amount of documentation in the built-in help system, but it's a little light on usage examples. Luckily there's a few really good youtube channels with walkthroughs.The built in physics engine is pretty mindblowing, goes as far as detecting collision on a per-pixel level!Overall, excellent budget-level tool for 2d mobile app development - in the right hands, it's capable of churning out some cracking results.I haven't seen or used anything as scalable for the same price tag.Protip: There is no AdMob support for android publishing in the Standard edition, so if you're thinking of using AdMob in your apps, you'll have to go for the Developer edition which is a bit more expensive - wasn't clear on this before purchase but considering Dev edition upgrade anyway so not feeling too sore :)."

There are other tools that are similar. However, the functionality of CF2.5 got me. There are great extensions to ease the process (not all of them work on every exporter).You just have to understand basic stuff on how CF works. When you got that (condition to be met so the event can activate, top-down reading run time -like batch process), you'll be creating funny 2D games to share.I've found the community is active and nice. We help each other and keep learning in the process. There are good tutorial videos (Snail has a lot), and also tons of examples to look at the code in action.The downside of how CF2.5 works is that there is no code reusability.. but heck! I don't know how to code either, so I'll just click on the functions and have the tool do magic for me.I would say CF2.5 is the best tool for me, someone who doesn't know how to code and enjoys planning the game mechanics (other than fighting with the syntaxis).

Everything is almost done with the mouse, but what ever you think of, you can pretty much build with this software, you just have to take a bit of time thinking out the logic to get things to work in the way you want, also having good Maths knowledge is a massive help (but that applies to most programming languages).  There are loads of extension tools available to enhance features.  I haven't really used Fusion before, but what I have seen and used so far is great.  The developers are very supportive too.If i'm honest, I don't think this is a tool you could use to create something in an hour or so in the hope of making a living from it, but spend the time and dedication and...well there are examples of games already made with it and they are great in my opinion.Would I recommend this...absolutely."

This software is a great place to start if you're new to developing games, it's so easy to use.. it may look confusing at the start but if they provide you some useful tutorials to help you out when using the software.Clickteam is an awesome community for support, It's a bit confusing finding the area to make a thread for support but it only takes around a day or even in some cases an hour for someone to reply with a solution.You'd also think that with a software so easy to use it would be pretty limited, there are some slight limitations but they're pretty small and unnoticable. (Atleast for me)This software is easy to use in the sense that there's hardly any proper coding, it's basically all drag and drop.. you hardlyneed to ever use the keyboard for coding... infact I've never noticed ever having to use the keyboard I just prefer to.There is a slight limitation in the Standard version of Fusion which happens to be that you have to use their logo somewhere in your game though so keep that in mind if you're buying the Standard Version.All in all I rate the software 9/10 (So far) It's an awesome software to start using if you're new to creating games."
,Recommended,248170,9674697,"Posted: 30 March, 2014",all,Billo,"It was two months ago when I decided to put a little money into this little engine. Initially, the excitement was palpable. Inside of two hours I had created my first game and started to develop the mechanics towards a full release. That is how easy it is to get started.What comes next however is the understanding of how the engine is put together, how each function, event, flag, object; how they all have individual properties and how to apply global and local events to each respectively. This practice largely came about from trial-and-error. While there are some tutorials around there isn't a concise ""Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced"" starter guide and if purchasing off steam the forums are limited due to the lack of a key (edit - you can now register on forums using steam account, thanks Denilson)This does not detract from the enjoyment and excitement of finding out the sweet spot. The idea that the answers are spoon-fed is not how this game would be made. The formulation of an idea and implementation into the engine and then the fun of testing to trial-and-error is what makes this fun and the engine helps this along. The engine does not prohibit but intices you with new ways of solving the same problem. In turn the ability to quickly formulate new approaches is really where this engine stays strong.I am therefore a Fusioneer. Happy to develop in this engine and invest my time and effort into what will soon hopefully become a succesful first game.Lloyd Hawthornewww.forgedgames.co.uk"

It's easy to use, you can learn fast, however there is a lack of tutorials and you have to really dig around to find them. Fusion is the kind of thing that is learned quickly, but takes thousands of hours to master.The integrated physics is also a great tool, but its not perfect. One of the biggest cons is the animation. In a game with many animations, things get monotonous and down right ridiculous when you have to place thousands of hotspots individually. The clickteam animator can solve this, but I don't like it, especially for complicated animations. I'm not sure what Fusion 3.0 will add, but I will still continue to use the software.

,Recommended,248170,34405018,Posted: 21 August,all,Skurry,"(Based off of a total usage (so far) of 183 hours.)Background in other ""smiliar"" IDE's: Used Game Maker Studio for 4 years before I touched Clickteam Fusion.It's really hard to say which is the better tool, since it really does depend on what kind of game you are building as well as what level of control you think you will need to build said game. Honestly, if you're building any kind of 2D platformer, top down jRPG, top-down ""Zelda"" style adventure game, etc. then Fusion is really all you would need. This is largely due to the sheer number of extremely useful/powerful extension widgets you can add to your project, that do more than adequate work on a number of ""heavy lifting"" aspects of your development. (You don't need to code things like physics, dynamic animation timing/draw engines, programming for DI/XI controller schemes, GUI's, etc. etc. from scratch, since there is an add-on widget for each of these tasks, and they are all very powerful/flexible.) It took me a grand total of 4 days to completely port the plaformer engine I'd built with GM:Studio over the course of some months, into Fusion, and a good bit of that time was just learning the quirks of the Fusion IDE.During the testing of objects and rooms, all events that you create are merely interpreted at runtime, not compiled, though you do get to compile your finished project into an .exe for distribution. The thing about interpretation during testing is that you now need to worry about how your event list for a given object is sequenced, since the list will be interpreted (read) TOP TO BOTTOM, during every frame. It's kind of annoying to have to experiment and arrange things so that they work for TESTING, when it probably won't matter how most stuff is sequenced after the compile. The thing this has over GM: Studio, is that you can now test things MUCH quicker, in piecemeal fashion, without having to compile your entire project every single time you want to test anything you did or changed.Because of the ""spreadsheet"" structure of the IDE, you are no longer able to write code blocks in the traditional sense. This means no real ""if/else"" statements, no real ""swtiching"" statements, etc. There ARE ways to simulate such things within the workspace. One example is dynamically activating/deactivating groups of events as you need/don't need them to run. (Kind of like creating a switching statement, since you can't actually write out a switching statement.) Fusion DOES support the ability to have GLOBAL variables, strings and events, so you don't have to keep copypasting these things from room to room to room. (Example: Player control handling, object variables that need to affect the game world globally, etc.)Importing animations, tilesets, sound, music, etc. is handled much better in Fusion, IMO. You no longer need to code loops, forced frames and the like, since Fusion is intuitive enough where you can do it all by clicking this or that checkbox.Now...objects. (Creature objects for example and in particular.) In Fusion, when placing more than one of the same object in room, you are actually placing DUPLICATES of that object, not multiple INSTANCES of that object. That means they are identical in every single way, right down to their event timing. (I.E, 10 hopper enemies: one hops, they ALL hop at the same time, etc.) There is a ""ForEach"" widget blah blah (UPDATE: There is actually ForEach loop capability built into Clickteam Fusion now, and can be found in the actions menu of any object in your project. Just intialize and run them like you would any fastloop. Testing the potential of these things and what all they can do for you, really does stretch into more ""intermediate"" territory, but after some good experimentation and watching a few tutorials, it's actually pretty easy.)Quirks aside, I really do feel like Fusion might be the better option for absolute beginners, and if you're somewhat experienced already and willing to figure out the quirks, could mean MUCH faster prototyping/building for you. (Not gonna lie, the quirks and getting Fusion do some of the more outside-the-box stuff can be a bit frustrating at first, especially if you're reaching for something that's usually so simple to do with raw code. Once you figure it out though, the QoL perks are pretty massive.)"

After the few tutorials though you are pretty much left in the dark about all the other features and options the software has to offer. The amount of documentation and guides is fairly limited so to really get the hang of it you still will need to do a lot of messing around and figure things out on your own by trial and error. Creating a basic game is very doable, creating an interesting game with more in depth mechanics is an other thing though.The sofware itself gets an 75/100 from me. If there would be more documentation/guides/tutorials it would be 80/100.When you are going to use clickteam you also want to have the benefit of everything the community and the company has to offer on their website. That is the place where I encountered some problems.Eight months ago I went to their website to create an account and saw quickly that the website had not setup any security at all. When you create (and login) an account you have to do that on an unlocked page and they 'mandatory' wants you to fill in all your personal data (they even want your phone number, MANDATORY). If you don't fill in all the data you can't create an account there.I have told the dev on the Steam forum about the security issue and he said that he will forward it. Eight months later the pages on their website are still unlocked and unsecured which gives me a bad feeling about the company. I don't like companies that wants to know everything about you when you create an account, but does not take the privacy and security of their customers seriously.This is pretty much unacceptable in 2016, any company that operates on the internet should have at least some basic security setup and have locks on the sensitive pages to protect the privacy of their customers.... or simply don't ask for so much personal 'mandatory' information on the account registration page if security and a safe account registration is not a priority.It is also not very clear why they want so much personal info from me when I create an account, why do they want my phone number exactly?I really have to give a big thumb down on that aspect and as a result the whole review will get a thumb down... till the time they take the personal data of their customers seriously and have redone the account pages on their website.And pls note that the thumb down is not due to the product/software itself, I am pretty satisified with how the software works."

The tutorial also serves as an introduction to key topics of game development, these key topics are covered in a way as to make the requirement of a University degree unnecessary (such topics include 'the player object', collision detection & event triggers). CF 2.5 is simply an AAA+ software suite that is easy to get started with and in a league of it's own when it comes to video game and general purpose software development.To state an overused phrase 'in this day and age' where the percentage of games developed from scratch is next to nil, it is no longer taboo utilizing such software for video game and general purpose software development (in fact in the developer edition you don't even have to give credit to Click Team for the development of your games & apps). While many alternatives in the form of game engines and engine+SDK hybrids do exist, CF 2.5 is not only the most versatile given it's video game and general purpose software focus it is also the most readily accessible to beginners.To conclude CF 2.5 will be a heavily relied upon and favourite for many first time and estaiblished indie developers.

The $100 price tag doesn't seem worth what you're getting when you can find an open-source JavaScript game engine for free. I feel you're better off reading books and learning how to use existing engines, if not making your own. I realise that comparing this is like comparing apples to oranges, but Unreal Engine and Unity are free.

It's the successor to the Multimedia Fusion and The Games Factory - and it shows. The UI is dated with some of the editors being almost unchanged from the 90s. It looks like an early 2000s Windows app. It's slow and clunky. The event editor is a mess. Basically, it feels like a Win9x app at times - because Clickteam have slapped a terrible outdated Visual Studio UI onto tools that were around in The Games Factory.While it's one of the more flexible of the event-based game development systems, and there are a load of extensions and commerical games made with it, it's still a mess of a program to use. There's a good idea and amount of flexibility buried here, but it's significantly hampered by the atrocious UI and Win9x thinking that Clickteam are clinging to. If you want to make games there's better software. Construct 2 is a highly competent and modern event-based app which is much more user friendly and cheaper (although it only exports to HTML5). If you're serious about making games, get GameMaker Studio and learn to code.Don't buy this. I was using its early successors in the late 90s/early 2000s and very little has changed."

The in-program tutorials are somewhat difficult to follow and would be aided by video counterparts (starting at Chocoblast Lesson 11 - but never fear, video turorials are abundant online via other websites), but some quick online searches will help you put together the missing pieces (face it - if you really want to develop a game beyond the hobby level you'll need to enhance your own personal troubleshooting skills anyway, so don't let the getting-up-to-speed tutorial issues bother you).

So that's roughly £600 worth of software and licences for £12. So am I duty bound to give it a good review? Well no, of course not. That's a fallacious argument. £12 is £12 and still a meaningful sum to somebody who is currently on a very low income like myself. However, after spending nearly 5 hours using this, for £12 I DEFINITELY would recommend it (it's no longer on the Humble Store but I've noticed deals and bundles to come around again, so keep checking).So yes, there's my caveat, but only for the moment, as six months down the line, after using it a great deal more, I may well turn around and say it is worth purchasing regardless of price (and I shall amend this review in six months if it turns out to be the case!)The sense of satisfaction I got after following the first tutorial - the simple Breakout clone named 'Choco Breakout' was immense. It was easy to understand the logical arguments and how to slect them. It was easy grasping the concept of 'frames' and how these can easily be moved around in the game. And then, once my breakout game was complete, with the opening screen, high score table and end game screen, I then had great fun going into all the options and altering the graphics, customising the buttons, recording my voice as a .wav file and having me say 'ouch' when the ball hit the brick, and so on, and so on.So yes, I have enjoyed it so far. Whether it is robus and flexible enough for me to achieve my long term goal - of producing a polished game worth enough to be sold on Steam - remains a different matter.Still, for now, I am definitely recommending it."

I currently use it for college projects and personal projects and it can be stress free at times. Here are a few pros I would like to point out:> Most of the time, its simple and easy to use.> There's no need for you to have any coding knowledge.> Importing objects and frames is stress free.> Adding soundtracks of SFX is very simple.> There a broad range of free extensions which makes life easier.> Good software to start off with if you want to go down the route of Game Development and design.Don't underestimate the software because there are some cons:> To create complex games, you will need a great understanding of how the software works...> Tutorials online are extremely hard to come by, especially advanced tutorials where the conditions are similar or exact to what you want. (There is however, a  set of ""starter's"" tutorials which come with Clickteam which covers the basics).> Sometimes, to do a simple thing, you may need a lot of events. (which are conditions inputted by the user which Clickteam ""reads"" to perform an action).> Some events may even require mathematics to work otherwise you get the ""Syntax Error"" B***S***!> Some text objects (*cough* Counters *cough*) do not anti-alias, so you end up with a poor looking text graphic. You can create your own text however but this up more time and effort.> To create nice looking graphics, its recommended you create the graphics inside an external program such as Adobe Photoshop, Krita, GIMP or even MS Paint! Reason being is the visuals editor is very basic and isn't very attractive, so its best to avoid it if you want nice graphics.> Pay £640 if you want everything.> Limited to 2D graphics and basic 3D graphics.All in all, its good for starting off but I recommend trying Unreal Engine or Unity as they are free and produce a much more greater outcome."
