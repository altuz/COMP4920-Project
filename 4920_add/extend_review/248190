,Recommended,248190,10928218,"Posted: 28 June, 2014",all,YellowLab,"Knytt Underground is a 2D platform game of exploration with a quirky story. You play as Mi Sprocket who is a mute sprite. She is chosen to go on a quest (because her brother freaked out or something) to ring the six bells in order to prevent the world from being destroyed. Along the way she picks up two pixies who are her voice. Dora and Cilia couldn't be more polar opposite. One is kind and considerate. The other is brazen and brash.The first two ""Chapters"" of the game are a kind of tutorial. The first shows you Mi. She can run and jump and climb. She also picks up colored lights and can activate them for a one time special power.The second introduces you to Bob. Bob is a ball, and can bounce. Pretty high. He also can create a static field around him that will pull him to special robots to allow him to play Tarzan the ball.This will take about 90 minutes. Then you get to meat of the game...Chapter three. The map in Chapter three is a rectangle 30 by 48 (1440) screens. Plus several secret areas not on the map including a small inverted world and you have a huge world to explore.There are side quests to complete and some symbols hidden in what seem to be extremely inaccessible areas. There are other sprites and pixies around the world that tell a quirky story about some sprite ""religions"" having to do with technology.The environments are unique. The different areas of the underground each come with different theme music. The part I liked best was trying to get items that seemed to be inaccessible. Many times you look at a screen and say ""No way"" can that item be picked up. Then you go through the game and learn some tricks that will allow you pick them up. The mapping system does a good job marking these items (i) as well as quests (Q) on your map.There have been many discussions around the internet regarding the controls for this game. Personally, I didn't find them to be an issue. I have been playing games with a keyboard for a very long time. Arrows to move, ""A"" to use the special power, and ""S"" to switch between states. The only issues that I had were on some of the timing puzzles and pressing the wrong button (A instead of S). I thought keyboard controls worked well with the game.I would say to try the demo, but this only lets you play through the first chapter. While this will give you some feel for the game, the real meat and potatoes is in the third chapter. All I can say is I had a lot of fun exploring this game and having the story unfold."

Only negative point goes for the lack of native controller support, although I've played it first on a playstation and find the pc+keyboard  version to be much more responsive. Some puzzles are quite frustrating, but what's the fun otherwise? I've recommended this to every single person I love."

The game is comprised of Three chapters, the first two are 30-45 minutes each and will leave you worried the game is going to be 2 hours long. Fear not. Chapter Three offers the vast Kyntt exploration we know and love.That is to say, Kyntt is a Metroidvania exploration game without the normal character progression you'd normally see holding you back. Instead there are a number of clever puzzles that are challenging but shouldn't leave you frustrated (in my experience so far at least). Instead the game reigns you in through, first and foremost, a vast world that forces you to explore your local area or you'll miss much of the beauty of the game, but at the same time makes it extremely clear that you've reached a deadend on the map so you're not left wondering if you can make a jump or not.The second way it gives you a sense of progression comes by letting you try things. In some instances it explicitly warns you not to until you know more about this or that and if you ignore the warning chances are you're going to fail unless you already know what you're doing. It's a nice way of developing the story and mechanics for first time players without forcing repeat players through lengthy tutorials.That's the kind of game creator Nifflas is. ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.(Also, he's make a lot of other games with Knytt and Ball.

If not, buy this game anyways.Knytt Underground is, by and large, one of the best 2D platformers available on the PC.The game has beautiful environments, an excellent soundtrack and level ambience that can put sites likeasoftmurmur.comto shame. Simply put, it's therapeutic to the nth degree. The platforming is simply top notch with (no exaggeration) perfect, 1:1 controls and level design that can get pretty nintendo hard at times. The 'overworld' itself is freaking massive - and like any other Nifflas game, it's packed to the brim with secrets. Youwillmiss secrets on your first playthrough, guaranteed.However, KU is not without its faults. Oneterribly massivecon - no native controller support. It's very easy to work around this, (tryControllerToKeyboardfor Windows,Enjoyablefor OSX, orqJoyPadfor Linux) but you'd think for a PC platformer it would come with partial support at the very least. There is also a surprising amount of dialogue for such a game, but you're really not missing much if you skip through all of it. If you're capable of reading a minimap, you can skip through all the dialogue you want."

(And if you haven't, Within A Deep Forest and Knytt Stories are both freeware, so go play them). And I don't just say that because your characters control like the two from those games. However, this is not just ""more of the same"", and does see him treading new ground.Gameplay is exploration heavy and very atmospheric. Many areas have puzzles or hazards like enemies and lava, and in some cases (mostly in secret levels) those can be quite difficult. However, those are not the focus of the game, and many other areas there's only platforming or even no obstacles at all. You don't gain permanent powerups, but areas may have objects that give you temporary abilities. Emphasis is on the scenary and atmosphere instead, and on the story.Yes, the story. And that's the new ground: The story here is very good. You spend most of the game with two companions with layered personalities and backstories, and can choose which one of them will talk for you with most NPCs. As you explore you'll uncover more of their backstory along with the mute protagonist's. The story defies a lot of genre conventions; quests don't always end in a way the characters find satisfying (though they usually do), people are occasionally unable or unwilling to compensate you, and ultimately a lot of doubt is cast on the claim that your quest to ""save the world"" is actually doing anything. Combined with the unusual backstories and themes, it is a pretty unique experience.The game becomes extremely nonlinear once you beat the introductory chapters. You can explore in any direction as far as you want, and the world is huge, but if you want you can ""beat"" the game before seeing huge portions of it. There's also tons of secret rooms and levels, both within the game world and accessible from exploring the menu/hub world.Overall, I'd highly recommend trying this game. Just don't expect any aspect of it to be fast paced."

,Not Recommended,248190,22187844,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,Silva,"I want to start the review of Knytt Underground with one statement up front: I do not believe it to be a bad game, exactly. It does what it sets out to do, and does it well. The problem is that Knytt Undeground intends from a game design standpoint is not what I enjoy from games of its genre. I knew from the outset that the game is somewhat unconventional, but hoped I would enjoy it regardless. I did, for a time.What the game does right:Despite taking place underground, the game has a wide variety of backgrounds to its locations that can be quite beautiful.The game prepares you relatively well for its platforming mechanics, which effectively make a great deal of its rooms into puzzles.The feeling of finally making the tricky series of jumps required for some of the exploration/puzzles is satisfying.The setting, if not the plot, is intriguing.Why I lost interest regardless:The first two chapters of the game are brief and relatively linear, and basically tutorials for the extremely non-linear chapter 3. The lack of any sense of focus in chapter 3 felt more to its detriment than benefit.After the beginning of chapter 3, the player receives no new abilities that change the gameplay in any significant way. Powerups are instead temporary, scattered through the map for the specific purpose of navigating one or a few rooms.Because of the temporary nature of powerups and unchanging nature of the player's capabilities, the game lost all sense of progression. I could explore the third chapter's map to its loosely defined goals, but never felt rewarded for doing so outside satisfying my own curiosity. I did just that for a few hours, before the lack of perceived advancement made Knytt Underground more boring than entertaining.So, do I recommend Knytt Undeground? Yes and no.Do you feel that exploration is its own reward? Then by all means, play it.Is curiosity alone enough for you to play a game for hours on end? If so, you'll probably have a good time.Do you need greater motivation in gameplay terms than either of those things, as I did? Then, unfortunately, Knytt Underground probably won't be very satisfying.I genuinely wanted to like the game, and I hope others do, but it was not for me."

Challenging, but never to the point that I lost my♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is partly due to the fact that I spent much of my time simply exploring it's brilliant world and talking to the interesting, amusing, and complex characters.The art style is absolutely brilliant, and mostly consists of black sillhouette foregrounds, cartooney characters and backgrouns made of photos of various things like rocks and flowers, and such, pieced together in interesting ways.The music is often times quite trippy and kind of melancholy, which really adds to the lonely atmosphere of the game. It's surprising that a game about sprites and fairies in a post-apocalyptic world, could have some of the most realistic, and  deep characters of any game I've ever played.Bottom line, this is a game that has so much fun platforming, puzzle solving, exploration, atmosphere, and heart that...just buy it already!

(If you haven't played them, go and do so. They're free, and give a good grasp of the feel of Nifflas' games)What really differentiates Knytt Underground from Nifflas' prior work is the story. I've seen all too many reviews disregard the story, saying it's weak. An awful lot of reviewers have evidently missed what the story is. The central plot is not the story. It's little more than a framing work, something to give you a reason to go and explore the hauntingly beautiful landscape.The real story is on the side-lines. It's about religion, and whether it matters if there's a god, and WHY it matters to people whether or not there is. It's about the good, the bad and the ugly of faith and belief and all the little insecurities of life. It's supported in this by a very human cast. (Which is vaguely amusing given the lack of humans present.) I actually cared about Dora, and Cilia, and even the little side characters who did little but add flavour to the world, building it up to something that feels real.My love of this game can only be aptly compared to my love of the works of Tove Jansson, whose Moomin series holds a strong resemblance to the work.Let this vaguely aimed and rambling essay tell you: This game is worth it."

The control-switching feature makes for interesting challenges and feels well-suited to smooth, efficient movement when exploring (although you might prefer to slow down and admire the backgrounds). Furthermore, the game is overflowing with secrets, to the point of having secrets nested within secrets.The game stars a mute sprite named ""Mi"" and later a pair of fairies that speak for her - your interactions with other NPCs serve to characterize the trio.

It's Too Much of A Good Thing.Genre: Indie 2D Platformer Exploration Game.Developed & Published by: Nifflas' Games & RipstonePlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, PS3 and Vita.Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by MyselfOverall Game & Story ThoughtsKnytt Underground is a 2D platformer/exploration/physics puzzler developed by Nifflas’ Group. It’s the third game in the series though you won’t likely have heard of the previous two games as they never made it to Steam. You follow the adventures of Mi, a mute sprite who must ring six special bells in this underground world in order to save it. She is joined by a sentient, yet also mute, bouncing ball and two fairies. So, with this quirky cast of characters, you are tasked to save the world….and fetch every single item in this vast world of sprites.You begin with a couple of short tutorial chapters to get you familiar with the game mechanics that Knytt has. After that, the game throws everything and the kitchen sink at you in chapter three. The game world is huge and there is a lot to see. Much of the game is focused around exploring every nook and cranny while listening to a pretty darn good soundtrack. There's also a story involving your two companion fairies that gets fleshed out during your adventures though I found the writing to be wonky. Basically, there's a science VS religion theme going throughout the story and I'm not convinced that it pulls it off that well. The two fairies themselves are also a bit two dimensional and predictable to how they'll treat each situation. It's not well written.Level DesignWhile the game has over 1,800 rooms to explore, a lot of them are empty corridors and dead-ends. A very large majority of the quests in this game are fetch quests and the rest are finding somebody. (So, just ½ of the fetch quest). Most items are obtained after solving physics-based puzzles that get continually harder as the game progresses. Getting around the world is a chore as the fast-travel system is very gimmicky and tricky to get to the area that you really want to be. The whole shadow world that has you rushing in a netherworld to get to the exit but if you don't get there in time, you'll be thrown into a random room that doesn't help you progress forward. It can get extremely tiresome to deal with.The Game's ContentI will say that I enjoyed the exploration...for a while. I enjoyed the puzzles...for a while. I enjoyed the fetch quests...for a while. It’s really a testament to the game that I tolerated 14 hours of fetch quests. But towards the end of the game, I just wanted it to end. The game’s content is bloated, repetitive and lacking in interesting new mechanics to explore after a while. While being able to transform into a ball is a little different on the platforming genre, I think its the worst part of the game as some areas and puzzles require extremely precise jumping in order to pass.RagequitThe game ended for me when I got to the 5th major locked door in the game. Each bell that has to be rung is locked by a jerkface sprite that demands you hand over items for varying reasons ranging from “I’m just like this because reasons” to“You need to PROVE yourself”. (This goes back to my complaint that the story isn't well written). When I was told, at the 5th door, that I still needed more items in order to pass, (and hence complete the game) I pretty much said this:NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE. I’M DONE, I’M FINISHED. I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. And promptly quit the game. I do understand that there are ways to get around the bell without paying but it requires trial and error to get around him through the other world system. I can only tolerate so much of the same repetitive activity. The enemy variety is lacking and many of the >physics< puzzles consist of a lot of trial and error. An absurd amount of trial and error dependent on nailing skillshots at the right time in the midst of bouncing around the room. It can get very quickly frustrating after dealing with it for 10+ hours. There's nothing there to really vary it up.PC SettingsKnytt has rebindable keys and audio sliders. Graphics settings are extremely basic, allowing for changing full screen and some enabling/disabling minor effects. That's all. It's a stunningly basic settings menu. While 2D games don't necessarily need a lot of settings, not even having the basic such as V-Sync or Resolution is not ok. One last note: the character running around in the chapter-select screen is cute but please don’t add it to future games. Adding time to entering the game (especially when its the longest path of all the three chapters) gets very old. Using a regular menu UI is much more preferable to getting us into the actual game. No need to make a repetitive game out of entering theactualgame.Final ThoughtsI can’t recommend Knytt Underground. The game is unique with a great soundtrack and solid enough presentation for sure but the repetitive gameplay and frustrating trial-and-error puzzles drove me insane. It’s a large ocean of a world with the depth of a puddle. Adding different kinds of quests and less item questing would have made the experience more enjoyable in my mind. The game is far too long considering its story and mechanical depth. You'll realistically see most of the game's mechanics in the first two tutorial levels before moving onto the main world. Said world will only slightly change things up, but depend far too much on what it first designed to create challenges. The story itself takes too long (mostly due to the game's pacing issues) and has a central, if uninteresting, conflict between religion and science that has been done better elsewhere. This is, bemusingly, too much content for this game's concept and execution.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade"

The stories were so spread out and so jumbled over the many hours of play, it was difficult to necessarily remember characters from time to time as they came up.  Even with the three protagonists, this was a problem, as I couldn't always recall what details were true of which one.The second thing that didn't work out was the warp zones.  The entries to them were so spread out, and the exits not marked on the map at all.  So it always seemed better not to use them and walk straight to where I was going, rather than possibly walk the same distance and break a crystal.What is great is the feeling that you are exploring a real space.  This isn't an over map and castles, everywhere is connected to everywhere else, there are no barriers.There are also some quite surprisingly beautiful set pieces, with music that wonderfully accompanies them.And as in Knytt, the pitter patter of the running and jumping is very satisfying.Finally, I have not idea why this game is M-rated.  Because one of the characters is a lesbian?  I find making a game M-rated simply because lesbians exist extremely offensive."

Within a Deep Forest, Knytt, Knytt Stories, a bunch of Knytt stories community modules, Saira, and Nightsky. This...this is not a fun game. I wanted to like it, but frankly it's just as disappointing as I found Nightsky.There are two main problems. First, the -mood- of the game is terrible. Yes, it's called ""Underground"", but the art style and background style is far far too gloomy. The aesthetics are just a huge turn-off. The background images tend to be real images or 3d rendered images that seem completely out of place. The terrain is simply all black. The color palette for the entire game is a poorly chosen collection of neons and gray hues, clashing with the cartoonish style. It's just all terrible.Second, the gameplay isn't any good. The dev has had 5 games to polish it up, but the new mechanics introduced like switches and really inaccurate swinging are more annoying than fun. Add to that the focus on 'new things' means there's little focus on making good classic Knytt platforming and the game suffers for it. All in all, a big fat Do Not Recommend."

While retaining similar mechanics to previous games (running, jumping, exploration and fetch quests), the games adds in a lot more characters and dialogue making it a somewhat ""chatty"" experience. But the dialogue is tacky. It feels like something I would think was cool in middle school, and if I was trying to write something in a second language. The scenery consists of photoshopped fruits and hardware that feels tacked on, like early 90's CG in action movies. The story is juvenile and plodding. The game forces is episodic, and each episode ends up with you retracing places you've been before, but rather than being part of the exploration or platforming it's just something that makes you run back and forth.These games are all about the atmosphere and solid mechanics as you explore an otherwise featureless world for vaguely defined reasons. The formula didn't work so well in this incarnation. To sum up: cringe-worthy characters and dialogue, passionless art, less-interesting level design than previous fare. Only for hardcore Nifflas fans, or if you're really bored, I guess."

Knytt Underground is a more conspicuously narrative-driven sequel to Knytt Stories and Within A Deep Forest, and puts the platforming mechanics of each (climbing and bouncing, respectively) to good use. Those two mechanics are most of what you'll be doing in this game - besides gawking, since the art and soundtrack are absolutely lovely - and honestly it's a lot of fun just to get around. The game world's vast, once you get into it, and if you want to take it all in, you can easily spend upwards of twenty hours just exploring its labyrinthine and visually stunning caves, tunnels, and underwater labs. It's paced a bit slow for a metroidvania adventure - Knytt Underground is about exploration, with very few enemies and a lot of map. But it's the world design, not the enemies, that make this game what it is, and the environments will make you work out how to get from A to B in some very clever ways. There are caverns and side challenges that require you to string together perfectly timed mid-air button presses, secret rooms (over 500 of them in addition to the 1,440 that appear on the map) and a huge variety to the places you'll visit that makes discovering a new area feel exciting. What a game! Knytt Underground brings together the knuckle-biting platforming challenges with an endearing and memorable landscape, introspective dialogue, really genuinely fantastic sound design, and over three and a half hours of gorgeous background music. Don't miss the music, it's really great."

Don't let the first two chapters fool you, those are just to ease you into it. After that you'll experience a great deal of freedom while traversing the map.+ Beautiful atmospherical graphics. Just look at those screenshots.+ Nice music as well. No wait, the music is awesome, and so is the sound design.+ Very simple but fun, tight mechanics.~ Don't expect any kind of deep emotional storyline. It's cute and funny at times and there is some (actually quite some) intruiging lore to try to make sense of, but the way it's conveyed didn't work quite enough for me, personally. I would have loved a bit more of immersive style of writing, the wit of the dialogues pull me out of it too much. Or rather they fail to draw me in.- Unfortunately the fixed resolution is kinda low, especially on a 27"" monitor. I have played this before on the PS Vita (one of my favorite games on that platform) and there it looks pretty clean and sharp. Not as much now, although it's still pretty enough to get fully immersed in. So arguably the PC is not the best way to play this game, maybe. Maybe.Having said that I would nevertheless heartily recommend this game for anyone fond of 2D platforming world exploration kind of games. It's very satisfting discovering new areas while jumping around like the most agile spelunker in history. Get this game, especially when it's on sale.!"

76561198294456501,Recommended,248190,29267453,Posted: 15 January,all,vlad76,"I feel conflicted about this game - I wish there was a ""neutral"" feedback option.I certainly enjoyed many aspects of the game, such as most of the design elements, as well as the soundtrack.However, I feel that there are also some issues that need to be pointed out here.First, the game is too long for what it is. While I do appreciate the designer’s efforts to create the large and diverse map, the gameplay does not really benefit from it. By the time I was about 75% through the game, I was already bored with it, to the extent that I almost didn't even have the motivation to finish the game.Second, the ball physics are rather frustrating. The ball is difficult to control with any degree of accuracy, and in many tasks that involve using the ball you basically have to rely on a serious dose of luck in order to get through.Which brings me to the third, and most important point. In many of game's puzzles, the solution can be fairly obvious. However, you then have to spend a significant amount of time repeating the same action numerous times, until you get everything lined up to the millimetre and the timing to the second, exactly as the developer intended - or else it won’t work, and you'd have to try again. This type of challenges is just not particularly interesting to me, as they are in no way intellectually stimulating. In fact, they are not fun or entertaining, but rather frustrating and annoying.Also worth mentioning is that in some areas of the map the soundtrack is bugged by various crackling and popping noises - I guess some of the soundtrack files might be corrupted.The ending is also kind of a letdown, to the extent that the developer himself admits it. Personally I expected that there might be another puzzle after the last bell, possibly involving the giant clock in the area right above it. But no - the ending is kind of abrupt, and basically  it leaves you with the sensation that something is missing - some kind of definitive conclusion, one way or the other. It is obvious that the dev left it that way on purpose, but what can I say - philosophy and entertainment don't mix particularly well.Anyway, the game is not perfect, but despite its flaws it would be difficult not to recommend it. Most of the artwork in the game is beautiful, and creates a special atmosphere that is worth experiencing. Chances are, you will enjoy it, at least up to a point. Pick it up when on sale, and you won't regret it."
