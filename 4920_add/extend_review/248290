76561197995343647,Not Recommended,248290,13348032,"Posted: 13 December, 2014",all,Hopefully Humble Tim,"As a botanist and a gamer, Reach for the Sun makes me feel both sad and embarassed. It's not a fun game; it's not a good learning tool; and the lessons that it does teach are often wrong. Yet, somehow, this game has won multiple awards, and the fact of those awards really does make me sad. To give this game an award is to suggest that this is the best we can do. That suggestion is disrespectful to science, because science has huge potential for fun (e.g. Kerbal Space Program). It's also disrespectful to gamers, and to our proven ability to create great games.The most obvious problem is that the gameplay is all about clicking - even in strategy mode, it's all about the clicking.A much bigger problem is that, as a player, you have very little agency. You can't just grow your plant in whatever way you like. Instead, each plant has a predetermined fully-grown shape, a shape that was fixed by the developers at compile time. When you add new parts to a plant, you're really just unlocking bits of that predetermined shape. This means that the game is much more about memorization than it is about botany or tactics. To be successful, you need to learn the shape of the fully-grown plant, and then figure out the series of choices that will allow you to most quickly unlock all of the parts of your plant.As a botanist, I teach that plants must adapt themselves to their environment by making choices about how they will grow. If a seed lands in an unfortunate place, it can't simply pick itself up and go somewhere else, but must instead grow where it lies. For example, a bush on a rocky cliff may grow short and squat to protect itself from cold and wind; while a bush in a shady glade may grow tall and slim to try and reach above its neighbors, and grab a bigger share of sunlight. Thus, the idea that each species of plant has a fixed shape (an idea implicitly taught by this game) is false and misleading.Another big flaw in the game is the lack of differentiation among species. While there are several different species in this game, from a gameplay standpoint, they're pretty much the same. As a gamer, I find this boring. As a botanist, I find it offensive. The joy and beauty in life and biology come from from the huge variety of shapes, colors, and behaviors that are present in nature. To teach otherwise, as this game does, is a terrible lie.If you're looking for a bit of variety in your procrastination, something to give you a break from Peggle or Candy Crush, then you may find a bit of enjoyment in this game. If you're looking for something with replay value or educational value, you should look elsewhere."

The game doesn't offer too much gameplay time (aka replay value is pretty low, at least until they release more type of plants and maybe more extra stuff, if they ever do), but again - for $5 it's pretty much a fair deal. It's definitely not worth any more than that, though."

The update also had the unseen benefeit of cutting down a graphical issues, since it can go as a turn-based, not real-time."
,Recommended,248290,8554320,"Posted: 4 January, 2014",all,Chris Fifty-Two,A small educational game about plants that sadly lacks depth and becomes a manic click-fest just to gather your resources in time. Not quite sure how I would improve the game but its gameplay could need a fair bit of tweaking. The dev do seem fairly active so the game can still be very much improved.Very simplistic achievements that mostly are tied to upgrades and growing each plant in an optimal way.Time to 100%:2-3 hours
,Not Recommended,248290,7759961,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,tycho5,"Interesting game. The concept is what got me interested but at the end of the day, it felt like a click fest with no discernable goal or end game to achieve.Why am I trying to grow individual flowers? Is it for the seeds? So that next season I can plant one more flower?If they added some scale to this game, like, every year you have a few more flowers to take care of simultaneously, and then eventually you're tending a garden or something, it might have held my interest.Beyond that, all I did was click click click click click click click click click to get a flower grown and harvest my seeds. Kind of one dimensional I guess...Cool concept, needs more end game. Thanks for teaching me about plants."

The game is short, there's a LOT of clicking involved, there's no storyline or anything. Even the achievements only took a couple hours to get.I wouldn't buy it unless you have some sort of need to have every plant game available on Steam."
,Not Recommended,248290,7799101,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,JMK,"On surface level the concept seems very interesting. For once, instead of killing monsters and shooting people, you get to grow a flower and spread new life! With multiple different flowers and an upgrade system you're bound to have many hours of fun here, right?Well, sadly no. There doesn't seem to be any way to really strategize the growing of your flowers, since there's actually only one right way to grow all the flowers, which there are four visually different ones, but which play identically. Reach for the Sun really feels like a simple flash game made as a proof-of-concept or something similar. Play time is somewhere under an hour after which you have gained everything and done everything.A shame really. With extended gameplay and more interesting mechanics the game could potentially be a unique little flower, but currently it is just over-priced run-of-the-mill flash game you could find on any website."
,Recommended,248290,22490119,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,AbbydonPrime,"This game does a decent job, on an extremely basic level, at showing how plants function. The goal is to grow the plant to its complete size and harvest all of the seeds before the growing season is over.Overall, the plants are very similar in that they have predefined growth points. Sometimes you get the option to grow a flower instead of a node, but not often. The only thing that really differs between the plants other than the looks, seed production, and some other basic things is that each one generates and requires varying amount of resources to create more roots, notes, leaves, flowers, and fruit.What is not very obvious at first is that this is less about learning about the plants and more of a resource-harvesting clicker game. In order to gain any of the resources to keep growing your plants, you have to click on each part that glows. If you don't click as soon as the glow appears, the amount you can gather goes down and will eventually be lost. As your plant gets larger, the clicking turns into a frenzy. Meanwhile, you're also trying to grow more by clicking on the growth points.Once you have a flower, not only do you have to tell the flower to create pollen, but you have to manually drag a bee to the flower. This wastes valuable time that can be used to click for more resources. Before the garden is fully upgraded, you also have to worry about clicking on pests, pulling off blighted leaves, and warming up frost-bitten leaves.Even with all of the clicking requirements, I was able to obtain all of the achievements and fully grow the prickly pear within 2 hours. I haven't played it in Strategy mode, but the growth model is the same. I can't really see any replay value. There is plenty of room for improvement, such as more types of plants, freeform growth instead of pre-defined points, sandbox mode (no season timer, etc), and more realism.I'm recommending it because it was a pleasant little game that is a bit different from the few in its class. Due to the lack of replay and the really short playtime, my recommendation is only if it's on sale. I bought this as part of a weeklong deal at 75% off ($1.24). My general rule for no-replay casual games is $1/hr. The sale puts it in that realm.---For more...My Reviews||My casual gaming...Group|Curator Page"

The graphics are moderate, it makes sense to play it in a window. And it's a veritable clickfest.I bought the game because I am a hobby botanist and love to raise exotic plants. The harder the challenge seems the more delighted I will be, if I am successful. But(!), this game has had good ideas and is innovative. It still isn't going to keep it's high pretensions.And there is another thing that is quite anoying, it is over way too fast. Ok, given  it costs only 5 bucks, but even for five bucks a game that is that short is quite expensive. It has some good stylish artwork, and good soundtrack, ok - but the rest - well you could expect more of course.This is one of those games, that is causing strife - should I give it a recomendation or should I just say no to it? Beyond the basics, this game isn't more than a procrastination help - ok, it's a resource management simulation, but beyond that it's not ""the perfect"" waste of time.It's of course an ""educational"" game, but again, this is superficial education - a good idea would be to have different environments, different soils, and some more plants that those five. Furthermore, it would have been a great idea to give the plants more than just some bugs... there are a lot more things that can give a plant brown leaves, and yes - to most of those issues a praying mantis would probably be ... not very helpful.If they (the devs) should ever mind to make a sequel, they should probably keep in mind that there are also people would love a more complex game.Sorry, to not give this game a recomendation - but it's far less the game I expected."

It has a lot of good points, but overall, I'm afraid I'm not going to recommend it. On the positive, the graphics are lovely and the concept is good. It has a nice sound track and is very relaxing -- it is great to have a game that has a calm, positive, non-destructive theme. Although the gameplay is simple, it is not off putting. The ""normal"" mode is a bit of a click-fest, but the ""strategy"" mode solves that and makes it playable. What the game lacks though is depth and challenge. There are only five plants (sunflower, toad lily, lilac, squash and prickly pear) and having more would be better. The upgrades are also somewhat limited. And the ""hard"" plants are still straighforward to play-and-complete, without requiring too much thought. As a result, it is pretty quick to get through all of it. A few other problems exist (no full-screen mode, difficult to get to the almanac, etc.) and although it talks about plant biology, it does go into much detail with it. If you like a peacful, simple game then maybe, but otherwise the lack of depth lets it down. So, not recommended, but it was a close call."

It is not the sort you play to get psyched, excited, to feel the rush of blood one would get from winning in PvP or getting a head shot; it is the sort of game you would enjoy at a zen garden, during a short break, or just before going to bed to wind down.If I have to criticize, I would say that ""Reach for the Sun"" lacks development. The game have potentials but the developers failed to bring out it's shine; there are five different kinds of plant and that's all there is to it, and the gameplay is the same for all five of them. The game might benefit a bit more interesting and longlasting if there are a dozen or more plant, which is where the developers should spent their time on; but instread, the devlopers spend a sizeable chunck of their time on the in game Almanac and putting a voiceover like it's a audio book. Which is the one feature that I literally never use because the game already have a comprehensive tutorial.However, for those who enjoys relaxing, light puzzle games, I'd still recommend giving this game a shot.

That being said, classic mode was by far the more exciting of the two and I found myself concentrating and getting quite hurried, especially towards the end of the growing season! However, both modes are pretty easy and i beat the whole game in about 2 hours. The powerups unfortunately do not do much and actually remove some of the more interesting parts of gameplay.Visuals - Fairlly pretty! But for the simplicity, they need a pretty beefed up computer to run smoothly, and I didnt notice much difference between low and ultra, apart from the speed. The flowers look lovely, almost as a painting, but you dont really see them growing as such, just parts such as stems suddenly extend from a node.Sound - AMAZING. Really lovely relaxing music that I felt was almost taking me away to a meadow - compliments the game perfectly and is great to relax with.Replay value - UMMMMMM... I beat the game yesterday for the second time - this was the second time I played the game since I bought it about a year ago. It's a decent game to come back to now and again when you're in the mood, but for £4, it does seem a little much for such little replayability.VERDICT: If you want a relaxing game that won't task you too much, this is probably a fairly good game for you. I wouldn't buy it again for £4, but that being said, I did tend to play it during exam revision so maybe theres a bit of relaxtion potential there.

,Not Recommended,248290,8025723,"Posted: 12 December, 2013",all,2064,"This review must be posted. The trailer really got me. I'm a big fan of learning things through gaming, but this is far from complete. This is like the most basic stuff every kid gets exposed to in grade school or junior high and that's all there is to it, just a cover page. The idea is definitely great, but this game is just not worth the money right now. Not even worth being on a phone app. Let's be real, it's a click fest because it's not teaching you anything you don't already know and there's no need to think about whether you're clicking for the right reason or not because all you need to do is just click and you'll advance. That's all that mattered, advancing to the next stage. That's what a game is about. This would probably be a lot better if it was like a puzzle, where you'd actually need to think about what you're doing and the outcome. This game just turned my brain off after the tutorial. I would be all for this if it's worth the money, but seriously people, do not waste your money on this! Unless you've never seen a PLANT before...that's not possible...right? That's not even a valid reason to buy this anyway.Gameplay is not even worth going past the tutorial. The tutorial itself is the whole game basically. After that, it's like whack a mole, clicking on anything and everything whenever you can. The game uses ""seeds"" as currency to get access to other plants' seeds and upgrades. You start with 1 seed which lets you buy the sunflower seed and start the game, which I don't see the point in this step. Sunflower is also the only plant you can do the tutorial on, which they always prompt you about if you decide to play sunflower again. Tutorial is pretty easy to understand. There's 3 resources, Water, Nutrient, and Starch. You get water and nutrient from clicking on the roots when they glow, and starch from leaves when they glow. Starch always costs water and sometimes nutrient in order to be acquired due to photosynthesis. Expanding the flower requires all resources in increasing amounts. Goal of the game is to get flowers and pollenate it to acquire the ""fruits"" for their seeds. There are 4 different plants, 3 of them can self pollenate and only 1 requires male and female flowers. Gameplay for all 4 plants are exactly the same, just keep clicking.They do try to make it challenging, in an unchallenging way. There's 1 bug that flies around and land on a predetermined leaf and will suck on all 3 of your resources for 1 point per second until you click on it and it will just fall...Then there's a worm that would dig to a predetermined root and suck on your resources also for 1 point per second until you click on it and it will just wither away. Otherwise they will move to another leaf or root and do the same thing again, but nothing else changes, like it doesn't actually eat off the leaf or root. There's also a butterfly that flies around sometimes and lands on the ground and do nothing...If you click on it, it will fly away, but it doesn't contribute anything, not even help pollinate! There's environmental effects such as blight on leaves, where the leaves have dark spots rendering it useless, then you'll have to click and pull that leaf off and you'll be able to grow a new one to replace it. There's cold snap, in which the leaves are starting to freeze but that's no biggie, just click on the affected leaf and hold until the little flashlight warms it back up. There's really nothing to hold you back from completing your goal before the time is up. Speaking of time, the game runs from Spring to Winter starting with Februrary or March to November or December. Each month lasts for 1 minute for a total of 10 minutes. 4 different plants, 10 minutes each, done within an hour MAX. This is an expensive game for less than an hour of gameplay.They do have upgrades, which are suppose to make things easier, as if it's not easy enough without it. There's the Mulch which pretty much cancels out environmental damage to the plant, the blight and cold snap so you don't even need to deal with it. There's the Water pail, which gives you a lot more water AND nutrient per click on roots. There's the Fertilizer which is suppose to provide more nutrient, but it didn't have any effect if any since it's actually in the Water pail upgrade. They probably missed that. Then there's the Preying Mantis, which takes away the need to look out for bugs and worms. Basically makes your clicks more efficient and focus better on clicking... Once you've obtained all the seeds and upgrades, there's really no point in getting any more seeds. And the fact that they have a time stamp on how fast you complete each plant just makes this even more obvious as a click fest. How strategically fast can you click through this level? Oh and if you ever decide you open this game again and choose ""New Game"", it resets everything as in a whole new game. Yep, as if it's your first time all over again. Talk about replay value.They always have the equation for photosynthesis on the top of the screen, which doesn't contribute to anything at all, other than letting you know which part of the photosynthesis process is going on whenever you acquire a resource. This game is really incomplete as a learning game. Take my word for it everyone, this is not a game that's worth money at the moment. Not even the $5 sale which I thought was a deal. Little did I know. It needs a lot more information to be educating anybody about plants.*EDIT* 02/02/2014Checked out the new patch to see if it's worth any more time, it's still not worth it.The new strategy mode is a good direction, takes away the mindless clicking. BUT! That's basically all it does, covering up the click fest. On the left side of the screen, it tells you the cost of all the possible upgrades if you were able to access them. As in upgrading a stem would cost this much, leaf would cost this much, pollen would cost this much, etc. The bottom right has a ""next turn"" button which also shows the amount of resources you would obtain in the next turn. Bottom left still have the amount of resources on hand. Pretty easy, straight forward, nothing new here guys, as in nothing to learn about a plant. Oh, I almost forgot, they have this new ""bee"" pollinator, which I find even more annoying than what they had before. Every time you get the pollen, a bee will always show up on the top left corner, and then you'll have to drag that bee to the flower. If I was a 10 year old that didn't know better, I would think in the real world, I'll have to find a bee and drag it to a flower in order to pollinate it. There's no big improvement from what I played last time. If anything, it's not improving on what the game is suppose to be about, but just what it's not.Sure, they added a new plant, but what about it? What's the origin of the plant? Where is it indigenous to? What's the binomial name? What makes it special/unique/interesting that I would want to learn about it? Is it used to make anything other than just being a flower? I mean, there's a lot more to ask if someone wants to learn, but if you want to teach through a game, it better have more informative interactions because every plant is the same old story: click, click, click. Whether it's classic mode or strategy mode or even a different plant, they're all the same in this game."

Children of all ages take note; this game is based on the real science of actual botany! As your plants grow using the power of our sun, your mind grows with the power of science! There is a tutorial voice-over giving the basics of the Plantae kingdom's energy cycle, growth and development, and realistic game mechanics reinforces the lesson. This has the effect of burning the subject of plant biology into the synapses populating your temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex.SCIENCE!That's enough of that. Let's mention the gameplay.Classic mode is a real time (okay, accelerated real time) strategy plant-growth simulation. It is quite a clickfest, and is pretty punishing. It is something of a puzzle, but not so much in terms of pattern-matching and pathfinding--more of a numbers game. Players must remember the cost of each piece of plant anotomy at each stage of growth, while simultaneously collecting three resources (water, nutrients, & starch). Extra achievements are awarded for growing textbook plant morphologies, called a ""Deluxe"" plant, for each variety of seed. While you must continually work to keep your plant alive, it is not so difficult as to pose a frustrating challenge, merely a tiring one. The punishing aspects come in the form of worms which steal water (click on them to drive them away), bugs which eat leaves (click on them to squash them), blighted leaves, frozen leaves, pollinating flowers which require bees to be dragged to them. All of this requires much clicking and dragging.With inexperience, your plant will survive. With practice, it will flourish heartily enough to fruit generously. This gives you  precious points! When you get tired of Classic mode's frantic clicking, you can switch to the far more cerebral Strategy mode.Straegy mode is where Reach For The Sun really comes alive, and grows on you. It's clear much thought has gone into creating a game where players can enjoy a well-balanced experience of challenge, numerically managing their plant's resources into fruit (seed) yields to end each level. It's not a walk in the park, but you can stop and smell the roses. Each plant's own soundtrack encourages growth apace, to the tune of both peaceful and stirring music for each season of the year (mostly stringed instruments, which fits very well). The animations of leaves and flowers unfurling, of roots coiling their way through the soil are delightfully visually appealing. Bugs, bees, worms, and butterflies are present in all their splendour with their own entomogical and zooloigcal game mechanics.Reach For The Sun is wonderful game for all budding gardeners (har-hah! 'punintentional'), an experience absolutely everyone can be overjoyed by.PS: SCIENCE!!!"

And with this game they put forward an excellent example of how this would look. This small game is a little gem where every step seems to be well thought. Even the music is completely in sync with what you try to achieve.The object is simple enough, grow a plant from seedling to full grown, flower-bearing beauty as soon as possible. This can be done through two modes, classic and strategy.If classic mode you'll need to 'collect' nutrients and water through the plants roots and starch through its leaves. With these building stones you can grow more roots, leaves, stems and eventually the flowers. Watch out for bugs! They will kill your plant. After you've grown the flower it is time to attract the bees so they can pollinate your flowers and grow seeds.The seeds are used to get more plants and upgrades.In Strategy mode you have all the time in the world to finish the plant, but a limited source of nutrients.The only downside to this game is it's length. You can 'finish' the game in about two hours and then there is not much to go back too. So in conclusion I wholeheartedly recommend this game especially if this game is on sale."

I'll explain.So, you gather and spend resources and grow your flowers, science-style. That part is awesome. I absolutely love science and education mixed into games, but they are far and few between. I believe it's because it's a very difficult thing to achieve.Here you have two modes ""Classic"" and ""Strategy"". Classic is real-time as you fight against winters approach. It was very stressful! I never had time to look at the numbers and enjoy the science, i was manically pressing roots and leaves and dragging bees.But thankfully you had ""Strategy"" mode, which is turn-based and makes you plan ahead to grow your flower as best as possible in X amount of turns. Still, it didn't pose much of a challenge, at least on the easier flowers. But for me this strategic approach would be the one to go.What I'd love from a game like this was a much much slower approach. One where time wasn't really a factor apart from slowly closing in on game over. I'd love for it to have more of an ""incremental-game"" feel to it. Where i could enjoy the music and atmosphere and plan ahead and watch the progression and read up on the science as the sun slowly bathed my leaves.So, I'm afraid this wasn't quite what i hoped for. I love the idea and the science-mix, but I'd like more science, much more relaxing gameplay and a lot longer playthroughs.It would do good to learn from f.ex.""Eufloria"". But perhaps they didn't wish to go in that direction.I find it desperately hard to choose whether or not i recommend this game. I'd like to promote it because of it's idea, but the finish wasn't up to my personal hopes and standards, which makes it really hard to know what you'd like.As a review of a game, costing money I'm afraid I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down.

They should also make it to where you can survive the winter; and to where if you grow fruits over the winter they spread into more plants so you can grow a garden.

They have succeeded well in that perspective. Besides that, Reach for the Sun has a pleaseant appearance, a smooth gameplay and nice ambient music. There are also two modes: Classic; where you click your way to resources as fast as you can, and Strategy; which is turn based and thus works better for the players who need more time to read, think, and plan.Worth to mention is that the game only has support for English in case you are considering buying it for a younger gamer.The conclusion? Nothing for me, but maybe for younger players.3/10 carbohydrates"

All in all, the game does indeed inform you in short about why you are clicking parts of the plant and what the underlying processes are. But these explanations are really short and in the haste of clicking all the lit-up parts of the plant, you simply forget about what's going and in my opinion it's not necessary to know the background details to be able to play the game. Also I would have liked to get a bit more bang for the buck, as the game only took me 1.5 hours to complete (with all achievements) and the replay-ability is - again in my opinion - not really given.All in all I'd rate this with a 2 of 5, it's ok for a short, casual, clicky experience, but nothing to really learn something from and to pay money for."

Quite literally, as you have to wait for sun-ressource to spawn and then collect it.Sadly it is nothing more than a little ressource management flash game, those available online for free. The interface feels very much intended for touch controls. The clickable objects are very small and flimsy. If you are locking for a game to train your APM, this might be of interest to you."

However it ends up being a bit to fast-paced for kids to keep up.  For $5 it isn't a bad buy at all, but the limited content and the fact that it isn't quite kid-friendly makes it something that not everyone will enjoy.  It's also frustrating to deal with the small bugs - like clicking over and over on a root or leaf and getting no response."

If you manage to buy it during summer/winter sale it can be worth its price. Regular price (4,99€) is a sky-high price. It is a game from point-and-click genre. The only aim is to grow a plant and acquire seeds which are game's currency. Not an original idea..."

Overall, it is a simple concept and honestly, the game is a little too easy. It could also use more levels with different challenges, like maybe including the effects of fire or growing plants in different environments outside of a garden. The science geek inside of me loves the concept, it just seems like more time could have gone into creating more replayability and more of a challenge. That being said, I enjoyed my time playing the game, and would continue to play if any updates were to be released."
76561197993383677,Recommended,248290,15021042,"Posted: 23 March, 2015",all,boolybooly,"Pros : this fun biologically themed resource management game From Filament is an excellent educational tool for giving students an idea of how resources influence the growth of living things, exclusively plants in this game, though some principles would be transferrable to animals in a learning/ teaching context and even in a metaphorical sense to business and enterprise. It is also appropriate as a basic starting point for discussing agricultural economics with its currency of seeds gained from successful pollinations used to buy advances in plant care to improve yields on later crops. There are two modes, one is real time Classic mode and the other turn based Strategy mode. Both provide fun educational play at faster or slower paces as the player chooses. It has pleasant horticulturally paced music and appealing graphics which successfully replicate some of the beauty of living growing plants. I am glad to see this kind of game being made because creatures like ourselves learn best when we are having fun. If learning can be made into a game we all benefit and if games teach beneficial things likewise.Cons: the user interface is perfectly OK and works without any software bugs but in terms of pure gaming technicalities there are minor issues with mouse ergonomics in the Classic real time mode interface which restrict the pace of gameplay and can be frustrating. Even so it is quite possible to achieve the game goals with patience but I will detail the issues for this review. Specifically the info popups and animations for game goal achievements frequently interfere with mouse clicks used to direct gameplay in real time because they are opaque to mouse clicks so they get in the way. Also the mouse pointer graphical tooltips are a little slow to appear creating control lag and they also appear to shift the mouse pointer location marginally or delay its movement under user direction, enough to move it off target making clicking on a target an unnecessarily difficult and delayed process which is unfortunate given that the realtime game is played within fairly tight time constraints. This reduces the fluidity of gameplay which is an important aesthetic for the entertainment market and ultimately reduces the range of its appeal which could otherwise be more extensive as a zen timewaster for frugiform tech enthusiasts. Additional examples, grabbing bees for pollinating is a tricky process because some of the time they appear to be ungrabbable and the effectiveness of making a grab seems unpredictable making it a hit and miss process entirely due to the vicisstudes of the interface. In addition there is no way to prevent the presentation of certain tutorial systems which don't need to be seen twice eg the strategy mode info overlay and the sunflower tutorial mode dialogue, but these can be dismissed so are not showstoppers just minor inconveniences.With that said I thoroughly enjoyed unlocking my Deluxe Toad Lily achievement and if you enjoy games and plants you cant go wrong at this price so I recommend this game for educational purposes and botanical, horti- and agri- cultural geeks."

The game is very focused on rapid clicking and memorizing the growth pattern. Ther is no way to grow the plant your own way or to step outside the pre-determined growth format. Winning requires one optimal strategy repeated for every plant."
