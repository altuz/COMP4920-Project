,Recommended,248330,22439945,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,THE_CHOSEN_ONE,"Dino run DX is a game where you play as a little dinosaur during the apocalypse running from a giant wall of doom. You eat many things along the way such as, eggs, other little dinos and birds. You catch a ride with pterodactyls or ride giant objects or animals, and get powerups that give you a little boost. If you get destroyed from the wall of doom you lose a life sending you back to the beginning of the level, you have 3 in total. When you lose them all, you become extinct forcing you to restart from the start. There are different levels of dificulty to chose from and the game lets you customise your little dino with different hats and choices of skin colour. You can upgrade your dino after every level to increase his speed, acceleration, strength etc... Its a fun, short game and is fun for mostly younger ages, so i recomend you get a young sibling or cousing to play this as they might enjoy this a lot.I know, i only have 44 mins on this game... on steam.If i am correct, this is the first video game i have ever played. As a kid, i was bored while my parents we're working, so when my dad showed me a website called miniclip with all these cool ""Video games"" i freaked out, hell, i was scared at the idea of a video game. So i went onto the website for the first time, and like every 5 (6? can't remember that well) year old boy, I LOVED THE DINOSAURS. So when i saw the little dino i clicked on it and played. I played this game so much as a kid and when i saw this on steam,  im not gonna lie, i almost cried.For those of you who played this as a kid, on whatever website. Buy this game to support whoever made this and enjoy your own personal trip through memory lane."

76561198114413548,Not Recommended,248330,33417740,Posted: 9 July,all,zharl,"Dino DisappointmentHoo boy. This game...this gameI desperately wanted to like this game, I really did... It's not abadgame, but it's just so mediocre. I mean everything about it is just mediocre. For the sake of ease and for my own sanity, I'll try and explain what's wrong with this game by breaking it down into sections.Differences between browser version and Deluxe versionThe differences from the free version of this game are:Some minor UI changesAdditional costumesAdditional achievements and Super EggsHalloween content (five, admittedly fun, additional stages)Ability to play in full screenPersonally, I don't think this constitutes tacking on the moniker ""DX"" to Dino Run. There simply isn't enough here that differs from the orignal to justify marketing it as the delux version of the game. At least not at it's current price tag, but I'll get to that later...MovementThis game's controls are unresponsive at best and fighting the player at worse. The floaty movement of your dino combined with the wonky physics make for a thoroughly frustrating experience. Perhaps this was an intentional choice on the part of the developer, as it is highly reminiscent of the flash version. Maybe it's just me, but giving the player poor controls feels like a poor substitution for difficulty. It's one thing if that's one of the main selling points of the game (Titles likeI am Breadfor instance) but this never struck me as one of the definable characteristics of Dino Run.Options and togglingWhat you can do:Toggle going into full screenResize the window if you're not in full screenChoose your game mode (challenge or speed run)Toggle the difficultyCustomize your avatarTurn on or off various cheats and modsWhat you can't do:Customize the controlsAdjust the framerateAdjust brightness or other visual elementsTo be perfectly honest, the lack of ability to toggle video options or framerate does not bother me. This isn't a particularly processor-heavy game. That being said, neglecting to include a key mapping option irks me. Your movement choices are WASD or the arrow keys. Spacebar/escape is pause. Shift to occasionally speed up. What if I want my speed boost to be the ""E"" key? What if I want to move with the ""r"" ""j"" ""q"" and ""b"" keys for some silly reason? This may seem nitpicky, but neglecting to include this one little bit of agency for the player reeks of laziness.User InterfaceI want to stress that in listing the differences between the Deluxe and flash versions of this game I stated that there were UI changesnotUI improvements. The most noticeable change is in character customization. Rather than having to cycle through different hat choices and colors via clickable arrows, there are now 6 pages of icons to cycle through; it's not perfect but it's significantly more user friendly than it was. My favorite option of this customization menu is the auto-match feature; this matches the hat you select to a specific matching color combination for your dino. This is what was done right.Now for what was done wrong:None of the outfits have names listed, as such you can't search for anything by keyword. Apparently I've unlocked theSpeed RacerandSmall Pumpkinhats. Which ones are they? I have some guesses, but I couldn't definitively tell you. So apparently the hats have names, the player just can't see what they are.The list of hats can be organized into three possible categories: Classic, Indie, or Halloween. These options serve to sort the entire collection of hats in a different order depending on your category of choice. Where does one category end and another start? I couldn't say, as there are no descriptions. Also, I hope you like the hats, because once you pick one, you're wearing a hat. You can no longer go hatless. Maybe my dino's scalp is especially susceptable to sunburn or something.MultiplayerIt's a ghost town. Multiplayer essentially doesn't exist.Single PlayerIt's short and quickly gets boring. Yeah there are other worlds but the Halloween world is short (albeit a fun 7 minute romp through crazy) and Planet D is unplayable without having full stats.Game modesChallenge or speedrun are your choices. Challenge follows the harrowing journey the harrowing journey that your Dino must undergo to reach shelter facing the end of the world. Speed run lets you choose between a selection of 24 levels with different weird twists to run through. Does one game mode sound more robust than the other? That's because it is. Speed run is a fun gimmick for maybe 20 minutes. Challenge mode has a life span of a few hours at most. While neither is packed to the brim with content, the challenge mode brings a bit more to the table.Improving your dinoYou can choose to upgrade speed, jump, acceleration, and strength. This is identical to the flash version. There was so much potential here. The developer could have expanded this upgrade tree and allow the player to go for different builds.  Maybe there would be more of a multiplayer community if the ability customization was a third as robust as the appearance customization options. Right now, its just a battle of numbers (assumming stats factor in, when playing multiplayer; I don't know since I can't find an opponent). Also, there is nothing to indicate what these different attributes do. I have a pretty good grasp of the first three (speed, acceleration, and jump), but strength? I think Boulders knock me around less or something? Like the other area of customization, the options lack explanation and make the players choices lack meaningRewards and incentives for playingDNA and bones. DNA lets you improve your stats and bones are currency...I guess. Bones allow you to purchase the levels in speedrun mode, so that you can actually play in speedrun mode. To be blunt it feels like forced content, but that's kind of how I feel about Speed Run mode as a whole. DNA is slow to come and a grind to get. There are a few achievements [called milestones] that award the player with DNA, but the big boons for DNA are finding the various Super-eggs strewn across the levels. Even with collecting these milestones and collectables, the player is still required to run the same levels over and over to try and improve their dino before they can even think about playing on higher difficulties. This gets old quickly. Even though things are ""Procedurally generated"" some two runs certainly feel the same, despite what the game claims. Different screens may be strewn together to create levels, but the choices feel limited and tend to blend together, regardless of which portions of a level spawn and regardless of sequence. I have a sneaking suspicion that ""Speedrun"" may be a glorified level select with some added wonky game features.Final wordsI have more that I could say. A lot more, but character limitations prevent that. The worst part is, I'm a fan of Pixeljam! I've had a lot of fun with Gamma Bros, Rat mazes 1 and 2, and the browser version of Dino Run. I just was expecting more from a title with a $5.99 price tag. Six bucks may not sound like a lot, but I don't necessarilyhavea lot to throw around. If this game were $1.99, I'd be more forgiving. I made this purchase because I wanted to support Pixeljam and I had high hopes for how they may have improved this game. Unfortunately, I'll have to file this one under ""regret."" I'll return to it and play it some more, but it's sad to see my Dino exist in a perpetual state of mediocrity."

,Recommended,248330,34584829,Posted: 29 August,all,draco21799,"I used to love to play this game as a kid, and when I heard that there was a downloadable version, I had to get it. It's everything I remember and more.Gameplay is very simple. You're a dino, and you're trying to avoid the impending apocalypse, all the while collecting eggs and munching critters. By collecting the eggs and critters, you get upgrade points (DNA) to make your dino faster and stronger. It's a very simple system, although it can take quite a while to get all the DNA you want for the last few upgrades.There's also two main gamemodes, the campaign and speedruns. The campaign has you move through several levels with limited lives. The speedruns have some gimmick attached, and you get one try or you're forced to restart. This version has more than the original browser game, and removed some that were somewhat unfair/boring.The multiplayer works relatively well, and can be done with traditional gameplay or can be treated as a sandbox to mess around in. I haven't done too much of it but it works.Controls are tight. You can run, jump, and crouch. You also have a activatable speed boost. The boost can upgrade depending on how much DNA you get, allowing the player to make some harder jumps or get up a hill faster. The difficulty is well balanced in all but a few speedruns on Intense difficulty and Intense Campaign, but if you're a good player and playing with a maxed out dino, it's managable with either a good seed or game knowledge.There's plenty of achievements if that's your cup of tea, and the really catchy soundtrack can be unlocked by collecting a secondary currency called ""Bones"" (that also unlocks the speedruns).The only complaints I have is that the game doesn't make the boost apparent to you unless you read the instructions (silly I know, but some people just skip by it assuming the game to be simple). Additionally, the physics engine can be a bit wonky. Sometimes some jumps get gimped because the slope is slightly angled, and there are a few spots in a few select seeds and levels where a rock or an enemy dino can push you through the floor (don't worry though, if you do, the game will let you fall for a while and you'll teleport to the top of the world).All in all, this game is a great runner. With great gameplay, great music, functioning multiplayer, and lots of vanity options, it brought me back to my childhood playing it on the web. I can guarantee you'll be having a great time escaping the apocalypse, just like I did."

76561198025604634,Recommended,248330,21898660,"Posted: 17 March, 2016",all,starkwolf,"Dino Run is life: You run straight forward as fast as you can to escape all the perils and there is no guarantee that you will survive. Orr maybe it is just a dumb flash game moved to Steam for some mindess enjoyment. When you are done, your reward is more running until you die a natural death doom catches up with you. Somehow a natural death is still more preferable, trust me, you don't want the doom.Jokes aside, I will offer a short practical review, and a longer more picked apart analysis.Practically, this game has a tiny community, but each match is short and since matches are managed by a host, you can start with anywhere from 2-6 players depending on interest. Often it will be just 2 or 3, as that will be the entirety of players in the lobby. No link to steam accounts*, so you will have to make your own Xgen account. This is a pixel game with simple controls that anyone that can play Super Mario Bros. can pick up with ease, albeit learning what does what, while optional, is helpful in regards to the plants. The cost... well it is a browser game so play it on the Xgen website and then make up your mind whether you want to get the Steam version.On a deeper level, I was only half-joking about my first paragraph. While I doubt that was the intended effect, the game does feel rather dark and pessimistic at times for those that care about the ambience, pessimistic in a way that reflects reality. A sense of one's very survival being so fleeting that there is no time to live, only time to fear doom. Such is adult life, and such it has been since the beginning of mankind. The music and atmousphere can be anywhere from mildly inviting to outright depressing. Of course, I doubt most players will really notice or be concerned about this part.*This has been changed. You can now log in with your Steam account."

Unfortunately, not to me. I can understand this game has some ""retro"" value for those who had played the original flash game at early age, but for newcomers, the game has pretty much nothing to offer. Gameplay is very, very simple and it didn't get me addicted at all. I don't mind the poor C64 graphics and music that much since I grew up on that era, but in this game, its too artificial without any lets say, style. Controls are also quite poor and the dino just doesn't jump and move very accurately or responsively. Surely that was the case in C64 era but today, I won't let it slide easily. 15 minutes of gameplay and you have pretty much seen it all. Will I ever return to play this? Maybe, because at least it loads fast and runs in windowed mode as default. It's quick to start and quick to close. Perhaps this is a good game while you are waiting some big file transfer to complete or something but I've played much more addicting and better indie games like, lets say Limbo or Obulis that were definitely worth that 2€."

I've had 15 hours of play in the last 2 days, so that sort of shows how much of a nerd I am.

I've played the original online version, the SE version, and of course the DX version. All bringing improvements and additions while maintaing the classic same core game. Easy to pick up, each level takes less than a few minutes and can be something fun to breaze through. Some challenges and higher difficulty end-levels can give you a run for your money though, even with a fully upgraded dino! A simple game, but plenty of features to keep things interesting for a while. Well worth the price, sale or not."

I've known this game since it was only in browser version, then bought the SE version when it came out... and then, a couple of years later, i think that it's been a long time since i've last heard of this game, and i go check out again, and guess what i see : BOOM, Dino Run DX. ON SALE, more than that. I buy it (almost no hesitation), play it : turned out bringing me a great taste of childhood nostalgia plus the excitment of an improved version of a game that was already fun and addictive back when it was just a browser game.So yeah, REALLY worth the cost ! It's fun, addictive, it has multiplayer, simple yet beautiful retro graphics, and enough challenges and content to last a good while (and HATS. FREE HATS). Tem at a tem, would totally recommend."

,Recommended,248330,22914540,"Posted: 11 May, 2016",all,Chancer,"Six bucks is a bit hefty for a small little flash game like this, and truth be told, I think a lot of my personal bias goes towards this game since I have incredibly fond memories of this game as a 5th-7th grader playing it.  A decade later and in several years into college, it brought a smile to my face to play it once more with the fantastic soundtrack and clunky mechanics, same as before.  Bringing back old memories like that alone is well worth the cost for me.  I will say however it does convey the frantic run away from the wall of doom very well, more so than most games I've played.However, if you haven't played this before, there's truthfully not much going for it.  It's a simple, straightforward runner game that's probably worth the dosh below the price listed currently.  Still, you can tell the game has a lot of heart.  The cute animations, the simplistic yet effective mechanics, and in my opinion, a pretty amazing soundtrack despite how small it is.  It was original and punchy.  Loved it."
