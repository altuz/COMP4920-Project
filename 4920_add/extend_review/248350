The only problem I have is that no-one is ever online, when it came out there was a fair amount of people online but now there are hardly any! D: The concept of the game is brilliant and i great even for small children (though I am not of their number). The game is displayed in a type of 3D-ish GTA 1/2 style. Whilt there is only one gametype you can still have fun without completing the objective or playing as Omegalodon, instead you can have races across the fairly large map, aerial dogfights, trying to blow up every structure etc. I highly recommend that you play thi game, whilst it doesn't have many players now I believe there should a lot more people playing this wonderful game.I can never give a game a core of ten out of ten but shall give it a score of 8.5/10"

Well Debra, Simone, the Internet, let's get down to it.Pros:- the gameplay. Simple, and so much fun. Either shoot stuff, smash stuff, or grab a Boeing and just plain fly like the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Delta Airlines ever employed.- the concept. Do you want to be a shark? Hell yes you do. Do you want to be a giant shark on steroids that can make glitter bombs that can seriously mess with every Boeing within a quarter mile? Hell yes you do. Do you want to be a little man who runs around and shoots that giant shark with a 9mm pistol?!? Probably not! But do it anyways.- the graphics. Lush, beautiful graphics like these need to be seen by all! What with all the... squares... and rectangles. Seriously, it's simple. So you can play it with pretty much anything. No, not you Celeron users.Cons:- the devs. Literally no sound from them. Are they still working on this? Who knows. Do they even know how awesome this game is doing? Probably not. Are they still alive, or were they some of the people you shot in the airport in that Modern Warfare 2 scene? Yeah, it was like 28 seconds in. You shot them.- the world. I think custom maps could really help this game out. Walking down the same path every time gets kinda lame. Imagine a world where there are MORE TREES. Can you even do that? I hope so.- the shark. He's got limited attacks. Like more limited than Apple's range of devices in 2010. It's either smash RIGHT in front of you, or the glitter bomb which is all around you. I think a freakin' laser beam on his forehead would help significantly.Summary:Buy it. Play it. Get the devs back over here so that we see some new content. It's a good game and it deserves your money."

,Recommended,248350,20334006,"Posted: 5 January, 2016",all,TurtleSquared,"This game is a prime example of why a developer really needs to listen to his/her game's community.The developer for Omegalodon, North Of Earth (NOE), gave up on this game. No updates, no bug fixes, no anything. We dont even know if he/she is still ALIVE. Also, due to the one gamemode, this game gets old very fast. There just isn't an incentive to play it. The servers don't fill out, half of those servers are being run on a pirated copy of the game so they aren't compatible with the steam version, and worst of all, is that there is no real ways to enhance teamwork or something to that sort.Like I stated before, there isn't an incentive to play it. For example, I have Omegalodon in my 'Favorites' category in my Steam Library. I see it, and once and a while go, ""Well that is a candidate..."" and then see something like Rocket League, or CS:GO and go ""Well........those are a bit more varied and fun."" It's all about the fact that 'North Of Earth just flat out gave up on this game.And that doesn't mean that this is a bad game! This game is incredible! If you have friends that own it and play it often, buy it! This is a great game to not only have, but to play when you really don't have time for other games. It launches pretty quickly, doesnt load much, hasNAT PUNCHTHROUGH(That's geek talk for ""you dont have to be a geek to host a server"") and is pretty fun on the surface. However, If you don't have friends to play with, or the willpower/finances to make them play with you, I would suggest you look past it. Get it on sale, or something to that effect. I give the game a 8.9/10, and the developer's community interaction, a 2/10."

,Not Recommended,248350,24147237,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,{Toasty}Taoistdragon,"This is a game I wanted to love so much but saddly it falls short on a few important things.  That is not to say that the game is not enjoyable as it is.  As an open world sandbox where you can drive any vehicle and destory every building it is quite enjoyable.  However several design flaws keep the main game from being as fun as it could be.  The main issue is balancing, or lack of.  Omegalodon is the most weak pathetic excuse for a giant monster there ever was.  He is slow, his attacks don't do as much damage as they should, and his health constantly drains.  This makes it so if it was a one v one game you automaticly lose as Omegalodon because you can't overcome the health drain and the humans can just easliy keep out of reach.  This is because humans are stupidly fast.  In fact they are faster than cars on foot, making any vehicle that isn't a helicopter or jet just about useless.  Even tanks are iffy as they are just slow.  However this isn't as bad for me as the fact like I mentioned before that humans can easily avoid Omegladon's attacks just because they are faster than him.  If it was that way in a vehicle I would understand but no even on foot they out run the beast.  This just makes it easy to pelt him with bullets and avoid counterattack because minus a mistake you can easliy avoid his attacks, even Omegalodon's aoe attack.  Also about that aoe attack, that is Omegladon's only defense agains air craft and you can just fly over his head safely out of reach.   This means Omegladon NEEDS his human teammates to win and that sucks.  For one the game doesn't autobalance so if no one wants to play on Omegladon's side he's screwed.  For another thing his teammates can heal him counteracting his natural drain, but only while on foot.  This means they are unable to again deal with aircraft cause on foot you can't shoot them so in order to fight them you can't be healing Omegladon.  So what this pretty much means is that Omegalodon's side is balanced only when more people are on his side than the soldier's team.  If they just did some number changes made it so humans on foot were slower than Omelgadon, lowered or removed the health drain, gave Omelgadon a chance to fight back, this game would be great.  However in it's current condtion it's just a sad dissapointment.  I do still think the game is fun to goof around in and treat like a sandbox game, at least when everyone is human."

The game has cute graphics, with good controls, and fun vehicles to use. Omegalodon is a fun little game to play. However, multiplayer has always been dangerously low on players, which has always threatened to cause Omegalodon to be a dead game, and replayability is not extremely high.

Some (crazed) woman who cares about the eco-system and things like that is talking to Omegalodon and telling him what to do. The Eco warriors must help Omegalodon by killing the enemies and healing it. The enemies, which are the police and the military, must defeat Omegalodon in any way possible. Is the plot good? It is easy to understand, and it makes the game simple. I give the plot of this game a 7/10 since it isnt THAT exciting of a plot.Weapons and VehiclesI admit, you have a really good range of vehicles.... and there isn't much on the ""weapons"" side. Your weapon decides on what class you play. For example, the soldiers have rocket launchers. Most of the time, people will use vehicles against the Omegalodon. Its sometimes a race against teammates to get the cooler vehicles, for example, the ""space ship"" or the Boeings. Personally, I like using the space ship when I get the chance, and I like using the freighters to block the road (Didn't think of that, did you, other players)! Anyway, I give this a 9/10 because the weapons just dont seem that great.Community, Developers and UpdatesOh god.... this is where the game entirely falls to shame. First off, the developers have given up on this great game! No more updates come out! Second of all, there are many owners of this game who LOVE it, but barely play it for one reason. That reason is the dead community. It is too hard to find active games at this time, and nobody barely even touches this game nowadays. If the developers realised the love for this game and gave it more updates (for example, bots or more interactive things), it could be a really great and popular game!.... Sadly, I would love to give this section a higher score, but I sadly have to go with a 2/10.Is this game worth getting?Lets be honest. At this time, no. Its a really bad choice to get. Its too dead to be a fun game. If the developers updated the game, and more and more people bought it and started playing it.... then I would easily recommend it. But at this time, I'd stay away from it. Overall, I give this game a 5/10."

Although I had the most popular server before when the game was not popular, as it is now, i wish more people would join, mainly because saying it was the most popular server is true, i would only have about 8 people on at a time. So maybe add a single player mode?"

The sky limit thingB. More mapsC. More vehicles or singleplayer support (Tutorials, training etc..)"

76561198025470758,Not Recommended,248350,16478222,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,"Void, the Violet Knight","WARNING. If you 1) Like playing games with other people that are MMO, 2) Run Mac or Linux and don't want to be told to buy a $500 laptop to play the game, or 3) Mind being kicked after being better than other people at the game, don't buy this game. The creators of the game obviously didn't care enough about the community at the beginning of this game, because it was labeled for every system when it was only Windows, so right now I have $10 less in my pocket for absolutely nothing. I reported that a short while ago. They also apparently don't care about actually getting the game going, so they don't warn you that there are very few people who ever play the game. Both the positive and negative reviews say that much, other than Godzilla, who's a friend of the creators and wants to funnel your money into their pockets.Then, there's the gameplay issues. I've seen quite a few people try to play this game on Youtube, as well as heard rants from some of my friends. According to my sources, being an Environmentalist sucks, due to not really being able to fight other players very well. ALl they can do is sit by Omegalodon and hold down that heal button until they get exploded by a jet. The second issue is, everyone either wants to A) Be a missile shooting helicopter, or B) be Omegalodon, so being Omegalodon sucks, because you'll always have the bulk be against you, and then, there's ANOTHER issue I've seen happen in Let's Plays, and screenshares from friends; with most of the ""community"" that plays, if you're too much better than them, they kick you. So the few people there are tend to be ragers. In my opinion? This game sucks. Don't buy it. it's a waste of money no matter how many sales they put on it, and it's not worth your time. Go read through all of the other reviews, positive and negative. I promise you the only one who didn't complain about anything is the one on the game makers' team.EDIT: Notice that all the positive reviews don't say the game in a whole is good. Just the idea is, and I agree with that, but no one wants to live in a broken-down shack on a sound base."
