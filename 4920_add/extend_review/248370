There is no right or wrong way to complete a level. In fact, every level is open-ended, although it never feels like I'm at a loss for what to do due to a very good difficulty curve, yet at the same time increasingly challenging requirements. Levels are bite-sized, so the game could easily be enjoyed during a short break, and toward higher difficulties requirements and resources tend to vary more and more ensuring that there is no collapse to a single working design.This is not the most graphically gorgeous game, nor does it provide the most extensive simulation, but neither is really needed to properly exercise the brain in the regions other than the overstimulated run/aim/shoot reflexes. And should your destructive needs be overwhelming, there is nothing like collapsing an enormous steel and iron structure, watching the passenger train on top of it plummet to its doom.Well worth the sale price, runs on pretty much any computer, and is a great amount of fun."

More like an extended tutorial really. Once you hit medium and hard the challange starts. Build a bridge with a limmited set of parts, on a budget. Have the bridge survive trains, or cars, or earthquakes. Some even have to open hydraulicly for steamboats to pass. Pretty cool to make a bridge on budget, and holds up the train, just to get torn down by the shipping. Where the game starts to fall short is that once played, there is no reset to start over once a bridge is built in a specific challenge, and there are only about 24 challenges in total. I played most in about 3 hours. Further, many of the hardest challenges are indeed not possible to complete as you are tasked to construct a bridge that does not connect to land on one or both sides, and the test vehicle, usually a train, just nose dives off the cliff and the simulation fails. I don't believe these were play tested in advance. Also, you can not build past the budget, and then reduce the design, once you are out of money, no further experiments can be made. Would be a really good $2 or $5 game, but for $19.99 I expected much more."

This game is a pretty traditional and well made bridge builder overall. It has a finished touch with a good user interface and alright graphics. Physics are mostly as they should be, although a few times some trucks fell through the road, but on the other hand those bridges were a bit crazy design anyway. There are some basic levels and then there are challenging ones. Level design can get almost surprisingly clever in some levels.I have a kind of long history with bridge building games and I know when I see a good one. If you have too, Bridge It would be an excellent purchase."

You begin the game with only iron then steel.. as you progress through the levels you gain access/unlock more building materials allowing you to span greater distances etc... graphics and lighting are descent in this game, and can be altered without ""waiting for time to change"".  Features such as stress / load / environmental tests are fun to play with.  Triggering a 7.0 earthquake for example is a fun way to usually watch your creation decimated in a split second ιllιlı.  My experience was over-all o.k..  I had some issues with controls/getting click features to respond accurately while building which slowed down the pace of the game.  I don't see much activity regarding updates/patches, and the last ""news"" on the STEAM HUB was posted in NOV2013.  I recommend this game for casual play if you just want to mess around with another ""physics/construction"" game ... BUT at @ half the price it is currently listed for on the Steam store.http://store.steampowered.com/app/248370"
,Recommended,248370,31346223,Posted: 24 April,all,wowhub,"When I play a game I want it to make me work for every milestone in it. If a game has to give you an achievement every five seconds to keep you playing it then it is not worth your time. That is what I love about this game. It starts you in some fairly simple levels where you can get to grips with the controls. Then in the harder stages of the game it takes more and more thought to make a bridge that is under budget and that looks nice. In the world of bridge building simulators this one stands out for it is not like some that have levels that take a few seconds and you're done. You actually have to plan out how each bridge is going to deliver the vehicle ""safely"" to the other sides. Some require a lot of out of the box plans, but they leave you with a great feeling of success after making the bridge work. It was one of my first buys on steam and gave me hours of enjoyment."

The higher levels are goofy, not at all realistic for a physics type game. Having a bridge that is only connected on one side of a ravine is realistic where again? I liked the challenge of the first bunch of levels but then you get to the hard levels and all you can do is scratch your head because it's way out there. If I were eligible for a refund, I'd ask for it, game was NOT worth my money."

76561198079330275,Recommended,248370,31600201,Posted: 7 May,all,jacobellinger,My friend who loves action type games confessed his interest in this game. I was shocked and confused because it's well outside what I thought he liked. I decided to try it out after he would not shut up about how adictive the game is. . . .he is not wrong. Very suprisingly fun and adictive. Frustrating at times but that feeling when you get a bridge to work is like nothing I've felt from a game for YEARS! I will say however as you'll see by the hours I put in that the game is VERY fun but I blasted through about 80% of the content in less than 10 hours and the other 20 was so hard it stopped being fun. I'm happy to have just beat hard mode.

,Recommended,248370,33409020,Posted: 9 July,all,hitsman4u,This game will keep you occupied for quite some length of time even though at times it appears to feature some dodgy game physics. A real case of think think think ... Where at times the clues are in the lie of the land. By far the toughest challenges feature having to build a steel / iron bridge across the desert canyon which in easier challenges is best bridged using a suspension bridge. There are bonus levels available to unlock as you progress through the game though there is no sandbox / free play mode available with which you would be able to test your own designs and creations (or contraptions!) The graphics options are excellent and the game is played in fullscreen mode. My verdict ... It's a 4/5 for sure on this one only let down at times by bizarre game physics meaning that some times bridges which collapse actually hold up allowing you to pass onto the next level!
,Not Recommended,248370,33570935,Posted: 15 July,all,ferox96,"used to work fine.  Tried recently and was unable to simulate/test any bridge beyond the physics before a train passes.  Waited 20 minutes at double speed and no train ever showed.In short, game is broken."
