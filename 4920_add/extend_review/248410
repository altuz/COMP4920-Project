I played a little bit of the beta, and liked where it was going, but now it appears to have stopped going anywhere. I made a mistake, one that I'll learn from in this new age of crowd funded Indie games, but I'll get to that in a moment.First, I don't think was a scam, even if I do think continuing to sell it might be. I think the developers actually did have every intention of fully developing this product, you can see that by the work that went into the product as it exists. But, the developers made a mistake themselves early on that more or less doomed the project.My mistake was not checking the history of the game, seeing how it was funded, and what that looked like. Turns out it was a crowd funded game, and upon further investigation they appear to have not ask for nearly enough cash to keep the project going. That is only my opinion, but the stated goals are fairly ambitious for $35K in funding.I'm sad it didn't come to fruition and wish the developers the best in their future endeavors. Because, I imagine that this was even more disappointing to them than it was to the supporters."

,Not Recommended,248410,8701138,"Posted: 13 January, 2014",all,ilcontegis [Linux],"Probably one of the worst game I have ever played.High retail price of 30$ (the real price should be 5-8$) and buggy, it looks like an uncompleted work.It is clear that devs went far over their possibilities with kickstarter, trying to do too much. The result is a game which potentially could be a good rpg but in reality is a fiasco. The skill system is totally useless and repetitive, graphics is old and ugly and the crafting system (which could be pretty interesting) is unbalanced and poorly refined. Moreover quests are boring and repetitive, mobs looks all the same, etc etc. It is probably the first time ever I have nothing good to say about a game.What I hate most about this game is that devs lied upon release promizing features which were never there. This is false advertizing, I hope this things will be punishable one day.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
,Not Recommended,248410,11705355,"Posted: 14 August, 2014",all,LunarCircle,"I purchased this because I enjoy RPGs and adventure games in general, and this seemed to have both of those elements. Unfortunately, the final impression was pretty underwhelming. Legends of Aethereus isn't a bad game, but it's not that good either. For me, this title fell into the mediocre category pretty quickly.Pros:I loved the environments. While not too highly detailed, they were well fleshed out and large. I especially enjoyed the forest areas with all of the greenery and lush vegetation.The character growth features a nice system where there are six main attributes sectioned into three pairs and displayed on progression bars. Each attribute has a complementary one on the bar that prevents you from maxing out every stat. For example: filling up the strength/agility bar with points in strength prevents your character from being agile. It's a nice system that allows for specialization instead of overpowered characters.The skill trees are also quite large and feature a lot of skills to obtain and expand upon.Cons:While the environments were well-made, the character and costume models, unfortunately, were not. Character textures are flat and dull with the characters themselves not being pretty lifeless. I suppose it's just a gripe of mine, but I would've expected a bit more detail on the character models considering how much better the environments look.The fighting engine is quite simple. The game's website boasts of a physics-based fighting system, but so far in my playthrough, combat just boiled down to dodging to the side and swinging  your weapon (I've only played a melee character, so ranged attacks might be different). Enemies aren't that bright, either. They'll detect you and then just perform one attack the majority of the time.Regarding enemies, there are some areas where they spawn indefinitely. It can get pretty frustrating when attempting to pick up a quest item or some loot and enemies keep on coming. Most of the time, there isn't a musical change that signals an attack, so you can get surprised from time to time. It's not that big of an issue, but I get the impression that unlimited waves of enemies were used to create tension, but they instead end up being a point of frustration.Quests are extremely simple. So far, everything I've experienced has basically been: go to a certain place, fight some enemies, get an item or wait out an attack, then return and collect your reward.Crafting is also simple with few different armor models. Most of the armor looks the same with maybe an extra texture or armor piece added. Though I've only seen the Tier I armor and weapons and tiers II and III may have more different kinds.All in all, I wanted to like Legends of Aethereus as it seemed like a good entry in the adventure-RPG genre, but it turned out to be quite underwhelming. It's good if you want something quick to do, but at this point, that's about it. Perhaps the developer is working on more content and updating the gameplay engines somewhat, but until that happens, I would say to hold off on it."

,Not Recommended,248410,8032921,"Posted: 13 December, 2013",all,Yeti,"I'm going to start off with this is a fun game. The combat I find well done, but still a little clunky. It constists of a lot of blocking, parrying, and dodging. There's a decent variety of enemies and they are creative and fun to fight, and a bit of a challenge with the flank-loving AI. The graphics are pretty nice, and the mission setup is kinda cool. The weapon/armor creation and customization is really fun to toy with and create new things for first few hours. Character customization isn't all that bad either, and the armor and weapons look nice aethestically. I found it fun for a few hours, a bit more with the easy set up Co-op with a friend. Lastly, this game is not dead. The devs are still working on it, and may end up changing or fixing what I have mentioned. It has recieved a few patches since purchase.On to the cons for Legends of Aethereus. The skill tree is mediocore. It looks very vast, but it consists of a few skills with just a bunch of shallow upgrades. The skills themselves aren't very interesting either. The map seems quite small, and many different areas reuse very large chunks of terrains and models, and makes many areas seem very very similar. The weapon and armor creation seems vast at first, but I later realized it's quite simple and a bit shallow. You run out of things to make fast, and Crafting is the only way to find decent weapons and armor. It consists of making the same things over and over, but just changing the material it is made out of, to make it more effective. The game is very buggy and poorly optimized. There are memory leaks that can bring even great systems to its knees over time which can really kill the experience. The game overall has a cheap feel, which is to be expected with a small studio indie game.Tl;DR - Personally, I would not recommend the game. There is fun to be had, and I'm sure there are people out there who would enjoy this game. There are, however, flaws,bugs, and lack of depth in the game that should be pointed out and considered before throwing $30 on this game."

,Not Recommended,248410,7830570,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,"Dosbilliam, Boring But Practical","Short version: Go download Vindictus. It'll give you pretty much the same mechanics, just with smoother combat, better crafting, vendors that can actually upgrade your equipment, intuitive character stats, a simpler damage/armor system, and Vindictus just generally does everything better.Long version: This is probably the worst game I've played that wasn''t outright broken like Hydrophobia. The easiest way to get me to stop playing your game is to have terrible combat for the genre, and this game completely misses the mark, being at least 3 steps worse than the standard Bethesda combat, which is the stiffest I had seen before buying this game. My recommendation for Vindictus is because that's the closest game I can think of to this, although comparing it to this game is an insult to said MMO. The combat is done the same way, just minus any combos, smooth character movement, or any real combat quality whatsoever. The crafting system has potential, but the materials seem to have essentially no drop pattern whatsoever, thus rendering any chance of being able to make something GOOD for your level entirely up to chance. The quest system, and transportation to the areas for the quests is what made me first think of Vindictus, and this seems to be the only part of the game done with any actual quality, since it does something Vindictus DOESN'T do, by only showing the areas you need to go for your active quests. This is literally the only game I've seriously thought about trying to get a refund for, since I knew Hydrophobia was going to be broken going in, I enjoyed Colonial Marines because I went in thinking it was going to be the FPS version of the previous title named, and I haven't tried Magicka on a desktop yet which is where it apparently works best. The graphics are alright, but so the graphics in Vindictus, so save yourself the money and just download that...even if the game is closer to P2W than F2P."

You'll meet some other kooky characters along the way, such as Leonidas of Ireland, the Clown who hides from gay people and Kim Jong Un! I rate this 99/100, but only because the A.I is too advanced for me."

Like your time is better spent playing Duke Nukem Forever. Or My Little Pony on DS. Don't buy this. I don't care if it goes on sale for $.01 it's not a smart buy. However, somehow I have twisted my mind into enjoying campy, awful and just puke-bad RPG's. From that aspect, it's hilarious."

That being said this game STINKS! I tried it for awhile and feel I cannot waste anymore time. I havent played it since I got it in a sale like a year ago and even onsale for I think like 10 bucs or something like that I still felt ripped off..thankfully I didn't pay full price when it came out.."

The combat is clunky and you are made to lunge forward with every attack making it challenging to hit people and the class system is railed hard with no guidance at all. The only redeeming quality is the crafting system that is very customizable. wasted my $30 on this garbage
