For example, there is a section with a memory-type puzzle, where you have to step on a grid of tiles in the correct sequence to pass. However, the floor is completely dark, so you can't even tell which tile you're standing on. Even if you've memorized the sequence, you still have to make leaps of faith in the darkness and hope you land on the right tile.If it takes you 2 hours to solve a puzzle that could be solved in 10 seconds with the lights on, that's a pretty poorly designed puzzle."

The player's character is never put in any real danger.The game is dark. I mean really dark. It's like they didn't want you to see anything. They even did that ""film grain"" thing a lot of dev teams do in order to gloss over the fact they copied and pasted most of the level, and are using generic textures. Darkness isn't scary if there's nothing in it.The puzzles are extremely simple. There are unnecessary slow-paced parkour sections ... just because why not. The most interesting thing to do is searching for collectibles just to get an achievement. Lame.That being said, the atmosphere is alright.

The devs are almost non-interactive, and it's been almost a year since this game came out with the promise that people who bought this would get chapters 3 & 4 free when they were released. This isn't the case now, and had I know that I wouldn't have paid this price for the game. As beautiful as it is, it's not worth the price for half a game riddled with glitchyness. Not to mention the devs removing/locking threads which are unfavourable. If you can find it super cheap, grab it up for sure, but don't hope for anything past chaptesr 1 & 2. Real disappointed in these guys."

Area 2 involves walking from place to place in order, picking up notes. Area 3 involves walking round and round in circles assembling bits of broken machinery.There is no action. You have no weapons. You can't run from anything that threatens you - you either have to avoid it or face it.Not only is it a DULL, DULL game with absolutely NOTHING of interest happening, the devs aren't interested in patching it. They've known about bugs and glitches for months but are too busy stealing money from people with ""Chapter 3"".Oh yes. If you haven't heard, this was an Early Access game. Parts 1&2 were released initially, with the rest of the game to follow when it was done. Not only have they not bothered fixing what was broken with parts 1&2, but they've decided they're entitled to charge for the rest of the game. So anybody who helped them by buying Early Access now has to pay again to get the game they've already paid for.Even if the game was amazing I wouldn't recommend it, simply because this sort of behaviour should NOT be encouraged."

You play as the protagonist known as Thomas Foster. An Agent that was assigned to track down criminals and psychotics.  The game plays in set chapters and has an auto save feature.

I even made you a list!-The tutorial level is unbelievably laggy compared to the rest of the game, maybe because the entire level loaded at once.-Walk in the dark, pick up a thing, rinse and repeat. We're getting GOTY with these revolutionary mechanics.-Jump scares are substituted for things that could actually be scary, you know, like a story.-When the level loads a different area, there is no loading screen, the game cuts to black and fades back. It feels jagged.-Some parts are just way too dark. Even with the gamma turned up, you won't be able to discern different symbols in front of you, symbols which will determine if you live or become a giant shishkabob.But don't add this to your cart and delete it from your cart yet! This game has some redeeming factors!-The setting is great, really. The maps aren't the most creative, but they serve their purpose well when they aren't dark.-The sound is fun. It will make you feel as if there's someone around you or even BEHIND YOU RIGHT NOW! AAAHH!!-Because it's a standard horror game, they don't waste time introducing quirky mechanics you'll use once and then never again. It takes 5 minutes for hem to teach you what you need to know and you're off.-The first ""monster"" you come across (and the only one I've seen so far) has a pretty basic design, but still manages to be freaky after seeing it 500 times.I'd only recommend this game to people who like horror games and only if they want something a little lighter. The story won't give you existential depression, the monsters won't give you nightmares, you won't have to sleep between mommy and daddy when you finish Chapter 1, it's a very relaxed horror game."

Doorways: Chapters 1 & 2 (now called Doorways: Prelude, apparently) is an exploration, puzzle solving horror game, that relies on darkness to confound you, while playing as a character who is after people in some alternate dimension.Unfortunately, it doesn’t do much well.It’s yet another horror title in what is seemingly becoming a bigger and bigger genre.ProsGraphics are decentVoice acting is surprisingly good for a low budget indie horror gameImagery is astounding, from the torture dungeon to the malformed humansIt’s over quick and has easy achievements if you’re an achievement hunterConsFar, far too dark; darkness is excellent in a horror game, this one just uses it excessivelyPuzzles are extremely easy, made harder by the near pitch blackness (I rarely turn my monitor brightness up; this game had me increasing it both from within game and the actual monitor controls)Not much to the environments, they’re all pretty basicInventory system is clunkyChapter 1’s torch is the most useless torch in the history of gaming, whether by design or anotSummaryDoorways: Prelude has a few things going for it, with some genuinely disturbing imagery at parts, but it’s overall another sub-par horror game, that relies on complete blackness to make its easy puzzles harder. I completed it in roughly 80 minutes, with the remainder of my time played allowing the game to run to get the final two card drops.I picked this up in a bundle at some point along the way, and for the price, it was well worth it. I wouldn’t suggest buying this on its own, unless you’re very hard up for a horror game. But if you’re hard up for a horror game, there are, literally, hundreds of other titles far more deserving of your cash."

It's mostly a cinematic experience, rather than a game with any real challenge. There are puzzles and a few jump scares but really the mechanics won't push you too hard. It's more about feeling kind of spooked by the atmosphere and the content. You'll get bored with it after a while; I didn't even finish it."
76561198294715378,Recommended,248470,29914470,Posted: 13 February,all,BladeDraconis,"Read a lot of reviews and finally decided to jot a few lines. I understand that many are frustrated because this game was listed under survival and I can see why. Yet if you think about it, anything where you would have to try and not get killed can be classified as such (I personally would classify Prelude as more of a stealth game... but then again, not exactly).For those who gave it a thumbs down simply because ""it wasn't scary enough"" remember - just because it didn't scare you, does not mean it didn't scare anyone else. What DO you find scary? Seeing someone being sliced in half with their guts all over the place? Stupid in my opinion. Or having to check yourself every once and again because you feel like someone's following you? Because that's what Prelude (or any Doorways game) is in essence.I felt so immersed in the atmosphere and the score that I had to turn around to see if anyone was behind me. Sometimes I would simply walk around just to LOOK around because everything is so beautifully made (also applies to Holy Mountains). The game knows exactly when to slow you down or speed you up and there's nothing you can do about it no matter how uncomfortable you get. Smooth movement and very effective narration.I play a lot of horror and I must admit that a certain chapter of this game made me truly physically ill (in a good way!) and I will never look at sculptures the same way again :)Personally, Prelude is my favorite in the series (although... Holy Mountains is so beautifully done!).And please turn up your brightness before you complain."
,Not Recommended,248470,8142931,"Posted: 20 December, 2013",all,Osiris Saline,"Doorways introductory chapters held a lot of interesting ideas and promise for the by-now well trodden/beaten -pick and delete depending on your level of cynicism- atmospheric amnesia first person horror genre.I purchased the game for the atmosphere that was shown in the trailer and this is where the problems started to become apparent. After 5 minutes in game during the tutorial I noticed how the sound was looping, the ambient music, the effects, the wailing in the distance. Now, I am well aware that games like Penumbra & Amnesia which have clearly inspired Doorways commit the same looping but their loops tend to be a little longer than 20 seconds so I was let down in that regard, fair enough, I'm here for the gameplay. I played on.The level design itself is rather poor, from the very first moment you step out of the tutorial you realize that rather than expand upon the rather basic controls & level structure shown in the first few minutes, the game will simply apply the same rigid poorness to every area. Whether you are meant to be outside or inside it always feels like you're stuck in a rather poor Time Splitters 2-esque custom map from 2002. Add in the issues with the sound & atmosphere and you can already tell I was getting rather bored within 20 minutes.Outside of the structure of the levels the graphics themselves are middle of the road for an independent horror game without much financial support, so that is not a problem to me, however the issue with the graphics & levels is that when you step into a new area the screen goes black for a split second and loads things up. You want to see a ghost? You'll know when because the screen will blink. I have absolutely no idea of what goes into coding but this is not good enough, it's like refreshing a screamer website!Is Doorways as good as a screamer website though?No.The shocks did not make me jump or lose my footing, the atmosphere of the game left me with a rather sarcastic expression after every attempted tension building moment, and the ideas behind the killings & horror is so trope based I wanted to become a Yorkshireman and hang myself with t'rope I have handy in my DIY kit in order to stop the pain.Did I keep on playing? Yes, I didn't immediately turn the game off after tasting my salty disappointment because I did enjoy the implementation of basic floor tile/memory jumping within a castle. That may sound dull but within the confines of this game it was the peak of the experience for me. Still, after chapter 1, boredom once again crept in like a badly designed giant enemy in chapter 2.The one upside is my boredom didn't last very long!Not due to any particular excitment or interest from the game but because I completed both chapters within an hour and 35  minutes. 95 minutes for two chapters of a game that I paid full price for. These two chapters amount to 50% of Doorways chapters, as you will have already done the math that means two more chapters are incoming, but there is no way I would spend money on a sequel set to Chapters 1 &2. In fact I doubt I'd even play them unless they were a free expansion to make up for the first two chapters.Doorways is lacking in longevity, ingenuity, atmosphere, and scares. It's frightening only in the sheer disappointment it offers, comparable to a once hopeful post-degree move into an empty dreary admin assistant job market.Avoid, if you're looking for new atmospheric horror right now I'd suggest having a long break after you finish Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs."
76561198048974498,Recommended,248470,20483688,"Posted: 12 January, 2016",all,rjmacready,"I actually played most of this some years back - in fact, it was one of the very first games I ever played on Steam! - but alas, my laptop back then was a steaming great pile of doggy-doo, and the lag I experienced ultimately meant that I had to throw in the towel and wait for a better computer.  Well, I've now owned that better computer for well over a year, so I guess the time taken to get BACK to this game doesn't quite suggest that I found it all that ""compelling"" the first time around.Coming back to it though, I gotta say, it actually stacks up EXTREMELY well next to a lot of the cheap, ""indie"" horror games which have come out since.  It's maybe never quite ""inspired"", but Doorways: Prelude is consistently solid.  Very solid.  BRICK solid.  Almost the textbook definition of ""solid"".So what exactly does the gameplay comprise of, you ask?  Is it a traditional ""survival horror"", in the vein of the early Resident Evil and Silent Hill games?  No.  Definitely not.  Is it more like a post-Amnesia: The Dark Descent ""stealth horror"" game, a la Outlast and Alien: Isolation?  Again...no, not really, but definitely getting warmer.  Is it a...gulp...""walking simulator"", then?  Well...hmmm...again, no.  Not really.  But kinda.  But really kinda not, considering how many opportunities the game gives you to DIE.""SO WHAT THE HELL KINDA HORROR GAME IS IT, THEN?!"" I hear you scream, in mounting frustration.  Well, hmmm...lemme think a sec...I guess it's really a bunch of quite different and varied ""mini-games"", and therein lies the difficulty in trying to nail it all down.  This isn't a BAD thing, though, when the vast majority of said ""mini-games"" are actually rather GOOD ""mini-games"" - don't spend too long in the dark or die, find the correct path across the trap-laden floor, that kinda thing - and the overall game ultimately serves up oodles of what horror gamers generally seek the most:  Spooky and interesting locations, puzzles which are challenging but not TOO tricky, and spooky atmosphere and (fairly minor) scares aplenty.""BUT ARE THERE ENEMIES?"" I hear you ask next, still not quite convinced what it is that you'll be buying if you throw down your hard-earned dosh for this game.  Um...again, no easy, regular answer to this question, but my best attempt would be:  Yes.  Sometimes.  Sort of.  Though not generally in the ""traditional"" sense.  But as I mentioned above, there's no end of ways to meet your demise, so don't fret if you're a member of the ""not another ♥♥♥♥ing walking simulator"" crowd.  Rest assured, unless you're a much more competent gamer than myself - not hard, admittedly - you're not liable to complain that you didn't cark it enough times in the course of your play-through (which, for the record, is probably somewhere in the three to five hour range, making it kinda short but sufficiently sweet).  There's certainly a fair element of trial-and-error style gameplay, though it's certainly no Limbo in that regard, and the save/check-points are frequent enough to never render it TOO frustrating in that department.Sure, there's a few things wrong with it:  It's insanely dark (I mean visually, not just tonally!), but once you crank your brightness up a little it's fine (and don't feel guilty for doing so...I certainly didn't, 'cause it really is borderline unplayable in parts if you DON'T).  And sure, the whole ""here's a static, cut-screen image of a spooky little girl to signify your death"" thing is usually a sure-fire sign of cheap AND nasty, but somehow it seems justifiable enough in the way it's used in this game, and if you stick around long enough, you WILL encounter ""enemies"" which actually MOVE (but I won't spoil that for you).So what about the price?  Well, it's possibly a tad steep at ten bucks, so unless you're frankly unconcerned by such things, I'd probably wait for a sale.  In any case, I'm taking it as a good sign of what's to come in the two episodes released since, and if it's any kind of incentive, I just purchased said remaining episodes on the strength of re-playing this one (granted, in a sale)!  I can only assume that the games get BETTER as they progress, and if so, this is a pretty bloody good start.Verdict: 9/10."

The graphics are good, especially the lightning, which is beautiful.The puzzles are solvable and enjoyable and don't break the immersion with only the torture devices puzzle being an exception, but the other interesting puzzles easily make up for that. The game is quite easy overall and not too hard to beat, there are few situations in which anything but the puzzles can kill you, but these situations are very well made and tension-filled.The atmosphere in the first chapter is amazing, it's very dark and eerie and gives off a lost-tape vibe, the atmosphere in the second chapter is not nearly as well done as in the first chapter but still acceptable.The thing that I dislike most about the game itself is the story, I don't know what it is but it just doesn't make sense to me and it doesn't interest me enough to dig deeper, but the gameplay generally makes up for that.The only thing that should prevent you from buying Doorways: Prelude is the price of 9.99€ which is, in my opinion, too high for an average horror game with an average playtime of 2 hours.

There is some potential even if the first two chapters are not going to come across very strong. The first chapter isn't very good, relying on the fact that you can barely see in the dark for its 'challenge' factor, which is really more exasperating than anything, but it still didn't take long to get through.The second chapter is more of a traditional puzzle environment with some audio/visual creepiness to it, but is by no means very scary. I did want to play through these games to see where the Doorways series is going though, and overall, each one improves in art quality and game design.This specific purchase is Chapters 1 and 2, with 'Doorways Underworld' being Chapter 3. Having played through all 3, there isn't any real reason to play 1 and 2 in terms of narrative or world building that I could see and 3 is probably the most fleshed out in terms of having interesting mechanics, so it wouldn't be wrong to skip straight to it unless you just want to make sure to see all the series has to offer.Ultimately, you are going to be playing a low budget, small dev team game, so keep that in mind when you judge it if you decide to pick it up."

,Recommended,248470,19295713,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,Scrubsauce,"I was first turned on to Doorways over at Rock Paper Shotgun with the original Early Access trailer.  I'm really finicky about what Early Access stuff I do go in on and while the trailer with all of the static, agonized human statues piqued my interest, I opted to let the game sit on my wishlist until it was out of EA and on sale.  I finally got around to this bundle this past October, since like most Steam indies, it ended up in a never ending back log of shame and excitement (shamecitement?).The first chapter featured some basic puzzles and fleeting jump scares, though the style of the models bordered somewhere between an amateur aesthetic and illustrator intent aiming for a ""not quite real"" art style.  It wasn't distracting, though it did harken back to the late 90's/early 00's, and I'd be lieing if I didn't feel a little nostalgic going back to a world with that level of fidelity.The second chapter was a marked improvement, and I ended up appreciating its Amnesia-esque, crumbling castle setting much more.  I felt like I could feel the developers improving in their ability to build a functional, good looking product as I progressed through the plot.  The game never really felt horrifying, but there was something about the enemies in Chapter 2 that was really unsettling.  I'm not sure if it was uncanny valley rearing its not-quite-ugly-enough head, but it added the hint of creepiness the game needed to establish the atmosphere the developers seemed to be aiming for.  The puzzles were also a little more involved, reminding me of Penumbra and older point-and-click adventures from way back.  Though the game ended abruptly, I have Chapter 3 waiting in my backlog and as of this writing I hear Chapter 4 is in Early Access, so I'm curious to see where the series goes from here.Other stand out features from this game include the narrations provided by Amnesia alumni, Sam A. Mowry.  Before looking up the voice actor, I was convinced the voice was somehow modified or synthesized.  The delivery is ominous and is almost too powerful, making the main character feel like something more paranormal than a regular dude.  The plot was also a tad confusing, as the opening exposition makes it seem like you're some sort of detective, though as the story progresses it seems like something more is going on the player hasn't been made fully aware of.I wouldn't drop dough on this if you're expecting a solid horror game, but for the right price it's a nice novelty that excels at showing a development team grow and improve at their craft."

It has an excellent atmosphere, soundtrack, and the voice acting (for the most part) is well done and fits the mood of the game. The graphics themselves are not terrible, the textures leave something to be desired but it all goes into the atmosphere and really blends.The Bad - Firstly, this game is too dark; Its not uncommon to get turned around and completely lose sense of direction because you can't see further than 8ft in front of you. Secondly, the story (as such far) doesn't make a lick of sense. I won't into spoilers but, the first chapter ends abruptly with little to no closure and story continous onto the next psychopath. The narrative constantly flip-flops on whether or not these events are all psychological or physically present. Thridly, the puzzles in the game are far too easy, they can be compared with puzzles from the Uncharted series as they practically show you the solution, you just have to do it. And lastly, its too short; It only takes about an hour to go through the whole thing on a first playthrough, subsequent playthroughs are almost twice as fast.OVERALL - As of this moment, I do not recommend it. For the amount of time it takes to beat it, coupled with the ridiculously bad storytelling; Doorways is an extremely forgettable title.**This review is likely to change once the final two chapters are released. However, it's been nearly six months since Chapters 1 & 2 released, and Saibot Studios hasn't even hinted at giving a release date. Doorways looks to be dead in the water."

Darkness abounds but you're meant to find clues.

Unlike most episodic games, the ""chapters"" here are woven together without obvious narrative breaks and at this point it is just not clear what exactly you are supposed to achieve besides uncovering the truth about these murderers.The gameplay is simple, you move through dark forest and the dark castle corridors, avoiding a few traps and collecting various objects so that you might in turn pull levers and activate switches.This game is not scary at all. The puzzles are too easy and the story is not interesting.The graphics are not worth to mention.The voice acting and sound is good but not more.The game does not deserve the title ""Horror game"" it is boring and can not deliver a good horror atmosphere. It is more a jump & run in the dark.

This game may be good but designers like this lose sight of the gfact that to play a game we kinda need to see the game.  This game uses Oculus Rift, giving the whole game a fisheye look, I guess that is what Oculus people like to play games as a fish in the dark?Being innovative in design doesnt mean they should make games so dark their unplayable, maybe they made it so dark to hide how bad it is so people would just turn it off and uninstall it like I did.  For those who would like to see how NOT to make a game, be sure to play this game, also the controls using a controller make no sense really, they seem made up by a madman choosing random features to put on random buttons.  For some reason the bumpers move things back and forth like penumbra which is odd as if the character is so weak they cant lift anything, so like Penumbra you go around nudging everything, maybe the main character should be called the Nudger, a new type of super hero who goes around nudging things.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00"

It has good atmosphere and antagonists which will make you cower in fear and want to hide in a corner. The difficulty is not overwhelmingly ridiculous, while not being too easy. It will keep you on your toes and perhaps make you cry a bit.One of the things I really liked was the huge variety of gameplay environments. You go through dark forests, a castle, and more.Some other reviewers complained about it being too dark. I'm guessing most of them didn't go into the game's video settings, where the brightness can be turned up (it's set to minimum by default). I never had a problem with it being too dark.The only thing I did not like about this game was its inventory mechanics. At times, you need to hurry and grab something out of your inventory (and I mean, really quickly), but it takes a good few seconds to pull up the inventory and take something out. That's just enough time for one of the antagonists to murder you.Overall, though, I strongly recommend this game."

To be honest this game is less horror and more mystery/walking simulator/puzzle esc. There are no Monsters except for enviromental traps, although one type of monster(if you can call it that) did show up and it did manage to give me the chills.The Pros:- Writing: This game is very well written with the notes you find, along with the narration, which the voice actor does a damn good job.- Gameplay: The game plays fine, its not spectacular, but compared to most horror games I've played through steam, just to have a horror game that functions as intented is a plus.- Torture chamber devices, - some of the torture devices you encounter were pretty original which i found entertaining. +-The Cons:- Boring : This game is boring, there are no enemies, the ones you encounter are part of the enviroment, except for one, and that part only lasts 30 seconds.- The Lighting: This game is stupidly dark most of the time. I know dark enviroments are a plus, and in this game there are parts where you need to constantly light a torch to get through areas or you'll die. But some areas in general were just WAAAYYY to dark to even see what i was doing, which were during certain platform-esc sections , i basically had to have all ights off in the room and squinting at my TV just to see what the heck i was doing- Music: It seems to loop alot, gets kinda annoying and repetitive.Overall I found this game ok as a Horror experience, i see many people feel differently about the Horror aspect, and they are entitled to their opinions. I found the game creepy throughout and had a cupple scary parts, but dont espect quality like Outlast or Alien Isolation. I know this game is on sale now for a cupple bucks and if you were thinking of picking this up at any time now would be perfect."

I stopped early in chapter 1 and uninstalled.The first hour or two of the game consist of trudging through an unexplained strange terrain, with ""spooky"" music and sound effects, while occasionally picking up extremely vague and disjointed notes that appear to have no connection at all. Deadly ghosts may appear, apparently only to serve as a very startling ""try again"". The only ""challenges"" consisted of dragging something in order to jump from it, a ""move between checkpoints before your torch is extinguished"" puzzle (otherwise something goes ""boo"" and kills you), and very simple ""jumping over a chasm"" puzzles.There is no explanation of who you are, why you are there, why you are seeing ghosts and hearing spooky noises. Basically, the first hour is walking in a straight line while things go ""boo"" at you, which after the initial heart-pounding is just plain annoying. The only challenge is to endure this linearity while things try to startle you.Now, compare this to other games.In Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you don't know who you are or where you are *as part of the plot* and that is made *immediately* known to you. Which is an awesome hook. Also the puzzles are rather clever, progress is often not linear, and you actually have some action - albeit you can only run & hide rather than any fighting. But, hiding someplace dark with your head down while *something* seems to be shuffling its (feet? tentacles? body?) outside provides a true atmosphere of genuine horror. Being startled is a less-used aspect of the game, whereas finding tinder for your lamp so your character doesn't go insane from the horror of being in the dark too long is much more satisfying and works a whole lot better. If you want a real ""horror"" experience, that's the one for you.In Deadspace, they rely on startling you quite a bit, so if that's what you like, head on there. But, over there you know who you are and why you're there, and while some aspects of what occurred where you are remain unknown for a good while, hints are everywhere and it's very clear the place had a clear function that has turned into a horror scene. While the ultimate causes remain mysterious, the actual occurrences are not and are merely a sign of how screwed up an otherwise ordinary place has become. So again that works much better. Also, you get to actually fight whatever jumps at you rather than a bland ""try again"", and other action (e.g. zero gravity, zero pressure environments) is very fun and very satisfying.Now, you may think I just have a short attention span, and maybe I do and this game deserves a more thorough examination - but I don't think so. Both of the games I mentioned gave me much more entertainment in the first 5 minutes than this was able to deliver in an hour. There I cared about the characters, here I suddenly realized that I don't give a damn what happens to this nameless character with no motivation in a place we don't know how or why the character got to and no attempt is made to explore this or even acknowledge it.Bottom line: Not worth your time."

I mean, there were points where I carefully moved around after hearing something, but it was forgotten as soon as it looped twice.To continue, I feel that the torch doesn't burn long enough. How does a torch burn for aprox. 5 second, go out, and is then imediatly able to burn again? I also noticed at the begining of the game, that an object being pulled moves faster than the player themselves, allowing you to 'ride' the small rocks and even have them conitue to be 'pulled' when it finally clears you.Moving with other complaints, the game at sertain points, is too dark. While turning up the brightness does help some, there are sections of the game where it doesn't help. Early on in the game, it is clearly stated that you cannot be in the darkness too long or else you die. However, when you're inthe professor's torture chambers, this rule is sort of broken. When you complete the main room, it is just about pitch black and is possible to get lost for short periods of time.Speaking of threats [of enemies], there are very few. In chapter 1, just stay out of the pitch dark and don't touch the specters. In chapter 2, just watch out for the wrong statues. Durring my play through, I realised quickly that enemies were few and predictable. Having such large spaces of safety really turns the scare fact or down.Over all, the game wasn't scary, it was a little too dark, a tiny bit buggy, but an alright starter game for anyone easing themselves into horror games, as long as it isn't full price."

Otherwise, wait until it's finished to actually pick it up.The game itself was very easy for me to immerse myself in and I did have a couple scares.  Not too many enemies and the puzzles weren't too difficult either.  But I do enjoy the game due to the creepy factor in chapter two.  Definitely a game to play at night and something to play if you're a streamer/YouTuber and need a change of pace."

It's very much a search & find puzzle game with a dark atmosphere and interesting story. I can get behind it having the same actor as the guy from Amnesia. Nice touch. There are some ""monster"" mechanics in reference to the ghost & the statues but they're very limited and not much in the way of an actual threat. The puzzles are fairly simplistic and quick to get through with a bit of common sense ( & brightness ).Speaking of which, my only real complaint is that the game is too damn dark. I understand what it's going for. Dark, foreboding and spoopy, that's great. But a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to puzzles, especially the memory game during the castle run. I had to take several shots in the ""dark"" ( pun intended ) before actually reaching my goal.I'd honestly wait until these games are on sale in order to buy and play them just like I did around the Steam Christmas Sale. It's worth giving a try at the very least but not for 9.99 ( but that's just me being a cheapskate ) Might not be everyone's cup of tea but it kept me entertained enough to continue onto ""The Underworld""."

There's no collecting things to stay alive like in Amnesia. It's a creepy atmospheric game with some puzzles and enemy sequences.This game is the first two chapters in the Doorways series. Because of that, it's pretty short. I beat it in only a couple hours. The first chapter was ok, but the second chapter was very creepy.The platforming aspect isn't for everyone but it's not unfair as other reviews have said. There aren't any blind jumps in a pitch black evironment save for a moment after beating a boss near the end of chapter 2, but I didn't die from it at all. I could still tell where I needed to go and make the jump.It's no Amnesia, but I think it's a good effort for their first game and I'm looking forward to playing the rest of the series."

That is not to say it's necessarily a bad game the story was kind of interesting, but alas it's not enough to justify the price tag of $8.53.If this game is updated in the near future I'm willing to give it a second chance considering how difficult it is to make good survival horror games."

,Recommended,248470,34415671,Posted: 22 August,all,Pimpstyle9008,"Small short game (3 hours average game time) with a really amazing story line.  Not much of a horror game to me personally, but more of a psychological dark torture themed game with puzzles.  There are a few dangerous puzzles which can take more than one try to pass.  Study the game for it's details to reveal secrets!  Every location is there for a reason so explore to get 100% completion.  I really liked how the notes had narration along with emphasis on certain parts of the dialogue.  Not a hard game, but can require some critical thinking.  Do not get me wrong, if you are not a critic of games and enjoy them for their content, this game is perfect for those twisted individuals because after I beat the game in one sitting, I was craving more of the story.  The developers made the game with chapters so you have to buy the rest (separate games) to get the expansions.  I rate this game 6/10 because it is a bit high on the price (About $40 for the entire story, three games) for the amount of gameplay included and the story does not end when you finish the game, it continues on with Doorways: The Underworld and ending the story with Doorways: Holy Mountains of Flesh.  The Doorways series relies on art and detail to go with the story.  So this game can feel like a walking simulator from time to time because of the lack of immersion in certain sections, such as the beginning and tutorial.  Older people would like this game since it does not require much to run (dual core) and its only about 500 mb's of storage.  As for the younger generation, it can be boring because of the lack of jump scares."

But you get used to that and it adds to the gameplay. When you die, you don't have to replay a lot, so a misstep into the void is not really a problem. Looking forward to continue with chapter 3."
