It's not really that similar to anything else; the combat is all automatic, and your main job (as a god) is to manage your empire, build armies, build forts, research and cast spells, and plan out where your armies will go.The graphics are sufficient for the job they do, and there's a plethora of addtional mods and maps and what not available for it.All told, i quite recommend it to any fans of strategy who are looking for something a little different."
76561198007423887,Recommended,248510,8114651,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,Angelo Dante,"I highly recommend this game to any strategy enthusiasts or fans of mythology out there. I'll go ahead and get the (tiny) amount of bad out of the way - the game has an unusual user interface, and selection of units can be especially tedious sometimes. With that detail out of the way, I only have good to say about Dominions 3. The writing in the game is top-notch, and very detailed. You often have to play multiple races to get a fuller picture of the history, but it's rich and satisfying once you put it together. The Tuatha and the Fomorian Giants are a good example. The game plays in a standard fashion with territories and movement, much like other turn-based games. However, to locate the useful goodies in a territory, you'll have to cultivate a few powerful mages, to find hidden sites that can provide mana gems, unique units for recruitment, or unique effects once unearthed. You'll need them (and magi once again) for the forging of magical items to equip your agents, priests, mages, generals, and your Pretender God. But the true meat of the game is in spreading your dominion (aka faith) across the map. It is the source of your power, and since it can flow into enemy territoy, it can also hamper their efforts to withstand your (inevitable) attack. Be sure to build lots of temples in your own honor! Put those puny mortal mages to work researching powerful magic that can affect the whole world. Turn day to perpetual night, bring on and endless winter, kill someone anywhere in the world, dispach the flying monkeys! Last Pretender God standing wins the prize - true Godhood. Sounds simple, right? Think again. It's a deep and complex game, and can be quite the challenge at times. So join in the fun, weave your own epic tale! Smash vampires with giants, ♥♥♥♥♥ queens (yes, its a real pretender) with a midget masher, run from Cthulu! It's all in there, and waiting for you!"

Some of the concerns should be equally valid in multiplayer tho.Pro:- lots of nations and spells to play withContra:- no upgrade path except for magic, you start and end the game with the exact same troops- larger empires are micromanagement nightmares (commander limits, picking up scattered units, managing troop supplies for fronline armies etc on a 45 province map is already horrible)- tedious mopping up of beaten opponents (hopefully you didnt pick low dominion while trying to assault a water fortress with Shamblers ...)- hands off battles- almost non existent province developmentAnd just as a side note there isnt really a steep learning curve, its just that you have to memorize spells and units or you will be looking up those all the time. Games like Chess and Go can offer a deep strategic experience without overboarding rule complexity. Dominions while initially fun becomes tedious and boring very quickly."
,Recommended,248510,28388614,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,Gespenst Gaming,"This is a very enjoyable fantasy strategy-sim. It's plays very similar to a Total War series game, but with a more hands off approach to the battles (you don't directly control units, but you can give them pre battle formations and priorities, like telling your cavalry to wait a turn before going to attack the enemies archer units).There is kind of a big lack of explaination for a lot of things in the game itself, so you'll have to refer to the manual or the wiki, but I figured out 95% of it on my own. One example is the game lets you give magic gems (that are a resource for casting global spells and making magic items) to your commanders, but it doesn't explain anywhere ingame the benefits of doing that. Turns out it improves their magic casting abilities of the associated gem/magic type by 1 level for having the gem equiped. But some characters also generate magic gems for you and they get put in their inventory until you retrieve them.It took me about 4-5 games to explore how the various mechanics work, like how faith spreads, how you research magic, how building good armies and giving them the right orders to increase their effectivness. Experiment and read the ingame hints about the things that are described and it's easy enough to catch on."

This game has a very long (but not too steep) learning curve.  I'm just now beginning to read the manual that goes along with it.So what do you want from a game?If you want a way to spend your time which is compelling: maybe sitting in front of the computer looking at the game itself and going through some grand strategy plan, or it might be reading the book that will gently unfold ""every byte in the game"" for you.  If this sounds like fun (and it is!) then trust me, you won't regret buying this game.Every ""square"" on the board begins at the start of the game as neutral (except for starting cities).  As armies conquer squares, they contribute to your economy, but they are also then easily conquered unless you station vast defending armies (which you're rather use for conquering new squares).  So it eventually becomes a land-grab game that I still haven't quite gotten my head around.  It's quite difficult.The depth in the game is an insane amount of content.  Every time I play I'll discover some new item I didn't know could be forged.  I'm sure there are people who know all this stuff, but it's quite something discovering new items or spells and the possibility of new strategies as a result.There are also placement and timing strategies to look at.And afflictions.  I LOVE that heroes in the game can have afflictions!Religion plays a big role adding flavor to the game and I still haven't quite grasped the historical references other than resemblences to myth.  It's almost alien almost familiar - I like how they did it.Dominions 3 also seems to be designed to play multiplayer by e-mail, so all moves by all players are concurrent (rather than taking turns) - this is one of the few turn-based games I'm aware of which uses concurrent moves - which is why battles are auto-resolved (they have to be).  Even though battles are auto-resolved, as already mentioned, there are troop placement and timing strategies which will make a huge difference in battle outcomes (guaranteeing that troops arive at the front line all at the same time becomes a consideration).[EDIT]Cons:The game does have a downside, which is the lack of automating some very repetitive tasks, such as what actions you always want a specific unit to use.  My impression is that the game designers are really good at designing gameplay and background, but horrible at designing ""workflow"", which are repetitive tasks that eventually wear down the player.  In it's defense, the game seems to be designed for multiplayer via e-mail - where you might make a few moves a day and games could go on for a very long time - rather than single player versus AI where you're making several moves every few minutes."

For example, while researching the ""construction"" school of magic, you are given no clue on what you can craft from it. Even after researching the spell, you have no idea what you can craft because many of the craftable items are not visible because the mage you select do not have the required paths in magic.When summoning a monster, you have no idea what stat and abilities that monster will have and will need to trial and error to find out. To make an informed decision in a strategy game like this you really need detail info that the game does not provide. Is a summoning a giant turtle better or a sea serpent? Who knows? Just toss a coin to decide!- Really dated graphics- No control over the actual battle itself. You really need good understanding of the games' mechanics (which are cryptic and inaccessible) to script your troops to do combos and perform desirably.Pros- Huge variety of customizations.You can design your avatar, a pretender god in multiple ways that will drastically affect your game. Your god might be good at combat, single handedly defeating whole armies, support your faction by providing various faction wide bonus or give your troops powerful buffs in battle. The possibilities are endless.Not only can you customize your avatar, you can customize your heroes by giving them various crafted artifacts while a variety of effects. The kind of artifacts that you can create are limited by your god's and your mages' power in the different schools of magic, so careful planning is needed.- The game mechanics is excellent once you grasps the basics. The the variety of tactics and combos that can be pulled off are almost limitless.- Many factions to choose from that play very differently from one another. The lore of the game is refreshingly different from standard fantasies."

Started playing Dominions 3, few monts later Dom 4 came out - moved to it.Now I'm playing Dominions 3 and enormousely enjoying it. Less spells, less magical items than in Dom 4 - somehow even more fun.Why I like Dominions:1. Very interesting fantasy setting (not just elfes and other copies of Tolkien imagination) with Valkiries, armoured gorillas, ghouls, giants, chariots, eagle-men, bat-men, spider riders, raptor riders, fiery salamanders, armoured or undead elephants, giant ants, tiny dragonflies, barechested warriors, tritons with amber armour, hydras, halfblind cyclopes, nagas, twoheaded giants, liches, krakens, dragons, mechanical dragons, trolls, tengu, ghosts, lamias, jaguars, werejaguars, powerfull but insane gods, mages of various kinds,assasins, shark knights, Vikings with glamour, Aztects with flying ability and many, many more...2. Ingenious balancing of nations. Other games do balancing + variety this way: one side gets a sword and shield the other axe and a shield. Dominions does it like this: one side gets a sword and a shield the other gets a catapult and a sharpened stick :-)    and it works!3. No researching of buildings, basically there are only 3 buildings you can build in a province: castle, magical reaserch lab  and a temple. Less hasle with buildings and a refreshing change from the industry standard.4. Spells, spells, spells :-) starting from minor ones like fire flies (weak and available with no reaserch) to fire storm (burns everything on the battlefield that does not have full fire protection, requires a lot of reaserch and a powerfull fire mage).5. IT'S DIFFRENT.6. Challenging single player even after hundreds of hours of play.7. Great and athmosferic music.8. The battle set up: give orders to commanders, mages and units before battle; later during the battle you just watch how your orders interplay with orders given by your oponent: surprises guaranteed, especially in multiplayer battles. Many a time I was watching biting the nails, seeing how my main force was pummeling the enemy but my oponents flanking party was going for my commander - battle of Gaugamela all over again.9. Great community - higher IQ average than the many other games out there :-)10. Small developer firm with dedicated staff. Basically like Creative Assembly before they were bought with Total War series by Sega. Upgrades are free and regular, game works like a clock on day one, patches fix some mechanics you never even new existed, developers behave on forums like your friends: nice, profesional, informative and surprisingly patient towards the odd troll or idiot :-)11. Depth. 3 eras with circa 20 nations in each one, every nation has different soldiers (is hydra a soldier?) and commanders, some very usfull, some meh and some ridiculosly usless until that day when you find a use for them :-)    Hundreds of spells that can be divided in 3 categories: battlefield spells that have effect on a particular battle (relevant mage has to be present), rituals used on strategical map (for example ritual that summons wywern or mechanical men that you can use in later battles) and global rituals that have a major effect on the strategical map and the battles (for example global ritual that calls darkness and gives penalty to all units in battle that don't have the special ability darkvision). Hundreds of magical items (dwarven hammer is so  much better in Dom 3 than in Dom 4).12. The distinction between strategical map and tactical map and how both are working.13. The ideas inherent to the game and seen nowhere else e.g.:A. units get tired on battlefield and that makes possible for an army of pitchfork fielding peasants to overwhelm a small group of knights (even though initially the knights cut them in heaps) IF (very big if) there is enough of the peasants.B. bless effect that changes sacred units into even stronger ones and you can choose the bless effect at the start of the game.C. Dominion which is like the population strenght of faith in you, the Pretender God. Has effect on how many sacred units you can buy, how strong some global rituals are and on morale of your troops. Also as you are pretending to be a God (one of many) in the game, the added benefit is that no fundamentalist muslim can play the game :-)D. the way afflictions affect the units - especially extremal cases when you see a unit that is blind, cripled, weakened, with a chest wound and battle fright but still on the battle rooster.Could go on and on but 13 is my lucky number so...Herehttp://www.illwinter.com/dom3/you can find link to a manual - try to read a few pages at least.Herehttp://www.moddb.com/games/dominions-3-the-awakening/forum/thread/dominions-3-demo1you can find link to OLD DEMO OF DOMINIONS 3 - not sure if still works but it was great back in the days to get a taste of the game.

I love how you are slowly introduced to the lore; it never feels like a chore to read it to get into the game, you just pick up some of it as your priests randomly summon some ultra-powerful seraphim that then randomly gets itself killed by wandering around the map.Sure, there's certain techniques that are pretty powerful, and certain races in certain ages are far stronger than others, but it's a game you can learn, and like life not everything has to be balanced.  It's fun to learn, fun to play, and fun to experiment with.  Enjoy, especially if it's on sale (though I get all my games on sale :)).  Also, check out Conquest of Elysium.  Same developers, also very interesting game, and generally much cheaper."

It's fun if you're into details like I am but the ingame version of my God wasn't nearly as exciting.You start from the rather ugly map that consists most of the gameplay. There's your starting grid where you click recruit troops to... recruit troops. Then you assign these said troops under commanders which are like better troops than 'just troops'. You can choose the actions they take in battle... wait, oh, that's it! The problem is that you don't play any part in the combat itself. You move to a grid containing enemies and the combat auto-resolves to show you the outcome as a text-file or you can choose to watch the sprites go at it. It's fun for a couple times but you just start to slowly wish you could do more. But no, that's it.Next turn begins and you recruit more troops and set the ones you recruited last turn to move and capture more grids until you find your opponents. There's endless amounts of content here if you enjoy reading a novel of statistics but besides that there's no much to do. You might argue that there's a deeper level to the games strategy and there might be, I would've died to boredom if I tried to find out.I'm deeply dissapointed that there's also a fourth instalment of the series and by the looks of it's store page nothing has changed. It's just an add-on for Dominions 3 with now even more statistics to play around! Yay."

I played offline so that's why I don't have much playtime. Civilization is much better if you want an in depth strategy game with a much nicer learning curve, and there are free strategy games that are better than this."

There's quite a learning curve..I still don't really know what I'm doing. Virtually no tutorial, and a 150+ page instruction book. Having said that, this game is very fun once you get a modest understanding of it. Definitely not a game for everyone, but if you're into hardcore tabletop strategy, this game is for you."

If so, Dominions is probablyNOTfor you.  The graphics in the Dominions series are adequate to convey necessary information to the player.  I find they have a certain charm, but many disagree.Do you enjoy reading hundreds of pages of manual and forum discussions, and spending dozens of hours experimenting, to try to understand deeply complex systems?  If so, you might enjoy the Dominions series.  The basics (building units, moving them around the world, setting up formations, giving initial battle orders, casting a few spells, crafting enchanted equipment) aren't too hard to learn, though you will need to read the manual.  Designing thugs and super-combatants (units specially outfitted and/or buffed to be able to single-handedly wipe out armies and kill gods) takes a bit longer.  After a hundred hours, I'm barely sarting to get a handle on how to really use magic effectively.If you like your strategy games deep and complicated, and you've got some spare time, try the Dominions series."
