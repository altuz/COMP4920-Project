,Not Recommended,248530,11808769,"Posted: 21 August, 2014",all,Kenuty,"After reading what this game is about, I was disappointed in what I've played and not because the game is bad in any way or form. It was just plain boring in terms of gameplay mechanic, and the simulation aspect of it all. Yes I actually just beaten this game and I banged my head against my bathtub wishing this was a more complex simulator but instead is an arcadey, tedious, and casual game that needs way more work If you're wondering why I am not playing anymore of this game, This is how long it takes to beat the entire campaign. I think this game can be better than what it is and heres why.The game starts off with you looking at the map and seeing that there are 3 Large areas you can explore in the game, You'll start in Thailand then go to South Africa reefs, the last and final reef is the Bahamas all of which is decently sized and looks great.The gameplay is about spearfishing, Aim your speargun at a fish, shoot, and watch it automatically get reeled in with camera gameplay and treasure hunting thrown in.The missions consist of the player searching for treasures around the area, look around and shoot fish or find treasures for 5-10 mins, find specific fish, or take pictures of fish. These missions will repeat most of the time. You can kill so many fish but when it comes to sharks, turtles, jellyfish, morays, stingrays and so on the game will have a don't shoot box over them. When you do try to shoot them you'll shoot AIR. EMPTY AIR, even if the game says don't shoot I SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SPEAR THEM FOR THE HELL OF IT. If I do so I should also be punished for it instead such as being fined, or sharks coming back to bite me off. Something instead of empty air.The graphics to this game is quite nice and there is a good amount of fish to see and capture, the open area in the water and the underwatercave are pretty nicely done also and each of the maps are a decent size. The sound and music to this game is also nicely done HOWEVERThe mechanic and gameplay to this game is absolutely boring and unimmersive and also very arcadelike. It is very fun during the beginning of the game for about 30 mins then it just became repetitive and boring. Whenever you shoot a fish you'll acquire xp and gold which makes this annoying coin sound as if you're playing a slot game ruining the immersion of the game completely. After earning enough gold which takes about 5 mins or less of you swimming around shooting every fish you see in sight, you can then spend to upgrade 4 different things, your camera, more usb slots to take picture of fish, speargun accuracy and length, and your swim fins, once you fully upgrade all this. You'll swim at a really fast speed and any fishy you see  can easily be minced meat  basically because you'll become the son of poseidon himself. You're basically done and gold will completely become  useless except for spending on more usb slots to take pictures of fish. Hell even the picture taking mechanic is  pretty drysince all you need to do is point it as close to the fish as possible to take a picture as long as they are in the frame, the numbers also have to be 100% or you cant get points for taking thier pictures. Theres nothing in this game that can kill you except make you lose oxygen and there is nothing challenging about the breathing in this game at all, just swim to top and your oxygen can be filled fully without a single struggle, the only way you lose is when you forget that you're not diving but snorkeling.I think the game could do much better than this in future sequel. I want to be able to control the pulling of the fish in, Taking the spear out the fish or cutting the lines once I hunt them, drag them back to the boat feeling the weight of hunting. Instead of just picking up treasures from the ground with one button players should be forced to brush off the sand and figure out how to extact the treasure out carefully. Also the fact that I should be able to shoot any animal I want and in doing so will have a consequence on my gold or what not instead.If you're going to give players levels and XP in a game it should have a reason except that it was completely pointless. Right now this game has an awsome concept, but it needs to build on that concept and make itself AMAZING. I am not easily impressed because it was downright too simple, super casual.If you think I am lieing Go download the game and play it, Congratulations you've basically played 80% of the game for free.I also want to warn you guys of the dev pulling a fast one on bundle buyers which someone has come to my attention about.http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDealsMeta/comments/2e9yqd/depth_hunter_2_has_been_greenlit_get_your_steam/http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=saxg1h&s=8Long story short? Dev promised to try to get keys for people on desura etc, then turned around and rebundled game into a different name and in turn changed thier tune after getting greenlight. He didn't make a different game but took the same game and change its name so he doesn't have to give them keys. I would look up more about this company before you make your purchase in the future. This is something I do not condone from developers of breaking promises. Will not be buying anymore products in the future hell don't even send it to me for free.+Great Graphics+Good sized open area+Shooting fish is satisfying+Great amount of fish to shoot at+Sport is Extreme- Gameplay mechanic too simple, gets SUPER tedious- Can't shoot jellyfish, turtles, sharks, morays, dolphins, crabs, urchins, reefs, sponges and the list goes on- No multiplayer of any kind or score comparisons- Missions are downright tedious and boring, Find treasure, shoot a certain fish, or search out a fish with waypoints showing you directly where the fish is. Sometimes the treasure quest tells you to search in a 40km area then becomes boring as sin searching 30 mins on the ground clicking.My advice is to shelf out 10 more dollars, head to early access and get world of diving."
,Recommended,248530,12843438,"Posted: 8 November, 2014",all,HK,"Great game if you want to just kill some time and relax. Music is soothing, game play is simple. If you want to take pictures, hunt for treasure and just enjoy swimming around with the creatures of the sea then, this is a good game. However, maps are small and more maps are in the version of DLCs. You have limited underwater wildlife you can hunt for and sharks don't attack. In game upgrades are all purchased with the gold you find and the credits you earn while playing the game by hunting the fish and the like.I really can't give this a rating because, this is the first underwater game I've played of this type that I can remember. I'd have to play more of them before doing so. All-in-all, I'd say it's worth the time and money if you like these type of games.It does have a few missions in the game for you to accomplish so, it's not all just swimming around in the beginning. The missions don't seem to be mandatory but, completing them allows you to unlock more upgrades.Edit:As for more maps, I have 3 maps plus 2 after buying one DLC. Not sure how many maps there are in all though? 5 maps are a lot of exploring.  So, from what I can tell so far is, 3 of the maps are mission maps, the first three. The DLC maps are for exploration.2 more maps come with this DLC:http://store.steampowered.com/dlc/248530/I would also like to add that, all the pictures you take in game with the camera, it has a feature in your menu to view them and/or, make the as desktop wallpaper. That's cool. :)"

Don't upgrade your radar, so that the locations of treasure items don't get spoiled. Prolongs gameplay.Tricky end-game+ is finding all the coins which don't show on the radar.In the end it's like watching fish in an aquarium (in a positve calming way).Has nice underwater locations to discover/explore (coral reefs, caves, wrecks, ruins etc.)All in all nice little game. Perfect for 15min zen meditation chill out before going to bed.Buy when on sale. Only two DLCs give you additional 3d locations."
76561197991097142,Recommended,248530,29084492,Posted: 7 January,all,jHn,"This game is nice, when you're aware of what the features are.Maybe I should start with describing what this game is NOT:- It is NOT a realistic diving simulator.- It is NOT story-rich.- It is NOT challenging.So, what is Depth Hunter 2 then? It is perfect to relax. You start your tour on your boat, you get a short mission briefing and then you start to dive. You take a harpoon, a radar and a camera with you. To be successful, you have to catch some special types of fishes, find loot on the ground of the sea or take high-quality photos of reefs or animals. That's all. When you have finished all missions in one location, you unlock the next. There are 5 locations in general which vary slightly one from another. The surroundings are nice to watch, but could have been detailed more. The underwater world looks vivid, though.As I mentioned before, the game isn't challenging - you should not expect too much; The price of 15 bucks is way too high, wait until it is on sale and you can grab the complete bundle including all DLCs for around 5 €/$.As a result I can say, this game is perfect to relax and to bowl down some simple quests while you're enjoying some nice underwater-surroundings."
,Recommended,248530,11800867,"Posted: 20 August, 2014",all,shoggofu,"I've played for two hours straight. It was overall pretty fun, but I felt that there were a few things that were a bit tedious or would be better if they were different.- The game is more arcade like than a simulation, you can continuously spear fish rapidly without running out of spears or space to keep fish- At one stage I spent 20-30 minutes unable to find required objects which was tedious, but otherwise I didn't really have a negative experience.http://youtu.be/ZLDTmXVwAcUhttp://youtu.be/CYTOmTVfuEcSo you start in the first of free diving regions, Thailand. Each region is an large open underwater area. Within each region you will be given one specific objective after another as you complete them e.g. spear specified fish, photograph seabed, find treasure and so on. You are free to undertake these activities even if the aren't specified in your current objectives e.g. you can take photos and find treasure freely even if your supposed to be hunting.-----You have limited oxygen, running out will cause you to fail your current objective and have to restart it. That can be annoying if it was a long task, oxygen levels are easily resupplied by returning to the surface briefly. While no creatures will hunt you down and attack you, having contact with certain creatures will reduce your supply of oxygen e.g. spiky sea urchins, crabs and jellyfish. You can stay down for quite a long time i.e. 8 minutes underwater without breathing so it feel's more like you have a small oxygen tank that you can magically refill in a matter of seconds at the surface. I'm not sure that real divers would stay down for more than a few seconds or minutes especially if they are making such frequent dives. There really wasn't any challenge to managing your air supply.-----I found that I didn't really have to carefully stalk and take aim at fish while hunting. So this activity wasn't really satisfying in this way. You can pretty much spear the next fish the moment after you hit the last one and you have unlimited spears. Speared fish will be pulled towards you by the line of your speargun or vice versa depending and how big they and they will disappear when you have contact with them. There is also no limit to the amount of fish you can take and you don't need to return to your boat or anything to offload your catch. Their are certain creatures which you are unable to spear such as manta rays, sharks and those little Nemo clowns. But I basically swam around and slaughtered hundreds of fishes. Which was fun but didn't really offer any challenge.-----When I found my first gold coin I was very excited. I couldn't find anymore than that for while. So at first I thought it would have been challenging to find gold coins. However I soon found that there a actually many areas which have a fairly lot of gold coins scattered on the seabed. So I think it was actually too easy to find them and it was no longer satisfying. Also there aren't piles of coins. You have pick up each one individually and they didn't reward me with much cash or experience. Spearing fish provide with dramatically more experience and cash and it was very easy. So there wasn't actually a lot of point in finding the coins other than the possibility of completing an achievement.-----Aside from coins there are also artifacts and other valuables to find. I think the first thing I found was the 'Goblet of Doom'. I thought the idea of finding uniquely named objects was kind of cool. Unfortunately most most of the objects I came across afterwards only had generic titles. At one stage I had an objective to find 10 items of treasure around a certain location. The last items took me a long time to find and I was swimming around the same spots again and again. This became tedious, I think that task needed a time limit as some of the other missions do.-----You switch between your spear-gun and the camera using the mouse scroll wheel. I had to work this out myself. I don't remember an receiving an instruction from the game. A successful photograph requires 100% quality, which is achieved by swimming close to sea creatures at the right angle.-----Spearing, finding treasure and photographing rewards experience points and cash. Reaching higher experience levels rewards coins and at higher experience levels you seem to be rewarded increasingly more cash and experience for spearing or photographing fish and finding treasure. If you return to your boat you can purchase upgrades for your flippers/movement speed, spear gun, camera and oxygen supply. There isn't a huge selection and I basically acquired the best gear after playing for around an hour and a half.-----In main menu you can access a page that details all the fish that you have speared with kill count. Average weight and length of each fish is also listed even though they all look the same.Overall the graphics look good. I think effects used to make it feel undersea were adequate. There was a reasonable variety of sea creatures. The seascape look's nice and there you will occasionally come across sunken ship wrecks, planes etc. These don't really tend to have a lot detail when it comes to interiors. I was hoping that there would be an underwater cavern system and towards the end of my two hours game-play I found one. It appeared to be fairly extensive and maze-like which was cool.So a lot of the activities would probably be more satisfying if they were more challenging or just a bit more interesting. It's too easy to kill fish, resupply your oxygen and find coins. The greatest danger in this game for me so far was getting distracted and forgetting to take ten seconds to go up for air. If you didn't have an excessive oxygen supply every task in the game could be much more challenging. Simply giving all artifacts you find unique names and maybe some as well as making gold coins less common and more valuable would be an improvement. Overall this game was reasonable but I think it could be changed to be better.Clickherefor my YouTube gaming channel"

That's less than I'd pay to watch a movie or go to the pub for 3 hours so I'm not complaining.After 3 hours I'd got full upgrades (in fact I got most of them after the first mission after spending time collecting coins) and had played all the modes the game had - fishing, treasure hunting, taking photo's.Past that, other than more of the same on different maps the game was done for me. I guess it's possible there was a whole different game waiting to be unlocked after another hours worth of play but I doubt it.I think the main draw with this is the novelty of playing underwater (seems to be one of the next big things from what I can see). If that's what interests you then I'd try Subnautica instead. Otherwise, at sale prices this relieves a boring weekend afternoon - If I'd paid full price this would have been a negative review."

While subnautica has a heavy engine, really difficult to have smooth graphics, the engine of Depth Hunter 2 is way more optimized and, the diving experience is smoother.In the same way, subnautica's missions are boring as hell and, scenarios lack life and interest.Maps in Depth Hunter 2 are closer to the real thing, as well as fishes.But to be honest, this game has very little comparison to the real thing.Behavior of fishes is very dummy. Real spearfishing is way difficulter. Here you have very little chances to miss a shot.Air is other thing that's weird. Advanced spearfishmen go around 2 minutes 30 seconds, here you have time to build a house.It lacks some other things: stealth, camuflage, fish in holes, etc. and the proper reactions of the fishes to your own movements but, ok, this is a game and, no fishment, no joy.Overall, an interesting game if you love underwater."

It says ""Make a _____"" on just about every quest.-Small mapsLike it says, the maps are not really that big, they are certainly good looking and a bit interesting to explore, but there isn't much map to it. The standard game comes with 3 maps which can easily be fully explored in a matter of hours.-Uninteresting treasuresOne of the things you can do in this game is collect treasure on the sea bottom, things like ancient swords, shields helmets and stuff like that. But it's really just the same stuff scattered around randomly and with no history or story about them, i would have appreciated if the loot was unique for the map you were on and if they were real salvaged artifacts that had been re-created in the game and with a bit of history to read about them. But it's not like that, they also got silly names like ""Sword of justice"" like it's some sort of enchanted thing from a fantasy RPG.Overall it's a decent game to get on a sale if you enjoy underwater exploration games, but don't expect to get a whole lot of hours on it, because it's quite easily completed."

Please patch this Biart!  Otherwise, great game and a job well done!  :)"

If you're looking for a lot of variety here, this is not for you.  You swim around, catch fish, photograph some stuff, search for sunken treasure... all of which gets you some money so you can swim faster, stay underwater longer, hit fish with your spear easier and get a better camera.However, if you need to de-stress, or want something your young daughter (or son) can sit on your lap and participate in that isn't uber-violent, this is great.  My daughter gets a kick out of searching out the fish and seeing the turtle and the sharks.  It is a great way to let her experience one of my hobbies without her feeling excluded.I wish there was slightly more to do and that there was a reason to search out all the coins and treasures but am still giving it a thumbs up because it was and is a positive experience for me."

I wish the mechanics of the speargun were a little more realistic (no crosshair, slower reload) and if the fish got spooked and swam away if you got too close. A little slow, not a ton of action, but it's cool because it's really mellow. 8/10"
,Recommended,248530,20168742,"Posted: 31 December, 2015",all,MarioDragon,"I've been wondering for a while if there was a game that could replace my love for Endless Ocean, and Endless Ocean 2 failed miserably so I was a little surprised to come across Depth Hunter 2. This game is pretty basic; the manus are primitive and don't highlight when you hover them with your mouse, the tutorials and missions come on too fast and are extremely repetitive, and there's not a lot to catch once you've seen the 10 or so fish in each area relatively small area. Still, the oceans look great and there is definitely an exploration feel to this, although once you upgrade your speed to max the world feels extremely small.I wouldn't have minded some sort of a story, however basic, but this was a fun run through anyway. I have a feeling this might be a fun experiement with VR coming out shortly and think for the right price (on sale) Depth Hunter is a great casual game for those nights when you're bored with nothing else to do."

,Recommended,248530,21112768,"Posted: 10 February, 2016",all,Stormy,"It's a good game for three bucks.   Very relaxing.  Basically you swim around and either A) go harpoon fishing, where you single-handedly reduce the Pacific ocean's fish stocks by 50% with a speargun, B) Look for treasure, which is floating around the reef floor and pick up ancient plates and statues and such, or C) take photographs of various underwater attractions, like sunken planes and ships, coral reefs and other fauna, and underwater ruins.All three are fairly relaxing, though fishing becomes tedious quickly because of the relatively small number of fish you're allowed to spear (no dolphins or sharks or sea turtles, I'm afraid).   Trying to find every piece of treasure in a given area can get a bit tedious as well, so I would say photography mode is my favorite.  Exploring the wrecks is especially interesting.  I wish it were possible to turn off the navigation points within them though (maybe it is but I didn't see the option).Along the way you'll gain experience and money that can be used to unlock levels and purchase new gear, like flippers that let you swim faster and a camera with better zoom or more storage, or let you go longer between surfacing for air (because apparently you aren't SCUBA diving, but are in fact a snorkler with the world's greatest lung capacity).  It's all pretty easy to do and there isn't much in the way of grinding involved.So, yeah for three bucks it's a fun little diving game.  It's a genre that's been underserved for a long time but now there are a few games for it, the other main one being Subnautica.  That's much more of a tense survival game, but there's much more to it than Deep Hunter 2.  Then again, that one takes place on a fictional planet so you won't see real-world animals in it, and it isn't three dollars either."

Eventually, playing with keyboard and mouse is easier, espacially for hunting fish.Getting the game + DLCs during a sale is a good deal, for a few euros, the game is worth it.Underwater graphics are stunning, and fish are nice are pretty realistic, although the game itself is not a real diving simulator.Good overall immersion, positive feedback."
