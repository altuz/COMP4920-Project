So it's kind of trading a bit of SSB's gameplay for the whole customization arc, which is pretty fun. The same move can generally be found on a few different parts in different styles and/or equippable to different body zones, which is nice if you want to put together a slightly different skill set or just keep your favorite move without looking like an idiot, which is thoughtful. Gameplay can occasionally be frustrating in much the same way singleplayer SSB can, but the AI isn't usually as insufferable. The colorful lowpoly graphics are fun. The music is pretty decent except that most of the tracks have long, long periods of ambient quietness for some reason. Overall, not at all bad. Could it have been better? Certainly. Is it good? Definitely."

,Recommended,248550,11203723,"Posted: 12 July, 2014",all,Sinishred,"Megabyte Punch comes within inches of being a truly great game. It takes a working formula and overhauls it with loads of customization, while cutting out unneeded mechanics. This creates a fast-paced fighting game with a fun adventure game stacked on top. Unfortunately, the lack of ability to create your own custom matchups as well as the lack of online multiplayer drags the game down to being merely ""really good"".The meat of the game revolves around exploring levels, destroying enemies, and taking their broken parts as your own. The game uses a Super Smash Bros. style damage system, where the more damage a character has, the further an attack will send them flying. Non-boss adversaries can be destroyed by bashing them against a wall at high enough velocities, while bosses are fought in a classic Sumo-wrestling slugfest.The game is much more fast-paced than Super Smash Bros. and actively encourages building combos; A skill you'll need to master if you want to defeat bosses or win the tournament. As an aside, smacking an enemy hard enough to send them destructively cratering through the terrain isextremelysatisfying.Fallen enemies will drop either currency or one of their body parts, which you can install on your own character. Each part has a different ability attatched to it, ranging from increasing the number of double jumps you have to giving you a chaingun for an arm. You can have drills attatched to all of your limbs, allowing you to tear through destructable blocks with ease... or you can equip a bunch of parts that increase your damage output, turning you into a close-range terror. It's even possible to build a perfect replica of every humanoid character in the game - even the shopkeeper and the final boss!The presentation uses chunky 3D models and colorful if not cliche environments - the overrall presentation manages to evoke some level of nostalgia without looking like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ NES game. More people need to figure out that this is possible.The soundtrack is similarilly modern-nostalgic, combining the composition of chiptune music with modern synthesizers and drumkits. While I do feel that some of the level themes are a bit too cliche for their own good (looking at you, Ancient Tech Ruins) the overall soundtrack is pretty catchy, and in some cases, pretty hype too.Now, as with any good game, Megabyte Punch has some serious flaws. Firstly, finding some rare parts doesn't involve ""finding"" them so much as going through the same level over and over again until you randomly encounter a version of the enemy carrying that part. I must have played through Frostbyte Deep five times before one of the enemies decided to spawn with the Frostbyte Leg part. Additionally, while the game does tell you that certain rare parts can only be won in the tournament, it does not tell you that certain postgame parts can only be found in the shop... the shop which only carries duplicates of parts you already have 99% of the time.Another flaw with the game is the predictability of the AI. It's unfair to expect AAA-level brilliance from a game made by two guys, but the fact that I canrepeatedlyspam the Submachine Gun until the enemy shields, break said shield, and then KO them with a tornado kick without fail is a bit... disappointing. Additionally, the boss opponents become easilly confused when faced with more than one player character, rendering them unable to decide who to attack. And any enemy with a plasma cannon will annoyingly spam projectiles.All of these flaws are forgiveable. The game was made by two programmers and one composer, give them a break. However, there is ONE flaw with this game that I absolutely do not understand:there is no online multiplayer in Megabyte Punch.The official reason for this is that neither of the programmers had any prior knowledge of netcode and they didn't want to incorporate a flawed feature, so they left it out entirely instead. As far as co-op adventure mode or random matchmaking goes, this seems like a rational desicion. But can't I at least play peer-to-peer versus mode with a friend? I want to see what kind of character they've built, and I want to see how they fight, but I can't. For a PC exclusive fighting game, this is completely absurd.Despite the glaring flaws in the game's design, however, I still had a crapload of fun with Megabyte Punch. The game's customization and two singleplayer game modes add a ton of replay value to the game, especially if you like to experiment with building new characters. If you're a fan of Super Smash Bros. style fighting, Cave Story style exploration, and Custom Robo style character building, I seriously suggest you play this game.Oh yeah, and when the wise old robot tells you to seek out Three Flowers, keep in mind that they're stacked vertically. Now go kick some walking robo-heads!"

76561198049274219,Recommended,248550,14642887,"Posted: 24 February, 2015",all,LastRaven,"What I love about this game is that it takes the essence of Super Smash Bros. with the customization of Custom Robo and then adds a little Mega Man like Story Mode where you collect parts and alternate color schemes. If you have ever played SSB and felt that you could never find a character that fit welll, now you can make one. The game use a similar control scheme where you have the standard or ""A"" button attacks and then depending on what parts you equip you can add your special attacks/abilities or ""B"" Button moves. You can even change which direction you use for the move combo to your own liking. There are plenty of parts to choose from, once you unlocked them of course. The only issue I have is that there is a lack of size cusomiztion, being able to change your character's size would help give the game more of a SSB vibe as that ga,me has heavy to light characters which affect speed and knock out. Despite that, you will have plenty of options to choose from, such as Powerful Uppercuting Fist to legs that boost speed to cores that boost shielding ability to Shoulders that give you extra jumps and the effects can be foud on multiple part types or sometimes on the same part type but in a different look, which is makes the customizing easier both functionally or comsemticly.The only concerns are the lack of online multi player and the tournament mode where the CPU players must be made out  of a dense alloy as they can still remain in the battle despite having 300 damage but you little robo will have a hard time staying once it has 100 damage; they also must have been modeled on that one guy who spams the same moves as they love to and will not hesitate to use the same move repeatedly.PROS:- Runs Great, no bugs or crashing- Lots of variety in Character Customization- Adventure Mode is fun with secrets to find and parts to unlock- Tournament Mode is a good test of skill (or of how cheap you robo's fighting style is)CONS:- Tour. Mode CPU needs to be brought back to Earth (So when I uppercut them at 200 DMG they go flying)- Tour. Mode CPU need to be more randomize, fighting the same Bots can be annoying (Looking at you Drill Guy)- Lack of on Online FeaturesConclusion:Worth the small amount of money if you love any of the above mentioned games."

,Recommended,248550,8791857,"Posted: 20 January, 2014",all,Dr. Cuckcakes,"Megabyte Punch is a fighting/beat 'em up game Developed by Reptile. I literally heard nothing about this game untill I found the Steam page for it, watched the video, and bought the game on sale. Was it worth my money? For the most part, I found the game pretty fun. There are three different game modes to play: story mode, tournament, and versus mode. The story takes place in a computer world where the heartcore, the giver of life in your village and world, is stolen by a corrupted empire. You play as a robot fighter, fighting off the empire and saving your village from destruction. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the Super Smash Brothers series, as you have basic attacks as well as powerful attacks meant to knock back enemies, but there's a twist. Enemies in the game are made up of different robot parts that can be dropped upon defeating them. See an enemy with a cannon arm? Beat him up, and if it drops, its yours to equip. Parts range from movement buffs, to extra defense, to special attacks, and it's interesting to come up with different combinations to make your character the way you want. You can even find hidden color capsules to personalize your robot even more! Boss fights are similar to a regular match in SSB, where you rack up damage on your opponent to knock them off the stage. Defeating bosses will give you new parts you only catch a glimpse of from common enemies, which makes it all the more satisfying to use the part back on them. The gameplay, while fun, can get repetetive after a while. most of the enemies are no threat at all, being easily knocked into a bundle and shot off by your power attack or rockets, and some of the platforming can be a bit frustrating at times. The visuals are simplistic, bearing resemblence to polygons and geometric figures, but it's very colorful and charming. Combining this with the great soundtrack creates some interesting themes in the stages and areas of the game. Really, my only main complaint with the game is the multiplayer. Have you always wanted to have SSB-like battles with your friends over the internet on your PC? Well, you'll be severely dissapointed, because this game only has local multiplayer. That means your friends have to come to your house and play the game there. Also, unless you've played the main game for a decent amount of time, you won't have any parts to customize your robot with for multiplayer. Overall, If you like customizable robots and SSB adventure mode, you'll like this game. If you want a good multiplayer game for steam and don't like playing fighting games by yourself, I would skip this game."

Being a child of three awesome parents (Castlevania, Megaman and Super Smash Bros Meele), it would be near perfect and over the top. But I'll get into that. Let's kick some cyber butts!The story is kind of cool, yet really easy to work out. Someone wants your village cyber-core (or whatever) and you need to protect it (or whatever). Meanwhile, after kicking some asses somebody stoles it (or whatever) and it happens to be the most obvious villain in the game. That's the whole plot, no kidding.Controls are good. Of course I'm playing on keyboard, so it's far from perfect, but they are fluent and responsive. The fast paced action, as fast as it could be, doesn't cripple keyboarders, which is also nice.Gameplay is really basic, but fun. You run around, punch some robots in the face, collect parts and occasionally color schemes. The posibilities are of course limited, but you can make a Megac (thats the official name) just whatever you want it to be. As long as it's bipetal humanoid.Graphics are well done, kind of clunky and polygon, just like in old imagining of late 80's and early 90's about future games. It's nice, old-school, and doesn't give you a feeling, that you need to put something in your eyes (a screwdriver for example).Music is in pair with graphics. Kind of clunky yet strangely well made and vigorous. Another job well done.Okay, now, why it would be great and not is? Well, the game is almost officialy dead. There was no update since forever, because developers, after hoarding cash decided, that they need to make a sequel. Not, that I'm against it, but devs of Terraria for instance can do both. It's kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-much behaviour in my opinion, but hell, the game is great.Okay, last word. Buy this game. If you have friends, then play with them either on split screen (kinda) or over IP.

A few quirks lend to the indie feel of the game, and some people might find these frustrating.A layout for seeing what you've collected and what your missing would be nice, along with the ability to save/load between each level. Besides these sort of expected issues that come along with indie games the only other thing I would mention is the lack of online multiplayer. The plethora of unique parts for your megac, along with the quirky, and stylish colors you can collect make your character feel unique, and your own. Each of the six levels you can play through are different and offer the player a variety of challenges and mechanics to explore. Bosses and the tournament are challenging and often times even frustrating, but its in a good way, trust me.All in all;if your looking for a local multiplayer game that feels like mega man, plays like a traditional smash bros game, and gives you a modest set of customization for your character, then Megabyte Punch will tickle your fancy.

Comparing the game to Smash Bros. doesn't seem like a wise thing to do, but it's hard to resist for most. While this game is significantly more simple, it's probably for the best if you're playing with a keyboard. Gamepads aren't something everyone has, after all. In conclusion, the gameplay is excellent, despite how it had to be keyboard-friendly since a gamepad isn't something everyone like me owns.Customization? In some cases, there's not quite much, but in other cases, there's plenty of it. There are different parts you can use as heads, arms, legs, etc. that give you special attacks, while other parts simply raise your stats such as damage, movement speed, armour, and attack speed. However, even though reskins can be acceptable, there are just a little too many bearing the same ability, such as the teleport. It's also really easy to use these abilities to take advantage of how dumb the AI is in some cases, making them considerably overpowered. You can use the sniper arm to repeatedly back an enemy into a wall, dealing quite some damage with each shot. You can also use the slice dash move to dash back and forth across an enemy, knocking them straight into the air and landing back down just in time for you to dash again. There are even a few cheap attacks the enemy can spam at you, the main offenders being the blaster or the drill, which are definitely noticable in the tournament.While we're stepping into the gripes, I'll address my biggest; wasted potential. This game had a chance to become the perfect PC variation of Super Smash Bros, but its severe lack of content is a big glaring issue. The biggest, though; no online multiplayer? Now, I understand that this was made by only 2 people who claim to have no networking knowledge, but come on! A game like this justscreamsonline multiplayer!So in conlusion, this game issomewhatworth the price, but I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a fun time-waster that lasts a long time. In fact, it's possibly the best single-player time waster there is. Kind of awkward in some places, but still a great game."

Mine were as follows: ""Oh boy, this game looks like a lot of fun, the single player looks like a good way to introduce players to mechanics in the game, while also allowing you to upgrade and create a more versitle character that fits your style of fighting games, and the multiplayer looks like it plays like Super Smash Bros. Sign me up."" And while all this holds true, there's a few glaring flaws the game has. Let's start with the good.Positives:-The game's graphics are really colorful and I rather enjoy them. I'm no expert on frame rates, but I can say the game ran smoothly, and I haven't encountered any hickups in frame rates.-The gameplay is fast and fun, and I can see the multiplayer being a blast if you have more than one controller and have friends willing to play.-The controls are tight, and responsive, and are customizable for the different move sets you want to perform.-The single player campaign is also quite fun, having a variety of stages, and the main hub is a lot of fun to explore and find secret color upgrades, that don't do much beyond changing the color variation of your character.Of course, as fun as the game is, there's a few problems that need to be addressed.Negatives:-First off, there's no online multiplayer. I feel like in this day and age, fighting games released via pc's really don't have much of a reason to not use some form of online multiplayer or co-op, especially with the ability for people open ports, meaning the development team doesn't need to pay for server fees. The lack of this means you have to have friends and extra controllers to really enjoy the multiplayer aspect of the game.-With that being said, the only thing left for you to do is the single player, which can become rather stale after a while. Even though each stage is structurally different, you'll find it monotonous after a while running through and beating up bad guys to get to one boss fight. Also, there's no check points in the worlds, meaning if you lose all your lives half way through a stage, you'll then have to start all over from the beginning of the world.Overall:Overall, this game is a lot of fun, but can end up tiring you out after a while. I would suggest picking this game up if you have friends who would like to play it with you, but if you're like me and were expecting an online feature, then I'd say pass, cause the single player campaign isn't enough to hold you over for long, especially for the price tag. (I still recommend it though.)"

In this mode you can build your own megac with the parts you can earn while passing trough different levels (Each level contain 3 stages and one boss). The parts can serve to improve the megac's skills or provide special attacks/movements (like fireballs, flying, uppercut etc..).The Fight Mode permits to literally fight with other megacs with the robot you built. Both of the modes can be played in local multiplayer, wich is very fun.+ First of all, the gameplay mixes fighting and platform with a good maniability.+ Then, the graphics brings originality with different forms and colours that makes it look like fireworks.+ Moreover, we can appreciate the high quality of the musics in the game.+ There's also a lot of collectables (Megac's parts, Megac's colours).+ The possibility to build our own robot is cool, we can decide how the megac will look and how it will attack- Even if a level has only 3 stages, these stages are really long and if we lose all our lifes on a stage, we got to restart the whole level again.- It would be appreciated to have more unique parts and special attacks.- Personnaly, I am waiting for an online mode, it could be really fun.To put it in a nutshell, Megabyte Punch is a great game and its price is very attractive for what it offers. There is no hesitation about it, it's a very good game and if you're not sure, just wait for sales and you'll be pleased.(I am just giving my point of view about this game.

Gameplay is fast and smooth, like cutting butter with a warm knife, while early game can be almost a cake walk (as expected), the final levels will force you to play better if you want even a chance to win, but man, does it feel great beating that final boss.Local multiplayer may not be everyone's cup of tea in an online focused era, but I would still recommend the game if only for the singleplayer content. Eight battles against AI opponents to win special parts, whose difficulty rivals even that of the final boss, and six levels to explore with six bosses to defeat, and more secret levels.150 parts are advertised, though there's more like 20ish abilities, this isn't bad as it offers the player a lot of choice to customise their character to have the abilities and looks they want, and 30 color schemes to choose from. I also discovered what I think is a bug with the color selecter. Now normally it paints all your parts, but it doesn't paint ones already in your inventory before the color was chosen, this can be used to combine many different colors and parts to make a truely unique character.Story is alright, though I don't play games for a story, that's what a book is for. It contains some humor, and references to computer technology.Overall, I'll rate Megabyte Punch a 10/10, I would gladly play through the adventure again."

The developers seem to realize that the controls are incredibly difficult to use with any degree of precision because it seems that they have designed the levels and the combat AI to take advatage of this.Examples:Damage Plate environmental hazards that send you pinballing around the level if you so much as brush against one, placed where you would have to have precise control to get through them without dying or getting bounced back to the start half-dead.  The controls are the type where if you try to turn around you end up sprinting in the opposite direction.The combat AI spams quick special attacks and regular attacks like a 6 year old in a fighting game.  Just sitting in the corner spamming ranged attacks so that you can't get to it.  The melee variants aren't any better as the computer doesn't have the controls to contend with and can just jump right behind you and start pummeling you while you're still locked in the delay after an attack.  Not that they need to do that.  Almost any enemy attack seems to cancel out any attack you're in the middle of, even at the point of contact.  You can be in the middle of attempting a combo and start getting annihilated like you were standing still.  I say attemping a combo because every attack in this game has a delay either before or after it's performed, so there really isn't any way to chain a combo.  It's all hit and run tactics, which makes every fight, through every level drag on."

However, when you start playing, you immediatelyfeelthe problems with this game. While there was potential, it just did not make it.The controls are the first thing that you know is wrong with this game. They are clunky and unforgiving. You never know when you will be allowed to perform certain actions, such as a double jump, until you try. By controls, however, I mean the friction and the responsiveness of pressing the buttons. It was the entire feeling of this character who appeared to be fast, but felt like he was trudging through a swamp.The enemies were also far more of a nuisance than a threat. Every time I punched one of them, they would fly a few screens away. I don't even know if they did any damage!Bugs were another problem with this game. I somehow managed to punch a character through the entire flooring of the level all the way to to the bottom. As cool as it looked, it turned out that was not actually supposed to happen. Had I not had wings to fly back to the area, I would have been forever screwed. That of course was only one of the bugs I ran across, but hopefully you see my point.It was at that point that I decided I just couldn't stomach it any further (about 30 minutes in). I was really hoping that it would get better. I did really like that there were a lot of options to customize your character and there were a lot of really greatideasin there, but the game needs to befinishedfirst. Until then, I would say don't bother."

The worse thing about bad controls is it's really hard to explain so i'll give my best to but it won't be an accurate description: For starters you can only have 3 abilities which you can slot in certain directions for example up, down and left + Right. You then have to be pressing in that direction in order to use the ability so if i had teleport on UP i would press UP + Special how ever if i wanted to teleport to the right i have to pull off an extremely tricky UP + Special into the direction i want to use. If you're a second too late it doesn't work and you often find yourself doing one of the other two abilities you have slotted half of the time and the other half you'll find yourself teleporting up. Why does it have to be like that? Why can't you just have the abilities slotted into different keys then press the key to select the ability then press special to execute it. Then you would be able to do the ability in any direction you wanted but no you can't do it like that because that would make sense!To do a combo attack you have to be stood still and press the attack key how ever when you're running at an enemy and pressing the attack key it does a heavy attack flinging the enemy away from you so you can't get an extra hit and end up doing minimal damage. Now if you run up to an enemy and stop in order to do a combo the enemy will just hit you first and combo you so you don't want to do that because this will get you killed so the battles end up taking way too long because you can't maximize damage or dealing combos without the risk of getting hit yourself.I don't know if these are issues when using a controller and i highly doubt they are because it feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port."

If you don't or if you need a bit of a refresher: Medabots were robots that were acclaimed for their customizability. Within the games, you were able to change out each arm, each leg, the chest, the head, the hip, and even their power medals. Every piece you changed gave that medabot a different ability, whether it was a passive like increasing their attack power or it was an active like the ability to do a powerslide. You could piece together a tank medabot, with actives and passive that supproted the generally slower and bulkier parts. Or you could make a speedy medabot, with parts that quadrupled its speed, but made it very fragile. Another piece of the game was how you gained parts: by beating your opponent and randomly taking one of the defeated medabots' peices. But if you lost, you lost one of your pieces. It made each battle exciting and very competitive among friends. Now, take all of that, give it updated graphics and stuff it into a platformer and you have Megabyte Punch. Although the game could be a new remake of Medabots in a different genre, it is still a tremendous amount of fun, especially with friends. With that being said, MP (Megabyte Punch) has a few minor flaws that culminate to knock it down from a perfect score. The levels being to feel a bit repetative, even if they are still entertraining enough to keep you going. The bosses are pretty hard (only because they are ungodly spammy), which is weird after extremely easy build-up levels. And the final flaw is something so simply fixed that it pains me to have to bring it up: hit-boxes. While most are okay, some of the moves have really annoying and off hit-boxes, screwing up those perfect and delicious combos that the game allows for. One move that always messes up my juggle combos is the up-basic attack, as the hit-box is only on the side you are facing, making the juggle much harder than it should be.Even with the minor flaws, this game still stands tall as a monument of customization. It fights like Super Smash Bros with more combos and (unfortunately) more spam. Either way, try this game.

This game is an utter delight and truly a hidden gem in the sea of Steam.The presentation of the game is stellar. I'm astounded by the level of finese Reptile managed to achieve with the free version of the Unity engine. This game has a bright, colorful aesthetic with really nice looking robot models and an old-school feel to level design that screams ""1990's side scroller"". The music is wonderful, and it all gels together amazingly.The gameplay is nothing to snuff at either. The game is split into two modes of play: the side scrolling stage-based Adventure mode, and the stationary Smash Bros. style Fight mode. Adventure mode feels a lot like Mega Man, where you go between battle rooms defeating enemies and work your way to the end of the stages. There are six levels with three stages per level and a boss fight at the end of each. You defeat enemies by building up damage on them ala Smash Bros, then using a powerful attack to send them flying at killing speed towards a wall. Enemies will often carve deep into walls, giving you a real feeling of impact as their bodies slice through the terrain of the level that is truly satisfying. As you progress, often doors will lock you into a small arena where you need to defeat multiple enemies before proceeding, which also spawns a checkpoint if you die. Along your path, you will find two kinds of collectable. The first thing you get are Bits, which can be collected for an extra life, 64 netting you a 1-up, and after each level Bits can be spent in the store to obtain rare parts. Speaking of which, your other collectables are a plethora of robot parts, each one having different properties you can get by adding them to your robot in real-time. When you pick up a part, you get the option to attach it to your robot immediately as you play through the stage, letting you not only see and apply your own progression, but also giving you an immense amount of autonamy with what upgrades you want to apply. The part system lets you really choose what kind of play-style you want to go for. There are 150 parts to collect total, each giving you a variety of stat boosts and special attacks, so go nuts.After you're done with the Adventure mode, you can play in the Fight mode. The goal in Fight mode is to build up damage on your enemies then send them flying off the stage, like Smash Bros except with the customization of Custom Robo. There are two ways to play in the fight mode, the first being a Versus with 2 to 4 local players (no bots), or in an 8-round 1v1 tournament against a series of 8 bots. The Versus mode is rioutous fun to play with friends, and if you can hook your PC into a TV it can literally be fun for hours. After showing it to my personal friends, I've had testimony that this game is better than Smash Bros. While I don't necessarily agree, the appeal of the multiplayer is apparent. The other mode that can be played in Fight is the Tournament mode. The goal is to defeat 8 consecutive AI opponents, all randomly drawn from a pool of pre-built opponents. You can switch your build in between each round, and it plays much like Brawl's All-Star mode where you must defeat each opponent with only a limited number of lives in order to achieve victory. Placing in the top four nets you bonus Bits to spend in the shop, which is extremely useful for getting some of the rarer parts, and getting first place nets you rare parts.This game is truly great, but it definitely has problems. First, customizing your robot can be fairly slow, as you have to page through 15 pages of parts, 10 parts per page, with no decent organization. Given, the parts are arranged into categories by a sort of soft transition, but it would have been nice to see the parts be separated into different scrolling pages based on the part category, to speed up the sorting process. The second major problem that this game has is that there's no way to play free rounds of Fight mode against a number of AI bots. If you want to play alone, all you have is Adventure and Tournament; playing in a 4-player free-for-all requires you to have 3 friends lying about, and there's no online to fill in the gaps. Third, the game's AI can be a little predictable at points. I found it easy to exploit AI behavior in certain ways, such as spamming ranged shots to build damage without having to move whatsoever, and the AI would just walk into the shots instead of trying to shield and jump away from my line of fire. Fourth, it would have been nice to see a little more part variety. I know, there's 150 parts in the game, but many of the parts are simply aesthetic changes. However, the variety is a very minor complaint as there's quite a bit of variety in there and many parts share stat boosts in order to build robots in certain ways, but it just gets under my skin. And finally, farming to get all the parts is a pain, some of the parts seem to have horribly low drop-rates. As a player who's sole goal is to make his multiplayer games completely multiplayer ready by having everything available, this irked me.All-in-all, this game is great, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat, and I'm surprised it managed to go under the radar like it did. This game is one that will even make non-gamers entertained, and it's great for parties. If you haven't gotten it, get it now. For all it's small flaws, this game is truly great and will be an excellent addition to your library. Just make sure you get some controllers and friends to truly get the full experience."

Megabyte Punch is a good old beat em up adventure game thats basically a mixure of the Super Smash Bro games and Custom Robo. It has the same fighting element as the Super Smash Bro games like the damage meter. The higher the enemies damage is, the easier it will be to either kill them or laumch them off screen and kill them. However there is no way to heal yourself other than dying. Its also got a Super Mario component to it where if you collect 64 Bits in adventure mode, you get an extra life. As for your character itself this is where the Custom Robo part come in to play. In Custom Robo, you can collect parts that can give you stat boosts or new attacks and abilities. Megabyte Punch does the exact same thing. Each part can either increase your stats or give you a new attack and you can obtain new parts by either winning tournament mode, defeating enemies in adventure mode, or buying them from the shop in adventure mode.. I absolutely LOVE this game and have been dying to get my hands on it ever since I saw Jesse Cox from OMFGcata do a review of it the game way back when it was still on Steam Greenlight. I have spent nearly 40 Hours playing this game.The only complaint that I have with the game is that it has local multiplayer instead of online multiplayer. If the creators could add online multiplayer to it so that you can play adventure mode, tournament, and versus with friends online, it would be even better.

,Recommended,248550,19340243,"Posted: 28 November, 2015",all,Christopher,"Megabyte Punch is the love-child of Mega Man and Super Smash Brothers, and does both parents proud.I bought the game entirely on a whim and I am so glad I did as it has rapidly taken a place among my favorite games of all time. A little bit about where I'm coming from: I'm a 30-something that grew up on side-scrolling platformers like the original Mega Man series for NES as well as couch coop beat-em ups like Streets of Rage.  Very few games can scratch that itch these days, and this game manages to do that with an engaging adventure mode which has you working your way through various open ended stages and an arena mode with some of the most satisfying competitive play you'll find anywhere. Both modes can be played with between 1-4 players so grab your friends, a controller, a beer and be prepared to be entertained.The combat is very much like Smash Brothers in that you don't just die after receiving a set amount of damage. Instead, the more damage you take makes it easier for you to be flung further and faster with each hit you take. Take a hit that launches you into a wall hard enough or off the stage and you blow up spectacularly. I cannot stress enough how satisfying it is to roundhouse kick an enemy through a wall and watch him break into bits on the rock behind it. This goes doubly so for launching your friend's character into orbit when they are sitting next to you on the couch and you can observe their reaction in real time!The adventure mode's premise is that you are a digital being call a ""Megac"" born from something of a super computer called the Heartcore to protect your village. You quest through various large stages, each with multiple paths to the finish and a reasonable difficulty curve. Exploration is both highly encouraged and rewarded with goodies being hidden in unorthodox places that the keen observer (or just plain lucky) will find. As you destroy enemies there is a chance that they will drop one of their ""parts"" similar to how Mega Man can absorb defeated bosses powers but with a much higher degree of customization. As a Megac, you can take those parts and customize yourself on the fly creating various builds you can switch as the need arises. Your Megac is made up of a head, shoulders, core, hips, two arms and two legs. Each one of these can be customized making for characters that play wildly different from eachother. These parts can either buff a particular attribute of your Megac or provide a special ability. Bosses at the end of stages make for good challenges as well as dropping rare parts unique to them.Multiplayer is an arena affair with all of your custom Megacs squaring off in a variety of floating platforms. All of the combat mechanics are the same, although certain parts become more useful in this setting than the adventure mode. A very skilled player will have no issues using any of the parts, however.From a mechanical standpoint, the first time I booted up the game the controls felt a little ""floaty."" I realized that the reason for this is the game defaults to using an analog stick for movement which is different from my Mega Man/Smash Brothers muscle memory I have built up over the years by using the d-pad.  Having that much more throw in the control does take some getting used to and I suspect is the reason that some of these reviews say the platforming could use some work. Once you adapt to the difference or change your controls, you are fine.For all that is great there are some criticisms I can level at the game. The elephant in the room is a lack of online multiplayer. At the time of development Team Reptile (who would later go on to make Lethal League) made the choice to forego online functionality as they weren't sure they could implement it to the standard the rest of the game was made. I'd love to see them revisit this title and add it now, as they most certainly have the expertise to do so. Also, there is the issue of unlocking parts. If you just buy this game now and sit down with your friends to play, you will have almost no parts to make your Megacs with because they are unlocked via the adventure mode. A ""free vs."" mode would have solved this issue entirely.All in all, I can't recommend this game enough if you are okay with the caveats I have listed above. 9/10"

But I feel the game shines the most in story mode, especially in co-op.For one, the levels are very non-linear. I'd kind of equate it similarly to old-school Sonic the Hedgehog levels, in which the ending may be in the same spot, but there are a vast array of ways to get to that end.There are a plethora of paths and secrets, most of the secrets may just be hidden money capsules or part, but the fact that there are so many well hidden things encourages you to explore these well-designed levels even more. There's also colors you can find to change the appearance of your robot more, which is heckin stylish.The actual fighting is as you probably know, very similar to super smash bros but simpler. Due to the fighting not being very complex this might be a turn-off for you, but I found it to be very satisfying. The moves are meaty (even though you're a robot) and have a lot of impact.Finally, the customization is pretty nice. Finding a new part to equip to your robot that may give you a sweet new move or maybe you want a loadout that allows for 4 extra jumps! I do wish there was a bit more variety in the amount of moves though, as there's ""only"" around 15 or so.Overall, I'd highly reccomend this game. I feel not many people praise the game for its levels whereas that's what me and my friend liked the most about it. A very nice adventure-fighting experience that shines more in co-op."

Yeah, lack of online multiplayer is a drag, but since the playstyle is familiar you should be able to find people who can pick up on it quickly locally (and the singleplayer is good enough on its own anyway, way better than most fighting game story modes).Whereas the Smash Bros franchise has more of a floating, bouncy feel to it, Megabyte Punch is tight and snappy. It's a lot more satisfying, and seems to make it easier to work with the trajectory a robot takes when it’s been punched into a stage hazard (or wall, or other robot, or a projectile you previously fired). Keeping an enemy juggled by knocking them around like anime jai alai is the best.They also did a good job of balancing the customization system. You can be loaded with recovery-focused moves and nothing else, or be a zero-abilities tank, and it all feels fair. There are a few really bad builds you could make, but by and large, no matter how stupid you want your fighter to be/look, it'll be fun to play."

Megaman style story mode with 4 player local coop is great. Verses is good, but it needs online multiplayer, at this point it probably wont get updated. Controler support can be a pain to set up. But after i got it working it stayed working.Theres 150 parts, so clearly there will be duplicates with different looks.

Multiplayer Adventure especially.- Versus is enjoyable, when enough parts have been made available via Adventure to lend builds some variety.- Custom bots means your bot suits your play-style, skills on your designated inputs rather than based on equip slot.CONS:- Adventure Mode: When another player kicks the bucket, they are out for that entire adventure. No way to give one of your lives to bring them back into the action, even if you are sitting pretty with a surplus.- Walljump: Jumping off of walls is simple, just bump your stick over. No need to Direction+A. However, more often than not this screws you in tight situations where you need to be agile while falling down a narrow shaft. Get too close to a wal and bump over, you've just flung yourself towards that red-hot damagepad and hurled yourself into a world of hurt, or worse. A simple choice in the input options to make walljump require Direction+A would fix this issue.- Controller per Player: Need to go into options and designate who gets what controller number. The game doesn't have a bot select screen on startup to detect what player is using what controller.OVERALL:I'd highly recommend it. Having a blast in Adventure right now, and Versus should be better once we have more parts and colors unlocked. Great couch co-op/multiplayer game. If you are playing solo, I'd imagine it would lose some of its attraction (at least, it does for me. Then again, I do mostly multiplayer, so tastes will vary).If you are looking for a title to play with friends couch-side, one that can be both co-op and competitive, this is a great title for that. I have over thirty five couch games, and this easily rocketed to the top five. Easy to pick up (Smash Bros is a good analogy for Versus and Boss Battles), concept is simple (It's an adventure-platformer/beat-em-up), and the customization to make your very own fighting robot to fight with, or against, your friends is great fun. Both Adventure and Versus (with adequate parts available) are easy to jump into and run with, as well as hop out of (bits and parts are saved even if you wipe in an Adventure Level).Rating: 9/10( 10/10 if Adventure Resurrection is added in later. It's just a bummer to blow up and have to sit there watching the rest of the crew play on without you, despite someone having a pile of lives they'll never use. )"

Gear Up, combined together, this is your poison.Although a local-only game for multiplayer, parts balance is quite cautious and difficulty of the adventure mode varies in the AI of opponent, as there isn't a ""stright upgrade"" of a specific part. The more you unlock, the greater flexibility you have when assembling your fighter. The further you go, the harder must you think of a good strategy, coordination of your parts, or combos to work with.6 levels with 4 stages in each, the gamplay was not very long, but solid enough for new playthroughs with friends. Hidden content-wise isn't very rich, but are challenging and rewarding.Pro tip: If you want to play the game from the start, but keep all your parts, there is the Destructo-Cheat. In the main menu, hold CTRL, ENTER and DELETE, you should hear a conformation. If you want to wipe your save completely, use the Hyper-Destructo-Cheat (in the main menu, hold CTRL, BACKSPACE and DELETE). (fromhttp://www.desura.com/games/megabyte-punch/news/megabyte-punch-smooth-update)I am planning to have a new playthrough with 3 friends keeping the unlocked colors, where the parts and story progress are deleted.

It showed potential when I first started playing it. I recently picked it up again, but found myself wanting for the end to come; the ingame credits or otherwise.PROS:-The Super Smash Bros. style combat system works fairly well, with the player being able to smash their opponents into the wall or off the stage.-The game is of average length.-The parts system is easy to understand, intuitive and interesting.-Part designs are interesting and varied.-There is a stage editor.CONS:-Stages can be 1/2~1 hour long.-There are no checkpoints in any stage except for the boss at the end, so if you lose all of your lives, you'll have to start the entire stage all over again. (which leads to artificial playtime extension)-I've played through the entire game yet still have no clue what the story is.-The final boss is frustrating, with absolutely no payoff after killing him.-Sometimes, you will die because the controls fail you.-Wall jumping is useful on a keyboard, but definitely not on a controller.Overall, the game is OK, but not worth a buy unless A) you're a fanatic of Smash Bros.-style games or B) it's super cheap.---PRE-ENDGAME REVIEW POSTED JULY 14, 2016 [Positive]---Think of Super Smash Bros. Then think of buttloads of customizibility and destructible terrain.

,Recommended,248550,33440676,Posted: 10 July,all,Syrsly,"Couch coop PC Smash Bros. adventure mode with robots!Megabyte Punch is like that dream of a Super Smash Bros. game that only had adventure mode and had tons of unlockables for you to customize your character and move set with.  The controls are tight, doing away with charge attacks and instead opting for animation time to execute attacks.  It provides room for 4 players to play on one screen with Xbox 360/One controllers (or whatever controllers, if you're ok with mapping buttons).  It gives you a story, but it's not really about its story as much as it's about collecting and equipping parts.  You'll mostly just want to skip enemies at first, but later, you will find that skipping enemies makes you miss out on parts you would have found if you defeated more enemies in each level and found more loot chests.Yes, there's loot, but it's not as RPG-like as you may expect.  It's more like a move set you can customize and a skin that's equally customizable though not purely for cosmetic purposes.  If you equip a certain part, it unlocks abilities, but if you want to look a certain way that another part allows, you'll have to choose one or the other.  This isn't necessarily bad, because it would be silly to do drill moves, for example, without a drill.Get this game asap.  It's worth full price.  Get it for coop or enjoy it solo.  Either way, it's worth the $15 full price."

It doesn't have a huge amount of depth in it and the story isn't exactly what I'd call ""compelling"" as there are no actual characters.What is very good is the combat mechanics. Every piece of equipment is good for different situations. Mainly, you will find one set that will be slightly modified to fit your playstyle. There will be levels though that you have to switch up your playstyle because it doesn't work. For example, in the last level, my mobile glass-cannon style of play wasn't working, so I had to switch to full armored tank with a huge rocket launcher, and it worked fantastically. Another boss fight I had to switch to a full speed upgrade and attack speed with only one ability in order to defeat the boss.There are a couple enemy AI exploits that could make the game boring if you bought into them, but as long as you don't actively try to exploit, you shouldn't notice AI quirks much. The colors are all very well done, and give a sense of accomplishment.While I'm not sure what replayability it has, it is a very good game and worth the 50% off that I got for sure!"
