,Recommended,248570,30192045,Posted: 26 February,all,TehNecr0,"I've played this game quite a lot in the past before it was released to Steam. By no means was I good, especially since the game has a rather large learning curve. This learning curve comes from the fact that various joints must be manipulated to get results, but casual players (especially friends) will often find hilarity due to the manipulation of their characters sometimes in rather awkward positions. Multiplayer games are rather fast-paced compared to singleplayer sessions due to the timer which limits the time players can think before it runs out. Otherwise, various mods come with the game which adds plenty of PvP options (arena type, weapons, body sensitivity, etc.), or solo challenges (parkour, skateboarding, sports, etc.).In terms of play by more seasoned/veteran players (not including myself), other players can find interest in the rather complicated techniques used to simulate real fights or complete parkour maps.Overall, this game takes a long time to fully understand since the tutorial does not completely cover everything, but once players get past this, they'll find many challenges to overcome."
