,Recommended,248630,7743973,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,charles,"I'm a sucker for PVP melee combat games that involve both mind games and skill to win. I bought this game on a whim because I had nothing else much to play after I watched the trailer. it seemed very similar to Dark Souls and I was especially intrigued in the spells + sword fighting gameplay.First thought was, ""damn, why is this game so bright?"" but the game is beautiful. Some things aren't texturized that well and the game is full of glitches, bugs and inconsistencies but that is what an early access is about. Things will be fixed and as of yesterday, a patch has already been released acknowledging many inconsistencies and imbalances.Using the mouse to aim the direction of sword swings isn't unheard of, but I think the game does it well, and with the addition of bows, throwing axes, mines and magical spells, it adds alot of depth to the game. Discovering what types of spells go with which swords or abilities is fun and experimental and there are many different combinations to tinker with.All in all, I think this game has so much potential right now. If FlyLeaps studios could make the sword play a little more responsive, (sometimes, hits do not register), add a duel-mode similar to that of chivalry, and some more content (including more spells, swords, maps etc.) this game will be big hit that will most likely appeal to a competitive community."

No matter the server one player always had higher ping, and this enabled them to dominate all as there was no way to defend against attacks since the ping delayed you too much for it to even register a block.It's a awesome concept, but to have a intricate battle system you also need the netcode or servers to back it up."

,Recommended,248630,11081116,"Posted: 5 July, 2014",all,Murukai#1485  <-- Overwatch,"First off I would like to say that I've been playing this game since the beginning and have literally not stopped playing. If what you're looking for is a multiplayer melee experience similar to that of war of the roses or mount & blade, but set in a fantasy world where you control magic at your fingertips, then look no further. This game really delivers, for an alpha.The updates in this game take awhile since there are only two devs working on the game and they do aim for monthly updates, doesn't always happen but they do let us know what is going on. As I have said the game is still in alpha and will have some bugs here and there. Playing with a low ping is highly recommended. Anything over 130 (in game not in the server menu) is not very playable.Right off the bat you are able to customize your knight in some impressive fantastical armor and clothing, but there are also choices for some more 'realistic' gear. Devs are adding new things all the time and are always showing off their progress on the Kingdoms Rise facebook page.As of right now there isn't a tutorial in-game, but one can be seen in the guides section made by the devs. You don't need to look at the tutorial, but believe me when I say, at the very least look at the parry and parry lock section of the manual. It will save you a lot of grief in game and once you master those skills, gameplay becomes even more addicting. You can get away with spamming away attack with other new players, but once you meet someone who knows how to parry, you will most likely lose. Luckily, those experienced few in the community are always willing to help out new players and usually it isn't too hard to ask these guys for some help.There are many different swords in the game, each with their special effects and stats. They aren't perfectly balanced, but your use in magic and skill with the sword is enough to offset any of the swords' abilities currently available. Magic in this game isn't over powered and is meant to be used to complement your swordsmanship as well as mold the playstyle you want. You can only equip 2 spells, however, you are able to have doubles of any spell as well as have a large selection to choose from. There are many types of spells from attack, to defense, to healing and mobility. Mix and match to create the playstyle you want.You will have a hard time at first controlling the sword with your mouse due to the nature of the screen moving with you as you strike, but like I said, look up the tutorials and get some practise performing the moves. They do require some timing and precision, so if an easy mode game is what you're looking for, then you are in the wrong place. However, if you're looking for a competetive game where the skill cap is high and it is very much possible for a skilled player to take on an entire team, without the use of cheap tricks/exploits, this game is for you.**AUGUST UPDATE**AI has been added to the game and makes for quite the training partners as well as a challenging surviving mode that will have you crying for mama within the first 5 waves. Really fun if you just want to mess around by yourself, or can't currently find a game. Just remember not to use the disonnect button while you're in the survival server as it will crash the game"

That's not how 'business' works around EA titles, and you can clearly see you've earned a pretty harsh reputation from your community. Just my two cents out there. Don't leave us in the dark, because there are other EA titles that have done this. I have no idea if this game will even progress at all, since now you speak of a 'port'.

,Not Recommended,248630,8317783,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,Telchii,"Note: This review recaps my old review/experiences and then goes into more recent attempts at playing.One year ago, I was longing to experience Dark Souls, but couldn't due to hardware limitations. I began a quest of looking for a suitable hold-me-over and found Kingdoms Rise. Kingdoms Rise reminded of the combat experience I longed for- up close and personal melee combat with some ranged and magic attacks mixed in.After purchasing the game, I excitedly hopped in and was met with bugs and lack of features that killed the user experience (short recap: menus that didn't work, broken key bindings/controller support, no tutorials). As a new user, I was quickly turned off. As I tried playing, I became flustered with the lack of guidance and no tutorials to help me out.I did eventually find the video tutorials that the developer posted, but found it hard to implement these lessons against players with 20+ hours compared to my newbie self. As I tried to persist, I was put off by the bad GUI and lack of a tutorial.Players on community sites and Steam kept repeating that after about 10 hours of playing the kill cam, you would start to get better and that the bugs were not an issue. Ignoring the bugs issue, I was very put off by this. Call me weak or lazy, but I would rather not waste time (like my money) on a kill-cam simulator. In similar games, I was able to learn and start improving long before the 10 hour mark. Sadly, this was not the case with Kingdoms Rise.As I now review other reviews on Steam, I can see that I wasn't the only one that burned out shortly after starting the game. Between bugs and difficulty learning the new system, players gave up.------------------------------------------Nearly one year later, and a recently built new computer, the Black Friday/early Winter sale reminded me of this game. So, I redownloaded it and gave it another try.It is nice to finally see big bugs ironed out (menus function properly, controllers work, keybindings stick) and some areas of the game (practice range, menus, in game interface) improved.Sadly, the developers took too long with these changes and lost nearly the entire playerbase.On the server browser, I was presented with ~15 servers to choose from. Of all these servers and game modes, only one server had one person. Thinking it may be a bot/AFKer to draw people in, I decided to let the game find a match for me, hoping to find that one server that people were still playing on. I was given an empty server to fight NPCs on (alone) - which got old, fast.Wondering if it was just my luck with the match system, I hopped on a popular site with karma points to see what discussions were going on. What I saw was not pleasant. The latest post was 6 months ago, and the next post after that was 10 months ago. Many of the comments on Steam and this site call this game ""A quick cash grab by the developer"".It's sad to see a potentially great concept die out. Personally, I believe it is to blame for being released (even as an early access) too early and not enough speed from the developer.------------------------------------------Assumedly eager to make some money - which is very understandable - I feel like the developer rushed the publishing of this game. From my perspective, this effectively killed the game when the developer couldn't keep up. While it should be a topic of its own, I feel this is greatly to blame on Valve's allowance of Early Access games.Between the dead player base and the improvements, I'm torn between recommending this game or giving it a thums down. But, because of the dead player base (the key aspect that makes this game playable), I'm going to keep my thumbs down.As the game (hopefully) gets more exposure during the sales, I'll keep giving it more chances to see if the community sparks a bit and see just how much the game has ironed out. As I stated in my previous review, I'd love to give this game a thumbs up. It's a great concept. But right now, I simply can't."

Screw these devs and everything they stand for. Wish I could get my money backAside from this though, ill put my real review below.The gameplay itself is kind of fun, but thats only because the majority of the people who ussed to still play it refused to use the broken/buggy attacks that would make you nearly auto win the second you cast them, the sword combat is pretty buggy, but it has a solid feel to it and a distinct charm, the main problem though, is that its pretty buggy.The spells feel like they were implemented without any actual thought on how they would influence your sword combat, and the synergy between spells and sword attacks feels very week, besides a select few spells that is.Also there are no players anymore, probably because of the reasons listed above, unless you like playing against bots, and only bots, then this is not the game for you.The devs also seem kind of childish, but I dont really have any other impressions of them to go off of besides them complaining towards people who gave negative reviews.The new update is silly, they are just adding back an old game mode that never should have been removed.If im going to be 100% with you, I feel this game would be really fun, even with the bugs, if the devs would actually get involved with the community, maybe organize some events and days where people can log on and know that there will be people to play against, if they did that I would probably give this game a really nice review, but this radio silence (Aside from them complaining to people who right negative reviews) just tells me that they dont care, or are to afraid of looking bad to say anything worth while.All in all the game itself is not bad, but due to the fact that there are NO players (In fact im writing this whole review in an empty lobby, seeing if anybody will join) I cannot reccomend this game unless you have a while entire lineup of friends ready to buy it as well and play with you. And even then I would only reccomend it on sale."

Introducing a perfect blend between magic usage and melee combat, it could arguably be considered the magical equivelant of the Chivalry series. The weapon conbat is fluent and precise, with parrying and blocking working efficiently and allowing for some truly awesome duels.Kingdoms Rise, though an awesome game has several flaws which hinder its sucess in the playability area. The foremost of which being a lack of players. Some games become simply outstanding when played on a full server, alas, Kingdoms Rise seldom presents the possibility for this. The game in its pre-release accomplished more by ways of player versus player melee combat than many other games have accomplished in their whole lifetime.Whether you play Kingdoms Rise for its awesome character customization, to blow your friends to pieces with fireballs, to teleport behind enemies and impale them on a blade of flames, Kingdoms Rise is for you.The only recommendation I offer to those playing it is to go in with an open mind. The game has its bugs, as one would expect from an early release game. Though any braincell-possessing human being can see the potential in this title. Regardless of what the game is like now, it leaves me and other players with a ready mind for the full release.When this game fully releases, it will be a game to remember.`Durzo Blint"

Combat is somewhat like Chivalry, only everyone's on equal ground and there are 8 swing/parry directions, as long as a clever parry locking system to raise the skill cap extremely high. There's also a ton of character and loadout customization, like magic! You can have 2 spells ranging anywhere from nukes, teleport, crowd control, magic immunity, healing, etc. and use any combination you like, as well a special slot that is used for a bow, mines, traps, throwing axes, what have you.There's a ton of game modes, ranging from huge FFA fights, organized duels, last-man-standing (Counter-Strike style), as well as a survival and practice mode.The learning curve is sharp, but it's getting better. They're adding a lot of features into the game to make it easier to understand what's going on, but even then a good swordsman can take you out pretty quickly. I had to pull a player aside, pull out training swords and get smacked for a while as he taught me before I understood what was going on. The game is extremely satisfying, and has a bright future.Even in it's early state, the devs have the genius and success of Kingdoms Collide behind them, and Kingdoms Rise is looking fantastic.If you read this review, and you're thinking about getting this game, send me a message on Steam.

Sure mashing is how you start out(probably), but when you learn how to block that's when the real fun starts. Locked in a swordfight where the smallest of mistakes can cost you your life. The spells add another layer to the fighting such as ice bolt which freezes the target for a short duration which leaves them defenceless against your sword swing, unless they dodge or neglect it with magic immunity or planeshift. In conclusion, a great game with a deep fighting system. Not to mention the awesome character costumization."

I've been eye-balling this game for the past few days and decided to get it and I'm not disappointed because this game delivers! The fun factor alone is good enough to buy this game, but then it also has beautiful landscapes, easy to play (for the most part; parrying is something I'm still working on), and nice character customization (even though it's not even done, it's still good for what it is).

By all means though, from watching vids and playing it, they didn't rip anything from the game or the ideas; it's no clone. It carries a certain aesthetic that ""it's a dark place that you want to be in because it's beautiful"" and the sword-play mechanics are pretty good.These are a few things I hope to see over time as the game develops:-Full graphics optimization (on a semi-decent rig, I still have to play in super low res).-Balancing out spells. Some spells make others irrelevant due to how OP they are atm.-More weapons, sidearms, and spells to flesh out more variety and strategies.-Make some clothing aspects react to the team color so it's easier to differentiate who's on who's team (I've killed countless allies by accident because they didn't look to be a teammate lol [sorry bros]).I know these would take even more time, but it would be cool too:-A developed story.-Single Player Adventure Mode... or something along those lines, maybe even with Co-Op._My Rig Specs_CPU: AMD Phenom 2 x4 945; 3 GHz rated @ 6.75 GHzRAM: 8 gbVideo Card: GeForce GT 610; 1gb VRAMOS: Win 7 Home Premium; 64-bitDirectX: 11Internet: Fiberoptic Connection"

Make sure you take this into account when analyzing the game yourself. Another thing that might initially be a turn-off is the lack of an active player-base meaning those trying to play the game solo won't get to do much playing, which is a shame because the gameplay is quite enjoyable despite all its buggy unfinished-ness.I have yet to play the game extensively, and I bought a four-pack for me and some friends so we've had someone to play with. What we have experienced is a genuinely fun melee-combat game, which is something we have been searching for for quite some time. The combat is visceral; every hit and parry feels great and the spells are a great way to add some flair to what would otherwise be just a sword-fighting game. There's plenty of variety of tactics that you can utilize to take down your opponents in creative ways by mixing sword-type with spell choice, and if you get tired of one build, just try another. Get a few people together and you'll have a lot of (admittedly unpolished) fun.If I were to compare this game to any others that I have played I would have to place it somewhere between Mount and Blade and Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. It has swordplay reminiscent of M&B and the magic/force powers of Jedi Academy, but the swordplay is more active than M&B and without all the confusing randomness (that I felt) in the lightsaber battles of JA.I hope you find this useful and would absolutely reccommend purchasing the game. Buying the game increases the player base and gives support to a game that has a lot of potential. Even though it is rough and incomplete, with support and patience I think this game could turn into something truly unique.Anyway, that's my impression. Take it as you will and with discretion; thank you for your time."

This also gets old within the first match or two as there is no minimap or even a real way to hear people coming up behind you.Graphically, the game feels a bit dated already, and due to the washed out color palette it can be difficult to even see other characters within parts of the battlefield.While the game is still in early access status, there are still noticeable elements such as keybinding bugs and extremely awkward sword swinging controls which can hamper combat even further.In short, the concept of the game is a very good one, but so far implementation leaves quite a bit to be desired. If you enjoy games such as Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, you may be disappointed as the pace of combat is almost slower than in oblivion or skyrim."

Dev is slow for updates (they come eventually), but there is no player base (or at least a constant one)Graphics: 8/10 | not the best ones still not bad at allGameplay: 10/10 | Really fun and skill-based gameplay, with customization of spells, secondary and primary weapon, for all kind of player (stealth, tank, archers, damage, sustain, etc)Sound and Music: 8/10 | Sounds and musica are just ok, still, at the end of the round (-1min left) epic music starts, there is when ecstasy comes.Story: No story, just fighting, do you even fit?I will recomend this game only if you want to play with friends, if not, dont waste your money."

I haven't played the game in recent months, or years, but I messaged the dev the other day after remembering this hidden gem.    He's getting ready to release a massive update as well as a console port (game is moving to Unreal Engine 4).I have high expectations for the update.Something he mentioned:  Players will be able to host servers (not sure if it's coming with this one, but it will happen.Now you can all stop complaining about there being no active servers for the game.  And since the game isn't abandoned, your other arguments about why you have a negative review are invalid.The developer is LITERALLY ONE PERSON.  Not a studio, not a team, just one guy.

The combat is a lot simpler, but there's nothing wrong with it necessarily. It's just ..simple.Pros:Spells provided lend to a huge variety in playstyles, keeping matches fresh and challenging. Devs plan to add even more of those, too, so keep an eye out. If you're into Dark Souls, and/or would like to kill people (or be killed) with giant swords--buy this. It's worth the money.Cons:Also must be noted that player population tends to run very low, so be patient with matches. It is a game in development, too, so, again, patience. You'll find this game is riddled with bugs and connection issues, but nothing is gamebreaking.I enjoy this game a lot; once you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun.

The only single player is a basic wave base game mode which is kind of boring unless you give yourself a challenge like ""Don't use any magic"" or something like that. Other than that the game is perfect where it is. If they pushed out one more update just fixing the bugs and doing some optimization I think more people would buy the game and I could recommend it.

76561198065695978,Recommended,248630,7812976,"Posted: 28 November, 2013",all,Outbreak,"Kingdoms Rise is a game with a great deal of potential and the FlyLeapStudios is clearly working hard at that as stated by themselves and through their first patch which has alleviated a great deal of issues that were plaguing the game. The game is clearly Early Access so you have to understand the game will eventually be something worth your time and money but it needs a bit more polish. This review is written based on playing with a rather strong computer so just bear that in mind, your experience may vary.The GoodThe good in this game is that the groundwork is clearly there for a great highly tactical chaotic sword and magic game. The art work is of a high quality and the animations are certainly well done and seamless. The gameplay is fluid for the most part and the game is functional. The combat can be quite fun as you swing, dodge, roll and use magic with relative ease to defeat your enemies. The magic spells are varied and can mix up your gameplay quite a bit. Do you want to be a stealthy guy who can assassinate someone? Do you want to be a guy who can take a lot of hits and get into the heat of battle? You have many options when deciding on the type of warrior you wish to be. The various swords in the game also have unique stats that help make your warrior be more true to your desires. Swords have stats such as increased damaged, increased back attack damage, etc and it all works quite well. Especially with the new patch that balances magic and swords out more. It is easy to be swept up into the frantic combat and I never found myself bored of it.The character creator has a decent selection of varying armor pieces for your character to wear and make him (and soon to be her) look unique to a certain extent. In the battlefield you may lose some of your identity but you can stand out depending on how creative you get. Also the team plans on adding more game modes into the game to spice up the rather lacking selection at the moment.The BadThis is an Early Access game so these problems I address could very well and probably will be gone within a month or two so take this with a grain of salt. Don’t dismiss the game because of what I say here, it is a game in progress and will evolve. The game has few modes to keep you interested right now. It’s your standard generic fps fair of Deathmatch and King of the Hill. The replay value isn’t much at the moment unless you really enjoy those.Spawn camping has been somewhat of an issue in my time with the game in so far as team modes are concerned. In free for alls I was never once spawn killed. However in team matches if one side was overpowering another it would get to the point the other team would camp the spawn and keep you locked inside of it. Without a moving spawn point this can be an issue and while you can fight your way out eventually, the spawn system shouldn’t work like that. It has been proven in countless games that fixed spawn points typically lead to spawn killing.Something about the combat doesn’t feel very meaty. It feels like I’m not really fighting so much as I am swinging a sword vaguely at the direction of pixels which pulled me out of the experience a bit. Also magic really needs some better animations, it is very easy to be blindsided by it with no warning. As I said in the last part the gameplay is still good but it needs more fine tuning to achieve all that it can.The ConclusionThe game itself again is Early Access and the gripes I mentioned I know will be stamped out a couple months time. The game does have a lot of positives going for it. The combat is smooth and the mechanics are definitely there for an excellent experience. The game is fun as it currently stands but the replay value is little at the moment. When more modes get added in and other gameplay mechanics I feel the game will have a far more powerful draw on peoples wallets. For now however the game needs more fine tuning and you can find better games with more replay value for your money. Keep an eye on patch notes and wait for some big updates before jumping in."

The game had so much potential and whilst the combat was a little rough around the edges, with a bit of polish it would have been amazing. Even with the rough edges it was an absolutely amazing battle system. However, after having owned the game at point of review for over 3.5 years with almost no support, it leaves very little hope. I've long given up that this game will get the support it requires. It quickly appeared that the developer was not actively supporting the game. They did little updates but each time there was an update not much really changed. After a year of waiting there was still no real progress although the dev was still posting on the community hub back then. They promised all these changes which never came to fruition as well.The only time this game was playable was when it first launched since it had a playerbase but from 2014 onwards the game has been dead. In 2014 you could sometimes find 1 game with a few people playing. From 2015 onwards there was literally no one. Ever.No really a long review but I guess to summarise; the game had amazing potential but with little to no support from the developer over a prolonged period it completely failed to get anywhere near its potential. A shame really.I still remember seeing this and Blade Symphony in early access and having to decide which one I wanted to get. I thought this one had the better potential so chose this instead.

Getting into a small match and enjoying duels between two players is fun enough on its own. But then you get massive matches where everything is pure chaos yet still manages to suck you right in.The controls are not intuitive - but a quick glance at the tutorials will set you right on your way. The combat is rediculously fun and easy to perform once you've grasped the basics. But oh god is it difficult to master.I've only been playing a couple of weeks and I remember my first few matches being something like 2 kills and 20 deaths, but I've been able to see myself grow in skill and I just now got out of a FFA match where I had 40 kills and 8 deaths - more than double the second place player.As if the melee combat wasn't great enough they go and throw in spells - and not a single one of them is lacking - every single spell is useful in a variety of ways and really opens up gameplay. Whether you enjoy sneaking around like a ninja, teleporting around like some multi-dimensional stalker, or blasting your enemy to pieces with a well placed fireball - there's a spell for you.Probably the most fun though is finding new tactics and new ways to counter your opponents. You'll notice pretty quickly a few loadouts that are common amongst players and I take great pleasure in being able to adapt my combat style to most effectively fight them.This game has huge potential and I can't wait to see where it goes.Feel free to friend me or shoot me a message if you want any pointers. Ill see you in game... impaled on the end of my sword that is. ;-)"

I have not tried quick joining, I have selected the servers I have wanted to join.Character CustomizationSo far in this game the Character Customization is pretty nice as far as armor and colors can go. You can change the armor on your left and right shoulders and arms independently, to mix and match some pretty menacing looking outfits. There isn’t much to choose from as of yet about 7-10 choices for each part you can customize, those parts being Head, Left shoulder, Right shoulder, Left arm, Right arm, Chest piece, Scarf (Shinobi style is my favorite), Groin, Belt, Legs, and Boots. You can even have different voices. So far as of playing I have yet to see the same two people be exactly the same (unless they were trying for it). The parts that you cannot change about your person yet are if I remember correctly Gender and Hairstyle.WeaponsThe combat in this game reminds me of Chivalry more than War of the roses, in the fact that you do not have to block in left right up down format, you just have to hold the right mouse button at the time the opponents swing would hit you and you will parry them completely. There are 5 swords to choose from so far, Stealth Sword (grants x5 backstab/flank damage) My personal favorite!!, Fire Sword (added ongoing fire damage/ may pierce block) Tank Sword( grants extra blocking time/reduces incoming damage a hair) Bowman’s Sword (extra ranged damage) and Mobility Sword (Gives you sprint speed without having to but away your sword/faster dodge rolls) Second personal favorite. Your choices for secondary weapons are as follows, An Explosive Throwing Axe (one time use 75-100 damage depending on how close the target is to it after it lands charges and explodes) Personal Favorite, A sturdy Bow (depending on the range and where you hit your target 25-100 damage multiple arrows 10 or more), a Mine ( 75-100 damage EXTREME KNOCKBACK, I have been sent flying off of capture points and into the void because of these nasty buggers), and a Trap ( a Gigantic bear trap that does either 25-50 damage and locks you in place for a few seconds, if the hunter is vigilant you are dead as soon as you trigger it)SpellsThe spells are as follows, Fireball (it’s a damage over time spell), Freeze ( Its pretty much a Trap you can use over again), Flame Drop (Execute your Target and everyone around him with this, But be warned cool down time is pretty major and you will hurt/kill friendlies), Teleport ( It’s a Teleport Spell)Choice 1 from me, Heal ( It heals you fully over time) Choice 2 from me, Phase Shift( turns you into a glowing ball that is immune to damage as long as you can hold it, really good for dodging heavy hitting swings from the fire and tank swords), Stealth ( turns you completely invisible, Be careful though your team members will not be able to tell if you are a friendly while invisible). Magic Invulnerability (Immune to all magic damage) For spells you get two choices, Teleport is a must if you want to have any kind of advantage in movement against a mobility sword!! Heal is just awesome, pop it in the middle of a fight and if you can block your opponents attacks you will be at full health in a matter of seconds.CombatHere are a few tips, if you plan on being ranged support with the bow, use the Bowman’s sword with a mine at your feet so you don’t get stealth killed. Spell choices for ranged in my opinion the best two spells are Teleport (to get to higher ground and have a height advantage against everyone on the field) and Freeze (just in case someone starts charging at you with a partner)For you stealthy people, who just love to dash in and out with maximum damage, use the Stealth sword with teleport (required) and freeze/stealth/heal.Anyone who wants to try taking on multiple melee combatants at once I suggest the Tank (hp damage reduction) or Fire sword (Pure raw damage). HEAL IS A MUST, and take fire drop just to run into a group cast it and get a good 4 or 5 kills.Learning CurveIn the beginning, you will die. It will happen. Just learn from your mistakes and have fun.Additional notesThe only three glitches I keep encountering are as follows, the in game scoreboard is glitchy at times with different resolution sizes, my name shows up as the only one typing in chat, and the other is that sometimes when I make a kill it says Player alive killed Dead Player.Much respect to the two man crew that has brought this game to life. A few things I would like to see in the future if at all possible, an Assassinate button for when you are chasing down a target that is Sprinting (sword is on their back) away from you and you have either the Stealth sword OR the Mobility sword, or just an Assassinate button in general. A capture the flag type game mode would be awesome for this game, as would dueling servers. I would like the Spell Freeze to lock people in place so they cannot turn to face me if I hit them in the back with the freeze spell. I would like the Bow and throwing axe to have better crosshairs on the screen rather than having the translucent circle that is the size of my water bottle. The last thing I have an issue with is the teleport spell I would like it to negate fall damage if timed properly, as in someone is running under a tower entrance I want to be able to jump from said tower and a few seconds before hit teleport and land safely on the ground and give chase to them, instead of just going splat on the ground. Those are my wishes :DGREAT JOB SO FAR KEEP IT UP GUYS :DFrom the Humble,Loki The Damned"

It's embarrassing to call this beta. I've played pre-alphas that have had better UI, menus, options than this.The Steam footage makes it look better than the graphics produce in real gameplay. Not that the game is ugly.. the graphics are ok. But when looking closely around the maps I see horrible low-poly grass popping out of the ground in all kinds of odd places. The whole interface lacks function and any sort of decent graphic design. There is no explanation to the weapons and spells. Nobody really knows what does what. The tutorials are only on the dev website. The sound controls do not work. The key bindings always have to be reconfigured. Only movement and special are mapped to controller so if you want to map the game with Xpadder you're screwed. Either make the gamepad fully functional or leave it off completely until it is so we can remap the keys.The list goes on. I knew I was reaching when I got this game, but ultimately I was burned. And truth be told, there is a decent game buried inside this dysfunction somewhere. The combat is actually kind of fun. But there is a long way to go until this turd blossoms. I doubt it ever will. If there is quality control on Steam how did they let this game release with a UI like that. Give this one at least another year. If it hasn't come around by then.. it likely never will."

I like it so far, but the fact that the team I just played with loved team killing so much since it was a thing, really detracted from the game. But saying that the game is bad from only that is too much. The game has a lot of interesting abilites and amazing looking weapons and armor. The customization is going to be plentiful from what I can tell. Gameplay is solid enough where you wont want to throw everything in your room that is within arms reach. The moves look strong, every blow you give looks powerful but the animations look a bit robotic and too smooth for the human body, especially when running. But those are little quips when looking at the big picture.The world looks beautiful; the lighting and the scenery. This game looks great for something that is early access and you can tell that they put a lot of time and effort into making it look that way too, without skimping out on the actual gameplay mechanics. So far I only managed to play in the forest, snow castle and uh... mini acropolis? or a hill with a light shining from the middle looking map. Look I forgot to look at the map names ok? (￣▽￣) They look great is what I am saying. This game is definitely worth the money it is asking for in my opinion, and the game can only get better later down the road.I noticed some things and if they could work on things like:Having our cooldowns on abilities reset after respawning.Being able to run and swing or at least lunge instead of sheathing your weapon and then taking the time to pull it out again.Have something that demotes team killing.This may be just me, but I feel that the controls aren't as responsive as my hands can move.Pressing escape while in game kind of jerks around and spazzes for me. It looked like it was switching from the main title menu to the In-game menu.The customization menu also had a few quirks:Having no zooming capabilities (that I know of, all I tried was the mouse wheel) to see my characters face.The slider for the Hues and Tones also turn the camera.The lighting is too bright for me to get a clear picture of the helmet. Not sure if that is just me.I didnt really see my character's hair color change. Neither did I see the eyes change for that matter.You have to wait a bit when selecting the voices unless you want your eardrums to be barraged by a chorus of yells. (It was pretty cool imaging an entire army charging when you do that though, just turn the volume down a bit)I'm really excited for the finished piece of this game and then all of the other finishing touches and polish that they are going to put on it eventually... Hopefully. If the game looks this good and is only in the Early stages and is only developed by two guys.Just saying, I'm impressed."

The trailer and screenshots showcased a fast-paced multiplayer fantasy action game. So when I saw the game appear on sale as early access, I bought it straight away and got ready for some sword-fighting action. All I have gotten so far it disappointment and frustration. The controls are awkward and unresponsive, the classes all seem to be exactly the same, several of the specials are usless (for example, there is no way to aim the throwing axes/knives), and the game itself is laggy to the point of being unplayable. I'm aware that this game is still in early access, but it would be nice if I could actually have fun with it. It is supposed to be a game, after all.I wanted to like Kingdoms Rise, I really did, but it is simply an unenjoyable experience. If you really are keen to try out this game, I would recommend waiting until it's out of early access or just avoid buying it altogether. After all, why spend fifteen USD for something this broken?"

Insta kills, unblockable attacks, parrying not working even when you are doing it correctly, and being killed while invulnerable (using phase shift) even on a decent ping. If it was worked on more and given some love, it could be a really fun PVP game. But as of its current state, the swaying of the screen to try and line up every parry and attack in quick succession, is just going to give you a headache.

The combat was decent enough for the state the game was in, if a bit confusing and frustrating at times, but that was part of the fun, learning how to do combos and then do them faster and faster.

The way they have made the game feels very real and for the most part fair. The meny different fighting styles and the fact that because this game has very few users playing so that when you enter a server you may know some people and there fighting styles makes the game seem refreashing and new everytime you enter a server. Now if only they could get everything to freaking work correctly. :P

The devs recently decided thast it was a good idea to put in throwing knives, which drastically effected the way you approach combat and overall just made the game not that much fun anymore. I know its an alpha, but its not a pretty good sign if the devs think its okay to put such an out-of-place, unbalanced weapon in the game.Regardless, its surprisingly fun for a game in its alpha.

Multiplayer/coop PVP based medieval/fantasy sword game with magic? How can something like this go wrong ... Well i didnt think it could but it did.I was very excited when i bought it, downloaded right away and jumped right into battle ... well, it took me about 30 minutes to even get into a game because either the servers were full or they wouldnt let you connect. I know that the game is still in early access and every time i buy something like this i get annoyed by things that propably will be fixed before the actual release if there is one, but , the rate of updates here is very slow, i mean slow as a turtle. With each update there is more shiny spells, more buffs, more debuffs, new shiny sword, class or whatever but the very core of the gameplay is still not fixed. Half the time when i parry perfectly i still get hit but when i attack someone from behind pretty much decapitating him the game doesnt even recognize that something like that happened and the guy walks away swings his sword about 10 meters away from me and guts me perfectly, these things after more than a year still happen.It is such a shame, because the game has incredible (and i realy mean this) potential.- The Good:Pleasing graphics, smooth and elegantSkill and combat animations.The Idea.- The Bad:Glitchy Combat ( which is 95% of the actual game)Menu feels more like an overlay, doesnt realy have the fantasy feel, generic.Lots of Bugs.Slow updatesI do realy hope that the updates will come more frequently, actualy fixing majority of the bugs so we can atleast enjoy it whilst we wait for content updates / release.Good luck."

The only thing is the game is very obviously early access, a lot of features seem to be on the way/in need of development/ in need of fixing, but despite that I recommend buying the game.Update:Game's dead, don't buy."

Honestly, with the spells being dumb and the game's playerbase nonexistant from what I remember I'm just salty that I spent so much money on this game.  Does it have the capacity to actually be a GOOD game?  Possibly but, it's a multiplayer game with no current players.  Sooooooo Yeah.  :|Edit: Should not be on steam anymore.  Not updated since god knows how long ago.Was once promising, but now I jsut wish I could get a refund.  The game is dead.  No players, no updates.

Unfotunatley, just as the others, servers died as the initial hype died. I distinctly remember Seannaers and GassyMexican playing it, and just day later a massive infulx of people. I thought that this game wouldnt get stuck in Dev hell and be tossed aside. Meh.The mechanics are clunky, feels like you are driving a tank that is shooting at a building on the other side of the planet with water baloons. The action, while some areas are paced perfectly, there is no incentive to play as a team, meaning that you will just run off on your own and go kill whoever you find which causes some people distress while others find it to be more pace ruining. I can agree with that. The magic was also clunky. Just didnt feel right. This may have been addressed in a patch some time ago, but this game fell out of relevacy almost as quickly as a my love life. Not too sure if I would recommend it, but if you are going to buy For Honor or this, go for this because For Honor is ♥♥♥♥ing trash as the devs didnt give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about it."

The combat feels unique enough, and definitely requires skill to beat your opponents. Vaugly reminiscant of Chivelry. If you don't mind the glitches that come with early access, and VERY slow updates, it's a good buy."

I would even say the abssolute best combat i ever played. It is responsive and fluid and makes dark souls pvp seem a little less exciting now than before. The magic in this games mixes up combat in such fun ways.unfortunately, no one plays this game. The servers are rarly up.The developer has not abandoned it though. It seems like he is 1 guy or a small team converting everything to a new engine. However updates on what is happening you have to go check on the facebook for this game and these updates on what is happening with this game are rare.Simply put i enjoyed this game and if the servers are actually up and you have someone to play with, this game is actually somewhat worth the price. The pvp combat is to much fun. At the very least keep your eye on it and wait for an update because I personally feel if a big studio did something like what this guy/team created or had the funds for a bigger team they would be rolling a doe."

There were a lot of players and it was just something different. Felt kind of like a mount & Blade without campaign and horses, but with magic and more weapons you could choose from.The game is all about pvp and has no actual single player, except for the ""training mode"", which i think doesnt count.Back when it had a lot of players it was pretty fun.It was, at least for me, easy to pick up but pretty hard to master. There were combos in the game but you would never find out about them because the game doesnt show you them. You would need to watch them in the internet which i found was pretty stupid.The character creation was and still is pretty good. You had a lot of options to create your own custom character and change the name every now and then if you get bored of it.Sadly this doesnt help in making the game good.When the game came out it had a dedicated player base and i was able to always find a few rooms with lots of players in it (up to 12 players on one server if i remember right, but im not sure).The lack of updates for this game resulted in players getting bored and slowly decreasing the playerbase.Barely any update for increasing the gameplay of the game was released. Just felt like the developers didnt care at all.They had to choose between making an actual good game by investing the earned money in it or just misuse the early access on steam to cash grab the players like in DayZ.Worst of all is that they are making a sequel and will most likely never finish this game. I paid 15€ for it on release.They should be ashamed to create a sequel and never make a game again for being so untrustworthy.0/5"

Not enough support, No really, like nobody cared or gave it a chance. Whiich is why i believe that sometime you just cant let gamers get beta access, because they'll play it say that it sucks or that its not good enough for modern gaming, even thought its an early access beta ( which means that it STILL in development), and just keep developing the game in silence with out gaming the gaming communityany feedback. Because gamers just judge, and 75% of them don even know nor understand programing, nor how it dificult it is,  and more when a game came from SCRATCH. so good job community at kill a woderfully made game with a great future.In end i believe that if the game is dead they should reuse the mesh and textures and the holl concept and desing  and the code and further developeit, and use it in another project, because even though the game code was a mess its still had and has potential.So please Flyleap Studios Pty. Ltd. dont give up and keep going, ther is potential in your work, beacuse i really envisioned the gaming style of KR as a good a idea for an RPG."

This games still in early release state after a long peroid of time and does not seem to be coming out with that said thats enough bad mouthing the devs cause im sure they worked hard to put something here. The game used to be fun and fast paced sword and damage dueling. Then it had problems with servers it had only 3 and they were all terrible ping and alot of lag issues but i still tryed to play it. Now its just overly complicated and no longer resembles the game i once played granted its shinyer but thats all it is at the momment a shiny dead game:/ hopefully i can raise a thumb up once they fix the combat to what people want and not what they want.
