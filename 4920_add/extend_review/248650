But it is fun to draw your stuff. The puzzles are not too challenging for somebody used to gaming, but it is a little too punishing and difficult for a kid or ultra casual audience, which I would assume to be the main market for this. Its the kind of game I'd have my girlfriend or parents play (who never play games) but I think they'd get too frustrated with it. There should be an easy mode for that. It should also autosave more than just at the start of each level. I found that if I nearly completed a level, but died at the end of it, I didn't want to bother replaying the whole level."

I have this game on my Kindle Fire HD, and I know i haven't played this much yet on the pc but I just could not resist the deal ( Which was 50% Off By The Way ) and the story of this funny game is that you need to go and save your friend who is being kidnapped by a stickman with a magical pencil that can draw anything. You also have a magical pencil too, but, you have a couple of different one's for different levels and also you get to draw anything like you can draw a cat as fire of a burger for a sword. That's not the best part of it. You get to create your own stickman your own way and also your friend and it is entertaining ( in my opinion ) for all ages. if I have to rate it out of 10, I would give it 8/10.

Considering there are free versions of the game on other platforms I am not sure why its normally valued at $5. I know five bucks is cheap, but the game really isnt worth more than a couple dollars in my opinion.Gameplay-Stickman felt like it was designed for either a younger or less experienced gamer. The Idea of drawing your own tools and items was the primary selling point for me. Unfortunatley, its actually just about 5 options the entire game- axe, key, cloud, fire, and armor. You cannot be creative and draw anything outside of that criteria.Sound-The music was fantastic and catchy. No complaints there. The main menu's music sounded oddly similar to the menu-tune from ""The Wolf Among Us"" by Telltale games.Graphics-The game delivers exactly what you would expect from a stick-figure title. however, the customization of your character was slightly dissapointing due to the bulky lines you had to doodle with. A fine-point pencil/pen would have been better in my opinion.Replay Value-The game was too short and the only challenging level was the final boss fight. I cant see myself replaying a game this quick and easy.I cant recommend this game to most customers. If you are purchasing for a younger person or new gamer it might be worth your time."

It's a silly, amusing little distraction where you make a guy and waggle him around doing stuff, setting everything on fire, accidentally blowing yourself up, and never actually killing anything. If you've got a little kid who unwisely chooses to hang around you, it's probably one of those rare games that you can both enjoy together. The devs are neat, and keep throwing stuff out there just because it's apparently fun to make.I mean, yeah, it's not Skyrim, but if you're expecting a deep, creative and complex action-RPG with a concept like this, you should probably look into that gushing head wound."

For instance, a tree blocks your path, you can then draw an axe and proceed by cutting it down (Burning it is also an option). Its cute.

This game is like a piece of candy: cheap, enjoyable, but don't expect it to last. Some levels were challenging, others not so much. The greatest pleasure in this game comes from the creative characters. Funny watching yourself get saved by your own dog, or a wierd creature trying to save a dalek. I also enjoy making very ""creative"" keys, axes, and other things. you can watch your character chop down about three targets with a stapler if you want, or make it look like an accessory while your character holds it. However, ""challenging"" puzzles weren't quite as fun since you are basically wandering around aimlessly if you can't figure out the next step. It can be painfully annoying, rather than tricky in the fun way. I think with a lot more options, both in crayon types and in world build, it might be more fun. Some (even the later levels and the Christmas one) are simple, and go by very fast. I have already beat a vast majority of the game in 8.5 hours, albeit I peaked at a few solutions after the ""challenge"" was no longer enjoyable.

,Not Recommended,248650,20775913,"Posted: 26 January, 2016",all,Snowballninja,"It's weird to see many reviews with less than 2 hours recommending this game being featured on the front page, since you need more than 2 hours to beat this game. I've played this game for more than 8 hours to get 100% achievements. I wanted to recommend this game, but I really can't.This game is based on the novel idea of drawing your own character and your own tools to progress the game. The idea is good, the artwork is decent, there is a plot, and even there are additional puzzles and Easter eggs.But, there are quite a couple flaws in either the design or implementation of this game, that makes playing this game very frustrating quite oftenly:What you draw is irrelevant in most cases -- you actually click to choose a pencil from a couple to indicate what you are trying to draw, and for most of those you can just draw a straight line for axe, key, cloud, and fire. This makes the entire ""drawing"" concept meaningless. Plus, most of the things can only be used for once or three times, so if you are trying to draw perfectly every time, it may take you a few extra hours to beat game.It's actually 3D-in-2D game, but this game deals with collision quite bad -- sometimes it looks like there is no obstacle but you just can't move.There is no pathing implemented, if you want to go to point B from point A, even if they are connected by some path, but as long as there is some obstacle lying in the connecting straight line, clicking on point B will just lead you to the obstacle -- you need to bypass it yourself.There is no saving inside a level, and if you take damage twice within a short time period, you will die and have to start over again. And it's really easy to die without even knowing why due to the two issues above, and some levels take ~10 mins to complete.There is the Paul Bunyan achievement which requires you to chop down 500 trees, but at the time I got all the other achievements , I have only chopped down 40 trees. Seeing that woodcutting isn't an important part to win this game, I think this achievement is quite obnoxious. I basically did nothing but to chop 460 trees for 40 minutes."

Человечек вышедший из графического редактора Pain, бегает по таком же рисованному миру и спасает своего товарищу(Имя так же вы ему даете).Физика не сказать что деревянная но в некоторых местах все же подводить.Музыкальное сопровождение отличное, ненавязчивое и старается поддерживать вас в расслабляющем состоянии и честно говоря это там очень нужно! Дело в том что ваш подопечный дохнет от 2 ударов, и приходиться проходить уровень заново. Причем опасность подстерегает вас не только от мобов которые стараются вас убить но и от вас самого. Вы ко всему прочему имеете некий волшебный карандаш который рисует ключ, огонь, топор, грозовые облака(Все зависит от типа уровня и задач которые нужно выполнить на нем) и тд. И стоит где то неверно нарисовать опасные вышеперечисленные предметы и вы в начале уровня. Возможно конечно, что это только моя проблема из за кривоты мои рук.Всем советую.P.S. Так же хочется отметить добавление новогоднего уровня, приятно удивил."

But this time it gets too simple.First of all, I completed this game in under 4 hours and I unlocked most secrets.Second, the game isn't worth replaying. If you played a single stage, you probably know the solution. There is only one way to complete the stage.Third, the game really didn't appeal to me. I like drawing and I expected really creative environments, monsters and completing each stage with different weapons. While I played this game I felt kinda violated. Everything was dull and uninspired.Fourth, everything was tedious. You cut trees, you fire them, you create rain clouds, keys and axes. I played this game a year ago, but I already counted almost every tool available to you. The appearance doesn't affect ANYTHING.I can't really describe this game even more. But if I had to choose three words, I would choose dull, short and boring.I bought this game on sale for about 0,50 euros. If I had to buy its actual price for about 4 euros, that would be unacceptable. Now its collecting dust in my Library."

Its actually a really fun game with a lot of replay value. In the game you have to travell through diffrent levels and in those levels you have to solve puzzles to get to the next stage. The game has diffrent types of pens that you need to use to solve puzzles Keys, Axes, Fires and Rain pens to be exact. The game also has multiple level exits so you can go a diffrent path all together. Also there are Colour buddys and Puzzle pieces to find in every level so you can find them and unlock some stuff for the game. The game has a few minor issues.

You dont have to draw something that looks like fire for it to work, a cloud can just be a line or even a dot, a axe can be a line, a key can be a line, Its easier to just make everything a damn line. Why not just call the game draw a line?The animations for your stickman are just jarring. I found it hard to move around because of this.

,Recommended,248650,8405826,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,Cactus,"A few days ago I picked up Draw a Stickman:EPIC on Steam sales. How did it turn out? Definitely it is a cute game. The locations look like they were drawn on recycled paper, which adds to the charm. The monsters and objects in the game are drawn very cute – the dragons almost seem huggable – but trust me, they’re not, same as the bees. Only the bunnies are innocent, but the for some devilish people it’s possible to hack them away with an ax or incinerate them. Many ways to kill a poor bunny!The drawing system in the game are somewhat hectic. I didn’t like it when I was drawing my stickman, the mouse cursor was pointing at one pixel and the dot was being created elsewhere… Quite hard to draw a decent-looking stickman this way, and I think even using my drawing tablet would not improve the precision as it was the pen tool itself having problems. Other complaint is that it could have been less square-ish when drawing the stickmen, some people actually wanted to make them nice, hey! In game I didn’t notice the wonkiness so much, but it also mattered far less. You don’t even have to draw a proper cloud with all the half-circles on the edge, it can be a plain oval and still will be a rain cloud. Fire could be a few strokes of pencil instead of a flame and still would work out as one.Other complaint would be the walking. When I would point the way with my mouse, mr Stickman would often end up getting stuck in something in the way, even if originally the path was clear. Towards the end of the game I found out (accidentally by laying an elbow on the keyboard) that he can be moved with WASD/the arrow keys. That one actually seems to works much nicer, as long as you can predict how mr Stickman would move – so I guess having the legs drawn properly is essential.The adventures themselves… in the intro you draw your friend and I would advise that you draw him or her properly, unless you want to spend the entire rest of your journey in the search of a gooeyling or something alike. The first few maps are very relaxing and fun. Then suddenly… This map can kill me? Ouch. Dragons like stickman lunch? Not flame retardant? Bees in my face? Ouch ouch ouch. Such a sudden transition from easy to hard is not too good, the devs should have made the difficulty climb rather than it becoming a huge jump. There is also that element of tedium when you end up being eaten right at the end of a map and have to do it all over again from the beginning. One would like to see some sort of checkpoints there instead of it being just on the beginning of the level. The puzzles themselves are mostly entertaining. Some solutions actually make you smile. Some others may make you want to pull your hair out. Controlling robots is tricky for example. Sometimes there is more than one way to solve a problem, which I found nice. The game has lots of hidden content as well – sometimes hidden too well, that you either find it by accident or some ingenious enlightenment.One thing that I discovered when I decided to listen to the game sound. Somehow I only liked the Stickopolis theme, rest sounded a bit annoying to me. Also the clicking sound of the pencils is not something that I consider nice, but that can be turned off, so not considering it as a major flaw.I would recommend picking this game up while it is on the sale, for the price it’s listed it’s worth. It’s a light game for killing the time, for people with some gaming experience it’s quite relaxing. For casuals it might come hard at some points, but if they don’t give up too easily, they could enjoy it as well.Pros: cute art, riddles, hidden content, fun storyCons: wonky drawing controls, movement issues, lack of balanced difficulty raising"
