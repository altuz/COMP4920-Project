I really did try to like it. It just feels broken. The controls feel broken, the skills are unbalanced. I only played a few hours. I just did not want to try anymore. It just wasnt worth it to me. Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, just so many more out there that are really good. This feels like a lazy port. It fooled me because the video and store page made it look so good. Im giving this review to help my steam friends stay away from it. Also it helps me to really study before I get another unknow game."

I mean, its just point and click to move around and attack things. Not much more depth to these games than that.Needless to say, I was shown exactly how you can screw it up by playing this game for 30 minutes.1. Bad controls2. Bad graphics3. No video options4. Horrible voice acting5. interface looks like its from 19936. Animations are pretty bad7. Combat is horribly slow, like its running at half the speed it should be.If this game is the project of a couple of college students trying to pass game design 101, then congrats. This game just screams amature. It feels very unpolished, and I couldnt bring myself to play it another minute, despite only having played it for 30."
,Not Recommended,248710,13550134,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,Widerstand,"Okay, first of all, I get it; This is a low budget, independent attempt to create an Action RPG exclusive for mobile devices and they've ported it to PC Platforms to widen their audience. Major kudos for people who put effort in this game, I really mean it. But, you see, when you develop a game or even any software on mobile devices, there's not much of an expectation because of the nature of mobile devices; Yet, when you port a particular piece of software that is designed to run on mobile devices, to PC Platforms, you raise the expectation bar pretty high. That's purely because a PC is much more stronger and a lot more customizable.Now, why did I buy this game? Because I had a couple of bucks to spare and it was available on Linux - which is pretty much the biggest selling point for me, as we don't have many Action RPG titles. And, sadly, we still don't have that many good titles as they have on Windows.I've read many comments and reviews about this game before buying it and I've realized that the game was in worse condition than this, as this is a PC Port. I can clearly see that they've made quite the UI Improvements, comparing to the Mobile Version of this game; Which is a good way to go but they should've made this happen at the time they were porting the game to PC. This is the main cause of the early negative user reviews and they are right, unfortunately, still the game's User Interface is pretty much useless and is still suffering from touch screen features.So, there are porting problems but what about the actual game? - If you're a Hardcore ARPG Player, you will be disappointed. The game is painfully easy and has many design flaws; Not to mention bad controls. Playing this game with a mouse as a Witch, for me, was quite painful. That's why I don't use mouse, I use my keyboard to control my character and use my abilities; and again, since it's designed for mobile devices, you have the Option to turn on or off auto-targetting. - Which is ironically the best feature this game has because it's poorly designed for a Ranged Character.Graphics aren't that bad. Not a challange, compared to other titles like Path of Exile, Grim Dawn or Diablo III. But it's okay; Not many ARPG fans do actually care about the graphics, rather than optimization of the game to allow players play the game at a higher level of smoothness and frame rates. - So far, I haven't encountered such a problem. Kudos for that.I loved the Soundtrack. OST is probably the best thing about this game and it's pretty good, you may or may not agree with me. - It gets a bit too repetitive, though. Voiceacting will seem decent to a point. But, yeah, you'll get annoyed by it anyway. And, again, it's a low-budget game, I wouldn't use this as an argument. I understand.Controls are.. well, not optimal. - As long as you bind your skills to the letters around your ""S"" key, which is the default Auto-Attack bind for the game, you're good to go. You really don't need to play this game with a mouse. Playing the game with numbers 6-9 is pointless, at least for me. - One other thing that will majorly bug people who'll choose to play this game as a Witch, when your enemy is near you; Your character will start Melee your enemy if you're using your Default Attack. Needless to say, it's weak and will most likely get you killed.There's absolutely nothing interesting about Characterization and Building up your character. It's pretty generic and quite dull. - Story, so far, is too cliche. Storytelling is weak. Dialogs are badly written and you really won't care about the Lore, when your screen is filled with Character Dialogs, talking about nonsense. - It could be developed better. But, yeah, I don't think this is their selling point anyway, since it's a freaking Action RPG for Mobile Devices.I really don't want to be harsh. But, again, when you port your game to PC, you'll raise the expectations and when those expectations could not be feed with proper features, your game will get downvoted for many many reasons.But, let me be honest, I've had good time with this game. and the ability to play an Action RPG on Linux is always a good thing for me. Yet, this game looks undone. That's why I will not Recommend this game. - Until the development provide the proper fixes to the gameplay, this isn't a game that worths its initial price. But from a discount, yeah, maybe. If you have time to spare or don't expect that much, you might entertain yourself for hours, just to beat the game and get some achievements.Iesabel might be a wasted potential. I'll never know. But I hope they learn from their mistakes and develop better games for PC. - Again, thanks for porting your game to Linux. It means a lot."

But then, for a $15 price-point, I would NOT expect a high end game (with a notable exception of Van Helsing!).  As other reviewers stated, there are lots of minor bugs and the voice acting is so flat that it is terrible.When it works, the game can be fun and there does appear to be a good story in the background.  The main problem was that there were times when a dialog box was supposed to appear and you are supposed to be shown some text from the story but when that dialog box didnot appear, the game was stuck.  You couldn't do anything except CRTL-ALT-DEL to quit the game.

,Not Recommended,248710,8723457,"Posted: 15 January, 2014",all,Harmian,"I've tried to like this game but it simply has flaws. tons of them.What exactly is lesabel?An action-rpg like diablo or torchlight.What are the major flaws?Starting with the lack of mouse-over-information on many icons, over a missing stats screen (I can't even see the benefits of skilling dexterity since there aren't any stats like dmg/s, accuracy, block%, etc.), horrible voice acting (barbarian sound like a thirteen old trying to make his voice darker), flaws in questdesign (many quests aren't even listed - f.e. witch in swamps who needs ingredients - ingredients weren't listed there. gave her something random. she was ♥♥♥♥♥ing around. quest failed. wtf?), tons of clipping issues (prepare to get stuck (had to restart) between fences or to bump in everything), a pretty lame combat system with no autoattack and a confusing healthbar where you can't tell if you have 100% or 80% health and there are only 2 classes - barbarian and witch.What are the minor flaws?The menues overall seem to be unfinished - icons look pretty bad. There are only few color indicators for equipment, like a missing red color for gear you can't equip. The german translation is googletranslate + hasn't been translated at all - very bad job, really - if you can't get this done well stick to english but don't give us a sh*tty translation.Well, and the graphics itself are ok, nothing more. Flora looks nice, enemies and main character have good animations. Some NPCs look like ps1-era, nevertheless.What did I like?The music and style overall. It's like a dark diablo with ambient music. Even though I haven't tried alchemy and other crafting skills due the lack of information overall there are many different ingredients like berries and enemy drops to collect for potions, scrolls and other things.Overall:I can't recommend this game after playing it for almost 2 hours. The flaws were killing my motivation within the played time to bottom zero.Disclaimer: I've played diablo 2 for more than 1.000 hours. Titan Quest almost 200 hours. Torchlight 1 100% achievements. I know and like the genre but this game - sorry, no."

I could imagine playing this on the bus on the way to work... but as a fully-fledged PC gaming experience, it falls significantly short of the competition.- $15 USD may be asking too much, when there are similar experiences of higher overall quality for a lower price out there.- The basic combat is unresponsive, which too often results in awkward, unenjoyable experiences. Combat being the bread & butter of the game, this quickly becomes tiresome.- Character designs are often poor, or just bland, and the quality of their models match this.- The animation is APPAULINGLY amatuer. This makes the game incredibly dull, rendering the world's inhabitants devoid of any personality or energy.- The sound assets are a joke, and have that overall ""canned"" feeling: terrible voice acting and sloppy effects.- On the UX (experience) side of the UI, there's a lot of work that could be done. Navigating the game's interface often feels unintuitive.- Very few in-game graphics options, with the absence of features like AA being particularly noticeable."

But I'm having a lot of fun with Iesabel, and that's all I'm asking from a game.  This is a fun dungeon crawler in the vein of Diablo III or Titan Quest.  Indeed, it has a rough translation and some fairly awkward menus to grind through, especially when managing resolutions.  Plus only two characters for use is kinda a step back, even compared to Diablo 1.But I'm giving this game some leeway, due to the fact it started out as an iPad/iPhone mobile game.  On those devices, this game is a freaking dynamo; it's easily one of the most deep 'hardcore' games on mobile devices.  When ported to the PC, it faces much more competition, especially as deeper and higher budget.  But I think that this game holds up well.Whether you can forgive this game's roots and see it for what it is - that's for you to decide.  For the price (I paid twelve bucks for it) I say go for it.  It's surprisingly in-depth and really feels at home on a PC.  Totally worth the price.  Thumbs up."

This game is what you call PURE EVIL. When you love action RPGs like Titan Quest or Diablo, you go and make something like Path of Exile or Grim Dawn. But when you see those games getting support and want some too while doing especially nothing, you make Iesabel. This game is not just bad. It's one of the worst I played, and from my profile you can see I play a lot. I also had PS1 back there and PS4 now, plus Wii U and 3DS. I never seen such a catastrophy of a game.The worst thing in Iesabel is the controls - and I can't explain it, it just feels broken. Your character moves whenever he or she wants, and you cant realize, what's blocking your path, because ground texture is like... I dont want to use the s-word here, but this is perfect analogy.

Когда кто-то пытается лениво склонировать Диабло и постричь денег на популярном некогда и переживающем второе рождение благодаря играм вроде Grim Dawn и Path of Exile жанре, получается нечто плохое. Но Иезабель - это не просто нечто плохое, это НАТУРАЛЬНОЕ ЗЛО.Играть в эту игру просто нереально. Управление уничтожает любые попытки получить хоть какое-то удовольствие. Ваш персонаж движется как марионетка на веревочке, а уж какп рименять скиллы... Это даже не буду комментировать - это надо самому прочувствовать, НО НЕ СТОИТ. Более того, скиллы ужасны и несбалансированы, а количество персонажей то ли пока, то ли до определенного момента в игре равно ДВУМ, что не дает даже надежды на разнообразие.

It feels so much like Diablo 2, I can't even begin to describe the similarities, it might as well be Diablo 2.If you need a style of game like this, for your tablet, then I suppose, buy it, but as far as PC gaming, Torchlight II, or Path of Exile, and I personally didn't even like Path of Exile, but I'm going to tell you, that game, is better then this one, in game play, resolution, story, depth of characters, every sense of the word.Iesabel gives you the choice of one of two characters, Barbarian or Witch.  Really Witch should just be Necromancer and be done with it, but yeah it's a Witch.  Barbarian is Male, Witch is Female, there is no choice to switch or swap.  There is no character customization of any kind, I imagine finding loot changes your appearance, but I didn't get far enough in the game to find any loot.Basically it's an IOS Game, if you're buying games on your PC, there are many games that do it bigger or better, get one of them.

The tab icons (character, skills etc) show no info while hovering over, so you have to try until you find the right tab. Items can disappear, e.g when you try to equip a staff when you wield a totem and a shield. The character reacts inaccuratly to mouse clicks. If you use the auto targeting mode you have a hard time targeting the enemy you want. If you don't use it, you habe a hard time hitting at all. Projectiles are fired in the direction the character is looking after a short delay instead of the direction the mouse pointer. That means either you stand still until you have fired or the projectile will fly in a random direction. But even if you wait, it can go wrong, when the mouse pointer is above some unpassable terrain, which is hard to distinguish.All these things slow gameplay down, which isn't fun.The graphics are not good, but OK.In my opinion the game is in a pre-beta state and needs a lot of fixes.

I tried really, really hard, but I just couldn't.the skills are horribly thought out, or simply not thought out whatsoever. some skills are so weak compared to others that they lose all value, and crafting skills come at the expense of combat skills. levelling skills beyond their bare minimum also seems to lower the value of those skills, given that the mana cost for the skill increase is much lower than the benefit of levelling the skill. overall, the entire skill system seems as though it was simply thrown in at the last minute, or that it was half completed when the game was considered complete, and so they added a bunch of filler to make it at least seem like there is a worthwhile skill system in it.gameplay is also horribly broken. if you're playing as the ranged class, it isn't as broken, but it is still broken. horribly broken. the game feels both unresponsive, and poorly designed in the gameplay aspect, especially targetting, in which the player always seems to target the 'closest' mob, regardless of which mob you are clicking on, unless 'manual targetting' or whatever is enabled. manual targetting doesn't completely fix the problem, but it does alleviate it a tiny bit, so that it is (very) slightly more playable.the item system is also terrible. it, like the skills system, seems as though it was simply thrown in at the last minute, or half completed and thrown in anyway, with some filler included. at least this, however, comes with some explanation, if you find the pane which describe the benefits of the stats. this, much like everything else in the game comes with almost no hint of where to find it, or its' usefulness.the levels are mediocre, with very basic enemies, and the poor player responsiveness, as well as the terrible targetting system makes the game so trying, that you end up resenting the time you spent trying to like the game."

At that price point, I would recommend the game to anyone who likes the genre.Probably the most positive thing I can say about the game is that the graphics engine is actually pretty good.  I'd give it a 7.5/10 and rank it just a notch below Path of Exile when comparing it to recent ARPG titles.  The art style is sort of in between D3 and PoE, with a more gritty, realistic direction than what D3 had.  Environmental animations are done well.  Character and NPC animations not as well, but adequate.The music/ambient sound is not bad, and is varied enough throughout the game that you probably won't end up having to mute it--UNLESS--you're playing the barbarian with the horrible voice.  Seriously, it's like Bale's Batman voice was trying out for a death metal band's lead vocalist opening.The controls are so-so.  You can tell the game was ported from a touch title.  Sometimes you think you're clicking on something (and most likely are) but the game doesn't want to acknowledge the action.  Fortunately for combat you can assign a key to your standard attack so it didn't hamper this aspect of the game much.  It was most noticable when trying to pick up loot and you had to click around 10 times before it would finally pick up.  This didn't happen often enough for it to become a throw-the-monitor-out-the-window type of nuisance.The stat engine, very important in any ARPG, is pretty generic and simplistic.  Unfortunately, the loot is very generic with no named items or outstanding qualities to be found throughout the game.  You get unique, epic and legendary items that just have those classifications tacked on before the item name and some pretty generic stat modifiers depending on which classification it is.The difficulty level (on default/easy) has some weird swings early on but the game does become quite easy toward the end if you've spent your skill points wisely.  The skill system itself wasn't horrible as a barbarian, just a little simpler than say D2.Probably the biggest flaw in the game is the English translation.  It's awful.  I can only imagine they hired Kanye West to do it.Finally, there are a lot of bugs.  Nothing that kept me from finishing the game, however the final boss fight did partially freeze up on me the first time I attempted it and I had to kill the game process.  The second time through worked out ok.   In the third act there are graphics placeholders for conversations with some of the NPCs; there are quests in every act that don't work correctly; there are achievements that are unattainable with the game in it's current state.  Apparantly multiplayer doesn't work after the latest patch (Dec 13) and the developers seem to have disappeared.So, to summaraize, I'd give the game somewhere around a 5/10 at the moment and I can't recommend it at it's current (14.99) price point, or at any price point if no working multiplayer is a deal breaker for you.  Otherwise for a single player ARPG it's probably worth checking out at $5.00 or less."

I still gave it a yes to encourage future indie gaming as i'm fed of the 3 hours long SPs and MP focused AAA boreness nowadays.

Some friendly like stuck mobs waiting to be killed, funny bugs like floating trees or trees without trunk or nasty bugs like invincible enemies buging you through a level (fortunately it only happens on a few levels and only if you stay too long on it). The game excels in visuals and sound/music. Some levels are just beautiful like the Glacier or Gardens. The music is nice Diablo (1) like throughout the game, but some may find it annoying. The sound effects sometimes are very good except the barbarian voice that is annoying/scary/funny, sounds like he needs some serious talk with a psychiatrist and absolutely do not fit with his apperance.In overall it seems the devs took some time into the game but they had not enough resources.If you give it a try choose the witch, her basic magic 'gun' don't eat mana and forget alchemy skill route as that is a total mess . BTW this girl can be nudified ingame. Maybe the devs fear someone mod their game (who? why?) with a nude patch so they included it. I have never seen such offense in other offical games.

Should it cost money?  No.  Why?  Because the game is so full of bugs that I would honestly consider this a Beta and NOT a full release.  Until they are fixed this should be free.  Some of the bugs: the game minimizes to desktop regularly; the player will get stuck in terrain; some monsters glitch causing them to not able to be hit but are still able to do damage to you; the game does crash though rarely...etc...Gameplay...  I understand that the developers' primary language isn't English.  I can accept this.  But I cannot accept a translation that leads to very juvenile, confusing and idiotic dialogues.  Most of the time I felt like the NPCs and even my character were 3 years old.  It was completely annoying and made the game's plotline difficult to follow.  Near the end of the game I just didn't care anymore and clicked my way through all the conversations.  Also, the lack of proper translation leads to Axes and Mauls being labelled as ""2 handed swords"" and etc...  Basically, most weapons are labelled as a ""sword"".The fighting...  The game missed the mark on this.  One would think that you could click on the enemy and be able to kill them.  But this isn't always the case as lootable items laying on the ground will interfere with your targeting.  Sooner or later you will just click on the Sword button in the action toolbar to attack and stop clicking on enemies to attack.  I only played as the male fighter but I noticed that if I only used my sword attack I didn't receive much damage.  As soon as I tried any of the special skills I immediately recieved a large amount of damage.  This made it so that I completely stopped using or caring about any of the special skills as the use of them would severely damage or kill me.Let me wrap this up...  The game in this current state is playable and at times very enjoyable.  But because of the many shortcomings I can not recommend paying for this game.

Iesabel looked interesting, but fell far short of the value, even as a casual diversion.The English translation (at least) is poor, but it's readable and can be understood, so that's not so bad; and, at least the voice acting is enjoyably awful. I giggled like a child every time my witch leveled up and cheerfully proclaimed, ""I am getting skilled!"" However, when paired with the buggy combat and clunky controls that don't always work right, it all became a real downer. The whole experience feels unfinished and poorly-programmed, as if a lot of time and resources were spent developing graphics and the actual gameplay was thrown in as an afterthought. Unfortunately, in a Diablo-clone, that really defeats the purpose.The aiming is terrible, even with auto-aim turned on. Every other time I tried to attack an enemy, my character would shoot in whatever direction she happened to be facing at the time, without turning. The skills are poorly detailed and mysterious; you can really only figure out what some of them do by putting points into them and attempting to use them. Maybe most frustrating of all, there's very little in the way of help or information available; tutorial pop-ups can be turned on for new characters, but all the features that gamers have come to recognize as standard and even fundamental in this type of game, nowadays, are absent: No windows appear when you hover over anything (you have to left-click to bring up a separate, static window), descriptions are vague or nonexistent, and when played at fullscreen resolutions, the text can be eye-watering to try and read.The clincher for me, though, was the story. I admit a certain bias: The device used at the very beginning is one of my pet peeves, but that's because it's bad writing. Like, Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits bad: You're apparently one of several heroes summoned by the ""Shaman"" who is the head of the Council of Wizardry. He has seen a great darkness threatening to destroy blah blah blah. All humanity blah exposition blah evil blah proper noun blah tragedy blah destiny blah blah and for some reason these mighty heroes and champions are riding in a cart and literally no one is driving, the horse is just going where it wants.Then these demons or whatever attack and kill everyone but you. You go the Shaman, who's nearby. He wears a fur shawl and lives in the tiniest hut.The tiniest.It is a filthy, dirty, tiny yurt.And when you tell him what happened, he says you must prove your innocence because he can't know who actually killed the other ""heroes"" or you'll be put to death as a traitor in 5 days. ""By the laws of our people...""When you say ""How dare you call me a liar,"" this dirty, mean, weird man proclaims that he is THE HEAD OF THE COUNCIL OF WIZARDRY AND HE WILL END YOUR MISERABLE LIFE.""BUT YOU BROUGHT ME HERE. YOU SUMMONED ME. YOU KNEW I WAS A DESTINED HERO. YOU HAD A VISION. WHY WOULD I LIE, THERE WERE DEMONS. I'M STILL COVERED IN THEIR BLOOD.""""Nope. Go to town and do sidequests or I, in my dirty yurt - my durt - will kill you, even though you are a foreigner who is only here because of me and even though you were attacked by the demons from my vision who I summoned you to battle against, fifty yards from where I sleep as head of the Council of Wizardry.""So I lost interest. :|"

The game was only $1.43 so I can't complain about the seemingly robust solo campaign. However, I bought this game with the expressed intention to play it with a buddy. Advertising this game as a multiplayer experience and then not offering one is some bad juju. :*(  Cannot recommend this if you are looking for a place to spend time dungeon crawling with friends. You can however sit like a king on a throne of riches, surrounded by NPCs."

Unfortunatly I don't know if it's fun because the multiplayer does not work as of 20 May 2013. If they fix that it might be quite good, but if you are looking to buy this game for a fun multiplayer ARPG, don't."

Voice acting for the barbarian is someone attempting to talk with a deep voice that isn't very good, but tried to cover it up with voice editing. The gameplay is pretty bad. 2 classes, gender locked, only one skill tree is different between them. No real ""skills"" to speak of. Pathing is terrible. If you are looking for a good Hack'N Slash do not play this one.Graphics - 4/5 - Looks can be deceiving.Gameplay - 1/5 - Boring repetitive nightmare, terrible menus, uninformative tooltips.Sound - 1/5 - One of the worst sound tracks and terrible skill sounds.Voice acting - 0/5 - I do not know why they even put it in.Story - 0/5 - Over used scenario, and most off the wall bipolar npcs.Replay Value - 0/5 - They should have to pay people to play this game.Other than achievements, do not waste your time here."

It had some potential, but mechanics and some other stuff make it unplayable nowadays.The only BIG plus is music. I particulary fell in love with the song from the second location the player is put in. Acoustic guitar and vocals - some epic ambient.If you find this game in some bundle or for little to no money - try it as a curiosity."
