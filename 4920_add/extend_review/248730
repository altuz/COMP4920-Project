The soundtracks are amazing and very well fitting. It makes you think deeply how to tackle certain situations in the fastest way. Usually while playing games I zone out and think about other things while I play it. However A Walk in the Dark had my full on attention the entire time. I am very glad I bought it.Running around as a cat is the best. 10/10"

The music and art direction are phenomenal, and create a unique atmosphere that few games can achieve; but the game itself was just not well developed. I love challenging platformers, but the engine and physics of this game were programmed to screw you over. I'd estimate a whopping 90% of all deaths are the fault of the game, not the player. And that's being lenient.Sometimes the levels can be really fun, but often they're just not. Not unfun in a challenging sort of way. Unfun in an I-can't-control-my-fricking-character sort of way way. The only thing that really keeps me playing is the amazing visuals and music. It confuses me as to how some parts of a game's design (music and graphics) can be so top-notch, and other parts (such as engine and physics) can be disastrous. I mean, the game's not broken because of glitches (I barely encountered any); the game's broken because it wasprogrammedthat way."

,Recommended,248730,8147159,"Posted: 20 December, 2013",all,Marooned Mart,"Number one vote for one of the most precise and beautiful games I have ever played. A Walk in the Dark is an amalgam of puzzle, platformer and speedrun, rolled into a gorgeously crafted game. In A Walk in the Dark you play 2 roles, a girl who is enamoured by her cat, and a cat that's enamoured by said girl. The storyline is pretty brief, the girl and cat are separated, and the two partake in finding each other. It's actually kinda heart wrenching to me personally as a lover of animals and the bond between what could ultimately be your best friend is understood by both the game and the player, it shows, and it's executed very well.So let's talk about the meat of the game. I do prefer the cat levels so we'll start with them, there are two modes of play for the cat, platforming and speedrunning. Speedrunning has you on an auto-scroll chase to the end of the level, whilst avoiding obstacles by jumping from floor to ceiling, almost like flipping the gravity, similar to the popular indie game VVVVVV. The platforming levels will have you navigating some perfectly designed levels with the tightest controls you will ever use. The cat can control his jump height, his speed and can wallkick.The girls levels are platform based, and the mechanics involved are very very similar to VVVVVV, albeit with a bit more inertia to make things difficult. The girls levels have sort of a floaty charm to it, separating it from VVVVVV.The hook here for me is the wonderful aesthetics. The art style is so good, almost boasting a Limbo-esque feel with some wonderfully scrolling backgrounds, coupled with an ambient vibe soundtrack with lashings of deep piano. A Walk in the Dark is not easy, I think I actually now hate cats, and girls that float. The engine is so well designed and so precise it will have you on your knees, begging for something easier.I jumped into A Walk in the Dark expecting some kind of cinematic platformer, as the inspirations from Limbo are apparent, at least graphically. What I got was a well designed, precise and gorgeous little platformer/puzzle game that has taken the very best from games like Limbo and VVVVVV, turned into something a bit more thought provoking. A game for fans of the genre, a game for anyone who likes being dominated by difficulty, cat-lovers and indie gamers alike. A Walk in the Dark is awesome and brilliant, one of the best indie games I've played. Very much recommended."

Even to the point that you just want to keep on playing it.You find yourself faceplanting youself into spiky walls and other obstacles and finally nailing a level after 357 tries is absolutely rewarding.Only thing that really bothers me, is the fact that the controls are really wonky and ""the agile cat"" doesn't have any air control whatsoever.9.5/10 , go buy it and get frustrated."
,Recommended,248730,14734359,"Posted: 4 March, 2015",all,Twistor,"In this challenging platformer you get to be a cat named Bast. Your best friend (owner?), a girl, is whisked away by a creature akin to grim reaper and you have find her. To do this you have to run, jump and crawl through 100 levels of increasing difficulty, all with high contrast graphics similar to Limbo.There are actually three different kinds of levels. In all of them you have to reach the light at the end of the obstacle course of a level. Cat levels are the most numerous of the bunch. They are the basic platforming levels where you, the cat, can run, jump and wall-jump through the dungeons filled with lethal spikes, playful porcupines, levitating spike balls and moving saw blades and spear traps. Later on there are crumbling, disappearing and reappearing, occasionally sharp-edged platforms to watch out for and also happy swinging giant spiders and cannons with both regular and homing bullets to dodge. Spiky death is pretty much guaranteed.Second kinds of levels are the girl levels. Girl is trapped in a spirit world, filled with (surprise!) spikes and saw blades and other lethal things I already mentioned. However, for an unknown reason she can jump to the ceiling and back at will. This being the only thing she can do the game pumps a lot of levels out of the simple movement mechanics and both stationary and moving traps.The third and the most frustrating level type (for me) are the cave levels. In these the cat moves with the same jump-up-and-down mechanics as the girl but running constantly. Precision jumps are easy enough in the early levels but later on they have to be made within a tiny fraction of a second, quickly accumulating tiring deaths. Sometimes you also have to crawl under deathly spikes, bullets or those sneaky, swigging spiders. Frankly, I disliked the cave levels a lot because the speed makes the imperfect hitboxes significant. Also, why must Bast suddenly run when s/he was fine with careful jumps before? Fortunately, there are only some 20 cave levels, so they are in the minority.Most levels are quite short, lasting just some 10-20 seconds. You get an achievement for par-timing all levels, which is fairly difficult but gets easier as you learn to control both characters. There's also a shiny collectable in each level. Cave running levels don't have par-times, instead requiring you to beat them on the first go. That sounds evil but it's a bluff because you can just try the level again from the level selection screen after each failure to try again.After beating the game there are ten more challenge (cat platforming) levels to beat that are even more difficult than the story levels. Fortunately they are not required for the acquirement of the ultimate achievement: Ninja Cat. To get that you have to beat the game without dying more than 10 times. It's a very difficult and frustrating achievement despite that you can beat the game in around half an hour.Unfortunately, the last few of the cave running levels have speed sections that lag the game to a halt, making it jerky with a framerate less than 10. This makes those very precision-heavy levels virtually unplayable. I know this is a problem with my system but I have tried the game on three different computers, a laptop and two desktops, all of which have this same problem (and AMD Radeon type cards that are probably to blame). It makes the Ninja Cat tries a true pain. For some reason the levels work alright when I first start the game but not if I play through all the levels.All in all, A Walk in the Dark is a very challenging platformer. Granted, sometimes the deaths become really annoying as the hitboxes don't exactly match the graphics, but it's worth its present price (6 €) and can often be grabbed for half that on a sale."

The level designs are clever and interesting, with what should be a steady difficulty curve, but movement--particularly jumping--feels drunken and ungainly.* The forward momentum of a typical jump is about equivalent to Shovel Knight's forward momentum when he's jumping in the direction of a strong wind*Hitboxes extend out so far, you can die by jumping straight up when there are spikes on a platform to the side of you.*The wall jump tends to be more of a wall headbutt, followed by an immediate fall onto spikes.Every level plays like the aerial equivalent of an ice level, and that's simply unworkable for what's clearly supposed to be a twitch platformer requiring precise control.On the rare occasions this game works, it works beautifully. I don't think I've ever seen a game cry out this hard for a tool-assisted speedrun. But if you simply want a fun, challenging platformer, play . . . well, any of the games it rips off besides Limbo."

The music is beautiful, the gameplay is amazing and you get to be a cat! :D This is a game that will get your face red from failing so many times but you still want to play the level again. This game is almost like mario and you have to get to the other side without running into spikes, porquipines <---I spelled that wrong and chainsaws, yes chainsaws. The story of this game is your owner gets taken away by a shadowy creature and you (the cat) is going after her to find and save her. But when you die or run into spiky things the cat disperses like smoke, it's actually really cool. Now for the bad, as much as I love it there are a few things that I would like to say I would like to see improvements on. The cats jumping is horrible, yes its like a cat but when you have to jump from wall to wall like in ""Remember Me"" it's very frustrating when the cat jumps off course and runs into a wall spike or you get it just right to fall onto a spike.

It adds alot more. For starters theres music- something limbo was really lacking. also you can play as two different characters a cat and a little girl. As you start you'll feel a bit rubbish dying alot. but once you get the hang of its a breeze... atleast for the first few maps. with 100 levels and it gets harder as you go. I was stuck on some 'medium' difficulty maps for 7+ minutes. if it wasnt for the difficulty im afraid this would be a rather short game. 9/10 thus far."

The levels with the cat started off easy and fun as expected, I played about 5 levels as the cat and all was well. And then it continued, and the next 3 or 4 levels were playing as the girl, I thought ""Ok that wasn't as fun, but I'm sure I will play as her again soon and it'll be better"". I continued to play the levles one by one and it wasn't long that the gameplay just started to become kinda dull and drawn out. I am a fan of platformers such as Super Meat Boy and Bloody Trapland, but A Walk in the Dark failed in comparison. The level designs were not all that great and actually took too long to actually become any form of challenge, and as a result began to lose my interest the more and more I played.But I kept playing, and I started noticing something, ""What the ♥♥♥♥ happened to the little girl?"" It was a 16 level stretch of playing as nothing but the cat and took up until level 26 to get play as her again, and that was for a brief for 3 levels. And this pattern continued to follow suit throughout the whole game. Now its not so much that I am complaining about the lack of girl sequences, because I'm not, these girl sequences weren't all that fun and did nothing but break up the game, I'm just wondering why they were in the game at all, its like the developers just threw their hands up in the air and said ""We got nothing for her as far as gameplay, so lets just stick mostly to the cat and keep little bits of the girl in there for the sake of story!"" But really the sequences with the girl need to be improved, expanded on, and deversified like the cats sequences are or else they just need to be taken out entirely.As far as story goes, there isn't one. Yes the beginning cutscene shows death seperating the girl and cat, but this is never brushed up on again. The idea of the story is the only thing fueling the desire for progression, other than pure completionism.However, I will say that this game has a great soundtrack and it one of the better ones I've heard in recent memory. Its not like Dustforce in the sense that its great to do homework or whatever to, but its pretty and solemn, making it a good soundtrack to fall asleep to."

This is such a pain when you need to do precise moves or jumps,and especially wall-jumps, or steering in mid-air- edges of platforms are buggy, and you will sometimes freeze for no reason, or being unable to jump- due to the very bright background, you often can't see well things that are white and shining (such as trinkets or gravity reversers). This holds true for the whole game.- timings of saws/platforms makes them often in the way of your progression, and you need to stop (and loose your speed, of course), this kills the pleasure of a fast run/fast death/fast respawnFor the girl (VVVVVV like) :- still the same problem with inertia, but as you don't need to jump, it's not as painfulThis is by far the most playable mode.For the runner like :- whenever you lag, you're dead (and to me it happened a lot of times at any time, maybe because of my comp)- a STUPID achievement requires to win each of these levels in the ""first run"", meaning that if you want to finish the levels at 100%, then whenever you die, it's ESC -> go back to map -> reload the level (restart won't give you the ""first run""), which is a dumb concept for a fast respawn runner.It's not really what I would call a bad game, but due to the several points I mentioned, it kills fun. All that remains is frustration, piling up in all the levels, and the will to finish at 100% this addictive game (when you respawn, the game automatically begins, so you hardly have a second to breath or to get out of it), and all of this for what ? to see that you will NEVER finish it at 100 % when you witness the last challenge level (I've tackled it for half an hour and I always die after the first seconds, and the levels are awfully long).Well, this review is certainly quite long too, so I will end it here :This is NOT a new SMB and NOT a new VVVVVV, because I don't want to compare a jewel to a rock"

I really like the art style.+ Music is okayBut it all fails at one really important thing. The control. There's a delay between pressing a button and the reaction in the game. I found out at a later point, that you can reduce the delay by playing in window mode but that might just apply to myself.I guess the developers knew they ♥♥♥♥ed up the controls, because one of their achievements is to die 10k times. Which you will probably obtain at the middle of the game.The game itself reminds me of a mixture between Limbo (art style), Super Meat Boy (difficulty) and VVVVVV (gravity changes), which is nice but the level design starts to get okay to good after the first third of the game, which is sad.There are 3 gameplay types basicly.Normal platforming (reminds me most of super meat boy)The girl: platformer like VVVVVV (really frustrating with a delay up to 0.5 seconds for me)The cave: scrolling levels with VVVVVV change gravity aspect (really really frustrating, because some levels require pixel perfect ""jumps"" almost, and I really recommend not trying to achieve the ""first try"" badges.Each level requires for 100%ing that you beat the time and collect a shiny object in every level (except the cave once, where there is no time to beat but ""first try"" it). You don't need to do both extra objectives at the same time.You also don't need to play the levels in order, you can skip some if you can't beat them.For collecting 10 shiny objects you unlock a challenge level. If you got used to the controls they are really nice actually.This game is a nightmare for all completionists. In order to 100% the game you need to pass all cave levels without dying once. That is really frustrating, because if you do you need to shut off the game and then restart it and then try it again once. That delay I wrote about makes this impossible for me.There are also some weird aspects ... for example: The ""cutscenes"" in this game are weird. They are mostly like 1 second long and do nothing to present a story or whatever and the main menu looks really bad compared to the actual gameplay.All in all I really want to like this game but the controls give me the feeling that most mistakes where not made by me but the game, which is something you don't experience in Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV."

There is absolutely no room for error, which can be fine, but the levels are lacking checkpoints. I've been stuck on the same level for several years, just periodically giving it another try. When I stop playing, it's not because the challenge feels too impossible; it's because the lack of checkpoints has me completing and re-completing the first section of the level over and over again until I'm just sick of doing it."

It's good for a few hours of entertainment, and is recommended for its art style, including music, and enjoyable gameplay. On the downside it's too short and doesn't offer enough challenge to play for very long.You usually control a black cat, named Bast, and less often the cat's owner, a little girl named Arielle, through 100 short but fairly tricky levels. There is no story to speak of - it appears that the cat and girl are separated and are trying to get back to each other, which is all the motive they really need. Your goals are to (1) not die as you make your way to the end of each level, (2) optionally complete the levels within a ""par"" time, collect a difficult-to-reach ""shiney"" in each level, and beat a few auto-scrolling levels without dying on your first attempt.Without a plot, you might entertain yourself by identifying all the gaming elements that AWITD has borrowed (ahem, stolen) from other games. This is true both of its art direction and gameplay, although the game adds just enough of its own personality to make it feel like more than a knock-off.Starting with the game art, the most obvious influence is Limbo, as the characters and landscape slide by in silhouette. But where Limbo was dark and violent, this game always stays light and fairy-taley, with your character's many deaths rendered with a rather artful puff of black smoke. The backgrounds come from any number of recent indie platformers, with bright contrasts and light blooms and generic ""world"" colorings. The game's music - tinkly piano - is unusually good, although after awhile the repeating themes start to wear thin.If you've played Super Meat Boy, you'll instantly understand how most of the cat levels work: precise jumping, up to and including sticky wall sliding and avoiding spikes and spinning blades. If you've played any of the million games that incorporate an inversion mechanic, you'll recognize the girl's (only) trick, a gravity flip. If you played VVVVVV, you'll recognize similar tricky flipping challenges in later cat levels. If you played Bit.Trip Runner, you'll recognize the auto-scrolling levels. Unfortunately the game is too easy and too short to really stand up to any of these others - only the later levels were really interesting or challenging, and the game could have been more satisfying if it had more thoroughly explored its own interesting mechanics.Overall this is an enjoyable, but light, little game."

A ""damsel-in-distress"" outline: Girl is kidnapped by evil thing, cat trying to rescue her. I think the introduction cinematic giving you this outline is basically identical to Super Meat Boy (and that in turn is probably imitating Super Mario Bros)- The gameplay follows in the wake of Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV: Run through the levels as quickly as possible and evade obstacles by jumping, wallrunning and switching the direction of gravity (walk the ground and ceiling). It's mostly about having quick reactions and understanding when to jump and how far to move the cat in either direction.- Art looked good at first, but it's becoming repetitive quickly. You see the same backgrounds over and over just with different color sets. The settings sometimes switch, but there are only like 4-5 and they switch back and forth. The music isn't too bad and may have a few recognizeable tunes, but I haven't come to notice more than 3 or 4 tracks that ripple around a bit meaningless (bad mouths may say it's dull, simply).- Even if the story, art and music were better: You wouldn't come to appreciate it too much. The later stages in this game become so difficult your thoughts will mostly circle around coordinating your jumps and moves pixel by pixel, and hitting your keys to the nearest millisecond for there is almost no room for error later on.If you are looking for story, art and music that keep you drawn to the end don't buy it. If you are looking for a platforming game that refuses to hold your hands and that punishes every mistake you make you'll enjoy and at times probably curse this, as seems normal with these kinds of games."

As the game goes on, the levels get harder and you're supposed to use your experience from earlier levels to clear the later ones.This is made impossible by the controls of this game, which might be the wonkiest I've ever seen in any game. It's extremly hard to be precise when playing through this game and yet, the game requires extreme precision to get the shinies, clear the challenges or, heck, even clear the normal stages! If you create a game and want to creat challenging platforming you create difficult levels and use intricate level design, not controls that work against the player.And this is why the music is annoying, even if it's good - listening to the same music over, and over, and over again as you try to battle against the controls make it so you'll lose any good memories with that music, thus not liking it.I really want to recommend this game due to it's visual style, but I can't because this games fails so greatly at what makes a platformer a platformer."

It was ok that the first enemies I encountered had the same logic as the enemies in a game a friend coded in a week.  I was a little disenchanted with it by the time it tossed me over to the first level with the girl.The levels with the girl are just not fun for me at all.  It's not because they're difficult that they are not fun; it's because they are not difficult in an interesting way.  It's just - well, here are your mechanics and here are your levels, and if you want to try getting around in any but one way, too bad, even though the movement and environment are not nearly as fun as those of the cat, so accomplishing that getting around in that one way is just not something I want to spend my time doing.So, although I was hopeful for it and maybe if I play it in the future while watching something interesting on another monitor, I can get to some of the more interesting cat levels - I don't anticipate my opinion of it going way up and I cannot recommend it to anyone."

(The similarities between the games are very, very slight, however--essentially limited to 'generally dark shadowy art style.') Where the game shines is in the controls: playing as the cat feels just as graceful as you might hope. Simply jumping around is fun--the same sort of feeling you'd expect only from a super mario game, where the fluidity of the jumping mechanics makes idling around the mushroom kingdom/delfino plaza highly satisfying. The cat's levels feel less like VVVVV and Super Meat Boy and more like The Impossible Game, if it were granted free motion and a graceful high-flying update. The little girl's levels--though outnumbered probably 5:1--are not as strong; she controls more awkwardly, and her broad figure makes it easier to accidentally hit spikes, blades, etc. But her levels, like I said, are infrequent; they act as a sort of breather from the main, catty game, and are not nearly as difficult as the cat's, so they're mostly unobtrusive--just somewhat unnecessary. Its other downfall is its slight story and beautiful but tragically brief and basic cutscenes. But these elements are really just a frame for the excellent precision platforming.4.5/5"

,Not Recommended,248730,8971231,"Posted: 4 February, 2014",all,toddhunter,"Did you ever play Limbo, Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV and think ""these are fun games, but what somebody really needs to do is combine them together?"" No, I didn't either and if you are the type of person coming up with these ideas it might be time to take a step back from gaming for a while.But once you come back again, A walk in the dark might be just the game for you.Going in I had very different expectations for the title. The screens promised typical indie platforming with a nimble cat protagonist. I also expected some sort of dark and foreboding story through long levels that ultimately didn't go anywhere. In reality, there is a little bit of story there but the game didn't seem to think it was important so I won't dwell on it either. What does matter is how it plays and this is where I got something quite different.You take the before mentioned artwork of Limbo, add in short Super Meat Boy type levels and just when you are getting used to the game it becomes VVVVVV before cycling back through once again. It is a strange sort of mashup given the heritage is so obvious, but strangely the game doesn't really offer anything new. If you have played those games you should know what to expect here and very little more. The levels are short, if you die it is back to the start and pretty much anything you touch will kill you. Rinse and repeat, perhaps trying to get a better time until you are done.While that sounds simple, this isn't to say it is necessarily a bad thing. What it does mean is it is just an uninspired journey, as you navigate the cat Bast and little girl Arielle through the 100 or so short levels. Arielle in particular needs special mention. She is much slower than the cat and doesn't have the double jump or crouch run abilities. On the other hand she has the VVVVVV gravity mechanic allowing her to switch the polarity to run along the ground or the ceiling. While this makes sense from a variety perspective it doesn't change the fact that her levels are a lot less fun to play. Then the game actually gives the exact same ability to the cat for certain stretches, making her inclusion even more redundant.To make up for the lack of ideas the rest of the package needs to be exemplary. A walk in the dark doesn't do the worst job in terms of presentation and the sound and music are as good as you might expect from a modern indie game. It is just that there isn't much else to see or do. The cat (only once again) has a light collecting mechanic as you speed through levels. But unless you are particularly obsessive there doesn't seem to be a lot of point in beating the arbitrary times or gathering all the shiny things.If anything this sums up the whole experience for me. The game is simply ""there"". The titles the mechanics are based on are quality efforts, so those same things work well here and you do get them all in one game. The controls are fine, if not perfect and the graphics and music do the job.Would I then recommend it? Maybe, but only at a very cheap price and you would still be better off with the base games. I could only think that this game could serve as a gateway to the more fleshed out titles perhaps for a younger audience (but those games do an excellent job of leading in new players too).So overall, I would have to rate this as a game I have played."

There is no tutorial in-game at all, which I personally found strange, but the gameplay is very intuitive and can be picked up by the end of the first stage.The on-rails running parts came as a slight shock on the first encounter of them, as it was unexpected. These stages are fun,  and contain gravity flipping parts, but I prefered the platforming stages.The gravity-flipping platorming stages I found to be a bit clunky. The descent when flipping felt heavy and weighted, not exactly what you want when landing on a small platform surrounded by spikes. These were the stages that I dislked the most.Overall, I quite enjoy this game.

Other reviewers have compared the game to Braid, VVVVVV, and LIMBO.  I haven't played LIMBO yet so I can't comment on that; and I don't think it has anything like the unique atmosphere of Braid.  It certainly resembles VVVVVV in some mechanics, but VVVVVV had checkpoints everywhere, whereas in this game every death sends you to the beginning of the level – which makes it a lot more challenging\frustrating.I completed this game and all but one of the achievements in under 17 hours (a glitch has caused Steam to add about 10 hours to my total), and I tend to take longer to complete games than the average person – so if you're willing to invest about this amount of time, and if you're attracted to overcoming challenges, then you should get this game."

The story is simple, but cute in a kind of LIMBO sort of way.On the down side, the challenge comes from the lack of minute control over your character, and the fact that merely brushing something can kill you. In other words, the challenge comes from trying to operate the game's mechanics, rather than any real sort of puzzle or manipulation. Even early on, it may take several tries to finish a level, and you may feel like you passed or failed on luck.Bottom Line:I recommend the game for people who have a love for challenging platformers, and the feel of games like LIMBO.

First the positives:- Addictive gameplay where failure actually makes you want to try again- Decent accompanied music- Over 100 levels for you to play through- The learning curve is well thought out as levels get progressively more difficult especially after lvl 70 or so- Simple controls- Rewarding when you make itThe negatives:- Biggest flow is the movement precission and pixel hunting. What do I mean by that? More often that not you will be trying to make a jump to a small platform while evading ton of deadly things all of which kill you on contact. This wouldn't be a drawback if the movement controls were precise, but instead there is tons of artifical inertia which doesn't seem natural at all. This is most evident when playing as a girl vs a cat, but it is super frustrating later when you are hunting for the exact pixel position from where to jump and where to land, few pixels off and you start over. It doesn't help that it's hard to predict just how much and far your cat will leap so you end up training yourself to do a perfect run.- Repetative graphics/music- The music actually worked against me as its beat can deconcetrate and make you jump in the wrong moment.

Indeed, it is hard and you will die a lot, but the animation of cat's death is a masterpiece. Levels are quiet short but nothing like a ""walk"", starting from level 3 or so. There are few defects relating the death range of the spikes and Bast bugs (like when the cat freezes in the jumping pose and you have to start over). Music is also a little bit monotomous (considering the fact that you will be forced to over and over).Still, all in all, A Walk in the Dark is a great platformer that could make you both love it and hate it at the same time. So just sharpen your running-jumpimg-climbing skills and you will feel such a pride after all :D"

Although I, like many reviewers, prefer the cat levels, it's a tough choice, because inverting gravity as the girl is SO COOL. Even if you do it just to die. Because death is so pretty!Slightly punishing, but so exquisite to look at, games like this are why I choose to play indie games over AAA titles.

,Recommended,248730,9324518,"Posted: 2 March, 2014",all,noibn,"Did you make it through Super Meat Boy without throwing your controller through the screen? Have you played and enjoyed the gravity-reversing platformer VVVVVV? Are you a fan of auto-run levels in games like BIT.TRIP Runner? Did you like the dark aesthetics of Limbo? Are you a cat lover? If the answer to 2 or more of the above questions is ""Yes"", then you will probably like this game.For the most part, the gameplay is very Meat Boy-esque, with short levels full of spikes, saws, and other nasty obstacles. You play as a cat whose goal is to make it to the end of each level in one piece, which is easier said than done. It's a very simple game, mechanically - your only abilities are jumping (including advanced wall-jumping techniques) and crouching. There are also two other types of level variations: ""auto-run"" and ""gravity-swap"". In the ""auto-run"" levels, you have no control over the cat except to jump or crouch as the level scrolls by automatically at high speed. The ""gravity-swap"" levels, in which you play as a little girl instead of the cat, feature gravity-swapping gameplay similar to VVVVVV. Aesthetically, the game is really nice looking, with dark silhouette foregrounds and backgrounds of varying colors and styles. It's sort of a mashup between Limbo and NightSky, and works well. I must also make a note of the soundtrack, which is pretty good. The music is fairly low-key and consists of nice piano arrangements, with a few additional variations in the later levels.So how does it actually play? For the most part, it's good... but it's not perfect. Hard-core platformers like this really need to nail the mechanics perfectly - the controls and the character's interaction with the world need to be spot-on, so that when you die, you feel like it was your fault, and not the game's. Unfortunately that is not always the case here. An especially frustrating aspect of the game is the collision detection, which feels very inconsistent and ""wrong"" at times. You will die from spikes that you swear were nowhere you, and other such inconsistencies. Ultimately, you just have to learn (and make peace with) the quirks of the game and try to be super-aware of exactly how you are jumping in certain situations. The ""auto-run"" levels, in particular, can be a nightmare, requiring pixel-perfect timing of jumps to complete.That said, for all of these rough edges and frustrations, I still think this is a pretty good game overall, considering its low-budget indie nature. It is very much worth checking out if you like hard-core 2D platformers like Super Meat Boy. This isn't nearly as complex or polished as that game, but for the amount of content you get (100+ levels) and the reasonable price, I think it's worth picking up. Again, that is assuming you are up to the challenge - despite the cute exterior, this is not a casual game. Some of the later levels can get pretty difficult. So if you don't have a lot of patience, you might want to hold off on a purchase. Additionally, as is the norm for 2D platformers that require precise input, I also recommend avoiding this game unless you have a controller."

The soundtrack is nice and calm, but it's nothing special, although it does help to set the mood.The gameplay is very challenging. You will die. A lot. And you will be very frustrated. I found that it was one of those games where there is one really hard part near the end of the level that you'll die on over and over. Then once you respawn you'll try to rush through the first part of the level and die even more. Rinse and repeat. I got pretty annoyed at some points but I wasn't annoyed at the game, just annoyed at my inability to get past an obstacle.On the downside, the default controls are horrendous. I had to re-map my controls multiple times while playing but there's really only 2 actions so it's not too hard to get used to.This game is really good if you just want something entertaining to sit down and play for a few minutes or half an hour. It definitely isn't something you would want to sit down and play for hours at a time as the gameplay is pretty repetitive and you would probably end up wanting to rip your hair out by the time you were finished.Overall it looks great, sounds nice, and plays smoothly, but the controls are a bit mediocre."

I'm not a huge fan of platformers, let alone TIMED platformers, but this is still a fun game to pass the time with, albeit really frustrating (for me) for a few reasons.The controls seem really unresponsive/wonky at times. I don't know if that's because I'm using a controller, but given that this has full controller support, I would've imagined it wouldn't have been a problem. The buttons either don't respond, or respond too little. I could depress the jump button as hard as possible one moment for a long jump, and get a measly weak jump that'll kill me and restart the level, or the exact opposite issue with the same outcome. It also doesn't exactly feel like being as smooth as a cat; in fact, in some areas, I've seen my own three-legged cat jump more gracefully than Bast, which is just depressing. Bast just doesn't seem to respond to the controller in a typical cat fashion, and won't act like a cat when it really counts, especially around wall-climbing/jumping segments. Not to mention that the movements are really picky, but I feel like that's more a margin of error issue.With that being said, the margin of error is so ridiculously small that it gets on my nerves, because of the movement issues. I could be completely in the clear of a patch of spikes, and still get killed by the very last one, despite being far above it. Or, in the case of the little girl, the movement is so incredibly sensitive when gravity's being inverted and you're having to constantly flip up or down to avoid spikes and move through the level, that you could so much as look at the screen wrong and be shoved into the wall of spikes without having even touched the D-pad/thumbstick, whichever you prefer to use on a controller.My last small issue, and it's probably a very minor one, is the lack of checkpoints, which I wholly believed were what the dandelions were for. Instead, I discovered they're just for a ridiculous achievement. Imagine my irritability when I've gotten 3/4s of the way through a tough level with all of the above issues working against me, find a dandelion thinking it's a checkpoint, only to die and have to start the headache ALL OVER.I do like this game, don't get me wrong. I just think there are a few issues that are a serious turn-off in terms of no one's gonna want to sit here and play this game for more than half an hour at most before leaving it alone for weeks on end, because looking at it only reminds one of the frustration endured. Do I think this game is worth seven bucks? Not particularly, but I didn't pay that much, so I don't really have to worry about it."
