76561197970987222,Not Recommended,248970,7933610,"Posted: 5 December, 2013",all,misterBK,"There were no negative reviews when I looked, so I gave it a chance.  Based on the video, I was expecting a bit more control over the action.  The gamplay is too simple to keep me interested, but people who like simple tap-on-time games might like it.It's a ""hit the button on cue"" game.  The guy automatically runs, and you have to press up, down, left or right on cue to make him jump, slide, or speed up.  Special tricks other than those basic moves are done by hitting the up arrow when you're right underneath a 'special trick' cue block.  You can't do any trick at any time.  You can jump or slide, but not speed up or choose how you vault over an object.There are no options other than resolution, and there's no gamepad support.  (You'd have to use JoyToKey to assign keyboard mappings to your gamepad.)  You can't change key bindings.It has user profile support, so if more than one person plays on your Steam account they can do so without changing your progress.  There doesn't seem to be any reason for this though, because there's only one way to do any given level, and you can go back and redo them at any time.It's not a bad game or anything.  The animation is really well done, and the moves flow really well.  It plays like a lot of online Flash games, where something complex is happening and you introduce mild changes to it by tapping a button at a specific time.[EDIT]:I was getting complaints that people thought I hadn't put enough time into the game to form a good opinion.  So, I dove back in.As a result, I'm downgrading my review.  In addition to the gameplay being mind numbingly boring and not delivering on gamepad support (which has since been removed from the store page), there are critical gameplay issues.First, you have almost no control over what move the guy does to pass an obstacle.  He might vault it, or he might jump.  The game does seem to take a cue from how close you are to it, but it's a very small target and it makes a lot of difference to where you end up when you regain character control.Second, whereas he's pretty smart about picking cool-looking moves, he's dumb as a sack of bricks when it comes to jump distance.  You can't hop between platforms if they're too close.  You'd think he'd figure it out, but he's like ""Nope, you pushed up, I'm going for full air-time even if it makes no sense and I fall down that pit.""  I thought game devs had figured this mechanic out with Mario 1 for NES, but no, apparently not.Third, you very often find that although you think you did fine in a level and picked up all of the pickups, you do not have enough to buy the next level's skills.  You have to either go back and grind that level again, or just play the next level without its extra tricks.Fourth, I was told world 2 was better and I should get to it before judging.  Well, turned out after I suffered through world 1, I didn't have enough stuff to unlock entry to the mystical wonderland of world 2.  When you finish world 1, you most likely have to go back and grind world 1 again until you've accumulated enough stars or coins.  (And, it's a LOT of coins.)Fifth, pickups seem to often be a trap.  Going for them sometimes seems to be the wrong thing to do, and if you do you always lose.Sixth, you quite often can't see far enough to the right to make a decision in time to pass an area.  When you do the sensible thing, you find out mid-jump that the sensible thing traps you in a corner and makes you restart.  So, you just have to beat your head on it until you memorize when those things happen, so you can get by.  Given how limited your visibility is vs. the screen real estate available, it looks ridiculous on a PC.  Then, just to rub it in, every now and then the camera is scripted to zoom out to the distance where you CAN see things, but only when you don't really need it.So, I'm downgrading from ""I can see some people liking this game but I don't"", to ""I don't understand why people like this game.""Let the rage comments flow.  I've uninstalled this to reclaim the 56 megs of disk, and I'm no longer wishing there was a ""meh"" option so that I could leave this informative rather than negative."

After playing the game for over an hour, I 100% approve of buying this game. It's cheap (less then $10 USD!), installs really fast (no kidding, this game is a puny 56MB!), and plays fast too. It's perfect for people who enjoy games like Mirror's Edge (both real game and the 2D platformer made by Brad Borne, creator of the Fancy Pants Adventures games) and platformers like Super Mario, Sonic, and BIT.TRIP RUNNER. Trying to get three stars in all the courses is quite a challenge and requires a lot of dying (which you get achievements for both getting three stars in all courses and the amount of times you've died). Even though I haven't beaten the game yet, I'd recommend all of my friends to at least try/buy this game."

This burst range from either to a hour, or for the most part, to thirty minutes per interval. This is only because after a while; unfortunately, the game does feel like it becomes a bit repetative from just pressing up, down, left, and right. Yet, I find myself always drawn back to the game, always wondering what badass parkour moves I can pull off next, or by curiosity to see what the next level has in store for me. For me, the game doesn't dissapoint as running from multiple hunters can make the game seem hectic, and keep the game interesting, along with the music and the environment that the style of vector makes. Seeing the obstacles in black, and the enviroment in full, glorious colors really depicts how the main character, vector, feels. This, at least to me, really ties in with the introduction scene of vector. Being trapped and doing the same tasks on a daily basis, and only having one desire, and that is to be free! However, there are some things that really make me furious at certain times while playing Vector. At times, there will be certain animations, or scripts, that you want vector to do, yet he won't do it. I found several times that I press the up button several seconds away from the object yet he would do the animation that would prohibit me from getting a certain cube. This would then cause me to restart the level just so I can get that one damned cube so I can progess. Because of this, it gives the game a sense of trial and error that is very misleading to me, for the ""challenging"" aspect of this game is to remember where to exactly jump so you can get all the cubes and tricks within that certain level. However, after beating that level, I get a sense of accomplishment, and sense of pride that makes it worth while for me.So I'm giving Vector a 7/10, to me the game is very fun, but it's fun in short bursts, delays in script triggers, and level memorization rather than an actual challenge really knocks the game back from what it actually could be."

Otherwise... well, you have been warned."

,Recommended,248970,8009830,"Posted: 11 December, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"Vector is a fairly good game. It's a mix of Canabalt and Mirror's Edge. However, the game actually uses levels and because of that it's not an endless runner like Canabalt is. The game itself is played as a platformer but you don't have to actually run; the game will do this for you. It's up to you to collect as many coins as you can and perform the various tricks scattered throughout the levels. It's because of the constant running/climbing and doing tricks that many people will be reminded of Mirror's Edge.Each level you'll be chased. This adds a certain layer of tension to the game but since you're not fully controlling your character it will most likely not scare you as much as it should. The graphics are nicely detailed and the animations of your character are mostly fluid. It's unfortunate that the character itself isn't all that detailed, lowres even, even if it's a silhouette.By collecting money found in the levels you'll be able to purchase new tricks. Use the new tricks in the later levels to earn even more cash. It's a vicious circle. Ok, I wouldn't say vicious, but at least it's a fun way to keep replaying some of the levels, even if they're frustratingly hard sometimes. Earning 3 stars in every level will take you a long, long time. And you'll have to restart quite often because even the slightest mistake can result in failure. Thankfully the levels are only a few minutes long so it's not all that important, but still worth a mention.It's also where the game fails in being a very good or excellent game. Some of the levels require a good memory and others will have you take leaps of faith because you can't see where you have to land in order to keep going. This can be frustrating because you also need (a bit of) luck if you want to finish some of these levels. It would've been better if you could see far ahead so you would know exactly where to go and if you could just take one path and not more, or at least make all of these paths accessible.In the end Vector is still pretty fun to play and considering the price it's easily worth the money. There's more than enough value here.[Rating: 74/100]"
,Recommended,248970,18168912,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,JayTC,"Since Vector is one of my first steam games, I felt that I had to make this game my first review. After 33 hours clocked in game time I've finally collected every achievement, got all the stars and also finished Hunter mode completely. So I feel like I can give me full opinion on the game. (without spoilers ofcourse)Quick Game Summary:Vector is an action packed 2D sidescrolling parkour game, with a basic but kinda gripping (atleast to me) storyline. You wanna break free from control by ''The Man'', in this case ''Big Brother'' and the hunters are after you. Basicly all you need to know is in the discription in the store page.Gameplay:Vector as I said before is a 2D Sidescroller, but not one with free controll like, let's say Mario. No, Vector is an on-rails autoscroller where, depending on the situation, you either press down to slide, up to jump or hold to the right to sprint. You also have these parkour tricks you can purchase to do cool tricks in the level by pressing up when you land on a trick. Unlike the Facebook port and free version on the mobile phone, you get enough money at the end of the level, to purchase all the tricks that are needed for the next level. The game gets pretty hard and challenging which is a good thing, but the hardest part of the game is the Hunter Mode, where you play as the hunter and try to hunt down Vector. I like to call this part the hard mode since thats the reason why it took me so long, but it's extremely satisfying when you get Vector at the end and it adds for lots of replayability.Vector is in the end a fun timewaster and I recommend you atleast try it out, it's worth the price and you may end up liking it.I'm still waiting on that level creator though... Oh and also super psyched for Vector 2."
,Not Recommended,248970,8010853,"Posted: 11 December, 2013",all,PFC Ward [29ID],"I bought this game due to my fondness for mirrors edge, and the fact that this game seemed like a pretty fun idea. Seeing this game actually reminded me of the 2d mobile version of mirrors edge which I enjoyed greatly. However, upon actually playing I was met with disapointment. This game is more of a, press ""X"" button when you are told to. I definetely do not feel the ""Free"" in Free Running while playing. The custom moves are fun, however, when learning the game I missed a couple of the weird coins on of the first levels. Because of this, as I kept playing I was always just short on the coins which were needed to perform these special moves. This game was a good idea. We need another free running game. However, this isn't the one we need right now. The whole game feels like its on rails, and while an argument against this may be ""Well, its a 2-D platformer"" just isn't going to cut it, as plenty of more creative and engaging platformers have been made in this style, and have pulled it off well. Also, it would've been nice if instead of having to have a certain amount of coins to perform the special moves (which is clearly in effect so that players are forced to go back and play more of the levels they've beaten for no reason), special moves could have been a key combo you could press.I do not recommend this game due to the lack of much player involvement beyond just pressing the right key at the right time."
,Recommended,248970,7906307,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,Spooner,"I bought this game today since its pretty darn cheap and because I enjoy the occasional indie game. The game being a platformer too was a huge plus, so I decided to go for it. The game is a 2D platformer which has you play some nameless character with no apparent story at all other than the description of the game (I suppose you have to think of your own story).Each level is a setting filled with obstacles that you must traverse using free running techniques, while being chased by a single cop who has the same parkour skills as you, and is absolutely relentless (makes no mistakes in his running either). The levels get tougher as you go, and sometimes border on the frustrating, but enjoyable nonetheless. Along the way you must collect money in the form of floating icons which give you access to further levels and parkour techniques. Furthermore, you are rated on your performance at the completion of each level, and awarded stars based on your performance.All in all, its a very enjoyable indie title and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of platformers. Dont let the fact that its 2D discourage you (especially if you are a Mirror's Edge fan) as the animations are fluid, the tension is great and the feeling of a perfectly timed and executed level is very satisfying. Add to that the fact that its less than 5 bucks for now. Buy it people. You wont regret it."

I clicked on it, thought the image/cover looked cool and see what the game was about.I've always been a fan of freerunning and parkour games and there aren't a lot out there. Even though the game is in 2D, the animations look amazing and the game runs smoothly. It would most definitely worth the money and I can't stop playing it.This game reminds me of Gravity Guy on the iOS or Miniclip where you run away from someone who chases you down, except much smoother, more realistic and a different theme.The background adds a nice touch to the game as it's colorful and it does feel like you're running along the roof or in a building. Wherever you are, whether it's paper flying everywhere in the office or you sliding down a crane, you would always you feel you are that freerunner.Definitely a must-play game and would definitely recommend it to people who love Platformer games."

It's a little slow paced, and if you fail it puts you right at the start, which can be annoying.  Visuals are not anything to ""wow"" about, but they serve the game well.  The basic mechanics make the game very accessable but not challenging in the slightest.  Some of the acheivments do not seem to work, but I can look past that.  Buying the moves forces you to replay missions, which can be good, unless you hated a specfic level.

They keep the levels very interesting as do the increasing basic skills required from each area. Fun to play and equaly fun to watch. bonus level 1-5 is my favorite because it uses 42 tricks, which is all trickes learned up to that point from the normal levels of area 1 and the first 4 bonus levels. i hope when an update adding bonus levels to area 3 is added they do another level with all the learnable tricks.

There is a Facebook version but a few notable differences between this and the Android and FB versions are: the game has incredible HD graphics. I've been playing the FB version for months and the full screen view on my 1980x1080 HD monitor is gorgeous. Also gaining coins to access new moves is a lot less grindy because you also gain coins from the star rating for completing each level. It still presents the same challenge as all the other versions but without replaying the same level 5 times just to earn enough to get more cool parkour moves. Not to mention lots of Steam achievements for the hunters out there.The developers are currently working on added features including a hunter mode and level editor. While this is all good and nice I would like to see leaderboards and cloud support in addition to the things already planned. At $7 I think it's a fair price for this game would definitely recommend it to anyone on the fence to try the demo or the FB version. This game is lots of fun.

Your character runs from an enemy that is chasing you. If he catches up, you're tased and you have to restart. Along each level or 'route' are cubes scattered throughout the level. If you collect these cubes you are rewarded with 100% completion for that level. Also there are coins that you can collect; these are used to purchase additional parkour-style moves for your character, many of which are also required to '100%' a level.It's fun but at the same time incredibly frustrating, especially if you plan to master all achievements this game has to offer (57 in total). You will fail, and end up restarting levels constantly. It's a lot of trial and error, but the payoff is sweet once you pull off moves with precision.Overall a fun time-waster that's worth it, and is pleasant on the eyes as well (the fluid animations are great).

The thing I hate the most is when you have to jump ever so slightly earlier to catch something in the air. The only way to play it is to memorize every single jump.The point of any running game is to get used to the pace in order to know when to perform a move. In Bit Trip Runner for example, I knew exactly when to press a button, but there's always an uncertainty in Vector no matter how many times I execute the same moves.The same music track on every level can really get on your nerves after the 20th retry. There should be more variety.The animations are excellent and very fluid. I wanted to enjoy them, buit I had to concentrate on memorizing the level all the time.If this game focused more on the chase instead of the point collection, and if it allowed a bigger margin of error, it could have been a solid recommendation.

(not all 3 stars yet).I played and completed the 3D 'First Person View' game 'Mirrors Edge' on both X360 and PC back when GFWL was at it's peak. What some may remember was that there was a 2D 'side scrolling' game of 'Mirrors Edge' as well. I haven't spent as much time with that and although I don't remember clearly but think you may have had control over the players movement, not sure. Anyway, I quite enjoyed the 'Mirrors Edge' games and the uniqueness of them.So, if you also have fond memories of those games then you may also like 'Vector'.This game is a 2D 'side scrolling' 'runner' game. I say 'runner' because you don't get to control your characters direction of movement. You only control when you jump, slide, and do tricks over obstacles based on 'timing' of your key presses, etc. This might sound 'simple' but a few things keep it challenging;You have enemies chasing you which you need to keep ahead of by maintaining your speed via flow of movement past obstacles.You have to decide on the fly what you want to do; sometimes you want to jump earlier to get on top of an obstacle, sometimes you want to volley over them.Hitting into an obstacle will cost you a small delay as your character composes themselves and gets moving again.Some levels will require a few runs so you can workout which 'path' you want to take.To '3 star' a level you basically have to be perfect.If you want to '3 star' all levels and collect everything then I can see a lot of replayability here.Sometimes you probably have to play a level 10 or more times to get past it so there is some repetitiveness. If you are ok with that aspect then you may enjoy the challenge. It can be funny sometimes seeing the trouble your character or the 'hunter/chaser' gets into. Had to chuckle a few times when my character met a demise when I knew I had hit an incorrect key or got my timing completely wrong.Some cool things I have noticed so far;Collect coins in the levels which you can use to buy 'stunts' which are needed if you want to get '3 stars'.There is quite a variety of character animations and the mentioned 'stunts' add more.There is a 'hunted' mode which I am guessing means you play a 'hunter' chasing a 'runner' down for a change.Some levels have you following an 'npc runner' which was refreshing and added another level of challenge again.Plus I would like to give a special thanks to the very helpful developer that helped me access an older version of this game that works with my 'aging' computer.After reading all that if you think this 'sounds like your cup of tea' then I would recommend this game to you. You could also try the 'demo' version first to see what you think."

You press one of the arrow keys to jump or slide or run faster or slow down, but the kind of jump/vault you do is controlled by the game. Getting three stars in each level doesn't force you to learn parkour principles, just memorize the correct sequence of key presses for each level. So what I'm saying is there's no depth to this game. World 1 is terrible boring, so I tried world 2, the construction yard. It's only slightly more complex, not enough to grab me. I've played 1.5 hours so far, much long enough for the game to get fun. I'm doneThat said, it looks good, the animations are decent, the music sucks and doesn't loop seamlessly, and the sounds are pretty good.

As such, it is one of the best of its type, with very fluid controls and animation, and a decent (although overly repetitive) soundtrack.I personally found the entire genre of auto-runners to be slightly less fun on the PC than on my tablet or phone, but I must admit, even with PC controls this was a blast to play in short spurts. My only real complaint is that you have to be doing nothing else to pick up the tricks you ""need"" to collect throughout the level. If you have another button pressed even for a second of the window for the trick pick-up, it won't register.Also, it would be nice if you had more control over your character, being able to use the tricks you get when you want, maybe even combo them for points or something. Instead, picking up and unlocking the tricks seems to be largely a waste of time, as the tricks you know don't carry over level to level. This last complaint is really a complaint with the whole auto-runner genre in general, though, so its hard to fault Vector for it.Ultimately, if you like auto-runners, Vector is a sure win for you, if you don't normally care for them, its still worth checking out, as its professional layout, excellent graphics, and high replayability may make you reconsider the genre."

There are a new ones that pop up from time to time, but not as much as I was hoping for. This is a Parkour freestyle game after all, right? Only three locations are unlockable which is dissapointing; however, the levels in them at least have 11 that are well designed for this kind of game not to mention the bonus levels you can play on these 3 locations by unlocking each bonus level with stars you gain from the orignal levels. The game is fun, but with the amount of variety that is here is really, really disappointing. The framerate may be hell of alot better than on the mobile device, but for 8 dollars of a game like this I can simply not recommend. I will recommend this game to the mobile where it was orginally from. You do get the full game for 1 dollar on the google play store saving you 7 bucks, but be prepared for crashes and extreme framerate drops.

I simply had to play it, I couldn't stop myself. Then it happened.I stopped dead in my tracks. As soon as I got through the first set of Hunter levels, I couldn't get any further. I had to pay 6000 credits to unlock the next area. Since then I've been stuck grinding, squeezing all the coins I can out of the levels I can't get 3 stars on. Nothing worked, I couldn't get my star level up, and I wasn't getting near enough coins to keep a steady rate to 6000. I honestly don't even know how this happened, but thankfully credits don't cost real money.Nearly all my interest in this game just disappeared.

,Recommended,248970,8563012,"Posted: 4 January, 2014",all,Bent Spork,"If you liked Mirrors Edge or the chase scene of Casino Royale, I recommend trying out the Vector Demo on Steam.The premise is that you're a worker drone in a future, dystopian, totalitarian society.  One day you snap and make a run for it.  And you run.  And run.  and run.  :)So, basically it's a 2D side scroller where your character is running away from one of the policeman (who will taze you if they catch up to you).  The cool part is that you are basically running an obstacle course, as you make your getaway with some Parkour-ish flair.The levels are achievement-based -- your score is based on time, bonuses (which are objects you pick up as you run), and stunts performed (these are cue'd at certain points in each level and make it easier for you to pick up bonus objects or time the upcoming obstacle).  You also pickup coins, which you use to unlock additional tricks.A valid criticism is that this really isn't ""free"" running.  That is correct.  It's much more of a timed and scripted obstacle course.  You have to figure out the proper (or workable) timing to get all the items, coins, and trick cues.  This is interesting because it means that until you unlock all the tricks used in a level, you're never going to get the full score on the first try.  On the other hand, each level so far has been challenging enough that I've had to run through it multiple times to get the perfect 3-star score.  During that time, I usually pick up enough coins to unlock the needed tricks, usually around the time that I've gotten familiar enough with the level to understand how the tricks will help me with certain obstacles.For an indie game, it's quite well done and surprisingly tense.  The policeman is never far behind you.  He's quite good, and a mistake on your part can easily have him almost within arm reach as you scramble to get back up to speed.Even the failures can be amusing.  I, at least, find it amusing when, after sliding, jumping, and flipping my way over the scenery like a badas, I suddenly run off an edge and fall to my death.  Or just flat out slam into a wall.  Or faceplant on the ground.  I don't know why I find it funny, but I do.  :)  It takes the edge off of having to restart the level.  The novelty does wear off, though, and some of the levels are just crazy difficult.  Having to restart a complicated level after each failure does get frustrating after a while.Having said all that, even though I normally hate platformers, I don't regret picking up Vector."

So when I saw Vector I figured it would be right up my alley.  Unfortunately, it's proven to be pretty disappointing.They went with a very similar approach as Mirror's Edge in that you play a man living in a world that has been cleaned to the point of oppression.  So you're constantly running from the cops, and they're always right on your heels.  So ok, I don't really mind that.  It seems interesting to me that free runners are so frequently depicted as anti-oppression rebels because they want to run free, but really who cares.  This isn't about the story, it's about the game and the gameplay stinks.For all the freedom from oppression rhetoric, Vector has very severe limits on what you can do.  You don't control anything.  Your runner just runs and you push buttons to make him jump, slide, vault or accelerate based on what sort of obstacle you're up against.  It's purely a timing game.  Push a button at the right time and get a biscuit, I mean jump over an instant death pit.There are some decent production values put into this game, and I wish I could recommend it, but at the end of the day they have managed to make a concept like free running across building tops boring to play."

It starts as a nice freerun sym with a clear flow but by level 10 if becomes Mario, when if you do not press the right button at the right time (and they have a very strict definition of ""right time"") you fail, and fail, and fail until ""repetitio matter studiorum est"". This need for repetition is agravated by the fact that you do not see very much in front of you so you will have to resort to memorizing the level.After the first 7-8 levels, the game no longer has flow, no longer gives you the joy of making quick decisions and managing in ""new"" circumstances. It becomes a grind to memorize and achieve perfectionism and for that we have work, not play.Also, I think this game is a port from mobile where it is a fremium. They did not bother to remove the remenants of the freemium model though and at a certain level you start to not be able to afford all the tricks, requiring more grind (or microtranzactions but this is not on PC) to get the money with which to buy the tricks with which to be able to achieve 3 stars runs and thus make money for other tricks.In conclusion, I'd say this game is worth about 0.99 as most mobile games.

The camera always zooms in, to give a more ""cinematic"" view, so the only way to play the game is to memorize the levels. Every time you jump, you don't see what follows, so you jump randomly hoping that you land correctly.This is the most silly mistake I've ever seen in a platform game.

After the first level or two, not only is there no way at all to get all the bonuses/powerups on one run through (because you jump off a ledge instead of sliding) but you can even fail a level completely because you don't know to run off a ledge instead of jumping when there's no visual cue what to do, or you simply take the wrong path.You have no real control over the parkour elements, it randomly selects how you vault over things, a lot of fancier things you only do if you hit a button when you run past a prominently displayed icon, and generally this game just is not as fun as I expected, and I wasn't expecting all that much really."

This should have stayed an iPhone game, it's boring and repetitive levels are what you'd expect from something you can get free off the app store. The game does say that there are 100+ moves to perform. That is true, but you won't be performing them without needlepoint accuracy OR unlocking them. You have to UNLOCK TRICKS in order to perform them. I don't know about you, but limitations in games are the BANE of a gamer like me.

You want more control over your  movements, like in games such as Mirror's Edge, but with stunts? NOPE. Ontop of this, it's just plain frustrating. Trying to get all collectables in a level will mean you will have to play it OVER and OVER. But even if you aren't going for them - you'll have to play the level a few times over because you will die.

Naturally he runs and jumps out the nearest window, now your goal is to help the captain outrun the Google employe by using your arrow keys to help him jump, slide, and mock the corporation by doing sick parkour (because that's how you fight the system) Google also has an abundance of money and resources which they have kindly left flying (hoverboard tech) around the city aveage Joe recieves +100 freedom fighter points for each box of souls he collects in each level, and +10 currency for each coin which is the best Google can do for his pension currently. If Captain Joe collects all of the boxes and performs every trick in a level you can bet your life you're going to get a three star rating, and the feeling of Osteoarthritis finger pain that comes with restarting a level 30+ times to get the last God damn box.Once you've completed classic mode you can head into Hunter mode and experience what it feels like to steal company resources while also losing your soul to the man, you sell out.Once you've stolen enough office supplies you can buy your self some kickass new fabric to cover up the captain because as rebels do, he tore off his clothes as he ran away from the man (that'll show 'em) buy a hat beacuse it's sunny, buy a scarf because it's cold, buy some shorts because they're cool, now put all that on together you unemployed hipster trash and you're ready to stick it to the man.Great game, ran smoothe as anything, (my computer makes George Kennady look young) entertaining and fun. All levels were well designed with the exception of bonus 3-8 Hunter mode, for some unknown reason if you restart the level manually using hotkeys it then begins to run incredibly slow, but apart from that small glitch it was perfect.9/10 Would recommend to my fat friends to show them what skinny people do at work"

76561198009316076,Recommended,248970,31022768,Posted: 8 April,all,The Matlock,"So, let me preface this review by saying that yes, you can get this game for free on your cell phone. However the free version has less content, requires a purchase to get everything you have in the Steam version, and has microtransactions. I say this because most of the negative reviews focus on this besides the game itself. With that being said, is it worth it to spend your money on this version? Absolutely.When I first played the demo of Vector years ago, I didn't like the flow of the game. But it ultimately came down to me not understanding it. I would eventually get around to playing it again and it impressed me enough to get the full version. It's not your normal game for sure, but for what's here you should get a lot of enjoyment and hours out of it.The story is pretty simple (and unfortunately, it's ultimately pointless to the game). In the future humanity is under totalitarian control, as we are conditioned to think, work, and act alike. Your character decides to break free and runs away, with guards from the government in pursuit of him. Your objective is to escape by reaching the end of multiple stages, laid out over three areas. The appearance of the game is minimal. Backgrounds are static, and the models of your character, your pursuer, and all objectives are cast in a black sillouette. The music is one track that repeats in every stage, with a different track for the menus. It *can* get a bit repetitive but just slap on some techno or metal in that case and it works just as well.What you're after here is the meat of the game. It functions similar to an endless runner, as your character will move on their own. However you press buttons at certain points to make him vault, run, and jump around the various obstacles in the stage, in order to keep up your speed and eventually escape the guard who is after you. It may sound simplistic but a lot of stages are set up so you need to hit your buttons at the exact right time or spot, otherwise you'll collide into a wall, fall into a pit, or be captured. There is a restart button which you'll be finding yourself pressing quite often.But that's not all there is to it! When you complete a stage, you get one star. Throughout every level there are grey cubes to collect, and collecting all of them gets you one additonal star. These may require you to take a different path, and jump and vault at different times. *On top* of that you collect coins as you progress, either in the stage or by completing a new stage, and these coins allow you to purchase parkour moves. These moves can be triggered at certain spots during each level, and if you trigger all the moves you get another star. So in order to three star every level you need to get every bonus cube, have all the moves unlocked, and successfully hit every move. Sound easy? It's not.You need to gain a certain number of stars in each area in order to unlock the next one, even if you clear every stage. *Plus* there are bonus levels in each area and to unlock the bonus levels you need to get so many stars, *and* each bonus level also has stars to gain by collecting bonuses and hitting the parkour moves. PHEW. Yeah so there's TONS of content here.Oh yeah, and once you do all that, you also have ""Hunter Mode"" which allows you replay every single level again but as the guard instead of the guy running away. This presents an EXTRA challenge as not only will you need to get all the bonuses, hit all the moves, but you have to be better then perfect in your timing because you need to catch the guy before he reaches the exit, otherwise you need to start over the stage. I only got three stages into Hunter Mode before I had to stop due to the difficulty. So yeah, for what you spend on this game? You have hours of enjoyment (or frustration even).So if you want to succeed in this level go hit the buy button and add this to your library. You won't regret it."
,Recommended,248970,23748907,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,atheoang3l0,"Simple, yet very challenging.If you play it casually, i.e. just getting to the end of the level without getting caught, it's an easy, enjoyable time-waster. But if you try to attain the highest score in each level (and you may want to eventually to get the most out of this game), it can be a very challenging game.Getting all 3 stars requires memorization of the level and good reflexes. Basically, it's trial and error. What I find frustrating is the lack of checkpoints, which means you'll be restarting the level a lot to get those stars. One technique I learned is to use the static objects in the level's background and/or the small dents on the ground or walls as ""indicators"" to know where to execute the appropriate move.While I do like the game, I don't understand why it costs 6.99 USD. It's barely any different from the Android/iOS version, which only costs 0.99 USD. Nekki once mentioned a WIP level editor that would have Steam Workshop support. It would justify the price tag, but it was never implemented and info about it can no longer be seen anywhere. Nekki has most likely scratched it."

To be fair, it's just a series of QTEs, but the music is nice, the graphics are nice, the animations look human at the very least, and it satisfies the part of me that wants to learn parkour but can't. So I really enjoy playing this game, for all of those reasons. And since it's only seven dollars, I would recommend buying it, if what I've said above sounds worth seven dollars to you.(TOO LONG ; DIDN'T READ ABOVE. GOT SOME TIME TO KILL, KEEP SCROLLING)There is one problem I have with it though. On one of the levels (can't remember which, I haven't played it in like a year, totally forgot I had it. I just remember getting really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the game for this), if you are playing on the PC version, it is impossible to get three stars. To get three stars you have to A) Beat the level B) Collect all the squares C) do all the parkour moves. This can be kind of frustrating in general, but I spent ages and ages and ages trying to land down a hole so that I could grab the squares down there. Eventually I looked up a walkthrough. It was a walkthrough for the mobile version. I could tell because the jump and slide buttons were on screen and only slightly opaque. I jumped at the exact time that they jumped, and didn't make it into the hole. In the PC version, that level was built such that it was impossible to get three stars. Bear in mind that it's been a year and there were probably updates. I leave you with this information. Do what you will."
