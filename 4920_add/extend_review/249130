And then I shoved them aside and played through the game myself, cause I was hooked.  I grew up loving both Legos and Marvel.  This is a fantastic merger of both.Pros:- This game has a lighthearted storyline that doesn't take itself too seriously.- The antics and quips made by the characters are humorous and satiristically appropriate.- Kid appropriate means that I can sit down with my children for an hour or two to 'bond.'- Marvel.Neutral:- Gameplay is typical of most lego games; get coins, find gold/red bricks, unlock characters.Cons:- It does get a bit repetative sometimes; gameplay and 'flavor' dialogue.- There are a few bugs still in the game.  Though they don't crop up all that often, it is annoying to have to quit a level simply because the bug prevented your advance.- Flight controls were terrible (or I'm old, and just don't get it)."

,Recommended,249130,7751581,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Evanalmightyyy,"This is by far the greatest Lego game I have played since The Complete Saga. Not only does the game feature a huge roster of playable characters who actually have the personality and abilities of those they represent, but the game also features a unique storyline where the voice acting actually fits the game.The story is fantastic this time around. The voice acting being recorded specifically for the game helps it to not be as cheesy or low quality as before. The cinematics then also can be how they used to be and have a lot more fun and freedom without havign to fit within a prerecorded audio clip.The characters are as high quality as they are numerous. Multiple characters and costumes leave almost no one out (except nightcrawler...) and will have a few choices for everyone. They each are unique and are fun to play and although I do wish Hulk could scale buildings they stick pretty close to th source.Manhattan is a great hub area featuring TONS of content to do either while between missions or at the end of the game and are just looking for tokens for new characters and vehicles.Combat has also been improved where each character has their signature moves and bad guys actually can be comboed and used to make tons of studs. Speaking of studs, there is no lack of them here and you will be hitting 1 millions before half way through the game.Overall it was the best in the series and I really could not think of much to improve on other then some wonky flight controls and some races that were a bit unfair in that regard. BUY THIS!"

,Recommended,249130,20234343,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,Tom,"Lego Marvel Super Heroes is an action adventure game developed by TT games and published by Warner Brothers, releasing in 2013 on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PS4 and Xbox One, and of course, PC and Mac.Game play is similar to that of other Lego titles, you are able to take control of around 150 characters straight out of the Marvel Universe, and each of them have their own abilities. Each of the game’s levels consist of a series of puzzles which use specific characters special abilities, as well as breaking objects to them build other items to help you traverse the environment. In between each level, you enter a free roam type area around the streets of New York. The free roam contains opportunities to complete small side missions which are narrated by none other than Deadpool.  When in the main missions, there are a few side actives to complete too as well, which include Marvel co-creator, Stan Lee; this segment of the game is called “Stan Lee in Peril”.The graphics in Marvel Super Heroes is very much the same as other Lego games, you will find it very hard to fault the visual department of this game; it looks colourful, animated to perfection, everything in the game is made out of Lego, so it has that childish charm that is just gorgeous. There is a wide range of resolution options, but a lack of any other graphical choices, other than texture quality which still only has two levels, high and low.There is really no difficulty in the game, there is no penalty for dying, since you just respawn straight away, you will be stumped for ideas on a few of the puzzles and you will just have to experiment with your characters in order to progress. The boss fights are all uniquely challenging and offer various different waves of battle for you to learn.The game’s level design is perfect; there is an in game “brick counter” which you can fill up by breaking other Lego objects in game for other smaller bricks. I played the game with my partner and we made it our aim to fill this counter on each level, this adds another challenge to the game, and lets you have the satisfaction of breaking tons of Lego and collecting thousands of smaller bricks. On top of this, there are also plenty of small Easter eggs too, which the odd appearance from Deadpool (who doesn’t appear as a main character in the story).We finished the game in just under nine hours on co-op mode with collecting 100% of the bricks on each stage. What makes the Lego games repayable is that after you complete a level, you have the free play option unlocked – this means you can play as any character on that stage to unlock special areas for more side missions and collectables. Whilst on the subject of collectables, there are so many to find! On top of the regular cast of characters, there are over 100 more to find and discover whilst completing side quests, achievements, and finding items.  Complentionists will have a field day with this game.Sadly we did run into a few technical problems during our play through. The main one being one of the levels just freezes all of the time; this is a known bug and the only way you can progress is purely by restarting the level and hoping you are lucky – thankfully this bug is right at the start of the stage, so you don’t lose much progress.  Another issue we ran into was fairly annoying, in that characters can sometimes get stuck in the environment, this isn’t too bad if you are able to kill the character with another player, but sometimes this isn’t possible so the only way you can get around the issue is by restarting the level; this can sometimes be painstakingly annoying if you are right at the end of a stage.  We did have a positive experience both using a 360 controller and the Steam controller to play though. I would strongly recommend anyone picking this game up to use either of the two controller options.I have come to the conclusion that Lego really make fantastic games; and Marvel Super Heroes is no different. You have two of the biggest franchises in the world today and combined them; you have a recipe for success straight away. We had such a blast whilst playing and I would strongly recommend Lego Marvel Super Heroes to any fans of Marvel or Lego out there. The regular price of £14, 99 is spot on as well. If you can get it any cheaper, do not hesitate to pick it up, you won’t be disappointed.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Deadpool joking everywhere (that for me, Deadpool, is always a plus). 50 funny Stan Lee cameos....I think I bought this one (and many other Lego games) for 5€.

There are a lot of jokes and funny moments for the children but even that is ok and it matches to the storyline.I played the game without any DLC and there areA LOTof characters, heroes and villains, from Avengers to X-men to Fantastic Four... Everyone of them has an specific reason to be in the story and it is great, also after finish all the chapters you can change the characters at your will, which is pretty nice.The gameplay is simple but very nice, you can fly with Thor or Human Torch, swing with Spidey, run over everything with Hulk, take vehicles like cars, boat and planes and everything works nice.Besides the story there areA LOTof side missions, new characters and clothes to unblock, things to do in the city like races and help people and hidden items on the chapters that was impossible to get without the ability to change the character at any time. There are so many things that I completed the storyline and was only 20% of the game.The voice acting is awesome, the sound is ok, but the soundtrack isn't the most remarkable thing you will hear, after a while playing it seems the same track all over again.After all that, I'm sure that if you like the Marvel universe or Lego games or super heroes(who doesn't???)this game has everything for you have fun."

Side quests are more varied than in previous games but some of the same types apply here, fetch/escort/race. Flying controls may be a bit weird to get used to but you should be fine with them eventually.It took me 36 hours to 100% the game with every achievement/collectable and the story itself is about 9-12 hours.LAST POINT, yes you can use a keyboard but I wouldn't expect a great gameplay experience as a controller is recommended. Do not expect online coop either, it's local only which means you're playing solo or getting friends/family to play with you by hooking up some controllers (or using the keyboard/mix of the two).So yes this is definitely the best LEGO game currently out there right now.If you're a LEGO Fan you owe it to yourself to play this, if you love Marvel then you'll enjoy it.

Characters talk and plenty of humor to go around. There is both a story mode and then an open world free to play mode once you complete each section of the story mode. Plenty of characters to play as within the Marvel Universe.

,Recommended,249130,32522635,Posted: 17 June,all,ProfJimbo,"Super Heroes in a huge mostly interactive world, tons of side missions.  Use different powers or similar attributes to solve and complete these side missions which are shown on  a map. Find hidden red bricks, get cheats to make collecting bricks easier for example: 2 times more coins , 4 times more coins, 8 times more coins,  or  attract coins like a magnet.Boss fights had some sort of strategy, usually busting blocks and using whatever could be made with them or uncovering a switch or lever to somehow weaken the bosses.I like most of the missions, but some might be too difficult until a certain vehicle and or character is unlocked, for example: I found the mission starting from the Shield Helicarrier  and flying through rings difficult till I unlocked a jet with good handling. Also, there were some flying missions where I got totally lost because I had to find and memorize where the coin rings were located.Let's hope Lego games evolve and offer not just collect-a-thons but  more varied stages even 2d  or mini-games with arcade flavor. For now, yes online multiplayer might help, but I would not hold my breath."

The characters, the stories, the references; they all shout Marvel. But it's the combination with the LEGO franchise and mechanisms that brings the real fun and jokes!In this game, you will play through 15 levels, each chapter with its designated duo of characters. But once you've finished the level, you can play it again with any character you want, which is needed to find some of the more hidden collectibles. And there is a mass of characters to choose from, each with their own abilities (although most abilities are available to multiple characters.) You will have to collect these characters though before they become playable, and this is where the mainpart of the overworld comes in besides the connection between chapters: This LEGO Marvel version of Manhattan is crowded with side quests, races, hidden objectives, and so much more. Just exploring the overworld alone is a lot of fun.Most achievements you'll get from just playing the game, but there are a few that will make you collect everything possible to collect and search in every nook of Manhattan and the levels. I managed to 100% the game in just a little under 50 hours, and it never was boresome or tiring.And if you need any help, Deadpool's there for you. If you can find him."

The world has a couple of random glitches that come and go. Other than this is, it is a really solid good game."
,Recommended,249130,17225803,"Posted: 25 July, 2015",all,Harley,"The best thing about LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is that it delivers almost everything a Marvel fan could want. From Abomination to the Wizard, this game is an A-to-Z (well, A-to-W) love letter to the Marvel Universe that starts with the Silver Surfer gliding across the title screen and ends with a credits song that could not have been better chosen. A few technical glitches and some carryovers from the franchise history keep it from being an outright masterpiece, but it easily ranks as one of the best superhero games I've played in years.It starts with the characters. Where LEGO Batman 2 offers a sizable roster of heroes and villains, the campaign in LEGO Marvel delivers more playable heroes in a much more coherent story about collecting cosmic bricks around the world before villains do. The first mission starts with Iron Man and Hulk, but the selection of playable characters soon grows to include the rest of the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, loads of X-Men, and even Spider-Man. You'll even switch heroes mid-way through many of the missions, with Cyclops and Jean Grey rescuing Storm and Iceman during an assault on the X-Mansion, or the Human Torch flying in to assist Black Widow and Hawkeye as they infiltrate a Hydra base. The entrances and exits are all handled as part of the story, which gives you a chance to play several characters who all feel like they're part of a single narrative.What's Next-Gen LEGO Marvel Super Heroes Like?The same is true of the villains. You can start by chasing Doctor Octopus from the Baxter Building to the Daily Bugle, but you'll soon be flying off to thwart Dr. Doom's plans in Latveria and taking the Rainbow Bridge to stop Loki from stirring up the frost giants in Asgard. I particularly liked how each mission played out as a sort of protracted chase, with the heroes in pursuit of folks like Magneto or the Red Skull, while battling lots of lesser villains like Pyro or the Leader along the way. As great as it all is, telling such an earth-shattering story without major characters like Dr. Strange or Sub-Mariner present feels off. Still, when a game features lesser-known characters like Black Bolt, Captain Britain and HERBIE, it's hard to complain. Maybe they're saving Kang and Ultron for a sequel?The puzzles in the LEGO games are almost always solved by matching the right power to the right problem, and the Marvel take on this mechanic is particularly inventive. TakeLEGO Marvel Super HeroesLEGO Marvel Super Heroes offers an original storyline in which Nick Fury calls upon heroes spanning the Marvel Universe to save Earth from such threats as the vengeance of Loki and the hunger of Galactus, Devourer of the Worlds.Great Games with Huge CastsSuper Street Fighter IV: Arcade EditionLeague of LegendsLeague of LegendsLeague of LegendsSkylanders Swap Force Black Widow for example. She, like Invisible Woman, can spoof security cameras, but Widow also has the acrobatic skill of Captain America, which enables her to access remote areas of the levels, and the brains of Tony Stark, which lets her use certain consoles that would be off limits to other heroes. Throw in a gun, and you've got a very useful character made up of a number of different power sets. Storm and Thor, for instance, can both use electricity to power up stations, but Thor can smash open walls while Storm can put out fires. Even though there are only maybe a couple dozen powers to share among them all, the various combinations of powers ensures that no one feels entirely redundant.You will get a few power sets that seem a bit out of place; Captain America's ubiquitous shield switches seem a little arbitrary, as does the notion that Wolverine should be really good at digging and climbing. There are also a few that make sense but aren't particularly well implemented. The special sixth sense shared by characters like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Daredevil is really more for recognizing what walls you can climb than for keeping those characters out of danger.I finished the main campaign in under 12 hours, but I've been coming back to collect extra characters and bricks for days after. In between missions, there's a massive open-world map of Manhattan to explore, from the Statue of Liberty and Battery Park to the X-Mansion up past Harlem. There's also the massive SHIELD Helicarrier floating over the East River.The city has loads of attractions, complete with characters to collect and challenges to beat. Over the course of the side missions, you'll help Heimdall take out frost giants on the docks, battle Sentinels in the streets, or take control of a neglectful boyfriend's mind and make him climb the Empire State Building to apologize to his girlfriend.Experienced gamers won't find many of the open-world puzzles and challenges to be much of a contest; for the most part, you'll simply need to identify the type of task you're facing and then just go hit the right steps in the right order. It's clear that the challenges are aimed at LEGO’s young demographic, so gamers craving a challenge will be let down here. Still, if the allure of putting Daredevil on a motorcycle and having him race Ghost Rider through the Upper West Side sounds fun, the difficulty is sort of incidental. The rare exceptions are the timed challenges, or those that require you to search out objectives that aren't in the immediate vicinity of the challenge.The biggest pain is the inconsistent, confusing flight system. It attempts to use the same control scheme from the missions where the up and down motion of the thumbstick moves your character toward or away from the camera. Now you'll use face buttons to control the pitch of your character's flight. The problem is that the button you use to ascend is also the button you use to accelerate, and I frequently found myself flying into the side of buildings or massively overshooting my objective. Even with a week or so of playing, it still seems weird to me.Lego Marvel Super Heroes, Manhattan tourEven with that one chief complaint, there's just so much to love about LEGO Marvel that I've been playing it a few hours a day for over a week now and am still finding new charms. From unlocking Gwen Stacy and making her jump off the Brooklyn Bridge to watching the heroes dance at Tony Stark's house parties, this game is full of the moments that make Marvel one of the best brands in entertainment.THE VERDICTLEGO Marvel Super Heroes is the best thing to happen to Marvel games since 2006's Marvel Ultimate Alliance. It's a warm and witty, multi-layered approach to the brand that ties in hundreds of Marvel's most iconic characters, settings, and stories. While you can knock out the campaign story in around eight hours, the world is rich with content, and I've found myself up late every night for the past week playing for ""just one more hour."" It may not offer the challenge or player-driven context of this year's other open-world games, but those games would be hard-pressed to deliver as much fun and happiness as you'll find. 9.5/10"

This game clearly was meant to push the avengers movies or ride on the little success that movie got. Thowing in random marvel heroes who have nothing to do with the games story is enough to not call this Lego marvel super heroes, rather Lego Avengers.That little segment with the xmen was lacking and that one particular mission that had jean grey in it, which makes no sense. when was the last time you seen jean outside of a xmen story, without other xmen characters around her, or without her phoenix powers.I can't even call wolverine a xmen anymore, since hes on every freaking team. Wolverine the team S%^t is what they call him.All and all this game has good Marvel fan service, not as deep into the marvel universe as i wanted, but enough to please a loyal comic book fan.

Here are my opinions, and you can decide:PROS:-Free-roaming is one of the best aspects of gameplay in LMSH.-The sheer amount of characters included in the game (including people you never see in a Marvel game, like Psylocke or the Guardians of the Galaxy, or Phil Coulson, or Stan Lee himself!).-The team pair-ups in the levels themselves are very pleasantly unorthodox, such as Captain America, the Thing, and Storm teaming up.-The story in LMSH, while drawing elements from the Marvel films, is totally original and manages to connect to the comics fairly well.-The character creator allows you to make some very fun combinations (for example, I gave Thor's hammer to Mary Jane Watson).-There is a huge amount of attention to detail in the design of the levels, the overworld, and the characters in particular.-Every car you see is more than willing to let you just jump in and ""borrow"" it for ""official superhero business.""-Everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) makes bad jokes or puns throughout the game.CONS:-You NEED to play this with a controller. There's not really a good way not to.-There are a lot of small bugs and glitches in the game, such as characters taking too long to switch between, or someone's arms disappearing.-Some of the hitboxes or ranges on the different powers/abilities are not very clear or consistent (i.e., activating a power from right beside an NPC or several feet away from them sometimes doesn't work).-The character creator, while it has A LOT of combinations, is sometimes very goofy in the way that some of the combinations work together. For example, I paired Wolverine with the Human Torch, and the character got all of the shared powers except flight.-If you are not playing with two people, the second player's AI is garbage. Often times they will get stuck in a location, or go off somewhere else just when you need their help.-The levels themselves...just aren't very fun. Numerous times throughout my playthrough I found myself completely confused about what I was supposed to do, particularly during the boss fights. The hint system for the Minikits and overworld locations is sometimes just as bad.-For me, there was not a lot of replayability in LMSH. By the time you unlock all of the characters, you've essentially done everything the game has to do several times over, so even though I had gotten some characters I love playing as, there was nothing left for them to do...besides run around and ""borrow"" taxicabs.While this game is fun, it feels a bit hollow. 7/10"

,Recommended,249130,34513459,Posted: 26 August,all,Whoota,"I bet that when the Disney executives were playing Lego Batman 2 they got cold feet and immediately rang up Travellers Tales to have them make something just like that, but with Marvel characters. Turned out pretty good.Lego Marvel Superheroes is exactly like Lego Batman 2 except that it uses the Marvel Universe instead of DC. Controls are the same, gameplay is identical and everything revolves around golden bricks and character coins. New in the game is the Megafigure, a considerably larger minifigure that gives shape to characters like Hulk and The Thing.Like Lego Batman 2 (you’re going to hear this a lot) the story stays true to the comics and puts a set of heroes into a unique adventure. Loki is up to no good and has recruited a number of villains to his cause. You controls a host of iconic heroes who need to stop his dastardly plans, whatever they may be.Being a newly written story it combines certain heroes in ways you don’t often see them ; mostly due to licensing issues. The detachement from the current marvel cinematic universe allows the combination of Xmen, Fantastic Four, Spiderman and Avengers with no problem at all. The character pool is massive as usual with many characters becoming much sought after very fast to help clear content effectively.The voicework is delivered by the current cartoon casts and overtime by Steve Blum and Nolan North. In fact, the latter is so omnipresent that he is more of a bother than an actual improvement. While it all fleshes out into a cohesive package that will keep you busy for hours on end, it’s not all perfect. Technically, this game is one of the least refined Lego games yet, with shoddy controls, badly executed character missions and a crash here and there.When all is said and done, this is still the best Marvel Game you can get on Steam right now, especially for younger players. Fans however will also find lots to do and enjoy the many references and Easter eggs."

Since then, I've wrecked this game 100%, and now I'm here to talk about it.Here are some of the things that I really liked about Lego Marvel:1. The hub world of NYC is humungo-jumbo sized. It's filled with tons of missions to do and things to unlock. The Lego Star Wars hub areas are like little fluffy cupcakes compared to the sumo-sized birthday cake that is Lego Marvel's NYC hub. It's big and I like big things.2. The character roster. Lego Marvel features 155 playable characters (not including DLC), as well as a big number of custom characters for you to create. They even have lesser-known heroes like Moon Knight and Squirrel Girl. The conclusion: the character roster is GODLIKE.3. The main story and bonus Deadpool missions are good fun.  The story has you playing as different characters all the time, and the villains plotting against you also change constantly. Just like the previous Lego games, the main story has some good content to keep you busy.  I should also mention that co-op play is always available, and that is a MAJOR PLUS.And here are some thing you might not like so much:1. Keep in mind this game is aimed at younger audiences, so expect lots of simple beat'em up gameplay, simple puzzling, and corny dialogue. Some like it, but it isn't for everyone.2. This game can be very glitchy. One time I was replaying the first level and The Sandman turned huge. I was about to spray him with water and DESTROY HIM, but instead of destroying him, he slowly sunk into the ground and glitched out of the map entirely. I had to restart the level in order to continue. I have also encountered bugs where hub world missions wouldn’t show up at times and I've even heard that freezes can be common.  Bug-filled games really wound my soul, so be aware of this before purchasing.At the end of the day, Lego Marvel is a pretty fun game. I recommend it especially to those who are fans of the Marvel universe or the past Lego games, and to the younger audience as well.Overall, if Lego Marvel Super Heroes was a beverage, it would definitely be a tangy, chicken-flavored soda drink with an amusing aftertaste that leaves quite an impression. Thank you for reading."

I really wish that steam had a middle option between thumbs up and thumbs down.It's definatly not bad, and it plays like a lego game, but as far as I've gotten I've noticed quite a few patterns that i didn't see in previous titles that make the game seem rather lazy.  It is definatly a huge game, with quite a few playable characters, but the story levels seem to be lacking.As an example, every boss I've encountered so far has played out the exact same.  You fight a horde of enemies, then you're allowed to his the boss once, then another horde of enemies, then you can hit the boss again, then another horde of enemies and then you hit the boss again and win.  I've gone through quite a few bosses and since every one has played the same, I don't see them changing it up later.  Needless to say it gets rather boring rather quick.The humor also seems to be lacking, and I am comparing this to the lego star wars.  Now I haven't played lego lord of the rings, so I don't know if it also has voice acting, but I feel like the voice acting and actual dialouge has really taken away a lot of the humor.  Each character that talks has a single character trait and tends to just repeat it in differant ways.  Spiderman just won't shut up about all the teen-angst he's having to go through.  I don't think I've sat through a conversation with him where he didn't mention having to do homework.  Again it gets very tired very quickly.  The funniest parts tend to be the deadpool cameos.  Those are done in the old lego game style, through humerous movements and noises.The game is also far too story focused.  There are few games where I'd consider this a bad thing, but this is one of them.There is a bleeding cutscene every 4 minutes, and this game sufferes from one of the worst features in all video games.  Unskippable cutscenes.  That is almost as bad as micro transactions.  People like me don't care about the story of a lego game.  The story is also incredibly redundent.  There are cosmic bricks from the silver surfer's surfboard and Dr. Doom wants them to rule the world.  There that's the plot.  Be prepared to have that drilled into your brain in every single unskippable cutscene.All that being said there is still a really nice charm to playing a lego game.  Playing as the characters and seehing how they're differant to each other is really great fun.  I love being able to swing around New York as Venom (so few games have Venom as a playable character and I don't understand why.  Venom is amazing).  I like being able to go insanely fast as iron man (although, I won't lie, he's an utter pain to control while flying).  That's the main driving point to continue playing; seeing what new character you'll unlock, or working twords unlocking your favorite marvel character.It's a really weird situation writting a review like this, because if you play it the way you're supposed to (the story mode) it's really rather boring, but if you play it just dicking around as the characters you unlock, it's rather great fun.   If you don't get bored easily or you like constantly doing the same thing, go for it.  Otherwise I'd say it's safe to avoid unless you're a massive Marvel fan."

,Recommended,249130,19205384,"Posted: 21 November, 2015",all,flinch1031,"Review time! This time we're discussing LEGO Marvel Superheroes. I'll give you the breakdown of the goods and bads of this game. So lets hop right in.OVERVIEWIf you are familiar with the LEGO games, this one does not differ. LEGO games are one of the few games that are rated E that really are enjoyable to everyone. It doesn't matter how old you are, this game is fun. Like all LEGO games, this game is packed full of puzzles, cheesy one-liners, and a huge range of playable characters.PROSThis game is entertaining through and through. Both the campaign and the side missions are fun to play. The open world is huge and there's around 136 playable characters to collect (You can even be Stan Lee, who has several superpowers) along with a bunch of vehicles. Deadpool is one of the rarest characters in the game and has his own set of missions that need completed in order to unlock. Like all LEGO games, you can play campaign missions over again with any character you would like (and you'll need to do so if you are looking to 100% the game). Achieving 100% is usually the primary goal of the LEGO games, but many people just play whenever they feel like. I have not quite achieved 100% but I do intend to in the future. As far as the Marvel aspect goes, the characters/storyline do not necessarily follow the movies or comics. This does not take away from the experience at all (unless you're one of those weird die-hard comic guys). You can find almost every character thinkable in the Marvel Universe (except for a few, but I can't think of any off the top of my head).CONSThere aren't many cons, but there are definitely some that need noted. LEGO games have NEVER been meant for PC, there are a set of PC controls, but they are awkward, and don't even use the mouse. If you're going to play this game, I HIGHLY recommend using a gamepad. If you don't have a gamepad, don't worry, the game is still playable, the controls are just going to take some getting used to.Another thing about controls, while flying, if you run into the side of a building, you will come to a jolting halt and the camera will be a bit weird in adjusting. As you improve your flying skills, you'll run into this problem (no pun intended) less and less.The other large con is that you cannot kill civilians in the open world, which is a real shame. While there are enemies in the open world, you can only fight them during side missions or while at The Raft (The prison). This is very disappointing, but I heard it might've been required to maintain the game's E rating. Still, a shame.VERDICTThis game is super fun. If you are a Marvel fan, or loved the other LEGO games, or both, then you really need to get this game. Even if you haven't played a LEGO game before, I recommend you give it a try. Pick it up on sale if you can, but I paid full price and have #noregrets.Liked the review? Let me know by hitting the thumbs up button below.

Add the game to your wish list and then forget about it... wait until an e-mail or through random checks to your wish list and grab it when it goes on sale..If you don't like putting 50+ hrs in to get to the 100% game stage and unlock the 115 characters.. then use the 1001 codes to get straight away unlocks..A good all round game that isn't a brain killer in any way (even though you may need to check where certain things are hidden - Stan Lee challenge where the icon is hidden under a larger icon on the map.. so you only see a tiny part sticking out.)"

Full of the traditional cartoonish hyjinks and hours of gameplay for those of you who strive to see ""100%.""  I've been very pleased with how the LEGO games improve over the years, and this is no exception.  My only (very minor issue) is that even though the game offers full controller support (hype!), the support doesn't seem very ""full.""  Yes, my controller works perfectly fine and the controls are the exact same as any other LEGO console game (huge plus to these LEGO games); however, it will read ""Button 12"" or whichever button on the screen instead of ""A"" or ""X"".  As much as I've tried to fix it, I've found no solution.  As I have the majority of the LEGO games on console, this is a very minor issue since I am already accustomed to the controller layout.  Overall, this game is well worth the purchase and is one of the better casual co-op games out there."

,Recommended,249130,19196852,"Posted: 21 November, 2015",all,Rocketman Max,"LEGO Marvel Super Heroes follows the general trend that LEGO games usually take - easy, but sometimes unforgettable. I believe it is evident now that every LEGO game is pretty much identical. This game takes a LOT of Marvel characters and mashes them into a relatively straight forward story. It is better than LEGO Marvel's Avengers, mostly because the dialogue is much better. Graphics wise it looks relatively cute, but the open world cities are not especially great looking. The locations vary throughout the missions, from Asgard to the X-Mansion. Unfortunately as with any LEGO game, they are amazing initially but ultimately grow really repetitive and downright boring. Because the game is relatively easy there is an almost apparent feeling that there is no challenge, and I didn't find it too fun after a while and certainly wanted it to end. Gameplay is the same as any other LEGO game. I wish they'd make a standalone LEGO Spider-Man game, it would be pretty damn good. Couch co-op is definitely an option. You can play keyboard (player 1) and controller (player 2) and it does work! Sometimes co-op is much more convenient to solve puzzles than to do puzzles by yourself. Controls are customizable thankfully so it isn't a pain. The most fun characters tend to be the big guys, like Abomination, Hulk and The Thing, since they are mobile and can hit a lot of things.Is the PC version good, though? Well, yes. And, kinda. With a spice of no. It barely has any options to tweak graphical settings, and it has some weird problems. I can play it at 720p at about 400fps but then you switch it to 1080p and things mess up. For some reason, during some cutscenes, the game drops in frames. It certainly is not game breaking, but you will notice it and it is really weird. (I am running a GTX 960 2gb, Intel Core i5 4590, 8gb RAM.)The story is pretty decent, the game is fun while it lasts and there certainly is a lot of content to be discovered.I don't regret buying this at £3.74, but if you have played A LOT of LEGO games and are getting sick of them, I don't recommend this game to you with a full heart, and therefore you should get it on a sale, because you will be much more forgiving on yourself."

There are many air vehicles also. Each character has their own ability and specials they do to people while they're fighting. I hope LEGO® The Hobbit™ will be a lot like this game, in Middle Earth... no cars and stuff... Instead, horses! Anyway, I really like this game, I knew it would be fun, everyone's been talking about it, but it was more fun than I expected! It is worth buying. :) The Asgard character pack is awesome, but I wish Sif could throw her sword, like Gamora. Maybe her symbol on what she's going to throw it at could be the same as Thor's, the Asgard symbol, but silver and without lightning. :) I wish there was a DLC for a few other characters, Loki with his black outfit and his other outfit but without the helmet, and Deadpool normal clothes.

Simple puzzles are tossed in to present a little challenge (although few would be considered tough). The storyline keeps the player moving through the levels, with Free Play offering even greater depth of play throughout. True to Lego & TT's past writing, you will find quite a few chuckles along the way.Pros- LOTS of characters, including Big Figs- Lots of vehicles- Quality voice acting (check the IMDB cast)- Plenty of things to do, places to go, objects to SMASHCons (mostly minor)- Hero flight controls - BLAH! You really should have avoided double up (dash) and double down (stop), as it makes trimming a pain- Some pathing issues, resulting in what should be avoidable deaths. Also a couple of PC crashes while playing- Auto, Boat, and Air vehicle spawns could have been different logos. I've seen many reports of players not getting 100%, until they remember the dock or air spawns needed to purchase remaining unlocked items* DLC doesn't seem to have much value (unless you really want those few characters)...also, is it just me, or do the writers not like Jean Grey (e.g. use her powers to push chairs back under a dining table?!)"

Usually because each new Lego game were trying new game mechanics and they didn't quite get them right the first time; in the next Lego game it would be perfected, but then they were trying something new again that didn't quite work, so there was always something wrong. And depending on the universe of the Lego game, sometimes there just weren't enough characters to make it feel varied and interesting (Indiana Jones was particularly bad about this).This is the first Lego game that has felt completed and polished. I have no criticisms whatsoever. All the game mechanics work, they're not overly complicated to use, and there's so much variation in the characters' abilities that you really do want to play through with all of them. The game world is also large enough that you want to explore it all, AND you have character abilities that let you do so without wasting time walking.

He wasn't kidding! It's packed full of tidbits and Easter Eggs, nods both heavy-handed and subtle.Same basic gameplay you get in every Lego game - if you've played any before, there's very little new offered here. The hub world is a mini Manhatten, and it's impressively sized. Hundreds of side quests, races, hidden gold bricks, and characters are dotted around, and hunting them out can be quite the challenge! There's an impressive array of heroes, mutants, monsters etc. available, though apart from Iron Man very few people get even one alternative version - mostly just palette-swaps, although in some cases (Iron Man, Green Goblin and Jean Grey are the foremost) the alternative can be radically different. There are also vehicles available to collect and buy in a similar fashion, although since you unlock Iron Man as the very first character, as soon as you're free to explore the hub world you can fly anyway, so vehicles feel a little superfluous except for some of the racing side-quests.Levels are linear, and for the most part quite simple - though there is the occasional part that may leave you completely stumped! These games are aimed at a generally younger audience, so don't assume there'll be a great deal of challenge. There is a nice variety of challenges though, even if quick-time button-mashing gets a little stale.Overall, a bright and witty package that, while not difficult, still has enough content to entertain most people for some time. I've 100%ed it in just under 50 hours, which is a fair amount of playtime. One for fans of Marvel, or younger gamers."

,Recommended,249130,9880186,"Posted: 20 April, 2014",all,soliunasm,"What an absolutely wonderful game. For anyone who has ever played the Lego games before, this is a giant step up, particularly if you haven't played since the early games like I have.  They added voice acting, open world, more detail, just everything.The amount of characters you can unlock is staggering, and they even group characters that are the same. So the variants of Iron Man are all in one rotating selection rather than separate characters themselves to pad out the character list that's already enormous. The open world of New York is amazingly fun to go through, and the game gives you many ways to go about it. The voice acting is top notch, they even managed to get Clark Gregg to reprise his role as Coulson, although having James Arnold Taylor as Spiderman was a bit offputting at first, kept seeing Ratchet instead of Spiderman.New York has many side-quests for you to do to unlock new characters, vehicles, and Gold Bricks, many of which require you to get new powers to obtain them so you can't get them all in one go. The streets are littered with attention, constant amounts of Studs placed around for you to pick up, with each area having completely different patterns and placements so no two buildings are the same. Really appreciate the time the folks who placed those put into it. You can hijack cars, although they're much slower than any form of transportation you already have, and drive into other cars, drive like a maniac, etc. But since it's a Lego game the characters don't break apart, they mainly just fall down and yell at you to watch where you're going.Side-quests by themselves are pretty standard, either you go pick something up, fight a wave of enemies, escort someone through the open streets, or race someone. The best part of them is honestly the starting and ending comments the characters make, and that makes up for the monotony of the whole thing.The writing is great, tons of jokes for kids, tons of jokes for comic fans, tons of jokes for adults, tons of everything for everyone to enjoy. The writing is also really aided by the silly things characters do in the background, like The Hulk sweeping things, or Coulson making jumps to save things Fury threw away, etc. SDeadpool can get to be pretty annoying, but I understand that's his entire thing, so I can deal with it, while Spiderman can be annoying at the start but ends up being enjoyable. Iron Man/Tony Stark is by far my favorite character along with The Thing, they both were great.The story levels are very enjoyable from a writing standpoint. It's really nice to hear the silly banter between characters and see them in the cutscenes. The levels feel alright, they're basically just ""Find a way to get this guy over here so you can get him to open something up for the other guy to open up"" over and over without much change throughout the entire game.Regarding gameplay, the fighting is the same as it always has been, mashing X to win, although the bosses seem to be way draw out this time. All bosses amount to spending ages waiting to hit them for one damage on their 3-6 heart health bar and then they fly away for a while and taunt you while sending a bunch of mooks your way. There's really no penalty at all for dying, you basically just lose 1,000 Studs which is absolutely nothing even from the start, and there's Extras to increase your four hearts to five as well. The actual use of the characters is fantastic though, any characters with flight, particularly Iron Man, are a joy to use pretty much anywhere and especially in the overworld. You get to go super fast and doing things like falling to the ground and boosting straight through the street never gets old.Now, the game does have its own share of problems. The draw distance is very poor, you will see stuff in terribly low resolutions on anything pretty much two buildings away even on high. The top of the Empire State Building has its spire and the ""fins""(Pardon me, don't know the exact name of those things) in some horribly low quality even when you're standing right next to it. In certain Free Play levels(5 for me) you can get stuck in elevators during area transitions, so you can't progress anymore because one character gets stuck in an infinite death loop and you can't switch or get them out in any way. Save and Quit sometimes fixes it, but not guaranteed. Help messages are a constant if you put subtitles on. They will never go away, they will always show up, even when you've beaten the game unless you turn off the subtitles. Getting stuck in items is very common, I would get stuck in boxes, walls, or sink into the floor at times which would require to either switch to another character and then wait a few seconds for the AI to teleport to me, or save and quit to fix it. The driving is completely awful, you turn so sharply that it's hard to control things and get caught up on the slightest of ledges in certain vehicles which makes the racing missing just that much harder. The AI pathing is awful. If you don't give the character an Iron Man(Or sometimes, even when you do) they will end up running into a corner for eternity because they can't get out. This is especially bad when they're Spiderman-type characters because they will get in a ""Jump on wall --> Fall down --> Run at wall --> Repeat"" pattern.All in all, this is a wonderful game. It's extremely charming, appeals to pretty much everyone, and even though it's quite easy and repetitive it knows how to hit all the sweet spots, whether you're a comic book fan or not. You also owe it to yourself to try out Iron Man at least once, flying as him is amazing and done perfectly."

This means that the WHOLE 50 hours consists of me finding/doing something new, and generally having fun.Okay, so 4 out of 50 hours consisted of me and a few friends screwing around and causing chaos, but that's STILL more fun than going through the same Star Wars level 2 more times in repetitive ""Challenge"" and ""Super Story"" time trials, wherein you encounter nothing new. Fortunately, this game does NOT have these modes.Onto the game itself, it's standard LEGO platforming goodness. If you came here expecting something new and wildly different, you're out of luck.However, if you're a fan of adventurous, exploration-heavy platformers like Spyro the Dragon and Ratchet and Clank, you can't go wrong with this. The story's quite entertaining, and the characters are likeable. It's really on the easy side, but that just means you won't tear your hair out in frustration most of the time.Just watch out for the bugs, though. It's not as stable as LEGO Star Wars, and you might get stuck in due to an elevator door closing in on one of your characters, or just being unable to tag/switch to the other active character until heading to a new area.Also, turn off Vsync when using an LED monitor, or else you'll crash at scene changes.8/10"

I wish there had been more of the voice actors from the movies, but the replacements do a reasonable job.  In addition to the main story line of missions, it has a bunch of additional shorter missions that are unlocked through the collection of gold bricks.  A much better reason for collecting gold bricks than in previous games.  Also, taking a page from the Lego Harry Potter ""Student In Peril"" mechanic, the game has 50 ""Stan Lee in Peril"".  Hearing the father of Marvel comics uttering his classic ""Excelsior!"" or other amusing breaking-the-fourth-wall quips never gets old.  Speaking of breaking the fourth wall: Deadpool.  He's in it alot.  I'm pretty sure I spotted him in every single stage, ""Where's Waldo"" style.  He also has plenty of amusing dialogues.  The only other character I have to mention is Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson.  It starts out cool to hear his now iconic voice, but since he bascially acts as the in-game help system that can't be turned off, it quickly gets annoying.  I'm almost at 100% and he's still telling me basic mechanics like ""big figures can pull green handles"".  Why they couldn't just add an option to turn off help in the menu is beyond me.  The game has an incredibly full roster with 150 characters and I was very surprised at the number of variations of combat moves in the group.  My only real disappointment was the lack of several popular characters like Quicksilver, Scarlett Witch, Namor and others, while they included less popular (and boring) characters like Kurse, Absorbing Man and Beetle.  I don't know what the thinking there was.  But overall I think this is a great game, tons of fun, and a must play for Lego and Marvel fans alike."

There are a ton of chartacters and each one has a unique power based on their comic book counterpart. There is also alot of slots for creating custom characters. The voice acting is good for the mpst part but some are not ideal for that particular character. However, some of the characters are actually voiced by their movie actor like Clark Gregg, who plays Agent Coulson in the movies and TV show.One thing I really enjoy is the free-roam. When not playing the story, there is a huge free-roam area. In this area, you can destroy things, drive cars, do small missions, etc. I grew up playing LEGO Star Wars, which doesn't have a large area to roam. Especially in The Complete Saga. It was just the Cantina. So from playing that game, to now playing this one, there is a huge and positive difference.The only thing I would say got me was the actual levels themselves. They are extremely repetative, unlike other LEGO games where the game goes along with the story from the moives. This game has a made up story so even though the background and enemies are different each time, the style for each one is similar.But other than that again, I highly recommend this one if you're looking for a LEGO game that takes a while to get to 100%!"
,Recommended,249130,14270240,"Posted: 31 January, 2015",all,Eeuwit,"Lego Marvel Super Heroes is a great Lego game that holds hours of content.>Story:The game has his own story that is not based on any of the Marvel Universe movies or comics. Because it is not based on any movie or comic you will find a lot of heroes combining in diffirent teams which you have to use to solve puzzles and fight through heaps of enemies and super villains.The puzzles are well made and integrated into the story. Some puzzles might be a bit too hard for children, because the solution is not always showed immediatly. These harder puzzles do make it more entertaining for teenagers and mature people.>Gameplay:The Gameplay is nice and smooth, you don't need to have a very expensive PC to have nice graphics and good performance. One of the bad, yet importent thing in the gameplay is the fighting. Each hero or villain has his own special auto attacks that he or she will use from time to time.The auto moves are often not fluently when you are fighting and you down with what you are doing. In my opinion the moves look great, but they should take less time to finish or way to snap out of it since it can get frustrating when you are fighting a boss and there are a lot of enemies to kill.Besides this the game is great! The game features a great open world based on New York City that you can explore, discover, collect and help people in. In this open world there are story mission implemented. Aswell as in the story missions and the open world you can collect gold bricks which unlock the special missions of Deadpool. All these things will make sure that you are at least 30-40 hours busy to just get all levels and then there is still not everything in the game done.Another great feature of this game is that it supports nearly every controler. I plugged in my PS3 and PS4 controller and they both work with the game. The keyboard controls are not very friendly to use. Especially when you are playing with a friend so the ability to plug in two controllers and go is just great.>Characters:One thing I liked a lot about this game is that it features nearly every character in the Marvel Universe. Since this is a thing the movie world has problems with I found it great to play with aswell Iron Man and Wolverine. The game is also made in a way where diffirent characters need to use their abilities to help their team mates. It is impossible to do one level with just 1 character.>Final Verdict:The game is great and gives you more than enough content to play with for the price you are buying it for.  I recommend this game to everyone that likes Lego, Marvel or just puzzle games in general. I am still having a great experience with this game and I love the controller support which makes it so easy to play with my friend.9.5 / 10"
,Recommended,249130,10185077,"Posted: 20 May, 2014",all,arbor day,"I'm gonna try something different and start this off with all the problems I have with this game.THERE IS NO SHUMA-GORATH.At its heart, this is a childrens game. That means there are going to be hint messages popping up nonstop. They will quickly get annoying, telling you things you have already proven through gameplay that you know how to do. There's no option to shut these off, and besides cluttering up the screen nonstop, this ruins a lot of moments that you might have to think for a few seconds over which character you should be using for something.Another thing you can't skip are the cut scenes. Even when you go back and replay a level in free play mode (as required in these games if you want to get completion) you will have to sit through the majority of the cut scenes. Rarely, it will let you skip one here and there while the rest offer no such option. I'm guessing this has to do with the cut scene in question being an in game cut scene, which many are, or an actual video that gets played.There is no online multiplayer. How the hell is this a thing developers still leave out? Not only does including drop in / drop out multiplay make your game more fun, but it means I will be playing it much more once I complete everything.The fighting mechanics really need some work. Characters automatically lock on to other characters, which means it is not uncommon to be trying to break an object while your hero constantly punches a harmless npc to death. This is sloppy on the development side, and really doesn't go with the whole ""hero"" thing they are trying to do with this game.The flying controls are also pretty bad. They will not so much block your progress as annoy you here and there. Flying close to the ground can result in landing when you had no intention to do so, and pitching up or down can be cumbersome and lead to you overshooting your desired position.The developer seems to have no interest in patching any of the issues people have with the game.You'll notice I still recommended the game. That's because it's a great entry to the LEGO series. Granted, I've missed a couple releases (I'll talk about why in a bit), but this changes a lot of the older design choices that were present in the first few titles. There's a real hub now, instead of just a room with doors that lead to various levels. You can run (fly, stomp, drive, whatever) around New York city, doing little sidequests for various NPCs, unlocking vehicles, or collecting studs. You can also return to the shield Helicarrier for other things to do, although it's much smaller in area than the hub is. The hub map can be used to replay levels, so you don't have to run back to the levels location.There are an amazing amount of playable characters here. You'll most likely run into characters that you will have to look up on wikipedia, as you may have never seen some of the more obscure ones. Howard The Duck even shows up. Sadly, some favorites are missing from the roster. No Shuma-Gorath? Really? Come on, LEGO. You did the tendrils on Venom and Carnage, why couldn't you have done Shuma's tentacles?  Still, Carnage is a nice addition that I wasn't really expecting. I thought they would have focused more on the characters that the general public was aware of from the movies.If you hadn't played a title in this series for a few years, as was my case, one of the first things you will notice is that the characters have voices now. I'm still not really sure how I feel about this. As far as I know, this started with Lord of the Rings. It's the reason I passed on picking up that title. While they aren't badly done, and allow deeper story telling, I feel the voices take away from some of the charm and silliness that the older silent figures.There's a lot to do here, and the hidden levels are interesting enough to want to seek out. The LEGO series has been around long enough that you probably know if these are your kind of thing or not. If they are, this is one of the better ones and worth picking up. If not, you may want to wait for a sale. This title goes on sale for five dollars on Humble Bundle and some other sites, so don't pay the full 20 dollar price tag here if you aren't dying for some LEGO fix."

If theres a Marvel character you want to play as theres a very good chance that they are in this game.  The game also covers a good amount of recognizable marvel locations that also gives a good variety in the playable levels.The game isn't very long if you just play the main story missions.  However there is a a lot of side content that adds some length to the game, though one downside to that content, it is recycled a fair bit.  You can only battle 'X' amount of guys, race against a character or fetch someone/something before it gets a little repetitive.There is a couple of annoying bugs here and there if you are going for the 100%. Things like character tokens appearing but no mission showing (you can get the character just have to wait for the mission to show up, a little frustrating).  Sometimes some prompts won't show up and have to do some manual targetting.  But other than that never ran into anything game breaking.The game goes on sale frequently, so I suggest pick it up on a sale and enjoy."

I am a huge Marvel comics fan, and being able to play as my favorite heroes and villans (together!) is a blast. The main story is kind of short in my opinion, but that doesn't mean the game gets boring. I am maybe close to half way through, and new missions keep popping up. It is really fun trying to unlock all the characters in the game (which is a lot), along with alternate costumes. I can't really compare this to other Lego titles, since I haven't really played any others, but I still think this is a solid game. Some things (like leaving the helicarrier and cruising around New York City on your own) aren't really obvious at first, but overall if you just play around and keep exploring, you will figure it out and have a great time. Definately check this game out if you are a fan of Marvel comics and Lego games."

The story is exciting and different. A usual good vs evil conflict with classic characters ending with some awesome plot twists. Through the whole story which took me about 8 hours to complete you don't see the same level repeting itself. The different locations you go to always keep it exciting, but the one flaw I have about the story is the lack of characters used in it. You play as majoy heroes and fight major villians, but never the less known characters. Deadpool likes to hide around the levels which was dissapointing because he would have added some great lines, which you get to see at the end. In the game you get to explore an open city with notable cities like Stark Tower, X-Men Manor, Avengers Mansion, Baxtor Building and many more. Even better is that there are hours of side quests to unlock new characters and vehicles. They don't take to long either so it can be fun for a short session. The characters you can unlock are amazing, big characters like the Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man and Carnage to small unknown characters like Squirrel Girl and AIM Henchmen. Hours upon hours can go into this game without it feeling like you're doing the same thing over and over. Only two complaints I had throughout the game is the lack of characters in the story, and lack of DLC. The DLC contained big characters like Thanos but LEGO for some reason doesn't like DLC on PC. Other then that, best LEGO game ever, and best Marvel game in a long long time. 9.5/10"
,Recommended,249130,10306540,"Posted: 31 May, 2014",all,Beta Ray Teslamancer,"Lego Marvel SuperHeroes is one of the best Lego game to date, if not the best. As of yet, I have not played The Lego Movie game (have seen an LP of it) and would still say that is the best one since Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga. For Lego Star Wars TCS, all ports to other platforms were just great! I have demoed the 3DS port, played the Xbox One version, and demoed the Wii U version. All ports look just as fantastic as the PC port, and they all have smooth controls. I will say that there are two problems:1: A ton of characters to unlock. This does mean that the options are very wide, but you'll find yourself switching between Iron Man (Heartbreaker), Nova or Thor,  Galactus, Jean Grey/Phoenix, Spodirmun/Spodermun(FF)/Venom, Wolverine, Mr. Fantastic, and some random big figure a bunch. Another problem is all the useless characters. I hardly used any of the sword characters or the ones without some type of beam attack.2: This game is too darn long. This means that there are a ton of Gold Bricks to get, 250 in fact, 140 minikits, and over 120 characters with one of the cheaper DLCs. It also means that there's not a ton of replayability unless you get together with a friend.However, the DLC is quite cheap for a game of this length, and I will hopefully be getting together with my friend sometime soon and playing this. In the words of my other friend Justin, ""It's a fun [play].""Another reason to play this game is that it converges ALL of the Marvel Universes. Some FF and Ultimate characters make their appearances. Other notable characters include BETA RAY BILL one of my all time favorite characters (DLC), Mandarin from the film, Agent Coulson, and Nova (I hope he's in the Guardians of the Galaxy movie).You will notice that Agent Coulson actually is played by his  actor, and Stan Lee makes MANY MANY appearances and is reallyvoiced by the great comic giant himself. Excelsior!Rating: Ten points on the Teslamancer Rating Scale. This game earned the Blue Hood of Teslamancy for Awesomeness."

Although addicting, it includes a very small amount of grinding for the ability to purchase various Extras to unlock. The game runs very well on my system, albeit with the occasional framedrop to around the 40-45ish range; any other time, it's sailing at 60FPS.The challenges aren't too challening, the dialogue is usually quite funny, the camera works well, the characters are well represented in their plastic form.Maybe it's because of how I was introduced to LEGO games (which was LEGO Star Wars on Xbox), but I find it plays a lot better with a controller than it does with keyboard and mouse. If you have one, use it, and if you don't, you should seriously consider getting one.The bottom line, however, is that LEGO Marvel Superheroes, no matter how good or bad you or I think it is, can be thought of as a marketing ploy by LEGO. And there seems to be some truth to this, because LEGO does sell Marvel-themed sets. But, damn it, when a marketing ploy is this much fun to play and involves both toys and characters I love, I don't care whether or not it's trying to get me to buy it, because I just may.Casual, fun, occasionally challenging, quirky and cute game for anybody who wants a good time without sinking hours into something more challenging. 9/10."

Other Lego games follow the story lines of films and usually make fun of little bits here and there or change something in the cinematics to make it more humorous; however, in my own opinion, due to the nature of an original story line, this game lacks the ability to find those little spots to insert comedy.  While the game kind of brags about the huge hero selection, many of them have the same or similar abilites anyways and many are different versions of the same hero.

I had opened the game, and jumped straight into a level, presuming this was similar to one of their earlier titles, LEGO Star Wars which was mostly just pick a mission and get started. Oh, but this was not that. After I had finished the mission, the game rather quickly decided to show me that this game was nothing short from a sandbox game where you could play your favourite super hero and run, or fly around the city, doing missions and beating up bad guys and whatever else the citizens needed your help with.The sandbox element was a great implementation, and certainly increases the lifespan of this game, along with all the collectibles you can get and all the super heroes you can unlock. Which, brings me onto my next point.This is a pretty big game, and it's no secret that it will be much more fun with freinds or family, of all ages I should add. The game isn't too hard to get a handle on, there's no gore, no obscene situations that could get you in trouble, and whether you're 8 or 80, you can enjoy this game. The younger audience will be a fan of the fun, enjoyable combat, the cool super heroes and even the humour, and so will anybody else, along with some more adult-esque jokes that won't necessarily be understood by the younger lot, but it won't stop anybody else having a nice little chuckle.Overall, this is a great LEGO game, and a great game in general for that matter. Loads of content, suitable for pretty much all ages, and an all around good, fun time."

,Recommended,249130,9461556,"Posted: 13 March, 2014",all,Revan1207,"LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is pretty much what it sounds like- a Lego game with Marvel super heroes. Following in the footsteps of LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, it is the second Lego game in recent years to be open world, in this case in New York City. The city is pretty big if you're just walking around but if you're flying around as Iron Man or another character, it doesn't take too long to get from one side of the city to the other. If you want to explore something other than New York City, the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier is up in the air as well.As far as the story goes, it feels like a Marvel story mixed in with the humor you expect from Lego games. I'm only a few missions into the game but the story so far isn't too bad.The game plays pretty well, although I have heard some complaints about the keyboard layout which you can change if you don't like it. The way you control the camera is a bit weird because movement is mapped to WASD and the camera is mapped to PL:"", and there is no way to use the mouse to control the camera. I don't really mind this that much but it is still a minor nuisance. Some characters have special movement abilities like flight. Others like Spider-Man and Venom can web-swing. The web-swinging can look weird sometimes because the webs don't actually connect to buildings. You can be above all of the buildings up high in the air and still be able to web-swing. Again, I don't mind it that much but it looks pretty strange and unrealistic.If there's one thing I'm really happy about with this game it's the amount of playable characters. I'm pretty sure theres over 100 of them, possibly 150, some with a few different costumes. You unlock these characters either by earning them by completing levels or buying them with studs. There are also several vehicles to unlock.The game looks great. The graphics are great, the character's costumes look great, and each character has their own unique animations that look awesome.The soundtrack is really good as well.That's pretty much it. This is one of the best, if not the best, Marvel super-hero games I've ever played and is one of the best ones ever made. The last Marvel super hero game like this I played was Ultimate Alliance (the first and second) which I absolutely loved, and this beats them by a landslide. If you're a Lego fan, a Marvel fan, or a super hero/comic book fan, I highly reccomend this game. 9.5/10"

The Marvel Super Heroes game adds a wealth of additional side missions and independent levels that perviously not found in the Lego game titles (Lego LOTR had some side quests, but they were monotonous and often tedious). In addition to increased content, this game also adds a charming level of character specific fight moves.

One of the best LEGO games I've ever played. In fact, this is one of the best Marvel games I've ever played! It kinda made me explore the Marvel universe a whole lot better. As a teenager, it made me remember the nostalgic experiences building LEGO bricks and reading Marvel comic books when I was a kid. This game is definitely a throwback to some of my favorite characters in the industry, like Spider-Man, Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy's Star-Lord.You can choose from lots of characters, with heroes like Spider-Man, Iron Man and Captain America, and villains like Doctor Doom, Magneto and Venom! Really liked the open-world as you can explore Manhattan awesomely. Liked the main missions (especially Deadpool's side missions). Liked the DLC also. It's super worth the time waited, consumed and remembered through this game!What I don't like about this game though are the glitches. Not only me but a lot of players have also experienced these glitches. I hope TT Games or LEGO can patch / fix this. This will indeed be a classic if they patch / fix the glitches.To sum it all up, if you really like LEGO, if you really like superheroes, and if you really like Marvel, play this game.

76561198070462792,Recommended,249130,13916562,"Posted: 9 January, 2015",all,LevelRaze,"One of my favorite games since joining Steam, Lego Marvel Super Heros is one of the best lego games in terms of both, story, free play, and its overall design. That is not to say though, that it doesn't have its fair share of problems like every lego game does. While these problems do hinder the gamepaly a bit, they can be overcome with some simple adjustments that I will mention in an upcoming guide. But moving on from that, the story is both based upon the movie franchises continuety and its own, givign the impression that it could be a branch off from said films. It also does something that the films either cannot, or have yet to do, and that is bring in (almost) all of Marvels heros and villains together and no Sony, Fox, or Paramount to stop them from doing so. With that being said, the game mechanics are nice and simple, characters have a unique range of abilities and can speak very truely of their original comic book counterparts. But playing with a friend in two player mode can be a bit tricky if your using an xbox controller and they a keyboard or vice-versa, as whatever keys you've binded to your personal liking will sometimes reset themselves to their default state. A minor nitpick but one that can be fixed by buying another conrtoller or using the default keys. Now as for free play, I will say that there isn't much vaule in it, not like with older lego games such as Star Wars: The Complete Saga and Indian Jones: The Original Adventures, and I feel that this takes away some of the free roaming aspect that I expect in lego games, but at the same time, gives us something new and unique to see. With all that being said, I highly recommend this game to those who are both a fan of Marvel, Lego, and enjoy these games growing up on the Gameboy or who have little ones who've taken an intrest in video games. Despite crashing at times, a few bugs (or should I say ants) and some missing peices, this is a really great game."
,Recommended,249130,10159400,"Posted: 18 May, 2014",all,BananaInspector,"4/5 - More fun than you're probably expectingOk it's Lego, however don't be fooled, this isn't just for kids, really good writing and the occasional dodgy reference from deadpool mean that I enjoyed this title maybe more than if I were 12 again. So much effort has been put into Lego games as of late that they're really worth checking out, and this may be the best one yet.It's an open world manhattan island, in which you can run around as almost anyone you want from the marvel universe, whether you're swinging between tall buildings as spiderman, smashing cars as juggernaut and or recreating your favourite moments on sheild's sky carrier as nick fury, it's all a blast. Obviously it's not as gritty as other sandbox games like GTA, but you can steal cars, even though you feel pretty silly doing it when many characters can fly.The gameplay is half action half puzzle, so boss fights are rarely about who can punch who the hardest and much more about how can you leverage the environment to best your foes. It leans hevaily on the Lego dynamic, requiring you in many cases to build solutions to your problems from the rubble caused by the fights themselves, all the while battling increasing numbers of super powered minions to boot. This does get in the way once or twice as boss characters were left standing in the middle of the map, completely invulnerable while I ran around looking for stuff to build. However, once I got into the puzzle frame of mind, these things didn't stand out as much. It's not dark souls after all; once I stopped waiting to backstab the red skull while he was reloading things moved on a little quicker.Levels are well thought out on the whole with puzzles that require you to switch characters and work as a team; often one character will need to open the way up for the others who can't traverse a particular section yet. Sometimes this feels a little contrived as there are switches which only be opened by Captain America's sheild or Wolverine's claws; probably not the best feature to have inside your evil lair is it Dr Doom? However the game is varied and fast paced enough to keep this from breaking up the flow too much.The main draw here is the attention to detail that's been put into creating the Marvel universe, each of the characters make jokes and references to their joint past, especially as shown in the recent films, and it gives a real sense of continuity to the storyline. While it builds on the recent movies, the story itself is completely new. It ties together a vast array of charcters, tying them together in interesting, if not always surprising ways. I think this was pulled off better than in Arkham city, which felt more like a parade of characters, whereas LMSH has the usual suspects joining forces and advancing the plot a little more seamlessly.If you're a fan of Marvel give it a bash, the jokes are actually pretty good and the amount of Marvel-y stuff to do will definately keep you entertained. It's not gritty or particularly deep but blasting your way around the New York skyline as your favourite superhero actually doesn't get tiring too quickly."

The lore is rich and the open world elements make the game outstanding, also the next-gen graphics make it look straight out of the Unity engines cupboard. The story is about a teenager named Chad, who discovers on a week of mountain biking and parachuting that he has super mutant powers, the first power he gets is the ability to score sweet hatricks while playing football on the beach. The second power he gets is the ability to change into Elvis whenever he wants. I've saved the last for the best, his last power is the ability to turn into a biscuit when ever he so pleases. As it says in the game description it was highly inspired by Bad Rats, most of it is like Bad Rats, basically a upgraded version of Bad Rats.STORYThe story revolves around Chad and his gang of extreme skateboarders. He lives in Canada and there is a very big skateboarding competition coming up and Chad is feeling insecure because his Girlfriend dumped him. Then, Chad requires his powers and fights all the evil crime in Canada, he doens't have to use his powers that much. Alot of childhood character make a appearence what can bring nostalgia into your brain, such characters as Johnny Neutron, and Ben 10. Like I said, the lore is awesome, when you come across a a landmark, you'll get a snippit of lore to find out about the certain object/landmark. My favourite was the bodybuildingorange because it supplied with lore that was not known to me, and it made my day. For the story I'd say it makes the game, but I've still got Gameplay to do, and other stuff, but the story is spectacular and I spent countless hours washing my body in it.GAMEPLAYLego Marvel Superheroes takes a change from the other lego games, adding in a XP system with a leveling up system, at first you begin at the NOVICE stage with very little perks, but as Chad progresses he levels up unlocking powerful abilities to defeat evil people, in his quest to become popular and win the Skateboard contest. The combat is amazing, including bloody finishers and great visual stunning takedowns (Non-Lethal and Lethal). One of the characters called Spider-Man can do a sick flip and snap someones neck, what personally I think is quite cool, plus it looks cool in awesome but blocky graphics. But, that's another section, for gameplay I'd say it's fantastic, good combat, good mechanics, and good takedowns?GRAPHICSThe graphics are visuallly stunning as I mentioned, everything has a reflection, when I say everything I MEAN EVERYTHING it's like the floor of a bathroom toilet on every model, seriously it is. But anywho, the graphics are nice and saturated and colourful and really bring in the life to this game, this game in black and white wouldn't be as fun. It was obviously made on the Unity engine, making it stunning graphics and really demostrating what the Unity engine can do when you put lego blocks and make a game with them, cool.FinalAfter countless years, and days of binge playing this game, I think I can settle on a verdict of 6/10 because although the game is truly groundbreaking and breathtaking at everything else, I think the game would've been better if they included more rare pepes."

76561198162961688,Recommended,249130,26109295,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,Iraqi Food Cart,"I got super hyped for this game when was announced, and I first got it on the X-Box 360. I was a big fan of Marvel and I still am now. But I didn't make much progress and eventually, I played it less and less and forgot about it. Recently, I thought about picking the game back up, but I couldn't find it. Fortunately, I noticed that this game was on Steam, and I bought it with both the DLC'S, and I got 100% in 8 days.Plot... (I'm trying to remember the story, so I might not get everything correct)The story of the game is that Dr. Doom captures the Silver Surfer and wants to use pieces his broken board to build his Doom Ray of Doom. Unfortunately for him, the pieces are scattered across NYC. Many different supervillains are on Doom's side as they try to collect the pieces, but SHIELD and its heroes are trying to stop him. In the end, Loki turns on Doom and uses mind control to make Galactus devour Earth. He is quickly stopped by a large group of superheroes (and villains) as Loki and Galactus are sent through a portal to deep space.Pros...The Lego games have a distinct style of gameplay. You play a level the first time only as specific characters, but replaying the levels as anyone can help you find secrets. This is because some areas can only be accessible as certain types of characters, which might not be in the level the first time. I kind of like this, as it has more replay value to it. The graphics are also nice and it is cool seeing famous Marvel icons in Lego form. The vast selection of playable heroes and villains makes a Marvel fan like me very happy. In the other Lego games, nobody talks. This is because in something like Lego Star Wars, the plot of the game is the same as the movies. However, in this game, (since they are not basing the plot on a specific movie or book) the characters talk. The voices are pretty good as well, but I'll talk more about that in a second. One of my favorite things about the game is Stan Lee. He appears all over the game and needs to be rescued around NYC and all the levels, and if you save him from everything, you unlock him.Cons... (Mostly just nitpicking)-Repeated voices in the NYC map can be really annoying at times-Deadpool is annoying and his voice does not match his character (Marvel Ultimate Alliance Deadpool is funny and his voice matches perfectly)-The web-swinging as Spider-Man, Venom, ect is difficult and frustrating-Having to get all the gold bricks can easily become boring-When I first got this game, my biggest problem was that Nightcrawler was not included, and he was my favorite Marvel character (mostly because I like his design)-My biggest problem with the game now, is that some of the characters either do the exact same thing as other characters, or do absolutely nothing, (Mary Jane Watson, Gwen Stacy, Destroyer Minifig, Aunt May, Mini Sentinel, ect.)-Sometimes, the game will stump you by being unbelievably cryptic, (or maybe I'm just an idiot)Conclusion...Overall, it has its flaws it could improve on, but I still found it fun. 8/10"

So I gave it a shot and for the love of god I think I found this more addictive then half the games I have played of late. Not only is this just childish fun for all ages its was made to to practically just enjoy.Not only that it is a game I can keep around and save for my kid when she is a bit older and can use controllers and such right that she would most likely enjoy. It was fun to play and have my friends watch to have them get jumpy when im at an edge or guess what the next thing to be constructed to go forward would be. Thanks to the play time on this one I will be grabbing more of these games in the future. They are a good games to chillout with alone, with family, or with friends.The nest part of feeling like a giant kid again is seeing characters I grew up with used to entertain kids still and just like some of the movies out there this game delivers that. Its a nice introduction to characters for kids of all ages who don't know who they are or may have only heard of them. That and this game gets you thinkingand changing thing up with the needs of other characters to work together to get things done or the need to g back with a certain character just to unlock things. Its a small mental and memory practice in a creative game.If your kid, friend, or family member loves fun games, has ever loved legos, and loves super heros this is a good grab for them.

Several times I got physically stuck or a boss fight trigger never happened and I couldn't continue.  Starting the level over sucks.- Confusing at first.  There are a few standard interactive points that certain classes of character must hit.  Until you learn what those are it is maddening.  Furthermore, there are a some obvious interactive points that you CANT hit in story mode because you don't have the right character.  Those are intended to be done later in free play mode with different characters.- Help text sometimes is helpful, most of the time not.  Always distracting, and is laid out badly on my ultrawide monitor (props for supporting that res though)- If there are two players and only two characters in a level, you can't switch.  I spent a bunch of time at first swapping controls for players 1 and 2.+ TONS of classic Marvel characters, each with fun dialog and powers.+ Cartoony violence and the fact that you can't actually die or lose any progress makes this game perfect for young gamers.+ The main story line is a good length and spans many locations and playable characters.+ There is lots extended play through side quests in New York City and replaying levels in free play mode to collect all the secrets.This game was lots of fun to play with my young son, and I would recommend it for kids.

Fortunately, the joy of LEGO seems to be a better fit for the cheeriness of Marvel properties than the dark, moody Batman. Sure, the PC controls are still not great and online multiplayer is still absent, but better camera placements, better balance of action and puzzles, as well as smarter AI pathfinding make 'LEGO Marvel Super Heroes' way more enjoyable. The set pieces are more epic, and the locales feel less claustrophobic than the 'LEGO Batman' games, too.The biggest highlight of 'LEGO Marvel Super Heroes' for me, however, is the size of the superhero roster. Having over 100 A- and B-list Marvel characters unlockable and playable at various points in the game is quite impressive. The anticipation of unlocking characters like Wolverine, Gambit, Deadpool, Daredevil, and Punisher keeps me coming back for more. So, yes, 'LEGO Marvel Super Heroes' may still have its flaws, but what it does right is so well-done that I can easily overlook them."

For comic fans it's a must, as I have little hope for any other superhero games coming out as good as this, or with the sheer level of variety of characters, all of whom play with their full range of powers: the avengers, fantastic four, spiderman and x-men dominate the main story, with interesting team combinations throughout and a final level where you team up (and so play) Dr Doom and members of the mutant brotherhood and sinister six. In free play the variety is astounding, including a huge range of heroes and villains from the guardians of the galaxy to captain britain.

Fun Open World, Cool Charcters most of us will know, fun levels and worth the money. Better than the Avengers edition of the game. Voice actors are good, but not the same as the ones in the movies. Controlls can be wierd and has a some bugs .Save system is wonky, but you figure ot out eventually. Great game.Long ReviewGreat game. The Open World is by far the strongest feature. NYC is full of hidden places to explore and has so many things to do, find, and enjoy. I cannot stress this ebough. If you like open world games, this game is great for that. Compared to games like Skyrim of the Witcher 3, the world is a little small, but it still decent size on its own and is jam packed full of stiff to do and characters to unlock. Even if you beat the game, the open world is a fun place to run around, destroy things, ride cars of bikes, and just have fun. The storyline is OK, albeit a bit short (15 levels), but the levels are long, and you can save at specific parts in the level. It is a bit buggy and the controls can be a bit goofy and cramped. The best way to play is with a controller, or spacing out the WASD movement keys from the action keys. Otherwise, it feels like your hands are cramped together. If you are not a Marvel nerd and dont know all the heros and villians, dont worry. The game isn't really full of random heros. If you have seen any modern day Avengers or X men movies, you will be mostly fine. There will be some characters you do not know, but it doesnt detract from the game. The game does a really nice job of blancing heros and villains in the story, and playble ones. The more common ones are used in the storyline, and the more obscure ones are used in free play annd are unlockable. And if you are a Marvel Superfan, it does have easter eggs, hints, and other things you will enjoy as well. Extra levels and usage of the gold brick make this game have even more replayability. Deadpool and Stan Lee  cameo a lot, adding to the funny atmostphere of the game. The chrarcters, while not voiced by the actors from the modern day movies, still are well voiced, and drop a lot of puns and jokes, customary to all lego games.

I was in despair for i longed to see another 100% but it was either get a wii U,Xbox one,or PS4. I knew this wouldnt happen so i gave up. And when i saw the trailer for this game i was just sad and heartbroken because i knew i couldnt get what was my dream all these years...BUT ALAS I earned those 20 bucks from dog sitting and hardwork,looked at all the awesome games i could buy like a kid in a candy shop,and after deep search and thought,I got what was rightfully mine. This game is so fun, the platforming is amazing and the freeroam is wide and the city is lively with people going about their day and not even caring about the world they live in, the puzzles are a bit unique compared to my standards,and the graphics are very crisp and lively to me beacuse ive played on wii, the characters are so filling and fun to play with i cant even choose a favorite this game will keep you bust for a long time.

That's really what Lego games are about.  In the world of Lego games, this is one; if you have played another of the series and liked/disliked it, your experience should be similar.  If you're a Marvel fan, even better.  Lego games involve a whole lot of smashing things, punching and shooting piles of enemies, and collecting hidden object, often found only by going into freeplay mode and using a character you unlocked somewhere.  I have found these games a bad idea for my hyper six year old, who will get too 'into it' and jump off couches and smash things, including his brother.The cast of characters is big, catering to a wide array of Marvel fans.  I found that I generally play with a very small handful of characters, and switch if I absolutely have to.  Iron Man (mach 47 suit) was my go-to.  There are two forms of flying, one where you actually ""fly"", and one that is sort of a hover, which means you'll never get a hovering character off the ground by more than a few feet, and so they are annoying to wander around with.  Phoenix, who can fly, got a lot more play-time than Jean Grey, who hovers; Magneto was only used if I needed his metal-moving abilities.  Vehicles are about the same; once you hop on the Cloud Rider vehicle, you find that it's awesome acceleration and ability to fire missiles pretty much means nothing else can compare (and I wasn't even aware you could fly with it until I just now looked it up).  I've looked at the DLC characters, and without any additional storyline promised or achievements to earn, haven't seen a real reason to buy it unless you just gotta have the characters.The dialogue is good.  The characters are voiced very well for the most part (yeah, there's a few that are a little annoying: that one buggy quest where the girl wants you to find her boyfriend and at least a dozen times he isn't spawned...  Yeah, I could never hear her threaten to force him to watch ""rom coms"" again as long as I live).  Deadpool in particular pops up regularly with a lot of attitude delivered well in his lines.There are some bugs, and a spot or two where you might need to look online to find out how to get to or solve a couple of the quests (one annoying thing is that you may get a marker on your map for a quest that isn't yet available, so when you come back a flying platform may have appeared and you don't exactly know why it wasn't there before).  Sometimes a quest NPC won't spawn when they should.  Overall tho, it's a solid game, good for kids a little older and less impressionable than my own right now, and my wife and I have had a lot of fun beating every bit of it (two DS3 controller, HDMI attached to the living room TV, after the kids have gone to bed).

Fight enemies, break stuff, build stuff, solve minor puzzles, beat level, repeat.  It's simple but addictive, especially with all the hidden stuff in every level.  There's a large ""overworld"" where you can basically play Lego GTA in New York only without the lego cops coming after you for smashing things, attacking people or stealing cars.  The characterizations are cartoony and a bit tongue in cheek but still spot on for the personalities of the characters and combat...  Oh my god, how on Earth did they manage to make combat in a Lego game feel closer to how the characters would actually fight than in ANY other comic based game I've ever played?  Hulk flings people around, Spider-Man does web slinging antics, Black Widow does ridiculously cool moves...  Excellent job.  The graphics aren't going to blow anyone away but what impressed me was how amazingly well this game plays with the graphics settings cranked all the way up on my graphics card that has a hard time playing newer games AT ALL.  As always, the button mapping on keyboard is really weird.  This game was clearly made for consoles as you can't type anything when you'd expect to.  You also have to use unusual buttons for confirming and cancelling selections.  Definitely play with a controller and not a keyboard.

The lighting and water effects are beautiful and well done, but it's lego bricks! Ha ha! If you have played any lego games, you know they are goofy and fun with essentially the same main story arc as their theme. This is by far one of the best lego games I have ever played and is one of the first that implemented actual voice acting, which in my opinion was a good move and they cast some great voice actors. Nick Fury sounds just like Sam Jackson and a few voices are actually the same actors from the films such as Agent Phil Coulson.What I don't like:The controls are a bit wonky. Great controller support, but the standard control set up is awkward and does not seem very practical when in game.

There is no shame in playing it alone, as it is a nice, light and happy distraction for anyone to play. But you have to remember that it is a children's game designed so that the adults playing it don't feel like smashing their faces in the floor while playing it with their kids. Its doesn't have complex controls, the puzzles aren't puzzles, the fights are mostly scripted and there is no challenge in getting through this game. That doesn't stop it from being fun though, the writing was funny enough, the characters and events cute and amusing in their behavior and appearance and the novelty of the story was good. I enjoyed myself playing the game, but having played this game it definitely cooled my excitement over other Lego games since I now know what to expect. It is a definite recommendation for anyone with kids though, the game is huge and will keep them busy for hours on end.If you want to read about the game in more detail you can find the rest of the review here:http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/08/lego-marvel-super-heros.html."
,Recommended,249130,18022480,"Posted: 13 September, 2015",all,ReedlyDeedly,"This game is super fun! There's plenty of varied things to do. The campaign is fun, complete with the typical LEGO brand humor. There's oodles of things to do outside of the campaign in the form of collectables, side quests and races.I only have one gripe about this game: the controls. The keyboard controls are as follows: WASD for movement, PL:"" for camera control, and HJK for your abilities/character swap. During the campaign, this isn't really a problem. Most of the levels are 2.5D, so the camera has only one angle that works. Even in the more open parts of the campaign, the camera works. I believe it's because in campaign mode, your camera controls are more of a 'head turn' type thing. In Free Roam mode, however (whenever you're not in a campaign mission), it switches to full control. This doesn't really become a problem until you try to complete the races - you'll need to go through a checkpoint, and the next checkpoint will usually be a few pretty tight turns away (i.e., you'll need to be swinging the camera back and forth with the steering wheel). Combine that with the fact that Ithinkthere's a limit on how many key pressed can be read at once (I think the cap is 3). So for flying: You can fly straight, up and to the right. But with no camera control.*SMACK*right into a building.The other problem with controls: there is no way, to my knowledge, to play single player with a controller. If you somehow get the controller to stick as the default setup for Player 1, Player 2 automagically joins in with you having simultaneous control over both characters.So if you can get around wacky control issues (the first issue is similar to other LEGO games, the problem with the controller is not), this is definitely a game to check out. I wouldn't recommend buying it full price, nor would I recommend the DLC. I don't own them, but I can say I never felt anything was lacking (there's also no mention of the DLC inside the game)."

It's like a child's game and I only recommend it for kids up to the age of about thirteen.  Having said that it looks quite well made and the gameplay feels o.k.  I'm just too old for it (I'm an adult).  Nonetheless I will give it a positive rating because it is a good game for kids.

The ending is Beautiful, and its really epic. If you are not really a Huge Marvel Fan then you won't enjoy it as much as a real fanboy as myself.Let's Talk about some of the good stuff; When you first get the game you only have limited characters, so puzzels are basiclly the same and some people might not like the sertain character so I recommend to finish the game the starting on the side missions. the flying mechanics are just perfect you can get around easily and fast and the flying animations for any character with wing, e.x Vulture, Is very cool. The web swinging animation is really awesome for any of the web swinging characters.Lets Talk about some of the Bad stuff; The web swininging in this game is not very fast, so its not always the best way of transportation. There are no such things as Suit change in this game not similar to Batman Lego games so you are stuck with that one chracter with the same abilities for the rest of the mission. The missions are mostly easy so you won't find it hard; The game as usual has no difficulty setting.I hope this helped you decide if you would buy this game or not. Have a good day.Sincerely,TheOfficialMT"

IMO, I think LEGO tends to make better superhero games than some of the serious ones I've seen.  None certainly include the sheer amount of playable chacters.Mission tells a fun story that involves almost all the major mainstays of the Marvel universe.  After finishing the mission, there still the long, and tedious, task of trying to 100% the game.There's lots to do and this game will kill a lot of time to dedicated achievement unlocker.

Lego Star Wars and Lego Batman were two of many games that I played too much on the PS2 with my brother. Now I'm trying out a 2013 game on the PC, Lego Marvel Super Heroes.The game keeps the same gameplay formula as previous IP's in the series, where you have tons of characters to unlock, a story mode with a lot of collectibles and a free play mode (a big map where you can roam and collect and achieve more). You fight, build, solves puzzles, collect, achieve, race, complete challenges, play different heroes and so on. The story mode is a bit weak and does not offer anything special. The game is pointed towards children and you will get that kids humour a lot :). I would rate the difficulty easy/medium, since some of the challenges are a bit hard. The controls are fair enough on ground level, but I struggle to fly with different heroes. I recommend to play with a controller. You can either play solo, or local split-screen.I bought this game mainly to collect and play different super heroes. The game has a lot of content and so much to achieve. You dont play the game for the story mode, but for the freedom and all the fun you get from the Lego games. I used around 40 hours to collect everything and the game was really fun. There are so many characters to play, vehicles to drive, aircrafts to fly etc. The free play mode gives you a big city to play with. From there you can acess story mode missions, races, get challenges/task from bystanders and do common super hero stuff.If you like to collect/achieve and are a fan of Lego/Marvel Super Heroes, I strongly recommend this game.

Meaning this game is no exception, it has met and well exceeded my expectations from a LEGO game and from a superhero game. It is well balanced but at the same time the characters feel very unique and powerful in their own respect. The game runs great on my PC, I havent had a single texture or hitbox error of the sort you would expect from a low budget PC port, if that is indeed what this is. The physics feel very solid if it were not for the controls being almost frantic, adding super power combo controls to the 4 buttons used in a normal LEGO Video game configuration. The LEGO pieces feel very realistic and have a very plastic weight to them as they would in their actual form, thats not to say that the models that are sold dont feel sold. As for the storyline and the length of the main missions, I believe they are ideal, 15 missions (If im not mistaken) each running about an hour if you really get into exploring the whole level. The story is as good as you would expect from a LEGO game if not a bit better, given that it has character voice actors (Who do lego models a lot of justice for having a voice). All plot lines are well paced and have more than a few catch yet subtle jokes and references, making it a more than enjoyable experience even with the narratives lighthearted tone.In closing, The only thing to say more would be that this is the only review I have every felt necessary enough to post on steam, being a fan of the LEGO Video games and naturally scrutinous of squals, this is easly a 10/10 for the LEGO franchise.Recommend to fans of LEGO, Superheros, and Video games in general."

Well, have you ever considered this tiny, little opinion of, if Steam is correct, 94% of the people who have bought and reviewed it, that the game is just good.  It's silly and fun.  You don't need super complex plots and everything, and if you have a controller, gameplay is great.  Going back for secrets and exploring NYC for others as you unlock more characters with various powers to deal with obstacles.So, yea, it's a LEGO game, it's not serious, but webslinging still felt good (not Spiderman 2 for PS2 good, but we're still hoping someone will once again make a game of that caliber)."

Or, perhaps, the metric buttload of unlockable content, which requires you to go on adventures FAR beyond the story to acquire. Maybe it's the controls, which are not very keyboard friendly, but got me through just fine....no, no it's not that.LEGO Batman 2 has some strengths over this. I thought character interaction during the story mission, and the overall plot, was stronger and more interesting. LEGO Marvel, admittedly, just tore a bunch of stuff out of the various movies and glued it together wherever they could make it sort of fit. Buuuuuuuut on the bright side, that still ended up being awesome.I know we're all probably sick of LEGO games by now, but LEGO Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean are behind us...so we no longer have to worry so much about them definitely being terrible and worth skipping. We can say, with reasonable certainty, that whatever Traveller's Tales pumps out next for an instant cash in will be playable, illicit a bunch of smiles, and perhaps drop upon us a crippling addiction to unlockable characters."

I mean, I love lego games, and I love Marvel comics (even if I think that DC is better). How could it go wrong? It was like a match made in heaven! Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be one.First off, it isn't really a bad game, it can even be considered as a pretty decent one. But for me, It was a massive disappointment.I'll start with the pros:+The hughe cast of character. There is a LOT of character, and that is great.+The open world sections are pretty fun, it can be really amusing to run around New York as one of your favorite characters.+The levels are pretty well made, forcing you to play with various characters and using their abilities to reach the end, like in any lego videogame. I know a lot of people don't like this mechanic, but I don't mind it.And the cons:-I hate comic books movies. I really do. And why I really hate marvel movies, is because they now leave their mark in comics. For exemple, Hulk is now stupid again, we have the ""Nick Fury jr"" and Coulson bullcrap, and Iron Man, one of Marvel's worst and most hateable character (at least, in my opinion), is now the big figure of Marvel. And the game is fully influenced by the movies, with Iron Man everywhere (Urgh), Coulson and many more things that are just here to please people who only watch the movies.Ho and poor Dr.Aldrich Killian and Mandarin. Iron Man 3♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you and this game continues.-There is a really poor use of characters. A lot of great characters are here, but they are just not the characters that I grew up to love. Their personnality is either altered, or thrown in a wash machine. They are often used in a really poor way. I get it, most of it is used for the humor and all and all, but sorry, Doctor Octopus cleaning up Daily Bugle office? really-Many characters are here. But you need mondey to buy them. And they aren't cheap. At all. So be prepare to do a lot of grinding if you want them all. I don't mind grinding, but for this game, it was just not worth it.-The music is annoying as hell. More than once, I cut the sound. However the one when you jump of the Hellcarier is actually pretty good.-Boss battles are repetitive as ♥♥♥♥.-The final level... I won't say anything. Just knowing that it exists is enough.-Also if like me, you don't have a controller, you may find the control a little bit unfriendly. The game wasn't made for a keyboard and you can see it really quickly.Conclusion: I excpected a lot from this game, maybe too much. I didn't like how the characters I like were treated and the fact that the Marvel movies now spread their influence everywhere just makes me furious. I wanted to love this game, and even though it played ok, in the end, it was a massive disappointment."

What's this?  It's based on Marvel Comics?  Hmmm...then this game might have a chance.Unfortunately, it doesn't. If you have played (most of) the previous LEGO games made by Traveler's Tales, you'll see what I mean.  Every single LEGO game that comes out is the same thing: Break stuff, build stuff, get studs, buy stuff with studs, use specific characters to unlock secret stuff, etc. and the series just gets crappier and crappier. Nothing really changes in the LEGO games, but hey, at least they talk in this one.  The gameplay in LEGO games never change, sure this game is one of the first open-world hub LEGO games, but that doesn't change its gameplay. The puzzles and things you do are still the same silly, unoriginal, ridiculous things  that actually make it feel like LEGO, but not the thing that's in LEGO form, not for one moment in these games can those puzzles and stuff you do be serious and original.A lot of people say the controls are crappy in this game, but I kind of grew up with PC gaming so I am used to any PC controls no matter how bad.  Yes, the flying and vehicle controls are kind of weird and eventually get annoying, but I don't really care and it doesn't bother me anymore.  By the way, who gives a flying rats crappy behind about mouse control?!  Seriously, it's a LEGO game, they never have mouse control, deal with it you freakin' idiots!The story is original, I'll give it that, but terrible. The humor is weak and there's too much of it. And some of the story doesn't even make any sense, for instance, Doctor Octopus and Agent Coulson cleaning up the Daily Bugle, seriously?  I know this game's audience was heavily targeted at children, but they could've been a bit more serious with this game. Come on, it's Marvel, treat it with respect you loony-toony game developers. And what the heck is Howard the Duck doing in this game?  Better yet, what the heck is Howard the Duck doing in Marvel in the first place?!Now I want to go on record and say that I LOVE the Marvel films, but this game just makes a mockery of all of it. They even left out some key Marvel characters: Quick Silver, Ultron, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and other important characters.Oh wait, you want to get %100? Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh hoooooh! These games are RELENTLESS when it comes to secret content. It will take you MONTHS to unlock every single little damn thing in this game. I only own ONE LEGO game where I got %100, ONE. Trust me, don't waste your time unlocking all that crap, it's just not worth it. I would rather watch Disney's Frozen a thousand times so I can play the whole damn movie in my head while having Let it Go stuck in my head in the process than get %100 in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes.This game is crap. Don't you DARE buy this game, because if you do, you'll be giving Traveler's Tales money and giving them another reason to create another one of these LEGO-shaped garbage cans.If you're a kid, this game will probably be the best thing that's ever happened to you. If you're an adult, not so much.3.8/10Seriously, don't bother with this game. If I were you, I'd instead wait for Rovio to come up with an Angry Birds Marvel Super Heroes and buy it immediatley. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Marvel in Angry Birds would probably be a whole lot better than this stupid game, trust me."

There is a first for everything and I'm glad I tried.The game is very linear with 15 levels and while at times I got stuck, it always end up being some easy task which I didn't think of, or some lego structure I didn't smash through. The boss fights at the end of every level are extremely easy and repetitive though. To be honest, I enjoyed the puzzles more.I would not recommend this game, with the pushing factor that if anyone were to read this review, it would be someone on my friend list, and most of them wouldn't enjoy it either.

It gets a non-recommendation because of the unwieldy PC controls that make the game more or less unplayable without an XBox controller.  This is my first Lego game purchase and it will be the last."

76561198025148074,Not Recommended,249130,10034875,"Posted: 6 May, 2014",all,futzable,"Traveler's Tales LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is so much disappointment.The controls are kludgy as ♥♥♥♥.  I am playing on PC, so this may be due to the port.  However, I use WASD for movement of my character as well as selection in SOME menus, while I can only use the arrow keys for selection in other menus.  Sometimes the key to press to make a selection is Enter, other times it's U, J, or H with apparently no governing rules regarding why ONE KEY ISN'T ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE.Speaking of one key, the U key is used to switch between characters so you can use various powers to progress in puzzles and advance the story. In free play, an extended pres of the U key brings up your character menu so you can access areas or items unavailable to the characters allowed during story play.  Unfortunately, with characters that have a second identify (last I checked, that's literally all of them, though this doesn't happen with every single character) such as Spiderman's Peter Parker or Bruce Banner's Hulk,  you have to wait for a three to five second animation  while they change identities because you can press the U key again to bring up the character selection menu.Regarding the character selection menu: there are 155 playable characters in this game.   While this sounds cool on it's face, it gets to be somewhat annoying in practice.  Instead of having 155 individual selections in the character menu, versions are grouped into one selection which cycles.  Iron Man is a prime example as to why this bogs down the game.  There are 5 or 6 versions one can play, some with different abilities.  One of Iron Man's abilities is an energy ray with is used to cut or destroy gold objects (Mark 42).  If you want to select this from the character menu, you have to highlight the selection and wait for it to cycle through.  Not every version has this ability, meaning that if you want a specific one, you have to time your selection properly or wait for it to cycle through again.  This may appear to be a small gripe, but having to wait every single time you wish to select this character for that ability adds up quickly.There are no controls governing camera direction while in the game.  If a character has an ability to aim, one can use this to somewhat direct the camera, but it's still time consuming and not always easily accessible.  If something ends up behind the 4th wall of your screen, you have to move towards the camera long enough for the games to spin it around to your character's back.  Adding this to the lack of finesse in moving a character adds more headache to the game.Vehicle movement is even worse than character movement.  In a game where a large portion of side missions require racing to acquire an object, hard turning becomes your enemy.  The challenge becomes not hanging one's self up on the sides of the track instead of getting to the goal in the allotted time.Other issues with the side missions are that most are fetch mission where in you have to go somewhere, usually across town, acquire an item or find an individual, and return to the NPC which started the mission.  This means you may swing halfway across the city as Spiderman or fly quick as Thor, Iron Man, or anyone else with the ability, find your target, and then WALK this secondary NPC back to the starting point.  If you move too quickly, you have to turn around to get them to follow again.  Not every side mission is like this, but other issues regarding the camera or character movement suck most of the fun out of these.While a tutorial level isn't necessary for every game, most controls are only mentioned at random during loading screens.  Given the immense size of the game world, it would seem that a quick run through could have been included without sacrificing any of the overall game play.This game is not as much fun as it should be, given how many fun LEGO games are in existence.  I picked this up during a sale for 4.99 and I still feel as if I over paid for it.  The initial excitement of getting to play as my favorite Marvel characters has quickly diminshed and I may finish this game at some point.  Right now, it's run through part of a mission, save (assuming it doesn't lock up, though I accept that may be a lacking machine as opposed to poor programming), and then come back for another small snippet at a later time.  It's difficult to get into this game for longer than 20 minutes in that the 2 second wait here and difficult controls make that feel like a drudgingly long time."

There is zero option for on-line multi player in any way, including local network. It is only possible to have multiple people playing on one PC. I suppose that I should have researched it beforehand, but I find it very stupid that LEGO games, which are so geared towards co-operative play do not allow for on-line multiplayer.

Lots of invisibile walls, which in my mind always always equates to poor game design and inexperienced developers.  With Marvel behind this, you'd think they would have invested a couple dollars hiring a legitimate development team, one that could come up with a better level design than the weak offerings within.I bought the game for the setting, and the characters, but it is really a poor offering and disappoints beyond words.

,Recommended,249130,10479320,"Posted: 15 June, 2014",all,The Old Dude,"WARNING: Contains very minor spoilers. And chimichangas.There's a reason LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is one of the highest-selling LEGO video games of all time; actually, three reasons.First, the characters. The game features not only the existing Avengers, X-Men and Ultimate Spider-Man LEGOs on the market, but a legion of characters and vehicles either only recently released in 2014 or not even created yet. From the Fantastic Four to the Sinister Six, this game includes the majority of Marvel's well-known characters along with a handful of lesser-known ones. Plus they've included the legendary Stan Lee himself as a playable character possessing multiple superpowers. What more do you need from this game?Speaking of characters, the next reason is what the minifigures take part in: the story. You can tell the writers and game designers had fun trying to combine a coherent Marvel storyline with the quirky humor found in every other LEGO game. And you know what? They did it. The story features the Avengers, Fantastic Four and X-Men teaming up against villains like Magneto, Doc Ock, Doctor Doom, Loki, Abomination and Sandman, in an epic quest filled with crazy left turns that only a LEGO video game could have. And it all leads up to a stunning twist you'll never expect (so I won't ruin it for those who haven't played yet).Finally, the gameplay. I was very pleasantly surprised just from playing a free PC demo of the game which was released online early last year, featuring the game's very first level, Sand Central Station. This level features Iron Man (Mark 6), the Hulk and Spider-Man taking on Abomination and Sandman in New York's Grand Central Station. But what blew me away the most during the level was the sheer number of abilities each character had, from Hulk's famous Puny God move from The Avengers, to Spider-Man's ability to actually swing around on a web. When I finally bought the actual game, I was thrilled to discover that the rest of the characters in the game were just as incredible.So, if you're skeptical about buying this game, I suggest you try out the demo featured onmarvelsuperheroes.lego.comfirst, and if you still don't feel like buying the game, then at least you technically tried it for free. But based on my personal experience, I think all of your doubts will go away and you'll want to buy LEGO Marvel Super Heroes right away."

It's currently in the Steam Summer Sale 2014 for under £4 and if you're considering buying it, I'd definitely get it.With over 100 characters (More with DLC's) and 16 levels the game is great to play with friends or with your kids (Co-op uses the same keyboard but supports controllers)The only thing I think that would make the game even better would be to have more things to do on the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier like in LEGO Indiana Jones.Pros:-You can play as your favourite Marvel Super Hero (or Super Villain if you prefer)-Great to pass the time-Great for small gaming parties-Funny cutscenes-STAN LEE IS A CAMEO LIKE IN THE MOVIES!Cons:-Like most LEGO games it has similar mechanics/puzzles so collecting characters/vehicles can seem repetitive-Levels can also seem repetitive when you're always using the same characters-No option to turn off character speech (The people on the street get really annoying after bumping into them several times)For achievement hunters: You can get 100% achievements in less than 10 hours if you put your mind to it."

Building on and perfecting the formula created back in Lego Star Wars, Lego Marvel is a great mix of action and puzzles as you ultilise the different abilities of Iron Man, Captian America, Wolverine, Spiderman, Hulk and rest of the huge roster of heroes to navigate the story as well as the myriad of side missions scattered around the hubworld of New York City.  Activities include escort quests, racing games and timed puzzles, providing a nice variety to keep things interesting.  There are also character unlocks hidden throughout the city, so exploration is a vital party of the game.As with the other games, the graphics by no means revolutionary but succeed in bringing the world to life, with everyone looking suitably plastic and blocky, while the voice acting is genuinely humourous and adds a lot of charm.  Controls are decent, sticking to the standard layout from the other Lego games, though it is probably best to play with a controller if you have one.  As with the previous games, the fix camera can sometimes be an issue, but never enough to truly hamper the game.  The  running time of the main story mode clocks in at about 12 hours, but there is dozens of more hours of fun to be had once you start exploring, making this game great value for money.As a fun game for the family and a love letter to Marvel's superherous, this game is a winning success. Highly recommended!"

There are 15 missions that last 20-30 minutes, they're the standard lego puzzles that require certain abilities to get past.  The story is a standard superheroes vs. villains story but it manages to expand to as many parts of the Marvel Universe so it no 2 levels feel the same.  When not in a mission there is a big open world Manhatten with plenty of side missions and tasks to keep you occupied for hours.  Some of the most fun I have is jumping into New York from the hellicarrier, and boy did they knock the music out of the park.Lastly the best part is all the different characters you can play.  Beyond the standard Avengers, X-men, Spiderman, and Fantastic Four characters their are dozens of others some even more obscure.  You can run around as a LEGO Blade or Punisher, and of course there is Deadpool who pretty much narrates all the non main story parts.  Riding around as Captain Britain in the britmobile was funny as well.  The two DLCs add more characters from the new movies, no updated Falcon though :( .

They are not serious, easy to approach for all ages and levels of gamers, have a great mechanic that doesn't take the game too seriously, and actually manages to tell a decent story.Lego Marvel Super Heroes is no different! If you are a fan of the Marvel universe and love Legos, this is your game. The voice acting is done very well, and fit the characters. Hulk even sounds like the Hulk from the 90s cartoon series. While it does take a certain amount of time to get to, flying around as Iron Man or webslinging as Spiderman in a Lego NYC is pretty fun.The fact that it is the type of game that is half serious lore and half lego whackiness (i.e., you fall the pieces) makes it a good buy for anybody."

,Recommended,249130,8995515,"Posted: 6 February, 2014",all,bryns,"The game features pretty much all the Marvel characters you can think of, and is fairly tongue-in-cheek. Mr Fantastic at one point deploys himself as a parachute to save The Thing and The Invisible Woman, looking to the camera and saying ""I saw this in a movie once..."".As the story progresses, more and more characters, vehicles and locations are unlocked, and the story culminates in the heroes and villains joining forces to defeat Galactus (not a spoiler, since Galactus is in the intro cinematic and in the trailer).The story mode is pretty straightforward (it is a game designed for kids after all...) but completing that only gets you 20% of the way to completely completing the game. Once you complete the story mode, you switch to the Free Play mode, which lets you go over the game again, this time with all of the characters you've unlocked (so you can access additional bits of the level you've just played through to unlock extras). This becomes one of the more frustrating bits of any Lego game, the grind needed to feel like you've actually managed to make reasonable headway to complete the game.This version at least tries to open things up by creating a ""Mission Hub"" modelled on New York. You wander along the streets of the City, tackling side missions on your way (including saving Stan Lee from an increasingly bewildering array of situations). This addition (compared to the Mos Eisley Cantina hub from the Star Wars version) at the very least gives you some diversion from having to run through each of the 15 levels twice, but you still end up performing variations on the same side-quest a dozen or so times on your way to unlocking everything.Overall, it's a fun game (it's rather funny being able to re-stage your own version of the Hulk Vs Abomination fight from The Incredible Hulk in a Lego Harlem and have a load of Lego characters simultaneously cheer and tell you to ""watch it, buddy!"") and if you're a Marvel fan, you're going to get a kick out of it. 100% completion is a long slog, and if you're not a fan of open world sandbox games, you're likely to drive yourself a bit mad trying to finish it."

Easy controls, a fun story, decent graphics and a very high replayability made this game close to perfect for me. Allow me to detail out to you what makes this game so good:1. The characters. The characters themselves are a blast to play with. Everyone's favorites are here, from Iron Man and Captain America, to Doctor Octopus and Doctor Doom. Every character has their own special ability to help you along in the story quest and side missions.2. The story. I won't spoil for those yet to play. Just know the story is good.3. The graphics. In case you're wondering ""How does Lego affect good graphics?"" Well, the backdrops of New York City are rather spot-on, and the transition from Lego to Non-Lego is practically flawless.4. The controls. Everything is typical from a Lego game. They barely ever change controls, so if you're a veteran lego player, like me, then you know what to do pretty much instantly. If this is your first Lego game, well, don't worry, you'll get the hang of the controls pretty quick.5. The world itself. It's an open-world Lego version of New York. The buildings put into it, and the effort, shows clearly the moment you just from the Helicarrier. Yes, the Helicarrier is in this game.6. The voice acting. I'll admit, some voices they chose for characters threw me off. But upon looking up the cast, I was amazed to see Nolan North, Steve Blum and Tara Strong in the cast.Of course, every game has its downsides. Don't worry, this game only has two.1. The camera. The camera angle is odd at times, getting stuck where you don't want it to, and then some parts of the game may be hard to see. However, you can usually fix this by switching to the other character, running back a ways, then switching to the first character.2. The AI. I often had to deal with enemy AI and my follower's AI getting stuck on parts. Sadly, there wasn't really much of a fix for this.So do I recommend this game? Yes, very much so. it has the typical Lego humor (with voice acting), a great story, all the characters we know and love, and so much more! It'll most certainly keep you entertained for hours upon hours, and when you do get bored, just relax and read some of Deadpool's comics! They'll get a chuckle out of you, guaranteed."

Not to mention, the levels are really only about a quarter of the total content in the game, the post-storyline game is probably somewhere from 66% to 75% of the game.  Well done, Lego and Traveller's Tales."

I mean, honestly, I've put half as much time into this as I have Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and I still haven't beaten the story yet in the latter.However, I can tell you for a fact that it is a FUN game. It has surprisingly high-quality voice acting, as well as an original storyline combining pretty much every important Marvel character in history. And a duck. We don't talk about the duck. While it  can take a bit of practice to get the hang of the keyboard targeting programs, it makes up for that with the seeking quality of projectiles, and there is a wide variety of different heroes, villains, and Deadpool you can use to figure out different situations and help different people.Oh, and don't forget - DEADPOOL. Oh god. He's hilarious. The first time I noticed him, I was just fighting Doc Ock in Times Square, and then I looked up. And then I was like 'Oh, look, there's Deadpool in a helicopter videotaping the whole thing - wait what?' He just pops up in the most random of places, and has this innate ability to be hilarious. He's also the narrator in bonus levels, which gets extra hilarity thrown in.But yea. I highly suggest you buy this game."

The huge hub world of manhattan was one of the coolest things I have seen in a lego game and the amount of characters and little quick missions was enormous. As you can see I have a lot of hours playing this game and only about 5 of those are afk hours. (sometimes has a glitch where you quit but still runs) Those hours are put in to get 100% and all achievements. This is by far the largest and most polished lego game I have played. Playing everything from lego star wars 1 to lego pirates. Each game has their special touch that makes them a joy to play but this to me really has it all. The voice acting from lego LOTR is back and in this installment the voice acting is done in a way where it keeps much of the humor you have come to expect from a lego title but still the cutscenes are not quite as creative as lego star wars 1 and 2. Graphically this game looks amazing. Still no crysis 3 but in comparison to older titles this is by far the one that will make you say wow this looks like Manhattan. Bulidings have reflections and shadows and flying through New York or in a huge battle the game never drops below 30 fps (and my machine isnt too powerful). Instead of tying in with a movie this game creates a story of its own. The story is average I would say but the idea really brings all the villans you know and heroes you love together. As with every lego game there is a ton of collectibles and this game is no different. There are 250 gold bricks 11 deadpool red bricks (gotten from secret levels unlocked with gold bricks to get extras, cheats,) 150 minikits. There are also a ton of vehicles and characters, coming in at 115 characters including the different skins( I belive this is the number). This game is a great purchase even at 20 dollars. I think of it as i can buy a $1 app on ios and play it for an hour then throw it away, well i can pay $20 dollars and get 50 hours well ok that is a deal.Pros-------Huge hub world-Tons of characters-tons of collectibles-Good humor-Animations for characters are fantastic-Each character feels unique in combat and in the hub-Graphics are the best yet-Music is amazing-Stan Lee makes a ton of cameos (with a nice suprise if you help Stan all 50 times)-The story is fun and fits in with the marvel universe-Its a lego game of course its good-The hub world feels alive-Controller as always is great to play withCons---------Flying controls are a bit tricky to get a hold of and even after getting to 100% they still are hard-Voice acting takes a bit of the lego imagination out of the game-Spidey move very slow through new york (I always played as a flying character and not spidey :(...)-A few very tricky gold bricks due to a few confusing control schemes.-Keyboard controls are awful.BUY THIS GAME ITS SO GREAT!!!!!!!"

It did not disappoint, with the same level of thinking skills required to get through levels. However, checkpoint saving does not work well, sometimes characters get stuck into death traps, respawning and dying instantly, and the camera is horrible. Trying to select a character with many different ""costumes"" such as Iron Man requires a waiting time, and it would be good if I could cycle it with the arrow keys. However, I still love this game, with the free roam being very well desigined, having races, unlockables and side-missions well spread-out around the city. Despite requiring lots of patience in the free roam, the action in this game is undeniably awesome, and feels like a harmless version of GTA.Can Hulk Smash. 10/10."

The world ( or at least Manhattan) is in danger from supervillians, and Nick Fury, Agent Coulson and S.H.I.E.L.D must gather the very best heroes to defeat the evil. The story moves quickly, and you're straight into the action in Level 1 as you face Sandman as Iron Man and Hulk. Each level brings in new characters with different actions and abilities and soon The Avengers, Spider-man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and loads of other side heroes are involved. In the game you will face many villians such as the manipulative Loki, the evil Magneto, the destructive Venom and even Doctor Doom himself while shooting jets of ice as Iceman, flying through the sky and shooting lasers as Iron Man, slinging webs to climb even the Empire State Building as Spiderman, and turning yourself into a teapot as Mr. Fantastic.Gameplay:Each superhero has unique abilties like wrecking, lasering, hammering, regenerating, clobberin', shrinking, web slinging and even....throwing squirrels! Outside of the action packed levels lies a huge open world - all of Manhattan! There's hours of activities to do in the city from skydiving to boat riding and sightseeing to car stealing - it's just like GTA except there's no sex, drugs, swearing or death...seriously, you can fall from the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier into Central Park with no parachute and you will still survive. I find myself spending hours inside Manhattan visting Times Square, the X-Mansion, even a circus! If you have no idea what im trying to say, just think of it as New York Simulator + superpowers.Pros:- Open world.- Levels with lots of puzzles and boss fights- Good replay value as there are quests and items to collect in Free play and the open world.- Fun for Marvel fans of all ages.- Fairly original story.- Unique LEGO models at the start of each level show where the mission takes place.- Agent Coulson and Maria Hill tell you all you need to know to carry out the mission.- Over 200 Gold Bricks to collect.- Character designer can make Iron Man have Hulk size and ability ( no need to buy the Hulkbuster, it is available though)- Ant Man shrinks - enough said.- Drivable cars, buses, boats, trains, helicopters and jets.- Voice acting is everywhere in New York, from gossip to road rage.- Stan Lee makes about 50 cameos.Cons:- World does kind of cut off and the idea of the bridge being down is a bit lame, I'd rather have Loki put a barrier round the city.- Flying and driving can be a bit haywire sometimes e.g my helicopter tipped over once and I crashed down into a crowd of people :(Conclusion:Overall, great game, seriously, what are you still doing reading this click that green button!9/10 - Would Marvel again.-DayvisIf you liked this review and found it helpful, have a look at my other reviews like LEGO Hobbit and The Escapists, more coming soon by the way!"

Played the 3DS version first and thought I was missing out on something, hit the nail on the head with that one. It's funny and is great for children, adults, fans of the Marvel Comics Universe and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The only thing I'd add is I'd add in a few more alternate costume versions of the characters (i.e. X-Force Deadpool, X-Force Wolverine, Spiderman 2099, Classic Ghost Rider, Classic Odin, Classic Nick Fury, etc). It's not perfect, there's a couple glitches here and there, but they're few and far between, vehicle controls are very very touchy, but it's something one could get used to. 8.6/10"

This is always a nice suprise for me as I commonly buy games that, dispite the system requirments being fine, turn out to be buggy or not work at all. The gameplay is fun as well, just like any other lego game. Naturally the dialogue is a little bit cheesy, but that doesn'y really bother me.

,Not Recommended,249130,16565087,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,schmell,"Reading the description and a lot of the reviews, I got a very different impression of the game than what it wound up being. The game gives you tons of tutorial popups (which you can't turn off) informing you of things that you don't care about/already know, but doesn't bother to explain important things like the save mechanics, which are confusing as all hell. The levels are pretty tedious and the entire game feels pretty restictive, limiting what you can do and how you can do it. I've played other Lego games before and have been very impressed by Lego's games in the past, but this one just isn't doing it for me. The game also doesn't really feel like it was designed for PC. This turned out to me more of a linear platform/adventure/puzzle game, where I was expecting it to be closer to Lego Island with superheroes."

It looks great, sounds great, plays great and runs great. It's like every aspect of this game has a common level of quality with each other! Did I mention it was great?But seriously though, all things considered this has got to be my favourite LEGO game out of the countless others developed by TT or otherwise.Graphically, the game stands out really well, and even with max settings the game runs at a smooth 60fps. The textures, while not the best I've seen look clean and rather sharp, coupled well with the lighting, which makes the game really shine! The framerate does drop at times, but only when cutscenes or new scenarios are bootd up, and the drop only lasts 2 or 3 seconds anyway.The game (with a controller at least) plays superbly, but an awful lot, if not exactly like other TT LEGO games before it, an 'If-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it' principle if you will. Character and vehicles controls are tight for the most part.And the writing. OMG I found the writing to be really clever and humorous at times, referencing pop culture (one of Sandman's lines references The Wizard of Oz) as well as the events of the films surrounding the Marvel Cinematic Universe (schwarma anyone?). And of course, the presence and character of yours truly De-HEY GUYS, ITS ME DEADPOOL, AND LISTEN IF YOU'RE GONNA BUY THIS GAME FOR ANY REASON DURING THIS UH, whatwasitwhatwasit uh... steam... monster.... uh... summer sale, hmm, yeah.

You can use many many powers such as flying, firing lasers, invisibility, telekinesis and many many more depending on the heroes and/or villiains you view.The story is very good and feels as if its a real marvel movie with different actors of course but alot of it very aimed for comedy.

But if you are a fan of Marvel comics you will really enjoy this game. There is a ton of content that the casual to the most hardcore Marvel comic book fan will appreciate. References range from the most recent Marvel movies to obscure and almost forgotten storylines or characters.Visually it is one of the best looking LEGO games I've played. NYC is faithfully recreated in LEGO form, there are dozens of characters to unlock and they all have unique ways to play, the music is top notch, the jokes and physical gags are really funny, and there is a lot more missions to play beyond the story. Also, there's a lot of Stan Lee, and the more of him the better. It's a really fun game, don't let the LEGO bricks fool you.If you are a little burned out by the LEGO series, then really there isn't a whole lot of new things here to entice you.

The reason why spidey can't ""really climb walls"" in the game, it's because it would be cheating in the game, since you can get access to almost anywhere, so instead it does a web splat every time you jump higher on the wall, eh good enough. I love the game has free roam in New York City, Deadpool is the hardest character to unlock, literally. You have to collect at least 200 gold bricks to be able to do all the deadpool bonus mission and find the hidden red bricks and then you unlock him, crazy right? I love that the game has the shield carrier, statue of liberty island, etc. Also it's really fun, since it's like marvel cinematic universe in lego with all the marvel characters including the XMEN. Also I highly recommend you to play this with a controller, any controller, I am playing with a Logitech f710 (i think that's the number) controller, it works well! I rate it 10/10. I would love to see a new marvel lego game to see if it's possible to travel in space and be the guardians of the galaxy in space, you can have those characters in this game, but it would be cool to fight in space and explore the Earth at the same time."

After completing LEGO® Marvel™ Super Heroes, I walked away with some great feelings. While playing, I experienced some things not expected, for me, in a LEGO® title. This game, in a sense, blew me away.Firstly, I was astonished with the level design and graphic art portion of the game. In a LEGO game, I was not anticipating such stunningly fun levels and amazing views. When I was casually running through the game, I couldn't help but to sit back and admire the breath-taking sights from a handful of missions. In addition, I felt myself become humbled by the pure strategy and thought required for certain puzzles I encountered.Also, I was bewildered by the animation qualityandvariety. Each time I aquired a new character, I just had to play around to marvel at (yes, it's a pun) the character's animations! On any occasion, I was purely and simply astounded.Finally, I have to recognize the game's story. Plainly put, Marvel™ Super Heroes' story is unique and intruiging. Keeping you interested, the storyline will take you through a whirlwind of Marvel™  mash-ups between all of your favourite characters. You'll experience a team of Captain America, Spider-Man, and Mr. Fantastic, for instance. The combinations are endlessly fun, and the synergy between them is boggling.LEGO® Marvel™ Super Heroes is simply one of the most fun LEGO® titles I have come across. If you're into LEGO® games, or just adventure games, pick this one up. You really can't go wrong."

But after a couple years and quite a bit more experience, these Lego games must not be my thing anymore. I'm running this on ultra high quality at 200-400FPS (seriously), but it's just not as good as I thought it would be. The game logic is terrible. It's unlike any other game I've played in the last several years. I've grown use to FPS shooters like Halo, Battlefield, CoD, etc. and other sorts of open world games such as assassins creed, GTA, Fallout, etc, and even objective games such as Portal and 2D scrollers. But no game has frusturated me more than this one. The game cannot be cheated, as what I've grown use to. I learn how to trick a game to work for me, to see what my abilities are. With this game, there's only one way to get to the next checkpoint, through the game logic, which is terrible. If you're stuck, there's no way of getting past, the game does not at all guide the player. The tutorial is awful, keyboard gaming on this is the worst. Controller is'nt bad.Yet, despite the frusturation of this, it's really still fun."

The missions themselves are fun and do a great job of utilizing the various characters in the marvel universe, but the real star of the game for me is the overworld. You get a gigantic (by LEGO game standards) overworld that consists of Manhattan with the helicarrier hovering overhead. The addition of flight means you can seamlessly fly from street level up to the helicarrier and the city is a playground by itself with lots of activity including traffic that you can charge through with a tank (or the hulk) sending bricks flying. Side missions abound with lots of hidden secrets to find.My only gripes are the bugs (thankfully none of them were game-breaking) and the character creator doesn't let you choose the powers for the minifigure, they are attached to different parts so to get the power combination I want usually results in a very strange looking character.Overall though this is an excellent game for LEGO or Marvel enthusiasts. Highly recommended."

The enemies just come wave after wave in small numbers as you progress through the levels. It's point A to B, destroy objects in order to once in a while construct a necessary device/object to progress further (I've only played one other LEGO game, so I assume this is the same formula for each game).Your health is four heart symbols, if you die u just respawn almost instantly, at the cost of all those tokens or whatever they're called that you collect throughout the level (I've never purposely died over and over until my tokens/points reach 0 so I don't know what happens)There's funny moments as expected for the Lego franchise, with funny dialogue and actions in cutscenes.Again, I've only played one other lego game that was the Lord of the Rings one. And the one thing I don't like is your ally's AI, even though the game's not hard at all, they mostly just stand around and get beaten, waiting for the character you control to defeat enemy units.I still haven't beaten this game though, mainly because I'm surprisingly bad at this at figuring out where to go. Several times I had to look online to figure out where to go. The last session I JUST played as of this review, it happened again, and I'm like ""screw this, I'll wait for a long long time if I ever want to play this again."" I don't feel like looking up walkthroughs for a game that's suppose to be this simple.I'd prefer just a normal non-lego version of the Avengers, but this game will do and will be in my backlog for a while.I bought on sale, not at the $20 it is listed at right now.

I love Marvel comics and it was very exciting being able to see and unlock so many characters, although they could have made a few better choices.. I for one was not very excited when ""Auntie May"" was the last character that I unlocked, lol... They hyped deadpool sooo much, but his playable character wasn't very versatile and was kind of disappointing. The levels were all great except for one that felt kinda like a demo.. and of course it gave you the greatest amount of coins, so it had to be played repeatedly, that was the only boring part really (trying to get coins). Overall, I would say this game is excellent though, its really really fun, which really made up for some of the insignificant not so fun parts. for instance, there are several iron man suits, and it takes a while for to game to scroll through them to allow you to pick your favorite.. I would have preferred being able to scroll through them on my own so that I could choose one faster. I found myself settling on a character that I've never heard of (the beetle) who had the same powers and was quicker to select. I would have preferred some more well known characters instead of squirrel girl, and pepper potts (Rescue is cool though).. and ones with actual superpowers unlike j. jonah jameson(why????).. they really could have chosen some better characters. overall I give it a 8.5/10"

Games like Lego Star Wars 1, though still amazing, do not compare graphically and combat-wise, with some of these newer games.Lego Marvel Super Heroes is an excellent bland of adventure, action, and open word gaming. It is perfect for kids, though older people may have a hard time remaining pacified with this game. The streets of New York provide an excellent portion of this games open world features, with the ability to travel to islands and different locations all over the place. The character variety is amazing. I believe that Lego Lord of the Rings is the only other Lego game with the same minifigure variety as this game. Lego Marvel Super Heroes exceeds Lego LOTR with the variety of characters powers and abilities. The addition of a character customization station pretty much completes this game. In it (the customizer) you can combine different heroes body parts to give your creation a combination of certain heroes' powers. My younger siblings have made a hybrid spider-man/captain America. It's probably the game's best feature. Lego Marvel Super Heroes is definitely something kids will enjoy.

This feels more of a developed Lego game as characters have a wide range of abilities and navigating through the levels requires work from every character. However, there are some problems. First, you can clearly see this is designed with controller in mind. You still can’t bind keys with the mouse which is ridiculous. Why can't I attack with left click just like all games do? I also think they made filling the stud meter to 100% way too easy. You used to have to destroy everything, pick up almost every stud to fill it, and that's how it should be. But I’m filling it up most of the time just playing the level normally, not even having to search for purple studs or anything. On the other hand, they made finding the minikits too difficult in my opinion. Anways, this game is still really, really fun and that's why I can recommend it.

If you are running anything less than 8 gb ram do not get this unless you are willing to deal with hella lag. Once again amazing game, please buy. I had it for xbox one and thought it might not transfer over very well as some games are harder to do on a computer than just a console, but this game transfers over perfectly and is actually simpler on the computer in my opinion. Havent tried split screen but that's an option. Great game for kids and adults alike. Some of the humor is a bit corny but that is just the way these Lego games are designed. I am not a big computer gamer, but my brother took the xbox along with LMS with him off to college and I was really missing the game because it was one of my favorite console games because it's simple and very entertaining; when I saw it on steam i told myself that i must have this.

I had no idea that Howard the Duck is actually a Marvel character!In fact, this game was a good (non-spoiler) introduction to GOTG before the movie.The game itself is typical LEGO game mechanics, some really annoying side missions and the odd didgy control moment but otherwise just a good laugh.Be warned, if you're the sort of person who wants to collect everything in a game then this one will take you a while to reach 100%."

It's probably Marvel's best game, filled with so many references, in-jokes, and playable characters that range from Professor X to Howard the Duck, that astute Marvel devotees will find themselves in some kind of childlike wonderland for the duration of the campaign. I'm not quite sure I can put myself in the shoes of non-Marvel fans; the LEGO gameplay hasn't seen any major overhauls since LEGO Star Wars first kicked off this style of co-op puzzle-action games, but it's still got a charm in its casual nature. It does wear thin though, especially when you're faced with puzzles whose solution is simple, though abstract or hidden. A definite thumbs up for fans of the franchises, but for everyone else, make sure you have a local co-op friend to share with."

It has a huge open world hub of a reinvisioned manhattan legofied with all the comic landmarks with a very detailed time square. There are over 100 lego characters which most require to unlock and buy with lego studs which arent too hard to collect since the game is loaded with it. Vehichles do return upgraded a bit with more uniqueness with character relations and all other stuff. But it sort of suffers since its too hard to resist to play as iron man (which you can collect most of his armor suits) or thor and just fly around the city and boosting your speed. Cheat codes once again return and sort of got a bit less powerful. Now you can only unlock the 2x multiplier instead of all the other ones combining to 3280x i believe which is really overpowering since you can get so many coins and just buy everything from the start. You can also unlock other characters, vehicles, and alternate skins for certain characters. Other game modifiers like more multipliers and detectors can be obtained by red bricks but now are called deadpool bricks which you can find in bonus gold brick gate levels (which you need certian amounts of gold bricks to build) and once you beat them you can free play it to activate character specific gates. Pc does suffer a bit. There is absolutely no controller support so dont bother trying to get softwares which is what i did or bother getting your controller to use it. Your left hand which is the movement keys wasd will be average placement. But most people like me are thinking its going to be the mouse to control the flight controls or camera, WRONG!!!!! The right hand uses uhjk. Which is a up down left right format so basically you have 2 hands on the keyboard to do everything. It sucks but i get used to it. Other side quest and mini games do keep you playing for hours trying to get 100% completion which usually is very time consuming. I really reccomend this game if your a classic lego game fan or even just lego fan in general since i grew up playing these games."

After a while puzzles become monotonous, but that isn't much of a problem unless players are going for 100%.Another thing to touch on is characters. Some characters feel out of place, especially ones with no super powers whatsoever. Without the ability to fly, shoot lasers, or explode things, you almost never find yourself using them for any purpose. Still, some are just fun little easter eggs and my only compliant here is the lack of certain heros from the story like Deadpool, who instead is left to give the player bonus missions most players will never even play.overall, I recommend this game to Comic book enthusiasts and Lego fans. i give it a 7.5/10."

With that being said, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes not only involves some of my favorite childhood heroes and villians, but it also acts as the largest LEGO game to date, with a large map of New York to explore in its blocky glory. You can play as classic characters like Iron Man, Spiderman, and the Hulk, but there's also characters I've honestly never heard of before, like the Wizard and Dormammuu. There are SO MANY THINGS TO COLLECT, from character tokens, to vehicles, to gold bricks, to deadpool bricks (oh yes, deadpool makes a large appearence in this game, and it's glorious) and more. It's quite the challenge. The story of the game is awesome and manages to tie in all of these heroes and villians pretty well. Different abilites are assigned to different characters based on their powers, and the way some heroes can attack are badass (Hulk even does the exact ragdoll throw he does to Loki in the Avengers if you do it right).

Not being interested in super heroes is no impediment to enjoying this game, it is good silly entertainment. The story is rather fun and involves a cavalcade of heroes and villains, most of whom I had no idea who they were but the different powers make for a nice varied levels. Having recently played LEGO Batman it is quite amazing how far these game have come over the years. The core gameplay is still ostensibly the same but it is so much more polished and there is loads of things to do between the levels. This is very much worth getting if you like LEGO games even if you might not be a fan of Marvel."

The graphics are bright and clean and the sound design is quite good. The story is entertaining and the character interaction can be quite funny, if a bit silly at times. I did run across a number of small bugs and it did crash 6-7 times over ~30 hours of gameplay causing me to lose around 10-15 minutes of progress each time. The gameplay, from what I understand, is fairly standard fare for the assorted LEGO games and I found myself getting bored with the free-roam portions of the game over time, so I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it quite as much if this wasn't the first one I played.

76561197992109671,Recommended,249130,12878788,"Posted: 10 November, 2014",all,SlyFoxBro,"If you’ve played any previous Lego titles, you should know the drill by now - they are family-friendly, humorous adventure games with a strong collection aspect worth hours of playtime. Though I would describe the Lego games as formulaic by this point, I don’t mean so in a bad way; they are more ‘reliable’ than ‘stale.’ As long as Lego Marvel Super Heroes capitalized on the successes of the previous games by Traveler’s Tales, then this title should have proven to be a solid choice.Thankfully, that is exactly the case. It is very hard for me not to recommend a Lego game, but despite my glowing affection for the series, I would never place them in an overall top ten list at year’s end, unless they would do something which would really re-define the genre. There really is no need, though, as the Lego games generally move onward and upward making basic quality of life changes.For this title in particular, the visuals have received a bump that I hope stays in place from now on. Smart lighting effects and motion blurs add to the production quality, but the superheroes’ minifigs are the most appealing change - for the first time in the series, they appear to be made of plastic, with a highly reflective finish, instead of the standard matte colors. A small update, admittedly, but one that really makes it feel as if you are playing with toys come to life.The story is somewhat fuddled and long, but that’s typical from Lego games which create their own tales instead of drawing upon pre-existing material, such as the Harry Potter games. These Lego games are best played when the story mode is rushed through from one mission to the next, in order to unlock Free Play mode for each chapter, so that item collection can begin in earnest. The voice acting is top notch, with several sound-alikes to the Marvel studios movies that come pretty darn close to the real deal. As for the interface and the controls…that is where I will hedge my complaints.Flying is very cumbersome in Lego Marvel Super Heroes - as the controls are mapped to two buttons (instead of to an analogue stick, which worked MUCH BETTER in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes), I typically wind up pinballing my hero all over the map as I try to effectively get from point A to B. Mentioning the map brings me to the other major complaint of mine - the map overlay is horrible. Lego Lord of the Rings got this feature down just fine - dotted lines easily showed you your path, while missions and side quests had informative text to display where you were going. Not so in Lego Marvel Super Heroes - the map is zoomed in very closely to the details, and none of which are labeled. Where are the missions at, from a glance? What unlockable heroes are being displayed around my cursor? These were features that were working JUST FINE only one game iteration ago, and they now feel worthless.Otherwise, I can’t really knock this game too much - the gameplay is still rock-solid, and these titles appeal to the random item collector that lives deep down in my psyche. For all of the games that exist on my to-do list right now, I still feel compelled to spend extra hours with Lego Marvel Super Heroes in an attempt to 100% complete it.

Rockband, though I'm aware of their existance. I bought this game on sale because if there ever was another lego game I was going to play it would be a marvel one. In terms of the amount of time I've played and am still playing I have had an immense amount of fun.Story wise in isn't exactly original. Something about cosmic cubes (or blocks), the tesseract, and galactus, I don't know I fell off quickly. The fun comes  wathcing some of your favorite and even disliked marvel characters interact with eachother. Being a game target at a younger audience, it is light hearted and fairly comical in places, like Hulk not knowing the limits of his own strenght and heroes and villians alike, generally being derpy.If you've played a lego game you have an idea of how it works but if you haven't you run around beating stuff up. breaking, and buliding things. There is a very large roster of characters from Gambit, Deadpool, Blade, to even charcters I've never heard of like.... absorbing man. There is  a large uniqueness to each charcter (even if that uniqueness is lame, lookin at you Aunt May) and I was generaly suprised how many characters you get to play as, after you unlock them anyway. Theres also a big overworld map that's littered with side missions and unlockables, thankfully marked on your map. Navigating through it is fun and I've spent extended periods of time with a friend just flying/wandering around the city for up to an hour, soetimes in the spider-buggy.I'm far from done with this game and I can't wait to see how many more familiar faces I get to play as. With a friend its even more fun, when guys get to far off the screen splits, Toejam & Earl style saving camera troubles (unless your in a corrider and your friend is flying character who won't stop moving).I personally feel this is a must have for marvel fans, lego fans, or anyone looking for a fun co op game. A definite A+"

76561198141556676,Recommended,249130,12665244,"Posted: 27 October, 2014",all,reggie6587,"In short, I would highly recommend this game, especially if you have played Lego games in the past and enjoyed them.  I always was a Lego fan, and this is no exception.There are so many characters to choose from, I'd say double than any other Lego game I've played.  The open world in this game is amazing, and there is so much to do even after the story levels have been completed.  The voice acting is decent, and the Lego humor is still there.  The fact that there are so many different characters allows for a lot of unique types of interactions, whereas in previous games you might only have different items to carry (like Indiana Jones, where everybody is a mortal human).There are a few flaws, most of which boil down to the game being pretty buggy compared to past Lego games and other games in general.  It probably has to do with Lego/Traveler's Tales not being used to handling such expansive games, but I've gotten physically trapped in places, and other glitches and freezes that force me to have to repeat the level or find some way to kill myself and hope I respawn elsewhere.  If you've played many Lego games in the past, I will add that minikits are not very complicated to find.  They usually just involve using some character who wasn't originally available on the first play through to do something (coughmagnetocough).  I remember that finding minikits in older games (the first and second Star Wars) actually was very difficult, or at least took multiple playthroughs, although there's a chance that was because I was just dumber back then.  Just thought I'd mention that.- Huge Open world +positive- Large selection of characters, 100+, +positive- Long levels, cool campaign +positive- Pretty buggy -negativeConclusion:  If you liked past Lego games, this is a no brainer, especially when it's on sale.  If you've never played a Lego game, this one is as good as any to try, although I might recommend a smaller scale game like the Star Wars ones or Indiana Jones ones.  If you can't handle bugs in your game, then I guess I'd stay away.  This is definitely not the best video game ever made, but I have had a lot of fun with it.  Emphasis on fun.  I'd also recommend the co-op, it's more fun with someone else.Bonus: I bought both DLCs on the cheap (like <=$1.50 for both), and they're not really essential to the game.  Both DLCs give you like 15 characters total maybe, and while some of them are cool (Thanos, Rick Jones), most are redundant (Dark Phoenix, The Warriors four) and dumb (Jane Foster mostly/only).  Get them when they're cheap, but it'll be more of a ""eh why not"" purchase."

76561198043879003,Recommended,249130,10821079,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,Mrthingus,"Without a doubt my favorite Lego game. Might even be one of my favorite games of all time.Lego Marvel features an impressive roster of characters, with over 150 characters (excluding DLC) to choose from. The impressive part is that each character has a unique moveset (some character even have a completely unique move) that helps keep them as individual characters and not copies of each other. Venom and Spider-Man or Wolverine, Beast and Sabretooth or even Hulk, Abomination and Blob might play the same but they don't really feel like a lazy palette swap of each other.The story features 15 levels and has been crafted specifically for the game. Like its predecessors, Lego Marvel doesn't lack the usual Lego humor, as the game is full of the same light-hearted humor that has been precent since Lego Star Wars. The story itself is somewhat decent and characters that make an appearance have the same-ish personality as they do in other forms of media they have appeared in.The voice cast features familiar voices of Nolan North (Cyclops, Deadpool, Magneto...), Troy Baker (Hawkeye, Loki...), Tara Strong (Mary Jane Watson...) amongst a dozen others that help give each character a personality. Adrian Pasdar, Fred Tatasciore reprise their roles as Iron Man and Hulk respectively and even Clark Gregg is present as Agent Coulson, not to mention Stan Lee as himself.Speaking of the audial, both the soundtrack and audio itself are really well-done. Skydiving from the helicarrier high above or racing is accompanied by an intense, gripping piece of music whilst running around the city feature a slower, more mellow melody. That's the best way I can describe the music of the game, it's fitting in the pretty much any context.The visuals of the Lego games have always been impressive for their time and Lego Marvel follows that tradition with bright, inviting, colorful visuals, a stark difference from the dark and gritty atmosphere of Lego Batman 2.Gameplay wise, there is little Lego Marvel adds that hasn't already been present since day 1. You go from level to level, collecting studs and minikits, using aforementioned studs to buy new characters, vehicles and Red Brick extras, then go back with the ability to play as anyone to fully complete the level. It becomes tedious at times as many of the levels have you constantly switching out characters because only Magneto can move magnetic objects or because only Sandman can traverse sand tunnels.In free roam you wander about, finding lose Gold Bricks, tokens and even helping Stan Lee who has somehow found himself in various predicaments around Manhattan, take part in racing challenges or fetch quest a lá Lord of the Rings. At first it seems like the map is littered with endless challenges and for most of my time playing I felt exhausted just looking at all the things scattered about on the map.The challenges also sometimes suffer from feeling uninspired. Most of them are just beating up bad guys, fetching something from the other side of town or escorting a lost cat to its owner. Thankfully each challenge has unique voice acting, so you're not hearing the same thing over and over again.I musn't forget about Manhattan, the open-world map you're given to explore. Swinging around from building to building as Spider-Man, rampaging through traffic as Hulk or rocketing across the sky as Iron Man is really fun and never really ends up feeling dull, given that so many characters have different ways of moving about. Even driving feels responsive and stranely enough handles better than many racing games where driving is the main focus.Though not big (certainly a bit smaller than Algonquin of Liberty City), Manhattan has been faithfully recreated. You can visit areas like Chinatown, Times Square, Harlem and the Financial District, each are designed in a way that makes them stand out from one another. You'll come across famous landmarks such as the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, Central Park and Columbus Circle, though the strange lack of Chrysler Building and United Nations Headquarters doesn't really detract from the island as a whole (perhaps there wasn't enough room, I don't know).Free roam also introduces some much needed changes with the most relieving of them being the inclusion of a mini-map, something Lego Batman 2 and Lord of the Rings sorely lacked. The ingame map itself is even an improvement, you can now tell which direction your character faces and whether a collectible or objective is below or above you. The best of all is that the map is actually readable and less cryptic in all regards. Fast Travel is present, making short of having to cross the entire city for an objective (not that it takes a long time anyway).Gone is the inventory system of Lego Lord of the Rings which means that you have to switch characters more often, leading to situations described above. I think the reason being is that it really wouldn't fit in the game all too well.Flying controls (in my opinion) has also been changed for the good as they are way more precise. Now It's easier to fly up onto a building and you won't overshoot it half the time. Still, the button for descending and turning off flight is the same, making some of the flying racing challenges unintentionally annoying. A step in the right direction anyhow.Pros:+Large roster of recognizable characters.+Hours of content.+Streamlined drop-in-and-out gameplay.+Humorous voice acting.Cons:-Repetitive puzzles and challenges.-Doesn't really do anything new.If you like Lego and Marvel (or if you know someone who's not really into video games) I highly recommend it. Play it solo, play it with a friend, it doesn't matter because it's hours of fun (even though it gets tedious at times)."
76561198043624834,Recommended,249130,10825080,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,Dr_Tengu,"I can't say I ""highly"" recommend the game, but it is quite enjoyable for what it's worth and the humor and various cameos help move along a very unpolished product.And I do mean unpolished: the controlls are a mess, one button has up to three functions simultaneously, the driving and flying control like bricks (heh), the physics are wonky as hell, and there's some very questionable design and balancing choices. Furthermore, the game is padded out like hell: New York city is a sizable sandbox with tons of things to do, but sadly a lot of the quests end up being basic point-A-to-Point-B-and-back fetch quests, the worst of all include you escorting people (has anyone ever said ""What this game needs is escort missions""? Anyone?) who are slower than you, can't get into vehicles, and routinely get stuck behind ankle-high pavement. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting and excessive use of puns is also very noticable.Still with me? Good, now here's why I actually do enjoy the game a lot. If you've ever played any of the previous LEGO titles, you'll know the basic outline of the game: Every mission has to be beaten once using a select group of characters, all of which have their own special abilities, and once you've beaten them you re-thread the stage with the ability to select any character you've unlocked and then search for hidden items and such. The game's abilities and heroes are varied and fun; there's amazing detail shown to every single cast member, most of whom have their own special animations for attacking and their own crosshair icon. Statistically speaking, your favorite Marvel character is somewhere in this game playable, and unlocking people is very fun. The level design is top notch, with every one forcing you to keep a keen eye out for hidden goodies and I never once found any particular puzzle to be annoying or obtuse. Finally, the music in the game is quite good, which took me for surprice. I'm particularly fond of the racing theme.Overall, it IS a good game, only that the seams are more visible than Hulk rampaging through a kindergarden. If you can forgive its many, many technicall fault you're bound to fall in love with a game that was clearly put together with lots of care."

I will only recommend this game for people with patience or who simply crave a tongue-ahd-cheek, low-key adventure.Story: GreatThe amount of creativity gone into structuring the crazy insane scenarios for these characters to endure is a charm amongst itself, and the tongue and cheek episodic style of the missions suits the Marvel Universe very well. All the characters are spot on in this adaptation. Spider-Man is a charming smart♥♥♥♥♥ Captain America is a cheesy boy scout, Dr. Doom is arrogant but intelligent, etc. My only complaint is that some of the missions don't add anything narratively, but this isn't the kind of game that's trying to tell a deep story. It's more about being lossed in the insanity and action of it all.Graphics: Appealing ""in places.""While the characters themselves are impressive, it’s the environments apart from New York City itself that really enrapture my attention. Levels with Lego contraptions embedded into them are the high point of the visual appeal for this game. Unfortunately, New York City itself isn't very impressive looking. Outside the park area and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, the city is not worth looking at.Gameplay: Simple but . . . .SIMPLEDon't expect this game to be challenging or engaging. People play Lego games to relax or just to enrapture themselves in a toy store like state of mind. I wouldn't call the puzzles ""PUZZLES."" The puzzles in this game are fairly straight forward and there is no requirement for the player to have to analyze or take into account a different perspective on the objective at hand. The Puzzles are more like Quick Time Events without the ""Quick"" part. And combat is . . . well what do you expect? Just press a button till they get hurt. Targeting is broken as ever and the circle reticle does nothing to improve the aiming in the game. Thank goodness for the auto lock feature in this game, otherwise there would be no way to beat some of the missions or challenges. Also, it still disappoints me that there is very few actual ""building"" gameplay in a game based around a property that's all about building. Shame on you Lego video games. I know non-Lego games that have more building gameplay than the games based around your product.Controls: TerribleOk this really is a breaking point for me. A game can be phenomenal, but poor controls can ruin the entire experience, and believe me these controls did for me. Flying feels too complicated for what it is. Imaging having to motivate a sleeping dog and the only way you can is if you inject them with rabies. That's how flight and sometimes walking feels. There's too big of a jump from slow movement to insanely fast movement, so precision is non-existent in this game. Also to note, often times some puzzles will  require the player to move objects with the control sticks and since the camera is always fixed during these situations, there were a multitude of times where I had to restart the entire mission because pieces would get stuck together and there was no way to reverse it. For a game that's not about challenge and aims to relax players, the controls are very frustrating at times that may even infuriate some people.Sound: Sound Effects = Meh, Music = Awesome!The sound effects are nothing to discuss. Sometimes they're there, sometimes they're not. The game gets very quiet at times that might be annoying or off-putting to some players. However, when the music plays, it really gets me pumped up. From simple quirky tunes to epic rifts that rival the movies' soundtracks, the soundtrack for this video game is definitely something to check out if you like fun, intense, or even quirky relaxing tunes.Final Verdict: Play if you wish.You will not miss out on anything in this game if you don't play it. Lego Marvels is fun, but it'll be only appealing to people who yearn for that classic, almost nostalgic feeling you'd get whenever you played with ""toys"" as a kid. Note, I said toys and not ""Legos."" This game will not give you the same fun, engaging feeling of building your own contraption or characters. There are a multitude of games out there that have actual construction and destruction gameplay over the Lego video games. If you wish to play a game based around the Lego building experience, I'd recommend Blockland, Boom Blox 1 or 2, Roblox, Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts or Robocraft. Otherwise, Lego Marvel Super Heroes is a good game to play if you just want to relax, lay back, and just enrapture yourself in childhood whimsy."

A fun challenging co-op game, that builds on the new LEGO tradition of creating LEGO counterparts to already established franchises, and doing it with the typical LEGO humor.The character roster and diversity is HUGE, the missions are immense and with high replay value (using different characters to unlock new things), leaving you and your son with something to do at all times, with mini quests, and unlockables that will keep you busy for days.  The game itself has great visuals and sound, the established standard LEGO playability on one of its best implementations. As usual, you have the option to customize your LEGO characters, and what is the best setting than a super hero game to do so?The game can obviously be played on single player, but where it shines is on co-op (just be sure to adjust the split screen mode to what is less confusing to you, as the dynamic split screen is not perfect).A must buy to parents that are looking for a fun, good action game packed with nice puzzles to play with their marvel fan sons."

The use of leitmotifs and overall scoring is clearly the best known and most successfull aspect of this game. The music is iconic and commonly associated with legos in general. one of the highlights of  LEGO Marvel Super Heroes' score is its ability to just cut out at times. It hightens the already abundant realism of the game. The choice of instruments is masterfull, it hightens the grittyness. Also for the time when this game came out those sort of melodies and instruments were unheard of in LEGO videogames. You wold have never heard anything of the sort in LEGO Starwars, but because of the leaps and bound in composition in this film, all LEGO now has that iconic sound to it."

Everything that game embodies is still in this one. The cool overworld, the incredibly large character selection, the puzzling... puzzles, and etc. Marvel is also my favorite franchise producers, from Spiderman to Ironman to Hulk and the X-men, they're all in this game. The overworld is probably my favorite part because it's almost like LEGO GTA. You can hijack civilian cars and drive them around into light posts and mailboxes, running over civilians (they just fall over), flying jet planes, and finding secrets. You can change into characters you unlocked at any time in the overworld too. I don't understand why I haven't played this game sooner. Something that may throw some people off though, is that this game is voice acted. Most LEGO games I've played make the characters do interpretive movements to let the player know what's happening.

I've played some LEGO Games before, they're enjoyable and all but this one is just so different. My Favorite Childhood bricks and some of the superheroes that I still read and love, combined in one game. = NERDGASM. I mean who doesn't love LEGO Bricks and Superheroes?LEGO Marvel Superheroes  is a probably one of the best LEGO Games out there and is obviously a great addition to the LEGO  Video Games Franchise. The Story is a mix of all of your classic Comic Book Story Lines, mixed with the Marvel Cinematic Universe twisted with the good ol' Lego slapstick humor, which is obviously great for kids, and some of the more mature audience to laugh at and enjoy.Everything is so good in this game, I've got 0 problems so far, animation is great, transitions are great, cut scenes are great, dialogues are great (Yes, classic LEGO puns are present.) The amount of characters are great! When you finish the main story mode, You still have so much to do, Like Collect Gold Bricks, Red Bricks, unlock more characters, unlock vehicles oh and you can wander and fly around a LEGOLIZED New York! (Manhattan for you Yankees.) With some of the real landmarks like The Times Square, The Empire State Building, and the Statue of Liberty! Which actually plays a big role to destroy you together with Magneto! Yes the STATUE OF LIBERTY! The Good old Big Apple landmarks with a Marvel Twist! The X-Mansion, Avengers Mansion, The Stark Tower, The Baxter Building, The OSCORP Tower, and the SHIELD Hellicarrier are present for you to enjoy and geek out on. Not just that, the Norse God of Lighting also gives you a tour of the great Asgard!Now the DLC Packs, Super Pack is definetely worth it for me, just to mention a few, it includes, The Classic Hawkeye, The Falcon, (Yes the White and Red Spandex.) The Symbiote Suit Spider-Man, and a lot more! The Asgard Pack is alright, If you love Thor and his Norse Mythology Goodness, its a good addition to your Character roster! I mean one reason to buy this DLC pack? Odin the All father and the The Warriors Three!If you've enjoyed the past LEGO Games, some of the classic and present Marvel Comics and Movies, this game is definetely a must buy, and its a great addition to your growing games library. I can't stop playing this game! IF they ever make a sequel for this game, I wish they add more characters and I hope they make the story longer incorporating all the characters that are actually present in the game.Not an ""innovative"" game but definetely an impressive one.HOWARD THE FREAKING DUCK AND THE HULK BUSTER ARMOR IS IN THE F*CKING GAME!

The game is of a decent length clocking in around 25+ hours depending on if you’re going from main mission to main mission or if you wish to explore and find all everything the game has to offer.The game offers a simple fighting mechanism where only two buttons are used in active combat, for advanced games this will feel mashy but we have to remember that this is a kid’s game.Game mechanism offers some puzzles throughout each mission where only selected characters can be used to complete the task, in main mission this is no problem as you are always given 2-3 characters to be able to complete the level, but you have to think a little when playing through the levels in Free mode so collect everything that a level has to offer.The game does however fall short some places where the play Is forced to “balance” over object or when combat takes place on a narrow field with water or clifts around, this often results in the characters very easily falling of the ledge.  This does not have real consequences in the game as you always have other characters and only is an annoyance to the player.The humor in the game is catered to the younger audience and will fall short for a more adult oriented crowd."

Smash your way through the levels, collect stuff and build stuff, maybe to solve a few easy puzzles. And like all other games you do hit a point were you get fed up of collecting stuff.  And changing from a transforming character like the Hulk can be a pain. But is it worth spending you cash on? Hell yes, especially on sale.This game, along with the Batman series benefits from the the fact that the story is not taken from the movie (ie it does not use sound bites). As a result you get a well scripted, entertaining plotline, which finds a way to blend together different Marvel characters in a way you won't find in the movies. Plus we get Clark Gregg voicing his character (it's also worth checking out some of the roles other cast members have played as well). There are plenty of side quests, many of which are quite fun, along with the ability to rob cars off people and drive them into stuff."

I experienced a glitch at the end of the Taking Liberties level while fighting Mastermind during coop play. I ended up exiting the level and replaying single player to move past it. The game would often crash when calling in a vehicle or changing characters. I drastically reduced my problems by reducing detail levels (there was a notice that my GPUs shaders were being reprogrammed when I reduced settings) of the video settings.The humor references the Marvel movies and can be a little over the head of my kids sometimes, but is never too rude.I did buy the 1st DLC as it gives you a few more characters/skins like classic Hawkeye and black-suit Spidey, but it's not essential.Pick up the base game and have a good time."

It is awsome and its in LEGO which means everything is awsome so you get it.My slightly longer review is that this is a great game with a lot of stuff to do and constatly fails to get boring. Each character is mostly unique with various abilities (and they let you play as COULSON) and the level design is great. It uses ideas from both the comics and movies but luckly never seems to fall to far in one direction. It is great and has a whole lot of cool stuff to do. Some charcters aren't focus on much such as Cyclops and Iceman who are only playable in one story level but you can still play as them around New York and in Free play.9.75 /10

The gameplay is very similar as all Lego games are so I will focus on the differences between the two.The first thing I found a welcome change from LOTR is the much more diverse abilties of the superheroes.  The different gameplay options added a lot of variety to the game.  You even have the ability to create custom heroes using different pieces of equipment to create your own set of powers.  While pretty limited it is still a nice addition.  In addition, all the heroes can run extra fast and many can fly, allowing you to move around much much faster than was possible in LOTR.  I always wanted the ability to call a horse while I was playing that, and here you don't need to.The other nice change I noticed was the writing.  While LOTR followed the movies quite closely and interjected the Lego humor into the existing story quite clumsily, Lego Marvel has an original story where the humor works much better.  While it's not going to win any awards for writing, it does work quite well and most of the voice acting is pretty good.Lego Marvel takes place in Manhattan in a fairly large open world.  This unfortunately makes the shortcomings of the aging game engine painfully obvious since the game stutters badly moving around the city, especially at the high speed the superheroes can move at.  The city itself is well-designed though and there is a lot of content to explore.One new problem introduced by this game is the flying controls which can be quite troublesome.  When flying at high speed if you try to change direction, the character will not turn at all but instead keep flying forward at the same speed until you release the thumbstick, no matter which direction you attempt to turn.  It is quite counterintuitive and takes a lot of getting used to.  Gaining elevation can also behave strangely with flying forward and then pulling up allowing you to climb many tims faster than just going up.If you are a fan of Marvel or Lego games, this is a solid title to pick up.  Make sure you have a gamepad to play with though as it has no mouse support."

Another is the character customization is a place of confusion and frustration.

,Recommended,249130,14928126,"Posted: 16 March, 2015",all,NayrSlayer,"As a lifelong fan of everything Lego, this game is simply yet another amazing addition to the Lego video game library. With the fun and kid friendly style along with some good natured humor, this game keeps introducing new game functions at every level and keeps you looking for the little special pieces hidden in every level.However, this game does pose a significant challenge to players as you might find yourself being broken into pieces while trying to figure out the proper way to defeat a boss or solve a puzzle. That being said, most aspects of the game are beaten through strategizing and performing a series of actions rather than quick reflexes, making it very simple to look up the solution online and execute it in game.Aside from the actual story missions, there is an expansive, open world to explore, dozens of super heros to unlock and play as, numerous mini-games hidden all across the city, and tons of fun collectibles. Needless to say, there is so much to do and discover in this game that you'll be busy for many hours.Pros:Straightforward and fun story missionsHuge open world environmentTons of playable characters (each with their own play style)A plethora of collectibles, mini-games, and secretsCons:Camera can shift in odd ways that can be a bit disorientingOccasional glitches in making a level unbeatable by not having certain items show up (happened to me in the fight against Loki and the giant robot)Overall:9/10One of my favorite Lego games out of the bunch due to all of the characters and open world environment. Definitely worth the money as you'll have numerous hours of fun with it. And like with all other things Lego: this game is perfect for all ages."

,Not Recommended,249130,16693938,"Posted: 25 June, 2015",all,StrangeOne101,"For a Lego game, I was slightly disappointed with it. The storyline is pretty weak overall and it's mostly just the bad guys stealing from the good guys and the good guys failing horribly at getting back at the bad guys.The story also was quite bland and had the same tone all the way through. I can't say I was ""captivated"" by it and kind of had to get myself to finish the rest of it. It did, however, get interesting when on the final chapter (Spoiler)Galactusappears and wants to try consume the earth. I wish they expanded on this more instead of leaving this to the very end, since you sort of get lost on what Dr Doom and everyone are actually trying to achieve. 4/10The other thing that annoyed me in this game was the lack of guide for the navigation. All the missions are all around New York, which you have to roam around in to actually do the missions. There are also no Tooltips when you go over the map, so you kind of have to explore and find out on your own to figure out what anything meant. 5/10Never the less, there are some great parts to this game. I felt characters were portrayed pretty good and a lot of them still had their amazing sense of humor. You even see deadpool between chapters, just casually watching on the side any not doing anything. You even see him steal a pizza from a pizza guy. Absolutely amazing. 8/10The mechanics were also pretty neat. You can swing anywhere you like as Spiderman so easily with his webs, which looks amazing but also makes navigating New York so much more fun. He even sticks to walls when you hit something. They also put so much effort into other characters, like Venom and Sandman. I loved how you could roam around as them, still be able to do absolutely everything but still retain that awesome feeling when you do it. 9/10Overall, I rate this game 6/10. Still fun, but quite disappointed in a lot areas of the game."

If you've not played a LEGO game before, but are into Marvel, you should probably look up some videos on exactly what the gameplay is like. I'll just give a quick summary of my thoughts on this one:If you've played a lego game before, the play style is mostly similar. However, the wide range of characters makes it much more interesting to play, from all walks of Marvel life, and with lots of different special abilities to make puzzles out of.The story is obviously aimed at a younger audience, but not to an unplayable level.The inclusion of a wide array of things to do in the 'hub', including side missions, is nice to see as it helps make the city seem a bit more 'alive'.This Lego game, unlike some others, actually has voice acting.

Although Batman 3 has the wide variety of characters and activities, the Marvel version just feels better.  Batman 3 feels forced whereas this feels like watching a well-made Marvel movie; action packed, intriguing story, and enough comedy to make it enjoyable for just about anyone."

There are many characters with varied superpowers, which are fun to unlock and try out. The missions are your standard Lego game affair, with charming cutscenes and plenty of collectables to go back for, but this one features a story that is not based on the movies. The open world of Manhattan felt a little sparse, it would have been cool to see some random occurences like robberies and muggings like other super-hero open world games have done. The flight controls are a little wonky, which make a few of the side challenges particularly un-fun, but overall it is an enjoyable experience."

,Recommended,249130,20608485,"Posted: 18 January, 2016",all,GameBlaze,"Lego Marvel Super Heroes is based on the amazing Marvel comics and Cinematic Universe movies. The story is simple, Dr. Doom wants to collect Cosmic Bricks that were lost by Silver Surfer when he was shot down by S.H.I.E.L.D. on a mission. So he hires many villains, such as Abomination, Magneto, and Venom. The Avengers, X-Men, and many street-level heroes team up to help take him down.Now that the story is taken care of, I can get into more of the gameplay aspects. Well first off, the controls are VERY wonky without a controller and take a lot of getting used to. New York City serves as an excelent hub for the game as well, for it is not very large, but has a lot of exploration, quests, and unlockables for such a small area. There are over a hundred characters, 250 gold bricks, and around 15 red bricks to collect, and it is a fun challenge to try and go for that 100% achievement. In short, I would recommend this game if, A), you are a fan of Marvel, B), you love Lego games, or C), you just want a fun game to relax and play around with."

This game felt like the comics I read growing up and had lots of humor and adorableness all over.The story was light and fun and entertaining and the problem solving was enjoyable without feeling overbearing or tedious.  The lack of voices actually made the storytelling unique and very fun...my very young niece was even engaged by them.  I still regularly replay this game...some excellent replay value and its still fun for just passing some time.The cast of playable characters was large and varied with many different notable franchises making appearances.

,Recommended,249130,26500351,"Posted: 9 November, 2016",all,Awesomov,"This is part of a series of many Lego games based on licensed material, like Star Wars and DC Comics before it. However, while those are all quality games, if you have to pick just one out of the whole lot, this ought to be the one. It's not only the best based on licensed material, it's one of the best Lego-based games ever.There are a wide variety of characters you can play as, each with their own abilities based on their actual powers, though there is a decent amount of overlap in terms of abilities. And, admittedly, once you gain certain characters, you'll generally mostly use those characters out of convenience (Super Skrull is a prime example). But the game has quite a bit of charm and personality going for it that makes playing all of these characters, and creating your own hero, worth the time to unlock and play as them all.Otherwise, what makes this one quite a ton of fun is there is a large city-wide hub, which is basically Manhattan, which you can just mess around with in between levels. It's like playing a more family-friendly Grand Theft Auto with famous super heroes. And there are plenty of neat secrets and puzzles both in the hub and within the levels and missions you take part in, loads of knicknacks for the taking, and despite some things being easy to obtain, it's always satisfying to obtain them.This, despite being one of the best Lego games out there, is not among the greatest games ever made, admittedly, but it is more than worth your time for being quite the fun diversion."

,Recommended,249130,33348798,Posted: 7 July,all,Gender Master Vodka,"Notes for this review: I am a third of the way through the story mode at this point. The original LEGO Star Wars was one of the first video games I ever played. I have played through all of the original LEGO Star Wars story mode, a good chunk of the LEGO Star Wars II story mode, and 100% of LEGO Indiana Jones.PROS:- Wide variety of characters with unique abilities- The usual LEGO gameplay that is just challenging enough- It's not based directly on any movies, so the plot is newCONS:- ""Open world"" setting -  I don't think it really works for LEGO games- At one point during a level, both characters needed to do something at the same time, but the other character wasn't doing it, so I had to go into 2-player mode and control both characters at once. From there I couldn't figure out how to get out of 2-player mode so I was stuck in splitscreen until the end of the level.- I've only had two sessions so far, but both times when I tried to exit the game it froze the game and my laptop. The only way to get out, since I couldn't open Task Manager, was to completely shut down my computer by holding down the power button.EDIT: For the second con, it turns out you actually have to switch to the other character if you need two characters to do something at the same time - I was used to the character doing it automatically in the Star Wars games. The point about not being able to get out of 2-player mode still stands, though."

,Recommended,249130,32014604,Posted: 28 May,all,painedforever,"I loved the LEGO Star Wars game (the one which the 6 Lucas movies). I enjoyed the LEGO Jurassic Park game. This one... I'm a bit ambivalent on. I haven't done a 100% on it yet, but I have run through the story and played a few side-missions.As with all of the LEGO games, Marvel Super Heroes is a ""smash blocks and collect tokens while running through a stage"" platformer. It's set in the Marvel Universe, but not in any particular version or movie. It does borrow a lot from the recent movies (up to Iron Man 3 and Guardians of the Galaxy, I think), but also contains the Fantastic Four and the X-Men (though not from their respective movies).The hub for the game is the SHIELD Helicarrier and the city of Manhattan. Not the entire thing, but the hub is not only broad, but also very vertical. It's a good job then, that there are a number of characters who can float or fly. There are a number of activities to unlock various blocks and characters, in addition to the usual story-mode/free play collect-a-thon.The story is nothing very special. I think I liked the story for Ultimate Alliance better. But it's the typical ""villains teaming up so good guys need to team-up"" story. Every stage has a big old boss fight in it, sort of a gimmick as opposed to a straight-up knock-about. The voice-acting carries the game more than the story, though the humour sometimes falls a little flat.Voices and sound are both top-notch. They got great voice-actors for Iron Man, Wolverine, Deadpool, Spider-Man, Hulk, Thor, Loki and Nick Fury... and the others aren't too bad. The music is thematically appropriate, though the hub-music tends to grate a bit.The graphics are pretty nice. I love the designs of the characters and Manhattan. The characters look too glossy and shiney in some of the cutscenes and that bothers me a bit. But aside from that, it looks pretty okay.There's a very good variety of heroes and villains in the game. The major Avengers are here, as are the Fantastic Four. There's a good selection of X-Men. Spider-Man, Deadpool and SHIELD are in there. From the other side, we have Dr. Doom, the Sinister Six, Galactus, the Brotherhood of Mutants, and various minions from Doom, AIM and Hydra. I think the main reason I got this game is because of all of the characters it has.I didn't enjoy playing the campaign quite as much as I enjoyed the other LEGO games, however, There have been way too many times that I couldn't figure out what I had to do or where I had to go to progress, because there was too much going on. All of the fights are puzzle fights, and so many of them would be full of ""You can't fight back until this guy tosses something at you"".There have also been various times in which my character would get stuck on geometry, usually because it seemed that the designers didn't realize I would wind up there when I flying, swinging, or being knocked about by an invulnerable enemy in a chaotic arena.Regarding the boss fights, it's also somewhat annoying when you're attempting to show the bad guy what-for, and you get swarmed by infinite minions. Fighting them isn't hard (even the ones who have powers or guns), but if you have to build something, and keep getting interrupted, it's very annoying.I know it sounds like I'm being very negative about LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, but it is a game that I'd hoped would be better than it is. As it stands, I'm still going to recommend it for having such a great, big sandbox with so much going on, but it's still not as good as the other LEGO games that I've played."

Not taking it self too serious with funny jokes and cutaways. Not to mention a lot of heros, villaians and anti-heros/villains are here. Iconic ones like iron man and magneto to less know ones like moon knight andThe story is quite generic but cutscenes and dialog are funny. The into cutscene is horrible though and feels out of place. Other than that its compelling till the very end.Combat simple but fun. Although I do think their should be combos rather than one button the addition of ranged combat, character transformations and combat finishers make it more complex and varied. The combat finishers are a prime example of staying true to their characteristics. The Thing for example will life up an enemy, throw him up in the air, try to catch him but ends up dropping him. This fits his clumsy natures.Puzzels: need certain superheros powers in order to overcome them which feels natural and stays true to their character. Some are easy enough and some make you think.Graphics: Good but with a few really bad textures in places. I would also have prefered the whole map to be made out of lego like buildings as it does feel a bit lazy.Some bad issues however: The map is horrible to use and does not explain any of the icons. Flying at first it horrible and even once you learn it, its a bit clunky still.One huge improvement needed: The world does not react. Yes in side missions and main story you feel like a hero/villain. In the free roam open world you dont. Playing as Venom, civilains should run away and cops should be called to attack you. Than a senitile should be called in to attack you. Where as if you a hero you should have to help out civilains and beat up villains. Then enough will set up traps. A HUGE MISSED OPPTUNITY and a big overlook imo.Collectibles: HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥A LOT.Overall: It stays true to the lego games of puzzles and simple combat but with the theme of powers changing how puzzels work and making combat more fun."

,Recommended,249130,32900745,Posted: 27 June,all,TheSocialNeko,"Lego Marvel Super HeroesI've wanted to get this game ever since it came out. Bit of a history lesson, not only do I love Marvel ComicsThough I do oppose some of their recent decisions, but I also love Lego, especially their video games. If anyone remembers the Lego Harry Potter Creator game on PC that came out in the late 90s, I loved playing that. I had a PlayStation 2 growing up, and I had pretty much every Lego game that was released on it. The Star Wars games, the Indiana Jones games, you name it. So, when I heard that a Lego game was finally going to be made with Marvel characters, you can bet I was excited. Problem was..I didn't have a console to play the game on. So, when I saw that the game was on sale during the Steam Summer Sale, along with pretty much every other Lego game, I knew I had to pick it up.The Technical SideI honestly don't have any issues with how the game looks, plays, or runs on my HP laptop. It's 2 years old or so, has Windows 10, and this game has run perfectly fine. I don't know what frame rate it's usually at, but I've never experienced any major frame drops.The Gameplay and StoryThe world of Lego Marvel is a strange blend of the comics universe, with elements of the Cinematic Universe mixed in. You have a classic looking Captain America, Wolverine, and Hulk, with an African American Nick Fury, Phil Coulson (voiced by Clark Gregg), and an Iron Man obviously inspired by Robert Downey Jr. And while I love the Marvel movies, I would have liked to see more comic-accurate versions of some of these characters.One thing I have to point out quickly is that the writing....it's incredibly cheesy. Sometimes, I really don't like it. But then other times, I find myself laughing at justhowcheesy they make it, and I know it's intentional.The game plays like what I assume most Lego games play like on PC, which isn't bad, not at all. I actually like the controls. And giving the player the option to remap controls is nice, in case there is a button that doesn't make sense, or is awkward to press. Like, maybe someone's running around and wants to press ` to attack, or q because it's near w.Do I like Lego Marvel Super Heroes?After a good 7 hours with the game, I can conclude thatyes, I have enjoyed Lego Marvel Super Heroes. Whether it's exploring New York City, or just running over Captain America with the Britmobile, this game has made me cringe, and laugh in pure enjoyment in a single session. That's impressive. If you have $6 to spare, and are looking for a puzzle/action/exploration game, and just happen to like Lego or Marvel, I'd say pick this up."

The combat and platforming are not on the easy side, however the puzzles made me stop and think for a few minuets on what I needed to do.Each level has story and free play mode, where you must find a massive amount of collectables. and between the levels is a open world map of New York (all in Lego of course)  with fun challenges for even more collectables and characters to unlock (I think there is about 150 characters to unlock in total)The puzzles and extras in the open world are marked on the map, so they aren't  hard to find, which encouraged me to unlock everything in the game.Overall a nice relaxing game which was very enjoyable.7/10"

It is so fun, seriously. It's closely rivalled by the original LEGO Star Wars games, but if you liked those I guarantee you will like this.The dialogue works great, the characters despite being overly exaggerated in normal LEGO style all work so well together. If you have almost no experience with Marvel, you'll see iconic people like Spider-Man. If you're a deep, deep Marvel fan, you'll see heroes that you had never dreamed of being in a game before due to how minor they were. There's over 150 characters! The side quests are all great, though at a few points confusing. The main quest is hilarious, and so so enjoyable.I couldn't recommend this title more."

,Not Recommended,249130,12914431,"Posted: 12 November, 2014",all,⸤Jλɪsπsʟɪм∪⸣⁶⁴,"A while back I had given this game a review. I love Lego's style, and I think it is enjoyable. Now, why I do not recommend this game. First off, it's just a puzzle game that attempts to also be an action game. The puzzles are repetitive and are far too fast paced. What I mean is, the puzzles are like as if they are just weak spots on a villian. They are uncreative. Every stage has a poorly built villian, with every stage also being about ""beating up the baddies."" With the combat, if it even is that, it's slow and again, nothing but weak spots or taking down an army of minions that do no damage, yet one shot and they are dead. It bores me. The only three modes areopen world, freeplay, and story. There are no multiplayer, arena/survival, or chasing modes. You only can use co-op, which I doubt on the PC is even relevant, which you either need two controllers or to share a keyboard. With open world, the only somewhat enjoyable mode and likely the prime focus, the puzzles are not uncreative. They are unique. It has collection, racing, taxi driving, taking down sentinels (which is the one villian that is not utter trash), arcade, secretive areas, air racing, and secret areaes. The vehicles are also pretty nice. My main complaint is that it doesn't feel like Lego. The buildings are realistic, The streets are realistic. It is unpleasing to the eye. Only props and characters are Lego. They propably spent more time on making realistic textures and graphics rather than if they were to make the whole map a conistent Lego universe. Also, in order to unlock certain items for open world mode, you have replay missions and collect items hidden around the map. It is only pleasing with open world, which was restricted and held back with making the game a Marvel game with a childish and repetitive story mode. The game would be no different if it had no Legos whatsoever, and that is what brought the game down the most. Another issue is keyboard and mouse support. As a PC gamer, I rarely use a controller, and intend not to. There is no mouse support whatsoever, keyboard support is terrible as well, since controls are bad and limited. Driving on both controller and keyboard is abysmal."

I should have all the badges for this game but it somehow didn't give me a few. But that still doesn't make me hate the game as a whole.Overall, the game is amazing! Its not about finishing the main story and you're done. There are a BUNCH of unlockable characters and items that will keep you playing the game!"
