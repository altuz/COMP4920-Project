Everything from small frigates to extremely large super carriers and battle cruisers. Sounds good? I thought it did. Watched a few videos, read the reviews, and thought I would give it a go anyway. The entire premise sounds fantastic, but the game has one really fatal flaw that makes it almost unplayable. I will explain further on.Positives+ Diverse amount of ships, creating strategy and counter strategy+ The environment looks really nice+ Particle effects look not too bad, explosions and lasers look pretty awesome in huge fleet battles+ Upgrading system for the fleet and your carrier allow for different playstyles+ Limited amount of ships that you can build, forcing you to choose the best ship for the job+ Music is pretty good, though the effects sound a little washed out+ Replayability is pretty good via skirmishing, even without multiplayerNeutral+/- Graphics could look slightly better, what I mean is if you zoom all the way in on a ship, it looks really pixelated. Not a huge deal, but the textures could have been better.+/- No grinding, and only a limited amount of scrap collected per mission make it hard to have a good fleet all the time. Upgrades can be resold for full value, but the upgrade phase is before the next mission, and without any kind of brief it is hard to anticipate what you would be facing.NegativesWhile there is only one negative point I can think of so far, it is the biggest and most glaring issue with this game. It take the playability of this game down to almost zero. All of the positives and neutrals do absolutely nothing to allieviate this one, and only one, negative point. Here it is,- Ship pathfinding and obstacle negotiation isnon-existentSeems like that would not be a huge deal? Well, this is a strategy game, in space, with spaceships. And the pathfinding is terrible, and they can't fly their way out of a wet paper bag. Multiple times I have failed a mission simply due to my ships not responding to a move order, or getting stuck in an infinite loop of ""bounce off wall and try to go through it again, only to bounce off of it"". A slight work around has been to activate the tactical pause, and micro manage each move and positioning ship by ship. Gets tedious and should not be that way.ConclusionOther than the pathfinding issue, this would be a great game. I simply cannot recommend this game, based only on that issue. If the devs release a patch to fix the pathfinding, then this would be a fantastic game.CategoryScoreGameplay1/5Graphics4/5Music & Sound4/5Replayability4/5Total                  13/20 = 65%Cannot RecommendTL;DRGame is pretty good, looks good, has decent replay value, music and sounds washed out a little, but major pathfinding issue makes itunplayablefor me.65%"

But there are problems and quite many of them.The ""maps"" in game look very nice, not just empty space which is nice... untill you need to navigate corridors and entrances on paralel levels... the rounting of the units can be bad, or worse  the larger ships tend to get caught, if not stuck, either slowed to a crawl or taking the bloody longest route to get anywhere. Makes one hope the maps were void of any obstacles.The combat areas are usually split to more than several sectors, which might sound good but hardly is. Areas are connected by wormholes and AI or player can go through em almost at will, reingforcing or attacking  dependending objectives.  The problems begin when you have to, divide ships and atention to 2, 3 or 4 locations. The ship limit is so appalling you really can have only one proper assault force and maintain effective ship type diversity, there are only few ships that that can churn out more cannon fodder and naturally (except the main carrier) those are pretty much out from your fighting force.To hold the areas and collect resources you need to capture certain positions in sectors, in these positions you build stations and upgrade from quite a few options, sounds again nice but overall the stations are quite apalling in deffence, only able to hold their ground to a lightest of assault without backup. Naturally there are several diffrent station types ranging from slowing, repairing, detecting and what not half of them are a damn waste... except perhaps the repair one. Why there had to be so many options? Could there have not bee more extensive upgrades instead of single useless specialition? Guess not.Basicly you are left with useless ""defense"" which should be protected, except you dont have the manpower really to do that if you are seriously thinking of pushing foward.Many of the units have special abilities, abilities you need to use due the limited fleet sizes, again sounds good but leads to way too much micromanagering even with a pause option in battle. Some or most the abilities hould have been made autotriggering , enabled or not bloody there at all.The missions are interesting and... warying... wich again should be good, but again it is done quite irritating way. Usually you start with everal sectors, usually full of opposition. Beside objectives attacking something, deffending, scanning object you need to maintain deffenses and counter enemy attacks that the ""deffensive stations"" rarely can handle. The objectives can be spread around on several diffrent sectors and at best have time limits... felt every second objective seems to be time limited or needing to protect something thats as sturdy as thin glass chalice.At best you need attack, deffend, scan, chase something down from several diffrent sectors, without manpower to cover half of it (never mentioning the rock, paper, scizors of the ship types yay!"", the production capacity to mantain pressure, or attention that would need to be divided between 2, 3 or 4 hotspots in diffrent sectors.Overall the the problem, the core problem is that the game tries to do too many things at the sametime, not doing half of them decently but still piling it all to the players plater all the same and thats where it falls appart.The game can hardly get out of the swamp of mediocrity but is it a bad game? No,  if not good one either.But... kinda makes one sad to see people comparing and even praising this to be a ""spiritual"" successor to the Homeworld series.Even with the fact ""time makes the memories golden"", one can say the original homeworld with its many bugs, and flaws was a good game, and so was the sequel. Comparing this rubbish to it is a damn crime againts the gilded memories of ""better times and games""."

Limited maps inspired by moba lanes with limited placement ""tower"" defense type buildings thrown in.To be honest pickings are slim right now in the rts genre unfortunately which inspired my purchase. The best thing I found about this is the price. My disappointment was slightly eased.Its pretty but like a great looking painting, you wish you could go there but when you reach out you realise its just 2d afterall and you can only look...Homeworld ruined pretty much any pleasure which might have been found here with comparisons but even standing on its own merits its weak.God knows how many years on and nothing has touched homeworld since.Just soulless.Edit - missed a word out.

,Not Recommended,249190,12205507,"Posted: 23 September, 2014",all,Benjin,"I'll expand upon this review later as I play through more of the game. The time that I've spent on it so far is merely a review of my first impression of the first 5 missions.Compared to other RTS games, this game doesn't really do anything that better games, such as Homeworld, haven't already brought to the table. The difficulty is pretty damn hard due to the way the AI are unfairly given so many units that are all thrown upon you. The game is not difficult because of an intelligent AI, but more because you have to face overwhelming numbers most of the time which sometimes leaves you feeling cheated when you're beaten.Example:In mission 2, you have to face roughly 50 units with your 12. The enemy are given battleships and frigates and many fighter squadrons. You only have a carrier, a battleship and 9 squadrons of fighters/bombers. You cannot build frigates yet, and frigates are good against fighters, so your fighters get mowed down while they try to hit the enemy fighter squadrons which counter your bombers. Even then, frigates are fairly decent against bombers, which doesn't make much sense. To win, you have to have your fleet at the center of the map where your turret's angle of fire (if you haven't built many turrets, you are screwed and have to restart; the trigger which spawns all of these units is unexpected and you won't have enough time to build the turrets to counter the threat) can deal the most damage on the incoming enemy units and allow you pick off the early incoming units one by one until the battleships arrive, rather than having a massive wall of enemy units focusing on your mission critical capital ships (if you lose either the carrier or battleship, you fail).To each mission, there is a specific formula to how you should beat each mission (e.g. you have to build/upgrade these units, attack these units at this time, use this special ability etc all in this order to win the mission, you will find it extremely hard to do it any other way). This then becomes a gruelling trial and error affair where you have to figure out the formula and win, which sometimes frustrates you to no end and limits your tactical options to win the mission. Some tactical choices you make earlier in the mission render the later part of the mission next to impossible to win, resulting in you having to go back and restart.This game looks pretty much your typical RTS game, but not what you'd entirely expect. It may not introduce many new things to the genre, but it does keep you on your toes and is unforgiving. This can be interesting, especially for people who want a challenge.I do not wish to give this a negative recommendation, I'd rather give it a neutral rating (some will hate it, some will love it, some will think it's just okay). But, since there is no such option, and I'd rather lean a little to the negative side, I have given it a negative recommendation. I'd suggest you wait for the eventual sale to come around if you wish to get this game, just incase you get disappointed with it."
76561197988077759,Recommended,249190,15410531,"Posted: 16 April, 2015",all,danny_maland,"""Ancient Space"" is a really decent entry into the space RTS genre, which (very refreshingly) gets away from the ironically boring routine of just having to be fast, fast, FAST!Indeed, the game pretty much goes in the opposite direction. Many missions are downright...contemplative in pacing. However, this isn't to say that there aren't some pulse-pounding moments where you have to think quickly. Indeed, if you forget that you can ""get on the gas,"" you probably won't complete all the missions.Going along with the previous paragraph, I'm very pleased to say that this title emphasizes giving things thought, especially in terms of figuring out what fleet configuration works for you. Frantic micromanagement really isn't the order of the day, although some micromanagement helps you get the most out of your units. The friendly ship AI isn't brilliant, but it's good enough that you can often let them make a number of decisions themselves. This emphasis on strategy (as opposed to hotkey mashing) even applies to those moments where you can't dawdle: You have to recognize what's going on and react swiftly but deliberately, whether it's proceeding with a certain kind of build or just running away.No, the game doesn't reach ""Homeworld-franchise"" territory. The scale of the game is too limited for that, both in the story and the way the game plays. ""Ancient Space"" is really a number of interconnected, constrained arenas that do become relatively easy to predict. (At the same time, I have to give a nod to the developers choosing a workable and recognizable mechanic, and then sticking with it consistently.) Also, this isn't a game about battles with tens upon tens of ships. Resources tend to be pretty thin, though steady, and your unit cap never goes much beyond 20. Unlike in other offerings, you're simply prevented from being able to ""overwhelm"" the enemy - and a person might argue that this helps to keep things interesting.On the story side, the scope of the narrative is surprisingly human-scale. This does allow for some interesting intrigue and a pretty decent plot-twist, but it doesn't quite fire the imagination like a ""Homeworld"" game might. ""Sprawling"" and ""epic"" just don't describe the way ""Ancient Space"" feels, and sprawling epicness is what's required for a ""Homeworld"" experience. There has to be a confluence of visual style, musical depth, and narrative context that conveys an almost mystical sense of size. This game doesn't get to that point, and it may be that it just wasn't meant to. That is to say that ""Ancient Space"" isn't a bad setpiece at all. It's just that the metaphorical walls aren't very far apart.There are some ""mechanical"" errors to be found. I had some moments where ships would infuriatingly fail to pathfind, and perhaps connected with that, I had a couple of occasions where ships would just halt for no apparent reason.But those are only little dings. ""Ancient Space"" is a good game, and definitely worth a playthrough. It seems to have been crafted well, and it scratches the RTS itch in a slightly different way than other contenders in the genre. I say, ""Good On Ya"" to CreativeForge for putting this thing together. I enjoyed it."

A lot of people are comparing this game to HomeWorld, but that is an unfair comparison as you are dealing with apples and oranges.Homeworld was great for what it offered. Massive fleet battles, graphics that were amazing for their time. A compelling story.Ancient Space didn't try to copy Homeworld.PROS :The voice acting as has been stated by other reviewers are great. The story is plausible and pallatable in the same way Nexus: The Juptier Incident had a fresh spin on the old space genre.The level of detail on the ships is great. Perhaps, because I do have a good video card, I can play it on max settings and the detail really shines.The way you control your ships is intuitive and I felt the learning curve was negligible.The ""hero commanders"" that are activated via the interface that can cast spells or debuffs(shields, more armor, more attack, enemy is more vulnerable, and so on) is a nice addition.Having stationary platforms that help you crawl is a creative and fun idea. Has a small Command & Conquer feel to it.CONS :As some have mentioned, the graphical requirements are pretty high. People are having performance issues. I am not one of them.The AI. It seems like waves of enemies continue to come your way. That's not so bad, but the game doesnt teach you that you basically just set up your units in specific areas of interest, following the rock paper scissor approach depending on what the enemy is throwing at you. You dont tell your ships what to attack as much as tell them where to be, ready for an attack. And when you get swarmed, you can issue orders to target fire on a specific ship. Point is, its more like moving chess pieces into position, and then using it, than just go and attack this target the way Homeworld did it.I think this is a great game, relatively speaking. I hope that future projects come to fruition as a result of Ancient Space."

The maps have obstacles that you can't go over or under so it might as well be a two dimensional map.Its actually about controling teritory by capturing key points and is not really a fleet combat game. It has more in common with Company Of Heros than any 3D space game.Having said that, its not a terrible game for 20 bucks. Its just not quite as advertised. I played a few missions and had a bit of fun but mostly it just made me want to play Homeworld again."

Now I can finally enjoy it.The game is good, and the scenario is simple but fun.  Sure, it's not on the level of Homeworld, or Nexus-TJI, but up to now I enjoy the game.There are a few cons, though, but nothing that a few patches can't solve.  Here are some of main issues I have:-The main one would be the camera being unable to zoom-out enough to have a full view of the battle.  Seriously, they (the creators) should work on that, as it makes seriously hinder the gameplay.-Ship movement sometimes seems erratic:  ships get caught into the megastructures (or into each others), and it can be quite tedious to direct them waypoint by waypoint. (then again, it might be better if the camera could zoom out far enough)-3D movement is not explained in the tutorial or in the control menu. (Either that or I was really distracted when playing the tutorial).  It took me quite a while to figure it out. (""g"" to summon movement disk, then ""left ctrl"" to ajust altitude, btw)  It is also somewhat buggy, and I often have to give the order twice.Outside of those few points, which are quite easy to deal with once you get used to the game, I have no complains at all about the game."

Well there is a menu button which is called ""Skirmish"" but behind that are just 3 maps with missions attached to it, like a horde mode for example.Pros:+nice graphics+nice sound+difficult campaign+small but interesting map designCons:-no skirmish mode-not very innovative/deep mechanics-pathfinding is a bit edgyOverall I would give it a neutral rating mostly because of the missing skirmish mode."
,Recommended,249190,12411232,"Posted: 8 October, 2014",all,PapaKarlo,"First of all, game strikes out on the whole ""space fleet battle"" concept, that's cherished by many homeworld fans. It's more like Starcraft with ships instead of marines. Maps are full-3D and filled with gigantic space objects you have to fly around but despite stunning looks that doesn't affect battles since ships don't have weak zones or blind spots to exploit with different attack angles.So we've got a very basic space-themed story-oriented RTS with nice visuals, fleet upgrading between missions, battles on multiple maps at the same time (when ""sectors"" aren't used as simple map-extender) and very interesting voice acting, where characters keep themselves forcibly calm and professional that transfers their stress and despair surprisingly good.Biggest issue I got so far is poor performance on my gtx670. I noticed drops to 20fps in some large battles and it made me consider giving it a negative review. Overall it keeps framerate on the reasonable level and judging by the forum that's my personal issues that won't necessarily happen to others.The game also lacks basic skirmish mode and any form of multiplayer hence replayability is a bit shallow, that may be a dealbreaker for many people.However, if you are fan of space-themed games, this one could satisfy you. It's got solid story, nice fleet-customization and overall good gameplay."

This is compounded by very poor pathfinding.  And then on top of that, the levels are inexplicable.I got as far as a mission, where you activate the warpgate deep in enemy space.  All of my best fights so far have been pretty much taking EVERYTHING along with me, leaving a trail of turrets in my wake and sieging enemy turrets.  Not terrible, really.And then this mission.  It splits your forces, in an idiotic way, ON AN ESCORT MISSION, and then throws more DPS at the second half than you can handle.  So you have an idiotic escort train that stems straight into enemy turrets, before you can do anything about them.  And you're AT the production limit, so you can't even make more units to handle the split.  And then a large unit steams in, which none of the remote units have the weapons to handle."

Things like: formations going totally crazy when you send them in a attack run or even a certain way. So expect a lot of micro management to safe yourself from rage.They also make comparisons with Homeworld, but expect more a Command and Conquer 4...Mainly because you cant harvest and focus on zone control.

The game play is let down with the z plane movement (up and down) the ships can move in this plane but you cannot command them to which causes the ships to get stuck on obstacles when the only way to procceed is a passage lower or higher than the ships current position.

First off, for a game set in 3 dimensional space there is no Z axis!  Battles predominantly revolve around rock/paper/scissors style ship weapons and resource generation is per tick, based on owning fixed points on the map.I enjoyed it but I was disappointed there wasn't more complexity ala homeworld."

,Recommended,249190,12297757,"Posted: 29 September, 2014",all,NeoG,"The Story, Voice, Music and overall ambiency is in my opinion, very well done. I like the way they used ""ingamestoryreasons"" to justify enclosed places and the use of buildings, which can be customized to heal, or shoot a specific damage type, or support, or whatever, like tower defense.With respect to the main gameplay mechanic - ship combat - I think it resembles much Nexus, but it is done in a more micro-intense matter, because you have to SPACEBAR-pause every few seconds to allocate a power, swap repairs, spawn a replacement unit, or issue new orders. This game is thus not really real time strategy but more real time tactics, like ground control, with some Z-axis movement to call it 3D.Personally, the gameplay is fun and challenging even on the easier settings, and must be downright nightmare ragemode on the hardest settings.With respect to the RPG elements... Depending on objectives you accomplish (if you even can), you receive some rewards like additional superpower (from officers), or additional secret officers. Also by collecting the yellow anomalies (which is IMHO mandatory) you gain powerups like extra resources, or materials for upgrading the fleet/carrier at the start of each mission.My only wish was that customization had been given more freedom because now you can only customize a hull by selecing between 3 or 4 narrow options like +1 armor, or +1 XL damage or +20 speed.Customization wrt to the mothership (carrier) is much more free, and you can choose between an offensive or defensive version that have advantages and disavantages. I have run with the Defensive one because it gives more resources per second, and you can build on its advantages by selecting from like 40 different upgrades, or round it out to your desire.Now my main issue with this game is not even the common (like once every 6 hours) crashes, which is understandable for a very small company product, but on the choice of the engine and the way the map layouts railroad and constrict you. I know you made the game good and adapted it to work in these constraints but I'd like to think the game would have come out better if made to work in a more open envronment, specially since in some of the missiong that are really tight, camera positioning is a pain in the butt and very frustrating not being able to see clearly whats on the area and being unable to zoom out, or worse, having to look from the bottom up (this is a problem because there is a definite up/down layout and you sort of need to be able to look from the top down).TL;DR: This game is definetly worth $20, and if you liked ground control, homeworld 1 or nexus jupiter incident, go for it.

It has a strong strategic and tactical take (think rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard with a few units having abilities that can crush those who are supposed to beat them some of the time), not particularly ""lanes"" like some have said after the first couple missions. The plot is original as far as I know:Expedition funded to investigate growing nebula and previous fleet, finds aliens who attack on sight but turn out to be clones of more peaceful Scythe who have been themselves attacked and experimented upon by the large group/corporation that funded both expeditions in the first place , who then try to kill the second expedition.My main issue was the graphics, this was the first time on this computer I had to lower the setting, and by that I mean ALL the way down.Partly because there are so few decent space games being made anymore, I would recommend it. 8/10Oh, and I never figured out who the girl on the game image is supposed to be. 10/10 for mystery ;)"

I enjoyed the diversity of units, the missions felt at the right pace and were varied enough to stay interesting. The unit types seemed well thought out and provide a variety of different ways of completing missions. Perhaps one of my favourite things is that the steam achievement system was put to good use, most achievements were rewarded for completing missions in a different way which made you play differently instead of always spamming the same ships.My only potential gripe with the game is that the first mission is undoubtedly the hardest and then the difficulty curve drops rapidly. Other than that this was a game that kept me playing and I think I will play the campaign again on the hardest difficulty."

Medium, which consists of corvette or Frigate like space craft.  Large, which has cruiser size space craft.

Maps are split into sectors linked by warp gates and sectors are again split into multiple, well, for a lack of a better word, areas. It is possible to build structures only in those areas and only at limited locations (typically 2-3 per area, less or more possible). You tend to adopt a ""attack and build strategy"", attacking the next area, building up its defences (structures also help to extend your population cap). This gives the game a relatively leasurely pace, where you usually have time to plan on you next move. Add active pause and you get the deal. This is general flow broken up by some timed missions, where rushing past an area is important. In general, building is only ever to support your fleet. Your carrier(s) are the actual center of the game.If you are into such games, you will like Ancient Space.Your ships have special abilities with a cooldown and using them at the right point (note again: active pause) against the right parts of the enemy armada is quite important.Pro:- closed quarter strategy- takes a more slow approach (minus those missions when it doesn't), but there are still pitched battles.- graphics are decent, the space backdrops and missions are nice.Cons:- The multi-sector approach takes getting used to, especially on those missions where your fleet needs to be split between sectors.- The micromanagement is limited to use of abilties. The rest is more or less melee-range fleet battle, i.e. a mess.- Would you be able to zoom in, you would miss details on the ships. But you cannot zoom in that far.- Fleet customization is limited. The fleet upgrades DO have an effect, but they don't necessarily feel immediately effective.-  The space battles feel a little lackluster.Still, I'd like to see more from this universe, possibly with more customization options, a more extensive campaign with more backstore and exploration."

The units strength and pro/cons pan out nicley. the only complaint i have is that its strange to see just how long the AI units dont die in a dog fight with my fully upgraded units. I do have a recommendation though: More content/DLC. I personally like the pirates faction so i recommend a Pirate Carrier. I personally would pay to have a campaign or skirmish in which i make sharks and cutlasses by the load. Now i understand desinging the ship might be difficult, but i think certain powers such as assualt squad (my favorite), field repairs, and either a photon cannon/nuke will suffice. The last power should be pirate specific: Scavenger. Scavenger is like their own version of war factory but instantly converts all nearby dead enemies into instant pirate ships( if not enough pop then just grey ships). Repairs could be called something like Jury Rigging or whatever. Anyway great game, fun, and needs an expansion. Please comment below in a respectufl manner."

Some games are looking to be a quick fun experience, why not just push through and be as amazing as many people want it to be. but i mean what do i know about making games, I've been playing them for only 15 years, sorry just a little upset because it could have been a space game better than Star Wars Empire at War, but SW better because it has alot of replayability not only having a REAL skirmish mode but a galactic conquest mode (campaign's pretty much gc with specific missions).I like the game for it's variety of ships tactical combat and epic sound track, but let me digress, this games variety of ships also plays as the games minor weakness. you have to capture points on the map to be able to increase ship population, and we're talking about a starting pop of like 9 or 10 when ships can take up 1 to 3 slots. Your not going to have a massive strike fleet comparable to Mass Effet 3's basically or the Empire's when general says his famous line ""IT'S A TRAP!!"". I mention this cause I'm quite use to large fleets in my space rts games.Balancing is a bit off, like in Sins of a solar empire fighters feel almost useless, Fighters don't seem to be fast strike craft but flying fodder only to be built when bombers seem to pose a threat and then destroyed later on. I feel if fighers are so vulnerable why not increase their speed or maybe let then dock in the mothership.... I mean it is a mothership.let get back on track, you need a fairly powerful machine to run this with graphics on high, the story is ok letting you upgrade your ships and use officers to boost combat capabilities, ship designs are unique and unlike any ships i ever seen, like I said before the sound track is amazing it will have strap your self to the bow of you ship and give the finger to the universe as you slowly ascend towards epicness.... ok maybe not all that but it really is good. It offers a challenge on low difficulties making it a good game for those who want to flex those brain cells, the background is stunning and effects are nicely done.

All the icons are more or less identical, and you have to keep clicking through your armada until you find the one you're looking for. Some interesting concepts, but it's really far away to even match the essence of the Homeworld games. The game lacks any feeling of maneuvering ""real"" spaceships. There's no inertia, vector thrusting, or even moving parts like cannons. The ships just flip around with no inertia and start moving towards their destination. And ion beams and lasers don't even emerge from the space vessels themselves. It's fun to play a few of hours, but then you get bored, and just select all your spaceships and right click the enemy to get it over with. Would never buy it at full price.

Instead of comparing this title to the 1st Homeworld, a better comparison would be Cataclysm or Homeworld 2 due to very strict unit caps.This might seem like a horrible thing, but it actually is a saving grace for this game. Each and every single ship so far has some sort of special ability (sometimes two) which can be triggered at specific times for great effect. The more ships you add from the current values when having this variety in individual ships creates a micromanagement hell. It strikes an excellent balance between fleet size and interactivity of each type of ship.This game has its problems for sure, but if you're looking for that Homeworld kick, you will find it here.

Onto the bad parts.The unit cap is frankly ridiculously low and you have to micromanage quite a few units. For a game that is supposed to be emulating parts of Homeworld it tends to throw you into the storyline and universe rather than introduce you to it (yeah sue me, but can't deny Homeworld series did actually have a good story). You'll spend more time paused and zoomed out than anything else which means you aren't really wow'd by the scale, combat or environement.Worth it for a couple of quid but nothing more.

It's a fairly old school experience that reminded me of the original StarCraft and the old Dune games, but while it's not especially innovative, it's not blindly clinging to the past, either, and it has enough modern ideas and mission diversity to not feel like retread of old games. It's an homage to the RTS greats of the past, but not an attempt to ape them.The story is pretty strong -- though suffering slightly due to technical limitations -- and the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard.

The lone drone sitting in front of me, selected the view just pans again....lost interest.  Gaming companies need to dumb down their games on the UI front or make the tutorials more friendly by explaining exactly what it is your are doing, not following back on standard WASD keys to explain it all (example, WASD makes some units in games move left/right/forward/backward but other games also use WASD to look up on flat planes and yet other games use finer controller of a seperate component to spin faster then Ancient space...which does nothing but spin point of view while facing in one direction - step forward, step back, step forward right, step forward left...and my complaint about this game was nothing changes)"

Build bases explore and expand.  But it's really just these small arena like areas you can't leave you can just warp to another small arena like area.  It's almost like island hoping in space.   You can't do another other then in these setup areas.  This really limits that stategic componant of the game leaving it feeling very bland for my tastes.  I would of played more but it was too boring to continue to play.  I could see some people liking this style of game as it's mostly focused on combat and not expantion and building.  I'd give it 5/10 not a bad game bug wise just not for me.

Several parts of this game are best described as 'annoying'.  The near silent ships (much moreso than homeworld), the level design (endless reinforcements for the enemy thus far, plus a buggy skirmish level), the incredible slowness of every ship, including fighters, the weapon discharges that appear out of nowhere, with no effects or moving turret (only applies to some of the ships), the halfhearted RTS control/command based on +1 defense rather than something real (homeworld 1 geometric formations that affected position->results, not +1 attributes).The story might be good - can't say yet.Don't buy - yet, at least.

The hull-vulnerability mechanic dominates the gameplay so much athat it really is the only aspect of your ships which matters, and on skirmish (as well as most of campaign) the game is not truly 3D. That said, the campaign mode is genuinley challenging. What really spoils it for me however, is the claim that there would be a big mystery to solve and a gripping story. The story was mostly flat, and the characters were not compelling. Ultimatley, campaign mode will leave you feeling like a right clever-clogs upon every little sucess, but i doubt you will have much fun."

This game is nothing like Homeworld. It is mostly maneuvering a small number of ships around environmental obstacles.The AI in this game is pretty questionable. Say I encounter a group of enemy stations that do nothing but murder light units. What anybody would do is keep the fighters away and bring in the heavy guns. Well the fighters see a party going on and will join it and get ripped to shreds.It also takes a lot of work to get big ships through the walls that are everywhere. I have lost my carriers multiple times while trying to retreat to a repair station and having it just hump a wall to its death.The game also gives you a camera that can do a 360* view. This is completely unnecessary in this game due to the fact that you will only be looking down. This is another place that completely differed from Homeworld: The Homeworld levels were huge while the maps in this game are not only small, but the camera has to stay within a small bubble within the map as well."

Some might say that's too short to draw a conclusion but I have already run into enough disappointment with this game that I've lost interest in it.  I'll break it down into pros and cons:Pros:  The graphics are good and the backdrops look great.  The voice acting is pretty decent as well.  I also thought the soundtrack was strong.  The ship models look good and the moving hardpoints are a nice touch.Cons:  The ""movement"" of the ships, for some reason I cannot quite put my finger on, just does not seem right.  It definitely feels more Sins of a Solar Empire than Homeworld to me.  As a absolutely HUGE Homeworld fan (one of my favorite game series of all time) I was not impressed with this game.  Another big disappointment is the explosions.  In a game like this they should really make the explosions feel powerful and awesome and this game fails tremendously in that reguard.  Large captial ships explode extremely quickly and with a visual and auditory fidelity not up to par with Homeworld 2, a game 11 years its senior.  In Homeworld 2 when a captial ship was destroyed it was EPIC.  In this game it's forgettable.  Weapon effects are largely in the same boat... just underwhelming and almost immediately boring.  Another complaint was that I felt largely underprepared for the first mission following the training scenarios.  The first mission throws several objectives at you and immediately drops you in combat.Overall I'd say that while I respect the intentions of the developer and almost always welcome a sci-fi/space oriented game I just cannot give this game my recommendation.  A few strong aspects are completely overwhelmed by multiple negative ones."
