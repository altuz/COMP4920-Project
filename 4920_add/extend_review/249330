She was a Cheepy so I didn't have high expectations. Popan was probably 3 days old when her parents died in an unfortunate ambush on my complex. I had a ton of other tenants, so I didn't see the harm in waiting for her to grow up. Somehow, she never became in debt. This ♥♥♥♥ing baby was paying the rent. She grew up to be a total badass. She would single-handedly wipe out entire waves of enemies without breaking a sweat.Popan is obviously popular and well-known throughout the land, she easily finds herself a guy to shack up with. He's weak and dim-witted; a farmer named Peecone that watches tv 90% of the time that he's home. It doesn't slow Popan down though, she easily slays the first main quest adventurer all by herself while all the other tenants are at work. She returns immediately and has victory ""pillow-talking"" and immediately has the child they have been trying so hard to have. A girl named Chaan, that is impossibly strong as well. Popan and Chaan were ♥♥♥♥ing ruthless, the perfect mother-daughter duo. Then Peecone stops paying rent, or so I assume, as I thought the world of those two divas but not so highly of farmer Peecone. I keep lowering the rent hoping they'll stay, I evict Peecone hoping it will fix the problem. It helps! They are back in the green in no time and happily tending their garden and watching tv together. Then it all goes down hill again. Popan robs the cradle with her next man, the neighbor boy, Pyo, not much older than her daughter moves in. Things get tense. Chaan was the one that wanted the damn Love Balloon and yet her mother was the one to snatch up a mate. Chaan is unemployed but barely comes home. Popan and Pyo are having pillowtalk near constantly. Twice I found Chaan begrudgingly lifting weights while the two love birds pillowtalk all night, draining the life out of her having to deal with it.Then tragedy struck. Being the only one home at the time of the ambush, Pyo the live-in boyfriend was struck down. Despite her envy, Chaan became increasingly more withdrawn, very rarely going out for fun or even job interviews. Popan also began getting increasingly more gloomy and soon they were once again behind on rent, once again because of a guy. In fear of losing my glorious lady warriors, I lowered the rent as much as I could stand but their grief had drained not only their livelihood, but also apparently their bank accounts because the two ♥♥♥♥♥es ran out on me in the middle of the night.11/10 would collect rent from orphan babies again"

I'd say tower defence (which is not a perfect description of the game, but it is fairly close) is one of my least enjoyed genres. Unholy Heights is something special though.Unholy Heights gets me far more invested in the morality of my actions than pretty much any other game. In a game like Fable which toutes its morality focused gameplay, I will just shrug off the ultimatums. ""Will you let most of the kingdom die?!"" Yeah; they were all carbon copies of each other anyway. ""Will you let your beloved get killed by the evil guy?!"" Yeah... her hair is kinda weird.But this game...I have some families that I accidently let the parents die, and now the child doesn't have enough money to pay the rent, but I feel so bad that I let her keep her room for free as a means of apologizing for her loss.And another family which has been falling behind on rent, but I don't want to kick them out because they just had a kid.And another family that keeps telling me to change the wallpaper back and forth and they're great at defending the place but I just can't stand their implied bickering, so I send them out as soon as there's an assault with the hopes that one of them will perish and I can finally either leave the room with smutty wall paper or plain wall paper..."

Sure build your tower, level up, stock better weapons to defend agains stronger enemies... la di da.Only a few games in that genre manage to really stand out and - congratulations to Unholy Heights - this is one of them.It's not you classic tower defense game, but it still fits the genre somehow, weird but true.In the game you're the landlord of a motel where instead of towers your defenses are your inhabitants, but there's an other twist.Towers don't just walk out on you or get scared, your renters do.It's really annoying when you've leveld up your renter and once he has a family he decides to run out on you, 'cause he's afraid of the villagers who attack the motel. It's really, really, really annoying, but also such fun, since it keeps you on your toes.A lot of tower defense game still follow the old set-it-and-forget-it principle, so you spend most of an attack just watching the masterpiece you've build do all the work, with little interaction required from you. Unholy Heights is different, if you just lean back an expect your renters to defend the motel without you, you'll pretty soon run out of money (villagesr not only kill your monsters, but also steal your money once they've reached the upper level of the motel) and renters.I'd totally recommend this to any fan of tower defense games, since it's something new and not the same-old-same-old, plus it's also a game for people who don't acutally like tower defense games; those kind of people won't even know they're playing a TD ;-)"
,Recommended,249330,32278687,Posted: 8 June,all,dropxofxpoison,"Unholy Heightsis all right. I wouldn't say it's the most amazing game out there, but it's good for a few hours of fun (or as many hours as it takes you to finish all the achievements, if that's your thing). The graphics are cute, and the tenants are interesting and quirky. You can upgrade and customize your apartments to give your tenants better living arrangements. You might experience some sadness or anger depending on how your spoiled tenants treat you in return, or you might even pity them when you momentarily forget you're supposed to be building Satan's army and that the weaker monsters inevitably need to make room for the stronger ones as you progress.The biggest con is that it doesn't have much replayability. After you've played for a few hours, that's pretty much the entirety of the game. The rest of it is, as I said before, just grinding for missing achievements, should you be interested in that sort of thing. (Clearly, I was, as you can see by my hours on record.)However, considering the fact that the game's full price is $3.99, instead of, say, $9.99, I do respect the developer. It's definitely a fair price. I don't regret this purchase, but I also don't see myself ever re-installing it in the future now that I've completed it."

The game starts in windowed mode and has borderless edges.  There is an option for Fullscreen.  There’s no Subtitles or Colorblind Mode in the options.  There’s also no voice acting so subtitles are unneeded.  Colorblind mode would help as some quests are color coded according to tutorial.Game play is very.point and click and I really couldn’t make it playable with onscreen keyboard.

I gave it a try and soon I dumped an entire afternoon into it.The goal is to fend off a series of invaders and ""grow"" your monster occupants while doing so. Despite the casual friendly vibe, its a heavily micro'ed type of gameplay. Losing a monster can be devastating to your lineup early on.I admittedly never branched off much into another style once I found monsters I liked and what worked, but there are many different ways to play. Certain monsters are incompatible with each other, so its worth another play-through to experiment with the ""Free Battle"" and different strategies.Good challenge, very cheap, recommended."

The game is widescreen only and at low resolution, though it looks fine for what it is and it plays fine on my 4:3 monitor too.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an enjoyable time consuming game."
,Not Recommended,249330,32914008,Posted: 27 June,all,chaser,"Well to start off, I wanna say some nice things about Unholy Heights.The art and presentation is great. Very charming characters and pleasant, chirpy music make for a good first impression to the game. It's also a reasonable price point considering how many hours you can get out of it, but with that said I want to list why I'm not that impressed with Unholy Heights.The actual gameplay is painfully repetitive, tower defense aspect of the game is VERY casual and one-dimensional and the management aspect is extremely boring after you do it for a couple hours. I like the quirkiness of the monsters but not so much that I wanna buy the same few things over and over each time I get a new tenant of that type. Maybe I'm just not that big a fan of simulation/management gameplay but I also think it feels kinda tacked on, as if it were to pad the length or give you something to do during downtime between quests.As much as I enjoy the presentation of Unholy Heights, I don't find the gameplay engaging or fun in any meaningful way. It's very casual, so if that's all you want and you really like what you see, you'll probably love it. I know there's a fair bit more content than what I got out of it, but nothing that will change how mundane and repetitive each quest is.I think that's another thing about the ""hotel management"" aspect of it, you're stuck to this one setting and battles happen almost the exact same way each time. Most great tower defense games have ever-changing levels and progression system/unlocks. Unholy Heights just has ""buy this ice-cream a fridge, buy this devil a heater"". It wears pretty thin after a while."

It has some fun music, but it kinda gets old when there's only one track playing all throughout the game. It's got a delightful aesthetic. It's also fun in short bursts, and is a fun, simple game.Now...It's a tad too simple. And the combat relies on your creatures actually being there, which sometimes they are not, and you're just screwed. And it doesn't even tell you in anyway that they are out or not unless you look into the rooms, which is incredibly inconvenient. Not to mention I think it's impossible when an attack is happening. So, click away and hope they are there. There is a bit of micro managing you can do whilst in combat, but not incredibly so. You can't go full Star Craft, kiting your foes to death without taking any damage. Also, the pacing just seems a bit off. I'm not sure what it is about it. Could be the health regen is incredibly slow, basically meaning you just have to sit there waiting before taking quests...doing nothing... I'm not too sureIt is fun.

Monsters are cute and presentation is acceptably straightforward. The strategy system is very arbitrary and cumbersome. Controlling your monsters in battle can be frustratingly tough because of the lack of any overlap, identical health bars for friendly and enemy, lack of hotkeys/hotgroups, stupid/unpredictable AI behavior, and no strategy interface to coordinate your forces or do anything complex. Upgrading apartments manually takes forever and often is counterintuitive because monsters will demand things they don't actually want or need and frequently when you satisfy requirements and make a really nice apartment the monster you just spent a lot of money pleasing will stop paying rent because now he can't afford it. These kinds of unnatural hurdles are everywhere in this game. Unique nouns in the game generally reference internet games and meme culture, as seems to be the popular tactic of late for flash games where the author doesn't want to do any creative work.Overall Unholy Heights is not really worth spending money on unless it is VERY cheap and you've got nothing better to do than explore simple flash games.

At first I was intrigued and was having a small amount of fun but as the game progressed I just lost more and more interest.I felt like you have to maintain the monster's wants to much and they're still never happy no matter how much you spend and how low you make their rent. Not to mention if one dies then you have a room full of stuff that the next monster could not even need or like so you're trying to figure out if you need to sell it or what. What. It was very frustrating, but if you can overlook that unlike me then that should irrelevant. Also it seemed like you had to evict monsters or get them killed so you could start making money and room for the stronger monsters, which I don't like because eviction is a♥♥♥♥♥♥move and killing them is more of a♥♥♥♥♥♥move. That's just my personal opinion though.Oh, and you'll have to grind a bit to get more money from rent but it's not to bad since the game has an increase speed option.

That could work, but it probably wouldn’t be nearly as fun as what Unholy Heights’ developers thought of.""The Devil’s spent his savings on a place in the projects!"" is the line that opens the game. Satan now owns an apartment building, and has to bring monsters in as tenants to not only get some cash, but also to protect the place from foolish adventurers looking to slay him. Priorities, see,afterall those folks are dead, and we’ve some money in the bank, then we’ll talk about that havoc, and about world domination.You have a side view of the building. Whenever you’re attacked, the adventurer party will climb floor by floor, attempting to reach The Devil’s room, and you have to call on his tenants to prevent that from happening. When you're not under attack, you’ll need to recruit more tenants and keep them happy, so they’ll fight better and pay more rent. Of course, you aren’t above evicting them if they fail at either of those things.It’s very engaging, not only because of the gameplay, but the cute cartoon-ish presentation keeps you attached to each monster as they form their families and advance in their careers. It’s hard not to like them, or not feel slightly saddened when they die or leave. But, back to mechanics, the engagement also owes a lot to the surprising amount of depth to the game.Higher tier monsters have to be unlocked, and each has its own demands for that to happen, demands which aren’t always simple to meet. As you unlock those monsters, you’ll also need to mind the room allocation for battle: some monsters can tank more hits while others work better shooting from afar. To say nothing of the stat growth mechanics.Still, you can learn most of it in a few hours, without worry. It is truly a gem of an indie game, bringing together management, tower defense and real-time strategy, and still remaining quite accessible. You will need to read guides if you go for 100% completion, but whether or not you decide to, Unholy Heights still offers incredible value for its low asking price of four dollars."

If you're dying a lot, pay attention to resistences. If the adventuers you're going up against are mostly mages, then make sure that a monster with high magic resist is leading the charge. Make use of pincher manuevers and save empty slots in your apartments for healing items so that you can get your heavy hitters back in the fight quickly.Don't forget to adjust your rent according to how upgraded your apartments are. If your favorite monster is falling behind on his rent, set it to $0 until he manages to catch up again. Don't let him build up a huge debt or he'll just skip town without paying and then you'll lose both the money and the monster.If you have deadbeat monsters who frequently fail to pay their rent but are essential to your defense then just resign yourself to not collecting any income from them. It's not worth the risk in the long run and your other monsters should more than make up the difference as long as you're frequently doing quests."

As others have said, it doesn't have a ton of depth that others in the genre have, but it is still fun.  If anything, it was a game I liked to return to when I wasn't up to playing something very difficult; an easy after work game with cute visuals, music, and game play.You might be able to do about two play throughs of the game, as some monsters don't like each other and it is difficult to have all of the monster types on one play through.  But, once you've beaten it twice, there isn't a lot of incentive to go back.All in all, I would recommend.

Attract monsters to live in your apartment block, keep them happy through apartment upgrades, breed them to be stronger, and defend your (and their) home against the constant stream of hero hopefuls who are after you and your treasure.Lots of lovely detail absolutely makes this - monsters will be away from home at different times depending on their job, different types of monsters do or don't get on with each other, apartment upgrades can increase chances of a monster getting a better job (which means you can charge them more rent) or a partner (with whom they can have kids which grow up to be stronger than their parents and may flee the apartment if their parents 'engage in pillow-talk'), and lots of other little things that give the little folks lots of personality.

It's amazing just how many details you have to keep track of when managing an apartment for the Devil!  And while the idea sounds simple, it's actually quite challenging.  While you may have to employ a bit of strategy in choosing which monsters you're going to take in as renters, there's still a lot of randomness involved.  Many successes or failures may reside on the luck of the draw.  For instance, there have been times when my apartment was attacked while all of my monster tenants were out either shopping or at work.  But it's that sort of randomness that gives the game a lot of replayability.All in all, this is an excellent little game that could very well keep you entertained for hours to come.

It's surprisingly addictive to spend time upgrading your rooms, getting happy tenants, helping them find partners and have kids, then kicking them out so their kids can take over with superior stats.The idler part is that often it's better to let it run on speed 3 a bit and deal with occasional raids whilst people heal, pay you rent, and you upgrade their rooms...and hope that they don't run into financial issues and not have rent money.The monster bit is a bit annoying with regards to variety. There's 6 races and each like different things, but some monsters (any Undead) are just far better than others (Cheepies, who are utter garbage).

,Recommended,249330,8772423,"Posted: 19 January, 2014",all,Ryebread,"Unholy Heights is like a proposal for a game: a combination of scaled-down elements from Dungeon Keeper (RTS) and Sim Tower (Management Sim). The entirety of it is short, combat is simple, and you'll be managing a smaller amount of units (48 at most) and always in the same area, but this game gives the enjoyment of building up an unconquerable core of trusted tenant-minions for a very reasonable price, more so during steam sales.You are the landlord of an apartment of minions, and must manage their happiness to bolster their effectiveness against hordes of incoming adventurers. You start off small with one floor of four apartments. Each can have a single tenant who can eventually become part of a family of three, and as the game progresses, you can have a maximum of four floors with 48 tenants in your care and functioning as your defense. And if you want these tenants to be good at defending you, you have to keep them happy with appropriate furniture and compatible neighbours.The RTS elements come into play when looting adventuring march straight for your landlord's office. To safeguard your money, you can call out your tenants who'll then head straight for the closest enemy and fight until A: he dies; B: it dies; or C: you tell it to retreat. You can apply advanced tactics with positioning (call out tenants at the right time to attack fragile supporting enemies) and attrition tactics (summon and recall tenants to wear down larger enemies). But ultimately, combat boils down to having a meaty tenant as a tank and throwing as many ranged and long-ranged tenants behind him to supply additional damage.However, this feels more like an experiment than a game: to test if the developer could make a game like this, and to test if a game like this can be enjoyed. Parts of the game are ambiguous (how happy will this furniture make this monster? how important is breeding in making stronger tenants?). Also, your tenants' movements (especially when they leave the building for work or play) are uncontrollable beyond calling them out of their apartments during invasions. As such, you may find frustration in unpredictably becoming shorthanded.In the end, I still enjoyed Unholy Heights, though much more as a Sim than a RTS. The appeal in this game is building up your apartment army like a deck of cards, trying to keep your tenants alive and happy so your building becomes more attractive to  stronger kinds of tenants. The payoff comes when you have built up a full army so strong that no invading hero can ever best you, and you watch on in satisfaction when the world cedes control to your unstoppable forces.If you want an affordable low-PC-requirements game to while away a few hours offline or on a long trip, and have a taste for simulation games with a monster-management twist, then I heartily recommend Unholy Heights as a delightful demonic diversion.Addendum: The game boasts a lot of mildly amusing flavor text (sometimes due to the random generation) as well: Big hairy yeti dominatrixes, werewolf chefs becoming culinary geniuses, and of course, many behind-closed-doors instances of your tenants ""making"" more tenants."

It's not addicting, but it is a pretty good game to waste some time on, or just to try something new. It has its troll moments, and I was grinning at some of the dialogue the monsters made. You're the devil in this game. You don't take over the world or be evil, you simply give monsters a place to live, make sure they're satisfied to become stronger, watch them live their lives, and fight guilds off.Butttt, getting into the deep side of this game.. You have to choose your tennants wisely. Depending on their job, they'll be able to pay the rent, more or less. If they're for example a window washer, obviously they'll be very poor and probably won't even be able to pay off 14g's worth of rent. You get rent every day, which lasts for about 30 seconds if you have x3 speed.What's cute about it is that not only the artstyle is cute and cuddly but the literal whole story. I mean, the game has unholy in it, and you're playing as the devil. But it's really not that at all, it's just like a hotel tycoon game with monster characters. Not to mention you get to see your tennants running back home in the rain scared, poor tennants that aren't able to pay rent will usually have a nervous or timid status (but is still able to fight), and little baby skeletons and chicklings. <:It's a bit strategic as well. Waiting to get a good monster that has a good job and has high damage in health is kind of the learning part to the game. You get to learn which jobs pay more unless of course you're an actual person and actually know how much an amateur boxer and/or an unpopular comic creator gets paid.  Different monsters have different pleasures too, some guys like the room hot, some like it cold. Some don't care if it's clean, some really mind. Cheap furniture will suffice for beginning monsters but as you progress they're going to request for more expensive items - especially the demons. But the demons are pretty damn helpful in battle.Speaking of battle, you do have to wait a while to start new quests, just so your monsters can regen health get a +1 on their attack, but I enjoy this kind of stuff.Excuse my sleep deprived mind as I am only using %8 of my brain at the moment, but seriously, it's a dollar, or at least it is in the holiday sale, I wouldn't recommend buying it for the full $4. It should be worth $2 max."

Well, it's got some bits of micromanagement and a tad bit of combat mechanics. I'll go into much better detail below.TLDR here and at the bottom for convience \/TLDR; Overall, Unholy Heights is a fun micromanagement game with moderately deep but easy to understand combat mechanics (RTS), quirky (and sometimes adult) humor, and cute simplistic graphics. Despite a small language barrier, with a small amount of time the game is easily understood. Later parts of the game can get a bit grindy, so it's better suited for small bouts of play for some casual fun.-----------------------------------------------------Just as a forewarning, the original developers' first language is not English. While the game is understandable and funny at times, this will be prevelant throughout the game. Some descriptions for items won't make sense. Explanations for important parts of the game are sometimes vague. I had to figure out a LOT by myself, and you will too since the Wiki (the only one I could find) is unfinished and doesn't shed much more light than the game. Luckily, it's not too hard but you will be scratching your head at first.-----------------------------------------------------In Unholy Heights, you are . . . well, Satan himself. And you run apartments. Ironically, you hardly ever see yourself in this game apart from the beginning and a picture when you hover over your manager room. Immediately, you get monsters that want to move in. Just move in all the cute little monsters and you'll be fine, right?Well, sorta. Other than taking care of these monsters, you have to fight off pesky humans that wander into your land. While the combat is a HUGE part of the game, it's fairly simple. Cilck on a door to bring out the monster you want to fight. If they're there, they'll come out. Of course, each monster has their own attributes to contribute to the fight (Range, attack type, and physical and magical defense).Some monsters have 'perks' with different positives, the most common with ""Stronger at -insert day/night/weather"". While this sounds like it makes battles more interesting, you can't predict the weather or when the humans arrive so relying on this will screw you over. Improving your 'strategy' (when and where you release your monsters when you have attackers) is what you'll be doing most of the time in concerns to combat. Once you have a solid one down, it's just boosting up your monsters to match the enemies and hoping the ones you need are there when you need them.This is where the apartment bits come into play. To get stronger monsters, you have to improve their apartments and make them happy. The happier they are, the stronger they get. Other than the obviously stronger higher tier monsters (unlocked through raising your interest/respect/like for the Devil and through completing 'Quests'), you can get stronger monsters through a couple having a baby. Randomly, one of your monsters will get a lover, and after a random number of 'Pillowtalks' they'll have a baby. When the baby grows up, they'll have significantly stonger stats then their parents.""Reputation"" with certain monster factions/races will play a part in what monsters you can use, house, and unlock. Some can't stand each other. Others worry about how well your treating your residents, while others focus on how often your resident die/how long they live. This means you may have to sacrifice one for the other, since their requirements will be the opposite of another. Once one faction hates you, don't expect to see them again unless you do something huge to get them to like you again. Once a faction likes you and you complete the quest, you unlock new and stronger tiers that have a new set of attributes and likes and dislikes on their apartment. It's very satisfying to unlock these new creatures able to use them and just brings new life to the game after you've played for a long while.However, getting the stronger monsters to match the quests you have available can take some time. The difficulty increase is moderately steep, so even if you have a solid strategy you'll be grinding small random encouters to make money, waiting for rent to be paid, satisfy your monsters, and hopefully have them have babies. It's all random, so you'll be sitting there with the highest speed on waiting for things to happen. Hopefully you have a second monitor to watch things on; the game 'pauses' when you alt tab in both Fullscreen and Windowed mode. Luckily, watching your residents as they go about their life can be pretty entertaining, but even then you should probably take a break from this game every once and awhile to not get burned out on it.-----------------------------------------------------TLDR; Overall, Unholy Heights is a fun micromanagement game with moderately deep but easy to understand combat mechanics (RTS), quirky (and sometimes adult) humor, and cute simplistic graphics. Despite a small language barrier, with a small amount of time the game is easily understood.

Basically, the devil decided to run his own apartment complex, and in order to protect himself he persuades the residents to fight for him. Each resident has varying stats, along with different fighting styles (melee, ranged, & magic), so having a variety of monsters is ideal. Simply knock on the door of the resident that you want to fight, and they'll go kill as many adventurers as they can handle without a second thought. The apartment management might be a little difficult in the beginning, due to the lack of rooms you start out with - just 4. If you want another level, you'll have to save up enough money to begin construction, and it can get pretty expensive. This is where planning what monsters you have is important because you'll need them to defend until you can afford to build another floor and housemoremonsters. Oh, and always remember to keep your residents happy :)The ResidentsAs I mentioned above, it's important to ensure the happiness of your residents. Happy monsters = increased popularity for the devil, and they won't run off because they hate you. Keeping your residents happy is simple, mainly because they'll tell you what they want and you just satisfy their request. Most of the time, they'll ask for better furniture, etc., but it might get a little tricky if you have two monster types that hate each other and they want you to give the other the boot. Definitely check out the beastiary if you're unsure of any monsters that might clash. Rent is also an important thing to consider; always give them a price that they're happy with. If, for whatever reason, they can't afford to pay rent, lower it a bit until they pay off their debt. An unhappy resident will leave if they are unsatisfied or in debt for too long.Daily LifeAside from fighting and asking you for everything under the sun, they're just regular monsters trying to live their lives. They have jobs, go to school, find love, and make babies. Oh, and of course you'll know every single thing they do throughout their day, ranging from things like 'engaging in pillowtalk' or 'reading erotic fanfiction' to normal chores. They're a lot like us ♡Things to LoveThe graphics are simply adorable and really suit the game.

,Recommended,249330,7612425,"Posted: 9 November, 2013",all,Muir,"Brief synopsis:Extremely cute game. You're the Devil. The Devil is a landlord of an apartment complex. Monsters and Demons are your tenants. Fight off the guilds and the heroes  and build your complex to the skies!Proper review:Story:The story in this game can't really be called a story. Instead, I'd call it a ""plot"".You've got the devil who has decided to open an apartment complex in ""The projects"". You start off with a delapidated, one story building with 4 apartments. Monsters and demons of various types and abilities move in.Soon, local adventurers hear about this and decide they need to rid the world of the evil there. Defeating these adventurers gives you money to improve your apartments as well as unlocking different and stronger monsters.Graphics:The graphics are simple, yet charming. The game itself only has one setting - The Devil's apartment building. One would think that this would get boring after awhile, but it oddly doesn't. I think that's because things are constantly changing. Sometimes it's nice and sunny, other times it's raining. There's also a day and night cycle. These changes happen quickly enough so that you don't get bored, but not too quickly. Also, there are speed up time buttons which also help.Music/Sounds: The music is fairly decent and upbeat. The best song, in my opinion, is the one which plays during the end ""credits"" (which are well worth watching). The sound effects do get tiresome and annoying after awhile, but it's easily overlooked.Length:It took me about 24 hours to complete the game, though I tend to play games slowly as a personal preference. Others have finished the game in around 7-8 hours. Even if you only get 6 hours out of the game, it's still worth the asking price.Replayability: After beating the game, a ""Free Battle Mode"" is unlocked in the options menu which makes the game somewhat replayable. There are also achievements which you probably won't be able to get during your first playthrough which helps add to the replayability of the game (assuming you like achievements).Overall, if you like more ""casual"" games or are looking for a game which you can play in short increments and come back to later, this is definitely a game which you might like.My advice: Try the demo and if you like it, buy it! :)"

A fusion of monster-breeding / tower defence, the cutesy graphics and quirky soundtrack add a touch of whimsy to the game. You basically spend your time managing your growing apartment, earning income to see to the needs of your population of tenants. Each race of tenants has their own demands and even ongoing racial rivalries that will require you to pick and choose who or what you want to stay and adds a touch of replayability.As much as I enjoy the game though, it plays very much like a semi-idle game as some events like breeding, getting a house-mate and even a tenant you want are so random that you sometimes find yourself leaving the game running for hours. This would be okay if the game could run in the background while you do other things like surf or do your homework, but it does not. The feature of the game auto-pausing when the window is not active might ordinarily be a good thing, but in this case it only makes gameplay a little tedious since you become a prisoner of the window.All in all, it makes for an interesting way to burn a few hours, but not if you like multitasking on your computer."

It's well worth the price and has plenty of (admittedly grind-y) content.You start off with a little run down apartment building which can house five tenants and their potential families. You are landlord Satan (can you blame me for the pun), and it's your goal to upgrade the building, bleed your tenants as dry as you can, and eventually conquer the world. But that takes both money AND reliable tenants. By reliable, I mean they must not only pay rent on time, but also be capable of defending the complex from human would-be-heroes.Combat is very much tower-defense if instead of ""towers vs. advancing units"" it was just ""units vs. units."" Each potential tenant has different abilities: the centaur is an archer, the skeleton is a melee, there's a snail with a house for a shell that launches rockets (don't ask)... What's more, to unlock more units you have to please the various factions each unit belongs to. The undead like repeated victories in combat, demons like it when you send people to their pointless, cannon-fodder deaths, chimera appreciate it when you make sure everyone's happy... Some of these factions conflict in what they like, too, meaning you're going to have to pick which faction to hedge your bets on.Though the name pool for your tenants is surprisingly limited (I saw a lot of repeats), you'll find yourself getting pretty attached to some of the families in your apartments. Couples can have children, and children can grow up to be adult monsters as well. Your single tenant can potentially grow into a family of three of the same unit. As a plus, the more working adults are within the family, the higher rent they can pay, plus the easier it is for them to work their way out of debt, meaning you usually won't have to evict them.The only cons of this game from what I've played of it are the grinding (can take a long time to grind up needed gold so you can invest in good apartments/expand them) and how easily it is early on to be susceptible to full wipes. If you've just started the game and are getting frustrated, my advice is 1) do the water witch quest after upgrading the apartment for the first time, 2) make sure to net a couple demihumans, they pay higher rents, and 3) don't feel pressured to take quests you're not ready for. This game is a slow burner, and if you try to rush through it it burns you in return.In the end, this game is simple enough for a time waster yet complex enough to be enjoyable. It's well worth full price, and if it ever goes on sale for less, that's a steal. I definitely recommend it to anyone, unless you're just really, really impatient, in which case this game might not be for you."

You can also breed them for offspring with higher stats. Some monsters don't get along with each other so you will probably find yourself playing through the first time without even seeing them all.

76561198010970250,Recommended,249330,18457550,"Posted: 13 October, 2015",all,blackwall,"A fun casual sort of tower defense game but with a unique premise. You play as the Devil who decides to become a landlord one day, when in truth, you're planning to conquer the world. How? By tricking monsters as your tenants annd turning them into your personal army of soldiers of course. It's pretty silly. And that's as far as the story goes.There are various monster types and tiers, each with different tastes, wants and needs. Fulfill what they want and their satisfaction goes up and their stats are boosted too. Eventually your monsters grow more powerful and fight more powerful enemies. Typical game structure you'd expect.But this isnt just a tower defense game. What makes the game special really, is the ""Sims"" aspect of it. After all, the monsters arent staying to fight, they need to make a living too. You can keep informed on a plethora of small things like what each monster is doing, see how they're doing, where are they, their jobs, occupation and their activities.Monsters can also sleep, eat, play, even find partners, make love and bear babies. Don't bother thinking on how monsters like skeletons are even capable of reproducing, they just do.On the more important aspect of gameplay, Unholy Heights does disappoint me slightly with how the game turned out. Controls are a little frustrating to deal with, such as when trying to select a specific monster. Combat isn't so refined and in fact, feels unfair given how the only control you have over the monsters is to retreat or attack.  The 2D platform also gives rise to limitations and cheap exploits, like cornering an enemy and glitching the AI to be indecisive on which direction to attack.Many things are also based on luck and coincidence and this is where things can sometimes get a little frustrating. You could wait for countless hours and still not have some of your monsters refusing to give birth. The monsters freely entering and exiting the house whenever they like is another thing that sucks. Get into a battle but your useful monsters just happen to be away? You're deadmeat. About to get into battle but your useful monsters decide to leave the house half-way in? You're deadmeat.Or what annoys me the mos: when some of your weaker monsters suddenly return back home during a battle. Sometimes they're stacked in a row stretching so far away, you cant even see them on the screen. If they meet a more powerful enemy head-on, you're helplessly screwed.In Unholy Heights. everything runs down to what matters most: Money. Money is generated primarily from rent income, but this makes for easy exploiting. Get a stable income and just wait in-game without doing anything for hours and you'll find yourself rich automatically, although this will put you at odds with a few monster types.All in all, regardless of a few problems... most of which I'm probably just nitpicking at, this game is actually pretty darn great. It doesn't exactly feel fun but like any decent casual game, it can definitely be addicting to play. Almost too addicting for me.Perhaps it's the simplicity of the game, or how you can just lay back and do nothing while watching your monsters live their lifes, have sex everyday and make babies."

I understand the tennants have to go out to do jobs, but lets be honest shall we?  This is essentially a tower defense game where sometimes your towers just aren't there."

WRONG! spending that dollar on a McChiken sandwich and then enduring the diarrhea that followed would be better time management. i spent a dollar on this game.. and i feel absolutely robbed.. i made sure to add these devs and all their games past and future to my ""never buy or support"" list. well.. back to the forest.. you know.. a game that works.. and is good."

It's really fun and now that I've beaten the game, I can idle it if I need to go and do something for a minute or two. Although free battle mode sends monsters back home a bit quicker than I'd like it to.I really enjoy playing it, thugh. And it can be difficult in places, but not stupendously difficult, which is good when you like a challenge but you also suck at challenges. Like me."

Count between 10 to 16 hours for one playthrough, and from 20 to 30 if you are doing it twice in order to max your reputation with all monster species.Be ready for weird stuff though, like two vampires having sex while their child cowers in a corner, a widow zombie who still manages to survive until the last boss while having lost five boyfriends and her own daughter, ...Sad stuff can also happen: I've had this little succubus who lost her parents twice and then her boyfriend to die in front of the legendary hero... Anse, I'm sorry you didn't get to rule the world with us!"
,Recommended,249330,34092069,Posted: 7 August,all,Jaena,"I've only played this game for two hours and, although it's pretty simple, it's challenging for me. Granted I might suck at these kind of games, I'm enjoying the experience nonetheless. In the game, you manage where everyone lives and what tenants you have (as well as what upgrades their room has). Your choices are informed by the quest you've chosen for the tower defense portion of the game. It's a really interesting integration of the two types of games and I'm still trying to figure out how best to play.Recommend: 5/5"
