76561198024543572,Not Recommended,249550,13618900,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,Sauce,"First: Look at these positive reviews. It's either people with around 1k hrs (more or less) or people under 50hrs. My friends and I purchased this game during last years steam sale (after the big content patch).- Playerbase: 30 people worldwide (official and unofficial servers)- Content: You'll hit max level in a week then hit a brick wall in content. Your choices will be to grind badges, grind trash mobs in a dungeon or ""grind new characters so you can grind"" all of the above(Admind told me that). Oh there's a colusseum for pvp/items but the devs have not hosted events in years (see below). Also don't expect new content anytime soon, years maybe. Devs are pre-occupied raising children and that's fine.If you started this game when it first opened, the content was way easier up until they patched(Youtube videos of boss battles are dated by years). Content now does not scale with their content patches.- Classes: Some are useful some are to be carried. Ex: Soldier was a beast 2-3 years ago, after last years patch he gets ko'd in a pillow fight.- Game UI: Simple and easy, they did fine here.They recently merged an official 4 year old pvp server with another official PVP server that started last year when NEStalgia was on sale. The 4 year old server was previously locked as well, so a handful of people had a private server all to themselves. Remember that colusseum pvp/items I was talking about(the devs do not host anymore)? Players from the 4 year old server are decked out in end game pvp gear. YOU can not get this gear.When I asked a MOD about this I was told that I ""should have started 4 years ago"". Their condescension and belittling was a nice touch. Also, the admins and moderators aren't just there to ""help"", they can take part in open world pvp as well. Good to know!If you are new, I do not recommend this game."
,Recommended,249550,9827593,"Posted: 15 April, 2014",all,Marona,"I have played this game once it got on Greenlight, and I have to say I fell in love with it. For once, an MMORPG that plays like an old school RPG with simple and nostalgic graphics.There are many servers, but all of them have a low population to have a close knit community, like a family. You're gonna know everyone you see. So you won't be drowned in the crowds. Instead, someone will notice you and you will notice them. If you're interested in what server I started and now playing on, it is Greenlight (Password: Slime).The gameplay introduces you to an opening, just like any other RPG, and slowly introduces you to the battle and the pet system. There are also other quests you can do. It's like World of Warcraft meets Old School RPGs (Don't worry...not the same amount of quests like WoW so stop breathing heavily lol.)The storyline is unique and follows the same feel of classic SNES and NES games. Saving the world, seeing the future, stop corrupting government, etc.The battle is what made me fell in love with this: a balanced turn-based like the Final Fantasy games and Dragon Quest games. It even gives a timer for existing party members to make their move, and to keep the flow going.There are a variety of classes out there. I can't really review on the class balance since I only played one, so I'll review what I learned as a Conjurer. The Conjurer class is a balance between heal overtime and magical damage overtime. Sorta half the effect of a Cleric and a Mage, but hey, you got two powers...gotta find balance there. As a Conjurer, you're gonna need help between your peers and pets combined.Overall, this game is a dream come true for old school rpg lovers who want an mmorpg experience like it. This game is a must have if you like:Old RPG games back in the old daysTurn based battle systemA developing, intriguing story.Simple graphics.Even if it's just one of those reasons, get it."
,Not Recommended,249550,9834640,"Posted: 16 April, 2014",all,[NE]Widget,"So, major issues preventing reviewing actual game were resolved.  Mostly just by time and persistently launching the game to check and see if things were fixed.  Go stubborness!So, there's quite a number of endearing things about NEStalgia.  It's a love letter to NES style RPGs and it pulls off a lot of the tropes quite well.  However, some of those very things are things that might mean the game isn't for you unless you *like* those things.  The game world won't take pity on you and neither will many of the players.  They will help and give instruction when it's asked for appropriately but they're fiercely defensive and loyal to the game.  This is both good and bad.  The music is charming and the bits I explored were well done.  There's one early quest if you take the time to make sure you're getting all the quests that I found pretty neat.  If you don't do that and persue just the storyline, you're going to have a bad time.  The skill trees open up at Level 5 and they add a level of depth to the game that makes it worth playing through several times just to play with the different character classes.   I played a bit with both a cleric and a soldier.  They felt sufficiently different from eachother to be enjoyable.  There's 8 different classes to play with and when creating a character you're given several color choices and I believe 3 options for both head and body of the character as well as choices between male and female characters.  I believe there's a lot of depth in the game based just on the character classes alone.  The gameplay is pretty typical of old JRPGs.  Move around, random battles.  One of the larger differences is the ability to recruit monsters you defeat.  It's a pretty neat thing and there's a huge amount of depth here that I've only scratched the surface of.  Something that is probably a plus, but, I didn't quite enjoy is the amount of 'secret passages'.  Occasionally there's a tile that looks off that you can walk right through, and frequently the way to get to a chest you can see is just to walk over background that's normally impassable.   There seems to be a lot of concern about developer censorship and bad moderating behavior, I personally have NOT experienced this, from what I've read in the forum, the dev seems to want to address issues like the ones I experienced; this is a good thing.Then there's the bad.  I brought these up as points of frustration in game and they were defended against solidly by many of the players in game.  It made me leery of voicing further dissent inside the game as it felt like every point I made had to be met with solid defense instead of an 'I understand your frustration, why don't you try X or Y?' which is what's lead to my comments above about people being fiercely loyal to the game.   It creates a slightly inhospitable atmosphere.  So, first there were the account creation issues, the fact that it errored when trying to originally link my steam account was one of the things that initially lead me to be leery of further things in the game.  This was eventually resolved, but, it's something to keep in mind that you may have issues getting the game going.  Actual in game issues.  The movement lag mentioned by others is there, I was able to cope, but, it was noticeable.  Entering the starter town from the east would often spit you right back out of town, not game breaking, but, frustrating on top of some of the other issues as well.  In fights, the fights are slow paced, so I often had the habit of just tapping '1' to attack, attack first monster, repeat.  After a while however, the game started warning me about spamming.  I was eventually booted by the 'bot detection'.  It's sort of understandable, but, I'd rather have an 'auto-fight' option if I can't just tap the key, if this option does exist, it wasn't immediately obvious to me.  The pacing of the game felt off to me, and as I said above, if you just try to head for the story, you'll have a bad time as the monsters exceed your power quickly and some NES era difficulty raises it's head.  There is not much context if any that this kind of thing will happen, and when it does it didn't feel very fair to me.  That being said, death has little to no consequences that I noticed, and you're simply revived at the last town.  The game is a BYOND game that does not mention it's a BYOND game.  This is a negative that actually goes both ways though.  Even though I view it as negative, the fact that the game has production values good enough that it doesn't seem obviously like one, is a huge credit to the staff.  However, if it had been marketed as a BYOND game and clearly mentioned it, I would never have purchased the 3 pack of it.  The marketing and style of the game had me sold, but, I ended up feeling deceived.So, what's all this huge wall of text mean?  Honestly, if I could walk away from this with a 'Neutral' vote instead of a thumbs up or thumbs down I would.  However, it does directly ask a question, Do you recommend this game?  No, I do not.  I think the overall gaming experience for the majority of people in my social circle would be negative.  There are those that love this style of thing and would love the quirks as much as anything else, but, that's not me.   I tried to list good and bad things about the game and everyone else can use their best judgement to decide if the game is for them or not."

I was emulating dragon warrior nes and snes games when i came accross this on steam.  This is Dragon Warrior meets steroids.  The community is awesome, always helpful and kind.  1893 hours of play time @ review and i still have lots of classes to build differently and complete.  Just pay Silk his money, cya on midgard server."
76561197984657372,Recommended,249550,9901104,"Posted: 22 April, 2014",all,Antpile,"I had never heard of this game before the Steam release. I picked up the 3 pack early just to give it a whirl and gave 2 copies to some friends of mine. For those of you that don't want to read the whole review, I'll just come out and say that I absolutely love the game. One of the better games I've played so far in 2014. My friends and I have had a blast playing it, and if that isn't the bar for what constitutes a good game, it should be. That being said, not everyone will love it. Read on to see if this isn't your bag.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is highly reminiscent of the Dragon Warrior games or the early Final Fantasy games on the NES. If that last sentence instantly sets off bells of nostalgia for you, then you will probably like this game. Don't run out and buy it yet though! The game is deliberately 8 bit and old school, where you walk around a 2d world getting into random encounters that pop up out of nowhere. The point is to level, hope for rare drop loot, and beat bosses at the bottoms of dungeons to complete quests.The battle is where this game shines especially if you have two friends. And that is also this games biggest weakness. The game is still fun solo, but the companion monsters from your ranch (think having a stable of pokemon), are usually sufficient enough but stupid. This not only lowers the fun of enacting well crafted plans with your friends so that all of your moves play out in perfect turn order like a well choerographed bank heist, but also makes certain battles very difficult. The point is, if you go this solo, there may still be points where you'll want to group up with someone else in the world.Beyond that, battles often get tough and intense where your life might hang in the balance of which member of your party a monster attacks or if your healer has enough agility to get his heal in before the monster gets his bite in. The battles are pretty fast paced and can swing from good to bad quickly. The battles also reward strategic thinking, but it is possible to brute force your way through much of it just by grinding out another level or two if things get tough. The combat is definitely where this game shines.CLASSES:There are 8 classes that all play differently from eachother. Some of the classes are similar in style and role but still manage to maintain their identity. I have personal experience with the Warlock, Conjurer, Wizard, and a ranger that I specced to play like an offensive lightning slinging druid. All 4 were casters, yet no two were alike. The conjurer is all about damage over time and can heal almost as well as he can kill while the Wizard takes more of a straightforward approach and just hits stuff upside the head for huge single hit numbers with fireballs and the like. The warlock life drains constantly and uses his own HP to cast instead of mana while the Ranger almost always goes first in combat due to high agility, can hit things upside the head with his staff for a respectable amount of damage to save mana on trash, and could still chuck around heals and spells with fairly strong results.THE STORY:Something about time travel. Who cares? I wouldn't call story this game's strong point. It's there, but it hasn't exactly left me pining for a tie in novel.FINAL RESULTS:The good:+ Fun MMO-like game set in a old school NES RPG setting.+ Great fun with 2 friends+ Can still be fun solo, but may require grouping at points.+ Combat is excellent and nail biting+ Classes are well designed and play differently from eachother+ Terrible graphics that pleasantly remind us of a bygone era.The Bad:- Some battles are nigh-unsoloable. (lookin at you Guardian)- Can get a bit grindy at times.- Terrible graphics that remind you of nothing because you weren't gaming in the 80s.- The boat ride between Balzackia and Piatta can't be skipped after the first time :(- Story is nothing to write home about."

I assumed it might be hard to solo, but I like a challenge so I figured bring it on.  Long story short, there's just nothing here for me.  2 hours in and I am bored to tears with the slow, painfully simple combat and cliche questing.  I played Dragon Warrior back in the day, and even revisited it recently, but even that game didn't feel as slow or grindy.It's obvious all the effort went into the multiplayer aspect, and really I shouldn't be surprised since that's the whole focus of this title, but I just wish there was the single player was a bit better.  The nail in the coffin for me was the fact that the chat window (which you can't remove even when offline as far as I know) booted me out of my own game 4 times in a row for ""spamming"" in my own offline game.  I'm sorry but that really chapped my♥♥♥♥♥FYI, the stuttering other reviews mentioned is gone in the latest version, so for those interested in the multiplayer I'd say go for it.  The multiplayer people are probably having a blast.  If you just happen to interested in this for the single player like I was though, just keep moving."

Each time I've been dissapointed.-The player-base is small, with at most 10 people online at any given time. This means that many things you need for progression are simply impossible to get without devoting your own time and energy into crafting (in a poor crafting system) for hundreds of hours. The in-game economy is completely crippled because of this.-The few players that do still play are either Admins or long-time players, none of which are friendly or willing to spend time playing with you.-The admins can be outright abusive. Name-calling is common, as well as being banned for setting a server (hosted on your own computer) to private after banning individuals from joining. You need to hope that the person banned wasn't an alt account of an Admin, because you WILL become permabanned from all public servers, as well as having your account banned from logging in (and stopping your ability from hosting your own server.-The last update was over nine months ago. What did it add? Alleged FPS improvements, which are not noticeable considering the immense lag (mentioned numerous times in other reviews) and DLC in the form of a soundtrack. Silk Games essentially only updated the game to milk a few bucks from their player-base, versus actually doing anything substantial to their MMO.-The game lags heavily, regardless of your PC's specs or connection. It's an engine problem, and it hasn't been fixed in years. Even with 10 people on a server, or by yourself on a private server, you will suffer immense lag spikes and random freezes during encounters, rending it unplayable.-The developer picks apart negative reviews without fixing the issues posted, many of which have been problems since release. I wouldn't be surprised if the same happens to my review.-The game has effectively been abandoned. The last posted update was in September of 2016, and that was only to push a soundtrack DLC. The developer's Reddit account, Steam account, Facebook page, Twitter, BYOND account, blog and even website have all been abandoned since last year, with no updates posted or even responses sent to messages from customers.It may be tempting to buy this on sale, but please don't. Your time is worth far more than that.And let me respond to the developer, who elected to pretend problems don't exist instead of actually addressing issues:""-""Crafting"" is currently limited to creating simple weapon damage enchants, and isn't required for progression at all.""It's still an inaccessible part of the game, which means anyone who wants to min-max simply can't.""-The Admins are not abusive, and are rarely even present on the official server. No one has been banned from the official servers since well before the game was released on Steam. Also, we don't care and don't pay attention to what happens on other public/private servers.""This is simply not true. Going through Steam reviews, BYOND forums and even the official forums confirms this.""-Any online game will occasionally experience lag, but what you're describing here is a complete fabrication. The game is usually lag free and runs at 40 fps with no problems.""It is a legitimate issue that does happen. It's confirmed not just by me, but by other reviewers and people seeking technical support in the official forums.""-The only time we've had players unable to login is when they've forgotten their account name or password, both problems that we're happy to help with.""Again, this is untrue, and again has been brought up in other reviews and the official forums.""I'm not sure why you've taken the time to make this stuff up, but I've long given up trying to unpack the motives and actions of angry people and trolls on the internet.""The developer has been inactive on Steam and social media since the soundtrack update over nine months ago, and only came back to respond to my review. No word on updates, and no contact asking if these issues could be resolved. This game had the capacity to be great, and at one point was. Instead, legitimate issues with the game remain unfixed. The response by the developer wasn't, ""here's a problem, how do I fix it."" The response was, ""I'm infallible so anyone who critiques my game is a troll."" The very nature of an online game requires that it has an active developer, but the only action this game has seen in the past nine months is a developer calling their customers trolls.I'm not sure why the developer continues to attack users with legitimate issues, especially considering that these problems have been happening for years. The developer can claim that there are regular updates and no server issues, but their own community as well as unofficial Discord, both of which have players who have struggled through the bulk of the game's lifespan, have complaints about the game's instability and the developer's dishonesty. Seehttp://imgur.com/a/6L6Sqfor a few examples of the people he refers to as, ""angry people and trolls on the internet"" trying in vain to have their issues addressed."

In a time where games provide many tools as standard, this one lacks those in such a way where it feels like a mistake/grievance as opposed to intentional difficulty.- The game forces you to grind. Sometimes, you can walk a mere 5 steps before being aggro'd again.- Steep EXP incline. I noticed that the first 10 levels were fairly simple, but as I rose beyond that, it took increasingly long to level up. What made this harder was...- Monster EXP doesn't scale. Travelled to a new area with significantly harder monsters, and gained the same EXP.- Irregular monster difficulty. No joke- in one area, you can be hit for 6 damage by one enemy, or your whole party can be burned for 12-16 damage each by another.- Tiny community. Everyone talks and tries to help when possible, but there are usually 10-15 people online. Don't expect to find people to actually play with unless you bring a friend.- Terrible UI / chat boxes. Not fluid in the slightest, which only seemed to drag out fights and conversations even longer.Many small things like this summed up to make this entire game less of a wonderful way to reminisce and more of an incitement of frustration.Save yourself the $15 and plug in your old console the next time you need some nostalgia."

How many retro turn based games can boast have this? Grab two friends and get gaming.Two skill trees for each of the many classes creating custom play style. Join the debate on which build you think is best.Pets you can capture and level up; so many even Ash would feel at home.Refined play style is not realized until you match gear, skills, ability seeds, and pets for a unique experience.Many hidden secrets/paths!!! This game rewards exploration!Great community - Amazing and friendly community. I have never had a hard time finding at least one person with a char my level and looking for fun. This community is committed and strong.PvP for the competitive players.Still actively, albeit slowly, being worked on by the devs. This game is far from being cast aside. Thank you devs for loving this game as much as I do!Cons: The Full Disclosure -Very repetitive game play in early game. I promise you it gets better. If you like old turn based games, it is worth sticking it out.Farming is a must. For some, this alone is a deal breaker. However I find that this mechanic keeps the game true to the RPG genre and enjoy.Solo play on this game can be rough going as built-in game features give noticeable bonuses encouraging grouping.Limited combat animation. Lack of animation attacks can at times leave combat feeling bland. Again, this is meant to mirror older games and can easily be overlooked. This is especially true when you come across a never before seen monster whose sole attack is to slowly tic down for some unknown attack. (Play to find out what it does)Server size - This truth hurts. Servers hold about 30 people and usually only one of the two servers is actively used. With that said, I want to point out that it is exceedingly rare for that sever to be filled with less than 18 people."

Which pretty much makes it very much like the offline. Except with that little extra of having someone around to ask for help if needed.The classes are very well done. I have only experienced merchant. From what I have seen some things are locked until you reach a certain level. The skill tree isn't accesible untillevel five. I wasn't even for sure it existed. Even if there was a picture of it on the store page.The skills were all merchant themed. The all had merchant style names and matching abilities. I spent probably ten minutes just looking through the skill trees.I have seen many attempts at a 8-bit style massive multiplayer game. I even played a few of them. This is the first one I have come across that looks to have done it right. It doesn't do fancy. It doesn't do complicated. It just does 8-bit level MMO.Very much worth the purchase.

And even if you do squeak past this? And even if you are so strong you can one shot the previous area's monsters- Now the next area's enemies are mini boss tough by comparison right out of the gate and you will absolutely require a perfect monster companion makeup or party with healing and endurance to make any progress further.A few people or die hard fans might tell me. ""Just get good!"" I am, I did. Just the game itself got worse instead of better. I don't mind a challenge, I do mind when a game is holding me back at every turn for a lack of being able to make a proper challenge or difficulty curve.Or when it's making me waste time because it's afraid of me getting anywhere or finding out there's nothing more to it than a tiny handful of areas disguised and gated by massive grind."

It never even attempts to act as if it was a particularly involving game and this becomes especially apparant when playing with multiple friends, sharing a party together. Perhaps we've all become too impatient with our games, expecting more active battle systems and a gripping story to follow along, but as a review from someone who's put in almost 100 hours into the game, I can, with some authority, say that the game is very, very dull.Perhaps 20% of the fun of the game came from decisions being made in combat. Another 10% came from the very few decisions you get to make when progressing your character. 0% for story and exploration, and the rest 70% of enjoyment comes from just hanging out for hours with your friends. If you had decided to just talk about random things with 2 of your buddies in a chat room someplace, you'd be having 70% of the enjoyment of this game.The long hours you spend exploring with friends (no matter how hard you try to keep progressing, it will take very long) are exasperated by slow movement, slow exploration, dull monsters and queststasks; and it quickly becomes a chore to even take your turn in combat. You quickly find that you play this game with a more interesting game in another window playing simultaneously and only return to take your turn because you would feel bad about making your friends wait. That's the sort of chore this game becomes.As much as I'd have loved to love this game and would have even more liked to say I completed it, I realize that even if I did, I wouldn't be able to say it was worth it at the end. The finale was as boring as the 90-hour road leading up to it. And those were 90 hours each from myself and another 2 of my friends playing together, their experiences so poor that they didn't even feel like finishing it.I would never wish this experience upon anyone and thus cannot, in good faith, recommend this game to anyone, no matter how patient or enduring they might be. Just because they might be able to play it, doesn't mean they could drag their friends kicking and screaming through such a slog."

If you have senstivity to flashing lights or get headaches to flashing, or are just generally annoyed at everything flashing on a frequent basis then avoid this game.The game currently has a bug which has been stated on the offical forms more than once with the V1.7.0 update and (at writing of this review) hasn't been acknowledged by the dev. The bug is that if you disable either battle or overword flashes  the game corrups and freezes.Now on to the actuall review:Summarry incase you didn't want to read the whole thing:All in all the game is meh. I woudn't say bad but I wouldn't say it is good.To me it takes nestagia and milks it without regard for advancing anything in a meaningful way.Pass for now but don't forget it exsits.Full Review:Mechanics: The mechanics of this game are simple and slightly refined, I would say that simplicity to this game as a throwback to when games didn't need 30 different commads or button presses to do 1 move in battle is what is aluring in this game but the added functions of the skill trees and the companions feel thrown in and unrefined, there is much more potential in thoes systems expecally the companion system. One thing I would change is the ability of actually using the companions in combat instead of setting them on an auto play based on a behavor. Not much else to say here other than the crafting is semi cool but the restriction of dmg based of a particular elemental stat is not needed.Graphics: Well not much to say here, pixle graphics... if you like that sort of thing.Game Pace: Here is a rough one. The pace of the game is really really really slow and is horribly dependent on which class you choose which speed you go. I found the game way to grindy for my pace and I was playing with a friend which made it better, but due to the bug mentions before this review he got sick from the flashing and had to quit.All in all I would say if your looking for some nestagia for the old school games you might be better off waiting on this or playing some of the other old school like games. The creator has an expansion on the horrizon so maybe the game will get better overtime but I would avoid for now but keep on the radar."

It actually covers quite a bit I've been wanting to see in a video-game since I was very young. Multiplayer Turn-based games are few and far between, and even rarer are ones that will allow you to play the storyline together. The best way I can sum up this game is Dragon Warrior Monsters with drop-in/drop-out multiplayer over the internet.Now, this game is far from perfect... They could still use a lot of polish on the questing (it really feels rushed and limited in the early levels), and the grind is kind of lopsided when the monsters are almost 5-10 levels apart in challenge by area, but overall it's really good. The inclusion of a marketplace is great, but unless you're playing on a populated server (and the server I'm playing on isn't populated) then it's all but dead.So, do I recommend this game? Yes... But it needs a lot of work. Perhaps if a ton of people buy it and play it, they'll invest a little more effort into making it worth our time. As for right now, it seems kind of like a niche thing where only nostalgia-minded folks who want to team up with a few buddies will want to play.Also, maybe allow for four players?

It's more a platform to be social with a few people than an actual game that can keep you busy for hours and hours with a heap of content. You can try other classes if you want, I suppose. The devs don't update it anymore. I'm guessing the max level cap is still 32, even though they had been saying years ago that they were updating it to 40.

It almost doesn't even feel right reviewing a game like this. It seems so, ""perfect"". There are those who are kind of on the edge of whether to get this or not though, so a review seems in order. Really the only question that you need to ask yourself is this, ""Do you like retro RPGs?"". If you do not I doubt you would like this, but if, however, you do, I would seriously reccomend it. The game takes some getting used to, but if you give it some time it will reward you greatly. Also, the game is even better with friends, so if you can get a few to join you then you should have a blast! Adding on to this is the promise of free future updates and add ons! So it looks like one will never run out of things to do. A few things need fixing, but I am sure that it isn't anything that will be left unfixed.

Gotta say that it is a really entertaining game.Spent a little time with the Ninja character and liked it a lot.  Solid throwback mechanics with a nice level of modern MMO complexity layered in.  The music and sound effects are a real plus and do a great job of pushing that nostalgic feeling.  I love the turn-based combat, rare to see executed so well these days.  The core gameplay is spot on and the deep skill trees were interesting. I will be putting some good hours into this, a new fun game to play with friends.  Not sure how it will handle online with other players, but I did a local game and had a blast.   EDIT: Have since played online and the experience is fun, just get some lag hiccups.Anyway, to sum it up - good game, fun gameplay, great music - recommed that you buy it if you have any love for the old turnbased RPGs from the past - some extra touches would really put this over the top.  I can't wait to see the developer continue to polish this title.A few hiccups that I observed:I didn't like that I created a name for my character and the name got truncated on the character select and battle screens, Ninjarius became Ninjariu, a little bit of a letdown. Made me wish I had chosen a shorter name, why allow so many characters if you can't see them all?Also, I am used to tooltip information being a little more accessible in my games.  I think when you select the ability you will use (in the battle screen), I'd like to know what it does - just a short description would be fine.  I had no idea what the ""Essence"" ability did til I took the time to go to the abilities tab and then opened the combat abilities tab and had a read.  This had to be done out of combat, which made a largely straighforward game a little murky.  Make the tool tips a little more comprehensive and/or add an arrow to get a more detailed bit of info about the skills.  It can be a little rough in the beginning when you're getting new skills and you have no idea what they are.Thirdly, I would like to see the party member that takes damage have their portrait flash when they take damage, it is easy to get overwhelmed by the text streams, so that little extra visual cue would help.  Its like how the enemies that get hit get an animation on them as a visual reinforcement.Finally, the game would benefit from mouse movement.  My reasoning is that it feels like the game was meant for a controller but once you start playing it the need for the mouse and keyboard becomes evident and really approprate. Playing it with a controller would be really tough.  Example, clicking and holding would have the character go in that direction, whereas point and click would not be right for this game.  I find myself clicking the screen to move, but it just doesn't work!   I'd like to see an option to move with the mouse as well as the WASD keys."

I owned this game before the Steam release (probably another 400-ish hours, maybe even more, it's been so long) and was great. Among the countless hours before and after Steam release was a whole massive ammount of fun, I've met great people and others that are... not so great.... As every other game (either on Steam, or other gaming services), there is always that one person who likes to cause some kind of trouble, this can be avoided if you are on a PvE server instance; on a PvP instance, you would just have to be careful about getting owned outside of a town by another player who wants to kill everyone he sees by force.The game can be a really great experience and also some harsh ones. With at least two classes, you will want to run into bosses to give you an excuse to leave the game, however if you make some buddies that tend to grind through multiple places of the map (each ""region"" is a different difficulty for certain characters, such as a wizard will be better in a ""mage"" - like enviroment where a soldier may have a harder time in that same enviroment) and help you get around easier.This game also offers a set of ""Local"" servers (essentially servers you create(you use your own HDD space for the files and such) and host(if allowed), which you can play with some friends IRL(I recommend a PassWord) and play separately from the community) that you can grant yourself ""administrator"" rights and put certain events on, such as Halloween or Easter. Playing alone has advantages, such as not having to deal with trolls, events that can last an extended time period, and ""speed"" of playing the game. Please Note: the game is in 8-bit which causes a max frame-rate of 20-ish(highest I've seen has been 25).Since the game doesn't require a heavy system(high-end CPU or GPU), you can play this game on almost everything. There are countless hours of fun you can have with this game, along with quite a few that are possibly making you feel like you want to stop playing for some time.The reason I purchased this game on steam was for a secondary account(actually third account) and still have a great time on all the accounts I use. From my knowledge, you do have to create an account with the service BYOND which links that account with your Steam account(via the stand-alone client of the game) which essentially tells BYOND that you bought a game through Steam and have the status of your account to something along the lines of ""Purchaced Game"" or ""Subscribed""All in all, the game can be the best experience of a retro-feel game! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a ""throw-back"" game."

No problem right? Weeeell you need about 600 exp and you gain about 3 a fight with the local slimes outside. Thats about 200 fights, by the way, of doing nothing except pressing 1 to pick attack and then 1 to select your target.The game adds skills and magic but MP doesn't recharge so thats a rest at the inn for you. That will be 3 gold. Not bad except the slimes only drop 2 gold and your first armor can cost as much as 450 gold if you picked warrior.It gets really dull, really quickly and this is only the first town! Theres a whole world out there to explore chump! So mouse is dead, move onto bandits and...I'm dead again. Bandits require you to be about level 9 and that armor you saved up for? Not as useful as you might have hoped now that enemies come in waves of 5 so you guessed it, back to grinding for you.The game isn't all bad, for example you can recruit some of the monsters and they make pretty decent party members and what a good job too because outside of other players, they are the only party members you get! They also don't get to wear equipment so you decide if thats a positive (less gold grinding) or a negative (less overall stats).And finally don't bot. Or appear to be botting at least. If the idea of pressing A,D,1,1 for 50 hours sounds a bit dull for you then I have bad news for you, it is dull. It was dull back then and its dull today. Old NES RPGs had something though, first of all they were all we had unless you owned a PC and second of all while the grind was a way to pad the game out, they normally had a story and events going on that should make you want to play on. Not everything was gated behind a grindfest at every turn, just to pad out the game. Here, grinding is the game and just like being in detention, you are expected to sit and do it and don't complain.When I played, there were no more than 10 people on at ANY given time and while I think the game isn't terrible, I do feel it deserves better than 10 people playing but I can also accept that it probably did have more than 10 people at one time and the refusal to either make the story captivating or to reduce/remove the grind is what lead to the husk we have today.Just as a final note, you can download the game for free outside of Steam although that is probably level capped or something.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews"

Has everything a good MMO should have, it just needs more players. It's currently averaging 7 players online on the official server. You can also host a private server for you and your friends without your friends having to purchase a copy!"

I bought a three pack for multiplayer but even when you get the game up and running, your friends have nothing to do but select one move per turn in battle. There's another unbelievable, impossiby bad flaw - your party members cannot see the text when you talk to townspeople. They literally sit there and watch nothing while you play the game alone. This game spits in the face of multiplayer. I wouldn't even have played this game when I was a child. Stay away."

I think this might be acceptable for a FREE game but for a premium priced ($15) indie game, this is totally unacceptable. I dont know how others are playing the game this way, Im a huge retro gamer and DQ, FF and Zelda on the NES have no such issues like this - they run smoothly on 30 year old hardware! This game definitely DOES NOT have the official NINTENDO SEAL OF QUALITY. Such a shame, cause it looks like fun."

The story seemed like it would have been pretty good, and i liked the NES style. It had a lot of potential for a game. HOWEVER, this game is simply UNPLAYABLE. You heard me, unplayable. As soon as you get into the game, everything seems fine. Nice NES graphics, nice sountrack. Everything is fine. But then you try to move. The engine for this game must be TERRIBLE, because moving is a task.MOVING. Moving should NEVER feel like a chore in a game. Some of you may be wondering what i mean by this. When you try to move, your character stands there and walks in place. The character then teleports 5-10 seconds later, sometimes more. The time it takes to walk is even unpredictable at times. And it's not only with walking. When you click to attack, it does the same thing. 5-10 seconds later(or more), it finally attacks. This makes the process of walking and fighting very tedious. Instead of feeling like i'm in an epic battle, I feel like i'm waiting for the battle to be over. Think of school: you just can't wait for the slow day to be over. That's what this game is. PLEASE don't waste your money on this game. Even on a sale, this games wasn't worth it. Until the developers fix this, then I might as well have wasted my money on a 100$ pinball game."

Its fantastic to play while talking on Skype because the game allows for indepth coordination due to its layout and organization in battles and as a whole. Its also super easy to join a party, leave a party, assist teammates in and out of battle, and ontop of all of that you can still use your companions while in a group with two friends! SERIOUSLY, BUY THIS GAME. PLAY IT ALONE, PLAY IT WITH FRIENDS... IT DOESN'T MATTER! ITS FUN FOR THE WHOLE FRAMILY!I also love the 8-bit look of the game, gives me a nostalgic feel. The inventory system and companion systems are well made. The party system is phenomenal. The quests are hilarious, what more could one want? BUY BUY BUY FOR THE LOVE OF BALZACKIA, BUY!"

Have been waiting a long time for someone to make a old style turn based Final Fantasy game in a MMO world with PVP. The PVP is a great addition and is one of the major factors why I bought it.Also like how it hasn't gotten bogged down in a massive story. You can jump in and start playing. Also the range of classes is good too.The only things I'd like to see different would be more of a 16bit graphic style with a bit more depth and also for the battle scenes to be more side on than the front on perspective. But these are just personal preferences and it's great someone finally got around to making this kind of game. I think there's a lot of people who have been waiting for a turn based MMO with PVP and considerable depth.

The gameplay is amazing and because it has very low graphics, I can even play this on my netbook! The replayability is also very high. The game does feature tournaments and has already been out since 2012 as far as I've heard/seen so it's not something entirely new. It does however have some problems, sometimes I'll freeze(and no I'm not talking about when I play on the netbook).In all I'd give this game a 9/10."
