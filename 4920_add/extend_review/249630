This game has an absolutely fantastic shell for a great game. The gameplay feels wonderful, the textures and visuals are top notch, the simplistic yet addictive item/loot/stats systems all work. The random generation of worlds is passable (although still could about ten times as many prefab chunks.HOWEVER.It's extremely light on content. I don't know if that's because they are leaving that to last, however i blew though this game in 18 minutes. And I did not rush. I did die about 20 times before I finished it, so my total playtime is a few hours. That is still absolutely horrible compared to ANY other game of this type out there. Even very cheaply made games like rouge shooter have 100 times more content than this game. It needs more levels. Bigger levels. More items, more scaling. Etc.It's like a demo version of a game. And I am kind of scared that they are just going to tweak systems until release, instead of releasing actual game length.The game needs to be streatched across a wider canvas, make the drops scale very slowly upwards, make the levels huge with multi areas leading to the floor down, so we can explore sprawling levels if we wish, instead of these tinny little dungeons. Right now, because this game has the core mechanics of a 10/10 indie game. I am going to recommend this game. However if the content is the same as it is now, at release. Then I'll be changing my recommendation."

Been playing it since it was in it's Alpha stages and was free and since then this game has improved A TON. Every run is randomly generated and you never know what you're going to find or have to go up against. Every level you go gets harder and harder and if you don't have very good gear or arnt leveled up alot, then you're not going to last very long (Especially on the trip back.) The replayability of this game is great too. It hasnt gotten old and I have yet to beat it. (The trip back is extremely hard if you don't have alot of HP pots, Good wands and really good armor.) I give it a 9/10. Definitely worth my $8.PS: This game is still in beta, but the Devs seem to have some great ideas coming up like shops, more levels, classes and other things. So if you're worried about content, stop worrying. There's alot more to come and this game has a ton of potential.EDIT: (11/30/2014) The game is still being updated and is still improving drastically. With the addition of 2 hand slots and destructable boxes along with a ton of new room layouts (Namely the caves, they've been completely re-done to look 100 times better.) Everything i've said before still stands and i'd still reccomend getting this. It's a great buy!"

The game starts you with a random inventory (one weapon, one food, one magic item, and some gold) and you can talk to a few NPCs to hear about the dangerous dungeon ahead. You head inside and explore the dungeon killing enemies and collecting progressively better loot until eventually, you die. When you respawn, thinking that all hope is lost, you realize that your gold from your previous life is still with you. You also realize, going into the dungeon, that it's different each time. The Camp where the npcs live in the beginning has many shops and the dungeon is endless and randomly generated. You can collect and save your gold to buy better loot in the town or just find as much as you can before you're killed in the dungeon.

It's strikingly similar to Minecraft, yet different. While Minecraft focuses on exploration and diversity (biomes, items, creatures, etc.), the developers of this game only chose to focus on dungeon exploration with little creativity in respect to monsters, items, and biome.I understand content takes time to add, but this game is already in beta, lacks a solid update history, and most importantly - diversity in monster, characters, and items. Let's get real, this game has been out since 2013 and it is now 2016 - So where's the content?While this game may provide fun for a short while, I would stay away from this one until the developers can get their act together.Consumers work hard for their money and deserve a polished game - this one is just not there yet."

And just when you say ""This game is fun,  but a bit easy"", it will brutally murder you and take all your stuff, leaving you only with coins and questions.Being entirely randomly generated, from the size of each floor to the quality of each weapon, there is exellent replay value.   Each floor has a mix of challenging enemies and total pushovers, keeping the experience fun throughout the playthrough as the difficulty slowly raises. That is, until a sudden surprise right near the end ;)For its price and file size, the game is a fantastic little timewaster that is very easy to pick up but very hard to put down.

It's a good addition to your library.  It's simple enough to start playing when you have limited time or attention, but robust enough that you don't feel like you're playing an indie throwaway.  Its randomized levels provide replay value and the ability to stockpile gold between runs allows for you to splurge on a run to give yourself a head start.  Also, the developer is very active.  It's obvious Delver is a labor of love.Some tips, for new players:1. Your HP refills when you level up, so stockpile your food in early levels.2. If you inventory is getting full, leave a treasure trove of food and wands at the ladder down to the next floor.3. Heavier armor slows you down, but not as much as you might think.4. When leveling, I prioritize Health > Attack > Speed.  I've never put points into the stats that buff wands or archery.5. Zombies and caterpillars (but not spiders, as of when I wrote this) will poison you with their attacks."
,Recommended,249630,7797683,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,va_roman_90,"I'm enjoying the game immensely.  It's quite simple to pick up and understand, you can play it for 5 minutes or 5 hours and it's always fun.  If you end up dying (which will likely happen a lot for the first few tries) you restart at the camp and go through a new dungeon with randomized equipment to start but gold carries over from each life.  There are 2 shop characters in the camp outside, 1 for general equipment (armor, weapons, potions, etc) and the other for scrolls that might come in handy.  Generally use the wands when you have them and you'll last longer.  Anything ranged works best.Overall I'd give the game 9/10.  I only drop it by 1 cause it's a little repetitive over time but still quite fun even with the simple graphics which I find perfect for the game and it's style of play.  It's also not a super expensive game and as of the time I played it I didn't notice any bugs through about 6 levels of the dungeon.  Everything seems to function like it's suppose to and makes it a wonderful game."

Sure, I almost rage quit a couple times, but that's just video games. I like that you dont customize your character because if you did you would be way more upset with dying (which you do QUITE A BIT). No two dungeons are the same, and you face new challenges and get new rewards with every delve into the myserious ruins. Some rooms are the same each play (just the rooms with transition ladders, however), yet the game never runs out of surprises or fun. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the dungeon crawler genre, pixelated graphics, or adventure games in general.P.S. : you can not jump in this game, space is just another attack key. I learned this the hard way, with the help of a gap, ledge, and pool of lava."
76561197979669620,Recommended,249630,20512416,"Posted: 13 January, 2016",all,Niro,"Pretty decent game. It still needs work and I honestly think you should hold out for a release because it's been four months since the last word on development and honestly this game is barely worth $8 in it's current state. It's a pretty engaging game if dungeon crawls are your thing. It's got all the stuff that makes a dungeon crawler wonderful.I enjoyed it a lot but I have a couple gripes:First, this game is like all the other roguelike-likes. It has randomly generated levels and some light RPG mechanics and that's it for likenesses. I would love to have a roguelike-like that doesn't distance itself so heavily from roguelike mechanics, but what can you do.Second, the difficulty spikes through the ceiling at the end. The game's really easy for something that bills itself as a roguelike game, up until the very end. It's really frustrating to work your way through the game for an hour or two only to hit an unbeatable ending that throws the cheapest difficulty it can at you: flooding the rooms with spawns of endgame enemies at a rate of ~1/sec(that's an honest estimation, not an exaggeration). I'm all for reasonable progression of difficulty, and this ain't it.Overall, I kinda-sorta recommend this game. It definitely needs work, but I think you'll find some enjoyment out of it in its current state. Whether that enjoyment is worth $8 is debatable. I would personally suggest you wait for more work to be done on it before buying."
,Not Recommended,249630,8134639,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,Tom Spanks,"Delver looked good. I heard a good review and it was on sale so I checked it out. I beat the game in 74 minutes. After learning some basic strategies, enemies became super predictable and completely unthreatening. At no point was there any fear or tension. I killed the boss without even realizing his significance. With no enemy scaling, leveling health and decking myself out in good armor made me essentially unkillable. Even barring that, the endgame whoopsie do of having to run back through the entire level refilled with monsters was a cakewalk. You could run circles around them and not get hit. On top of that, the twist ending bored me. There was no presentation to it, no aplomb, no reason to care about it.I have no reason to come back to this game. I have seemingly seen all there is to see in it. I enjoyed my time delving, but have been given no reason to ever come back to it. There is no point to this game being a roguelike, which was the entire reason I wanted to play it in the first place. Even if there is some second and third layer of fun I could come back to, it's not evident. Character progression is not saved. There is no reward for beating the game.I had fun. I was expecting so much more. The money per time enjoyed ratio is higher than a longer theatrical release. That's not what I've come to expect out of games."

,Not Recommended,249630,10906143,"Posted: 28 June, 2014",all,Alix,"This is one of those games that don't look as fun as the playthroughs of it. I was in love with the graphics, but the charm soon wears off, within only three hours for me personally. Regaurdless, don't be completely deterred from this game by my review. You can still get some enjoyment out of it (though I would never recommend it at full price). Don't have high expectations though. After watching several playthroughs of the game and seen what I thought was a ton of fun, I was disappointed with the actual product.I've seen this being described as a ""a rougebased 3d RPG game with permadeath"" To put it more basic, it's a dungeon crawler at it's simplist. There's nothing complex about it. Explore the dungeon fighting enemies, leveling up, and picking up loot like weapons, food, potions, and armor. So anyone can jump into it right away. However it's not exactly easy either. In the beginning I struggled with not succumbing to foes as it's an art to get close enough to hit an enemy with your beginning weapon (a very short dagger) without getting attacked yourself every time. You have to be at just the right distance to hit them without getting hit back, and since you only start with a mere 8 HP, it can be tough for new players, but it's just something to get used to. The goal of the game is to descend down 7 floors, defeat a boss, collect an orb from him, and to work your way back up the 7 floors to leave without dying.Some people have said the game is very easy, and that they were able to beat it in a mere hour or less. I've had a hard time with it, and I'll explain why. It's typical logic that you need to be a high level the farther you advance. Althoguh other players may disagree about this with me, I've found that I've needed to grind, or else I'm just not leveled up enough the deeper into the dungeon I get. The big problem with this is that it's almost impossible to grind in Delver. After you clear the floor the first time, enemies will continue to spawn a little (for a short time), but they'll spawn less and less until they stop all together. When I backtrack, I only run into a few to zero enemies, which means I have to go back and forth on a floor over and over again to try to level up. It's a very slow process.I also have to cover the two glitches I noticed. The first thing I noticed was how very laggy such a graphically simple game was, and then I noticed more specifically, it was lagging in time with the music. I had to turn the music off because it really slowed down the game. Maybe it's just my laptop and won't happen to all computers, but I figured I would give the heads up to people. The sound effects worked just fine however, and I want to mention the nice touch it added to the gameplay. The enemies would say phrases like ""I heard something"" and ""What was that?"" that would make you aware of their presence. Now you could still be spooked by an enemy, because some enemies wouldn't make much noise, but it did cut back on the startling surprise. The second glitch only happens in the caves, which are the 3rd and 4th levels in the game. The cave walls are very uneven and blocky, over all very odd looking. It's not easily clear where you can fit through and where you can't. Quite a few times, I got a little too close to just the side of the wall when I was walking, and I immediately got stuck. I refused to start over, and so I would spend 10-15 minutes trying to get myself free. For anyone else who experiances this, first take off your helmet, and then repeatedly use a weapon (I found the dagger most helpful) to hit either above or below you while holding in the key to go backwards. It's very tedious and annoying, and there are no changes to show your progress, but all at once you'll be free. The very last time however, I got stuck for good and tried for probably a half hour to get out to no avail. There's nothing more frusterating then losing precious progress.There are three other minor things worth mentioning. You collect gold, but you can't buy anything during that playthrough. Instead, the gold carries over when you die, and you can buy items the next round, before you enter the dungeon again. The way you leveled up bugged me. There are six different attributes, but when you level up, only three available ones show up, randomized each time. If you want to upgrade a certain skill, it often isn't there to choose. There are also different kinds of pressure plates in the game. Some hurt you, but one kind is a teleportation pad that will teleport you to a random place in the level. In all my time of playing, I have not once come across a single teleporter. I wondered if they had removed it in an update, but there are places in the level that you can not physically reach yourself.You'll see in other reviews that this game doesn't have a lot of replayability. I didn't believe this at first, but it rings true. You'd think a game with randomly generated dungeons would have endless fun, but it actually gets old fast. I can't put my finger on as to why, but it does. Perhaps it's *too* simple, and needs something more to spice it up. It's still in it's beta state (at the time of writing this review) so I won't knock it off yet. It still has time to grow and evolve. I personally did not enjoy it a lot, but I feel like other players will get more, longer lasting fun out of it than I did because I'm very picky about dungeon crawlers. They are definately not my favorite genre, so that may have contributed to why I didn't enjoy this game more. For the record, this game isn't horrible or even bad. I just thought it was okay, and that's the only reason I'm not recommending it, but that's just my own opinion. It is surely possible to enjoy this game, so give it a try if you've had your eye on it.Useful guides:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=219609427http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=198620967for the basic tips and inventory sectionhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234835170a more specfic, common strategy"

Its combat and item systems are pretty well made and the difficulty progresses fairly as you progress. Since this game is in early access, there are obviously going to be new things added soon most likely, and the game is made in a way where it is very open to new things, which is what I really enjoy about it. Even though death means you start all over, you don't have to always start completely from scratch, as you keep your collected gold and can buy powerful items from the start if you wish to do so, which is another thing real enjoyable about this game. Overall, my early access rating would have to be 9/10. If you really enjoy roguelike games, this game is an amazing approach to it, and any fans of the genre would definitly enjoy this game."

I even got my sister to play it. I appreciate the graphics as it's become its own style.  The music is fitting and very importantly not annoying since I will be hearing the same tunes for a while. The combat is satisfying since enemies literally just obliterate when dying (and not to mention how bad I feel for the bats when they squeak). Some of the weapons and skills could use a description and perhaps there can be more interaction with the environment such as breakable boxes rather than unbreakable ones. A lot of this is just fine tuning and my opinion, though.There isn't much to spoil in this game as all of it will unravel as you start playing. It was worth my 8 dollars for sure."

For what this game is, it looks and feels very, very nice. The pixel art, engine, and polish on this game are all very well done, and the beginning of the game left a pretty good taste in my mouth (which may be more than some people say for my game, Barony). However, this game simply has no depth to it. The music is very limited and loops constantly, so even though it sounds nice at first it gets tiring quickly. There are no skill trees, there is no diversity in each playthrough, and the mechanical variety of the game is just so low -- it's hard to describe, but gameplay-wise, there's no MEAT to this game.I was not aware that this game even existed when I made my own first-person ""roguelike"", and I've only just now played it, so I fully admit I may be biased -- but after having beaten this game, as well as coming away from it from an initially positive impression, I have to say I am not too impressed with this game now.

I have played little more than an hour of this game so far, but I can already sum up everything I have to say about Delver in one word: Potential.Delver is a fresh, unique take on the rogue-like games that have been pouring in recently from many indie developers from all over the world. It takes on many thematic rogue-like elements: It's challenging, randomly generated, and as fun as a bag full of rabid chipmunks dumped into an elementary school.I'm not saying this game is without its issues, but it's still in its early access phase, and must be taken with a grain of salt. Considering this fact, Delver is chocked full of endless potential. Its first-person perspective and highly pixelated environment and graphics allow this game far more room to breathe then one would expect at first glance. Even in its early phases, the amount of different consumable items and pieces of unique equipment are quite impressive, and the level-up system that resets after every miserable failure allows a very immersive RPG-like quality to the game. You're able to play differently every single run. Want to focus on high armor and melee combat? Go right ahead! Feel like going for a more mobile, long-range bow combatant? Be my guest! Or maybe you just want to pump all of your points into magic and blow the CRAP out of every enemy in sight with one of the many different elemental weapons in the game. Why wouldn't you?!It is this amount of flexibility within a game that is comprised of so little options as of right now that makes me positive that there's no where to go but up from here for Delver. So many environments yet to be created; so many monsters yet rendered in that simplistic-yet-beautiful art style; many more items, potions, and pieces of armor yet to be looted off of bandit corpses or found in the dank corner of a cave! Heck, there is even a large part of the Delver community that claims this game has everything it needs to move on to an online co-op mode!

,Recommended,249630,30699856,Posted: 24 March,all,Sartor Resartus,"Puzzled how this game is still Early Access.Delver is pretty decent. I'm not floored by much of anything but it's managed to keep my attention for more than 10 minutes, and with all the un-played games in my library that's a compliment. Visually it's fine to look at, the art style is a mix of 3D environments that have a definite Minecraft vibe, whereas enemies and items are 2D sprites - although the animation on them is well done and actually useful in predicting attacks to get timing down.The soundtrack is great although turning off the music can be useful as almost every enemy gives away it's position with some basic sounds. Combat is alright, although it feels a little sluggish - even when you're wielding something light and quick like a dagger. Magic is much more satisfying and useful, but there's not a lot of it. The same can be said of bows and arrows. I think the game would be a lot more enjoyable and replayable if both magic and archery were viable ""builds"" on their own and not just supplements to melee.Nothing too fancy here, I would recommend this only if you were really looking for something in this style of game."
76561198004541820,Recommended,249630,18538900,"Posted: 17 October, 2015",all,Eurgiga,"Picked up Delver during the Steam Sale. Definitely worth the $3 it cost.I wouldn't call it '3d' in more than a limited sense, it feels a lot more like Doom's 2.5d- 3d environments, sprite monsters, etc. Still, it's one save file you can't back up and one life in a randomly generated roguelike. It actually makes for a pretty cool story:I started off in a little camp with a couple of shopkeepers and the obligatory guest appearance of Old Man Exposition, who explained that there was a MacGuffin at the bottom of yonder dungeon. He also seemed troubled that people kept going in but never coming out. More on that later.So I notice I have no gold, yet everything the shopkeepers sell costs gold. Okay, fine, we'll come sell some crap later. I head down the ramp, at which point the music changes to a far darker and more foreboding track. It was more apt than I realized, but I ignored it as I clicked on the door.Ten minutes later and I'm about halfway through the first floor of the dungeon, packing my inventory with goodies to sell. You get a pretty generous inventory, and I was crammed to the gills with extra armor and weapons to unload. A quick glance at my map and I headed for the exit. Reached the door... and it's locked. The key is the MacGuffin. ♥♥♥♥.I do a quick Google search and lo and behold, there is no selling of items to shops- any gear other than the best stuff you've got is essentially dead weight. I tossed half my inventory on the spot and continued downwards, making it three levels before getting vaporized in a headlong hasted charge on a Beholder. Thus ended Game One.A couple presses of the Return key later and I find myself back in the camp. My inventory looks a little different- a different starting wand, a gold potion instead of a red one (the potions randomize their effects every game and you have to find out which is which by drinking them- and one just happens to be poison; the game really does hate you). And now I find out why there's shopkeepers: My gold carries over between runs, so previous me can give current me a head start with some gear and a stat point or two. As I got ready and drank my starter potion to find out what it was (arcane shield this time), I remembered the old man's words:""There's a lot of people going in, but nobody ever comes out.""Over the next two hours I went in several times, and never came back out. Death happens a lot in this game- and usually right when you start to get cocky. I began learning to glance at my health bar every few seconds, more if I was in combat. Keeping myself in top shape was a priority- every level had its own special combination of ranged and melee mobs, and more often than not you'd find yourself beset by something with a sword that you'd have to kill while dodging fire from other things trying to vaporize you. Corners became my best friend- either because I'd lead the melee mob around them and out of the ranged mob's line of fire, or just as a place to sit down and cry now and then.Since it actually has a win condition, I can say I felt my pulse quicken and nerves get twitchier as I got towards the end. I'll try not to spoil much, but the game doesn't really get hard until AFTER you get the MacGuffin: now you have to get out. Oh, and did I mention that picking up the MacGuffin awakens the undead horde that's apparently buried under every square foot of this dungeon?For the last fifteen minutes I was continually mumbling ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; under my breath as I dodged through the dungeon towards the exit with the MacGuffin, hoping I'd invested enough speed while leveling up to outpace the horde of undead nipping at my heels (I hadn't, one type of undead in particular is fast, flies, and will bite your face off if ignored). Having to turn to kill the speedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I almost instantly found myself swallowed by the undead wave advancing behind me, forcing me to burn my two most powerful wands to blow a hole in their ranks and escape. It's at this step that preparation becomes critical: I'd carefully and methodically laid a cache of gear for myself at the lower entrance to every floor; a wand, a health item, and some protective potions awaited me in the short breath I had while the skeletons closed in from the darker parts of the level. Dumped the empty wands, got some regeneration going, and off it was again to try and make it through Skeletor's Funhouse without joining the ranks of my would-be murderers.By the time I got up the first floor again I was feeling good- I had a feeling that I'd be pretty worn down by this point, so I'd left an exceptionally generous cache on this floor. With no reason to hold back, I lined up every wand I had left and burned a path to the exit. Even then, so many mobs were in my way that I used up every wand and was still just outside the final room leading to the exit. The only mob in the way is one of the first-floor goons that happened to spawn, but my arrows were used up on the way down and my wands on the way up, leaving me with my trusty but oh-so-weak shortsword. I'd decided that I'd finesse my melee combat this playthrough, and as such had put all of my stat points into speed, magic, and health- I relied on careful maneuvering to win melee, a tactic you can afford on the way down.This was not the way down. This was the way up, and I had enough undead closing in on me to make Left 4 Dead blush. I have 60+ hp and am regenerating, but while I brutally stab the mob in front of me to death my health bar is getting gnawed to nothing. I was in the single digits when my victim finally keeled over and died, leaving me to burst unopposed through the chokepoint, leave my undead pursuers behind, and have the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic door-opening ever as I got to the exit, barely alive but victorious.So yeah, it's a fun game. Give it a whirl."

It runs smoothly, it's challenging at times, and you could play it for hours. I do fault it for having very rare updates, which handicaps the game getting out of early access, but that is more the dev's fault than the game's. But, the devs seem to have great ambitions for this game, so we can only hope. But, it still being in early access, there are some problems.

It felt reminiscent of Daggerfall's dungeons or early dungeon crawling games of the 90s except with modern controls and pacing. This isn't a turn based roguelike, which is hilarious refreshing in what is one of my favourite genres now bloated with similar games trying to cater to people who only care about what I said above  (memes indie 16-bit roguelikevmetrovai- blah blah blah etc etc).The aesthetics are crisp and colorful and some weapons feel weighty and it's very satisfying knocking out monsters or pesky mages into blood pudding. Also traps in the dungeons effect the bad dudes and I spent more than I'd like to admit trailing bandits into a spike pit.When you slap people's nuts a little too hard but not enough to put them down, they'll run off and try and flank/sneak up on you, which is cool.I put all my stats into defence and attack and wore big platemail armor. This worked pretty well until a bunch of spooky liches tore me a new one with magic while I was huffed and puffed trying to get away.Only downer is it's an early access game and could use some content or fleshing out. I made it down 7th or so floor before being lich target practice (apparently this is the last floor?).This game is under 10$ CDN, how can you say NO to this.I also smashed a bandit with a sword in the face with a hammer and it made a sound like he pooped himself while he flew off a cliff into lava from the blow.I give it 6 green potions out of cheese piece.YUM."

,Recommended,249630,29451458,Posted: 23 January,all,Yaridovich,"7/10A quite fun roguelike dungeon crawler, even though it has a very high frustration level involved.The premise is simple: you start a game, go in the dungeon, fight monsters, avoid traps, level up, find items and gear, then use what you have to get to the end of the dungeon, grab the orb and come back. Dungeons are randomly generated each time you go into a new level and even the potion effects are random each time you start a new game. It's simple enough, but not as easy to actually beat - could be perhaps described as ""easy to play, hard to master"", as you have to learn what stats work better for your play style, learn more about enemy behavior, wands and plan ahead to beat the game.As fun as the game is, there is a huge frustration level involved, not just because it's a roguelike game but also because of how the game works. The first reason is that the only thing carried over when you die is your money, which you can use to buy some starting gear, though that doesn't help much since gear will degrade with usage (specially weapons). The best thing you can buy is a potion that gives you an instant stat point to spend, but obviously it only lasts for one playthrough. The second reason is that sometimes the game can overwhelm you all of a sudden - maybe you're having a perfect playthrough, finding lots of good items and dealing with enemies one by one, then all of a sudden you find yourself in a situation where your health bar drops so quickly, you don't even notice it until you're dead. These sudden difficulty spikes make the game extremely frustrating at times.The game is currently on early access, so perhaps this issue will be addressed in the future, which might make the game a lot better than it currently is. Nonetheless, it's a fun and well made roguelike game."

Essentially this is Rogue if Rogue was a first person action game. You use various weapons, wands, potions, and food as to transverse down different styles of levels fighting various enemies - some that fly!Some of the best things about this game though is that it does well to allow for pattern recognition from enemies - allowing for skill players to dispatch enemies with deft movement and attacks. Its traps can be somewhat simple, but they can sometimes lead to some interesting situations - and a clever player can always 'trigger' them before stepping on them.In many ways, this is a very simple game as far as first person action rogue-likes go, and it has been somewhat slow to develop - being in Early Access long after Barony for instance was done. It doesn't have multiplayer and it can feel somewhat easy to play and should be easily beaten within the first few tries by more competent players. There is perhaps a bit of a lack in what you can do and experience for the price tag of the game.Overall I do recommend this game, though I wish there was more depth to it. As it is now it lacks somewhat in replayability - which for many players is going to be a glowing problem. But it does have the potential to be a fun little game to play if develop continues on it."

Since then there has been a significant graphical update (and a sale) which pushed me to buy it, and I do not regret it. Keep in mind, though that this is an early game, so there are still some unimplemented 'core' features.+ A real-time roguelike with engaging first-person combat. Very enjoyable combat.+ I do like that the levels have their own styles, rather than being the same shape with different art.+ The stats have a very definite impact on your gameplay.- I don't think there's enough variety in the random level generation to make it worth playing through more than once. Especially the damned sewer levels.- I don't think Delver (right now) has much replay value. I found just maxxing your Health to the exclusion of all other stats is really the most effective strategy. I did that, beat the boss, and practically waltzed back up to the surface, orb in hand, without a scratch. What did I have to show for it? Nothing except money. Exactly the same thing I would have had if I died to the end boss.- I never bought anything from the shop anyway. There's plenty of free loot in the dungeon, better than what you can buy. I found no reason to collect nor spend money. Maybe shops in the dungeon would help because I often need a specific item, like a potion or wand. I'm a big fan of the wands*. Please put in more kinds of wand.*Totally not guns.~ What if beating the Lich unlocked lower levels?~ What if lower levels unlocked more items from the shop/more shops?It's a fun game, which I enjoyed more than I expected to, but it is not done yet! Very playable, but feels empty and pointless once you've beat the Lich once. I was kinda hoping for a whole new dungeon to open up, but it's early days."

I think this was money well spent for the hour or so of enjoyment I got out of the game. Even buying it at full price, it would have paid for itself.The combat is pretty basic but it works well for the slow paced combat. The visuals are very reminiscent of Minecraft along with all the controls. The inventory system works well for allowing you to collect loot along your trip down the dungeon and the randomized potions give a little risk to using them each time you restart, which is frustrating but in a good way.As for faults, the level/stat system is a little broken as you only need to put points into health for the first five levels and defense the rest to become relatively hard to kill. Ranged combat versus flying enemies, which is when it's needed, is a fools game unless you're using a lightning wand (almost hit scan), as projectiles have travel time and flying enemies juke around way too much to predict their movements. I just found myself running up under them and stabbing upward for a sure hit.Finally, while I died the first time down the dungeon due to trying to figure out the system, I beat the game on the second try. I received a slash screen of text and then the game treated me like I had died. I'm pretty much not going down a third time until there are further updates, but as I said at the start, I got my money's worth already and I recommend a purchase, especially if it's on sale again.TL;DR - It's an enjoyable game but has it's issues.

It's rather basic at the moment, being early access, but for eight dollars, the amount of content and effort that the game has is really impressive, and it feels very focused in its design. I can see the reason people compare it to Ultima Underworld, since much of the game's gameplay and style are clearly very inspired by it - the first one in particular, I mean. While the combat focus is very fun and the graphical style is really appealing, I actually consider the level design and generation to be the highlight here: I don't know whether it's due to working with a 3D space or whether it's simply the sheer amount of rooms and halls and things that the team have made, but in the handful of runs I've played so far, they've all felt similar, but all memorably unique thanks to how everything is built. It's a roguelike capable of creating really cool vistas, structures and views, while also making those distinct in gameplay terms as well (the dungeon is inhabited and has lots of humans and recent structures, the caves are very jagged with lots of nooks, the sewers are a mixture of open yet linear due to multiple heights, etc), and that's something to be applauded."

As of this post, I played it a few times and quickly made it far; only dying to either burst (Didn't get enough health or armor), or my own stupidity. It's very short, which I suppose is a good thing for a game like this. It's easy, but you still can't face-check anything until you get lucky enough with weapons, armor, and stock piles of food / potions. It does get easier as the game goes on, which is a bad and good thing.The stronger you get, the less trouble you have and are capable of dealing with most creatures. But at the same time, before you get to that stage you struggle and have to back-peddle swing many monsters to survive. You do get a lot of wands I have noticed, which trivializes a lot of encounters; which should be their purpose. But the purpose is way too strong when you get a wand drop every other kill. And the mages almost always drop them, even if they are absolute crap -- it's a ranged weapon and you take 0 damage from back-peddling and killing the enemy.Stats are not very clear on what they do besides Attack, Speed, and Health. It's obvious you deal more damage with Attack, move faster when you up speed, and gain more health everytime you level it up. Agility was very vague on what it did, and I still don't feel the effects. The same goes for defense and magic. They feel either too weak to actually present themselves as useful, or are just not straight forward enough.I would recommend this game on sale. It's a decent time waster for a few hours, but it has very little to give after you play through it just a few times."

I got frustrated and put this game down only to forget about it and leave it uninstalled in my library for qutie some time until I decided to try again. This experience was much different. For those of you who don't know anything about this game, it is a dungeon crawler roguelike first person rpg with a game play that I like to relate to capture the flag. Once you enter the dungeon, you cannot leave until you recover the red orb about 7 floors down and with each level you go down (randomly generated levels of course), the enemy population and difficulty along with the number of hazards increases. Once you obtain the orb, the whole dungeon goes bat♥♥♥♥♥♥and you have to race to the top. So essentially you must play through each floor except the last floor twice and you will progress further with each playthrough. I cannot express how satisfying it is to obtain a new weapon or level up in a tough situation and every second of this game is worth the price.

The biggest appeal for me was the art style. The usual randomly generated levels, items and whatnot are all here. I finished the game but it seemed like it didn't matter how I was playing, it was all up to the numbers and being lucky. Maybe the game is intended for grinding, like a traditional RPG, but I ended up racing down as fast as I could to kill the boss, then snagging the orb and racing back to the surface. Fighting everything didn't really get me anywhere, especially when one little bump can knock you into a pit and that infamous ""permadeath"" everyone seems to love puts you back at square one. Maybe a quick tutorial or in-game guide would have helped me since it seems like there are also a lot of useless items to pick up in the game as well. As far as I could tell you can't sell anything at the shops, so why can I pick up cups and bowls? I dropped a book once that killed me, so maybe that's something.

Ive played through this game a ton of times and still havent beaten it. in spite of that, it still manages to keep its charm and not give the player (or at least me) any frustration. i feel like this is because of the games fairness, meaning, that each death feels justified in its own way. another good aspect of this game is its 3D environment. putting you into the action in first person has to be the best idea ive seen so far since ive never seen that in a rouge-like before. The 16-bit enemies and environment add a classic feeling to the experience almost as though the game was once in a fourth directional dungeon crawler like ""Link to The Past"". The randomized floors just add a bit more of anticipation to each floor. each enemy is unique in its own while still keeping a theme throughout the game. overall it is just an enjoyable experience and i always look forward to each gameplay and that is why i recommend this game to any interested.

Add to that a lack of most options (Just resume and quit from the escape menu in game) and a major lack of updates and you get an unfinished game that doesn't look to be ever completed.  To put it in perspective, this game has been around since 2013 with the last update coming almost a year ago and is still labeled as a beta in early access.  Much larger (and better) games have joined and left early access than this and it's a shame since I could imagine this game fleshing out into something akin to fun.

The game itself is a dungeon rouge-like, but is a first person game. One could say that Delver resembles Minecraft in quite a few ways, and I don't disagree. But, it's far from another Mincraft clone. The premise of the game is simple, the difficulty is not. As of this writing, the dungeon consists of seven levels/floors, each randomly generated. One must make it to the bottom, then return topside with the treasure, with various enemies being thrown at you along the way. However, the game does become monotonous at times, just to let you know. Again, it may sound like a cake-walk to some, but it really is the opposite. And although I'm used to multitudes of horror films, I jump every once and a while as a turn a corner. Recommended."

It's deceptively simple; three equipment selections with apparently-linear upgrading; you only choose whether to equip heavier armor at a loss of speed. Amulets and rings? Straightforward. Weapons? Same deal, though they can be enchanted for bonus elemental damage. All in all it seems like the sort of game you can fully-understand in 30 minutes or less.And then, on your second or third play(or fourth or fifth), you get far enough. And you realize there's a *purpose* behind what you're doing. Me, I thought you just got to wander, fight things, find gear, and satisfy that itch to hoard, but there's more! And if you thought it was hard going deeper and deeper.... just wait for the trek back up. But that's all I'll say, as I don't want to spoil anything.Delver is already well-worth the $7.99 it's currently selling for. The visuals are simple and remind me of Minecraft(despite not actually adhering to the same visual format at all), the sprite style is deceptively innocent, colors are vibrant and the lighting is very complimentary to the atmosphere. If you're like me, you'll find yourself creeping, ears sharp. What was that noise? Where did it come from, exactly? What made it??Like I said, it's worth the small price tag, and that's when you know an Early Access game deserves to be Early Access. This isn't a case of ""well, it's probably gonna turn into something great given time!"" at all. Delver is great, and if you want to pick it up now and get your money's worth early-on, then you'll already have it as it continues to grow bigger and better.

I think this is a fantastic game for beginners of the genre and even after you've spent some time with it, it never really loses its luster.

Sorry for typos.Delver is a very compelling game, with very good pixel graphic and vibe, but far from being finished. The ""random-levels creator"" sometimes still generates impassable walls, grates and windows that make the entire level impossible, and if you don't use some debug codes, you need to start over cause it's a rougelike.I myself got stuck in the Sewers just because a monster made me fall over a fence (I used a teleport scroll from debug mode to get out) and then again a couple of times in the Ruins, where 4 big columns simply blocked my way (I'm into this kind of games and there was no other routes).I don't like using codes to skip on, so after some time I simply decided to copy my save (the one who got erased if you die) every time I reached the end of a level, just to cringe my way down and see what's next.In the end, the gameplay itself is fun, the RPG part works just fine as do the monsters/objects/weapons, but sadly right nowI cannot recommend Delver 'cause your progress is based on luck. Moreover, other minor adjustments would be nice: joypad support, working surround sound (it's somewhat broken to me) and working fullscreen for a start (every time I lunch the game, I have to uncheck and recheck the ""fullscreen"" option). Then stackable objects, like food and potions to some extent (10 pieces?), and NEWGAME+ (ie: start with the same hero/object/weapons) if you finish the game... make it playable ""to infinity and beyond""!Anyway I've faith in the programmers: they just need some more testing to get rid of these ""impossible"" tiles and their big random puzzle will fall into place.Good luck guys!

It suffers from being a bit weak in scope, but the gameplay is tight. The ending is unbearably annoying, and only has one real playstyle you can do to beat it. I can only suggest the game for $2 or less.If you've ever played a ""real"" rogue-like, like Nethack (or other ASCIIs) you'll be very disappointed. The game is incredibly limited, the ""RPG"" element is ultrabasic, with only 2-3 stats actually being useful. There is no character magic, and the game scales pretty linearly. I actually got more out of building up in the first or second dungeons, because while deeper levels bring harder enemies, the rewards are worse.The author put in official mod support, though there is no Steam Workshop. I did not try any of that.Note on other's reviews: Only the first and second dungeons are ""procedurally generated"" in the normal sense. The others are randomized, but not completely random.

Go ahead and look for the company's twitter and the dates/frequency/content of posts if you wnat to get a better idea. Dont let the ""Early Access"" label get your hopes up.

This could vary machine to machine but just because your computer is othewise pretty good at what should be harder to process doesnt mean you wont get jarring stutters in this game. Reduction of particles does next-to-nothing to aleviate. There isn't even an update to change the pixel resolution at full screen, or any control customization/mouse sensitivity options whatsoever.Beyond that, the game does have interesting aesthetics but with enemies that could best be described as an annoyance, with melee combat that feels more like a batting range with softballs.

I never was able to find it and when it came on Playstation Store, I decided not to buy it in favour of Friday the 13th, the resulting situation ending in me hocking my PS4 due to a lack of customer support and quality control.Then I came to Steam and thought I may never know the fun of Eternal Ring again, Delver has proved me wrong. It's like a more accessable, minecrafty version. Endearing to me right from the start, I started to play not knowing much, learning that the potions work off of a RNG, just like DeathState, you can build your Delver from the first time you set foot in a dungeon until you happen to fall victim to some devious creatures or traps, at which point you must start from scratch - save for your gold... your sweet, sweet gold. This allows later playthroughs some leniency and sets you up so you can at least have an idea of how you are going to build your Delver for the current new playthough.In summation, buy this game! It's totally worth it for the price, if you don't like it you can just refund it, but I guarentee you'll find yourself dropping hours upon hours on it if you find it's your style. I've only played for about an hour and half at the time of writing but I can say I'll be putting many more hours in before I'm through. Happy delving, fellow Delvers!"

It's minimalisticly perfect in that it's not a super crazy fleshed out giant expedition but it has enough meat on its bones to not be played once and forgotten about. Speaking about replayability, it's on par with other huge games like The binding of Isaac and EtG in terms of how many times you can try your luck with RNG in terms of item drops and map layout in attempt to make it to the final boss (which is a good thing if you enjoy a healthy does of luck induced joy/frustration) It's also a perfect gaming for streaming/win-streaking for public amusement IMO... hint* hint*"

When buying arrows, I purchased an extra 10 that I did not have room for in my inventory.  The arrows appeared on the shop-keeper with the message ""Press E to Pick Up Arrows"" however, pressing ""E"" did not work, even after I emptied my inventory.3. Not being able to leave the dungeon.

It's features fun combat with procederaly generated maps (that are well designed). Runs are about 30 minutes to an hour + long depending on map layout and any gold you didn't spend that run gets carried over to your next one (Note that runs you did on save file x wont transfer to save file y or z). Beware the sewers however, I have gotten stuck on something there quite a few times and had to abandon my runs. Teleport scrolls are handy for this, but if you don't have one you might be able to get out by throwing out potions and smacking them (Hold w while doing this, also this doesn't work if you are stuck in the geometry or the floor your trying to get to is 2 stories high).

In the end, it feels like an incomplete game.

The dungeon generation, music, and art are fantastic and initially kept me coming back for more, but the better I become at the game, the more infuriating it is to play and the less I can motivate myself to adventure further.Money is useless. Not only is the drop rate absurdly low, but there are only two places to purchase items - at the beginning of the run, and just after the first two floors. It's ridiculous that I have to play 3+ runs to the boss just to get enough gold for one good item at the shop. And then the stores are so early that it's pretty much a waste to spend your money because you're bound to spend it all on that run where you accidentally get pushed into lava by a monster you didn't see. At the shop, you never feel like you're making a good run better.Weapons are impossibly underpowered. At least 50% of the melee weapons you find on a given run you won't even want as backup due to random stat penalties. ""Let's see, unholy dagger... +4 attack and -6 defense??"" It's very rare that I even put on armor I find because the speed penalties are similarly high to the point where it takes you 10 minutes just to walk across one floor without fighting (and as anyone who has played past the boss knows, speed is REALLY important at the end of the game). Then you have magic wands, which come in two varieties: 1) fireball, which are absolutely wonderful but only have 6-12 shots (and usually insta-kill you if you hit something that is in melee range), and 2) all the other wands that are bad because they do so little damage, no matter how much you level up magic.If that weren't enough, weapons break after a certain number of hits. Your inventory is way too small (24 slots) for the game to force you to carry around 6+ weapons because all the good (damage) weapons you found were in bad condition.Finally, endgame. Actually getting to the boss is a healthy and enjoyable challenge. But then enemies pretty much flood out of the walls. Before the last few updates I was able to get ALMOST all the way back to the top of the dungeon. As of the last update, I can't get out of the boss room. I just had an amazingly lucky run with all the right items - I beat the boss, spent about 10 minutes in that room hacking away with my best weapon, gained 3 levels (each level gains you all your HP back), broke that weapon and 2 more, and then died because the enemies were simply spawning too fast for me to walk out the narrow hallway. My stats were 56 HP, 30 AC, something like 30 ATK with a fast-attacking Dusk and at least +2 default speed (with full armor). Every time I would get halfway down the path, enemies would continue to spawn and attack me from behind, forcing me to retreat and clear my back.It's an addicting experience with a great foundation, but ultimately until the endgame (among other issues) gets fixed, I can't recommend a game that makes you feel like you've wasted your time with impossible goals. If I had gotten out of the dungeon, I don't even think I would have felt the victory. Only thing that can get you out right now is lucky enemy spawns and running, which any monkey with a Shift key could pull off eventually."

The game allows little room for building your character as you progress, and you are left at the game's mercy when it comes to gear. As you progress deeper into the games dungeon, your play style will rely almost solely on what weapons and armor you find and your luck with the random level generator.Still, the game is a real-time roguelike experience, and much like classic roguelikes, you will often find yourself backpedaling into doorways while trying to kite varied and numerous enemies. It's easy to catch yourself reserving all of your ranged attacks (wands rely on finite charges and bows rely on a rare stock of arrows) for dire circumstances, while searching constantly for a better melee weapon. Armor can be hit or miss, and is often a trade-off between movement speed and protection (both of which are very effective).From death to death, your gold will carry over. The only opportunity to buy items and spells is at the beginning of each run. While the dungeon is currently very short (only seven floors), the environments are nicely varied and the randomly generated rooms keeps it feeling fresh with each attempt. It's worth the price."

However, this game consists of many flaws that ruin the gameplay.1. No Jump Buttons2. Bats that have the glitchiest movement patterns in any game.3. Crazy damage after picking up the Orb, I had full platemail and 60 health, but monsters were still dealing like 6-8 damage! Not the melee, I was fine with that, but the mages were just shooting spell after spell after spell, you couldn't even say ""I'm dead"" before you're dead.This is supposed to be a rogue game, but only problem. UNFAIR CHALLENGE, you want something fair? Go play Crypt of the Necrodancer, and avoid this abysmal failure for ""challenge"".P.S: This is Early Access, so it will have bugs, but this is way TOO many."

I highly recommend playing it if you enjoy fantasy-themed dungeon crawlers or rogue-likes.It runs smoothly with very few glitchs/bugs, and has a great art style and enemy design with excellent semi-randomized levels. The music is spectacular, being in a ""simplistic retro"" style. The only issues I experienced were with some of the newer levels creating inescapable sub-sections (because of ladders not generating). Player level progression could use an overhaul, since some stats and playstyles don't feel powerful enough, but nothing feels blatantly overpowered, so that can get fixed easily.The game feels complete until halfway through, and without spoilers after that there are several levels which ATM feel like ""kill screens"" in that they are so small, with the enemy spawn rate being so high, and being in claustrophobic environments.Once you beat the game (or die) your equipped items, inventory, and character levels dissapear, with only your gold being preserved. So a ""level+"" mode would be a nice touch for beating the game. Also ATM you can buy items from shops, but not sell.It also has a simple but effective level editor, if you're into that."

It's a simple game that has great potential and I hope that it will be continued to be expanded by its author. As it is, it's relatively short. I finished it on my third try. The first time I didn't know what I was doing and died quickly. The second time I was more careful and made it to the end, but didn't realize I was near the end, and so I died again. The third time I was prepared, and beat the game. The gold / buying stuff is handled in an interesting way; the gold you collect can only be used to buy things in the NEXT game you play. So while you don't keep levels, items, etc after you die, you do gain an advantage the next time. There are a few annoying things, which will hopefully get fixed in later versions. Some are glitches, like enemies getting stuck in walls. Others are interface things; I found switching between weapons in the middle of combat didn't always work as well as I'd like. However I'd say that Delver is worth buying ... I probably won't play it again until it's next update, but I'm looking forward to doing so."

So, I set out and invested many hours exploring that place, combatting all manner of terrors in pursuit of a goal that quickly slipped from my mind and escaped beyond the shadows my meager light could not uncover. It's been many years since that time, and I grow weary to make another attempt on that place. But, now I hear rumor of another ruin, filled with treasures and fiendish traps, as well as maddened explorers who have become trapped in that place. Knowing what fate must surely await me should I not be careful, I stepped beyond that unassuming wooden door, dagger in hand, and pressed on into the darkness. But yeah, anyway, I got ultima underworld by chance with a PC Gamer magazine, and it was great. Delver immediately reminds me of it in style, but with a better interface and faster, shorter gameplay. While I might wish for a little more depth in terms of things to find or do with my character, I can't argue that there isn't already plenty to get the job done.

76561197979061816,Recommended,249630,8536273,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,Scrooloose,"Delver is definitely worth playing. Think, Legend of Grimrock meets Minecraft...You'll start off as an adventurer in a camp with a random set of gear to get you started. This camp holds shop keepers who can sell you items that will help you on your way, the catch is you probably can't afford anything they sell.Ok so, the deal is this... You start with basically nothing, a pair of ""useless pants"" and leather armor, an iron dagger, a random magic wand, and a random potion. This means no money, and very little to get you going. However as you play through Delver's brilliantly crafted, procedurally generated levels you'll find gear pretty quickly, and also gold. Once you enter the dungeon there is no leaving until you complete the dungeon, or die. I.E. no going back to to town to restock potions or buy new items.What use is there in having a town in the first place? Well, when you die you lose everything and start a new random dungeon, --but you keep your gold--. So should you die, perhaps you can now afford to buy an amulet with extra armor, or a better weapon to start with. Maybe a scroll of healing, or if you have enough money you can purchase a ""skill in a jar"" basically a level up. So camp can be pretty helpful if your just having a rough time finding things to get you through. Just keep in mind when you die again these items are lost.So far Delver has only seven floors. I'm hoping that the devs will add more in the future or perhaps make a sort of new game plus mode. In the meantime though, these seven floors are challenging. Hallways, blind corners, randomized traps, enemies from nowhere, and darkness work together to foil your attempts to make it to the next floor. When you finally do make it the floor seven and find the treasure you then have to fight your way back to the top floor with harder enemies spawning all around you.Fighting your way back to the top is almost panic inducing, as you will quickly find yourself scrounging for everly last item, potion and scrap of food, making the final door to the end of the game feel pretty damn satisfying, and fueling an urge to do it all over again.For the love of all that is good play Delver.I for one am looking ever forward to more and more updates to what promises to be a great old school dungeon crawler."

The first couple of levels are easy but later levels include more agile and clever enemies, especially ranged enemies that like to circle strafe and are difficult to hit.  I'm actually impressed by the conversion of a roguelike to the first person perspective as a lot of roguelike tactics have converted seamlessly: move conservatively, use your items liberally, and lure enemies into hallways to fight them one at a time.When you die, you lose all your equipment but your gold carries over, allowing you to purchase items at the surface shop.  There are a couple of issues I have with the overall design that stem from the simplistic nature.  Specifically, the attributes are seemingly useless with health being the most important as your HP does not increase as you level.  Due to the naure of the random levels, it's very easy for a trap to be placed in a one tile hallway forcing you to walk over it.  This can possibly lead to unbeatable levels as a teleport trap is unavoidable but I have yet to encounter an impossible dungeon.For an early access beta, I'm very impressed.  Delver isn't very feature deep right now but there's plenty of room for it to grow."

Combat feels more fair and the itemization is rather generous if you take the time to check each nook.  The music gets a bit repetative, but it's still well done (particularly in the escape).  Hopefully more room blocks will be added to the dungeon layouts, however.  In my limited playtime so far, I encounted the same piece of sewer layout linked to itself four times in a row.  Some further stylization of the dungeon would be nice as well, to help differentiate it from all the other blocky games that have filled the market in recent years.

Because of this, things I say about it may change as development continues.Delver is a very simple first-person dungeon crawler: you start above ground with the task of Delving down several levels to retrieve an orb and return it to the surface. This is the gist of the story, and all you really need.Along the way you'll collect loot, level up and customize your character, and fight hoards of orcs, spiders, bandits, and skeletons.The game is great fun and simple enough to be picked up by anyone. Although initially challenging, I found that the game is exceptionally forgiving if you pump a lot of points into HP. The leveling system provides some flexibility to create what character you want to play, although this really only boils down to what weapons you will use the most.The game is relatively short at this time, and I managed a successful run through very quickly. Even though character deaths mean starting over, I was able to finish the current game in about 4 hours. Levels are supposedly procedurally generated, but I noticed very similar set pieces several times on consecutive play throughs.Nevertheless, I still recommend the game.

Yet, it's a roguelike that is very easy to learn. It perhaps sacrifices some management depth to instead put more bang into the actual action parts, with interesting charge attacks that require you to time your movement to land your blows. Then there are some bugs, some rare instant unexplainable deaths, alt-tab fullscreen issues. After a certain point, enemies start appearing everywhere and even in front of you, in a way that feels... a bit cheap. But - it's not finished.It's rather short, and I like that. Hopefully with time, the shortness of it will be compensated with variety each playthrough. I've only played it 3 times, beaten it once (failed to beat it on my second playthrough due to instant unexplainable death), and all the times felt... very similar, but not identical. Not much reason for me to play it again at this point once I've beaten it right now.Delicious graphics. I've always loved low res pixel art because it gets my brain working to fill in the gaps and to create detail where there is none and makes at least me actually immerse myself far more than in ""HD"" games.Anyway - it's fun as it is, and I'm looking forward to future updates."

And there is only one negative potion effect out of six or so, a weak poison that is easily counteracted by eating any piece of food.Delver has only 7 dungeon floors to its name, which are procedurally generated, true, save for the last, which is actually a fixed map.  Delver also lacks shopkeepers on floors, instead, there are only two NPCs, and they are on the surface above the dungeon.  So your character ends up carrying a bunch of gold with no way to spend it except by returning to the start or dying.When dying in Delver, you lose everything except your gold.  This gives you a chance to buy an item when you start a new game to give you an edge, but the high prices ensure that you cannot buy a good item on every run.The enemies in the first levels of Delver are relative pushovers (as well as possessing primitive AI that can only charge at the player in a straight line, think Minecraft Beta hostile mobs).  Most enemies in the game supposedly have no more than 4 HP, but player attacks seem to deal a lot less damage than they should according to weapon descriptions.  Charging attacks makes them hit every time, which makes fast charging weapons like daggers and shortswords much more effective than larger weapons like hammers or swords.The enemies get more advanced as you proceed, starting with bandits and slimes and advancing to spiders and floating squid things, orcs and worms, and eventually skeletons and floating skulls.  Zombies and worms can cause the poison effect, which damages health.  Though the enemies are nice so far, there are issues with surround sound in this game.  Bandits commonly yell threats as they see you, but the sound seems to come out of the opposite speaker of their direction, e.g. I hear ""You're dead!"" out of my rear right speaker, when the bandit is actually approaching from my left.  Given how much I've come to rely on surround sound in this type of game, this can be frustrating.**** the mages on the first two levels.  I have died to those guys way too many times.  Enemies cannot use bows, only magic and melee.  Melee enemies are easy to deal with, but magic can get annoying.  More annoying is the death screen, which often prevents you from knowing what exactly killed you.  This means you don't necessarily know what you did wrong to get you killed.The level up system has six stats.  Each time you level up, the game randomly chooses three for you to pick from to increase.  Health, attack, defense, speed, agility (attack speed), and magic (increases wand charges and wand damage).  I find that health is always a priority.  I try to get my health to 16, then start putting points into speed and agility.  Attack, defense, and magic are usually made obsolete due to finding better equipment.  Note that to my knowledge, the other stats also increase by a small amount on level up, but the one you pick goes up by much more than the others.Though this game is simple, it is not necessarily easy every run.  I can see this game getting much better once all the glitches with getting stuck in terrain are fixed.  I find that this game is actually quite fun if you are into dungeon crawling and exploration, and the surplus of loot is due to the ending.  At the end, you need to escape the dungeon with the treasure while being pursued by endless skeletons and skeleton mages, currently the hardest respawning enemies in the game, in addition to the extremely fast and mobile floating skulls.  The many supplies you find on your way down are basically preparation for this difficult rush section.  Upgrading speed comes in extreme handy for this action packed portion of the game.  The game has limited enemies and environments, but it is in beta and the soundtrack is solid as-is, and the enemies have enough diversity to vary with the current levels.Most of the enemies with AI that only charges straight at you are gone after the first two levels.Features I would like to see added:Noclip or some other system to deal with getting stuck in terrain without having to delete your saveBetter bandit AISpiders should deal poison instead of worms (It's gaming tradition!)Many more floorsMore level varietyMore enemiesEnemies that use bowsMore gold, shopkeepers and NPCs on floorsArmor with secondary effectsSomething that fits in the glove slot, which is currently unusedMore bosses and maybe even minibossesMore types of trapsMore hidden doors and passagesEaster eggsLocal or online co-op could be really awesome if done right (of course, the difficulty level would have to drastically increase as well)I won't put PvP arena on here because it wouldn't add to the game IMO.  Delver is a PvE type game."

Given its price, this is a really smart, visually charming, pick-up-'n'-play crawler that manages to have entertaining combat, somewhat varied enemies and plenty of loot to work through. The dungeon levels are randomised, and each play has 7 levels, the last of which contains the Orb you're after. Grinding through each level to the end is great, and battling back up with the orb is even more challenging. There's a very small upgrade element, but by vast majority this is just one of those wee games you have that you jump into occasionally for a quick run around. No strings, no commitment, just a quick half hour of fun whenever you need it. Highly recommended."

76561198042541368,Recommended,249630,12102255,"Posted: 14 September, 2014",all,Probia,"Great game so far. This isn't as much a review as it is my thoughts on what the developers should change, as this game is still in development and has frequent updates (which is awesome. frequent updates are awesome.)I love the art, although it's a little low res for me. Doom, the game this game's 2D-sprite-in-a-3D-world style is based off of, has higher resolution sprites and textures than this. I understand it's going the retro pixel art route, but it's honestly just kind of lazy to have characters this low resolution. Also, the blood is a little rediculous to me. Everything about this game screams ""E for Everyone"" then you go ahead and have these really stupid looking blood puddle decals that are left wherever you kill an enemy. I'm not saying this game isn't fit for kids, but it just looks odd and out of place. Either go a mature route and make the characters and art more realistic or take the blood out.The combat is kind of wonky. You hold down Left Click to charge up your attack, and the longer you hold it down the more damage it does. So you can either stab an enemy a bunch of times or give them a couple big, strong slashes. I understand what they're trying to go for, they're trying to make the combat more intuitive, but it doesn't work, mainly because you slow down when you charge your attack. So If you're trying to charge your attack you end up walking painfully slow towards your opponent, and I can understand it's for balancing purposes, but it honestly is just annoying and slows down combat.And probably the most annoying part about the game so far to me is hit detection. Since the characters are 2D sprites instead of 3D models, it can be really hard to tell if you're close enough to them to attack, and often times sword fights just turn into me slashing into the air not close enough to hit them, then moving closer to hit them and getting hit. It's especially annoying with enemies that don't actually attack you, they just touch you and you get hurt, because you're trying to get close enough to hit them but instead of hitting them you get too close and get hurt.I don't really like the music much, but I'm sure a lot of other people like it so I won't tell you to change it or anything, so I just turn the music off. But when you do that, you pretty much hear the torch noise on infinite repeat. It's understandable, because the game takes place in a dungeon lit by torches, but it's so, so incredibly annoying. Either turn the torch noise down, add different ambient noises, or make better music. Any one of those options would be awesome. Besides that, though, the sound effects are awesome.Although it has a couple minor problems, it's still a really fun game, and I recommend it. The magic in this game is really awesome, the feeling you get casting spells in this game is really unique, and the AI isn't bad. The level design is solid, but this game could definitely use some more rooms, I run into the same rooms fairly often. Bottom line is, it's a fun game that has potential to be a great rouge-like."

When you die, you have to start the game over again. Combat is interesting, but, at some times, extremely repetitive. The potions give random effects determined at the starting generation of a new game. Enemies are cool and have slightly varied ways of combat. You can level up and use points to upgrade certain skills, and weapons vary a fair amount.Should I buy it?Yes. It's a great game, and new content is confirmed to come, but the game get's boring after five or so hours of total gameplay. You can easily mod the game with new weapons, armor, dungeon rooms, enemies, meshes, items - pretty much everything! The community is very small, and I hope it grows more soon.RatingI'll give Delver an 8/10.It's great for short, 45 minute bursts of gameplay, but any longer can often get boring.

Get the orb and do your best to escape alive, because everything comes back at you threefold once you pick up the darn thing. The first-person perspective, coupled with a few small corridors and narrow walkways, really give you a mild sense of fear and excitement--you never know what's going to jump out from behind the wall (hopefully not a magic-user).The game is pretty short. For some players, you could run through the whole thing and escape alive in only about 3 attempts. But don't let that deter you, as it is a lot of fun regardless. That being said, I would strongly suggest picking this game up when it's on sale, as there is a lot to be desired. Still, it IS Early Access...Also, sometimes I feel like I'm being cheated. I went down there with around 80 arrows, never found a bow, found the orb instead, tried to escape, made it back up to the first floor and FINALLY found a single bow to use the arrows with.

It would be nice if the game paused while it was active and it's hard to get in and out of quickly.  I haven't found a way of identifying potions besides trial and error, and with limited health restoration, this can be deadly.

,Recommended,249630,8314631,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,King Louis XIV up in this bitch,"Delver really brings me back to Daggerfall, it's a fun little randomly-generated dungeon crawler. Enviroments stay fresh, no two playthroughs are alike. Each dungeon level brings new elements and enemies, from easier mages and warriors at the beginning to tough undead enemies at the lower levels. Enemy AI is surprisingly smart for game like this, damage an enemy and it will retreat, prepare to swing and the enemy will move to dodge, etc. It's a nice contrast to a game like Minecraft where enemies are programmed to just walk into you until you die. At the ruins level, the difficulty curve spikes, so some tactical thinking is required. You can't just run and gun, and I found myself taking advantage of things like corners and different enemy positions. Delver is a roguelike, so it features perma-death. You can't make your decisions lightly, and that's a good thing.The game has only been out for a few months and it is still in beta so there is still room for improvement. You're essentially restricted to playing a battlemage; the drop rates for things like weapons, wands and scrolls are completely random so you'll need to use a mix of everything to succeed. I think an item that allows the player to recharge an empty wand would help with that. I wish there was a bit more variation in the enemies, it's currently limited to about four or five types per-dungeon-type and some of them (like bats) can start to become annoying after a while. Potions very useful but their stats are generated randomly with every new playthrough, so you need to determine their stats through trial-and-error. If you don't have the food or health/restore potions to afford you the ability to test new potions out, you ignore them, and they start to build up in your inventory. I love the randomly-generated aspect of this game but if they were color-coded (red for health, blue for magic, etc.) and still used randomly generated stats it would make using potions more convenient.Those are just minor things though, Delver is still a great indie title with a lot of potential and I'd highly reccomend it, especially if you're a fan of the early Elder Scrolls titles."

Well the game's on it's 7th update and some interesting changes came around!The level design is much more inspired and varied : for example the cave levels have all sorts of crooked angles and secret paths hidden under foliage.  Very interesting.  There is now vendors within the dungeon to whom you can finally trade your precious gold with.  Other than that I haven't noticed that many changes and it's still a pretty straightforward dungeon crawler. The items you find still have  pretty straightforward uses .The game still looks pretty sweet.  It plays fast too. I haven't played all the way to the end yet  (nearly there if it's as long as the original version I played) but I guess now it feels more like a complete game.

The textures had been changed from 8 to 16 bits, and are really well designed. I'm also loving the tons of new enemies and weapons, as well as the possobility of shops in the overworld now. Admittedly the game is still pretty hard the further you go, so I have yet to have enough gold to test these shops, but it doesn't take anything away from the gameplay. On the note of difficulty, I'm also not sure of how many more dungeons they've added (There was only one in alpha, but that's definetly changed). There are a few issues here and there, (Throwing a fire wand into the water broke the sounds for me) but this game is still in early acess, so that's kinda to be expected.

They're 3d 16 bit, nothing fancy, but they work. It definitely adds to the retro feel.The gameplay is the same first person dungeon exploration that harkens back to Ultima Underworld. It's balanced and challenging. There is a learning curve but you will find yourself delving deeper on each try and more importantly, wanting to try again after each death.This is one of the few perma-death games that get it right. It isn't frustrating but also is not easy.  Don't get me wrong, one moment of stupid can cause a restart but the build to your character is balanced with the difficulty in such a way as to make you avoid mistakes and almost always understand exactly why you died when/where you did.

Low on health i try to run out the dungeon in hopes of getting healed, little did I know the shop keeper locked me in...Day 2I head to the next dungeon slowly gathering armor and weapons. I get a broadsword and a few magical sticks lucky me. Then a hobo hops on me several times before i stab him with my new butter sword. I then loot the hobo's bum and then I am attacked by my psychotic ex-batgirl. I then enter the next dungeon.Day 3I am testing out potions because some idiot dropped a bunch of edible food on the floor.

,Recommended,249630,11783127,"Posted: 19 August, 2014",all,Boibi,"This is unique in genre. It's an FPS roguelike. Others exist, like Paranautical Activity, but I would call that more of an FPS of Binding of Issac, while Delver is more of an FPS version of Nethack. I love Nethack, and have consequently played far too much of it. This solid FPS roguelike will actually fill that same itch in a fresh new way.The graphics may be offputting, being that they belong more in the Doom era of gaming than they do today, but it is definitely excuted well. And I also do believe that it fits the style of roguelike very well, while allowing the devs to focus on other core gameplay features. And that's where this game really shines. It's built solidly. It may not do a whole ton of things. But the things that it does, it does fantastically.I believe that if this game were to become as popular as the Dungeons of Dredmor, it could bring in a whole new legion of roguelike fans, as DoD did before it. If procedural generation and first person cameras are what you like, give this a try."

However, I know it is still only in early access but I think there needs to be a few things added, such as a slightly larger array of weapons, Toning down the OP-ness of Enemy Magic attacks (Seriously, it will kill you almost instantly with about three hits, when melee attacks to you would usually take only about 10 hits or more) A little bit more variety of elevators and/or secrets such as Buttons to uncover a secret passage, keys to open doors, Maybe add in chests for items, SUPER (That's right, different from the normal!) Secrets, a slightly more diverse Enemy Encounters, Like, more enemies, then again, there is a good selection of enemies already but eh. I don't think maybe adding in the ability to Jump in the game would be a good idea, leave that out, it's a dungeon crawler, no one can jump while crawling. (lol)What this game is strongest in however is the difficulty, already mentioned how OP enemy magic attacks are, and that needs to be toned down ever so slightly. The sense of exploration is there and is great, the Music (Or ambient noises I guess) REALLY Immerse the player into the game, seriously, sometimes I even get shivers being creeped out, it gives you a sense of danger and fear, Afraid to turn a corner, there have been times I have been jump scared in this game because of the noises almost sounding like they bounce off the walls of the rooms. The inventory system is pretty good, you open the Inventory and the game does not pause, I like that, it gives the player a sense of panic, ESPECIALLY When you are trying to get out a potion of healing (You hope as the potions are randomized each time you play) which means you setting up your inventory bar is CRUCIAL in this game. A thing I would like to see but I kind of have gotten used to, is the ability to use the Mouse Wheel, as haing to use the 1-6 keys on my keyboard have more than once caused me to use a potion when I wanted to use my magic wand.This game is FREAKING AWESOME, if you were ever in the times of floppy disks, and played those old dungeon crawlers, and love rouge-likes, and having to fear for your life because there is perma-death in the game, this game is your new best friend!I have a couple of videos so far on the game and making a Let's Play on the game!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5-wPdHgBWkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COnzuENBzds"

THE GAME IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.--Now, I shall get all of the potential negatives out of the way first. Yes, the game is light on content. With only a few enemy types and one dungeon, skilled players may find themselves quickly consuming all the game has to offer. That, and some occasional bugs that very rarely appear but can be annoying sometimes.With that all said, this game is brilliant value for money. £5.59 for a game as addictive as this is a steal, and in my opinion the dev could get away with charging a little more. The pixel art aesthetic is pulled off expertly, as so many other indie dungeon crawlers are from a top down perspective or 2D, it's refreshing to play a FPDC (first person dungeon crawler). The potion system in the game gives a tense atmosphere when you are at low health, having you gamble with fate as you could consume a health potion, or get a poison debuff alongside many other potion effects. Combat is very simple, but this works in the games favour as it makes all combat encounters very quick, which is essential as it makes runs shorter going hand in hand with the permadeath mechanic.All in all, for the stage it's at now and the price tag it has, this is a great game, and with more content on the way, I highly recommend you buy it now."

,Recommended,249630,14122822,"Posted: 23 January, 2015",all,DranKof,"I haven't been scared by a game so effectively for a while.Let's see, I'm gonna talk about the levels, the monsters, the gameplay, and character growth.LEVELS:The levels are premade rooms randomly sewn together as is common practice. The design of the rooms is very good, though the game needs more variety, still. The only outside area is the starting point, unfortunately. Going underground, there are the dungeons. Then there are cavey caves. Then there are sewers. Then there is lava...you'll have to play for more details. There are bottomless pits, pulleys and levers, keys and locked doors, doors that you have to bash down, secret doors, and trap-plate traps (teleporter traps are kinda annoying).MONSTERS:The monsters seem to fall into a few categories, which are perfect for the gameplay setup. There are fast dodging monsters (bats, flying skulls), typical meaty melee fighters (thugs/bandits/giant spiders), jumping melee fighters (they jump at you when you get close, hard to time attacks), and magical ranged fighters. Perhaps there should be some physical ranged monsters or magical melee ones? There probably will be later. The monster difficulty balances well with player development and the combat shines.GAMEPLAY:Getting onto gameplay, most everyone else has already mentioned it, the combat is very decent and straightforward; melee weapons are more dangerous to use because you might be hit (and starting out HP is very scarce). Thankfully they don't break over time like other games. Ranged weapons are bows and arrows and wands that have limited ammo. Though missed arrows can be picked up, wands never recharge. As it is a roguelike, don't expect ammunition to be too plentiful, especially for the late game. Potions are random but scrolls are not. Potion effects take about 2-3 uses to learn what they are (which I think is dumb because the player can remember them...and after playing a few times having to re-remember just gets annoying [Note to the maker: can we have it be just one potion use == in-game player learns it?]).PLAYER DEVELOPMENT:For character development, as far as I can tell, in the late game, increasing your attack or magic seems worthless. If you are good at predicting monster movements, even if your attack is low, you can take as many hits as you want without getting hit. Near the end of the game, no matter how good you are, once you start getting swarmed by mage-skeletons and flying skulls, you're gonna get hit a lot, so my advice is put most of your points into speed, health, and defense. If you ever get swarmed well...RUN!MY MAIN THOUGHTS:1) Magic is a stat that seems mostly useless, I can't imagine relying on wands near the end game when there are a lot of monsters but probably not nearly enough dropped wands, nor inventory space to hold them. Same with arrows. This is a minor balance concern that can be directly adjusted, but what I'd really rather see is a more traditional MP and learned spell system, also wands that recharge for those who are not magically-inclined.2) I 100% wish the game wasn't just a roguelike and was more developed as an RPG. The music, graphics, and engine are so awesome, I don't want my game to end just because...I won. I want more. I would pay a full $60 to play just a Diablo clone with this engine, graphics, musical, and dungeon layout feel.3) So, I was looking at the development log and there's an awesome overhaul coming to the editor. Until it comes, the current map editor is essentially unusable and the assets needed to mod the game aren't readily available so it's not really even close to being as moddable as I'd hoped. My main reason for buying this game is cause I heard it was uber-moddable. I hope as it develops the assets are more open. Modding is what opens small games like this to the masses and makes them become legendary.4) I am in love with this game. It is very charming.Pros:- Fast, easy to learn, first-person roguelike- Good music and graphics schemes- Fluid gameplay, sensible difficultyCons:- Needs more content- Without modding, little replay value"

The game has a very good random generation mechanic. It's much less tight corridors and square rooms, and more about sweet caves, libraries, rooms with pools and waterfalls, etc. The game is not bad to look at either, as the pixel art is very well done with lots of colours implemented, with things like plantlife growing in the disused tunnels rather than them just being grey and suchI find the sound design in this game to be quite good for some reason. For example, you hear the flickering of each torch lighting the dungeon as you walk past them. It's quite immersive despite the retro style.

76561198158448429,Recommended,249630,14583381,"Posted: 21 February, 2015",all,genowhirl15,"Simple Review  here:Delver is a rogue-like dungeon crawler where the player's only goal is to get to the bottom of the dungeon (7th floor), grab the Yithidian Orb, and return to the surface with it. What's the catch? Well I'm glad you asked. As previously stated, there are 7 floors in total. The first two are the Dungeons, the next two are the Caves, the next two are the Sewers, and the final stage is the dreaded Ruins. This game can have a somewhat steep learning curve, but it is very fun because each playthrough is an entirely new experience. Here's why. The dungeons are all procedurally generated (which means you get entirely new maps every time you play), the items one may acquire vary in quality and location, and all potions change in their function. The red potion may be healing or magic resistance the first time through, but it may be poison or physical damage resistance the next time through. These qualities are what make this game a Rogue-like. This is also a First Person game and there are NO PUZZLES for those of you who hate puzzles haha.Pros:+ The graphics are very well done, stylized in a 16-bit, pixelated vibe.+ The music is very pleasing and enjoyable. It is fitting for floor's theme and atmospheric as well.+ The controls are simple and easy to learn.+ The game makes leaps and bounds with every update provided.+ It has a surprisingly addictive learning curve.+ Difficulty is good enough to where you may finally beat the game one time, but when you go back to try again you can't make it.+Enemy AI is good. The various enemies have various attack patterns and styles, even methods of movement.+ A somewhat complex weapon system in which there are several types of weapons such as the bow, wand, hammer (2-hands), and long sword just to name a few. Each weapon has its own knockback, damage, and range.+ The leveling system is unique in this game in that you get to choose from 3 randomly chosen stats out of 6 total stats: Agility, Attack, Defense, Health, Magic, and Speed.+ Can create various character builds according to the stats you want, the stats your given each level up, and the amount of armor you choose to wear.+ Armor affects speed and defense: The more defense, the less speed in general.+ Tons of replay value and plenty of good texture packs and mods to extend the game and make it more challenging. . . even adding new types of floors and enemies!+ Items do not carry over after death, but gold does.+ I greatly enjoy how you start at a base camp every time that contains two vendors who can sell you things after you collect enough gold in the dungeon. If you're lucky, you may come a cross a vendor in one of the first two floors as well.Cons:- There are still a few bugs to work out such as items randomly getting stuck in walls and making this atrocious sound that cuts out the music for the rest of your journey.- Another bug would be the bow sometimes passing right through enemies or just bouncing off. Some of the enemies may just have ridiculous hit boxes (looking at you floating eye).- Other than those two bugs, I never really came across anything that was bad or wrong.- Pick your poison here: Runs can take you anywhere from 30 minutes (if you're really good and have lots of experience) to 1 hour and 30 minutes or longer (if you're a noob).- For some players, the luck factor that comes in to play when discovering gear, the distance from the entrance of a floor to the exit of a floor, and the number of enemies that spawn, may not be entirely enjoyable as it will feel as if the odds are against you a bit too strongly at times.Overall, this game is a whole lot of fun and well worth every penny spent. The creator updates relatively often and they are usually massive updates when he does. He keeps everyone informed of his goals with the game and where it is headed. It's a very good challenge and you can quit and pick it back up at any time. I personally love playing it casually while listening to some of my favorite music. It's a very relaxing, but still energetic experience."

Of course the game would get very easy over time as you get stacked up, but if it was never ending (Or super long) with much harder dungeons and monsters and more epic gear to collect it would be a great way to get you ready for those levels.As it stands now though- I paid 4 bucks- (On sale) and I feel satisfied with what I paid and played.

Delver is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with RPG elements. The art style is personalized and enjoyable to just sit there and look at for a while. But lets get to the nitty gritty. Delver still is very much still in early access. A successful run will take a little more than an hour and its replay ability is good but not that great once you beat the game. The combat is enjoyable but mabeye a bit simplistic and becomes much easier once you learn the movement system. My one big complaint is the ending when you fight the Lich. He only took 4 shots from my 11-18 damadge bow and just nuked you when you were near him tons of damadge. He felt more like a place holder than a real boss. Also when you have to climb back up to the surface it felt like filler and you could just run around the enemys till you got to the top for the most part. In the end Delver is a bit of an investment and at its current state a few hour's of fun.( Have not checked out any mods but apparently the community is great and that would add some time to your hour's)  It's your choice if you want to Invest in this but if your not sure I would wait and follow its development untill it came to a state that you liked, but if the idea really hits home with you pick it up and join the Delver community."

I had low expectations, but Delver has turned out to be one of the best roguelike dungeon crawlers I've played in quite a while. It's simple, and the graphics harken back to Daggerfall days, but it shines where it counts:- Dungeons are randomly generated (with some exceptions) and feel WORTH exploring. Maps are loaded with crevasses, bridges, hidden rooms, lava, underground lakes, traps, and more. Many maps have a 3D element to them, with bridges or loopbacks bringing you under or over an area you just walked through, or dark passages descending into gloom. If you're a completionist, there is true value in exploring every niche and nook, as the game will reward you with life-saving loot!- Loot! The loot system has more depth than you might guess. It's not Diablo, but there are some elements of the random-loot system here. The game will surprise you with finely crafted items from time to time, or weapons with elemental attacks, usually with some negative trait alongside (Broken 1-3 dmg dagger, with +3 ice damage). You have just enough space in your inventory that by dungeon level 5-6, you might have a full load (and no junk). This means careful inventory management.- Permadeth! You only die once, however you keep some of your money after death. This is useful in shops.Some other things to like about Delver:- Runs ridiculous framerates on my Macbook Pro and never even turns on the fan! My poor laptop isn't much of a gaming rig, but Delver apparently doesn't need one. It's easily the fastest and most responsive FPS-view game I own.- Loads and quits in seconds. You can boot the game and be playing in less than 10 seconds. To quit: ESC, Save, ESC drops you straight to desktop in about 3 seconds!Conclusion: Delver is an excellent choice for people who like RPG's, roguelikes, and exploration. It's lighthearted, but not dumbed-down or easy."

They just keep improving it and that alone is enough for me to recommend this game. The random level generation is some of the best I've seen in the genre thus far. I enjoy the art style and music as well. Its easy to get into but hard to master it. I still haven't made a single escape after 25 hours logged.

There's plenty to explore, collect, loot, kill, and just look at. Given that this game is in Beta I believe, I'm expecting much more in the future. The pixelated art style is charming and adds a certain quality that makes it kind of light hearted and not too serious. That's also a good way to describe the game as well, since this game is pretty easy as far as Roguelikes go. The combat isn't anything special, but it's balanced and deep enough to keep it interesting while playing. I never found it to be tedious, and it was fun timing and landing charged attacks. The menus are a bit confusing though. Nothing really goes in depth in explaining them and I'm still not sure if I've got it all figured out. The default button for your inventory is ""I"" which is a bit out of the way and inconvenient considering that the main form of movement is WSAD. If there's more movement options or a way to change the controls, I am unaware of those at this time. Another problem I had with the menus was using items. There's no indication of what button does what, nor is there any explanation as to what anything does. I had a potion in my hot bar so I could drink it. Instead, I threw it on the ground, and it exploded. It took me a minute to realize that to use some items, you had to be in your inventory, which can be a hindrance in tense moments of battle where you need something from your inventory and quickly. There's definitely room for improvements to menu functionality and more, even if small and brief, tutorials. A note saying ""Drink potions from your inventory and put them on your belt to throw them!"" would be just fine. Other than those, this game is pretty solid and simple, and has room to expand upon in the future. If you're looking for your next short addiction (or maybe even a long one) this is a good game to look into."

Having to budget health for gauranteed damage from traps in a roguelike is like trying to pay your mortgage payment with dryer lint. You just don't have the ability to do that. However, I will be willing to play the game some more if I discover that was a very uncommon situation; IE, up until the point I encounter that problem again. If you enjoy roguelikes and you really liked the Might & Magic 1st person adventure games, you'll enjoy Delver.Update (Spoiler Warning): It is possible to deal with most traps without stepping on them even if they are between you and the path you need to go down, but there are still areas and configurations where they will always hit you, even if you try to disable them. Still holding my thumb up but sequels will need some tweaking."
,Recommended,249630,31091630,Posted: 11 April,all,Λlceus,"Love the art style. I love this game so far but I think it feels a bit too plain and easy (not your normal rogue like). I know it's early access but there needs a variety of different enemies or different stats of enemies (say slimes... there should be fire, lava, water, etc slimes) I find myself running around and easily killing enemies. I should be afraid of the unknown not confident.And the traps are soooo soooo soooo obvious and visible. You can avoid it easily unless it's down a 1 block path. I think removing the huge plate and making it almost the same as the floor but different colour will make me not want to run around and be careful were I go.You can play all styles heavy warrior, archer, mage (no cast spells only wands I think. I haven't gotten far yet).The only enemies I encountered so far and I really hate that makes this game a bit challenging are those floating eyes of eyes that shoot burning balls. So op. I only find like 1-2 enemies each room. And that I can easily kill (again I haven't reached that far. I only reached ruins). If enemies were more difficult and more in numbers (could be a mod) I would love this game more.One last thing. All weapons and armors rings necklaces (foods?) Are all identified. Except for potions... I like the sense of having to be careful with everything you find and needing a scroll of identification to make sure the items are safe. (Cursed unfurled blessed etc). It made the game more challenging and a sense of wanting to beat the game. (I'm talking about nethack the origin of rogue likes ).So far I would recommend the game. I'm looking forward to the final product and hope they change it to the way I think it should be (or mods)."

,Recommended,249630,6426290,"Posted: 15 September, 2013",all,Gwenyvier,"Delver is a fun little first person rogue-like where you play as a nameless hero that goes through a (currently) small dungeon to find some important item. It is in early access currently so quite a bit is going to be added to it and its obviously still rather rough around the edges. It is 7 floors long only at the moment (again, EARLY ACCESS), the starting room of the first floor and the entire 7th floor are static. This may change in the future. Another thing worth mentioning is that the potions are bugged currently. No matter the color they always have random effects. This is almost guaranteed to be fixed in a future update as finding out what potions do is such an inherent part of the genre it would be a huge mark against the game otherwise.The game-play itself is quite fun, a decent amount of monster variety at the stage it's at, traps you can mess with to find out what they do, and very nice atmosphere. Good randomization of weapons, although the current options are rather limiting.As I stated a couple times already it is early access. In the future there will be more mobs, items, a potion fix (hopefully), and other things. The game will also be open so it can be modded and have texture packs added... there might even be some already, I did not check. And, for those that like playing dungeon master, a level editor so you can build your own fiendish dungeons to kill your friends in."

So if you read any more negative reviews that were made before or around the time this review was made, if they mention anything about the developers not updating, this is why.)Delver is a simple roguelike dungeon crawler that is, I believe, heavily influenced by games like DOOM and Zelda.The objective of the game is to enter a procedurally generated dungeon (Different every time) that consists of several floors with different themes, get the treasure, and return to the surface safely.I don't want to spoil to much, because Delver, I think, is supposed to give you a feeling of wonder, suspense, and the unknown. And, despite being very simple, I feel it somehow does this very well, even after playing the game multiple times. Which I think is why I love it so much. The game is somewhat difficult, maybe even unfair at times, but hey, why would the enemy make it fair in the first place?And also, that is part of the mystery, sometimes, dungeons are full of loot and as you make your way down, you will eventually become nearly invincible, other times, you really have to just make do what you have, and sometimes the traps and the general layout of the dungeon is a real pain in the butt. so, basically, the games difficulty is different EVERY TIME. Which, personally, I think is brilliant. But of course, I highly doubt anyone will be having any competitions with this for $10,000 anytime soon. Which is OK.I cannot express the feeling of winning this, especially for the first time. It makes my day even more than cookies do.Which is saying a lot. I challenge you to beat Delver, if you dare.
