,Recommended,249680,7617539,"Posted: 9 November, 2013",all,///cl4ym4n.de >:3,"Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a fast-paced third person hack'n'slash game by Slovenian developer ZootFly which didn't catch a lot of attention among PC gamers at its release. Making use of pretty much all of the popular clichés, the game is filled with mindless over-the-top action, tons of explosions and hilarious puns without ever taking itself seriously at any point.The story proves this instantly: Your girlfriend translates ancient scripts for a rich company mogul somewhere in Central America. You visit her and she explains to you how her boss is up to no good because he wants to perform a ritual that would make him a powerful god and ruler of the world. So you try to take here with you back home, which her boss obviously doesn't like, so he gets you killed with an ancient scythe, not knowing that it is imbued with power that resurrects you and summons the Mask of Death, your new companion on your path to rescue your girlfriend and stop the bad boss.The game is based on ZootFly's own proprietary, multi-platform engine called ZEN, which doesn't really provide any PC graphics options other than resolution, fullscreen and brightness. That's a shame because the game could've definitely used some AA, which would make the colorful and detailed enviroments look even better than they already do.While the level design as such is pretty linear, which tends to get boring after a while in a lot of games, ZootFly actually managed to add quite a lot of variety to it. Throughout the game you will encounter combat arenas, puzzles, deadly death traps, quick-reaction minigames, turret sequences and even some top-down shoot-em-up action. This sounds like a weird mix of gameplay elements but is incorporated extremely well into the game, so you never have the feeling that it is out of place.Combat and controls are exactly like what you would expect from a game like this. Throughout the story, you get access to 4 different and upgradable weapons, each of them with a variety of combos to deliver maximum damage. Additionally, by defeating the ancient gods of fire, earth, water and wind, you unlock their devastating ground attacks, which can help you out of tricky situations or simply cause widespread carnage when facing many of the varying enemies at once.The puzzle elements in the game mostly consist of moving blocks on trigger platforms or flipping switches to open doors and while they never are overly challenging they actually provide a welcome change to the otherwise extremely fast-paced gameplay, so you can take a short break from all the action.Usually, with a low-budget title like this, the soundtrack and voice acting are two of the things where the developer tries to save money. Surprisingly enough, the soundtrack is actually pretty decent and, paired with the level design, builds up a really good atmosphere. While the dialogues are a bit cheesy at times, the voice acting itself is good and fits perfectly to the game characters, especially to Marlow and the Mask, who are constantly teasing each other verbally. That makes for some hilarious puns even in the weirdest situations. For example, while you are climbing a stone wall that is about to collapse and kill you, you are arguing with the Mask about who is whose sidekick in this game.With around 8 hours of playtime for the story, the game provides an extremely decent bang for the buck and if you want to test your skills further, you can give the Challenge mode a shot where you replay the minigames from the story to achieve better scores and times to rank up in the online leaderboards.Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is cheesy. It's mindless. It's over-the-top action. But that is exactly what makes the game so enjoyable and so much fun and it's great to see some developers going bonkers with their games without trying to be serious, dramatic or mature. If something like this is right up your alley, make sure to check the game out!Oh, did I mention that you can ride giant scorpions in the game?Because you can!FRIGGIN' GIANT SCORPIONS!"

Fortunately an old Mayan mask of death turns Marlow into a reborn sacred warrior, ready for revenge and on his way to free his abducted girlfriend. This extremely trashy start of the game turns into a very enjoyable action adventure brawler, that does not take itself too seriously and offers beautiful levels and explosive fights.'Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death' is not a revolutionary game. It does nothing specifically unique and borrows heavily from other games without ever outdoing them. It's not the most polished game and has a few questionable design decisions. But none of this matters because Marlow Briggs is unquestionably a blast to play.Pros:- deliberately trashy, it's all about the fun- great conversations between the mask and Marlow- fluid movements- good voice acting- nice, average graphics- explosive, wild fights- enjoyable boss fights- top-down shooter in-game mini-games- credits is a mini-game too- hilarious end of the story- feels like a B-movie- many automatic save points- option to save manually- ride and fight with a giant scorpion- learn, upgrade and use magic attacks- find and upgrade different weaponsNeutral:- except for the final boss fight the game is a little too simple on normal difficulty- choosing the best combo is not important on normal difficultyCons:- sometimes somewhat annoying camera perspective- the game crashed four times in my 10 hour play-through"

76561198019205444,Recommended,249680,13490239,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,sitebender,"Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a third person hack and slash, action adventure that is probably the closest thing to God of War on the PC. It is fantastic game in general, let alone the budget price. It has over the top action, which means plenty of explosions and crazy moments like Marlow hanging from a helicopter and he needs to dodge left or right. The game plays great, the graphics are amazing. The camera will zoom out for you to see beautiful vistas, foreboding caverns and giant industrial complexes. There is a scope and scale to this game. You can be so tiny in a grand complex and you feel it. The game really shines with its gameplay diversity. You won't just be hacking and slashing. There are fun turret sections, plenty of not too difficult platform traversal, climbing, swinging, running from boulders, pushing objects, sliding down areas, working turnstile levers and even playing a top down vertical scrolling shooter. These other elements bring a lot of diversity to break up the brawling.The story is simple and so bad its good. You're Marlow, visiting his girlfriend in a remote jungle, so she can quit her job working for an evil madman bent on immortality. To show her he means business, he kills you right then and there to kick off the game. Marlow gets killed with a magical artifact and the mask of Death resurrects him. So now with crazy magical powers, Marlow must save his girlfriend. The mask will guide Marlow along the way. There is a lot of humor between Marlow and the mask. Its not a comedy game, but has dabs of humor here and there. Marlow Briggs knows how implausible the situation is and doesn't always take things seriously. The mask is there to aide and taunt Marlow when he dies. To show the game's humor, the antagonist is named Heng Low. He makes some great announcements throughout the game, such as, ""all personnel, go grab a gun. There's a nice reward for killing Marlow Briggs. You can use that reward to pay for the weapon rental."" Oh and ""All employees are fired, please avoid flaming death traps and bottomless pits on your way out.""The core game play is simple. You can move, double jump, weak attack, strong attack, grapple, block, roll in any direction with the right analog stick, use magic by pressing two buttons and change weapons with the D-pad. Marlow will get four weapons throughout the game. Each weapon has a different speed, range and damage, but for the most part they are pretty much the same. When he attacks he'll swirl around, causing beautiful death. Its visually appealing. There are four spells to earn. A fiery meteor shower in a circle, earth spikes in a straight line, frost to freeze a radius of enemies and a storm. Every enemy gives you experience to upgrade your weapon and magic levels. It seems like every spell depletes all your mana. Luckily each dead enemy brings you health and mana. There is plenty of mana, health and experience around each level. You just need to hold a button to absorb it, so if an enemy is around, they can keep you from getting them. Enemies can be grappled and thrown, but more interesting, they can be converted, making them fight for you! Your block can reflect projectiles if you time it right and you have magical projectiles of your own.It is all a nice system, made even more enjoyable by a wide cast of enemies. The standard soldiers don't use guns, just machetes since this is a hack and slash. Rocket launchers that need you to reflect. Riot troops that need to have their shields knocked away with specific attack combos. Bugs that can be easily squashed. There are plenty of mini bosses that show up in the game. First they get their own fight, but then they appear later as common enemies. When most of the mini bosses get weak, you can hop on and control them. Not like the conversion, but rode. You can ride a giant scorpion and control it to kill enemies. You can ride giants the same way. The visual is better than the actual fun. I could kill the enemies a lot quicker without being on top of slow lumbering giants.Speaking of giants, then there are the game's big bosses. The bosses so big that you're as tall as a single eye. Each big boss has many parts and they're quite memorable. Its all simple pattern recognition though so its easy enough once you figure out the pattern. The only problem is that you don't do much damage. At the end there is even a quick time event or mash the grapple button.You have NO control over the camera. It is always carefully placed and follows you well enough. I only had a problem with that once or twice in the whole game. The load times are hid. I didn't notice one at all unless I came back to a save. Dying has a really quick reload time to the point its just a quote, then you respawn from the last frequent checkpoint. Its so nice to be back in the action.To keep things interesting, there are challenges in the game. Things like you're sliding down a hill and need to move left and right. The challenge is collecting all the experience orbs! Don't collect them all? You can restart or just keep playing. You can kill all the helicopters in the turret section or the town down shooter section. It adds an extra level of challenge to what would be an easy game on normal (medium) difficulty. Even though the game stays the same level of difficulty, the later areas just take longer. Bigger enemies take more damage. Puzzles take longer.Other elements in the game have players jumping between three mine carts to avoid obstacles. Floating with angels wings between platforms. Swimming through a swinging guillotine river. Climbing wall vines, killing worms. Inching with Marlow's back to the wall to avoid either falling or gears. Clinging to cliff sides. Dodging flaming wrecking balls. Turret shooting the pistons on a giant lava scooper as you ride around a cart. Getting chased by helicopters. Seeing giant scorpions get crushed by huge boulders completely unscripted. Escaping under a door by rolling just before spikes crushed the enemies in the room. Fighting enemies on a helipad as it flipped and flew through the air.  Seeing the giant facility Marlow is in was really mobile with treads.It all feels like a high budget game in a lot of ways, but lacking in a few, especially the cut scenes. There aren't many animated cut scenes, but the majority of the scenes are fly around of scenes. Its like bullet time. You'll see a still frame circling around Marlow as he's hacked through a flame throwing soldier. As the camera swings around, it will reveal a helicopter. Then Marlow leaping from the copter, only to swing around and show Marlow slashing through an insect.  I'm happy that the cut scenes are the worst part of the game, especially since they're skipable. They spent the time in the animation, character models and gameplay.The game is well worth the $5 price tag it currently has. I am shocked this game doesn't have a cult following or more popularity. Even with a 7 hour run time and not too much frills for any replay value, I think this could stand shoulder to shoulder with God of War. The diversity really kept me engaged. Nothing overstayed its welcome. 7 hours was the right time. Its best to leave players wanting more. Odd now Steam says that I only played 5 hours. Oh steam."

And, I have to admit, it's actually damn fun to play.Marlow plays like some sort of Devil May Cry or God Of War, but where these other games usually take a little break inbetween the action packed moments Marlow moves full speed ahead. There's hardly ever a dull moment in this game. You move from one crazy action packed scene to the next, with usually just a few seconds of breathing room before hacking away at the next group of enemies.This game isn't extremely long, about 5-6 hours, which is more than enough. After finishing it you're probably done with it anyway. It's fun for a first playthrough, then you'll just delete if off your PC most likely. It doesn't have any replay value. Which might actually be the reason why it's just non-stop action.The graphics look good, the voice acting is decent and the gameplay solid.Marlow Briggs is something you just have to play if you love action games.

,Recommended,249680,18392140,"Posted: 9 October, 2015",all,talgaby,"Short version: 88%Marlow Briggs is the kind of game that knows it is bad and enjoys every last second of it. The corny acting, the even cornier lines, the dumbed down hack & slash mechanics, and the hilariously stupid plot all serve one thing: to let you have a great time.Long version:Steam is full of bad games. And while Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is undoubtedly a bad game, what makes it stand out in the sea of Greenlight schlock is that it was designed to be a bad game: which suddenly elevates it into so-bad-it-is-actually-great status.Let me explain.When you play a bad game, you often get frustrated because of bad level design or game mechanics, or bad controls. Or even worse, the game is downright boring. With Marlow Briggs, you will hardly ever get bored: it is a platformer, a hack & slash, a rail shooter, and a shoot ‘em up– all packed into one explosive pack of joy. Sure, some of the platforming levels are repetitive and the camera tends to kill you more than the bosses, but there are so many minigames and shooter sections that you will never, ever get bored.The game mechanics are simple as a brick: you have a jump button, normal and a power attack, and a few spells. They form dozens of combos, but they cannot hide the fact that Marlow Briggs is played by mashing two buttons as fast as you can. Combat is strangely satisfying though with good enemy design and one of the most balanced difficulty sliders I saw in a long time.The cherry on top of this rather delicious action cake is the story. You cannot name a single 90s action movie cliché or one-liner that isn’t here in some form, and there are more explosions than in Michael Bay’s entire filmography. All completed with a voice acting hammier than a pig farm; it is hilariously terrible and you will probably find yourself unable to not laugh at it, just like how the developers intended."

The developers had a very clear idea of the game they wanted to make, and didn't waste time or money refining the less critical elements. As such, there are some minigames and sequences that feel qutie arcade-y, which is not necessarily a bad thing. After so much AAA saturation, a little goofy action is refreshing. The RPG elements are so barebones as to feel obligatory, but the combos require just enough co-ordination to feel satisfying.Marlow Briggs reminds me very much of the PS2 era of action gaming. I'm not very far into the game at all, but so far I very much enjoy it, especially for the dirt cheap price I paid for it."

Resurrected by a spirit in the blade Marlow can now wield various supernatural weapons, and can't die (obviously in terms of gameplay he can, but you are resurrected at a checkpoint...)To rescue his girlfriend, and stop some real bad end of times stuff happening, he must stab lots of things and climb up lots of platforms. Luckily he is quite handy at doing both.This is a surprisingly fun, slick game along the lines of Devil May Cry / Dante's Inferno / Wolverine: Origins / Enslaved / Conan, and, er.....are there are any others on PC? It controls well, and is responsive. It's not quite the skill based style of DMC, but a fairly hefty challenge encourages using his various weapons and requires some dexterity.For a game that isn't AAA it has some nifty setpieces, decent production values, and is amusingly stupid about a very stupid story. To compare it to God Of War (which is the most spectacular of this kind of game in my eyes) would be daft, but it would be fair to say that 'Marlow Briggs etc' makes a pretty darn good go at the genre.And its certainly better than Dante's Inferno or Wolverine Origins. I doubt many people remember them, yet I can't think of anything more recent that was this kind of gameplay. The DMC reboot is certainly more polished, but as long as skill and scoring isn't your main interest, then this game will do nicely for your bloodthirsty urges.Looking at my Steam time though - it is a smidge short, though I might have played  some of it offline."

And to be clear, the graphics are a little sloppy, the game-play is straight out of God of War, the ""plot"" is B-movie fluff, and there are no Steam trading cards for this title. On the other hand...Marlow Briggs is AMAZING! It completely embraces the cheesiness of its premise, and delivers absurdly over-the-top action on a scale unheard of in most video games. Through it all the protagonist delivers a ton of action movie one-liners and amusing meta-commentary on the number of puzzles involving spikes, swinging blades, and fire. Instead of long, boring cut-scenes, we get cool ""freeze frame"" moments, with the camera swooping and panning around the frozen tableau as Marlow Briggs defeats an army of giant bugs, or cuts a helicopter in half, or survives the explosion of a cruise-ship-sized mining vehicle. It's also nice to see a black guy as the protagonist, with no one else in the game making a big deal out of it.There is nothing new or original in this package, so don't expect it to change the definition of gaming.

X and Y weak/strong attacks strung into combos. 4 different weapons types. Standard med speed/med damage/med range(sword type), fast/short range/med damage(dagger type), fast/long range/low damage(chain type) and Slow/low range/high damage(hammer type). As well as elemental magic attacks. Though these do more or less the same thing except the ice one. Powerful AOE attack.Its got block puzzles, its got platforming, ledge grabbing, timed based swings and jumps. It also has a really weird and out of place vertically scrolling shooter that happens more than once.The banter between the main character and the mask that gives the character powers is actually funny at times and very self aware. It never really gets in the way or become annoying.It's paced pretty well, at the end it drags a little (but only a little). Maybe it over stays its welcome by a small unit of measurement. If it were maybe 4-5 hours long it'd be perfect. 6 or more if you're a completionist seems just enough to make me mention the length might be an issue.It's more inspired by God of War mechanically but the aesthetics are pretty much Uncharted with some industrial zones.

It invokes feelings of just sitting down with good friends, and riffing on some random off-brand movie that we found at a local video store. And, much like those movies, you will get a lot of the same thrills from Marlow Briggs. The game itself is so over-the-top at some points that it's just comical, and I easily found myself smiling through my entire playthrough of it. Like most good B-movies, it takes what people want, in this case a God of War style combat system, and it just pushes it over the top while being aware that it's so rediclous. The writing on some of the lines is just absolutely amazing, and the voice acting is suprisingly good, given how cheap this game is.

It is clearly a low budget game that is not a breakthrough for the game industry or the game’s genre. However, this game provides plenty of fun from the beginning. The gameplay feels varied enough as you traverse different settings in the same country and the action never lets up.Marlow Briggs is a smokejumper who goes on vacation outside the U.S. to a Spanish speaking country. I initially thought it was Mexico, but it could have been Central or South America based on the jungles and the rich history of the indigenous people. He is with his girlfriend, an archeologist who is kidnapped by an Asian madman, Heng Long, with godlike magical powers who seems bent on taking over the world. This madman kills Marlow Briggs with a mythical weapon, but he is reborn by a Mayan mask proclaiming him to be the sacred warrior who must save the sacred land. Long is backed up by an army of mercenaries of varying levels of difficulty. Marlow goes to fight to save the land for the Mayan mask and to save his girlfriend. It becomes apparent that this plot is formulaic and unoriginal but this game can get away with it because of its X factor: entertainment value.Once Marlow goes to work the plot takes a backseat and the real fun begins. Marlow begins with the same weapon used to kill him. It has short range, but it cuts good. The gameplay seems to borrow elements from the Tomb Raider series and God of War. The mercenaries may seem repetitive at times, but it does not detract from the fun that combat provides. The Mayan mask becomes Marlow’s sidekick, cracking cheesy jokes along the way. While the combat is mainly melee Marlow is introduced to magic spells that require full or near full levels of mana. There are red masks for health regeneration and blue masks for mana regeneration. The red and blue masks are generously placed in areas of intense combat. Therefore, it is easy to regenerate health and mana after the combat is over. There are also new weapons to use that slice better and have more range than the first weapon of the game. Sometimes Marlow sounds like an action hero from a cheesy action film when fighting saying things like “Aw yeah, class is in session.” His acrobatics are well animated, whether in combat or jumping from one section to another.There are many bosses that Marlow Briggs must face. I think they are quite impressive and require you to figure out their moves so that you can best fight them without taking damage in return. The boss fights seem to ensure that you put as much importance in your defensive moves as you do in your offensive moves. It becomes important to damage your toughest foes without taking so much damage in return. The battles with the ordinary mercenaries are the ones that feel a little repetitive as you advance through the game. The animations of all the mercenaries are impressive and look realistic.There are platforming aspects to this game, much like the Tomb Raider games. There are plenty of puzzles, some timed whereas others are not timed. Some puzzles require you to jump around a lot to reach the next destination. Other puzzles require you to move boxes to open doors or gain access to boxes that can lead to higher levels. The puzzles are really none too complicated to solve. There sceneries are not the best in terms of graphics, but they are respectable with enough detail to look realistic, especially for a low budget game. Eventually, Marlow will be able to glide (fly) from one platform to another since double jumps will not always be good enough. There is also a break in the melee action when Marlow is required to shoot stationary guns to shoot down choppers. There are also challenges that require you to shoot down aircraft in top-down style.The one gripe I have about this game is the fixed camera angles. The camera angles are inflexible and awkward as they do not allow for much viewing freedom. This can lead to some frustrations such as jumping and falling to your death. Eventually, I got over the problem with these camera angles. It feels like an unrefined aspect of this game, but it is not so bad that it would ruin the game. The developers at ZootFly can sure use tips from Crystal Dynamics, the developers of Tomb Raider, on how to best apply camera angles in a game that features platform jumping and puzzle solving. Also, there are times when the camera obstructs your view when fighting two very large Juggernauts of Chabtan. One comes after me while I can’t see what the other one is doing.I think Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death deserved more popularity than it got. It is a solid action game with plenty of fun gameplay that never reaches boredom. I recommend this game to anyone. At a price of $4.99 you cannot go wrong with this game.My Score: 7/10"

This is a great hack and slash in the same style as God of War, but in an action movie motif that screams 'Big Trouble in Little China' homage. Much like the 80s film, the hero (who may be the sidekick depending on opinion) is thrust into saving his girlfriend from the villain, voiced by James Hong who is once again typecast as the asian man who's trying to use a girl for a crazy ritual.There's four weapons and four magic spells you can use. All of which level up quite quickly in the somewhat basic upgrade menu. What's a game without a tacked on upgrade system, mirite? It's not bad, but it has no fancy skill trees or anything.The writing isn't the best, but it is entertaining. Especially the dialogue between Marlow and the floating Mayan mask he talks to. The voices are good in the sense that they're over the top and fit the style that the game is going for.The pacing is great. A nice mix of platforming, combat, puzzles, wall climbing, sliding, and on rail shooting. They're spread out to keep things interesing as you progress. The combat itself is also pretty good.

I clicked on Marlow Briggs just for the heck of it, expecting to see tons of negative reviews...... but they were pretty much all positive, and said the game was like God of War, but for (during Summer Sale right now) 99 cents. I bought it immediately.It's a fantastic game. It has amusing characters like Marlow and the Mexican god who guides him. There's Long, the villain, and  Marlow Brigg's assassin who teams up with him during his afterlife. The plot is average, but doesn't matter much in this type of game. You can tell production budget was somewhat low, but they still managed to get moments that are far more epic than $60 shooters. The graphics are fair and some of the views (such as of ancient temples and towns, plus the factory) are beautiful. It is like God of War in every way, and that is a good thing. You get new weapons as you go along, and you can upgrade these weapons. With new weapons comes new moves and more options during combat. You also get new mega-powers, such as summoning a hailstorm of lava or creating a blizzard that freeze enemies. Along with weapons and powers, you also get to fight new enemies with harder and harder difficulty. In addition, there are many different environments and fun mini games to play. Did I mention you can save whenever you want?This game is 99 cents during sale, and it is worth every penny. Buy Marlow Briggs and prepare to have fun."

Now, bump it up to Hardcore and you're in for a challenge, except I'm now wondering if I had figured how to get the game to switch weapons sooner (Tab key doesn't work for me, I had to use the individual number keys), if it would've been easier. There is also a serviceable amount of platforming and puzzle-solving, though nothing any seasoned player will be stuck on for very long (with maybe an exception here or there).Anyway, the game is fast-paced, action-packed, and has lots of explosions and goofball banter between the main character and his floating Mayan mask spirit helper, and just about every action game cliche that's been invented in the past decade - bullet time, QTEs, slow-mo special moves, massive combo attacks, mini-game sequences - you name it, it's probably in here. Once you're past the factory settings near the beginning and into the Mayan jungles, it becomes one feast for the eyes after another (screenshots do not do it justice).The game frequently goes on sale for around $1-$3, and if God of War clones or action games in general are your thing, I can easily recommend it for that. Even the current store price of $5 isn't a bad deal for it, but since I found it easy, I imagine that people who are more used to playing games of this genre than me might blow through it quickly, even on Hardcore.Rating: 3.5/5"

Sure it's a budget title, and it shows at times with some questionable camera positions in a couple of places, as well as enemies which show up a bit too often near the middle of the game.The jungle landscapes do look rather nice, the stop motion action sequences do a really good job of capturing the over the top action of some of the 80s action movies, without having to actually animate it. The combat is satisfying with your standard light attack, heavy attack, block and dodge rolls. Some rather good platforming segments and other action segments break up the game from being just beating up enemies.It doesn't do much wrong. It's not exceptional either, but as a budget title it's a quite enjoyable time. Just make sure you play with a gamepad."

The game's pace is frantic and non-stop from beginning to end switching you between combat sequences, platforming, rail shooting, sliding sequences and even SHUMP sections with the only lull being the games three puzzles.The game looks surprisingly good for its $15 price tag with some notable backdrops looking really impressive, combat animations that flow nicely and a solid framerate throughout its entirety. However animations in the few cutscenes that are actually fully animated look really janky and awkward which is probably why they opted to do panning/ stop motion type sequences for most of their cutscenes which are unique and work quite well.Where the game really shines though is its dialogue and sense of humor which is as plentiful and quickly paced as everything else in this game.If you enjoy character action games or humorous over the top action stories you will definitely want to check this out."

But Marlow Briggs lacks both charm and quality to make it appealing. Few would argue that the pricing is reasonable. However, the game suffers from too many issues to make it a recommendable game. The game consists of platforming sections and ""hack n slash"" combat. The problem is not the variety in combos, weapons, enemies and level design. I'd go as far as saying the developers have done a decent job (for a low-budget game anyway) in those departments. The problem is simple: PLATFORMING SECTIONS. This is a game where you don't have control over the camera so it's EXTREMELY linear - as in, you can't deviate. One would think that there is little to go wrong but you'd be wrong. You will die hundreds of times not because of poor timing or misjudgement, but because the game is simply glitchy. Inputs are not handled with any care whatsoever - the game doesn't feel consistent or smooth to play at all. Everything has a delay, and sections involving grappling or swinging are very buggy - often you can't jump off the rope, for example. Although the game is light-hearted and makes jokes about its own design, there's nothing original whatsoever. It's not classy, intelligent or well-thought out by any means. The story and characters are generic, and the level of comedy is not enough to make you laugh out loud. The problem becomes apparent when you realise that the game is TRYING to be ""epic"" with all its fancy locations and scenery, yet the texture quality is bad with lots of pop-in. Whilst I highly value big-budget AAA titles, I also have an appreciation for the underdogs and smaller games which sacrifice production value for a single aspect - like comedic writing/characters or focus on one specific gameplay mechanic. Unfortunately, Marlow Briggs does not impress in any department. If you are bored and have nothing better to do and are desperate for a cheap giggle, Marlow Briggs can provide that. Just don't expect it to be anything memorable."

The game play elements are lots of fun, like shooting down helicopters with Artillery guns and destroying large machine with artillery mounted guns, etc.. It has some RPG elements for enhancing skills, plus there are some on screen driven scenes that require quick key punching to complete a special kill or end a scene.I did have some issues with resolution but they seem to pan out. I can't run the game at 2560x1080 without getting some bleed over and stretch effect, but when running the game at a true 1920x1080 on my ultrwaide monitor it looks great, fitsm y screen with no stretch and no black bars.Overall its been great fun and I am kind of depressed that there was never a second one made...Worth the full price asking and definitely a must have at a $1."

Lip synching isn't the best, bust graphics are bright and fun, matching the over the top atmosphere. Explosions about, and everything just works. Some environments are repetitive, and there could be more enemy variety, but what does exist really does feel like a nice jungle/industrial vide well. Overall pretty if not exceptional graphics. One note, probably due to budget, not all cutscenees are fully rendered, but instead play out in comic book style action frames. They look good and convey the action well, but would have been so much more epic in real time.+/- Sound and voice work is mostly competent, if pretty flat. No stadouts here at all. Better maybe than what you'd expect for a $5 game, but nothing more. Explosions and combat sounds are good though. Again, nothing exceptional but fit the game well. Only thing would have made it better is if either Marlow, or the villian, Mr. Long, were better done to fully match the cheesy 80's vibe.+/- Story is pure 80's cheese and I mean that in the best way possible. Everything is exploding, you are kicking♥♥♥♥♥and throwing puns, your mask sidekick mocks you when you die, and the bad guy absurdly sets up why everything is basically a deathtrap. This isn't a good story. It's clinche and dumb as hell. But it's fun.+/- Combat, being the core of the game, is mostly well done. Learning to dodge and block, switching up between your varied attacks, and using combo's is the name of the game. We aren't talking Bayonetta or DMC level of complexity, but it works well. Movements are sometimes a bit sluggesh however, most noticably during some ""challeges"" where even on missed jump means instant death. Despite those ""Challenge"" sections, I found the game to be pretty responsive.If you are looking for big, brash, stupid, 80's action movie style gameplay that is just fun. Look no further.

Like, ""watch out for copyright lawsuits"" heavily) by God of War 2, a game already known by all men with booming voices, beards, and indescribable road rage, this is the tale of Marlow Briggs.  See, Marlow isn't just your regular old barrel-chested he-man.  He fights fires.  Not to be confused with spraying water on burning buildings, no.  Before you have ever even picked up the controller, Marlow Briggs has had a history of going mano-e-mano with towering pillars of flame.  Fists only.  No items.  Final Destination.  By the time your dainty, effeminate hands have laid themselves down on the controller (play it with a controller, it's a console type of action game), he has had sexual intercourse with more women than you have ever seen, including your mother and all of your sisters over the age of 18, though the underage ones still jill off to him.  Over the course of the next few hours, you will direct his wrath at a menagerie of mercenaries and Aztec horrors all over a Central American jungle.  Even though I was already an adult male, this game put me through a second, much stronger puberty.  My testicles dangle like anvils with a sweater on them, my booming voice shatters windows and sends girly men screaming to the ground, and my muscles got so big that even wearing a muscle shirt still costs the GDP of a small African country.  I have to wear a shirt or else risk being drowned in a tide of slippery sloots.

Although a budget title, graphically it has a lot of polish with big set pieces, a lot of explosions and decent enough effects. The plot is silly and the game knows it. As Marlow Briggs, you are a huge black dude who gets imbued by superpowers after being stabbed by a mystic, ancient weapon. You are then followed around by a floating tribal mask while you 'save the princess' and the fate of the world. While beating people up is the primary mode of play, you will also shoot down helicopters (multiple times), fly planes (1942-style), platform and puzzle solve. It's mindless fun.It's no masterpiece, though. Textures are pretty low resolution, and I encountered at least one showstopping bug during my playthrough. There are some annoyances, like how some ledges you can't fall off of (even though there's nothing blocking you from the edge) and others you can easily walk to your death. There are a few too many 'minecart' sequences (the kind where you are on-rails and have to dodge obstacles) - one of these is on an actual minecart. Most of these are just annoying instead of fun. The game is farily easy, with the exception of the final boss, which took me a few tries to beat. In fact, the hardest part of the game is the end credits (I'll let you figure out what I mean on your own).Anyway, for the price (dirt cheap on steam sale), it's easy to recommend."

It's a stupid hack-and-slash with no depth that succeeds because it keeps the pace up and constantly changes what you're doing. It has a dumb-as-rocks story that involves Marlow Briggs, a Regular Guy (TM) getting killed by an Evil Genius (TM) and then being resurrected to take on said Evil Genius by Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot.From there it's 6-8 hours of slashing and platforming and rail shooting. You don't do any one thing for too long so it doesn't get boring.The only issue I have with the game is some of the late game boss fights, which fall into the trap of going like this: dodge to avoid boss's slow attack, dodge in and hit boss once or twice, dodge back out, repeat. This would be fine except that many of the bosses have really large health pools, so, while it's not hard to beat them because you can easily avoid their attacks, the battles do test your patience. This is just bad game design. If I've figured out the trick to beating the boss, let me beat the boss already! Don't make me do the trick 40 times, I already understand it!Other than that it's good if you want something with that dumb 80s action movie feel.Performance note: this game has a couple of annoying, but not game-breaking, technical problems.First, my audio drivers crashed every single time I quit the game, resulting in that loud buzzing noise that you get when your drivers crash. I had to restart the computer to get the noise to stop. Not a huge deal since I beat this in 3 sittings, but it is annoying. I have a dedicated Asus Xonar soundcard and I haven't noticed anyone else complaining about this problem, so it might just be my setup. YMMV.Second, this game respects the Windows display scaling when it shouldn't. What I mean is, I have my computer hooked up to a 43"" TV and I sit about 7 feet away, so I have to set text and apps to 150% size in Windows display settings to make things readable. When I run Marlow Briggs with display scaling set to 150%, the game's menus and HUD increase as well and run off the side of the screen. So I had to toggle my Windows display scaling every time I booted the game up. I haven't noticed any other games that do this, so it makes me think that 505 Games just doesn't know what they're doing."

After that, Marlow wants revenge on the one who killed him and to take his girlfriend back from the same guy. Nothing original at all but it does what it's supposed to.Great game all the way through.

You also get a just-shy of annoying Aztec mask spirit-guide thing and some fun dialogue here and there, though don't expect anything mind-blowing. The stop-motion fly-by changeovers is actually a nice touch when you realize they probably had no budget for multiple cut-scenes, and looks stylistic(though not everyone will like it. I find them to run a bit longer than they should be but ehhh).It won't be the best game you play this year, but it's worth the money you pay to get it and play through.Also, the main villain is voiced by Lo-Pan.

Like Kratos, Marlow isn't very good at platforming, but is pretty darn good at swinging.Unlike God of War, which takes itself way too seriously, Marlow is actually a pretty cool guy, he is very sarcastic and best of all, you are accompanied by an Aztec mask who will always have something funny to say, the bickering between these two always got a chuckle out of me.The editing between scenes can be jarring as it's clear most of the animations team effort went into the combat, you won't get much out of the cut scenes, nor will you really care either.That being said, the game play while not great for the platforming segments, is worth it for the excellent combat, doing insane combos and unleashing devastating elemental attacks is very satisfying, this is why it's okay to be a God of war clone, the God of war games are fun.The game also has a good amount of variety, there are the platforming segments which will probably kill you more than the combat segments, there are a good number of different enemies to fight (for a 6-7 hour game anyway) and there are fantastic action segments such as scenes where you are hanging on to a helicopter for dear life (there are even segments from other game genres that took me by surprise in a good way).This was honestly a pretty unique and satisfying experience for me, a short little game you go into knowing it'll be cheesy, silly and even stupid at times, but is a fun experience regardless, I played the game a month ago within a few days and still remember it fondly, it's not for everyone, but give this a go if you like beat-em-ups or action games in general, it's over the top, silly, action packed and a lot of fun."

However, upon actually playing the game, I realized how wrong I was.Firstly, it is an incredible drag to play; the combat is astoundingly dull, which is says a lot, considering that the game does try to change the weapons you're using and enemies being thrown at you somewhat frequently. The gameplay outside of combat is no better; there are numerous puzzle and platforming sections, but I found these areas just a hassle; I ran into numerous glitches, (character unable to climb up walls, character glitching through walls, etc.) which was only made worse by the fact that the puzzles, I felt, lacked any real challenge.(I will now discuss the issue of the game taking itself seriously, this is a personal preference when it comes to cheesy games, so you can disregard this section if you'd like, [skip to next paragraph] but I feel it's worth saying) Secondly, and by far one of my biggest complaints, the game takes itself way too seriously. What I mean by this is, the game, or I suppose the creators, really, could not see how ridiculous and cheesy the plot, characters, cut-scenes, and overall feel of the game is; they want us to look at the game as a serious work meant to inspire powerful emotion, instead of a tongue-in-cheek ride meant to entertain. Aside from the fact that this is a serious missed opportunity, as it shows an incredible amount of potential to be a wonderful parody game. it completely broke the immersion; I was never able to get fully involved and feel the emotions the game was trying to invoke, because all the situations were too ridiculous for me to be able to take seriously. It left me feeling disinterested; further worsening how much of a chore playing the game felt.Thirdly, the plot in this game is heavily bogged down by the fact that I was completely unable to sympathize with the protagonist, and worse yet, I actually sympathized with the antagonists, as technically, they did nothing wrong and it was actually the hero who started the conflict, (I won't go further into this, as I would spoil what little there is to be spoiled). This left me actually rooting for the villains to win, and gave me no drive to push forward through the campaign; why go through the effort if I can't sympathize with the hero or his plight?All in all, I simply cannot recommend this game. I found it completely unenjoyable, and would hate to see another person buy this game only to have the same conclusion. I only hope that if the developers do decide to come out with another game, they can learn from the mistakes made in Marlow Briggs, and produce a high-quality product for us all to enjoy."

Enemies are varied as are locations. Boss battles are quite lame, but brief.The game makes no premises about what it is and is filled with self-parody and stupidity all the way through it's ""story"". Cutscenes and characters are laughably plastic and the game even has an achievement for skipping all cutscenes, which I thoroughly recommend on ""achieving"". 5-6 hours of fun and enjoyable combat and great colourful levels, supplemented by dumb and hilarious commentary of a talking Mayan mask are definitely worth this game's asking price.""If only there was a conveniently-placed AA gun for me to deal with all these helicopters..."""

Sure it copies a decent amount of its tricks from the God of War formula, but in all honestly, that's not really a bad template to borrow from.  Throw in a little bit of Indiana Jones, 70s blaxploitation film-making, B action movies, nonsensical comedy and you've got the vibe for this game down pat.  I actually enjoyed this game more than alot of big budget games from the same genre.Briggs isn't a perfect game, yet it does so much right that I couldn't stop playing until I completed the hardcore mode today, FINALLY.  In Marlow Briggs you are killed by an evil Chinese magnate who wants to rule the world with a frightening, sort of terraforming magical power.  He kills you and kidnaps your girlfriend, though thankfully Marlow is brought back by a wise-cracking mask that guides him through his journey to save the girl, the day and the world.  The entire premise is ridiculous.  Once you're having fun with the game, the plot hardly even matters.At its core, Briggs is a hack n' slashers delight.  You arm yourself with several types of melee weapons, magic, long range attacks and acrobatic abilities.  As you fight and explore, you earn experience to upgrade your powers, making you a killing machine on a machine.  You'll explore crazy industrial complexes, temples, caves, jungles and much more.  While graphically, Marlow and the gang aren't the best game in town; he surely isn't the worst looking either.  Levels are solidly detailed with lots to peer at in the distance and the enviroments look good while alternately being a blast to travel.  There's hidden secrets to find and numerous achievements to unlock.  There is also a hardcore mode on hand that will test your skills for certain.  It's not as impossible as Deadlight, but it will put up a stiff challenge and make you sing for your supper.You upgrade with new equipment at key points of the game while fighting legions of foes that include all sorts of armed guards, giant insects, mythical looking boss creatures, teleporting evil priests, giants, a wolf like Hellbeast and other assorted demons.  The boss fights are a blast, and require quicks hands, strategic use of attacks/abilities and old fashioned pattern memorization.  That's really all there is to it!  The campagin is a decent length with alot of areas to explore and frequent differences in scenery so that you'll rarely be bored and when you're not fighting like a champ there are all sorts of gameplay variations to keep things exciting.  You'll man gun turrets, fly choppers and fighter planes while shooting down everything in sight, use your nimble abilities to platform your way to victory, etc.  The controls were mostly tight and responsive, so it's easy to get yourself in the action and stay there.  While I expected minimal of this game, I got way more than I bargained for and put in 28.7 hrs to beat it twice and get most of the achievements (97%).   Hell, once weakening certain monsters like the club wielding giants and monster scorpions, you can even ride and use them to fight Golden Axe style!On the downside, sometimes the controls do tend to get a little wacky and combo stringing won't feel entirely accurate, making for a cheap death or two.  The QT buttom presses to hammer down on certain bosses and deal decisive blows don't always register, which also got me slaughtered a couple of times as well.  While not with the frequency of a survival horror game, the camera has potential to get a little rickety and you'll end up taking a beating from some foes you can't even see.  All of the problems with the game were rather minor and I actually thought this game was HIGHLY addicting and entertaining to play.  To be honest...I like it more than some of the God of War sequels.  You can scream blasphemy all you want, but that's how I felt.  Another downside is that the slow-motion cut scenes could have been better executed and the voice acting isn't top-notch (although its rampant cheesiness is rather endearing as this game is straight out of one of those B movie action 4 packs).  Overall, anyone into the hack n' slash genre would do well to check this out for the cheap price.  I hope they make a sequel with co-op!  Good lord, that'd be a blast.Now for some quick pros and cons:Pros-Solid graphics and sound-Excellent set of weapons, abilities and magic-90% of the time the fighting is fluid and fun-Superb enemy variety with tough fights and killer battles with monstrous bosses-Campy storyline and voice-acting adds to the appeal-Combos are easy to execute and satisfying- 90% of the time the controls are response and fun-Great gameplay variety with everything listed above and even a few puzzlesCons-10% of the time the fighting can be a little clunky-10% of the time some button presses won't register, especially the QT sequences (fortunately they are few)-Platforming is a beotch when the controls stutterOverall:  8.2/10"

The gameplay is fantastic, with a character action-based style of liner gameplay, and four very fun movesets based on the weapons you unlock, each with it's own set of satisfying combos. The environments convey an enormous sense of scale, and the camera tricks you into thinking things look much bigger than they are. The environments are very surprisingly gorgeous at times, and the graphics on the PC are surprisingly fantastic. The action is awesome and very over-the-top, with an increase in scale and buildup that rivals that of Platinum's action games, and the fighting levels are broken up by decently lengthy minigames throughout, including an on-rails shooter boss battle and a shoot-em-up helicopter section. Even the end credits are a minigame (which sure beats most credits sequences in terms of enjoyability!). The characters are just developed and fun enough to make a VERY STUPID, yet enjoyable and decently funny story, and the main villain, (also extremely racist) is a very satisfying enemy to face in the final boss battle.

You have light and heavy attacks creating different combinations, blocks to reflect enemy projectiles, dodging, and magic.+4 different weapons and magic to fit your play style+ Throughout the game you will visit interesting locations each providing its own unique action set pieces. The game does a good job of varying up the gameplay to a certain degree to keep things interesting.+easy achievements+The game is short but I consider that pretty good for this game because it doesn't wear out its welcome, it does everything it sets out to do.The Bad:- The game itself is very competently made, however its biggest ""flaw"" is that it is very unoriginal. God of War came out before this game and does just about everything better in every category. This is the biggest clone of God of War I have ever seen, from the combat to the platforming to the moves. This in itself isn't bad as many games copy each other however this game brings absolutely nothing new to the table. I know you should judge a game on its own merits but its highly obvious the developers looked at God of War and re-skinned it.- The story is an afterthought and serves as an excuse for you to kill lots and lots of enemies. After the first 5 minutes of the game the entire story is laid out before you. It doesn't help that the dialogue is terrible.- Every character in the game is generic, its hard to care about anyone in the game- Outside of combat the platforming and controls can be a bit flaky at times.ConclusionIf you are looking for a fun mindless action game, then look no further, given the price of the game this is probably one of the better values you will find. If you enjoyed God of War then you should check this game out as its the closest thing you're going to play on steam."

He has also done a insane amount of other movies and voice-overs, including work in Diablo 3.The game loads up and just starts right away. No menu, nothing, just begins with the opening sequence. But it is automatically set at my resolution and refresh rate with vsync on which blows my mind that this obscure game can do that and hardly any other game can. I ALWAYS have to check res and vsync first thing in any game I ever start up for the first time. So hats off to this game for that, golf clap.This first thing you will immediately notice within the first ten seconds is that your guy has a serious medical condition: his veins in his arms bulge out so much that they exist completely on the outside of his arms. No doubt they were trying to make him look ripped and badass but no man I have ever seen has veins that bulge to a point of being external. Hopefully I come across a medical clinic soon in the game to have that fixed or pick up a health pack or something.By far the best deal and fun-to-dollar ratio of any game I have ever bought on steam. It was only 99 cents and it is a very good AAA game that was overlooked when it was released. It is a rail action game, meaning you do not control the camera, it just moves with you as you go along in the game. It actually works fine too this way. It's the same rail action as a game like Narco Terror. The gameplay is solid and flows nicely, and is much akin to the God of War games. The graphics are great, the entire game looks very good. Very vibrant with awesome effects. The story is instantly forgettable. If I want a good story I will play a RPG or read a book. The last place I would ever look for a good story is a action game, and there are very few exceptions.It is really amazing that I found this gem on sale for only a dollar. If you are an action game fan there is no reason you should not like this unless you are ignorant. Since most players on steam play garbage like DayZ, then you probably already are dumb beyond words. It really is a pretty fun and well done solid game. 8/10"

It's a pretty standard formula of action adventure games akin to the likes of Darksiders, God of War, and Devil May Cry, and it might do everything that's been done before, but it does so very well and manages to stay fun throughout.The gameplay is nicely balanced between combat sections, platforming, puzzles, and mini-games. You're never doing the same thing for too long, which keeps the experience fresh and entertaining. As you progress through the game, your weapon acquires different forms (scythe, twin daggers, whip, and hammer), which are useful in different situations and you can switch between them at any time.

There were no unexpected difficulty spikes and most of it was a smooth ride. In the last quarter of the game it gets a bit challenging, but it does so gradually and reasonably. Only one section involving a certain collapsing underground bridge felt a bit cheap since it gave me a lot of insta-deaths, but that section was pretty short.I really enjoyed most of the mini-games, such as the first-person shooting sections where you have to mount a turret and shoot down helicopters, or even flying one yourself, or sliding down the cliffs and dodging obstacles. No overcomplicated mechanics. Just simple and fun mini-games to give you a small break from fighting and platforming.The plot is somewhat cheesy and lighthearted, but the main character is quite likeable, and his frequent dialogue exchanges with his sidekick, the Mask of Death, are all very funny. The length was also quite spot on for a game like this. Took me about 10 hours to beat it on Normal.My only serious critique for this game would be the occasional crashes to desktop that I got (and it seems there are some other people who get them too). It wasn't too bad, since the game has very frequent checkpoints, so you don't lose a lot of progress, but it's still a bug.I'd say if you enjoy action adventure games and seek something to give you heaps of entertainment, then I'd highly recommend this game. I got it for merely £4 (~$6), which is its full price on Steam and enjoyed it way more than some games which I bought for a higher price."

Great voice acting throughout.  The writing is schlocky and fun, but really dumb.Overall, a nice throwback to 80's achlock action movies that ends up being not especially fun to see through to the end.

The hero, unsurprisingly named Marlow, is portrayed by Arif Kinchen (aka Pierce from Saints Row), you've also got James Hong (Mr. Ping from Kung Fu Panda), and Steve Blum (Tom from Toonami, and pretty much everything else in existence with a voice actor). The bantor and the comedy is there, even though the game ""acts"" like it takes itself seriously, more on that in a bit...I've never played a God of War game, but having seen some gameplay videos from that landmark franchise I can see where the parallels are drawn from.  I played most of my playthrough with a Steam Controller using the default gamepad template Steam offers for all titles and it felt very natural.  I couldn't comment on the keyboard/mouse input as I have yet to give it a chance, but I also played the intro with a 360 controller just fine, so if you have a gamepad laying around you should give it a shot on this title as it has console roots, both mechanic and development wise.Speaking of development, where in xibalba did this game even come from?  I remember the tweet for the release going live on the official Steam accounts, but prior to that ZootFly was never on my radar.  Even looking into their catalog, Marlow Briggs seems like a diamond in the rough.  The game launched on PC and Xbox 360 as an Arcade title, but sports graphics that would be at home on most AAA console titles from the 360/PS3 era.  There is a decent variety of enemies, with new variations and additions being thrown at you right until the end.  The settings alternate between Mesoamerican ruins that leave you wondering ""how the heck did they build something so ginormous?"", and humongous industrial complexes/machines that leave you wondering ""why the heck did they build something so ginormous?"".  The weapons and powers follow an experience based upgrade system, but the game is plenty generous with xp pickups and you usually end up maxing out your new unlocks not too long after receiving them.The plot, and even in some portions the animation and voice acting can be received in two different ways-1. So cheesey and jenky that it circles around to become awesome again.2. Purposefully made super duper cheesey and jenky, which means it was done with just as much heart, so also making it awesome.I mean, there are scenes where your goal is to ""shoot down all the helicpoters"" and the game proceeds to throw nearly a 100 choppers at you.  Who has that many choppers on standby?  Who is that 100th chopper that sees the first 99 explode in front of him that says ""Ef it, yolo"" and continues to come at you guns blazing?  Also there's a scene where you fly a generic prop plane like Xevious and it somehow has the payload capacity for a bunch of heat seeking rockets AND machine guns under the propeller. I know, I know: What. Even.Either way, I'm not quite sure Zootfly knows what they've got with this franchise but the cliffhangerish ending demands a sequel with just as much over the top action, explosions, and lulzy dialog."

Likewise, I ran into a few sections where the camera moves while you're supposed to be moving and it threw off the jump, leading me to more than one unfortunate and frustrating death.That being said, the game has pretty decent humor and it knows its place in the game pantheon.

The puzzles are insultingly easy, the stylized cutscenes (that were taken from the first GoW) are painfully slow and boring, the story itself is horrendously dull even for a game like this and the combat just didn't cut it.

A game can be very intriguing, but not necessarily fun, and I can enjoy it immensely --take puzzle games, for instance, or Phoenix Wright. Vice versa, you have games like Team Fortress 2, where there's not much intrigue in story or setting but a ton of carnal fun. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death lacks any 'umph' in either of those two elements.Sure, the game can be occasionally fun. The game play is very Devil May Cry styled, quick, fierce, and sharp. The magic you get in the game, though limited, is quite satisfying, and the landscapes are generally pretty. Too often though did I find myself bored when I was chugging through the fighting segments, or struggling through some of the game's numerous mini-games. That's almost a kiss of death for a game centered around combat and platforming.On the flip side, the game is only sort of intriguing. MBMD is just brimming with explosions, and it's sprinkled with a B-movie style humor that's actually quite charming. Only thing is, it loses its charm fast. Flat characters and a bland, almost predictable story keep this game from being interesting for me, and the flat voice acting and bland animation from everyone else beside the main characters just feels stale.So for the most part, I really don't recommend this game. It's far from bad, but there's so much else out there that is worth playing more, unless you're really hungry for another platformer."

I think they wanted to make a franchise out of this, what with the character's name on the damn title. Too bad it's all mediocre.The combat is of the button mashing variety. There are plenty of combos that take the form of a light and heavy attack, with combinations being strung together. The problem with that sort of combo system is that you can't expect me to remember all the 'XXXY, XXXX, XYXX, YXXY' combos. It winds up just being a button masher with a combo system that has too much to memorize for it's own good. You wind up memorizing three or so moves and just constantly mash those out.It's boring as hell. Simplicity isn't bad, route memorization is. Metal Gear Rising had a similar set-up, but the memorization was kept to a minimum. The fun in combat lied in keeping your blue gauge up and getting those quick kills. The Arkham titles have an even simpler battle system, with the challenge being in continuing your chain of attack while thwarting enemies with properly placed counters. Marlow Briggs presents nothing unique or interesting in its combat. It's just randomly hitting buttons with the challenge lying in simply keeping your health gauge up. There's nothing rewarding in the combat itself.Apart from the mediocre combat, the game has light platforming and puzzle elements. When you aren't busy fighting, you'll be traversing the level with fixed camera angles. The platforming is all pretty barebones and boils down to jumping across pits and pressing the action button when appropriate. Swinging from cliffs and walking across ledges would be a lot more exciting if there was any sort of challenge to it beyond pressing a button. The fact that the camera angles are fixed means that there's not even any challenge in finding how to proceed. It's all meant to look nice and tantamount to simply pressing right on the joystick while ocassionally hitting the B button to jump across the ocassional pit. Again, it's boring.On the positive side of things, the game looks gorgeous for a budget title. I got it for 99 cents a few sales ago, and can't comprehend how such a cheap♥♥♥♥♥title can look so damn good. There's even some creativity in the way some of the cutscenes unfold.Otherwise, it's all mediocre and completely forgettable.

If you don't know who James Hong is, he's the ""I just do eyes"" character on Blade Runner whom Roy Batty isn't very nice to, as well as Po's adoptive father on Kung-Fu Panda, and Covetous Shen on Diablo III, among many other roles. He's a delight to hear do his work, and this game is no different, even if the characters are all pretty flat - which is okay, given the B movie vibe. I can't remember the music, though I don't recall awkward silence, either, so no qualms on that front.The B-movie vibe is fun, but other aspects of the game need to shine. Although things can be corny or awkward and still be fun, everything else needs to ""feel"" right, and certain things didn't sit well with me. First off, the game's cutscenes are often freeze-frame camera pans. These are cool for showing you certain details you might have missed, but they really drag on for far too long, and skipping them had me worried I'd miss something plot-relevant. Also, the combat is clearly taken right out of God of War. This isn't a problem, except God of War continually entertained me with a longer playtime, while Marlow Briggs often had me feeling bored despite its 8 or so hours of playtime.It took me a while to realize what was boring me, but the bullet-spongy quality of some enemies really got old. You don't shoot enemies, but I'm saying that quite a few enemies had so much health, that I just got tired of beating on them. I found myself shouting ""just die already!"" within about 10 minutes or so of the final battle, and was on the verge of quitting and uninstalling out of sheer annoyance at how long repetitive fights went on. I only pushed on to complete the game because I knew I was right at the finish line.Although this game does have a lot of charm and is of surprising quality at its pricepoint, I can't recommend a game that bored me during much of its playtime, only tempting me to complete it becausehowlongtobeat.comshowed just how short it was, and because so many other players seemed to adore it.

This is a $5 game and a pretty solid example of getting what you pay for.The gameplay is decent, pretty good actually, but the story is slow and the platforming sections often feature really frustrating and stupid pixel-perfect jumps. Graphics are... decent.The combat is pretty solid though, with a variety of weapons and spells. Unfortunately you might have a hard time executing your combos when your framerate suddenly drops into the single digits for no identifiable reason. On top of that, the controls are pretty... weird. with dual mapping between mouse buttons and i, o and p, for one example. This leads to some confusion when QTEs reference one set of these controls when you're using the other. On top of that, the game refuses to accept any controller that isn't an XBox 360 controller, so if you have a logitech gamepad or something else, sorry, but you're screwed. Lern2Joy2Key.Overall, I would recommend this to someone who likes this kind of game, if not for the porting issues and DRM. The DRM is of the ""♥♥♥♥ your progress the connection dropped so I'm kicking you back to main menu"" variety. If you don't have a stable internet connection, I would strongly advise you stay far away from this game entirely."

By that, I mean that it crashes all the damn time, and it tears up so frequently, that it's not even funny. It barely ever runs over 30 fps, even with 800x600 resolution. There is a bunch of unnecessary padding and quicktime events that just serve to waste your time, since they are not challenging, fun or add to the game in any way.

It's a budget title from ZootFly, famous for their Ghostbusters demo they released a few years before the actual game from Atari.  On paper, its a generic action game. You play Marlow Briggs, you work on a rig?..., bad guys come after you, you get infused with the power of the jungle, now you can fight the bad guys.But Marlow Briggs, to experience Marlow Briggs, is entirely different thing all together.Imagine, almost to a fault, a Sony all-stars mashup. Imagine the world of Nathan Drake's Uncharted, invaded by a mildly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Kratos, who is guided along his journey by the “Aku-Aku” mask from Crash Bandicoot, roll them together like a Katamari Damacy ball and you have Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death.This game, is for lack of a better definition a B-Game. It's story doesn't rival any of the before mentioned games, and it isn't trying to. Marlow is a clever mix, cherry picked from the finest parts of other games, and created it's own awe inspiring game.  It's fun, the action is constant and enjoyable. The story is simple, but the characters are interesting. Marlow is a tough, but soft hero, imagine a Keith David meets Sidney Poitier. He's a character who can be kind, but shake some sass if he has to. He's followed by the Mask of Death, who like the Aku-Aku mask follows the player around, providing the comic relief and instructional help.The action is non stop. It just keeps blasting right around you. The gameplay is almost exactly like God of War or DMC, hack and slash, mowing down enemys left and right.For $5.00, or if you've purchased it during the summer sale for $0.99, Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a fantastic game. It has the polish and action of a AAA title, not a budget title, and could serve as the perfect black sheep to the family of Sony games that inspired it's creation.A must buy."

The sale is over and the game's regular price is 5 bucks. Is it worth it's regular price? Absolutely.This game is the closest that exclusive PC gamers who refuse to game on a console will ever get to playing God of War. As a huge God of War fan I can tell you that Marlow Briggs gets the job done as the combat system is near identical and feels just as good as God of War. I will say that the quick time events are much more forgiving in this game and they do not seem to be as well placed as they are in God of War. However the story is much more light hearted and humerous, so the game does not take itself seriously in the slightest which is good. If you get this game do yourself a favor and turn the music and sound effects down so you can hear the dialog durring gameplay. What I really like about this game is that it has added some variety to the God of War formula by having places where you need to shoot things down with big gun turrets and added rooms with moving obstacles to avoid while fighting enemies. Some of the game's cutscenes are a bit too dragged out with the whole Matrix like, slow camera panning scenes which only seem to slow things down, but every cutscene is 100% skippable if you feel the game is dragging which is a great feature. Also just like God of War, I felt the game was a little too easy on the normal difficulty so I recommend the hard difficulty to really heat things up and to make fights not feel so one sided.In the end, wether you pay a buck or five bucks, you will have a good time.

I recently played X-blades (which is terrible) and was shocked to find how much of a disaster the controls were, playing Marlow briggs feels as tight as playing Dark Siders or Devil may cry ( but not DmC that one sucked a big butt).The whole game from voice acting, art style and writing are all meant to convey a certain kind of ""cheese"" but there are genuine moments of deep content and criticism of the videogame narative.Have you ever played a game and wondered how workers in the factory actually got over these jumps and dodged the steam pipes and flame pillars? Well in Marlow Briggs the game explains that the workers in the ore refinery actually sabotaged the building by removing ladders, breaking platforms and turning the flames on. Making the level design actually have a place in the world, unlike a lot of games where only the protagonist could actually navigate them making them non functional or convoluted.Small fourth wall breaking features and moments in the dialogue that poke fun at the narrative of videogames really help build a relationship with the main charactersCheck out my lets play of Marlow Briggs atyoutube.com/Deppresso"

The plot is silly, which is what makes this enjoyable. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death goes over the top from the first second and never looks back.The port is so-and-so, and some might have a hard time adjusting to the controls, which at times are very clunky. The fighting system is sufficient, although some weapons and powers are fairly useless from the get go, while others become your bread and butter the second you unlock them.This is a high action brawler with little room for breaks. Unfortunately, several enemies are downright boring to fight, and after a while become overly repetitive. The final boss is suitable for a game like this, but I personally found it to be a chore more than enjoyable.All in all, if you want several hours worth of entertaining brawling and like B film plots and dialogue, this is well worth picking up."

I do not ever recall this game being advertised but it is a good game.The main villian is trying to get immortality. He enlists the help of your girlfriend.

As far as the plot goes, that is about it.For a pretty straight forword storyline, you travel to many locations and fight a good variety of creatures. The boss battles are interesting and cool looking.The things that will annoy you  in this game are first off the talking mask that follows you. He is not very informative and seams to suffer from exceptional hindsite. Secondly at certain parts of the game (mostly when getting new upgrades or end of boss battles) the game does a stop motion revolving take of what is going on. As it turns the scenes change and then you go on into the next area. Way to often! Lastly THE INVISIBLE WALLS. there are times when you plan a jump only to hit an invisible wall killing you prompting that mask to make another snide remake about how that should not of happened.All in all it is a good game with decent fighting mechanics.

Marlow Briggs proves that this is not always the case.Despite the low budget, the game boasts an amazing presentation on par with most AAA-games.The gameplay is also really fun, a lot like God of War in a good way. Not only is the combat and platforming really fun, with great controls and a great variety of weapons and combos, but there is also variety in gameplay-styles, so things don't get too repetitive.The story itself is really simple: Save your girlfriend from her evil boss.However, the aforementioned presentation and the characters really make the experience very enjoyable.Marlow Briggs himself is a very badass and likeable character (not to mention, a rare black protagonist that isn't a stereotypical gangsta), and King Tep, the titular Mask of Death, is a hilarious companion, with praise going to Steve Blum's funny and over-the-top performance. The witty conservations between them really makes the characters memorable, not to forget the hilarious despicable villain.The only negative thing that I can think of, is the fact that you can't change the graphical settings, so people with not-as-powerful computers/laptops are going to have problems running the game at a decent framerate, unlees you change the resolution.In short, a very enjoyable fighter with a b-movie-feel, but in good way, since the game itself has fun with it.If you like games like God of War, and enjoy movies like the ones Michael Bay makes, then Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is an awesome game :D :D"

I had no idea this game had even existed until I picked it up during a Steam sale and now that I've played through it, wonder why I had put off doing that for so long.Briggs is as close to a God of War game on Steam as you might get with enough differences to help it stand out. Instead of an angry deathdealer in ancient Greece, you play modern nice-but-tough guy, Marlow Briggs, who was killed while visiting his girlfriend working on researching ruins in the jungle thanks to a generous benefactor.Unfortunately for Briggs and for her, her boss turns out to be supervillain material voiced by James Hong (Big Trouble in Little China) who funded her research and now wants her to complete her work after having killed Briggs to prove that he's serious. The thing is, Briggs was killed with a sacred weapon attached to a talking jade mask of a dead king with a smartass tongue who has brought him back to exact vengeance and stop the bad guy before he becomes a god.Briggs will eventually wield four different weapons to destroy everyone in his way: a dual bladed staff (which he starts with), dual obsidian blades, a chain for distance, and a heavy scythe-hammer thing. He'll also get four different powers along the way: a fire devastation spell, a strength enhancement spell, a freeze spell, and a hurricane spell. The controls feel really geared for a gamepad even though there are keyboard and mouse options (I highly suggest using a gamepad; I played this using an Xbox 360 controller). The learning curve is pretty shallow and before long, I was switching up weapons and sending enemies to Xibalba like it was second nature.Enemies consist of humans to giant, flying bugs and undead warriors. And there's traps -- lots of jumping, swinging across chasms, dodging, climbing on vines, sliding, and eventually, gliding with plenty of upgrade points (to improve weapons and magic powers, both of which also increase your health and magic gauges respectively) hidden everywhere on each level. Enemies also drop a bit of experience, heals, and magic energy. Generously placed red (for health) and blue (for magic) masks replenish everything to keep Briggs in fighting shape.When it comes to looks, the game has quite a bit of eye candy. Some areas look a lot better than others, but the detail in some of the ancient temples and ruins really stand out. There are vast industrial complexes, mines, giant digging machines (some of which you have to avoid), a mobile factory, sprawling ruins, giant cliffs, and all of it wants to take you out sooner or later with the help of an army of foes ranging from human thugs to half-serpent humanoids that can disappear into the ground right before a giant scorpion comes out to play.Aside from wielding his arsenal of weapons, Briggs can also grab enemies, toss them off into the wild blue yonder, into a giant fan, stomp on bugs (which can really get abused), all the while spouting one liners with a possessed mask. If you feel a groan coming on when you see some kind of ridiculous fire trap ahead, chances are Briggs is going to sympathize with you and that the mask will reminisce about human sacrifice again. This is a game that ever so slightly nudges the fourth wall and has fun with its own material. It's not a heavy serious kind of adventure -- just a game that has as much fun with its characters as you might be with the action.From start to finish, this is a complete action adventure deal with decent voice acting, great music, nice visuals, plenty of action, and even a few puzzles for good measure thrown in with a solid ending that makes it worth getting to.The worse thing I can probably say is that the game won't make your reflexes sweat too much. This is partly due to its incredibly quick reloads and the option to manually save pretty much anywhere which goes far in alleviating any potential repetition. Most of the fights aren't too rough and the boss fights won't put your controllers at risk from the frustration that might otherwise twist them into pretzels as with other games.There are some close calls, but it seems that the game was designed to make you feel like a total 80s action hero and for the most part, it works, especially when you're flying through the air on a helicopter platform blown off a building while still being chased by choppers.If you've had experience with God of War, this won't be that much of a challenge, but it's still a nice trip into the danger zone with a great character who just wants to go out there and kick♥♥♥♥♥to rescue his girlfriend from James Hong."

The only change here is the combat feels slower and clunkier, they have a black protaganist instead of a white one, and they changed the lore from greek to... african I guess? Im not really sure if the lore is made up or if its based on some tribal history.And that camera angel... The entire game is fixed camera. Which means it tells you where to go and what to look at and the platforming you'll be doing is harder because you cant judge distance. This means you will fail time and time again trying to make that jump or dodge that moving platform.The game isnt terrible but when all you offer different from your competition is a change of story then I have to ask, ""why do you exist?"""

The plot is simple but neat, and the villian is pretty wonderfully awful.

I got the feeling those parts were not meant to be confusing, just badly thought out. It just became frustrating. The controls and camera angle changes reminded me of ""Landstalker,"" and could be confusing during parts of the game that required careful control or even just pushing objects around.Overall it's a good game but I would prefer the challenge come from harder enemies or outright proper puzzles than just confusing terrain. I spent more time timing jumps than actually fighting, so it felt like more of a puzzle game than a hack and slash.I played a few hours but I don't think I'll ever finish it.

It is start-to-finish fast-paced hack-n-slash third-person action and fun set-pieces, only slowing down due to the incompetence of the player, yet even then the game is always pushing you in the right direction. At one point I was stuck and the Mask (companion) gave hints within 1 minute of me running around, and another minute later told me to just push the cart into the pistons, which was all I had to do. The game is also very forgiving with a ridiculous frequency of checkpoints.I wasn't even caring about the collectibles and the game still lasted me about 6 hours, 6 hours of straight and varied action with just a touch of puzzle-solving, no filler whatsoever. Looking back the combat seemed a little repetitive, though I guess that was just me using the same combos over and over. People are right when they say it is similar to God of War, though GOW is not on PC....The game has an incredibly low asking price on steam, let alone sale price.

And it is largely those things, but it's still not far from being mediocre.What the game has going for it is its cheesy, self-aware humor, and it did a great job of delivering on it. I smiled and got some genuine joy out of that aspect quite a number of times. I also enjoyed the set-pieces and technical-efficiency of the game. But past those, it's pretty much your run-of-the-mill CAG/hack-n-slash.After the novelty wore-off for me (maybe 2 hours in), I started to get increasingly bored as I progressed because the combat just didn't deliver. It's your standard button-masher where victory comes relatively easily, and where ""Hard"" mode doesn't make the game more difficult, but more tedious (eg, less forgiving, so you have to be more liberal with dodging, damage-sponge enemies). Any time I got into an enemy encounter, and couldn't just run past them or quickly kill them by throwing them off a cliff, I would find myself falling asleep, doing the same attacks and dodges repeatedly until everything was dead.Some other aspects that detracted were:The puzzles. They were all mind-numbingly easy, and executing them felt like a punishment.The on-rails sections and quick-time events, because they took-away agency from me.The story. I did mention that the game was pretty funny, and it is, but the story really is nothing special. And the ""panorama""-style cutscenes -- which I took great indulgence in the first few times -- eventually got old and hampered the pace of the game. The audio-logs were also pretty pointless.Overall, Marlow Briggs is beautiful, funny, and a very competent budget-priced game. But for those who have high standards for games in this genre (think: Ninja Gaiden II), it just doesn't hold-up."

I dont know what caused them, but it took me about 5 DAYS to get past one particular scene cause it crashed every time there- the actual story is quite good, but Id have loved a bit more chat between Marlow and the Mask at the start. It kinda was ""Hey, Im ressurected by this mask. I shouldnt question it one bit and start my rampage imediately""... this was a bit of wasted potential here.- the explosion effects where too much at a few times, making it hard to dodge attacks.As I said, Id recommend this game.

,Recommended,249680,12974651,"Posted: 16 November, 2014",all,ref,"Decided to write a small opinion about the game since almost no-one from my friendlist have it in their library.tl;dr: I liked it. Really funny spectacle fighter/brawler game.More:It's a your-standard-generic-brawler game, like any DmC or Batman games this days, yet it offers a nice original story to it placed in Mayan ruins (or Aztecs, or Toltecs, or w/e ;)). There are small glitches here and there, the combat system is not as refined as in DmC, but it was a pleasure playing it.You are a man who visits your Ancient South America (later referred to as ASA) linguist girlfriend and suddenly you are killed because reasons (not only monsters, but people as well don't like you in this game). However, the weapon you were killed with was possessed by some god of ASA and he recognizes you as The Spirit Warrior who will bring peace to this part of Earth. And so you get resurrected and have a scythe to get through hoardes of mercenaries, possessed mercenaries, ASA warriors and other monsters and gods from ASA believes.During your progress you get more weapons (in total: scythe, rouge-like weapon - my fav, whip with a blade and warhammer with one side bladed) as well as learn some magic by defeating gods (fire, earth, ice and wind). Spells are summoned by using mana.You replenish you health by collecting red orbs/masks and mana by collecting blue ones. Your abilities can by upgraded by collecting enough of yellow ones. However the upgrades are simple: each weapon and spell has three levels, and with each level you get more dmg with it, unlock 2 new moves and your health or mana base value gets higher. It's much simpler than in e.g. Darksiders: there you needed to think what to put your exp into, but here, as the weapons and spells are added to your arsenal in balanced manner, almost always you'd get one thing upgraded before having the other one obtained. With that in mind, the fight system is extremely expanded and the actions you get through sometimes are the typical Hollywood star Bruce Willis level of awesomeness actions.The biggest issue I had with the game was the mana system. When you are fully upgraded you get to fire exactly 2 spells. But the mana bar doesn't indicate you in any way if you have enough mana to cast the spell, so you mash the buttons once or twice trying to see if it can work. As stated previously, mana is obtainable in form of blue masks (placed directly on map) or blue orbs (flying out of defeated opponent). As fights are mostly in closed area arenas with god-knows-how-much-opponents going to jump at you in next wave (if there will be any, who knows), you try to limit the usage of blue masks nearby. After you die two or three times to some bigger tank monsters and even start using the masks because why the hell not, you find yourself in a place where you need a smallest amount of mana to use the spell one more time, but it doesn't regenerate in time, and isn't replenished with inflicted damage, so you spend time and time until you finish the monster, and voila, blue f-ing orbs which you don't need anymore. And before next fight it is certain that more than one blue mask will appear.Another problem I had were some mini-missions/challenges where you would slide down and had to avoid rocks, pits etc. Alice: Nightmare Returns had some similar sequences, but in here the time between when you push the jump button and when it is registered by the character in game was many times too big for me and I've spent countless times on some of those agility jobs.And one smallest issue: the game needs some power to run smoothly. On my machine DmC was running 60fps on 1080p max settings while this one had to be changed to 720p and some of the graphic options needed to be disabled. I know that Unreal Engine which DmC was running on was tended professionally through years, and I have no idea what was Marlow Briggs build on, but I would expect a little more from the game fidelity.Except of those two and a half points above the game was really nice: the story was addictive, the fight system, combos included, was sensationally developed and fluent, graphics caught your eyes and had some great sceneries and the music was always on spot. Also, your mask-god companion has a great sense of sarcastic humour and the voice acting for it is great, so you don't get bored.Having in mind that it is actually a budget game (€5 without a sale) this is probably one of the best fun to price factor games you can get right now.I do recommend this totally underestimated game, give it some love, ref!"

The combat is fun, the environments you play in are varied and interesting, and the over-the-top B-movie action and story that's barely contained within is totally self aware and absolutely just hamming it up. The studio used its clearly shoestring budget well and provides with a goofy game with great pacing, you're never in an area too long like other AAA titles.I'm actually laughing out loud at the absurdity going on while I play, Marlow Briggs goes from leaping off cliffs, fighting bad guys on a hunk of metal propelled at breakneck speed by explosions, to riding a giant scorpion.It's a fun ride without much depth, but at the price point it's money well spent. While I think the game is usually about $5I picked it up for $1. If you like the genre it's worth a buy. I doesn't have the story of God of War or the complex combo system of older Devil May Cry games, but the bonkers adventure it sends you on is worth it."

Easily the best quality to price ratio I've seen in years. You play as Marlow Briggs, a man who takes getting shot and being imbued with the power of ancient Mayan spirits all in stride. While they've traded Kratos' brooding for banter, the gameplay is identical to God of War: slash your way through bad guys, solve some minor puzzles, fight a boss.What's truly surprising is that the visuals are pretty close to the quality of a AAA series like GoW, the only time it's low budget becomes obvious is in the several cutscenes where they show a series of freeze-frames... it's a stylish presentation but it's pretty obvious they just didn't have the cash to do all the action.

Is this game just another mediocre God of War clone, or does it rise above that by being a hilarious and self aware budget game? Spoilers: it does.Story: Marlow Briggs takes place in South America, where your ladyfriend is translating ruins for a crazy businessman. When she tries to quit working for him, our protagonist Marlow is stabbed by a ancient Mayan weapon and killed. He is brought back to life by a talkative mask and goes out to kill the bad guy and save the girl. Pretty normal stuff. Anyway, it doesn't take itself seriously, and I did get quite a few laughs from the magical mask, who acts as the comic relief throughout the game, and gets some good banter with Marlow. Also the evil businessman is absolutely amazing, he has enough ham to feed a West Virginia family reunion (In case you didn't know, that is a lot of ham) It might not make much sense, but I had fun, and that's what matters.Graphics: Looks great, lots of colors, good animations for Marlow's attacks. Very few options on PC but runs smoothly, so I didn't mind. Not much to say here. One quick sidenote, why are some people saying the graphics in this are bad? It's a budget game, 15 bucks at launch man. Are people comparing this game's graphics to AAA 60 dollar games? Cause that doesn't make a whole lotta sense.Gameplay: The God of War comparison is easy to make, and it certainly follows the formula. Light and heavy attacks, combos, health and mana items, all of that stuff. Not being an expert at God of War (or any game, for that matter) I don't know the small details, for instance if the 43rd frame of Marlow's combo ruins the game or any super indepth thing like that. I can tell you the combat is smooth and responsive on keyboard and mouse, combos feel very natural to pull off,  dodging works effortlessly, and magic attacks feel very powerful and satisfying. It also has quite a bit of variety, platforming, very basic puzzle solving, and turret sections that don't overstay their welcome. Everything in this game works well, and controls pretty much perfectly. Here's a quick side thing, I didn't try using a controller, because the keyboard and mouse worked perfectly. As a guy raised on consoles, it's rare where I play an action game that feels flawless on Keyboard and mouse.Length and replay value: The game takes about 7.5 hours to beat, probably less if you don't suck as badly as myself. Not many reasons to replay unless you want to beat the game on hard mode.Should you get it? If you like fun games, I'd recommend it. If you don't like fun games, buy Call of Duty Ghosts instead. Just kidding! Even if you hate video games, don't buy Call of Duty Ghosts. Buy Marlow Briggs and give it to someone who likes games.Thanks for reading my review! My friend and I also have a youtube channel called, ""CultGamerAlliance"". Check it out if you get a chance!"

But don't judge so quickly it might have a linear storyline yet you encounter and experience the wildest things from hanging upside down on a helicopter to fighter a huge fish God. All while you try to save the ""Princess"" with your mask companion, who will bring all mental encouragement you need.Warning though some people might not enjoy the dialog, which is filled with cheesy comments, but also with funny comments of the ancient mask, who will tell you all about the Aztec culture and just generally comment in a funny way on what happening.Like I said earlier gameplay is fairly simple and you unlock 4 different weapons and 4 different spells plus a ranged attack as you progress. You also have a lot of time the possibility to mash the ""E"" button or the ""B"" button, if playing on a controller, which I found to be superior to the keyboard controls, but none the less you can play with keyboard, you'll be at a slight disadvantage against later enemies though. To no surprise, enemy variety is not that high, up until the last third of the game, where you encounter most of the bosses and harder enemies.Overall a very cheap and cheesy, but very fun game, if you enjoy over the top stupid games.

He awakens as the ""sacred warrior"", accompanied by an annoying talking mask, and must battle through hordes of mercenary mooks, jungles full of exploding bugs the size of dogs, scorpions the size of cars, and giant zombie warriors.Like its obvious antecedent God of War, it's a reasonably solid mix of platforming and button-mashing combat (long ""combos"" created through the light and heavy attack buttons, with four different weapons unlocked through the game), with occasional puzzles. As is often the case with this sort of design, it doesn't do any one thing particularly well -- the Arkham games ruined combat for everyone else, and it definitely gets repetitive here, and the platforming sequences are uninspiring make-work. There are also a number of strange mini-game sequences, e.g. manning a turret to shoot down helicopters and two instances of flying an aircraft in a particularly terrible Raiden-style top-down shooter.Where it really shines, though, like God of War, is as blockbuster spectacle -- a ""boss"" that's an enormous screen-filling sea monster, platforming through a collapsing mine etc. The story isn't much to write home about it but it provides a reason to hurtle from one explosive crisis to the next. It's entirely linear.The variety of environments and enemies is fairly good, though the game is relatively short (~6 hours). It's not stunningly polished; there are invisible walls everywhere, occasional issues with the controls etc.Some negative reviews here complain about checkpoint spacing, which I wuold agree with except that it appears to be possible to create your own checkpoint at any time with a quicksave from the menu.It's good fun and available so cheaply that it's well worth giving a go."

,Recommended,249680,29215461,Posted: 12 January,all,DrArchon,"Ambitious Schlock.  That's the best way to describe this game.  It's falling apart at the seems with framerate issues, glitches, crashes, and the like, but there's real heart here.  The devs really wanted to make a God of War style game for cheap, and if you can put up with some dull gameplay, annoying platforming, performance issues, and the like, you're in for a ride.Just don't buy this at full price."

Starts up a bit on the easy side, but some fight later on can be quite challenging. The combat system is well rounded, so is the enemy design. Transitions between levels could be handled with more grace, and the game acctually could use some quiet time - it's non stop crazy action.Overall, I had a lot of fun with it. Like a good popcorn action flick, highly reccomended considering the price. Acctually I belive it's worth ten buck instead of 5, price cuts notwithstanding.P.S. The person responsible for choosing the screenshots for the storefront did a terrible job, after the first (kinda borign) location, which is the source of all the screenshots, the game acctually looks really good."

It's over the top, and that's the point. Bought it on sale for 99 eurocents and for that price it's a must have.Be sure to check out the credits. Let's see how good you will do there...."
,Recommended,249680,29204523,Posted: 12 January,all,tankienmun,This is a action packed hack and slash game. I like it so much and enjoy the killing spree. The control is simple though graphic might not comparable to any recent titles yet acceptable. The pace of the game is just nice. It is a worth spent for a cheap price where it is currently on sale. Try it and you won't regret.The very first thing that bothered me is the screen display issue when I first launched the game. Do some compatibility changes then it worked flawlessly. I am so much into this game recently.Get it before the sale is gone. It is so much better than many action games.

The camera once pulled away until I can't see the character and all other models weren't loaded. In another stage, the character fell through the floor and die. These bugs aren't permanent though. After restarting the game, they're gone.You can max out every weapon and skill on the first run, so no replay value.It's less than a dollar on sale, so it's not bad for its price. The game runs smoothly on my PC.My PC: i7-6700, GTX 1060 (6GB), RAM 32GB, Windows 10 64 bit"

Not a real challenge - you can win any fight  mashing buttons and evading. Lame and porly animated platformimg. Nice graphics and a cheesey but funny story. Loads of explosions.

76561197976532859,Recommended,249680,29727485,Posted: 5 February,all,aerykz,"Okay, this is a fun game for a few bucks, but don't play full price. The story is B movie, which actually makes it kind of funny because it is so bad, but the action is alright. Limited combos, limited number of enemies, and not much exploration. Just a hack and slash style game. You can level up multiple specials and to keep the combat fresh you end up with 4 different types of weapon. I ended up just using the original weapon and the heavy weapon. Combos are pretty responsive and you can interrupt using a dodge.The only really poor thing IMO is that you cannot control the camera. Overall the game manages the camara pretty well, but I would have preferred the ability to control it myself. Fun game on sale, pretty short (about 6 hours)."

,Recommended,249680,29655121,Posted: 2 February,all,The Viking,"I've played this game for 2.9 hours so far and, no kidding, it's crashed and closed on me about 8 times now. Luckily, it autosaves often, loads up again quickly and when the game is running, it runs smoothly without lag. So, I don't know what's causing the crashes, but it's not the end of the world.Game itself is alright. Easy achievements. It's a decent price for what it is, and I got it even cheaper on a sale, so great. It's just a regular hack and slash game in which you can't control the camera angle, similar in feel to Darksiders and DmC. Not incredible, but kills time nonetheless."
,Recommended,249680,29283390,Posted: 15 January,all,"Dr Funfrock, Esq.","Blatent God of War rip-off, with the Greek pantheon replaced by Mesoamerican gods. The story is straight B-movie ""evil dude kidnapped my girlfriend and is unearthing ancient powers to destroy the world"" nonsense. All the very coolest stuff happens in cutscenes, with frozen-in-time pan-around-and-the-scene-changes technique presumably used to stretch their art budget as far as possible. It's actually kind of cool and comic book-y, though the frequent deadpan expressions on hero and bad dudes alike during intense action moments are unintentionally hilarious.The combat is generally ok, though you'd never mistake it for a Sony Santa Monica or Platinum Games product. Use your dodge, mash attack buttons, and you'll generally come out ok. Enemy variety is fairly uninspired. I hope you like squashing bugs and fighting machete-wielding mercs. It gets better in the latter half, with dart-throwing priestesses, giant club-weilding thugs and medusa-clones.Someone on the development team apparently thought they were making a platforming game, because there's far too much of that throughout, including some ""Challenge"" sections where you also tasked with collecting all the glowing things. Definitely the worst aspect of the game.So, worth playing? Sure. Set your expecations at a comfortable medium level, and enjoy the ride."
,Recommended,249680,29513600,Posted: 26 January,all,SigmaX,"Hmmmm what to say about this game..... Well first, this is a soft yes. This was a really strange game. The premise was strange and dialogue was really odd.But I finished it, so that's gotta mean something kept my attention.It's basically a god of war/dante's Inferno game. Some quick time events, which happened so quick, I didn't realise I was supposed to do something.I also hated the ""cut scenes"". I mean it was kinda cool once, but I'm pretty sure I missed a bunch of the story because I accidentally skipped a slow-mo section. They should have allowed me to just skip the slow-mo section and then ask me again if I wanted to skip whatever came after.Riding on enemies and using them to fight was kinda cool, but every time you jumped on the last giant scorpion, they pretty much had to throw out some smaller bugs just to give you something to kill... so I just stopped doing it.And what an odd end credits mini game... frustrating as hell.Anyway, I don't know. I don't feel like I wasted my time with it. So I guess that's good.Oh yes, and the camera was ♥♥♥♥♥♥."

76561198201827598,Recommended,249680,29347317,Posted: 18 January,all,Frostsamurai,"Marlow Briggs is one of those games that refuses to take a moment to catch its breath. There's always something going on, you're always moving on to the next section, no intermissions or results screens.That being said, Marlow Briggs is really, REALLY engaging. In the first 20 minutes, you go through a handful of large areas and beat up more than a dozen enemies with the power of your newly acquired ancient aztec weaponry before fighting the first boss, which suddenly changes the core gameplay from a hack-and-slash to an on-rail shooter.With a bang, you're given a new toy to play with and are sent flying from the boss arena to the next part of the game, where more enemies lie in wait for you to combo to death, along with a variety of slightly clunky platforming and puzzle solving.Rinse and repeat for 6 hours.9/10"

It's one of the best category B-movie out there and an epitome of ""sit back on your couch and enjoy"" games, no difficult fights, no mind twisting puzzles, only action and cutscenes in between. Also, humour is not cringeworthy (99%) which is pretty unique for such category of entertainment.Highly recommend."
