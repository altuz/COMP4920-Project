,Not Recommended,249870,32280748,Posted: 8 June,all,King Link,"I like comics, I like DC comics, and I like scribblenauts.   So this should be a natural fit.It's not.  In fact out of four Scribblenauts games, played on PC, and DS, this is with out a doubt the worst one.  In fact I'd say this is the only one I'd call ""bad.""The problem is this doesn't really isn't a different game than the original games.   There's challenges (that don't work well, such as only ""female characters and adjectives"" what ever that means.  So you can't create a shovel. because it's not a female character.)The thing is a majority of the game is just random ""missions"" but unlike Scribblenauts Unlimited, the missions are actually random.  You just get 5 on the map, maybe a few more.  If you don't like them reset and you get new ones.  You aren't actually forced to do any quests.Each quest will give you points once you have enough points you can unlock a new map, that comes with ONE major challenge, and just a new space for random missions.The real issue I take with this game is the random missions.  The major challenge is the real story of the game and that's mostly about the DC characters.  The random missions though range.  I really don't have anything good to say about them.  A lot of them are fetch quests.  A few are fight quests, and a few are just ""I need to dig a hole""  you attack the hole with a shovel and it's dug.   There's really no link to the DC universe for these missions, even the fight or fetch quest, might refer to a DC character, but most of the time, it's random person asking for random object.It's a real shame, because the DC universe is really vast and this game shows it with it's wealth of possible characters you can name.  The down side, is the game rarely uses that universe, and seems to have under 20 really DC inspired quests, the rest of them are just ... side quests, and because you have to grind on them to get further in the story that's a really big bummer.  It's a shame, because Marvel or DC + Scribblenauts should be an easy marriage.  Lego marvel Superheroes is one of my favorite Lego games, and Lego Batman 2 is  just behind it and almost as good.Scribblenauts Unmasked though doesn't take enough use of the license.  Hell if they just did the level of content and number of missions as Scribblenauts unlimited, I'd probably give this game a thumbs up (Even though that game bored me, I always felt like I was making meaningful progress).  This game doesn't feel like that, instead I feel like I'm just running on a bike to get a little more of what I want, while I slog through very boring gameplay.A shame, but personally, I can't recommend this game.  Go check out Scribblenauts Unlimited if you want to play scribblenauts.  If you want to play with DC characters, both Injustice, and Lego Batman treat them right.  But Scribblenauts Unmasked is not the right game for anyone.  Even as a fan of both franchises, I can't enjoy this game except very superficially.  A shame, because this could have been the best yet."

While Unlimited was good, it ended fairly quickly, and then there was not much else to do other than use the backgrounds and spawn things randomly.Here there is dynamically randomly generated content that goes on endlessly, every time you reload a level there's more things to do, even with variances with the dynamically generated content, the quest giver/target as well as the things being asked change even within the same quest.And to top it all THE MASSIVE ADDITION OF THE DC UNIVERSE!!! All of this together makes for the best Scribblenauts experience I've ever had! 10/10."

76561198068465411,Recommended,249870,20536198,"Posted: 15 January, 2016",all,Egotistical Raven,"Warning: In this review I will be comparing this game to Scribblenauts Unlimited, just for convience and ease of explanation! You have been warned!Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comic Adventure is very different from Scribblenauts Unlimited. Different in their freedom, different in their objects, different in achievements, different in level desgin, and different in their challeneges.In Scribblenauts Unlimited there was unlimited freedom, as it says on the tin. But in Scribblenauts Unmasked there is a big limit, and this limit can inspire even more creativity than Scribblenauts Unlimited. The limit in question is that in each level in each session, you can only use a certain adjective or noun once, and if you continue to use it, points will be deducted. (These points are merely a type of coin system you can use in-game to perchase in-game costumes for your character.) This will force you to come up with a different object to use instead of the one you were going to use, or it will force you to come up with a way to do the same thing you were doing, but without that adjective or noun.Scribblenauts Unmasked is obviously a DC Comics game, and thus you can spawn DC Comic related things, which means that the objects you can spawn are very different from Scribblenauts Unlimited, in that they are actual copyrighted things that are allowed in game. This doesn't just serve as a theme, or as a nice little detail to fanboy about, but also it can serve as another way to challenge you or to give you new ideas. As well as it being DC Comics, you are also allowed to make your character some description of a superhero, or supervillian, when you desgin your own character you can give him/her super powers and a swanky costume that you designed yourself. Of course the super powers are a bit limiting, I will warn you, as they only really involve attacking and nothing like flying or invisibilty, but those can be added after character creation with adjectives or even nouns, such as a flying ring.There are almost double the achievements (Scribblenauts Unlimited 25, Scribblenauts Unmasked 40), as well as adding random (showing up at random) challeneges when you enter a level, which will challenge you to not use adjectives, or only use DC characters, which can be interesting and a lot of fun. Because there is so much to unlock with the points you collect, when you finish everything in the game then you can gather heaps of points and try and buy all the costumes and super powers.The level designs are much different in Scribblenauts Unmasked, as they are a lot darker and grittier. There is also a level path for certain parts of DC comics, such as a Batman path, where at the end you can 'learn' about his backstory, just in case you were so isolated that you don't know.If you are going to buy this game, keep in mind that although it has many positives that Scribblenauts Unlimited didn't have, you will most likely get more playtime out of Scribblenauts Unlimited then this game. But this game has a lot more potential play time then Scribblenauts Unlimited had. And in some ways it is better than Scribblenauts Unlimited,"
,Recommended,249870,16341735,"Posted: 12 June, 2015",all,Skel1,"I recommend it, but only if you're craving more scribblenauts with the understanding that this one just isn't as good.Pros:- Creativity similar to Scribblenauts unlimited. If you can dream it, it's in there- HUGE database of DC universe heros and baddies. Seriously huge. You will learn about comic book heros you've never known existed.- Lots of interactive Lore, the starite missions and the origin missions are a blast!Cons:- Fighting is horrible. It is the same horrible clunky fighting system as in Scribblenauts unlimited but it is used everywhere constantly! It is almost unbearable and is entirely frustrating- Game progression is clunky, new areas are opened up by collecting medals in each respective comic universe.- Did I mention the fighting is terrible? Weapons degrade and disappear faster than they can kill an enemy, yet every time you turn around some random bad guy is attacking either you or the person you're doing a riddle for.Over all? 7/10 if you really liked scribblenauts unlimited. If you never played scribblenauts, 4/10."

,Recommended,249870,7759678,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,damekage,So being my first experience with a scribblenauts game this was an excellent experience for a DC comic book fan. Being able to do thing like grab blue kryptonite to make fighting Bizzaro easier or providing not any old time machine but a time bubble to someone asking for a way to time travel I was really pleased.That being said this games combat is lackluster and at times I did feel kind of limited as to what kind of word combonations I could provide to solve puzzles along with the ease at which you could missclick in combat and make enemies of your allies it could get kind of frustrating at times.That being said the time I put into playing this game was overall enjoyable until my last two achievements but as they have nothing to do with the story it is not that big of a deal.If you are a fan of DC comics I would say it is well worth at least one playthrough.I give it a rating of 7.5/10
,Not Recommended,249870,28460638,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,Bread,"Only play if you're interested in a DC sandbox. The game itself is a big step down from Scribblenauts Unlimited (so, a HUGE step down from the first two Scribblenauts games). No clever puzzles. Very little incentive to be creative. You just grind reputation by completing braindead randomized encounters so you can unlock the next story mission. Then when you're done with that you can grind MORE reputation to unlock the origin stories for the major characters, which take about one minute each to complete. And then you can grind more reputation and unlock costumes if you haven't fallen asleep yet.Despite being very disappointed in this game, I did enjoy its MASSIVE collection of DC characters and items. Sadly there are no Watchmen or Gaiman Sandman characters (or anything from Vertigo). There are, however, hundreds of Green Lanterns, alternate versions of characters (there are like 30 different Batmen), and obscure crap like Arm-Fall-Off-Boy. If you're a comic nerd, it's fun to mess around for a while and just look at all the stuff they put in here. It's too bad the game they built around it is so tedious."
,Not Recommended,249870,33817323,Posted: 26 July,all,Mister Bad Guy,"I quite like the Scribblenauts series, and I quite like DC. The whole concept seemed like an easy A for me, and I was interested in checking out what the game was like. Unfortunately... it just falls short in so many ways that I really can't describe it in any way besides being let down.Performance: If this were an issue in a game as dirt-simple as this, I'd be worried. And fortunately, it isn't. Even when I was spawning up entire franchises, the game ran just fine.Plot/Writing: Scribblenauts games are never going to have much plot, but to its credit, Unmasked at least tries. The story is your basic crossover: Maxwell and his sister get sent to another universe through the magic of arguments, they team up with the heroes, his villain teams up with the villains. The whole thing's a slight step up from the previous games, which had no plot, but now we're on the level of a Saturday morning cartoon, and not even a good one. The villain does get some development, but it's nothing above that of ""he just wanted love."" The game does try to put in the legwork for witty dialogue, but it's too twee to be particularly funny.I do remember one part of the plot: that bit where it's revealed that Maxwell is the reason Barbara Gordon's spine isn't broken anymore. That's canon, folks!Puzzles: Unfortunately, puzzles have taken quite a hit. The only parts of the game that I'd actually call ""puzzles"" are the big missions where you team up with a hero to fight their villain, and there's only a few of those over the course of the game. They're not bad, but it feels limited. You only really fight alongside one member of the core N52 Justice League once each (Superman and Batman get two), plus Robin and Batgirl, plus the final Justice League teamup. It's not like the DCU is low on content to adapt; where's the Justice Society or the Teen Titans or the New Gods or the Legion or any Justice Leaguer outside of the N52 core seven? And the actual puzzles are just fairly generic battles with the hero's respective nemeses rather than anything from their actual stories. It makes the universe feel small and boring, which is exactly what it shouldn't be.Their quality is inconsistent, as well. There's a section where you defend Wayne Manor from armies of ninjas that killed me twice because there were so many enemies onscreen, while I finished the Atlantis stage in under a minute after spawning three objects. Several missions penalize you for taking down an enemy you're supposed to be taking down. That said, the final battle with Brainiac is pretty fun, even if it is a bit finicky.You also have ""origins"", but all they are is ""spawn thing we tell you to."" It is pretty funny to make Clark Kent fly for the first time by giving him a jetpack, but if you're looking for puzzles, you should look elsewhere.No, the real thing you'll be doing for most of the run is the open-world puzzles. Basically, every time you enter a city, there'll be new puzzles for you to solve, each one of which provides you with some currency if you do. These will be what you do for most of the game, to unlock new areas and play their story missions. Then you realize that the reason the game is able to do this is because the puzzles are randomly generated. They just take a template and then play Mad Libs with it. I myself realized it about a half-hour in when a lady asked me for Dan Garrett's autograph.The result is that the puzzles come out as being formulaic (spawn a thing, kill a thing, move a thing, do a thing with a filter over the screen), except for the times when they're impossible, because one person's puzzle made a tyrannosaurus and it ate everyone else in the area before you could get to them.New Mechanics: Here's a place that Unmasked actually improves on its predecessors! The biggest problem of Scribblenauts games is the fact that it's easy to end up using the same tricks over and over, or cheese the game. Give yourself ""Invincible"" and the enemy ""Dead"". Fast Wings and Good Shoggoths for every mission that requires you to fight something. Unmasked finally puts a damper on this a bit by making it so that you can't use the same word twice, or certain words like ""Intangible"" or ""Invulnerable"", without halving your reward for the level. It's not a perfect fix, since the counter resets for every stage so you still end up starting out every level by giving Maxwell Fast Flying Strong, but it's a step in the right direction.The other big mechanic is that randomly, Mr. Mxyzptlk will appear and give you a challenge for the area you're in, which will double your reward for every puzzle you complete under it. It's a fun idea, and it does lead to some interesting challenges, like beating a whole area using just female superheroes or words that begin with N, which are some of the most fun and organic parts of the game. Its weakness is that there are no checks for it, and Mxy frequently makes puzzles in an area flat-out impossible, requiring you to reload it. In a game so heavily designed around random content, you'd think they'd check to see if the random content doesn't do exactly this.You also have superhero costumes which you can unlock, giving you the powers of superheroes. I never bought a single one, because Fast Flying Strong covered most things I needed and i could just spawn the hero in anyway.Finally, the game gives you the power to create your own NPCs. I can't offer much insight on it, but I can say the interface is weird, and the options are a bit restrictive. Maybe it's just me, because the people on the community hub don't seem to have that problem.Overall, not perfect, but there's a base here for later games to follow up on.Use of DC: This is the big selling point of the game, for obvious reasons. Getting an entire eighty-year-old universe, with thousands of characters and stories, is something that a game like Scribblenauts drools over. And on a surface level, Scribblenauts delivers. The wiki lists 2078 characters or objects, which blows any other game out of the water in terms of pure content, even if they do mostly end up being reskinned mannequins of each other. This gave me a lot of options, such as beating the Superman level using just Superman characters, creating dream teams, or setting up fights between six martial artists and the Anti-Monitor. After a while, I started to come up with obscure characters just to see if the game could correctly guess them.But numbers is one thing; depth is another. I noticed this when I made Alan Scott, and I discovered that there's only one Alan Scott in the game - as Sentinel. By a similar token, Green Arrow is only wearing his New 52 outfit. Same with Darkseid, who has no option to get him out of his ugly N52 togs. Bart Allen is there, but not as Impulse. Plenty of characters aren't there at all. Ryan Choi, Sir Ystin, Shilo Norman, Nix Uotan, Kathy Kane, any DC One Million character... I wasn't even really trying with those ones, and yet they aren't there.And you might call this pedantic to expect that obscure characters should be in the game, or that characters should have every costume (and it is). But that's undercut when you search Batman and get greeted by four pages of alternate Batmans. That's forty characters, most of which look identical! How is ""Hush Batman"" any different from the regular variety? And there are dozens of Green Lantern characters who never even got dialogue and made it in! Wesley Dodds holds down a series for 70 issues and he loses out to Kworri? It's not extensive, it's just random.Add that to the generic story and randomized puzzles, and it doesn't feel like a labor of love. It feels like Fifth Cell put in the minimum effort to satisfy their licensors, checked a wiki to churn out some NPCs, and called it a day. I got it on sale for ten bucks, and I guess it's okay for that, but twenty? No chance, unless spawning Thomas Wayne whenever the game calls for a doctor sounds worth it to you."

I'm loving seeing this game help with his reading, typing, spelling as well as his mouse and keyboard skills. We have a rule that if he is playing then he has to think things through and also try to enter the names of items and characters - and it works! Of course I'm also getting a kick of out any hearing the weird or wacky ideas he comes up with that solve the puzzle (as well as dropping a few of my own) and there have been times when we have both laughed quite freely while playing.And yes, I've had a blast playing on the game myself. For obvious reasons this is less likely to appeal to someone without kids and I much prefer playing the game with the young'n but I would not say it cannot be enjoyed by any age group.

No it's not, nor it is the little masterpiece it could have been.The ""create what you want writing it"" thing is cool to some extent; it could easily become boring and, when rapid action is needed, you would probably create something basic just to solve the problem quickly. Otherwise, you would smile two or three times creating absurd things, then the action will become very repetitive. In the end, also language understanding problems by the AI will prevent some of your fantasies to be created in the game.What about the DC Universe? On the one hand, the game has an enormous library containing almost all of the DC characters, the most strange and forgotten ones too. That's cool, but... on the other hand, the narrative is very basic and not only made for chidren, but actually childish and sometimes annoying. So, if the game is made for (quite stupid) children who probably haven't a deep knowldege of the DC comics, why is this enormous fan-service library provided?...who is this game for, exactly?

76561198044219042,Recommended,249870,29045064,Posted: 5 January,all,dinosaurdan1,"Was a fan of Scribblenauts Unlimited, so when I heard they were making a DC themed game, I preordered. Since then, I've played Unmasked many times, and until recently I hadn't played Unlimited in years.Unmasked is hands down the best DC game out there. While it doesn't have every DC Comics character (The Penny Plunder and James Gordon Jr. are two omissions that immediately come to mind), it has most of them. There’s some really obscure characters in here; RUU-9-2, Salamanca, Kritter, Dragon King, etc. You can use the Batcompter to get information on them at anytime, although some of their profiles are a bit odd. (Computo’s entry is clearly about his New 52 version, but the character himself looks like his Pre-52 incarnation)Admittedly, the story mode is a bit on the short side, but it’s enjoyable while it lasts. Everyone is in character and the dialogue is funny.  The choice of main villain is a bit uninspired, but he works as a main antagonist. The levels look amazing, and the backgrounds are extremely detailed.Maxwell has a ton of unlockable costumes based of DC characters that can give him their powers. For example,  the Flash costume increases his speed, the Orange Lantern costume causes the characters you kill to rise from the dead and fight for you, and the Scarecrow costume allows to use fear gas on enemies.One of the main parts of the  game is the Heroic Feats (randomly generated quests) that spawn in the levels (With the exception of the last one , the Batcave, and the Watchtower. These are both a blessing and a curse.My main issue with Scribblenauts Unlimited is that once I had gotten all the Starites, and had helped everyone, I was basically done the game. (There’s the Object Editor, but the Hero Creator in Unmasked is better.) There’s  not really much to do in Unlimited’s  levels once you’ve completed the story except find new ways to kill everyone in sight.Thanks to the Heroic Feats, there’s tons of stuff to do in Unmasked. Ok, so they are kind of repetitive at times, and I must question why a superhero needs to waste his time helping people with arcade games and capturing digital flags. However, there are plenty of situations where you help superheroes and fight super villains. If you bought the game to play superhero, or just mess around, you will have a great time. Heroes will ask you for weapons, ask you for help tracking down a villain, or ask you to join a team of heroes.Often, hilarious situations happen. For example, it’s not uncommon to see a member of the Green Lantern  Corps asking for something to help them fly, or asking for a weapon. You will see villains like the Anti-Monitor mugging people with Christmas lights and fire hoses. There’s sometimes feats like “Make this urinal cake healthier” or “I’ve prepared this lovely ceiling fan, but have nobody to serve it to”. During one feat, I was baffled to see what appeared to be a bank riding in a car. It turns out that Catwoman had dropped the moneybag she was supposed to be stealing, and stole the ENTIRE BANK instead. I sometimes go back and forth between levels for hours just to see  what random things happen.The best and worst part however is that the Heroic Feats are messed up when it comes to spawning. If a hero or villain spawn near  each other, they will fight, no matter what. This can lead to mass destruction, a zombie plague infecting everything, or a massive battle going in the centre of the level. At one point, a hero vs. villain battle was rudely interrupted by a kid’s pet Basilisk falling from a building, landing by them, and turning everyone in the battle to stone. It makes the level feel alive, unlike Unlimited where once you help everyone, everyone just stands around waiting for you to do something.The bad part is that this can get annoying when you actually want to complete the heroic feats without interference. I’ve gotten instant rep when spawning too many times to count because some villain I was supposed to defeat had the bad luck of spawning near Batman. Or an angry villain destroyed the out of control car I was supposed to stop. Other times, I fail a heroic feat before I can even do anything. Several times I’ve spawned right by a car that runs someone over before I can even move my mouse. Or the person I was supposed to escort spawned by an hungry T-rex.The combat is a mix of good and bad as well. It works the same as in the other games, which makes sense. Watching heroes and villains battle is entraining, and sometimes I spend hours pitting characters against each other.But, I can’t help but feel that the combat could have used a revamp. The battles between characters with weapons and powers are the most enjoyable. When it’s a  battle between  ordinary humans, it’s a slap fight. Even if a character has a gun, they will often get as close to the enemy as possible before firing.Other characters are OP when it comes to fights, especially if they have poison powers. Tar Pit is the most OP,  due to being able to poison characters and set them on fire. He’s killed Darkseid, defeated the entire Justice League, and sent the Anti-Monitor in a comma.  He was not this powerful in the comics. There are also characters like “The Superman” or Match who don’t take damage from normal attacks unless you make them weak, or make them “Flaming Explosive”.On the other hand, other characters are underpowered. Captain Cold and several other cold themed villains have a useless gun that does nothing but go “ZOP!”  and freezes people for a millisecond. (Mr. Freeze has a much better gun) The Weather Wizard summons doves with his wand instead of changing the weather.One funny thing about combat is that characters don’t take friendly fire very well. A lot of the more powerful weapons are tough to aim, and you can hit the wrong person by accident. However, the AI considers anyone who hits them as an enemy. Quite often, after summoning the Green Lantern Corps or another team to help with a villain problem, the members would turn on each other in an unstoppable fit of rage.Another good and bad thing about the game is that it is quite buggy. Scribblenauts games have always had glitches. Due to the amount of possible interactions and combinations, it’s impossible for the Developers to  test everything. And with the randomized heroic feats, you are bound to run into plenty of odd things. Like the other Scribblenauts games, the glitches are minor, and won’t normally get in the way.There’s some funny stuff. If you spawn Solomon Grundy, then give him the adjectives “Flaming” and “Explosive”, he’ll fly across the screen in a massive line of explosions. If you are in his path, you end up stuck in a situation where the game thinks are you dead, but you aren’t, so you are stuck in what can only be called limbo. The AI isn’t too smart, leading to citizens killing themselves on dangerous objects like fire, or heroes trying to attack villains with a ceiling or floor in-between them.There are some bad ones though. Sometimes a story mission will just glitch up. You’ll be there but be unable to continue it. There are ways around this of course, but it’s still annoying. There’s  also some bugged characters. Richard Dragon and First Appearance Superboy are stuck in place when they spawn, unable to go in any direction.I personally consider  Unmasked to be the best Scribblenauts game despite its flaws. There’s a lot more things to do then in the other games, the DC characters are well designed (with some exceptions), and there’s more replay value. However, it’s also a bit of a guilty pleasure, as part of the enjoyment comes from the bugs and the ridiculous heroic feats.If you are a DC fan, or like Superhero games you should pick up this game. However, if you want a less crazy game, or are not interested in DC,  Scribblenauts Unlimited would be a better buy."

This game expands that by adding many villians to fight and heroes to help you, all from DC comics. It also makes it a much bigger part of the game by directing you to do it more. Maxwell takes on the role of a superhero, thus having to frequently fight. That's what was so fun to me about this game. I also enjoyed having DC characters in the game.One complaint I have though is that the missions can sometimes repeat themselves. The reason is that Unlimited had a lot of programmed tasks, each unique, but Unmasked generates a set of missions randomly upon entering an area.Also, the game is quite expensive for a Steam game, so it may be a good idea to wait for a sale. Given that it's relatiively casual and quite short, (It takes around 10 hours to get every acheivement) that is what I reccommend doing."

Adding to the large dictionary the previous iterations had to offer, the developers add almost every DC character- an impressive acomplishment. You can still screw around in a sandbox world, just like in the previous games, writing anything. The only problem is that your sandbox doesn't save your progress when you exit, however, which can be annoying since there is already the manual option for resetting.A (somewhat) new feature was the hero creator. In short, it's Scribblenauts Unlimited's object editor in which you could edit any existing object, but with the ability to add super powers. Additionally, Unmasked introduced a combat system. Right clicking would activate your built in powers, or otherwise, a punch from your character. If you add more than one ability, it's kind of inconsistant on which ability will appear. Often times, my heat rays will shoot everything, and my green lantern punches were nowhere to be found. The superpowers are neat, but they feel difficult to use.Something I should also point out is that the charming Scribblenauts music from the previous games did not return. It was a bit depressing not to hear the familiar songs, but eventually you don't bother to really care about the music anyway.The puzzles in this game felt like a combination between the first Scribblenauts puzzles with Unlimited's puzzles. They aren't perfect though. After about two hours, you'll find the same recurring puzzles, which makes you want to stay in the sandbox batcave. The biggest problem though, is that sometimes, I could enter a world, let my character stand there, and immediately, somehow automatically get an achievement. You'll soon take notice that it's due to the puzzle givers intertwining paths, killing each other because ""Heroes V.S. Villains"". I understand the developers had put effort into keeping all the puzzle givers into one world, but it didn't end up working.Even though Scribblenauts may be losing its color, it's still a very unique game. Fighting with/against the DC characters in their adventures makes you want to read the comics.  In some ways, Scribblenauts Unmasked excelled in areas its predecessors could not handle. In other ways, this game went back some steps. Despite all this, it won't stop me from continuing to beat up Batman with my bare fists."

The game ruined me from enjoying the others, though. This was my first Scribblenauts game. I bought it because I saw Smosh play it. xDI suggest you start off from a different one, unless you're a big DC fan like myself. However, it seems like people who start from Scribblenauts Unlimited tend to not like this one. I am an example of someone who started playing Scribblenauts with this game, and I don't enjoy the others as much.The customization, sadly, is flawed. When trying to create an avatar (You can do this for free, which is friggin' awesome! xD), you'll often find that you aren't able to move Maxwell's bum. The only thing you can do is color it black, shrink it, then cover it with the bum you want. Actually, shrinking it messes up the animations, so one can only cover it with the desired bum. (xD Bum!) It would be nice if one could move it, too. Plus, it's difficult to make custom weapons. There's no way to make one shoot lasers from scratch. I've tried beams, but it shoots out arched metal beams. I've tried laser, but the laser gun comes out. It becomes a laser gun that shoots laser guns out. I have, however, made a mod of one that can shoot laser, but I simply colored the laser gun black, shrank it, then covered it over, much like Maxwell's bum. xDSadly, when I tried changing the laser's color, I lost its ability to shoot lasers. I tried the laser thing again, but it wouldn't work. It was only shooting laser guns out. <.>This caused me to have to redo it from scratch. (Not really. As I said, you can't really make one from scrath.)I uploaded my final result to Steam's Workshop. You can try it out if you'd like.Seriously, though... THis game needs some updates.On the bright side, I bought this game for $40, and I don't regret it. I know a lot more about DC Comics' Superheros now, thanks to this game. If you don't like it for its game play, it's like a comic book database. Plus, Smosh played it! xDBecause of them, I always give Batman a warm toilet seat, or voice act when I'm bored. It's pretty nice.(Allowing multiple savegames would've been nice, too. I've had to delete my save game again and again just to experience the story mode again. Plus, to experience it again once the game is finished, one has to go through the chapters, which are not in order. It's bothersome. That is why I just delete my save game and start over instead.)I recommend it! In all seriousness, I hope the people who made this game see this review. We need updates! Please!"

Puzzles are randomly selected, meaning on more than one occasion I have been given the same puzzle to complete, and the game seems to want to trick you into thinking that the game isn't linear by showing you multiple worlds from the map screen you can't unlock until you've solved enough puzzles.

For those new to the Scribblenauts franchise, essentially each game has you play as the lead Maxwell, who goes about solving problems and helping others by creating practically anything using his magical notebook, meaning that a mundane task of say knocking over a pile of bottles can be done with a more typical throw of a ball or perhaps by the use of something unorthodox like the shot of a battleship. In a nutshell, every Scribblenauts game uses this formula of requiring the player to creatively and often hilariously use their own preferred means of problem-solving a variety of different scenarios that warrant different kinds of thinking - which is awesome! This basically means that you can play and progress the way you want to, which feels rewarding for the player since it is because of your own imagination and thinking that got you past that particular level.Now, Scribblenauts Unmasked retains this same mentality, but admittedly pigeon-holds it. How Unmasked differentiates itself from the other games in the franchise is its introduction of DC-related items. As you can probably already assume from the screenshots and titlecard, Unmasked's story (without trying to give away too much) involves Maxwell helping out in the DC Universe. To anyone vaguely interested in DC, this concept sounds extremely great on paper, but in execution, it was a bit lackluster. Certainly, it was great to see familiar faces like Batman and Superman, to be introduced to more obscure characters, and to utilize both DC heroes and their gadgets to solve puzzles. However, the puzzles, or ""Heroic Feats,"" that we are supposed to solve are all extremely similar. They almost always involve you either destroying/killing something/someone, finding something for someone and returning it, or delivering stuff in some shape or form. Any other puzzles are unmemorable or are too easy to be worthy of any mention. Because of the similarity in all the puzzles, you end up just using the same methods of solving them, making optional puzzles something more of a chore/point farm than something I do out of just genuine interest. As well, there was little to no theming done for any of the locations. In Scribblenauts Unlimited, in each place you visited, e.g. the hospital, firehouse, art museum, etc., there were missions related or made sense in the context of each respective location, which helped with theming and immersion. I sadly found little of this in Unmasked. The optional Heroic Feats scattered around each location, and even the story missions specific to each location, were so similar that nothing really separated each location apart, aside from obvious things like aesthetics. What was frustrating was how the game put you into a position where you had to farm these optional puzzles, because unlocking other worlds required you to spend points, hence the puzzles being, as already mentioned, now a chore. It didn't even feel that fulfilling to unlock a new location for all you really did was do the exact same puzzles.Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to paint Scribblenauts Unmasked as a bad game, because it isn't. Despite these flaws, it's still fun and a feel-good experience, but it's definitely the weakest title released within the Scribblenauts franchise. If I could, I would give perhaps a sideways thumb, for I want to both recommend this game and not recommend this game, but to particular groups of people. I would only recommend Unmasked to specific demographics, namely to children/parents looking to buy their kid a light-hearted and fun game, fans or players who have already enjoyed other Scribblenauts games, and achievement hunters. Scribblenauts games are all easy to pick up and play and are games which can easily be enjoyed by all members of a family, which is why I'd recommend it to the former. For those already familiar with the series, while there are certainly those aforementioned flaws, Scribblenauts Unmasked retains enough of the original Scribblenauts formula to keep fans interested. And as for the latter, the achievements for this game are relatively easy - you should have both the story fully complete as well as unlock all the achievements within 6-8 hours. The demographic I wouldn't recommend this game too are those using this game as their entry into the Scribblenauts experience. In other words, if you are new to the Scribblenauts series, you should avoid this title as your first Scribblenauts game, because although Unmasked is still pretty fun, it doesn't do the franchise complete justice - try Scribblenauts Unlimited first. Whether or not you like Unlimited will help you in determining whether or not you'll like this game, because if you end up disliking Unlimited, you'll definitely be disliking Unmasked. I would also advise anyone and everyone looking to buy this game to get it on sale, for while it is still fun - it isn't up to par with the previous titles, and the whole game feels like it's just an expansion for Unlimited.Condensed review: Scribblenauts Unmasked is a fun game for any aged and kind of gamer, but is riddled with a number of glaring flaws that hinder it from being as great as the earlier released Scribblenauts game; Scribblenauts Unlimited. Grab it on sale, or get Scribblenauts Unlimited instead if new to the series."

He was able to help with the challenges and we had a great experience playing it together. As we finished up Scribblenauts Unlimited he was excited about playing Scribblenauts Unmasked.If you're like me and played the first game with a young kid, I do not recommend this game. Many challenges start with your character being attacked before you even know what is going on, other challenges have confusing failure states where you will knock out or freeze a villain and the challenge will be failed or you will scare a villain and when he runs away he'll scare other characters and break another challenge. It's a mess and it is not for someone who is playing with a kid or wants to take their time to think up solutions.If the hero action that disrupted the puzzle challenges was fun, I might still recommend this game for adults, but it is a mess. Characters fly around bumping into each other, attacks frequently harm bystanders, and heroes often behave like drunks at a tough man competition just punching away even if they have powers. I don't really know who this game would appeal to except maybe people who just want to see what DC characters would look like as Scribblenauts characters.Definitely do not buy, even on sale."

While this version might be shorter than Unlimited your mileage may vary depending on how much you explore.  Unmasked also introduces unlockables which can be bought with credits starites earned helping people.Now for the negative.  In this version when you spawn into an area all the tasks and characters in the level you help are automatically generated.  This can sometimes cause chaos when it begins with contradictory items with even some goals completing themself.  Some find this RNG element boring and repetitive as it takes away the unique feeling and creative design in every mission from the previous Scribblenauts but it is a trade off for replayability with new scenarios each time.

The gameplay was repetitive at some points as I had to do the same heroic feats many times to get enough reputation to get through the whole story, which was the main negative for me in this game. I was looking the most forward to having the gameplay been approved from Scribblenauts : Unlimited, but it got worser in my opinion. The game overall was great because it was saved by its storyline, as it was interesting and long with many interactions with the DC heroes. Also, I enjoyed the bonus unlockables where background info was shown through stories of the main DC heroes. The game gived out another great moral, like all games should have and it was shown in the ""tearful"" ending animation where the main lesson of the whole story was that you should always forgive others even if they caused so much trouble to you for a long time because you will eventually see that they have feeling to.GG, 5th Cell and Warners Bros., hoping for a next installment to Scribblenauts coming to PC in the near future.-8/10"

The DC universe adds to the potental of the creativity. And having different puzzles each time you load into a level also adds potental. But dispite having more potental then predicesors I would have to say if your going to pick up a Sciblenauts game that Scibblenauts Unlimited is a much more enjoyable game because while the puzzles are the same every time, having a smaller pool of puzzles allowed for more interesting mechanics to the puzzles, Unmaked puzzles just don't feel as thought out.  And because of that I unfortinitly can not  recommend this game. Its fun, it has more items then Unlimited, but between this and Unlimited, Unlimited is a much better purchase. In either case both are better on PC then any console both because of having an actual keyboard to type, but because Steamworks adds a lot more items into the game that the console versions don't get, so though games like the Wii/WiiU versions have more items built in like Mario characters, but with Steamworks you can get those items anyways with someone having created them.Good game, pick it up if you played Unlimited all the way through and wanted more puzzles to solve, but otherwise pickup Unlimited instead."

I tried this multiple times and still could not get the game to proceed ergo making it impossible to finish the game.I was looking foreward to playing this game for a long time so I'm very disappointed. While a compatability issue is possible, if it can happen to me it can happen to others.In short, buy at your own risk.UPDATE/WARNING:Do not use a custom avatar before completing the main storyline.I think it may have had something to do with using a custom avatar before completing the main storyline as the problem started soon after creating one. I cleared all the data and was able to finish the game after doing so. Still, it shouldn't have happned in the first place.With that aside I'll say it's a decent game otherwise."

I think it would be great for kids just learning how to read (as long as they stay away from browser history, I think that is a very good thing).  This game is meant for super-hero fan boys, and you know they type! Let me explain… let’s say you take a HUGE crap and then shape it into the bat-symbol & clam it to be a chocolate bar… A fan boy would buy it for an excessive amount of money and after taking a bite would clam it to be the best chocolate bar of all time without critical thought.CON:-Every level forces you to replay it.  They are so small and honestly not that fun the first time you play it.  How small… You can transverse the level in less than 50 seconds and see everything each worlds has to offer.- Puzzles seem to be more repetitive than fun.  The game feels like work.- Levels tend to be so lame that even you’re in-game sister will interrupt your “free-romming,” every 5 seconds to annoy the you by asking you to leave a map, because even she thinks this game sucks.  She is like that girl you know that will not stop talking but has nothing relevant to say.  She also makes me think this game is sexist.- Game tends to use a lot of Zombification as game mechanic and it makes it more frustrating than fun.- Combat is so terrible. You have to face the character your hitting, so if you use a keyboard to move.  Even then your allies get in the way and if you accidently hit them 1 freaken time they go Bat-SHHIT-CRAZY and attack you.  You will be like… Dude I just stood still and your literally ran into my fist.- There is no grey view of ethics of justice.   If you spawn Catwomen, she is considered to be a villain and will be attacked by heroes.- They left Static Shock out of the game…  I assume it is because this game is full of sterotypes that make it Rasist, Sexist, and Homophobic.  Including one of the original created black superhero might be controversial… Sorry I think Feminist Frequency has brain-washed me into caring about such things… What is with feminist and Plaid shirts…Seriously, do you think they are like, “Hey this looks terrible, now people will take me seriously”.- You cannot play as 60s Robin from that Adam West Days.  That guy had some serious bulges in his shorts.PRO-	Making random strangers get “pregnant” out of no-where.-	They have all my favorite obscure characters that you do not hear about too often. (Suicide Squad, Green Arrow, Deadman, the Question, PowerGirl Owlman and Plastic Man).-	The game even manages to include different versions of every character excluding Nazi Superman, which is probably a good thing.PERSONALLY-	The game just too small, too short, and too easy.  This is the definition of a cash grab because it is low quality crap.TIPSYou can use adjectives like FAST/Speedy & STRONG to get through the game quicker.WHEN you accidently hit a dumbass allies: Use the adjective “Peaceful OR Happy.”  My preference is to just kill the F@#$ and then respond someone cooler.Use your Keyboard to move; otherwise you are more likely to hit allies.It is a good thing that Fan-boys love chocolate (I sell a special one of a kind batman chocolate so send me money!!!!)You can make your own hero costumes.  I like playing as the Ambiguously Gay Duo."

But it's not very good, either.One of the new things they advertise that this game comes with is a random mission generator. The idea of this is there's supposed to be an infinite number of missions, but in truth, there are only, like, 12, each with slight variations -- despite what the devs think, simply replacing ""Item A"" with ""Item B"" only rarely causes an actual change a mission.Beyond that, most of the missions are based on combat and other action-y things. If you've played any previous Scribblenauts games, you'd know why this is a bad thing - Scribblenaut's is at it's funnest when you're allowed to let your imagination run free, but that's not really an option when it comes to fighting -- it just comes down to ""Summon a new weapon or superhero, wait till either you kill them or the weapon/hero breaks, rinse and repeat.""The story's not that great, either. Granted, I wasn't expecting it to be great, but if you're buying this because you think the DC influence will lead to an interesting and engaging story-line, well, then this will disappoint.Now, this game does have its cool parts. The fact that it makes you constantly come up with new items in a mission is a cool idea. The special conditions that rarely apply when you approach a new area is a cool feature.But overall, this game is not very good, and if you want a fun Scribblenauts game, I'd recommend the infinitely more polished and well done Scribblenauts Unlimited."

What this game is a Scribblenauts and DC Universe mashup that contains both heroes, villains, and Maxwell & Lilly (The protaganists of Scribblenauts) all in one game.The story is Maxwell and Lilly travelling to the DC universe after losing the starites that allowed them to get there in the first place, but the villains have claimed them as their own and are using to them to benefit themselves. You have your story missions that take you five minutes to complete in which you create roughly three things and the conversations take over the entire duration of a mission. All missions are not unlocked up front, you have to get reputation to purchase areas for you to explore, but this is a poorly executed idea.The quests are extremely repetative & it bored me out of my mind by doing the same thing over and over again just so I could progress with the story. The person who thought that you shouldn't be able to use the same two words in the same area needs to be FIRED. This just toys with the experience and it doesn't take long before you rip out your hair trying to think of a new word for dead.You can also purchase costumes that add ♥♥♥♥-all to the game & origin missio...FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKES. Stop with the origins! The movies, the video games (most, anyway) just are trying to tack on entertainment value but they cost alot of reputation and after 30 minutes of playing you really begin to wonder what you are doing with your life and just want to give up and start your life again in China.If you are new to the series, just do yourself a favor and buy Scribblenauts: Unlimited. That game was alot more fun to play with and it doesn't get repeative to a such a quick extent as Unmasked does. Not saying that this game is completely awful, but it just doesn't seem worthy as Unlimited was."

,Not Recommended,249870,34248166,Posted: 14 August,all,Reckless James,"I'm a huge fan of Scribblenauts Unlimited, and a huge fan of DC Comics..... here are my thoughts.Pros:- A vast amount of DC content, very very impressive and great!- The same type of gameplay you'd expect in a Scribblenauts game.- The levels are very beautiful and detailed!- Story is simple and basic, but that's okay as you don't need a crazy story in a game like this. It works fine!Cons:- You must speak to Alfred whenever you want to access edited characters. I liked it in Unlimited where you can access them at any time. What were they thinking?- You cant access custom objects on the database either. So either you remember ALL the names of EVERYTHING you download or keep literally everything in your bag (or utility belt, as it's called now).- All. Custom. Content. Is in. The Batcave. Only. Seriously.... who thought this was a good idea? Remember I mentioned Alfred? THAT'S why..... again, you can ONLY access edited characters through him and him alone. Did the developers become braindead after they made Unlimited? Unlimited was perfect the way it was, why did they mess all this up?- The bag was glitchy in the last game and items would disappear if you added too many, and did they fix it? NOPE! Same issue here... except, as mentioned previously, you NEED to have this working if you want all your custom content (or remember every single name, goodluck).- Not all powers are available to use for creation. I noticed I can't add simple laser vision to a custom Superman if I chose to make one, instead it comes out of his hands. Lame. What's the point?- The game is very crashy, Unlimited wasn't like this. Didn't they test this game before they released it?- Missions aren't as varied in this game, way too many repeats and not as clever as the ones in Unlimited.Overall, the cons outweigh the pros..... therefore I would ONLY recommend this game if you are a really hardcore fan of either DC and/or Scribblenauts.  But if not, don't waste your money on this.  Worst of all.... none of these things were ever fixed and they never will be because this is a children's game. Why bother refining/patching a dumb children's game amirite? What a waste..."

The vocabulary library provided barely tug at my imaginations, my carefully crafted words often goes unrecognized by the game's limited understanding of how things should diverge as I see no reason why a marshmellow laser porcupine starship shouldn't be a thing.Words aside, I'll still be plenty happy if the game was well made. The controls were horrible and unresponsive, there is a slight moment's pause after each command, lending to my frustrations.There are no merits I can wholeheartedly give the game and with every second I see the game's title on my purchased games list, my heart aches with regrets and humility."

While the game does kinda deliver on the DC part with a load of characters, it seems to have gone at the cost of anything else. There wasn't much of a desire to toy around in this game, since using regular objects on DC characters feels kinda flat, in fact, I think I saw less regular objects than the last game, but I could be wrong on that. The missions of sorts seem cool at first, helping heroes fight their respective villains, but it feels very linear and forced, with the actual solutions being so specific that I was forced to go for the straightforward boring options. This game also seems to have more of a story, but it just feels like a bad fanfic and is an excuse to have way too many unskippable exposition cutscenes. I completely lost interest after playing Metropolis for a bit. If you are a big fan of either Scribblenauts or DC you might want to check this out for yourself, but for anyone else this is a definite skip. Get Scribblenauts Unlimited if you like the concept."

It's not so much the setting, as the DC universe freshens things up and actually gives the game a focus and plot. However, the reality is that the combat focus on much of the game makes this a bit less enjoyable, particularly when adjectives don't work the way you think they should.It's Scribblenauts, so it's fun, but it's definitely not a full-price game unless you're a comic junkie. Yes, the superhero specific puzzles are definitely beatable without too much lore-specific knowledge, but at the same time, you're probably not going to have the same ""OOOH!"" factor as a comic book afficionado.On sale, this is a no brainer, particularly if you're a Scribblenauts fan.

The game is about a kid with a magic note book and his sister trying to get home, inorder to do so they must help DC's superheros over come villains aided by someone with the same powers as yourself.I bought this rather than the first game since it's set in the DCU, so I can't compare it to the original. I picked this up on a steam sale, which is where I recommend you buy it.Pros: simple lighthearted fun, plenty of material and details for DC fans, the ability to mess with things like your mr mxyzptlkCons: poor mouse controls, grinding to pad out the game,  overly scripted boss fights, occasional glitches/bugsThe drawbacks to this game are that the mouse is sluggish, this can be a problem when you're trying to click items in the game. This is not a game breaker by any means, and the game is easy anyway, but its an annoyance when you first start the game. Another problem is that new missions are unlocked by in game points rather than beating prequesite missions meaning that you may have to grind them with sidequests late game. The side missions are really where the game shines because you can get creative and/or fail them without consequence Boss fights mostly feel like their holding your hand and telling you exactly what to do which can be annoying since you want to get creative. I undersand this is for kids, but a higher difficuluty for adults would be appreciated. I've found one mission where the game doesn't give you back control unless you mash enter and/or space, reading the forums alot of other people also have this problem.All and all I would recommend buying it, though for me it's not worth $30 US(that said I'm on a budget so decide for yourself if you want to pay full price) It's a neat little game that rewards creativity and experimentation. Despite it's flaws the game is definitely worth checking out."

It is, but I didn't realize how little I knew about DC comics and their superheroes/villains before I played this game, and it really took away a lot of the fun - you end up creating the same few heroes you know again and again. Admittedly there's a huge encyclopedia included in-game that lets you look up every single included hero or villain, but it's just not as much fun if you're not deeply into DC comics to begin with. Aside from that, while the superhero thing is worked into the Scribblenauts universe nicely, it's just not as much fun coming up with creative solutions when most of the time, creating a giant Superman will solve things anyway. So, it's still a fun game, but I only recommend it if you're a big Justice League fan or DC comics reader."

The style and art direction are fantastic! The characterisation of the DC roster is generally solid, if understandably 2D. It feels like the kind of simplicistic presentation that comes from love of the source material. In that sense, it could be seen as a less successful cousin to the LEGO games. The interface doesn't particularly lend itself to a PC, clearly being designed with a touchscreen in mind, but this only creates the smallest of irritations. The game is suitably slow-paced, so it never becomes genuinely problematic. A fun game, if lacking in depth."

For me, this game is worth it for the enjoyment of seeing all these characters in one place alone, but that's not all this game has going for it.This scribblenauts game is different from the others because of the new approach it takes towards gameplay. The game encourages continued creativity throughout levels by reducing the rewards you receive from repeated use of them in an area. And while it doesn't punish you for not having a large vocabulary, you won't be able to 100% this game by reusing the same dozen words in every level. You'll even be penalized for certain word choices (i.e. Invincible) if only some of DC's writers were held to the same standard.Another change is the combat in this game. I often felt that the fighting in other scribblenauts games was a clumsy mess, which often lead to me opting for the non-violent solution. No more will you be forced to join the pacifist ranks with the likes of that vegetarian Gandhi. You'll be able to cross swords with the best of them.

At the time you'd get a car, a rope, and a basket and solve every puzzle ever. Scribblenauts Unmasked ups the ante by sending you into the DC comic world of Superman, Batman and all the other super heroes you didn't know.The game consists of a series of puzzles in the form of distressed NPC's who need your help with their troubles. Instead of getting the star out of a tree, you're now trying to get the entire red lantarn corps out of a fortified tree hut by conjuring a different lantern corps of your own. Or you're trying to help superman overcome his nemesis Lex Luthor by giving Supes a lead armour and replacing Luthor's laser cannons with water pistols. Everything is doing overly simplistic and rather adorable, but it gets old quite fast.The big, narrative driven puzzles are amusing, but you need to unlock them by collecting enough points of a certain currency. This gets tedious fast because the payout is actually quite low and the controls are a bit iffy. You'll be grinding your way though menial tasks like giving musicians they instruments or by curing sick bear cubs of the flu. What you want to be doing is summoning 17 different versions of Superman and letting them duke it out over a sandwich.Still, it is a funny little game, but I cannot reccomend it at it's regular price point. Get it in a sale, and have a few laughs."

I luckily bought it on sale for 5$ and I'm happy I did. I would not recommend buying it for more since you only get a few hours of gameplay out of it and there is not really any replayability value.

The camera movement. Previously you use the right mouse click to move, now u just move the mouse to the corner of the screen to move it while they replace the right mouse click with Attack. Is it better this way? Well in my opinion, no. Previously u hv the feeling of control of the scene u see but now u feel like dragging the camera around and feels sluggish.Oh and also u hv all the DC Universe characters in it. So yea. Should've stat this first but then again, the camera viewing really irritates me. Maybe its just me, I dunno. The game works like all the other games in its franchise, but implimented with DC related characters in the story.So is it bad or is it good? Well, depends if u r off two things.One, if u r a DC fanTwo, if u r a Scribblenauts fan.If u r both, great! Get it. If ur a DC fan, u will be amazed how many characters u can make in this game, its just mind blowing. If ur a Scribblenauts fan like me, well I think u can pretty much skip this or wait for it to be on sale. Its exactly like all the other Scribblenauts games, but shorter and seemingly easier in my opinion since I played a few before.This is not a bad game, but as a Scribblenauts fan, I really wish it could be a teenie-tiny bit longer.7/10"

The main story is about two hours with another four hours or so of content to 100% complete-Grinding reputation to get all costumes and achievements is very repetetive.I 100% completed this game in 8 hours over two days and I would say i had fun for most of that time. I enjoyed the story mode and the side missions were fun until I had done each one 30+ times. One major gripe i have about the grinding for costumes was about 60% of the costumes were locked behind the green lantern faction with the remaining 40% split between batman and superman areas. It would have been good to split them up evenly or maybe add more factions."

I spend a lot of time just pulling up characters like the GL Corps and the Legion and then making them fight the Anti-monitor or Flash's Rogues.  It's a mess to watch, but I find it fun.The Cons:-There's not much to do post-story.  Unlock costumes, earn Steam achievements...and that's about it.  Each level is randomly generated with tasks each time you warp there, and I found that a lot of tasks repeated.  The previous games had set levels (1-1, 1-2, etc) that you could beat in multiple ways, and I would have prefered this to the bigger levels with multiple tasks.  Plus, they had the challenge mode where you had to play a level three times, each time coming up with a different solution.  That would have greatly extended replayability.-Maybe I'm just not creative enough, but I really couldn't figure out some of these tasks.  I didn't notice if there was a hint system, but I definitely could have used it.  Sometimes I would just warp out of a location because I couldn't figure out a task.-Some reactions between characters were fun, but the game could have used more considering they were playing with all of DC.  Spawn Lois Lane and Superman or Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale and they get hearts over their heads, but spawn Thomas and Martha Wayne right in front of Batman and...nothing.  The origin missions could have used more branching, too.  Maybe multiple endings for each origin based on things you did (like spawn a lizard instead of a bat when young Bruce falls into the cave and you get LIZARDMAN!).  Again, it would have extended replayability to have multiple endings to these origins, and for continuity's sake you could always say the origin was an Elseworlds tale.I know I had more cons than pros, but I really did enjoy this game.  Definitely pick it up, it's always on sale on Steam."

When it finally came out, I was amazed.I used to sit and play the original so much.Then came the next game where they added Adjectives.I was amazed even more, all the combinations.Then the third game, which added the ability to make your own items.Even more mind-blown.Then this game, which is still really good, the story is short but lets face it we don't do the story we just make 99999999999999999999999999999999 giant fast purple invincible dragons, right?"

The levels are a pain to get around in, and some of them outright require flying, which is just annoying to have to reenable over and over again. The puzzles themselves really just seems overly repetitive, and it didn't feel like there was as much creativity involved in them.In the first, areas could be cleared, whereas here there's a boss fight (these were rarely terribly interesting) but every time you visit a level it will be filled with a new set of randomly selected puzzles. It meant that I didn't really feel like it had the neat theming that was present in the first game. It also meant that having to clear out these smaller puzzles just felt repetitive and uninteresting.Finally, the superhero element, while neat in some situations, largely just meant that there was a whole bunch of repetitively high powered foes and at a certain point, it just became frustating enough that my solution to every indication of violence was ""Green lantern corps"", which would bring in like 10 heroes at once. At least that made the achievement for 150 green lantern members happen faster.The game should feel fun, and it just really, didn't."

However, it's also fairly decent as a DC game, if you're into that kind of game. It has qutie a collection of available DC characters, pretty much any one you can think of. Even down to specific incarnations of the character. And if there's a character you want that isn't in the game, well...make it yourself. Or see if somebody else has. The game has workshop support, after all. The story's not exactly the best story that's ever been wrote, but, it is super-hero game directed at kids. I'd reccomend giving it a try if you like DC games and creating your own things. Though, after a while, the game DOES start to feel kind of...stale. Everything begins to become ""Been there, done that."""

Brushing up on obscure DC trivia is icing on the cake. The only real thing wrong with it is that some of the random adventures don't make a lot of sense due to how the randomization works. I also found the extra level challenges to be, while fun, completely extrataneous. I hope if there is a next game, it will not have those.Presenting the only version of the DC universe that doesn't make me have an urge to slap the writers is more than enough reason to buy, own and play this game. The humor is just what an ex-comics fan needs to consider removing the ex part, even if it is only for a minute.  Sadly, it was only for a minute, thus the 9/10 rating."

,Recommended,249870,34199063,Posted: 12 August,all,CircusTiger3000,"I just beat the main story mode a few minutes ago. Although this game had some flaws, overall, it was far better than I expected.Let's start with the cons: There were some gameplay mechanics that I found annoying. Most notably, Lily's messages. When there are new missions in a different area from where you are, a big message pops up on screen, without warning, and disrupting gameplay. What's worse is that sometimes I accidentally clicked on one of the buttons on the message, because I was about to click on something in the place I was currently at, booting me out of the area I was in, in the middle of a mission. The worst was one time when I was in Atlantis and about to fight Orca and some other baddies, only to get whisked away just because Lily's message popped up when I was about to click to attack Orca.There were also some frustrating segments where I had a general idea of what object the game wanted me to create, but I didn't know which exact word to use, eventually forcing me to exit the game to look up the solution on the internet when I had the right idea, it's just that the game would only accept certain words that I didn't think of.There were some specific moments in the Starite missions that were also aggravating. The Aquaman mission started with no intro cutscene, so I had absolutely no idea what to do without looking it up online. In the Wonder Woman mission, at one point you're asked to give Wonder Woman a trident so she can fight a Kraken. I gave her the trident (and a bunch of other weapons), but she didn't do anything. I had to grab the trident from her and fight the Kraken myself.If you can look past those things, however, I would strongly recommend this game. The graphics are beautiful, resembling a cross between the artstyles of Scribblenauts and a comic book. The soundtrack is also great, although I wish there was a sound test or something where I could listen to each song.Although the story wasn't exactly complex or unpredictable, it was pretty good. I thought this was just going to be a normal Scribblenauts game with DC characters shoehorned in, but the game does give us a pretty entertaining story about Maxwell, Lily, and Doppelganger entering the world of DC and interacting with each character. I especially like how Doppelganger is finally given more personality than simply ""bad guy"". The ending was really nice too.What's also impressive is the sheer amount of DC characters and objects found in the game, along with nearly every single object and adjective from previous Scribblenauts games. 5th Cell clearly did some research, and it payed off!The Hero and Avatar creators are a lot of fun to use, despite being difficult at times (the hardest thing is attaching parts to the body the way you want them), and offer players a lot of freedom for customization.Although the main story mode went by really quickly (mainly because of Lily's annoying messages), the character creators, ""backstory"" levels, and reputation missions add a lot of replay value. I just wish I could replay the Starite missions.In general, although Scribblenauts Unlimited is still my favorite game in the series, because of its simple yet cute story and loads of levels (I have the 3DS version of that game, though, so I haven't gotten to try the Object Editor in that game), this game is a close second for me. I think there's so much more they could have done with this game's concept, but for what it promises, it's pretty good. I wouldn't mind a sequel, though..."

I already beat the game on my 3DS where the 'edit' feature is completely absent, so that's the only reason i got this. While yes, i also had unlimited, unlimited is a lot more fun. This game just has SO MUCH WRONG WITH IT. The weapon durabilities, the lack of being able to use one item multiple times. You having to make your own character things on PC. (If you're on 3ds, ♥♥♥♥ you, you have to play as maxwell). And, while yes they are old, unlimited has memes. You know, the ancient grandparents of today's memes, nyan cat and such.

I personally out of all the scribblenauts games enjoy this one the most. thousands of dc characters, lots of puzzles and tons of creativity. Honestly, it's one of the best games i've played in a couple years since skryim and shadow of mordor.Pros- Puzzles, puzzles, PUZZLES!!! Tons of replay value, hours of replay value.- Tons of DC Characters, close to all of them- stays true for dc fans and scribblenauts fans (I'm both)- Character creation system to make your own characters and also (optional) release them to steam!- Fun missions / story mode- Graphics / style- Variety of actions- Different iconic places such as metropolis and gotham city.- TONS OF SUITS TO BUY AND USE!- Balance of fun and difficulty- EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAME!!!!Cons- Can't hook up your own controller which is kinda a bummer, but it's fine.-  Difficult targeting certain objects at times, but dosen't bother me mostly- There is this guy name mxyzptlk that randomly pops up to give you challenges in worlds, but it sometimes makes it impossible to do a challenge, such as only allowing you to make words with the letter d, when there are some puzzles and task that make it impossible to such a huge restriction, but its up to you to accept it, its a choice.- This is just me, but I did wish there was a test room like the older scribblenauts, but I just use the batcave and clear it out.HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT!!!!!! Just at least give it a try, you probably won't regret it."
