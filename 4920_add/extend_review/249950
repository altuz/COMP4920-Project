Upon playing it, however, I learned that the two games are in fact very different. This is a game for RPG lovers who are up for a fun challenge. There are lots of things to do, and I find myself constantly hoping for new gear with which to upgrade my current gear. Is this a fun game? Oh, absolutely. Are it's bugs game breaking? Not in the slightest. At least, none that I've come across *knocks on wood* I only wish that armor equiped shows up on your character."

More Early Access games need to be like this.  Granted there is not a lot to this game just grind away at the mobs and get to the boss and more than liekely he will be bugged and just stand there while you kill him but again there is potential.

Due to the fact that it's still in development the storyline isn't much still but it's still fun to just play and go around hacking and slashing, exploring, and looting what there is to loot. I will say that it's extremely fun to play if you have a friend to play with (Not that it isn't fun to play by yourself) whether you're actually playing through the game to finish the story or to just goof around and have a fun time. I recommend this game to anyone that has an interest in dungeon crawlers or voxel games and that just like to play games with action and/or adventure in them."

Beaten the first difficulty and loved every second of it.Great story. I was fascinated, I laughed and even nearly cried in the end. This game has a high replay-ability due to the random generated world, (as far as I read) no Hero level cap und lots of loot, many skills and cool abilities.Story: 9  / 10 - had to take a point .. wish the story was a bit longerGameplay: 9 / 10 - just one word .. loot! lots of it!Interface: 7 / 10  - it's okay, but a faster way to sell items (like CTRL+Mouseclick on the item) would have been nice. The Menu is not really pretty, but it works.Sound: 8 / 10 - a bit awkward that fire traps have the same sound as spike traps ... should have taken the soundfile from the flame turret.Music:  -   can't really tell .. have the music muted in 90% of the games due to haveing my own music running.My conclusion:Absolutely worth the money.

,Not Recommended,249950,16215059,"Posted: 5 June, 2015",all,TheSpeedOfRound,"Pretty dissapointed, and confused as to why the review here are so positive. I bought this game with a friend to enjoy a simple dungeon crawler, but it really failed to meet my already low expectations. Here are a few of the problems I found with this game:Too easy. Probably the biggest issue was that it was never a challenge once you get a couple levels up. Bigger issue is that it dosnt seem to be balanced for multiplater at all, so the same amount of MOBS split between two people makes it twice as easy.Not enough divercity. In each dungeon there is 3 or 4 enemy types that you will kill over and over. There all the same brain dead ""move to player and attack"" AI, nothing really changes the game up to much. I've seen worse mob assortment, but in a game where all you do is grind, it becomes really tiresome.Equipment has the same issues as well, theres a few different types of armor and weapon, but you'll stick to one and use it and it's hight stat varients for basically the entire game.The dungeon puzzles are all the same drawn out push rocks around ala pokemon and do nothing other than pad the games play time.Over all this game was a very boring and stale experience. Only play it if you've never really played a dungeon crawler before and your tastes are pretty simple, and even then it's not really worth the $17 price tag."

Inventory size is 500, and you have to handle each item individually. For example, allow selection of all items of a specific rarity, either for selling or merging into other items at the workbench. That would greatly reduce how long I spend in town.* No destruction of terrain, despite being a voxel based game. (Whats the point of making everything out of tiny blocks if they're not going to change? I.e. get destroyed by me and/or big monsters)* Limited spec options** 6 proper class trees and 3 general archetype trees** Shallow spec trees. most only have 6 abilities, 3 levels each.* Normal mode, which is required before any other difficulty, is a joke that will nearly put you to sleep if you've ever played any other video games* Buggy:** Issues running ForgeQuest without windows 7 compatibility on Windows 10** Issues using steam to take screenshots (screenshots are simply green blobs)** Issues using steam to stream the game (same as screenshots, green screensreen)** Game crashes when 2nd player of a coop game joins from the tutorial dungeonOverall, I recommend the game on the caveat that you can get it working!

,Recommended,249950,28922149,Posted: 1 January,all,Crunchy Gremlin,this is an intresting game.i think with a few years work it could be really really good.

Check it out when you get a chance and give the learning curve a little time.
,Recommended,249950,16102995,"Posted: 31 May, 2015",all,Taxes,"This game is a great deal of fun if you like the voxel art style and Diablo-like play. Just so there's no confusion, though.. it looks a bit like Minecraft but that's just a stylistic choice. There's no in-game building.Probably my favorite part is the loot system. All loot is meaningful (except for maybe potions, but that's a personal choice that I don't use them very often). This is because you're constantly upgrading your gear by combining unwanted pieces of gear with the stuff you want to use, leveling it as you go. There's also a huge variety of runes you can socket into your gear for better stats.I'm big into co-op multiplayer games, and this one is a lot of fun with a few friends. I started playing in Early Access, and i was pleasantly surprised to find that multiplayer runs nearly flawless, which is a rarity. Most of the Early Access multiplayer games I've played lately have had very buggy networking code.That said, I am a bit disappointed this game has gone to full release. While the game itself is finished and the game play is superb, it is very, very buggy and the developers have not worked out enough of the kinks in my mind to really call this a finished game. I play with 3 other friends online, and one had a lot of issues just getting the game to run without crashing, UI disappearing, weird stuff like that. All of us have encountered game breaking bugs like hard crashes and controls locking up. I originally wanted to play on Linux but for some reason couldn't even get it started (Ubuntu 15.04), I had to run it on my Win7 machine instead.So if you can't handle a bit of flakiness from the game, you might want to hold off on buying for a little while. On the other hand, the devs have been very responsive (check the forums) and are constantly pushing patches. But even that's kind of a mixed blessing as they frequently break as many things as they fix.On the whole though, I am very satisfied with the game and hope that it only improves from here on out!"

Please understand this game have a in-game button that can increase the difficulty with; 50%, 75%, 100%, 150% and 200%.Here's what I like about the game:- Runs smoothly- INFINITY LEVELS. No levelcap.- You can reset talents, choose whatever talent you want. There's no ""You can't choose that, because you're a mage!"" ect. You are not stuck with your classes abillities, you can simply just learn other abillities if you want to.- This game is hard. Don't believe me? Then go ahead and set the difficulty to 200% increase, and beat the game on Hard, Expert or Master. I promise, you will die.- Really great story. Pretty sad though, in a weird-funny way.- The music is pretty chill, I like it.- You can add runes to your gear, upgrade them to more powerful ones.- If your gear doesn't have a rune slot that you need, you can simply take the gear piece and craft it with the gems you've found in the candy-crush alike minigame you've harvested, and add a rune slot to your gear.- Pets- Skins- Your own personal loot, friends can't steal the loot from you. (Which is soooo great).- Lots, and I mean A LOT of loot. You'll be swimming in loot. Not too much, not too few either.- Not all chests have loot. Some of them contains chickens.Things that I dislike:- When playing with friends, you can not always revive them.- Sometimes when you die, (Which happens rarely) you can stuck in a death-animation and have to force-exit the game.- No public games you can join :[- Would be great with more doungens.What I would love to see in the future:- More doungens.- Maybe some sort of 'raids', which is pretty much extremely large dougens, way more mobs, and really hard bosses with many mechanics and abillities. The current bosses have very few, except for cluckins. But more mechanics is always fun.- A more open world.- That you're able to play after the ending. I want to know more about the story, even after the ending.- Live-servers with other people would be pretty nice. Unrealistic, but nice."
76561198009746319,Recommended,249950,16886997,"Posted: 4 July, 2015",all,Sanguinary,"So far, my impressions of this game are pretty good.TL:DRPros:Good itemization with potential for end-game grind/achievementDiverse skill-tree with flexibility to pick skills from multiple sub-categoriesHas small puzzles/mini-games to break up levelsHas a specific art-style that may appeal to someAllows for some clothing customization, potential for moreLots of inventory space. Lots, it's great (and you get a stash, but not a shared stash)Has a sense of humourParty play! Works well, even with latency, group buffs for everyone!Pets, have your own follower, each with their own unique abilitiy to complement youSkill reset is possible! It's got a price-tag, but if you think you screwed up you can undo itHaven't encountered many bugs (2 to be exact), so it's good to see them being patched/fixedCons:Re-playability may be an issue for some, it has a game+ sort of mode, but only the same 4 dungeons (which are big)May be confusing to begin for people not familiar with RPG/Dungeon Crawl gameplayDifficulty scaling may need work, at this point I can't vouch for higher difficultiesGame black-screens when you close the window, this persists through windowed and fullscreen mode (game runs in the background, but you can't see to click or rectifiy)Newer players may struggle to understand the scaling resource cost, it isn't properly reflected in skill cost descriptionsPets are currently lack-luster in terms of damage/functionalitySkill bar slots are quite limited, it's not possible to cycle to a second skill bar or use F-keys etc.It comes across as a voxel-based game with similarities to games like Torchlight, with references to quite a few things (the more obvious ones being things like Zelda, which was cool and somewhat nostalgic).I personally found it very easy to pick up and learn, with most things being quite intuitive and any issues I had, I could check the in-game help/guide. That said, I had to explain a few concepts to people I got to play, the big one being socketing (the only confusion I had was seeing the rarity and mixing it up with the socket colour), I'm not entirely sure how this could be streamlined, perhaps a small image in the guide with arrows.Itemization seems good, as of posting this I've only cleared normal and started intermediate on one character (plus a few others close to clearing normal), I've found that it has potential to go quite far, with the inevitable grind for the perfect socket combinations, unique drop of the item you want, etc. This is of course fine, assuming that the challenge remains present. In my current iteration, I've found that with enough gear refines and appropriate sockets, even without building defensively at all, there's no threat from monsters or traps. This of course may change in higher difficulties, but there should still be some kind of progression.In terms of progression, I found the first dungeon and a half scales pretty linearly, then there was a gear spike where sockets and refines became more viable, new skills unlocked and suddenly what was a pain to deal with (healing wolf packs with resistance) became easy, this is completely okay, as long as there comes another stage of difficulty.Anyway, going on, skill selections are good, being able to cross-class your trees is great. Want to be a rogue with some magical prowess? No problems. Want to be a barbarian with sentry guns for backup? You can do that! I think that's a good thing, it allows build diversity. Could lead to further itemization with +skill level on a rune or added flavour on weapons/armour. I found it slightly perplexing being able to progress down one side of the tree, but then unable to come from the final skill back to the top layer (in order to skil a skill I don't want), you can only go up the tree, I guess.Resource costs for skills might seem steep at first, but this becomes more logical (and requires further investment into gear) at higher levels. Currently there's quite a few weapon choices, although more would always be welcome. Certain base items won't start dropping until specific stages of the game. By the end of the first playthrough, you should have seen most/all of them.I like that there's higher difficulties, where you can keep your character, but I feel the endless dungeon mode (rng maps, map mods, possibly with influence) which I think I saw mentioned somewhere would be a good improvement for later gameplay, especially if new areas could be introduced (or new monsters).Party difficulty scaling is great, while not everyone will welcome it, it stops the game feeling too easy with group-orientated skills. Did I mention there's a support sub-class? Group-buffs? No? Well I should have!Specific skills may be over-tuned, while it's great having that really high cost ultimate ability that deals loaaads of damage at max rank, it's not so great if it one-shots the boss.Pets. Cool feature, feels lack-luster. There's room here for much more. More pets, more utility for them, longer durations? Give them an auto-attack or make them collect gold. In their current iteration they deal pitiful amounts of damage. This may be due to a level discrepancy (i.e. pet lv.25 vs monster lv.31) but I found that they weren't useful. By making the cooldown more powerful, people might be incentivised to build around pets. Potential to have all pets summoned at once? (could lead to screen clutter, especially in group-play) would make using pet-runes viable.Skill bar is somewhat limiited, which forces you to choose your skills carefully (that's good), but having pets also require a skill bar slot, to properly use, so do consumables. Health potions are pointless, almost, the only reason I found to use them was if I had no other means of healing early-game (or I face-tanked traps later on). I feel a second skill bar would be greatly beneficial, it would allow for more diversity with skills, quality of life with pets/potions/town scroll, etc.A skill-reset is possible, that's great, unfortunately it might also make new characters somewhat obselete. The only real difference in making a new character is the starting gear and which of the 3 base classes you use as a start-point. The rest is purely cosmetic (which you can override) or can be changed in a few skill-points.Lastly, mobility skills. There's only one. Leap. Mobility skills are sort of a quality-of-life thing, not having to run 200 steps in the wrong direction to get back to that one item is a nice QoL, admittedly that could be seen as reducing the life-span of the game, but there's still that same element of back-tracking and exploration without that. One mobility-orientated skill (Dash doesn't count) would be nice for each class (not all, rather 1 per base/sub-class in total, i.e. mage gets a short-range teleport, rogue gets a vanish trick).Anyway, I'm sure there's stuff I missed, but that's my (fairly detailed) impression. I like this game and I'd recommend it, I've given copies to a couple of my friends and it's pretty fun to play in groups. I hope to see more challenge/replayability in the future. I'd probably give it a 7.5/10. That's comparing games in it's genre from established publishers with a lot more financial backing. It's a bit more niche than Diablo or something like that, but it's a good game, it's got potential to be pushed into something that can be played for hundreds of hours, it's just not quite there yet. Is it worth the price-tag? Maybe not for everyone, but if you've played (and enjoyed, hopefully) the likes of games like Torchlight, or just like the genre, give it a go."

It's clearly in Early Access, and it needs local multiplayer and better online before I'd recommend it entirely. However, the reason I recommend it is because the devs clearly are working hard on it, and making it better all the time. They also jump on the forums to answer questions, help stuck players, and sometimes even just chat about the game.

,Not Recommended,249950,14138528,"Posted: 23 January, 2015",all,K!netic,"It's a formulaic ARPG. You pick up weapons, level up when killing monsters, fight bosses, and collect gold. It has an item fusion system where items can be fused together to create higher-level versions of the same item (if you've played Warframe, it's like that).The voxel engine is refreshing - it beats the tired ""pixel game"" style currently in vogue. But there's no environmental destruction or creation. Or, really, *any* destruction that can't be found in a normal game. There's also practically no detail to the game, so it feels pointless to use a voxel render (if it even IS a voxel renderer) for this.And worst, the game is just repetative. There's ten levels to the first dungeon. Every enemy requires 6-20 hits with your sword to beat, and magic is laughably crippled (mana regen is nearly nonexistant, and spells have very low DPS compared to regular attacks). The pacing is awkward and uneven, leading to difficulty cliffs before you find a specific item that allows you to get over them. There doesn't seem to be a death penalty, so more than once I found myself intentionally dying just to get full health. Running back down the dungeon took less time than running out, healing in town, and coming back.The humor is nice, but the lack of gameplay options, uninteresting visuals, and generic gameplay just don't make me want to come back to it. Which is a shame, since it's clear that it's very polished (in the sense that it's smooth, has full-featured content, doesn't have glitches, and won't crash) and has a lot of work put into it."

I can dissesmble a high ranking piece of gear for the reciepe, but then I can only craft a lower gear, which is fine.. but, the only way to upgrade the gear.. is with kits, that can be found in the dungeons (not so frequently either). Crafting dust is too abundant.. and if you harvest ore (by playing a game of jewel quest.. without the chain combos).. after loading a game again in the same place or even exiting the dungeon you will have all tapped out ore ready to be havested again.

But in this game, especially so. Learning how to play is fairly straight-forward, but learning how to efficiently play your character is another story. The class system is very unique in this game, as you are not restricted to playing one class, you can hybrid your class points into different class trees to reflect your preferred play-style. In addition - your class' starting gear does not reflect the gear they are restricted to. There are no gear restrictions (at the time of this review), but different kinds of gear reflects the statistics and bonuses it will give. So if you are playing a caster-esque character, but you want to be more built to take more damage, then the gear you will be looking for is Spellplate. Or if you're playing a ranged-damage character, you will be looking for Scalemail, and so on and so forth. Progression in this game is in the form of different quests that unlock different stages of the game, which inherently give you more gold that you can spend to upgrade your items (up to 10 additional levels past it's original level), make gear purchases, purchase potions, teleport scrolls, costumes, or combat-pets. The puzzles are pretty simplistic and don't take much time away from your gameplay outside of a handful later on that slowly begin to become more challenging and require some thought. The game progresses in difficulty, as one would expect, and the game becomes more challenging with unique boss fight mechanics that will keep (especially Hardcore characters) players on their toes. To wrap it all up, the game has a slight sense of humor added into it, which makes for a very enjoyable game.Cons:> Very limited replayability> No way to restore a previously, or accidentally deleted character> No way to interchange player perspective (more of a personal opinion)> You must always replay the tutorial on a new character> Two gamemodes, story and endless (personal opinion there should be more to do, considering the story mode's replayability is relatively nonexistent)All in all Forge Quest is an amazing game, I highly recommend it to anybody, as you can get a lot of enjoyment and fun out of it, however, like all games it has it's kinks, but - I would rate this game a 9/10."

Being in early access stages it does need some improvements.Pros so far:- Interesting skill trees- Fast pace fighting- Upgrading items is conceptually fair and interesting- Decently attractive story- Customizing your character is completely up to you (Multi Tree Specing)- Combat system is classic and greatCons so far:- Far FAR too easy to start. Need to be able to change difficulty early on. What if people dont feel like playing through the entire game again just to get the ""hard"" part...- Need more epic loots!- Need epic loots to be more EPIC!- Maybe add more content to dungeons? I know it's hack n slash and what not, but something to make it different.- Maybe have a less linear world. Allow the player to make choices. Not just a straight line.- No quests? Maybe something more than just the story line.Great start to what can be a great game. The ""minecrafty"" graphics to the game remind me how content is more important than visuals. I'm sure the developers have everything under control.Put on wishlist if you don't want early access. This will be an awesome game."

That being said, I have about 2 hours of play so far and have enjoyed every minute of it.  Forge Quest takes many aspects of games I grew up loving and puts a nice spin on them.  The combat system is simple enough that you can pick it up and run with it while not feeling like you are just button mashing to win, i.e. any Dynasty Warriors game.There are plenty of classes to chose from in the game and you can use skills from each tree as you see fit once you unlock them without being tied to a single class for the whole playthrough.I still have yet to dabble with the multiplayer so I can not yet comment on that.In the end, it is a $10 game and you will get way more enjoyment out of it than what you will have to spend.  I would  recommend this to anyone who is a fan of dungeon crawling or who grew up playing the Super Nintendo era action rpg games."

,Recommended,249950,8061181,"Posted: 15 December, 2013",all,Hamsnatcher,Good Game in the making. Lots of potential with some kinks still to work out.
,Not Recommended,249950,18185516,"Posted: 25 September, 2015",all,JDP,"Forge Quest was a game that caught my attention immediately with the visual style it works with, so when I caught the game on sale I was pretty happy to finally sit down and play it. What I ended up getting was both what I expected, and not entirely what I hoped for.The best way I can describe the game is sort of a weird mixture of The Legend of Zelda, and Diablo. You'll run around swinging a sword at things, or shooting a bow all the while pushing blocks around to unlock a door. The story is very simplistic, and won't exactly grab your attention but it provides some amusing moments. Unfortunately the story is also quite short, and doesn't really feel like much is made in the way of progression along the way. True, there are skills you can unlock via skill trees when leveling up, but I rarely actually felt as if I was significantly more powerful after leveling. Perhaps you could argue that the enemies become bullet shields, but even the most basic of enemies eventually took quite a few hits after a while. You can get better equipment, but at the time I was playing there was a bug where most things would always drop as a level 1 item. This has since been fixed.The game is randomly generated each time you start a new story (and you'll have to do it at least five times to unlock all the difficulty levels, if you have the patience for it. Ten times if you also want the achievements for hardcore mode) and this is both a positive and a negative. The good is that in a game with not a lot keeping you playing from a story standpoint the scenery is at least different. The bad is that the RNG is not always smart. An example is I ran into at least two instances where I went downstairs in a dungeon to find myself on a platform I couldn't get off of. Seemingly, this RNG is meant to make use of the leap attack ability, which is a talent point issued ability, but if you didn't happen to have that skill you're a bit screwed. Luckily, on both occassions I was able to merely glitch through the edge of the platform to get down to a different area to progress.  An additional RNG annoyance is the special enemies that can sometimes spawn. I had a couple of instances where I'd get a version of a monster that was immune to physical and magical attacks, whom also regenerated his health. Surely you're thinking I could just shoot him with a bow. Normally, you'd be right, but he also spawned adds at an alarmingly quick rate that made actually getting the arrow to hit the enemy I want rather difficult. This is in no way game breaking as these RNG enemies can be ignored at the loss of their exp and item drops, but still it wouldn't hurt the game to be a bit smarter in what can generate and what shouldn't mix when generating.The game is unfortunately also a bit buggy, and prone to crashing. I had an issue where an entire dungeon would cause the game to crash to desktop every single time I attempted to pick a locked door. Thankfully, they have since patched that bug. It, however, wasn't the only issue I had with crashing. I've had it crash in mid battle. I've had the map glitch out on me randomly making it so I couldn't see where I was going, which usually resulted in a crash. The game still feels as if it should be in early access, despite the fact I believe it no longer is. I hate having to say negative things like that, as the developers are very active in the forums for the game and try to fix bugs as quickly as possible, but as of right now when I write this the game isn't fully THERE yet.It may be before long, and I honestly hope it keeps evolving into something great. Sadly, right now I can't recommend it. The game is certainly playable, but it won't likely keep your interest past a first run of the story, and even if it can the bugs and odd RNG may cause you to shy away. Try the game if you think it looked interesting as I did, just be aware the product is a bit rough around the edges before you buy."

The story is actually pretty good and heart warming. Graphics are pretty good and the combat is very smooth and even difficult on easy mode. Mobs will swarm you so that makes you think about strategies and how you approach your enemy. The game has a borderlands loot system along with skyrim upgrades feel. The Looting WGBPO system in Borderlands is in. The skyrim upgrade feel when you combine equipment together and improve it's stats so it can never be outdated. Getting a shield is also highly recommended it's a good stalling tool because shields void ALL damage but has a limited health counter. This was well worth the buy considering it is discounted.

There is a great story to follow within the game with a lot of humor even for the older gamer like myself. Lots of different mobs to try out your new looted weapons on then folllow that up with some epic boss battles inwhich you hope your forged armor you made is strong enough to keep you alive.Tons of loot to collect while making your way through the dungeons. With commomon, uncommon, Magic and Rare items to collect. And lots and lots of gold so you can go buy that all important dog to fight by your side.This is a top down game much like the Diablo series. This works really well although you currently can not move the camera which I would like to see in future updates. Yes there may be some bugs and glitches here and there but for a Beta this feels like it has a lot of promise. If you have friends with the game why not team up to take on mobs and bosses.I hope the dev team will carry on updating this game and making it better and better.

The game is blocky, but there is no digging, block gathering, or sleeping at night!Quick Rundown:  You start the game and can customize your look to some extent, ie dwarf, elf, human, wolf, kobold, male, female, colors etc.  You then get to choose your starting gear.  Feel free to take whatever looks cool because there are no classes in this game.  All skills are open to all characters.  For example I have a warrior that has magic shields and can heal others.  Both abilities are in the ""Mage"" skill tree but they lend themselves to melee heroes very well!You enter the game to find yourself in a dungeon tutorial that lasts all of 2-3 minutes, easy stuff here ladies and gents!  The storyline after the tutorial is amusing and fun but rather weak. In all honesty the game doesn't need much story as it is an exploration and action game.  You will spend most of your time looking for gems and loots!  And there is an immense amount of LOOTS! The gems are used at workbenches to socket items and to upgrade your weapons and armor with various magical and nonmagical abilities.  The trash items you collect can be crafted and combined with your ""good"" items to imbue them with higher levels and new properties.I thoroughly enjoy playing this game with my kids and wife and have no problem with boredom or it getting old.  There are modes of endless dungeons for leveling purposes or there is a story mode.  Multiplayer is fun and can be challenging but it is fun to see different character builds and each team of 4 is immensely different depending on the unique abilities and play styles of the players involved.Controls       10/10 Mouse/KB , Xbox, twin stick, or single stick controllers are supported!Graphics      7/10 Voxel but charming and fun.Sound          8/10 No complaints.  Anime type battle sounds.Gameplay    9/10 Hack n Slash, Multiple kinds of magic, pets, multiplayer coop, endless loot!Replayability 10/10 Each game is randomly generated.  You have options to reset world or keep it!This game has a very classic feel to it, much like if Gauntlet and Zelda were mashed up and spiced with a little Torchlight II.  This game probably isn't for the serious gamer but for casual gamers or younger crowd this game is golden!

The randomized dungeons are a nice touch and the art style is cute, but combat is so frustrating at points that it makes me want to throw my laptop. Like I said, controls are so sticky that it's hard to get used to, and they're often slow to respond which makes combat even harder than it is (which is saying something, the combat can be nigh impossible at times with how damage is balanced currently.) With time I think this game could be good, and the devs seem active, so that's hopeful.If you can get past the sluggish attack system, this is worth the $15. Power attacks are the only thing worth using in combat, but let your enemies gang up on you with so much ease that it can be frustrating, but that's the only big gripe I have at the moment."

The dungeons do feel a bit samey, though there's promise as it is still early access.

The story line isn't finished, however me and my cousin managed to play 6 hours of Co-Op before reaching the end. Afterwhich we are replaying it with the same characters, but on a harder difficulty!ProsThe gear management is nice and simple. It can, however, be quite difficult to reroll stats to what you want.The class trees are simple and streamlined, however due to the lack of a hard level cap, you can spec into everything. Although we both reached level 25 before the end, which allowed us to get all the skill points we needed (There are 3 trees for each archtype (Warrior/Mage/Thief).Co-Op is nice. The EXP is shared, and you each get your own loot. I'm not 100% sure if the mobs scale at all, but it was still fun.The mini-games are fun, but can get annoying after the 50th time your playing the resource minigame, but meh it was alright - something new to do. I feel like they should change the minigames difficulty, or at least its UI, depending on the area your in.ConsA few bugs. I had a bug where i'd get teleported to a different area of the map when going through the transition screens (On Co-Op).There were a few disconnections on either side during Co-Op. It wasn't that bad, however we'd lose items we had recently picked up. I'd say, within the 6 hours we played, we only had 3 D/Cs between us.The range of monsters are limited. Apart from the bosses, which were AMAZING, the amount of mobs were quite limited.

You ahve been warned.If you've read my previous reviews, you'll see that I generally go by the ""50 cent rule"".  I want to enjoy a game for 50 cents per hour.  Thus, a $50 game should give me 100 hours of play time.This game cost me $7.  It took exactly 14 hours to play.  This is a win.Forge Quest is a dungeon crawler similar to Diablo, but with the ""cutesy"" voxel/8-bit looking graphics (just look at the screen shots).  At no point does the game try to take itself very seriously.  There are a few good tongue in cheek jokes, but I won't spoil those for you as the game is fairly short.It starts with you as a new want-to-be hero who has to complete the 4 training dungeons to become one in the eyes of the law.  Each dungeon is only 4 ""levels"" deep, but the levels are fairly large, and the pacing is pretty decent.  New creatures/monsters/dungeon designs pop up just as you start to get bored with the old ones.  The algorithms for generating these dungeons randomly is pretty impressive, as each dungeon ""type"" is completely different from the previous.After completing the 4 dungeons, you'll fight the boss.  For me, the whole process took 14 hours, but I can say I enjoyed all 14 of them.  For the price, it was well worth it.My only complaint would be that some of the abilities are not particularly well balanced.  As a mage, I was able to max out my ""chicken attack"" fairly early in the game (by the second dungeon).  After that, the whole game was just far too easy.  Spamming the chickens would wipe out ANY group of mobs.  Even the bosses stood no chance against my chickens' wrath.  It's also possible that there is a glitch with the chicken attack, as it seems like any attack done not using them had a CHANCE to drop some loot, but every mob killed by the chickens dropped TONS of loot.  Even summoned skeletons and baby spiders.  I had crazy powerful gear by the second dungeon because of this.I also ran into a glitched side ""quest"" that couldn't be completed, but it wasn't game breaking.This feels a lot like a first attempt by an indy dev who now has an engine that they could do a LOT with, but this game itself only had 4 dungeons, and maybe 4 side ""quests"".  The bulk of my 14 hours was spent just grinding my way through the dungeons.For $7, it's well worth it though, and you'll get quite a few chuckles on your way through.  For what the game consists of right now, that 14 hours is just about the right amount of time, and it's unlikely I'll be going for another play through, even with the randomized dungeons.I do hope to see more from this developer, though.  The game FEELS very good, and very solid.  The engine is a treat to look at, and the humor is enjoyable.  I hope to see a much larger, much more involved game created with this engine in the future."

It tells a good story, and makes you want to delve deeper into the game. When I got the game within the first few months it came out it would crash almost every half hour, but years later when I picked it back up it was updated and would never crash  and every floor was different than before. There is slightly hidden dialogue, and pretty funny conversations and messages in the game."
