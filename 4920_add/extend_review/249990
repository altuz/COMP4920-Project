It's miserable.That said, I absolutely recommend this game for co-op with 3 or 4 players.  This game is a very tough gauntlet-style game, with puzzley elements frequently thrown in.  Yes, you are smacking monsters and trying to stay alive, while doing puzzles at the same time.  It's freaking hard.But, it is very satisfying to complete the levels.The only downside is that the netcode still isn't rock solid.  For whatever reason, I have a 20%ish game freeze rate when trying to start a group game, requiring me to totally shut down the game and restart.  Other than that, it seems ok."
,Recommended,249990,7746902,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Redthirst,"Forced is a co-op tactical arena game. It can be compared to games like Diablo, but it's not another Diablo clone - there's no loot in this game and its more co-op than any Diablo-like games I played.In this game you play as slave gladiator who is forced to fight to amuse god-like creatures. Thus this game is based around Trials - rather small arena-like challenges. They can vary from ""kill everyone"" kind of thing to puzzles, mazes and boss battles.You have 4 classes(or to be more precise - 4 weapons) - Volcanic Hammer(AoE melee damage), Frost Shield(Tank), Spirit Blades(Single target melee damage), Storm Bow(Ranged damage) (Each of them have skills to heal each other). In each trial you can get a maximum of 3 crystals (1 for the completion of the trial, 1 for challenge(these will vary from trial to trial) and 1 for time attack). These crystals will unlock new skills(you have a total of 8 active and 8 passive skills for each weapon with only 6 slots(3 for active and 3 for passive)). Also note that your progress is shared among all weapons, so you will get all skills for all weapons simultaneously,Another thing is Spirit Mentor(named Balfus) who is one of the key features of the game. Balfus is your way of interacting with environment and is vital to every trial. To spice things up, you can't just order him to go somewhere. Instead, you can only call him on your current position, which makes everything a bit harder.And about the difficulty - this game is hard. Like, really hard. Not once have I found myself stuck and not once did I go back to gather some more crystals.As a closing note - this game is heavily co-op oriented and I don't know how good it plays in single player. So it will be better if you have some friends to play with.As a downside of this game I can say about quite unstable net code, but devs are constantly working on it."

Extremely difficult, we've spent over an hour on certain trials (still not done with all of them), especially difficult if you want to do the challenges. Controls work great on a controller, gameplay is overall interesting. The orb idea is a neat one, makes for fun and interesting puzzles, although you might kill your friends over it at certain times. You WILL have to go back and revisit previous levels to do the challenges, which provide the upgrade gems for abilities. I personally like this, challenges are usually fun and they really need teamwork, but I imagine it may bother some people playing the same levels over and over.Plays best if you have friends over, you really need to communicate (yell, actually). The main reason why you really need friends for this. Everyone should have a mic and lots of patience, really difficult to have this with strangers.Got a 4 pack in sale a while back, money well spent. We're at roughly 23 hours so far and still has a lot to offer, so I'm pretty sure you would be happy with it even at full price."

No other game has permitted me to talk at such loud levels to the people sitting next to me.It's a lot like gauntlent but a greater challenge in my opinion.  Where as gauntlent is more geared toward grinding mobs down, this is more for how well can you work together on a particular goal.  I haven't encountered many games that make you have to be this tightly coordinated.  Weak links will become apparent and quick.  Each level brings a new way of having to making a plan.  Each monster has to be learned how to be dealt with.  Kiting isn't an option.  Understanding how each fighter operates is vital.My warnings:  This is meant for co-op.  You can play single player, but you aren't going to have as much fun.  More importantly, you will want to find a consistant person or so to play with, which I know isn't always easy.  Pugging this game usually ends in a bad result, and there aren't enough people in the lobby to make games happen when you have time to play.  Also, I would not say this is for a casual gamer.  If you haven't built up a reasonable degree of twitch, I feel you are just going to get frustrated.  I'm not saying people can't learn, but I've seen people that don't play a lot of games say this is not for them.Games are fun, but to me this one was an experience.  One I could share with some good friends."
76561198043519844,Recommended,249990,8431981,"Posted: 30 December, 2013",all,live4truths,"FORCEDis a Action Role-Playing Game heavily pushing a co-op experience.STORYI would say the weakest part of the game, other than some of the technical issues that some people still experience (see technical) - would be the story. It's a very quick and short tale that leaves a lot to the imagination. I'm not saying it's bad; simply shallow. If  your goal is to find a rich story - you will not find it here.ELEMENTSAll players have the option to play one of four classes which are determined in the entrance room to each trial room. It is also good to note that no matter the decision of the class; in most cases you will have healing spells, damage spells, and defensive spells of some kind. Other than the inherit differences between melee and ranged; the developers have done a good job at keeping most everything balanced. The true co-op experience comes into play before anyone even enters a trial; deciding who will have which spell to counter the trial mechanics. This is an element that most co-op games don't have.GAMEPLAYOnce your skills and class has been chosen - per challenge - you will face 25 trials with increasing difficulty. As one may expect the game starts out in a tutorial manner, teaching players how to navigate the trial and use new mechanics. Balfus (your spirit guide) is an integral part of the gameplay, requiring players to move him to destroy shrines or statues, light the path, assist in damage dealing, or in some trials - used against you!The primary game play is to complete objectives which range from killing monsters, finding the end of a maze, or simply lighting shrines. As a side note I wouldn't say this is necessarily a game with heavy puzzle elements; however there is a degree of puzzle solving.DIFFICULTYIf you plan on being a completionist, to get all 75 crystals and all achievements, expect to spend some time on this game. At the time of this writing I have completed all achievements in roughly 24 hours of gameplay. Most challenges took my team 1-10 tries; the challenge on the last boss took us roughly 4 hours. If you plan on simply completing the trials to have the experience to play - expect at best half of that. I would not recommend this game if you want to just play single player - this is a game best experienced with friends. Disclaimer: Your mileage my vary, every gamer and team is different you could see significantly less or more gameplay.TECHNICALI have to peck at the game a bit on this level; there are still a few issues with networking that the developers are actively working on. In addition the game is poorly optimized in terms of graphics use. A lot of the options to effectively reduce load on a computers GPU is non-existant. My system with a GTX570 runs this game fine, but quite hot in comparison to other games with a much higher expectation (100% load in some areas running 70c+). I assume as the game matures further, the developers will continue solving some of the technical issues that some players are reporting as problems; they did not effect my team as much as some but it is important to note that they could come up.CONCLUSIONHighly recommended for any CO-OP experience. This game is quite fun with a lot of potential for growth in the future. 9/10 for what it is, and for my experience."
,Recommended,249990,13113795,"Posted: 27 November, 2014",all,Holysword,"IMPORTANT NOTICE: This is not really an RPG game in most of its sense; there is no actual character sheet, and when your character evolves, whatever choice you make in that regard can be undone freely. Changing your build is literally like changing clothes. There is no looting or potions. There is no choice of gear other than the 4 basic sets, which are also your ""class"", and once again, you can freely swap.This is nothing like Diablo (in this sense) unlike other reviewers insist to claim. Bear that in mind.Devilishly challenging yet fair, this here is a masterpiece.You are simply FORCED to undergo challenges in a twisted sort of arena. Endlessly spawning monsters chasing you while you try to solve a maze, or while you run away from a deadly red myst, or perhaps while you try to take cover from a laser beams (lol what?! its magic!)... figuring out how to solve each area is one thing, solving it is ANOTHER THING!Completion of each area is required to access its respective boss, and each completion awards you with one crystal - literally one ""experience point"" - that unlock skills. Optionally you can solve an area while doing a special challenge (depends on the area) or while time-attacking, each of which award you another crystal. Whereas you might think ""Nah, I'm not an achievement hunter, I just wanna finish the game"" you might be FORCED(unexpected pun)to change your mind there as sometimes the higher level skills give you a crucial advantage when fighting the boss.There is no difficulty tweak, you cannot switch to ""easy mode"". Definitely not for people who get frustrated easily."

It’s a smartly designed cooperative action game with a great variety in its challenges, and a great combat system that encourages teamwork over all else.Forced is an honest cooperative RPG with some good ideas suitable for 3 or 4 players but a hard nut to crack for lone wolves.Playing solo is oftentimes more frustrating than fun.However if you’re itching for a hardcore co-op action experience, then you’ve struck gold with Forced."

The first few trials are fun, but then you hit trial 5 and 6 and realize that not only will you be facing off against multiple enemies who move faster than you, but you will need to try and fight them while trying to move the orb around.  The enemies will surround and overwhealm you.  Maybe I just missed something, but the youtube videos that showed how to do these levels were people who had already earned the crystals needed to unlock more advanced abilities.  I'm disappointed but hopeful that I can get a friend to play this with me and maybe my experience with the game will be different."

Some levels are almost purely slow puzzly levels, some are fast paced fighting levels and rest are some combination of those two.Game mechanics are simple and are introduced sufficiently smoothly so you don't feel overwhelmed. Later on these mechanics are combined in various ways and the game never feels boring.Biggest con for this game would be that its not a single-player game.

When I play this, I get quite frustrated, but I like a good challenge.Some of the challenges seem impossible, but it might just be because I'm a newb.In this game, each ""level"" is referred to as a trial.Each trial has 3 achievements you can unlock:-Completing the Level-A unique level challenge (such as beating a level without killing monster spawn points, etc.)-And beating the level with a speed run aspect to it (Time Trials).When you beat a trial, you earn ""crystals"" which are basically level ups for your gladiator.Crystals unlock active and passive skills to make your hero stronger.There are 4 Heroes (weapons), you can choose from, and that you can change at any point in the game:-Volcanic Hammer (Warrior class)-Spirit Claws (Rogue class)-Ice Shield (Paladin class)-Storm Bow (Hunter class)It plays like an arcade game, but man, it is pretty hard, and my frustration is a 9/10 most of the time. lolThe cool thing with this game, is that the puzzles and monster spawns scale with the number of players in a game.So the more players, the harder the game is!For completionists, the good thing is that you can compare your rankings with other players from around the globe to see how well (or poorly) you've done.All in all, a good game, and would recommend even at full price. :)[END OF EDIT]~~~~~~~~~~So far so good!I've been eyeing this game for quite some time now, and have passed up various Steam sales, either out of forgetfulness or laziness.66% Off, 50% Off, I finally picked this game up for $2.24 (85% Off), and the initial game play is decent so far.Initially, the game has a Gauntlet Legends/Warcraft 3: Custom Map/Use Map Settings vibe to it.The game plays similar to StarCraft 2 Challenges, mixed with some Gauntlet Legends-Arcade style vibe to it.I've read the reviews prior to mine where the difficulty ramps up as the game progresses, and isn't fair towards the later stages of the game... (Dungeon Defenders suffers from that, where you HAVE to play with people)I haven't gotten that far yet, however, when I get to that point, I'll be able to update this review and give my whole-hearted opinion of the game.There is one thing though: the story/voice acting, albeit, is minimal thus far, is very lacking/dry. (Supposedly the game was created with a team of 7, so it's just a side thought.  You aren't playing the game for voice acting, you're playing it for the fun factor!)All in all, the Trials are challenging... it gets me frustrated trying to race the clock and I get killed in the process. lol.I promise to update this review as I progress in the game. :)"
,Recommended,249990,33054700,Posted: 30 June,all,scathelock,"What separates a cheap gimmick from a solid game mechanic is that a gimmick is a cute trick that's shown once, easily implemented, and then forgotten about. In ""Forced"", you're introduced to a variety of simple mechanics - but after learning them, you actually have to plan out your approach, and then you have to execute those mechanics under evolving conditions.As a gladiator, you can equip one of four weapons, all of which are made available to you at the start and can be swapped out whenever you're not in a combat arena. What's impressive is that each one feels distinctly unique yet  equally effective. There is no ""right"" answer, but you need to familiarize yourself with whatever skillset you choose. Want to detonate kamikaze creeps at a distance with the Bow and Arrow? You'll have to position yourself so your line of sight isn't blocked by other enemies or obstacles. Or would you rather stand fast and absorb their explosions with the Shield? You'll need to make sure that your Blocking ability hasn't been triggered by other creeps by the time they connect. Or would you prefer setting them off with the invincibility frame of the Dagger's dash? You'd best double-check that you aren't dashing into an even worse position. ""Forced"" also uses my favorite kind of customization system, the kind that rewards good performance and encourages experimentation: outside of combat, you're free to mix and match any three active and three passive abilities that you've unlocked. This isn't a game for grinding - if you want to mindlessly farm loot for better gear and levels, search elsewhere. ""Forced"" is looking for players to go in, die, figure out what else they could try or how they could better execute their plan, and then go in again.And on that note, you will definitely die, frequently with a curse on your lips. You will curse the fixed camera angle. You will curse the melee aiming controls. You will curse the occasionally dodgy hitbox. And then you'll put all of that aside and stubbornly head back into the same arena, and tackle the same enemies with a bit more insight and a touch more finesse, and then, suddenly, you'll have completed the Challenge and beaten the Time Limit and shout in triumph as you finally relax and soak in the feeling of a victory well earned.The majority of my game time has been spent playing solo, which can be satisfying if you're the masochistic type; the game definitely wants to be played with friends. The framing device is another nice little touch. While it's nothing deep - just some light set dressing - the setting is plausible and manages to set itself apart from the typical ""heroic journey to kill the ancient evil and seize forbidden treasure"" cliche. Each of the major bosses has enough style to differentiate himself from the others, and Balfus has enough dialogue variety that he never becomes an annoyance.""Forced"" is by no means a perfect game (refer to the aforementioned sources of cursing) but it definitely carves out a memorable niche for itself. This is the proving grounds for gamers to test their timing, planning and patience. If you're the sort who's willing to go after tricky challenge objectives and you feel like beating down a small horde of monsters along the way, then grab some buddies and arm up: this arena could take a while."
76561198084000741,Not Recommended,249990,14199399,"Posted: 27 January, 2015",all,ripper,"The game is quite different from what I expected when I was buying it. It's not that much about puzzles or real combat skills (I imagined something like dodging at the right time, using different attacks per enemy weaknesses, combo-ing, etc). No, it's more about great cooperation between players (voice chat is an absolute must), selecting correct skills from the skill tree for that particular level, and, unfortunately, also about grinding. The game is quite hard, don't expect a casual multiplayer co-op game. You'll need to repeat every level many times to at least finish it. And then, you'll need to repeat it many times more in order to fulfill the challenge or time criteria. If you don't do it, you'll be very much underpowered in the later levels and the difficulty will go from high to insane.So, the principle of the game is not to enjoy many different levels. The number or levels is quite low (25). The principle of the game is to rinse and repeat until you finish themperfectly. It's not what I expected and it's not what I enjoy, but tastes differ, I'm sure many people will like it. That's not why I'm giving it a thumbs down.The thumbs down goes for technical execution. From technical level, this game is horrible. Network issues are extremely common - the game splits and people see different things on their screens, someone can't move at all, someone dies but gets stuck in the dying animation and glitches the level, unable to complete it, and the list goes on. But, that's not the worst thing. The worst thing is thecamera. It deserves a paragraph on its own.The camera. The devs had an idea that you need to see all characters at the same time, all the time. So if you go into different directions, the camera zooms out to make sure you see all characters. Questionably a good idea, with the worst implementation ever. First, this camera mode is mandatory, you can't switch between ""focused camera"" (seeing just yourself in the center of the screen) and ""overview camera"" (seeing everyone). No, it's just the overview camera. So, if you go far apart (necessary in some levels), you're zoomed out immensely, and your characters (and enemies) are very small. Try to use your skills effectively then! You're also in a corner or near the edge of the screen, so you have no idea what's near you in certain directions. The camera constantly shifts (as others move around), which throws your aim out of balance (especially frustration when playing the archer character). And to top all of that, the devs even botched it so much, that very often the camera actually crops your character and you're behind the edge or the corner of the screen! So, you don't actually see yourself, or the enemies around you, and you're expected to fight them and survive. Please don't forget this game is extremely punishing for even the smallest errors. You'll cry, you'll shout, you'll tear things apart. That's how bad the camera is.One final note, this game has to be played with a stable group of friends. No one might be missing any time. The reason is that every time you start a game, you'll only receive those gems, which have been completed by *all* members of the party. So if one of your friends was not available last time, you'll need to repeat all levels with him/her again, and complete all of it again. This was not the best design choice, and again, you have no option to configure this, you need to live with it. Consider it, if you don't have a stable group of friends to play and finish this game with.So, to sum it up, the game mechanics are not necessarily bad, they can be even enjoyable. But the technical execution is definitely a reason to avoid this game. And that's 18 months after release, so there's no hope of having it improved, ever."

It's a challenge even if you don't look to complete all the achievement ( I did...I got hooked...It's awesome ^^ ). You never stop improving and if you're up to the challenge, you're going to have loads of fun.The adventure is great, with a steady learning curve. You get to learn how to play each of these four badasses if you feel like it or you can just go and solo one of them if you have a favourite, it's not impossible to finish the game if you do.Bosses are sometimes a bit easy because the strats are quite simple to understand BUT most of them are still challenging because in this game, knowing what to do is the easy part, being able to do it is a whole other story.If you have a trustworthy group of friends though, buy the fourpack, and solve these levels together. The more the merrier. Really. Especially since some of these levels take you by surprise : there's nothing funnier than seeing your friends panic and getting slaughtered in every side of the map because of some new content to the game ^^ (Beware of the fog !).Finally, the new mode they added, survival mode, is a gem. The first levels are a bit easy to beat imo, compared to the rest of the game, but the last one is....evil. I can't imagine playing with 4 players in this last level, but I'm guessing it must be the funniest experience this game has to offer. You'll understand once you get there ^^Also, there is a 'last man standing' level in these survival maps which seems pretty interesting and very promising in a way that I'll surely spend nights with my friends playing this level only and having fun helping/betraying your friends to survive the longest time possible =D.Overall an incredible game for those who like puzzles, badass characters with skill trees and passive trees, and last but not least, a little bit of challenge, for a price that is, in my opinion way underappreciated."

I don't see how a single player can do it with out spending alot of time redoing the missions or watch a youtube video on tme. We play about 10 missions and we completed in 5 mins or less per mission. Some of the time trials wanted you to complete the mission in a min or less. I purchase this for my brother and me and with two players using TeamSpeaker we had a hard time and it was not enjoyable.Game play was more like,move the orb around, light this stuff with the orb, blow this up with the orb, kill this device with the orb, then a hack and slash game with puzzles. We forgot all about the mobs and was just trying to get the mission done in time. I feel like the mobs of bad guys was just an annoyance and didn't help the game play. When you goal is trying to solve a puzzle in time, to get the crystals, to get new powers.I would not recommend this game, unless you like replaying the same lvl over and over and over to get the pattern down on using the orb at the right time to get all the crystals.  Also the game ""About the Game"" is so short, i believe because they was afraid if they gave you too much info you would not play the game.

That said, the game was quite fun with one other person and requires a signifcant amount of teamwork to complete challenges and to fight bosses.FORCED is an interesting take on the action rpg genre. Instead of running around solely fighting hordes of monsters, you have arenas that you must enter and complete challenges. You also have an NPC that you must guide around who is an integral part of completing these challenges, which usually involves calling him to particular locations, causing him to move over shrines or other objectives to complete objectives while monsters are there to get in the way and make things more difficult. I wouldn't go so far as to call these challenges puzzles, as it is usually pretty obvious what needs to be done and is more a matter of execution.There are a panoply of abilities you can unlock to help you destroy monsters. They are unlocked by completing arenas, completing them quickly, and by doing special objectives in them. There are four classes and you are not tied to a particular one. You can change your class any time you are not in an arena and you will have the same tier of abilities unlocked on each character, so you don't have to level each one or anything like that.The boss arenas are fun and each one has their own interesting set of mechanics. A few of the arenas and one of the boss fights in particular (the skeleton, for reference) are quite difficult, but that just makes beating them all the more satisfying.So all in all, a fun game to play co-op. I'm not sure about the single player aspect of the game. Having had a multiplayer play through, I have no interest in going through a second run solo."

The only way 2 ppl could play locally together is 1 with a controller and the other w/ a keyboard and mouse. I bought it specifically because it was listed for local co-op and FULL controller support, which is obviously incorrect.If they fix the issues, it would be a great game.

You play as 1-4victims,moving targets,corpses-to-be...Gladiatorssubject to arenas spanning a superb mix of combat, puzzles and planning. The ability to align yourself to 1 of 4 weapons is also pretty fun - particularly mixing and matching different abilities and passive bonuses. Just be aware that, in my experience, some builds (or even weapons) tend to favour certain levels more than others - so be prepared to alter your build to beat each level, as opposed to finding a single, favourite combo to play the whole game with.The levels are delightfully varied and have their own unique twist. The 3 challenges (and rewards) for each level are also a great touch: 1 for just winning, 1 for beating the time limit and 1 for overcoming a special condition. As such, there's a lot to do and a lot to master.But therein lies the catch, it's gladiatorial in more ways than one... it's bloody difficult. After the first level or 2, the ante quickly ramps up and you need to be quick on your feet, well-coordinated and honed to a fine edge. So expect to die a fair bit and understand that completing all the challenges will require a fair bit of practice (or outright stubbornness).This, too, applies to co-op; this is most definitely a cooperative game... not a party game. The game scales the number of enemies, time challenges and even puzzles with the more players you have, so the difficulty is always there. Unfortunately this means that your team will all equally need to be sharp and willing to put in the time and communication to master the levels. The game will unceremoniously prune weaker players, leaving a harder level for everyone else - which can quickly kill the fun for casual gamers. As such, single player is considerably more enjoyable than playing with an uncoordinated team, so bear this in mind if you're looking for multiplayer games to share with your gaming buddies.The final catch is that (annoyingly) the network connections between players can be a little inconsistent (though this was a few years ago). I could easily create a party of 2 players - but would always have trouble getting the 3rd on board. A bit frustrating for a game specialised for co-op.But playing solo, I've find this to be a very enjoyable and varied challenge... if a little intense at times. It's unforgiving but equally rewarding when you nail it. One to dip into when you really fancy a tough gaming wall to climb."

Unlike other ARPGs or whatever we call these it's not focused around finding gear and leveling up. Instead each stage has a mission, a purpose. These are simple puzzles or annoying challenges that you need to find a plan on how to solve. It could be lasers, or bombs or just a simple ""kill everything mission"". After a mission you are returned to a ""world map"" inbetween missions. You may change between 4 classes and 2 people can't be the same class. The classes act a little different and are good for different things.In each mission you can earn 3 crystals, which is basically the leveling up system of the game. Once you reach a certain number of crystals you unlock additional skills you can use instead of the basic ones. How do you earn the crystals? It's a little different depending on the mission but mostly it's about clearing the mission within a certain time frame, not taking damage or doing something fancy.Great game, but play with some friends."

He has a mental disorder, so he's got multiple personalities and one of them is a capital arsehat. that's why you have to be a gladiator.Once they establish the plot, you get to punch a scarecrow with a weapon and then you get to punch it REALLY hard and then you're a real gladiator. This is a good game to play with a controller. After you're a real gladiator, you have to go fight real enemies, and then you're a true gladiator. Once you do that, you can start playing actual levels, and then you can be acknowledged as a gladiator.Levels are fun with friends, if you happen to have any. Friends are useful because they do everything wrong and will inevitably make the game harder. So don't try to play this with friends, they're usually really bad at this. If you do play with friends out of the kindness of your heart, it is not required that you acknowledge them as gladiators. You may opt to refer to them as peasent, commoner, or perhaps dead.Fighting is fun because you pick a weapon and then you kill enemies with it. When you kill an enemy a few times, it loses health and gains marks instead. Marks are sort of like a currency in this game, where enemies can trade you their health points for more marks. Once they've made this trade, they can opt  to sell them to you in exchange for more damage. Through this method, you can kill enemies, and become a gladiator.Becoming a gladiator is harder than just killing enemies though. you need to get crystals and stuff, and those let you get more abilities and passive things and active abilities and passive abilities, as well as skills which you acquire by collecting gems.There is also a soundtrack in the game, although I do not remember any of it. It is probably gladiator music. I can not confirm this. I would give this game anywhere from 10 to 12 dollars, because I think it was on sale.Now is a good time to buy it, since you can get it at full price again.This is a definite must-have for anyone that thinks they might like to be a gladiator, in any sense of the word."

FORCED has some issues, but it's well worth your time to play, especially if you can play with friends.Upon starting FORCED, I faced some serious problems trying to get controllers working. Supposedly these issues have all been fixed now, so hopefully you won't suffer the same hassles.  Even if you do, however, I recommend you perservere and get it set up to play.FORCED is first and foremost a puzzle game. Yes, the combat plays a significant part, and you will get good at the combat (and will need to), but the puzzles and the teamplay is what makes the game.  Trying to work out how to complete levels, and then complete the challenges and time trials is genuinely fun and will make you think and strategise, which is a really refreshing change of pace from so many other games.Perhaps the biggest issues are the occasional bug that can make a level impossible, the aforementioned controller issues, and the skill unlock progression.  Some of the high levels skills unlocked later in the game are *really* underwhelming given the effort you've gone to acquire them, and the last unlock requires you to complete everything in order to obtain. That's right, you have to do everything in the game in order to unlock the last abilities, and even if they weren't hideously disappointing (which they are), that would leave you with nothing to do with that ability.While FORCED enjoyable solo, I would most heartily recommend it as a fantastic game to play local co-op, I've read reports of issues with the net-code for playing with others online, but playing with multiple people on one screen is great.I'd really love to see more from FORCED. I'd love to see more levels, and ideally some reworking of some of the skills available - there are a number that are basically useless.  Still, FORCED is well worth your money and your time."

It kept me up till 5:30 am, and I hadn't had this happen in quite a few years. FORCED is like the child of Diablo and Zelda (the games! not the characters :P). If you like both ARPGs and puzzle / platformers this is for you.You play as a Gladiator, a soul bred and trained for one purpose; to fight and survive the challenges of the Arena. Your spirit mentor, a blue wisp, guides you through these challenges. The game is split up into 4 (from what I can tell) segments, each with 5 trials and a guardian (boss). Each trial (including the guardian) has both a challenge and a time trial as well for extra gems - which you use to unlock skills. It looks like it will keep you busy for at least a dozen hours, if not more.In each Trial, the goal is always very clear, but don't expect ""how on earth do I get there?"" to also be clear ;) The puzzles pose various tactical (planning) and practical (execution) challenges - some of them very hard. The different classes / abilities aren't just reskins of eachother, they have very distinct effects and there's some synergy within the class itself. The difficulty & learning curve ramp up very smoothly. I also liked that all classes play very well with both keyboard / mouse & controller. Except the archer - he's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to aim with a controller. The only major downside I found was that the combat felt a bit stiff - I had a feeling I was constantly missing a couple more active abilities in my arsenal. Maybe a dodge/block/parry with a really small cooldown?The visual direction this game has is great. You take a random screenshot, it's gonna look beautiful. Very nice color pallette, and it's very functional as well. You never really have ""I didn't see that"" or ""where am I"" moments, even amidst chaotic battles. The game's soundtracks are also very well composed and fit each level. SFX are well designed as well, though nothing special. But what really sells the audio of the game is the voice acting. It's actually acting, as opposed to just reading lines. And it's not just your spirit mentor, but the bosses as well, which really helps build up the anticipation of facing them. The game isn't story-heavy (nor does it have to be) but the plot is quite interesting and well written.Overall the gameplay nailed it for me.

When the complexity (not difficulty) ramps up you begin to realise the flaws.Flaw 1: The Camera is Horrible. This game is centered around it's co-op mode and it could be fun, but the game currently runs on a single camera system that always keeps you, you parner and or the boss in it's view. This is fine until the level complexity increases at which point characters can become very hard to see and the camera distances itself massivly. A bug also occurs here where you can actually walk your character off camera, and if your team members are fighting or solving in opposite corners you can't see youself at all, causing all sorts of issues. Local Camera is heavily needed, keep the player and the Boss (for example) and fix the edge Clipping, letting your party do as they please, Colored Player indicators are amazing in that situation to determine where people are, or even a very simple minimap if its THAT complicated.Flaw 2: That leads me nicely onto this. The company have decided to op out of being able to walk through your enemys. This feels good until you encounter more then 2-3 at once, at which Point they surround you, locking you in place as you can't Push them. There are knockback mechanics and escape mechanics you can choose for your character. But now you find yourself in a position where fun or damage talents are unusable because you need movement survival and escape for when you get Trapped or Knocked back. This ALSO has a bug of its own, where EVERY ability that can be classed as an escape or survival can just ranomdly not work (Non more evident than using the shield weapons 'dash' ability, where it often takes you no-where, despite showing the animations of you moving, or even teleports you back to where you started)Flaw 3: The gameplay lends itself to heavy hack and slash combat that's real fun. But more enemys means you quickly start to realise an issue. You can't Heal. 2/4 classes have heals, one is decent but on a LONG Cooldown (And interuptable via knockback), and the other is a heal over time effect with a speed boost, that whilst being mandetory is only useful for the speed, and requires spamming. The only other way to heal is the Poles you can drift the Orb over, which also require spamming in order to stand a chance. What this leads to is a Cluster F*** of enemys who synergise very badly and do nothing but follow you in a Lump. You find yourself unable to find many safe attack areas and spend the majority of combat running around avoiding the fight because you can't heal, or because the enemys invincible until the boss gives you a charge to defeat him (a charge you can only call to you, and that almost Kills you if it detonates nearby).All in all, this game has the potential to be one of the best co-ops out there, These issues however make it frustrating and awkward to play. After a lot of frustrating game mechanics issues, we left Forced behind at level 2. No amount of skill or learning will get you past RNG when your dash's, escapes and heals don't work. No amount of skill or enjoment will get you past camera fails, where you cannot see your Chatacer.Current? 3/10These simple issues Fixed? 7-8/10 EASILY."

But seriously this game is tons of fun. It's not exactly story-rich, but thats not really something you look for in this style of game. The four characters to pick from are a good representation of different play styles, and the variety of spells allow for some customization to that as well. The levels are more than just navigating through the map; the puzzles are very challenging at times, and the boss levels are actually tough. To me, those two points determine the success or failure of this style of game, and Forced is a winner in both categories.Pros:Challenging puzzlesTough boss levelsCons:Thin story (but seriously, who cares about that? That's like complaining that the Dota 2 lore is weak.)One more thing: go to BetaDwarf's site, and read about how while programming this game, they literally lived in part of a college that wasn't being used for almost a year before they got caught and kicked out! It's hilarious, and there's no way you won't buy the game after that. Better yet, buy the 4-pack and your friends will be FORCED to play with you!"

Balfus and the fact that you can use him by calling him toward you, lighting torches (and some other things) is the main reason this game stands out as it adds some great and diverse tactics that always serve towards your goal of earning the 3 Gems each level (arena) has to offer. The story is not this game's strong point as the plot is fairly simple.

Sadly, the game idea that Forced is needs much more...For Single-Players, or Solo-Play:The attempt at a story is more of a hinderance and should've been left out almost all together. The general direction in design is pretty spotty and left me feeling non-plussed several times as I attempted to learn one mechanic or another. The challenges are a bit too tightly setup, and are limited in scope. Thus, completing challenges unlocks abilites, and so you find yourself ""forced"" to wait for much good deal of the fun the game can provide, repeating the same stages over and over. Also, a key element in the game, your spirit mentor, could be so much more interesing. Last but not least, the graphics really could be better, indie or not.As much as Forced is a solid idea, the production quality and execution are both sadly lackluster...and that voice acting...yikes."

So many are shy of satisfying.Fortunately, this one steps up.Levels and puzzles have more variation and inginuity to them that your typical game. It had me looking forward to the next map.Persistent character gain (skills and skill slots) unlock via gaining gems (basically exp). Beating a single map feels like a win. (i dislike the modern fad of games resetting every time)Levels are replayable and have very decent challenges to gain additional gems. I usually tend to avoid this in similar game, but found it reasonable and enjoyable in this game.Gameplay definitely encourages cooperation. while i think it would suffer single player, 2-player was a blast and it is supposed to tailor difficulty to the number of players.Additional notes:*aside from explosive level objects, there is no player damage (As i definitely prefer!).*difficulty is generally moderate to a bit challenging. The game sets you up to have consistent challenge, driving you to stay alive. You will die, but it will be fun trying not to. (I am definitely not into ""hardcore mode"" games. I want a reasonable challenge, not a chore or test in patience). A reasonable gamer should expect to die a couple times and then succeed on most levels. Children may have a hard time.*the game also feels much more polished than many recent games. (no pixel=style laziness, and no half thought out levels)"

In most levels the best ways to move is diagonal and even between the 16 directions that keyboards offers.

But pretty awesome.The combat isn't the best ever, but it's definitely not bad. It's the mix of both that makes this a really fun title.If I had to rate it, based on a limited amount of playtime, I'd say 8/10.I haven't played it by myself, or with only 1 or 2 people so I can't say for those groups. But 4 players is really fun. Especially if people start getting confused with who is who. Not sure how they do it but 2 of our group tend to do that, and in some levels you can't get out of a certain area or you take massive damage, and they'd just randomly venture out and die. Or think they're someone else and walk into a huge laser. It's pretty entertaining.I'd say the main reason why my rating isn't higher than 8 is because I thought there'd be a bit more puzzle-based levels. Or longer levels. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind short levels. But I find that co-op games are best when thrown into puzzle environments. Games like Trine 2, Battleblock Theater, Portal 2, Tiny Brains etc are great examples of that. (BBT isn't as much puzzle-based but you get the idea).So it's mostly just my opinion really. I haven't seen any huge cons yet, quite a few pros, and the game was crazy cheap during the sale, 100% worth it(7.50$ for a 4pack, 2.50$ per individual game) and that's Canadian money. And our money isn't worth much lately, so you know that's a pretty decent deal.Anyway, I've talked long enough, eh? Sorry for taking all of your time if you read all this.

Maybe further in the game there's more stuff added but clicking on the small variety of enemies with the same 2 attacks in miniscule maps is just not enough to make me want to progress.Oh and the puzzle aspect is so basic, tedious and unrewarding that its not really worth mentioning.But hey, the graphics aren't bad."

The casual player could try and hack & slash their way through the game, but for more hardcore gamers there are times to beat and challenges to conquer on every stage which require a lot more thinking and strategy.  Another great feature is that most levels usually take under 5 minutes which make this a great game to sit down to if you don't have hours and hours to play.This is a really well made indie game that I'd say competes with the big market games.

In short you are solving puzzles in a dungeon/instances with your partner while mobs attack you.Imagine sitting together with your 360 controllers (or on skype) running around avoiding a laser beam while trying to kill mobs that are attacking you. Meanwhile your co-op partner is aligning Balfus (a floating orb) in a straight line towards you and screaming at you to pull the orb so that it goes through a shrine that stops a deadly mists that is slowly filling the dungeon. You pull the orb towards you but just when the orb is about to turn off the the mist your co-op partner gets pinned by a mob he didn't avoid and needs to call the orb back to him to free himself. Now the mist is out of control and your coop partner is low on health. This is a basic scenario in Forced.The game has several dungeons/levels that you have to complete. Each dungeon rewards a total of 3 crystals. One for completing the dungeon, one for a speed/timed run and one for completing with a special requirement (e.g no healing, not getting hit by a special mob, etc).Before each dungeon you choose to play one of four available classes. A warrior, rogue, hunter and a tank. Every class has two talent trees: One tree for active talents and one for passive talents. As you earn more crystals you unlock more of your talents.  You get to choose 3 active and 3 passive skills. That means that you have 4 buttons to press: One for basic attack and three for active talents.This is a game where you can play competitvely and min/max what class and what spec to play for eac dungeon. make a tactic and practice exucuting it impeccably or you can grab a 360 controller and have fun with your girlfriend on the couch."

The payoff here is great; I received immense satisfaction from figuring out puzzles and performing insanely powerful attacks by coordinating with someone else. I firmly believe the best way to experience FORCED is with a dedicated partner or three so that you can complete the entire game with the same group of people.That being said, the puzzles are not very complicated at all. The true difficulty will be in attempting Challenges (finishing a level while achieving a specific goal) and Time Trials (finishing a level within a certain amount of time). Completing Challenges and Time Trials will require attempt after attempt after attempt. Beta Dwarf could have planned for this a bit better and not put as many long cut scenes in inconvenient places, but you can skip after a few seconds. Nevertheless, Challenges and Time Trials give this title some serious replayability. The game is fun enough to justify multiple (read: dozens of) consecutive attempts. I did not feel like I had completed the game until I had all 75 gems, which took roughly 47 hours.The online infrastructure can be a little rough. We had to exit out of the game and set it back up once every 1-1.5 hours or so due to game crashing bugs or unresponsive controls. However, it is important to note that the gameplay made it worth it. We kept coming back to it because of the addictive gem collecting and the fun, rewarding combat system. Mercifully, Beta Dwarf has insured that load times are minimal and creating/joining a game are very simple. This means setting up a game is a trivial affair, and the inconvenience of the (infrequent) game crashing bugs is mitigated.The combat system is the crux of the gameplay. Basic attacks leave enemies with marks. Depending on what abilities your character has, marks can cause special attacks to do more damage.The abilities you equip your character with (up to 3 active and 3 passive) give you perks and access to powerful attacks. Discovering synergy between passives and actives is one of the most compelling reasons to keep playing the game and adds strategy to what would otherwise be a mindless beat-em-up.Gems enable you to unlock abilities and equip yourself with more abilities. There are 75 in the game, three for each level (1 for beating the level, 1 for completing the challenge, 1 for beating the Time Trial). Every few gems you score, you unlock a new ability, which adds to the sense of progress throughout the game and encourages you to experiment with your new found awesomeness.It is important to note that the experience I am praising arose from me from having a friend that was dedicated to playing the game. I cannot speak to the game's singleplayer mode, but I also cannot see it providing the same sense of accomplishment, nor can I see it motivating me in the same way to attempt each level the insane number of times I did. It always helped to have someone to talk to and discuss strategies with. With that understood, I give it...8.7/10I hope Beta Dwarf keeps making awesome multiplayer games with over-the-top bosses.TL;DR : Great gameplay, adequate online connectivity, don't get it if you don't have friends."

Each trial has 3 crystals to obtain, one for completing the level, one for completing a said challenge within the trial and one for compelting the trial within a time limit. Some of the challanges are impossible to get at a lower level which means you need revisit levels you have done before to increase your crystal total.A fun game with depth that I did not expect.

You control 1 of 4 different characters (hammer, bow, shield, daggers) each has their own set of skills, passives, and playstyles. You work with your friends to navigate innovative maps and figure out puzzles all with the help of a little orb spirt guy. Every person can call this orb to their position so it can be trolly if everyone is spamming. It requires a great deal of communication as it sometimes requires you to bounce the orb from person to person but without letting it hit objects (part of the puzzle). I highly recommend you pick this up in a 4 pack and play with friends over voice chat as it can be very fun, quirky, rewarding, and frustrating all in one but there is sense of accomplishment similar to when you first beat a boss in an MMO when you nail a puzzle while 3 of your friends are dead and you are teetering on life.

At first the game teaches you the simple mechanics as you learn each of the classes. As you progress into the next world, the game does get harder, with enemies being tougher and puzzles more challenging, but as you master that world, the next is even more difficult, where you and your friends have to work very hard to complete each challenge. Has a very nice levelling and upgrade system, could use some work, balancing, etc. The only problem I have, is Singleplayer and Multiplayer difficulty scaling. Want to play past the second world by yourself? Well that is near impossible. I am not sure if this has been fixed yet, but BetaDwarf should consider to make the game easier (lower enemy spawns, health, damage, etc.) when by yourself. Also I've noticed an uneven scaling with two to three to four players. I believe three is the easiest. Other than that you'll probably snag a good 5-20 hours based on how much you enjoy it, and if you have a small group of friends this is a great game to spend those hours together.

Some abilities are completely worthless but it is well made how each person has a different role to play and is quite different. The problem is based off horrible limiting/restricting design decisions. For no apparent reason, they take the moronic ""super meat-boy"" approach of screwing you over if you can't beat the level in the exact way they intended you to. The levels are hard enough in themselves and take 5-8 minutes each. You only get new abilities for beating levels, and for beating in in a time limit they choose and by completing a challenge they made up. The first problem is you don't know the challenge till after you beat the level which shows how much they want to artificially inflate game length by having you replay the exact same level multiple times. The time limits and challenges are not even remotely fair or achievable without dozens of attempts of the exact same level, of 6 minutes or so, spending hours on a single level. Why would you not want someone to get to use abilities you made for characters? Biggest problem is that althought you can move through the entire game gaining the crystal for beating the level, the final boss requires a stupid amount of crystals, basically making my entire playthrough a waste of time because I couldn't beat the levels in the exact amount of time developers and tryhards do.........If people like repeatedly playing levels over and over give time limits and challenges that help for leaderboards and rankings, idiots eat that Sh-it up. But don't keep me from getting abilities and from beating the game without letting me know beforehand. Amateur game-making at its finest. Why not have the best of both worlds......it's just ridiculous how a college kid thinks of better game design and implimentation than game developers.....guess the one of the hamsters in the wheels got loose. 5/10"

We played this for a few hours but eventually abandoned it when we got to a level we couldn't get past.The game does a good job of forcing players to actually cooperate. But we found that when we only had 2-players that the levels became brutally hard. A single death meant all of the enemies homed in on the last man standing. Add in a few levels with insta-death from lazer-like barriers and we reached a level (after only 2 hours; the Slarth boss-fight) where the difficulty ramped up past our skill.A quick check of Steam stats shows that only 19% of players beat Slarth.It stopped being fun, so we moved on to other games. Maybe it is better with 4 players? Or maybe we're just not good enough (but I've played a decent amount of Super Meat Boy so I'm not TERRIBLE). Either way, the frustration exceeded the fun for us."

Throughout the year they send warriors from their village to go deep into the realms to battle the guardians and try to defeat them, but none prevailed. After a long await four warriors came forth from the villages and started to slay the Guardians as one god tries to guide them through the realms or chaos. As the Warriors it's your destiny to send them to the right path.Graphics:Throughout the game the graphics for this game have been great quality and had had some amazing sceneries, not a lot is need to play this game and with a lot more room for improvement I wouldn't put any bad remarks towards this game just yet, with the design and the equipment, to the boss and bad guys. The game shows the player it can be like WoW and Rift, full of imagination and fantastic detail in the structuresGame play:The game play in this game was very easy to understand, with the first few levels explain how certain objects word, the game challenges you through the levels, making sure you are fully aware of what certain things do and how to stop them. The game is based on a third person play and you can roam around the game with either a keyboard and mouse or a Controller.for those who are PC gamers keyboard and mouse was easier for the bow master, but I personally liked the controller because of close combat so try and find something that'll suit your style. I play Volcanic Hammer and controller was my thing, but when it came to bow I had to switch.The detail in the inventory and explanation were simple and this is what a game need as for beginner people feel comfortable knowing what's going on throughout the start and not be pressured and button mash. Each character has different abilities and fighting styles, if you read the spoiler then you understand what I mean. But try and find the right warrior for you and play with him till you get used to his abilities and powers.Advantages:This is one of the funniest Coop RPG games I played, with me and my mates we flied through the levels and got more excited as the game went on, the boss and ideas that were put into the puzzles were genius, as well as hard.this game is good at both Single player and Coop. with coop play the game is at its best, you can roam and fight and work together to counter every possible bad guys and boss, but they also help you with strategies as all weapons will be in your arsenal so go and find the best ways to different each level.Disadvantages:As much as I love this game, there are a few bugs and downers on this game, one of them is the servers, through the game it won’t let you access other servers or game plays when you play coop, also when you host a game is sometimes freezes the game and closes the game down, making you restart from your last checkpoint, luckily this doesn't erase you data and you keep all you equipment, but this will frustrate you big time, even if your near completion or in the middle of a boss battle.Overall:I believe that even though this game has a lot of problems with it, I'm going to give it faith and say it's still a great game, the Developer is personally speaking to me and with anyone else who is in trouble and will help you throughout the game. For now I will give this game a 6/10 due to the bugs, but I recommend this game in the future.  With the designers fixing every problem and working hard on the patches this game will be a major success in the future. So don't get dishearted just yet. With the future patches I believe this game can hit 9.5/10 in my books as long as the serves get fixed and the game play continues.Thanks you for reading and peace out :)"

What I got was a poorly optimized game with iOS game-style level design and netcode issues.One of the primary mechanics in the game is this orb which each player can call to their location. It seems all puzzles, if you can even call them that, are based on this mechanic. The problem here is that these puzzles are all really uninventive and quite frankly boring, and using the orb for all puzzles doesn't make for a rewarding and interesting experience.The level design reminds me of iOS games because of its infatuation of having really short, play-while-you're-on-the-toilet missions which give you a ranking between 1 and 3 depending on how well you did. One for completing the level, one for doing some special thing, and one for doing it quickly. I really think this is ahorriblepractice for PC games and I was hoping for some Diablo-style adventuring which would fit the game a lot better than how it is now.These problems combined with the shoddy netcode (this was playing with 3 others with pings varying between 10-30ms) lead to a really unresponsive and disapointingly mediocre experience."

The four classes (per say) encompass a variety of play styles so there is something for everyone and your not just stuck with one, you can switch freely which adds a large amount of gameplay and replay. Finding the class you like after a little trial and error begins the actual fun part. The trails themselves require skill to finish and even more to clear all the challenges. Completing the level and unlocking the next isnt that difficult and you can take your time. Finishing the time trials and other challenges is where the real skill comes in. Some challenges are hard (time mostly), others take a little thought on execution, and the rest fall into the medium range. Overall the feeling you get from beating the obstacles, killing things, killing more things, completeing objectives is rewarding and a fun experience.Graphics are not an eye sore and seem rather polished for what it is.

You can move and fire your bow which is a positive aspect about this game, I appreciated this because i've played Alien Swarm and i like the movement controls. There's an ability to switch between controller and keyboard and mouse and the support for controller is great. The negative aspects of this game is that people can't join while your playing, if they do then you have to restart your game if you want them to play, you can't make private matches, if someone leaves the game then you are taken back to multiplayer screen. I don't find any technical problems with this game."

FORCED. Seems good, no weight.Okay, now for the lengthy bit....What do you mean by 'no weight'? well, that's pretty straight forward really, every strike, stab, stomp and shot you perform has no impression of impact in the sound or visual effects, it doesn't feel like you are striking down someone to the pits of the earth, it feels like you are pushing them over so they gentle fall onto a bed.Now, while this may make sense for the assassin-type character, this should not be the case with the warrior wielding a freaking HUGE FLAMING AXE.Don't get me wrong, the art-style is nice, the puzzles are cool, the soundtrack would be nice if you didn't have to choose between silence or being deafened and perhaps that's also the reason the fighting sucks, you have to turn the game sounds so far down in order to be able to hear your friends that you miss out on any subtle sounds such as impacts and also miss out on the soundtrack. The guide however? Oh, he'll violate your ear-drums silly if you don't shut him up quickly.Overall, FORCED probably isn't that bad, but it just wasn't mine or my friends' cup of tea. It was just boring, and trust me, I really wanted to enjoy it."

The glitches in the current version make it nearly unplayable.Me and three friends tried playing a few games together - all of us had issues at different intervals using/equipping new skills, which then doesn't allow movement onto the next stage. Start over a new game.Second try we experienced the same issue with different players. Third try I became de-synched during a match so the best I could do was attempt to keep up while my character slowly glitched around, lagging behind the party who were still fully functioning. I'd have to say this caused more unintended hilarity and fun in the game than when the game was running smoothly.Toss in a few random crashes, and we haven't really bothered playing this since.With a bit of polish it might be fun, and the graphics are ""ok"" but not awe inspiring or even surprising. The level design is fairly straight forward, and the puzzles were decently challenging while intuitive, rather than being frustratingly obtuse, which is a good plus."

Going 2 people co-op? but a random joins? Just rehost the game for 3 people this person could be a great teammate! Yet some people love to be rude and kick people on join. Just a small tip if you join a random game wich does not have private in the title try hitting that enter button and typing ""Do you mind if I join?"" or ""Are you waiting on a friend?"" in chat. Or you hit some person that will instantly kick you (He is probarely waiting on a friend don't blame him for being rude) , Or you will hit somebody that says ""Yes I am waiting on a friend could you please leave?"" , Or you somebody (rarely but funny) that says yes (like in as i mind) And you tell him you will leave but then he is like don't. (He missread or something) :D and then he turns out to be a really good teammate. Or another rare encounter where this person is again really polite (totally like the last one haha) and he lets you join :). If you find one of these you will have alot of fun.

Lags, disconnects, twitching, stuttering. Game is nowhere near complex or pretty enough to lagg on my beast of a machine.3. UI and lack of options. There are just too many things wrong with the UI, the way you setup things, game needs more solid visual identifiers, especially during the hectic missions.4. Polish. This game badly needs one. So many bugs, from visual ones where you can't even see because of the ""SPACE SPACE SPACE"" all over the screen, to glitches and teleports.5. Lack of skill variety. It might seem that there is a ton of skills, but many are just plain bad, plus many are about creating marks on enemies, with very little skills to remove them often enough.TLDR -> If you want a 4man coop top down twin stick brawler, buy and play Gauntlet, that's a solid example of a polished, smooth game."

76561197979643793,Not Recommended,249990,11865299,"Posted: 25 August, 2014",all,RustyRaven,"I really hate having to recommend against getting this game. I really wanted to like it but the experience the game gave just declined over the course of 14 hours. Let's start from the beginning.I bought this game pretty much right after it came out in 2013 and played it with 2 other friends. The net-code was unstable at launch which made it extremely difficult to get online co-op games (one of the main selling points) to work. When it did work though it was great entertainment. However, an unstable multiplayer was not the only mechanical issue I ran into and I crashed several times. Add numerous bugs and you have a less than stellar experience. A year later I picked up the game to finish it and while the net-code has gotten better it's still wonky and there are still bugs throughout, in fact the last boss fight of the game was more or less ruined as the big bad evil guy crapped out on me and was stuck in his walking cycle unnable to attack.Even with those mechanical flaws I still managed to have a good time but at the halfway mark of the game things just go down hill. See the game is structured a lot like an old Crash Bandicoot game (the second one to be exact). The game is split into worlds that has a series of levels along with a boss fight. Every level has 3 crystals to obtain. The first is obtained by simply beating the level, the second by completing a challenge tied to the level and finally a crystal based on completion time.The structure works really well and here's why: The game is a mix of RPG, Hack 'N' Slash and light Puzzle elements. Your character has active abilities, passive abilities and a special ability tied to each of the 4 classes (Hammer charges over time, bow can be charged manually, shield blocks etc.). However, in order gain new abilities you need to get crystals by beating levels. This creates a very real incentive to complete levels several times to pick up all the crystals.This brings us to the levels themselves and the puzzle element. Throughout the game you'll be escorted by Balfus a flying orb that might as well have been called Navi. Balfus has a lot of quips throughout the game and he happily chats away whenever he's given the chance and becomes real grating, real fast. Especially when constantly replaying levels to get those final crystals. Now the levels are structured so that you need Balfus to activate several items and objects by making him fly into them and for the first half of the game it's great fun to play with all the different objects in the world and there are some really creative puzzles in there. Like I said though, at the half way point it seriously starts to feel like you're simply going through the motions and things become repetitive just like Balfus' endlessly repeating lines.Another few gripes I feel deserve mentioning are the bosses whom have way to much health for their own good, seriously they are ♥♥♥♥ing sponges soaking damage like high-end kleenexes. The mark system which adds extra damage from abilities and basic attacks don't do enough to quickly wear down bosses at a reasonable rate and the boss levels which are supposed to be epic become tedious. The fact that the invisible creatures can only be spotted by Balfus and the fact there's only one Balfus and most likely more than one player it is aggrivating to kill just one, especially when they have enough health to soak several fully marked abilities. I could go on but I think I've made my point.In conclusion, I feel really bad for not recommending the game because I know this is the first game by the dev team and I know they worked really hard on it, but it just lacks polish and the player-experience is not optimal as a result. If you really want to play this game, get it on sale."
76561197973957094,Not Recommended,249990,11888477,"Posted: 27 August, 2014",all,[2FN] Solrentei,"If you want a good coop game then look elsewhere!Where to start? Want deep character customization? Too bad! Pick between four set characters (if a buddy grabs your favorite character, you have to play as a different one) with only one weapon set per character. while you can certainly upgrade their abilities and switch between a few special powers per character, its hardly in depth enough to make you feel like you have the ability to make important changes to your character to augment to your own playing style. And with zero loot in the game you aren't allowed to even optimize your character's gear in any way.Howabout the maps? Well, don't play this game expecting long sprawling dungeons, each level is more of a small arena with waves of enemies and little puzzles to solve. And when I mean arena I literally mean a smallish circular map where enemies will run in from doorways on the outside as well as from a few spawners. Its been extremely difficult to connect with friends, but when working the teamwork required to get through these levels is simple, but enjoyable enough (though it is a simple button masher) when played in coop, however that leads me to the greatest problem of this game in my opinion:When playing coop with friends with each of you on DIFFERENT computers, you are still forced to share the camera as if playing a couch coop with your buddies on the same screen. This can lead to anything from mild annoyance to intense frustration while playing. I can think of nothing more frustrating while trying to play this game then when my character is pushed off the screen because my friends are on the other side of the screen, and I am now forced to fight blindly or ask my friends to stop what they're doing and come back to my side of the arena. This problem might not be as frustrating when played with just 1-2 other friends, but if you get a full group of four together you'll run into this problem often. Its possible this has been fixed, though the fact that you were ever forced (no pun intended) to play this way in the first place is ridiculous!In terms of replayability, there is no randomness to this game, or any abundance of places you might of missed to explore. The game's main sense of replayability comes in the fact that each arena playthrough is timed, and ranked among others. The incentive being to replay the arena to try and get a better score.There's a reason why most of the people reviewing this game don't make it past twenty hours of game time... However, that being said, if this sounds like the type of game you want to play then by all means give it a whirl. Just don't be fooled into thinking that this game will be at all like an in depth rpg dungeon crawler. If you're looking for that type of game look elsewhere."

I would like to play using skills I enjoy, not skills that I must use to progress. That is another very poor design choice.My last gripe is that I don't feel like the game has much replayability.

The challenges that my friends and I faced has caused us the necessary frustration but the possibility of completing it has kept us at it. We are 70% past the game and honestly, my only wish were that it could be longer as we do love the game.The upside are the stages which are initially simple but you can opt to do the challenges which are much harder and have forced our team to use special set-ups in our attempt to conquer them. A fond way to think of it would be like a 10-25 man dungeon raid you would experience in some of the MMO's but that your team was reduced to 4, including you. Although you can play it single player, it is a much better game to play with friends and I would say your enjoyment rises exponentially with each friend you play with.The downside is that the game is relatively short, if you play without the challenges, you can easily complete in maximum of 1-2 days?This is one of the most challenging games and its still worth every cent."

Definitely not worth the $14.99 sticker price.Pros: Different weapon sets are useful for different levels, decent co-op play. Low cost on sale.Bosses you beat become toned down normal enemies in following levels, which introduces some neat mechanics in mundane combat.cons: Almost no replayability. Progression requires you to beat levels under a timer and while adhering to generally more difficult challenges, so look forward to playing all of them several times as you go through the story.Low variety of enemies. You'll see the same ones every single level.Puzzles are highly simplistic. Out of 20 story levels only a handful aren't painfully obvious. About half of challenges are super easy to get and you'll end up reaching them just by playing the level, the rest are frustrating and include a strong element of luck requiring you to replay the level multiple times.Stunlock for days. Not all classes have invincibility frames, and several enemy types can pin you against the wall or dogpile you and stunlock you to death. The completely invisible enemies that attack from invis without breaking it only add to this, as they make some attacks legitimately unavoidable.Camera is terribad. It has a maximum zoom and a fixed angle, combined with all the knockbacks its not unsual to have people stuck offscreen.Almost no multiplayer scene: less than five games at a time, coming off of an 85% off sale.

Pressing a button on the controller causes it to be overlayed with a ""NO_BUTTON"" text label* Unable to select a two-player co-op with a controller, only 3 or 4. Workaround: select with a mouse* Pressing ""A to join"" on a second controller causes a player to be addded to the game twice controlling two characters at once. Yes, it's as dumb as it sounds. Workaround: Force 2 player coop (see item 1)* Once a proper two player coop is selected, each player has different controller setup (and they are not configurable). Player 1 has ""fire"" set to RT, and Player 2 has ""fire"" set to D-pad right.* I can't enter the settings menu from the main menu using a controller* A lot of pop-ups have placeholder messages for ""No translation for language"" even though the rest of the game is in EnglishThis is far as I got before I gave up.

It is challenging because everyone can control it equally, and often all players need to work together and coordinate positioning and timing to complete levels.The levels themselves are challenging, but easily doable with a little effort. The challenge gems on the levels, which unlock extra abilities for all players, are quite difficult at times and give the game a much harder goal for those who want it.Each level is unique and fresh, and the game continues to throw new content at the players from start to finish. This makes for an extremely fun game that is made even better when playing with friends.Cons:For no apparent reason, some people are unable to join certain game lobbies to play with friends. The only solution I've found to this is to continually remake and have different parties host until it happens to work. This usually takes 5-10 minutes of remaking games for everyone to be able to play together.Once a level is loaded, there's a chance some players will be unable to move. Sometimes this is fixed by simply restarting the level which takes only a few seconds, but sometimes this bug just won't go away until the entire game is remade, which can make the process take several minutes, especially if there's a connection bug.For an unknown reason, some players will not be rewarded gems for completeing the level in game. Because the game will not let anyone progress until all members have equipped all their abilities, this can cause major problems early in the game. Fortunately, all gems are rewarded upon making a new game. Once again, this is easily done if everyone can connect to the lobby without any issues, but if you run into the connection bug I mentioned, it can delay your gaming experience even more.The first two hours I spent in this game, I probably got to play for half an hour. Now that workarounds to most of the bugs have been figured out by my friends and I, it's not so bad. The bugs are annoying, but easily fixed if you have the time to spare. For most games, these bugs would be a deal breaker for me, but because the gameplay itself is so enjoyable and unique, I don't mind. I highly recommend this game, but be aware of the issues it has before going into it."

It's been a while since my friends and I have had a good co-op game to play together and we've spent the majority of the past week playing it non-stop. My OCD/completionist nature kicks into high gear for the challenge and time objectives of each mission. I cannot move on to the next trial without completing its predecessor in its entirety.

And it's the best part of this game: THE CHALLENGES!

Also, don't go for the full price, maybe at 25-33% at least... ?Maybe and certainly nice in coop, but doing it solo was so challenging BUT FEELS SO DAMN GOOD BY THE END OF IT!

Yet challenging it never gets unfair for there is a way to master the tasks given. And - I guess it is the most important fact - it is impossible to win the game without your team. This is not a lame phrase but virtually the truth because sometimes you have to solve ridles while timing your movement avoiding death traps and combating enemies meanwhile. There is so much going on that you have no time to pause for you'll get exhausted. Often your friends are the reason for failing or dying which in many cases is the reason for failing.I guess casual gamers will be frustrated very fast but everyone who loves a challenging coop will love this one. Give it a try, it is worth the effort.Pros+ 4x Unique characters where no one is useless+ Very broad diversification of level design+ Great ideas and good humor+ You have to solve riddles by yourself with nearly no tipps given+ Balfus (players of the game will know why)+ Challenging but not unfair (may seem so at first but it is not, watch yt vids if you do not believe it)+ Extremly well balanced+ Fast matches of only some minutes (yet you will play for longer I'm sure)Cons- No double characters in the team- Skilltrees are somehow small and many skills do not seem usefull (or my team is just dumb)- The great game controls sometime need a really perfect timing- Some more monster types would have been niceOverall:Give it a try!

It has four very different and very fun classes, which you can switch between any time you want.  You can play it solo, or you can go co-op and play with both friends and strangers.  The game used to be almost entirely unplayable, as there were so many connection issues that it was impossible to play with others and this is an extremely co-op oriented game.  However, since then the devs have pretty much completely rewritten all network related code and spent a huge amount of time bug hunting, which shows a tremendous amount of dedication as this is the first and only game created by a new and very small company.  However, it did take a while for them to update it considering how much they had to fix, so many people who initially played the game have since forgotten it and not updated the reviews they left half a year ago, so the game's Steam rating is fairly inaccurate.If you like challenging, co-op based games that involve both problem solving and skill on an intense yet doable difficulty curve, I highly recommend this game.  However while you can play it casually, you will not get much out of it nor will you get very far, so if that's what you're looking for do NOT buy it."

,Recommended,249990,7781270,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,okram2k,"Newly released on steam is a new indy action rpg game called Forced. It’s available for $14.99 and caught my eye. If you have not already seen it, check out the story of BetaDwarf. The makers of the game living together on a shoe string budget for the last few years (even eating together to save money) in order to fulfill their dreams is probably reason enough to plop down $15 on the game but luckily there’s more than just that to give it a try.Forced puts you in the role of a gladiator, who’s tribe is more or less only in existence to breed warriors who take on deadly challenges for the enjoyment of others. Now that you’re old enough to fight or whatnot you are sent into the halls of trials to await your destiny. Which is probably going to involve you being killed almost immediately. After a basic tutorial the game opens up into a series of challenges you can run each in growing complexity and difficulty. You have four classes of gear to chose from and the more challenges you complete the more skill points you unlock to become more and more powerful.As you get yourself into the game you will notice quite quickly, this game is HARD. But it’s not hard in a cheap OMG WHAT WAS THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!?!? sort of way. No it’s hard because it is unforgivably difficult. The game doesn’t hold any punches and it hits you hard from early on and never lets up. You know how there are those crazy people who are addicted to spicy foods and must find the absolutely most spicy thing around? (Usually because they are addicted to endorphins) Well this game is like eating the spiciest of peppers with no milk to wash it down with. To a lot of us we’ll spit it out, frustrated by the game’s infuriating difficulty but there are some who will absolutely love it.Here’s the thing, with easy games you get less triumph from your successes. Sure they might give you a constant supply of ‘oh nice’ over and over again but eventually it doesn’t really feel like much accomplishment. Forced on the other hand is so brutally difficult that after failure after failure after failure when you finally succeed oh it feels so succulent, so sweet, so amazing. The game manages to walk a very fine line of being so difficult that success is amazingly rare while also giving you just enough hope that you might possibly figure out how to succeed, just maybe.One of the things I really like about Forced is the way they handle character progression. Yes there are four distinct classes to play but you can switch freely between them before each challenge. Also you can pick your skills freely each challenge as well. This makes choosing the class and what skills vitally important before each challenge as some are better at certain things than others. It’s also important to get familiar with each class as opposed to only playing one as you might be unnecessarily handicapping yourself in a challenge. The classes are fairly unique with a defender, a ranger, a brute heavy melee, and a faster more finesse melee. Each have their own weakness and strengths and if you are struggling with a challenge it might be time to switch up the classes or skill load out.Each challenge has three crystals (or skill points, really) available to be earned. The first is earned by simply defeating the challenge. A second is offered for doing some sort of optional skill mission and a third for completing the challenge in a certain amount of time. The more crystals you unlock the stronger your character gets, which should, in theory, make it easier to do more challenges. I like the skill system with active and passive abilities to chose from and having more options unlocked as you acquire more crystals. You are also able to have more skills active the as you go along, greatly increasing your character’s potency. Combat is also fairly smooth. Your character moves independently of the direction you’re aiming and combat uses a ‘mark’ gimmick. Each time you hit an enemy with your normal attack increases the effect of your special attack up to five times. So it’s best to prep enemies with normal attacks then hit them with specials, rinse and repeat. It’s fairly straight forward and works pretty well while adding extra tension as you try to get five marks on a big baddy before you unleash your awesome special attack.Now Forced is not without its flaws. I imagine the game would be really fun to play online (or really frustrating depending on who you play with.) But alas after trying a few times I was unable to connect to a game. I suspect the issue is probably with my firewall or something but just frustrating when internet connectivity gets in the way (seriously, why can’t online games just *work* these days?) Also if you change the controls the menus and options don’t update to match your custom control scheme which can get a wee bit annoying when trying to navigate menus or load out your skills. Also I’m not sure if it’s a big complaint or not but there is no loot in the game as the only rewards you get for completing quests are skill unlocking crystals. This can add even more frustration when you’re trying to unlock extra crystals and are unable to beat a challenge fast enough. I guess it is just how I am but darn-it I like loot!The game certainly looks a lot better than most indy games I’ve played recently. And everything is fairly smoothed and well polished. The challenges offer a fairly good variety and do a great job of mixing combat and puzzles. I can tell that the developers have put their heart and soul into the product and even though it is probably too difficult for me I can still appreciate their work. And it just feels so good to finally get a victory on a challenge that kicked my♥♥♥♥♥five times in a row! If you love a good challenge, get this game.

The foundation of the game  is sort of like Gauntlet, a  top down game where you pick a class and then mow down mobs and move through the battle areana.But, fun as that is, that's not the point of the game. Each level has a puzzle or objective. Some of these are pretty tricky, and not only do you have to figure them out, but then you have to somehow execute that plan while still dealing with the monsters and fire being thrown at you. So, imagine solving group puzzles and tossing balls back and forth, all while trying to survive wave after wave of fairly difficult enemies.In any case this game makes for great co-op play, and while difficulty curve starts out gentle, it gets really high. This isn't a game you can just breeze through without a thought, it's a fun little co-op challenge."

It is best to be played as a four person experience but displays more of a challenge on single player.

Videogames are notorious for poor writing and even worse voice acting but it's been a while since I've come across one as incessantly annoying as FORCED.What about the gameplay? It's not bad... more or less a Gauntlet clone with light RPG elements and a few interesting puzzles. The levels are mostly bland and forgettable. Often they will include interactive elements that are neither self-evident nor properly explained by the game's everpresent, never useful narrator. (Think Navi from Ocarina with no grasp of the English language.)Considering I bought it for a dollar, I wouldn't exactly call this game a waste of money.

You will seriously molest this game. If you're not into those things, maybe not so much; but it's well put together and if you've got the scratch and nothing else to do with it, it's still not a bad thing to have on hand."

Each level has three gems you can earn (very crash bandicoot-esque), which are used to unlock new skills.  One gem is earned simply for beating the level, one is a time trial, and the last is for completing a unique challenge.  This adds extra challenge and longevity to the game."

I played the campaign single player for quite a while and liked it, but my friends and I quickly tired of the multiplayer co-op which is simply more of the same. Overall I'm happy with it, but buying it just before it dropped in price for the Summer sale was kinda a burn."

Love the guide, and the tutorials throughout. Gameplay controls could be a little faster. Weapons choices are nice, I enjoy switching off between them and checking out how they do in each phase. I'd say it is worth checking out for casual play."

Bought the 4 pack during the last steam sale and had a blast going through the levels. Each level is a cleverly designed arena with unique challenges. While difficult to beat the first time, each level also has a time trial and a bonus objective to complete. Beating levels, clearing under a time limit, and completing the bonus objective provides gems which unlock upgrades. Upgrades are unlocked at gem levels, so you can switch between any of the 4 playable characters at any time. Almost all the upgrades are useful and unique, so different players can have very different styles even with the same character.My only complaint about the game is that one of the later levels appears to be bugged in multiplayer and can't be completed."

I enjoyed playing the beginning levels with my friends, but we quickly found out that in a nutshell....this game is still an unfinished and unpolished product, despite being out for a good while now.It doesn't take long to get to a level with what I consider game-breaking mechanics that just doesn't make it worthwhile to even try anymore. The frustrating thing is that it would have been really easy to implement something to fix these - like a dodge mechanic for example - and yet that was never done. It's like they released a good idea for a game that they never bothered playing or testing themselves, and then just left it alone.Therefore I recommend saving your money for a good coop game that a developer actually polishes and tests to make sure it is balanced and fun all the way through."

,Not Recommended,249990,31797722,Posted: 16 May,all,CorruptFate,"I want to like Forced, when you can get the game working it is fun to play with some friends. This game has so many problems when you are trying to set up multi player.My Steam name is to long for their lobby, so I would need to use the keyboard to delete some of the characters (it wouldn't let me do that on the controller) and I couldn't even click the start button with the controller anyway. That's not a big deal, but then gets into a loop where it detects a controller that is plugged in and asks if I would like to use that. If I tell it no, I am stuck with the keyboard, if I say yes I need to go right back to the keyboard to delete characters.Even after that point we would have trouble getting all 4 people into the lobby as a single person could fill two slots with one controller (it doesn't tell you what controller goes to what person) so when you start the game one person can't do anything while a single person is playing as 2+ characters. This also had a problem where the controls could be split between controllers and one person would move while the other attacked.When we finally were able to get everyone into the game we were never able to get the game to recognize everyone inputs. We had 4 people each playing with controllers and on the occasions when we all could get into the game one person needed to attack with the right Dpad (rather than right trigger) and another couldn't use their second ability. And with the default controls it's rather easy to leave the game by mistake (Y being menu rather than the start button).We did look online and went though all the controller set up instructions they have posted but that didn't seem to change a thing, I even posted on the discussion and waited a few days before writing this but no response from the devs or community (the game has been out for a few years now, but I hoped it would at least get a dev response). At this point my play time says 3 hours, but 2.25 of those have been trying to resolve these issues. These seem to be common problems for people and I don't see beta dwarf helping anytime soon.TLDR;Cool gameplay and It would be good for local multiplayer, but good luck ever getting it to work."

Balfus, an orb, is the only one helping them. Also, he is the key to solve many problems while fighting and clearing objectives.Refering to the first sentence, I want to point out why I personally think so. There are three major things to mention. Communication, timing and tactics! This is what you need to successfully play this game.Grab your friends and play!"
,Recommended,249990,34639386,Posted: 31 August,all,DJHarmony,"This is one of those games that I knew going in would be challenging, and I'll say, it's that good kind of challenging. The game seems like it's out to kill you and belittle you, but in a way that makes sense and adds to the fullfilment of doing well. The controls are pretty darn easy to get the hang of and while the enemies can sometimes be a bit overwhelming you will find that there are easy ways to deal with all of them as time goes on. The story isn't exactly the most original in terms of these Guantlet style games, but it doesn't need to be. The bosses you face all feel legitimately threatening and your guide is probably one of the most useful in gaming history, used to solve puzzles and activate certain power-ups/healing fountains. The feeling of being the underdog who surpasses all trials is a feeling that every gamer should get to feel."
