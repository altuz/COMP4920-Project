,Recommended,250030,7549296,"Posted: 2 November, 2013",all,Bastwood,"Short and relatively charming adventure in the vein of Samorost and Botanicula. No inventory management, no verbs, no dialogue, just clicking hotspots on the screen in the right order. Nice animation and graphics, soothing music and the puzzles occasionally provide a challenge. Sadly the challenge is more about trying to figure out what you should be doing than actually solving the problem itself - the age-old Myst™ curse. You find yourself spending lots of time flipping colored switches with no concept of what you're supposed to accomplish.The story doesn't really make much sense or seem to be going anywhere. When it finally does the game just abruptly ends, and the said anticlimax just seems to underline the already short length of the game. If you've already played all Amanita Design games and still want more, then and only then consider Lilly Looking Through. Lilly doesn't quite fall in the same league, but is pleasant enough to waste a couple of hours with."

I like the style, but there are two things that make me not recommend this game.a) The ending is very abrupt, and is not an ending. It's like an episodic game, but there is no second episode. The story is not complete, and ends with a giant cliffhanger.b) The puzzle mechanics involve unskippable cutscenes that can be at times very tedious. Three to five second animations between every step make trial-and-error guessing of what you're supposed to do very exhausting"

The puzzles are hard per se just not well explained, I spemt a lot of time just randomly clicking during the color changing ones with no clue what I was doing. There is practacally no plot and game is unfinished in my opinion, maybe there wil be a patch so we can get some closure. It really is sad because I feel the idea of mini time travel is great but wasn't really used much a little under half  the game(which isn't long) you don't have use of the goggles.

Two hours for $10 is rediculous no matter how much fun with NO replay value.The storyline is non-existant and does not even 'end' when you finish it, making me believe there was a second chapter or something (which I believe there is not).There are no side quests, no mini puzzles, no achievements.

The art is fantastic and the gameplay mechanics suit perfectly.   I enjoyed this game from start to finish.Lilly Looking through is about the tale of a brother and a sister.  You don't know where they are from, where they are, or why the world is like what it is.   Some may consider this lazyness, but I however, find that this actually helps emphasis the characters themselves.   They're sweet and charming.  Throughout the game the single minded child like nature of the characters is evident and enhanced by the simplicity of the environments of the world.Even though the art style is simple and beautiful the puzzles this game present can be quite cunning.  Given the short length of the game the difficulty curve is quite steep. However, the basic premise of most of the puzzles makes solving them challenging, but never threatening.  It doesn't aim to increase the difficulty by providing lots of places to click, or by confusing you.My one warning with this game is that you cannot rush it.  You must not rush it.  To fully enjoy it you must be willing to enjoy the art, ask yourself what has happened and why.  This game rewards freedom of imagination.  If you want a game which fully explains itself this is not the game for you.  However, if you are willing to let a game absorb you, if you are willing to let your imagination be free then this game becomes an experience full of joy and emotion."

The adventure is over far too quickly but you will fall in love and enjoy every minute of it.Lilly Looking through is a point and click puzzle game. This game is a successful kickstarter and greenlight story and for good reason. There is simply not enough of these types of games. It reminds me of games like Monkey Island, only there is no inventory and every level is its own individual puzzle.The puzzles are not ment to be hard, simply obstacles. Although, the color puzzles through me for a loop and I find myself asking “what am I supposed to be aiming for?” a few times. Even after beating the game once I still found myself a bit confused and just clicking around until things lined up.The game’s art and music are very well done. It is easy to tell that the focus of the game is indeed the atmosphere. The music keeps you calm even through some frustrating parts and mixed very well with the art direction.  The art is designed to look like a painting and it succeeds. I found myself captivated by the environment and beauty of this game.The story is simplistic but enough to set up the adventure. Lilly is trying to save a young boy, Row, as he is swept away by a mysterious red scarf. It is not much to go on, and exists only to move things forward. I actually found myself forgetting about Row and asking more questions about what happened to the world that Lilly is a part of.I would recommend this game looking for an experience. This game is far, far too short to satisfy anyone looking for a time waster. If you want to kill time, go play COD: Ghost multiplayer."

The puzzles are not that hard to figure out but are pretty tedious to complete. A lot of guess work and going back and forth between switches. The game is also a bit to short for my likings. Normal price might not be fully worth it but its worth a go when its on sale.Note: Appearantly a GTX580 is not a good card to play this game.

,Recommended,250030,33538220,Posted: 14 July,all,Moonlight,"A very sweet little game with some interesting puzzles and really gorgeus visuals. It has a simple story; Lilly encounters an odd scarf-looking piece of cloth, which springs to life and takes her brother away. With the help of her glasses, which teleports her to another time when she wears them, she has to follow the scarf and save her brother. It's concise, never wastes your time and unlike some other adventure games, all the puzzles actually make some sense. It's a really good example of how to make a game short and sweet, and actually use that to the game's advantage by keeping only the really good elements, with no need to ""fill"" with unnecessary content. This makes for a slim and very well executed game overall, with a good interaction between premise, drive and pacing.However, as many other reviews have said, the ending is quite abrupt. I think we get enough information to imagine what happens next, but it is quite a cliffhanger. This might put some people off, but in my opinion the journey is good enough to make it worth it in the end. Well worth the buy."

The color themed puzzles require a bit more than the standard ""combine this item and that one to move on"" problems of this genre.

,Not Recommended,250030,30125904,Posted: 23 February,all,TheKarpuk,"First off, know that this game ends without a real resolution, and there's almost complete silence from the developers about creating a sequel.Beyond that, I originally bought Lilly Looking Through for the same reason I buy a lot of adventure games: compelling artwork and interesting characters. While Lilly delivers on that score, there's some pretty heavy issues beyond that.If you're looking for a lot of narrative, this is not what you're looking for.If you're looking for a lot of character development, same deal.If you're looking for a lot of the conveniences of modern adventure games, look elsewhere.Lilly Looking Through presents almost each screen as a puzzle box that needs to be solved in order to move on to the next screen. It's very rigid in this fashion. The thing is, that's the entire game. I'd be fine with that, accepting the game for being more limited than expected, except for that fact that it makes this process of trial and error very cumbersome.Lilly's movement involve long, languide animations. Lilly is slow, as you'd expect a child dealing with these devices to be. But when you're dealing with a ton of repetition, trial and error, and experimentation, these unskippable animations become a bit of a nightmare. There are adventure games from 20 years ago that let you skip cinematics and animations that you've already viewed, so there's not really a good argument for its absence here, unless the creators just hated the idea of you not caring.And the saves only occur at the beginning of each screen, something I discovered on accident when I quit the game. It's just another thing hurting ease of use.Lilly is one of those failed adventure games where watching a Let's Play on Youtube would be preferrable to playing it."
,Recommended,250030,27200430,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Whisle,"This review takes into account that i bought this game under full knowledge that it's a very short game. Also, it was on sale.Lilly Looking Through is a classic Point and Click adventure game with very classic puzzles (do things in right order, color puzzles, ...). I guess that's why i had trouble on a few on them.Very early on you acquire an item that lets you ""switch between worlds"". This mechanic is well integrated into the puzzles. The music is very serene and the animations are cute. Sadly it doesn't scale all that well to higher resolutions (i'm using a 1440p monitor).My other gripes about the game are the very long, non-abortable/interruptable animations. You often need to click on the same objects a lot in a row to solve some of the puzzles and the animations - while cute - can last quite a long time. This sadly got me frustrated quite a bit.Also, it's not clear what the game wants you to do sometimes in order to progress. You clearly have things to click on, but to what end? You almost always find that out after the fact.Otherwise it's a quite enjoyable, short little puzzler!Spoiler? About the ending:The ending is quite open and kinda hints at a sequel."

I’m a bit reluctant to call it an adventure game as the game itself has little to no story.Now the artwork from screen to screen is adorable, beautiful even, the animation is great, however they can become a little bit out-drawn at times. The music on the other hand is simply stunning and ads a lot of mystery and whimsicality to the game.When it comes to the puzzles, I had a hard time figuring out what I was supposed to do every once in a while, but at the same time I liked the challenge of solving them. As you often have to think outside of the box. I particularly liked the use of Lilly’s (or Lilly’s brother’s) goggles.The characters don’t have any particular background story, which is a bit disappointing, but it is understandable, when you take into account the time you use to play through the game. Speaking of time. As the game is relatively short, I expected a closed ending at the least, but alas, that did not happen. The choice of ending confused me and made me think: “That’s the ending? That’s it?” The open ending made me think they’re planning a follow-up to this game, but in all honesty, if the next game is the same length as this one, I very much doubt I’ll buy it. The way the ending looked, it seemed that this is just ½ of a whole game. The latter is just speculation on my part though.In the end, this is just an experience game made to set a mood and impression. Don’t get me wrong. By describing this is as just an experience game, I want to express that those wanting to play this game, and expect a plot and a story on the same level as the art, animation and sound will most likely be disappointed. Most of the short playtime is made up of puzzles that, once figured out are very easily solved the second time around.  Seeing as it's both short and without a story, all you’re really left with is a short time with a feeling of whimsy that's mostly filled by puzzles made somewhat tedious due to slow animations between motions.When it comes to the price, I think that 9€ is a reasonable price for a game like this. I’ve seen games far worse than this going for a lot more, but I don’t think I’d go as far as paying extra for the “deluxe edition”.Overall, I’d say this is a good game. What I’ve enjoyed the most in this game would be the underwater puzzles/ cave puzzle. Again, I really love the art, the music and last, but not least the puzzles plus the use of the goggles in the game. It definitely is worth a play-trough, but that is about it. As much as I’d love to recommend buying this game, I still feel something is lacking before you could actually say that it is a 100% finished product. I’d say the game is entitled to get ½ cookie out of 1 whole cookie :)"

A number of puzzles, particularly the colour puzzles, are very unclear in terms of what one needs to do. Especially when combined with point 1, it makes the game far longer than it should (without the excessive amounts of animation, I think this game would only be ~1.5hrs of gameplay).4. The story just ends abruptly. It feels as if the game was barely started before it was slapped onto Steam.All in all, it may look good (which is more than I can say for May's Mysteries: The Secret of Dragonville), but looking past the eye candy, it's an insufferable experience that will leave you feeling very unsatisfied (and with buyer's remorse)."

The pacing of the game was calm, and I could explore the lovely, painted world at my leisure. I could wander through as an awe-struck six-year-old and just soak in the beauty. The puzzles made sense, and the Community page has hints and explanations for the more complex ones, if you need that nudge. I would highly recommend Lilly Looking Through to anyone who just wants a world to wonder at."
,Recommended,250030,8581370,"Posted: 5 January, 2014",all,Gnome,*Gnome Seal of Approval*Cute little point and click adventure game. You play as Lilly and try to save your little brother as he is swept away with the wind. You navigate through the world and solve puzzles with the help of some enchanted glasses that transport you back and forth to an alternate time or reality. It is a fairly short game and I failed to see the logic in some of the puzzles. It's not hard though. Chances are you'll get through it after a couple of hours. Cute and nicely animated.

Still, it's worth the price and a developer worth watching."

The idea of time shift is not new and was much exploited in other hidden object games. Two actors is also not new, e.g. in ""Brothers - A tale of two sons"" it was used far more actively. So, not a groundbreaker but overall a very entertaining game. Graphics is fine. The interface is a bit annoying until you get accustomed to it, which happens quite fast. Hope for the second part."

My grandparents told me that my fathers cousin was the head designer of the game alongside his wife and i had to instantly grab the game when it came up to play something that my family had created. And i for one absoluetly adored this game. The colors were great, the backgrounds were great, the main characters were easily lovable and fun to play along with, and the music was a perfect fit for the relaxing style of the game. To anyone considering to pick up this game i would recommend it for all people who are looking for a good button click search game. The fact that no talking is even used in this game is great as well allowing for people of all languages to enjoy this game as much as the next group. I am proud to say that the people who designed this game our in my family and I will always tell others to try out this game if they want to have a fun and relaxing game to play."

Enjoyable, but way too short with a cut-off ending (presumably open for sequel?). In general the puzzles weren't too taxing. Unfortunatley by the last few scenes the difficulty was trying to find the objective of the puzzle, which led to a lot of random button pushing to see what happened. With the animiation of each action taking 3 or 4 seconds this got tiresome quickly.Get it on sale - for 2 hours gameplay full price isn't worth it."

The ending really isn't an ending and the game seems unfinished. It's good to play if you get it included in a Humdle Bundle or it's reduced to a few bucks, otherwise not worth the money."

It's short, not too difficult, yet an enjoyable game if you like adventure and puzzle solving.  Most puzzles are solved by trying things out and noticing how what you did effected the other parts of the scene.  I admit I did have to get help on an underwater color/sound puzzle.

76561198016286140,Not Recommended,250030,24035938,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Healcannon,This game had 2 major problems that really made it hard for me to enjoy it. The first is the requirement to see every single animation 100x before you are allowed to do a new action. There is no clip to the end of the animation if you click again. This means any puzzle you are stuck on for an extended period of time is greatly enhanced by the sluggish pace of Lilly herself.My second issue is the puzzles themselves. On puzzles I was stuck on it was largely due to the fact it was unclear what you are actually trying to solve. It is annoying to have a secondary aspect of the puzzle being figuring out why you are doing an action or what you are trying to get the machine to accomplish. The hint box isn't always helpful either. Sometimes a blimp on it means you can just move there. Other times it means you can just move there as well as click again to do another action once you are already in the same spot.The game looked really pretty and the puzzles themselves were fun once you understood the goal of them. Maybe I am just bad at puzzle games but i'd like it a lot more if the objectives were more straight forward. I did manage to beat the entire thing while sadly only needing help for one of the first puzzles.
76561197994334839,Recommended,250030,24112757,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,dysphorya,"Lilly Looking Through is a sweet, short game that should take you 2-3 hours to complete.  I agree with most of the points raised in the negative reviews, however.  Furthermore, I was chagrined to find that the puzzles in the levels of the demo were more difficult than those later in the game -- as a result, after paying for the full game (which nicely unlocked the rest of the levels and kept my demo progress), I found that the remaining gameplay went by too easily and quickly.  Despite these considerations, I did wholly enjoy LLT for its casual, relaxing experience and recommend it for the following reasons and with the following cautions:Animations:Lilly, the boy (her brother?), and the creatures are all beautifully animated, and it is a joy to watch the great care that went into their movements.  The animations are reminiscent of the hand drawn Don Bluth style.  Note that if you're generally growing impatient, having to repeat many steps of a puzzle, or in a hurry to wrap up the game, the movements and gestures can turn puzzles into a painful grind, since there is no way to skip through them.Music and Sound:The music is gentle and soothing -- a light, synthesized symphonic background that, with the background and action sounds, help with immersion.  Everything is a good fit for the artistic style and game's pace.Mechanics:This is a slow game.  Lilly doesn't move quickly -- while this shows off the already-mentioned animation care, it becomes laborious in places that you have to repeat actions.  If you need her to pull a lever, you'll need to watch her walk to the lever, get into position, pull the lever, then move away from the lever, and walk back to her starting point.  This happens every time.  The only instance where I saw a mechanics shortcut was in a jumping puzzle:  on Lilly's first jump to a landing point, she kicked up some dust and sneezed.  It was cute, and the sneeze only happened on the first jump.  The game would have benefited from similar and even more ruthless trimming throughout.  Otherwise, because of the game's simplicity, the mechanics are pretty clear in most cases.  Actionable objects have only one (at most, two) options, and the cursor is obvious when searching for trigger areas.Puzzles:I did not struggle as much with the puzzles in LLT as I often do with other point-and-click games.  Be aware that, typical for its genre, there will be some solutions that are utterly arbitrary.  As you'll read in other reviews, color plays a big role in this game, and it can be bewilderingwhya particular color leads to a solution any more than another.  Despite this, the color logic itself is sound:  you'll need to be familiar with basic, additive color theory (e.g., blue + red = purple; therefore purple - blue = red).  I liked that the game is careful to introduce and train the player on these elements before moving into more complicated, multi-step color puzzles.  I found that the ""?"" button for hints was usually enough to get me through the tougher situations.Story:I found that the premise and plot are the biggest issues with the game as a cohesive unit.  The Store Page ""About This Game"" summary doesn't give the player much of a lead-in.  We're told, ""Help our heroine through a variety of enchanting environments brimming with magic and wonder, as she seeks to rewrite the past, change the present, and unlock the ultimate mystery.""  However, the game doesn't come close to this description -- you won't ""rewrite the past"" or ""unlock the ultimate mystery,"" and it's important to know this when going into LLT.  The only way this game works from a plot perspective is to take it at face value.  A little girl is looking for a little boy, and she must explore an environment where her magical goggles allow her to slip between and use elements of two universes/planes to ultimately find him.  Then just dive in and don't ask any questions.  A third character is inexplicably introduced in the last stage, and the game ends ABRUPTLY with no resolution.  And like other reviewers, I found this is one of the most abrupt endings I've ever seen.  From a plot perspective, there is absolutely no satisfaction at the conclusion of the game.  The developers took great care to eliminate as much written and spoken text as possible to create a unique gaming experience, but even the smallest paragraph at the beginning and between levels would have gone far to lower confusion and frustration.In conclusion, the ease and shortness of the levels/puzzles following the demo, the lack of a cohesive story, and the abrupt ending left me feeling mildly disappointed when the credits started rolling.  Overall, however, I had a lot of fun in this game, enjoyed the animations and music, and found that it was a wholly enjoyable way to casually pass a few hours.  I'd be greatly interested in new titles from this development team.  For those reasons, I do recommend LLT -- just be sure to start with the demo to see if this game's style and mechanics click with you."

76561198315832518,Recommended,250030,32836227,Posted: 26 June,all,rln.tonks,"Short. There's like 8 levels. And they are challenging, but they're not impossible. I would be stumped, take a break, and come back and figure it out. 2 hours (or so) over a 1 1/2 day period. The game itself is a mixture of The Silent Age and Detective Grimoire. Silent Age because you use her goggles to flip back and forward between two realities/time periods and the puzzles to solve. DG because of the art, interaction abilities and music. Overall this game seemed pretty plotless-there wasn't a major antagonist, and there was a weird grandpa-ghost for a hot second, but there was nothing to really solve. Just catch up with the brother, solve a couple more levels, and be left with the weirdest ending I've ever seen. Not a bad game, fun for older kids (because despite the charming art, the puzzles would stump any little tykes), and maybe young adults. Good art, relaxing music, challening puzzles that aren't so bad they make you want to rage quit. VERY logic based. Wouldn't be good for anyone colorblind, as they are color-oriented."
