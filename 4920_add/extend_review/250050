Killing yourself strategically is a unique concept for a game.Edit:  I've now beaten all levels, and it was a truly great game.  I loved continuing to unlock new silly hats and weapons.  I haven't yet beaten all the time and life challenges, so I'm sure that will provide plenty more playtime.  For a game I found out about through my discovery queue, I am thoroughly impressed.  I would strongly recommend this game to everyone who loves puzzlers and platformers."

If Netwon had played this game, the giants would be the bodies of your dead comrades.In this game, you control an army of knights in desperate search for the Cup of Life. However, it's a dangerous journey and many will die along the way. Fortunately, each knight has a better chance than the one before; not only because you've learned from his sacrifice, but because his body is now a helpful platform on top of those spikes, or is completing an electrical circuit to open that door, or is just enough a stool to help you reach that ledge. Jump, push, and die your way through 4 worlds full of puzzle-filled levels, leaving a huge body count in your wake.It's one of the most hilariously fun puzzle platformers I've ever played. Its gimmick seems like it would get old very quickly, but they keep finding new ways to keep it fresh and introduce new challenges. It's puzzles can be a bit on the easy side if you're a veteren at puzzle games, but the notion of having to die to progress adds a perspective of puzzle-solving not often seen in other games.All in all, it's a blast. A must-buy for platformer fans."

Very fun puzzle game and the twist of having to kill your knights off to solve levels is really fun. I think this is the first game I can remember where dying is actually fun and sometimes I can't help but laugh when I accidently jump into a swinging blade, or an incinerator. Overall, I'd highly recommend this game for someone who is looking for a relaxing puzzle game and who doesn't take themselves too seriously."
,Recommended,250050,10863238,"Posted: 27 June, 2014",all,Maxion,"As the trailer suggests, this game is a humorous cross between puzzle platformer and lemmings, where you take advantage of the deaths of your predecessors to progress through the different levels.With an unlimited number of knights at your disposal, you control one until it dies, then another, and so on, and on each try to die in a way that your corpse will be of some benefit to your next knight. But doing well at a level means using fewer knights (wouldn't want them to die in vain, right? ;)Progressing in the game uses more of your puzzle skills than your platforming skills, and for considering you will only be using 3-4 buttons, the game gets surprisingly complex.Completing the various levels and achievements feels reasonably satisfying, and it can be amusing to overcome any obstacle by throwing numerous knights at it in various ways.The game contains several references to other games, most of which I found quite amusing, but more than anything else I found myself laughing out loud at many of the messages describing how varyingly successful I had been at the end of each level."

(For example corpses getting stuck or moving/not moving when they should)+ A few levels come across as repetetive, but you'll find this less as the game progresses.+ The music may get on your nerves after a while.It's good.

How do you solve them? By killing your knights and using their corpses to navigate through the puzzle silly! Every Knight has their own funny and medieval name but they will all blur into one party of corpses as you solve the puzzle. There are even challenges on how fast you did it in time and how few corpses you leave behind.Pros:- Cutesy graphics- Lovely soundtrack- Loads of fun puzzles- Deathly HumourCons:- The music can be repetitive- Some of the levels are very similar and it's like going through the same level twiceMy Rating: 10/10

With so many games concentrating on the aspect of keeping your player alive this one does the 180 and you NEED death in order to succeed.Each knight is named just so that you can get the brief moment of attachment before you send him on his way to die in the name of winning.This company for being a small company knows what it means to value your and interact with players even before the game was made. They were at a local expo before the game came out and you could write a knight name you would hope to exist and even do death screams that could potentially be added to the game.10/10 company and game

,Recommended,250050,13731709,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,Kyleia,"Who thinks of something like this? Who sits around a table and says, ""Let's make a game where you use corpses to progress?"" I mean, if you pitched it to me, I'd tell you it's a silly idea. But someone did it. And it works - quite well.I am really enjoying Life Goes On. So far, I've spent around 3 hours with it, and I've finished a third of the game. You will finish it quicker, but I am a completionist so I'm trying to get the fewest deaths and the fastest times, and man, let me tell you it's not easy!The concept of the game is actually quite sound, and the execution is pretty good. In Life Goes On, you need the corpses of humorously, randomly named characters to succeed. It's not necessarily the corpses of your failures (although it certainly can AND WILL be...) - sometimes you need to strategically die to buzzsaws, spikes, and other such things to trigger traps and switches so you can open a door, turn off a flamethrower, get to a higher area, or just finish the level.The game only has one button - jump. (and of course, directional pad) There's no attack, or anything else. This doesn't get too boring though, because the graphics & music are quite nice. Also, the levels and challenges are varied enough that you aren't focused on the fact that you are just hitting jump the whole time.Speaking of levels and challenges, they are relatively easy to complete, but difficult to master. The levels are relatively short, most under a minute and a half, so you move through them pretty quickly, and they feel differing on the types of puzzles involved. There are three 'worlds' total. The game itself is pretty forgiving, because you have unlimited knights, but you can replay each level to try and get the best rating on both time, minimizing your deaths, and finding Jeff.Jeff. What do I say about Jeff? You'll meet this adorable looking fuzzball, wander over to pet him, and he'll eat you. Yup. You heard me. In every level. And just when you think you're safe... HE'S IN THE CREDITS TOO. Sorry. You'll have to learn to love Jeff.Don't forget about Jim. Who's Jim? Well, each time you die, the knight that spawns is randomly named (the name shows up at the bottom of the screen). Jim is quite prolific and has at least 40 family members (some variant of Jim or James), that have a random chance to spawn when you get a new knight. There's even an achievement for wiping them all out. Trust me, I'm working on it. Eventually, you'll take care of the problem at the source. There's an achievement for that too.All in all, I highly recommend Life Goes On and think that if you like puzzle or platforming games, this is a must-buy, even at regular price (which I feel is quite reasonable). My only complaint with the game is that it is quite short, and I would have liked to see more out of it. Regardless, it will not disappoint."

,Recommended,250050,10056614,"Posted: 8 May, 2014",all,toddhunter,"Death. It has always been something that is best avoided in video games. Also real life would be the other main place. But as Life Goes On, an indie puzzle game by Infinite Monkeys shows, sometimes it can be used to solve environmental physics based puzzles.The hook of this game is a little tricky to wrap your head around, but simple to understand once you see it in action. Basically you control an infinite number of little knights and want to get them to the golden chalice at the end of each level. To do so, you can respawn a knight whenever a death occurs and make use of the previous body to further your cause. For example, you might be faced with a spike pit which is too wide to jump over. In this case, simply jump a knight into the middle of it, respawn and use the lifeless body as a stepping stone to get to the other side (The game gives each character a name, but you'll never bother to read it).It is a base mechanics that works extremely well. If you played the demo (and you should) you would quickly have got into the swing of using your minions to get a little bit further each life. It is clever and the initial levels make great use of the different possibilities the mechanic presents. Unfortunately, like a lot of clever ideas it runs out of steam far too quickly.Life Goes on just doesn't have enough good variety to maintain your attention. By the end of the first set of levels you will have had your fill of the different types of puzzles and so it is a let down that the next set is more or less repeating things all over again. The levels get longer and the challenges more difficult, but really the game is just chaining the same challenges you have already faced over and over again into growing chunks. Worse, whenever a new mechanic is introduced, it tends to lean more towards frustration rather than fun, especially when compared to the very solid base (trying to avoid activating respawn points is never a fun time).To be fair, although the 3rd ""world"" on drags a lot, there are still a couple of memorable stages here and there. One in particular pays homage to a popular steam themed game and the ""final level"" in each group represents somewhat of a boss battle, that is much more fun to play through. If only these levels had been the norm, rather than the exception this review would be a lot more glowing. As it stands the game only shows glimpses of potential and innovation, perhaps a lesson for the developers next game (quality of puzzles over quantity please!).Mixing it up is the set challenge of beating the clock and set number of deaths for each level. You will also have a ""fuzzy"" creature to find in each level which will eat one of your knights. While this promises diversity, the reality is it just means you are beating the level three times with a slightly different focus. Sadly there doesn't appear to be much scope for earning all three in one run consistently and there is seemingly no payoff for doing so anyway.The rest of the package is well put together. The graphics are functional and the sound and music is nicely done. The menus work, but are a little uninspired (think ios style) and there is basically no story to drive you on. The environments are nice though and have a lot of good touches such as moving power cables. There isn't a lot of variety in the caverns, but later levels do at least provide a slightly different colour palette.In terms of gameplay, the knights themselves are perhaps a little inconsistent as platforms (you'll often try to jump on one and ""miss"") but this isn't something you can't adjust and plan for and there is a very low penalty for failure. The controls in general are tight and it is nice that the game automatically ""grabs"" you onto other knights so this is nowhere near as fiddly as it might have been.Is there enough content for the asking price? I'd still suggest that there is, at a push, but it is walking a very fine line (looking at 4-5 hours I would think). The base game here is so solid that I highly recommend everybody tries it, but the lack of ideas means even the demo might just be sufficient (or waiting for a deeper sale might be the best option).So ultimately a bit of a disappointment despite still being a solid game. But then, life always goes on."

,Recommended,250050,9857164,"Posted: 17 April, 2014",all,Corruleum,"I first played the demo months ago and instantly fell in love with this game.The full game did not fail to deliver.The whole concept of (literally) standing on the shoulders of those who came before is presented wonderfully. See a deathtrap? Die on it, then respawn and walk on your corpse. Switch that has to be held down? Die so that your corpse falls on it, then respawn and walk past. Et cetera, et cetera.The controls are a bit inaccurate at times, and will most likely leave you dying slightly more often than intended. Although since this game is all about sacrificing one knight to make a path for another, a few more corpses lying around aren't that much of a problem. (And if you're finding it difficult, a few more corpses aren't a problem at all.)The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, and make great use of switches, platforms, corpses, and checkpoints. The solution is always there, if you know where to look.The music is unintrusive, yet amazing. It fits perfectly into the game. The sound design, too, is brilliant. Everything just works together really well.There is tremendous replay value in this game, too. Times (and deaths) to beat, secrets to find, more knights to sacrifice... And if you want a quick game (or want to prune Jim's family tree further), there are no lengthy menus to keep you from killing knights. This is evident even in the demo. Ten minutes worth of content, and I had over an hour logged.There's also a great (if morbid) sense of humour present. The knights' death cries are hilarious, the names are generally overblown (and if they're not, it's funnier), and the victory screens... well, ""VICTORY is failure rounded up!"" is just one of the possible messages to recieve upon finishing a level. And then there's the credits of the demo.If you haven't played the demo yet, you should. Even if you know you want this game. The credits alone are worth it. Possibly the title screen as well. And if you're undecided, the demo is basically a slightly earlier version with less levels and slightly different graphics (mostly just checkpoints and the victory screen are different, really)."

I was surprised by how fun this game got with each new level and each new mechanic. The gameplay is very addictive and simple yet tons of fun and thoughtful.The pacing is great as each level offers carefully constructed puzzles that feel fresh rather then copied or repeated. As you get used to encountering a trap or puzzle mechanic the game adds new layers to keep you thinking!l*] The game is plain fun. Not a single complaint about it. The gameplay is solid and feels rewarding as you solve silly puzzles by sacrificing your oddly named loyal knights.The audio is pleasant, no annoying soundtrack or repetitive horrible sound effects that drive you insane.The visual style and graphics suit the game completely and are quite delightful.Appeals to casual gamers as well as those looking for a challenge as each level can be replayed with several objectives to try and accomplish including finding secrets, beating a level with the fewest 'lives' sacrificed and speed running. Completing all challenges for each level and earning the highest score/award can be quite challenging even for a hardcore gamer- but these objectives are all optional and are NOT required to continue to the next level.The length of the game so far is quite a bit more then I originally expected. After 3 hours I don't think I'm even at the half way point yet- I might be nowhere near it!In my 3 hours I've expirienced no stutter, long loading times, bugs, glitches or any annoyances. The game has run quickly and smoothly throughout, and I'm playing it at it's highest settings on a fairly cheap laptop that can't run AAA games.I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a game that can be played in short bursts or longer sessions, anyone looking for something non-serious and affordable."

As obstacles arise, you throw your knights at them in ways that invariably costs their lives in morbidly humorous ways to allow pasasage by their successors.  Each level also has par conditions to try to beat for time and lives spent and a hidden monster to feed a knight to for full completion.  The graphics and music are excellent.  The control is at times imprecise (for instance, using one knight as a platoform in a spike pit can be a bit finicky if it's not at a full-speed jump distance away) but manageable.

You have to solve ""puzzles"" (more like just complete levels) to get to the ""Cup of Life"" aka Holy Grail. You use knights and their dead bodies to cross hazardous terrain to get to this said gold cup. Funny, fun, addicting, well worth every penny.Pros:-Encourages you to kill your character for the ""greater good"" XD-Fun and addicting-The ragdoll effects are funny-Cute-Doesn't take up a lot of space on the computer-CheapCons:-Does not run well on slower computers or people with a slow internet connection10/10 you should play or at least try out this game."

,Recommended,250050,15213201,"Posted: 4 April, 2015",all,InfiniteCows,"If you are looking in to whether or not to buy this game, I think you should. It's a really cool puzzle/platformer with an awesome uniue mechanic. That mechanic is that when you die, your body lingers around, and it is used to do things like act as a stepladder, let you climb where there are spikes, and hold down buttons for you. Sometimes I find that I can get a bit frustrated with the puzzles, but I found out that if you just leave it for ten minutes or so and come back to it, that usually solves the problem. This game is a fun, casual pickup I would certainly reccomend."

It's humour is largely derived from the death of the knights and some of the names they have. Some of the puzzles do feel rather easy, although they do increase in difficulty as the game progresses. The mechanics are intuitive and, quite frankly, genius. Solving a puzzle feels satisfying, as does firing a knight from a cannon and hearing the resounding thud as he hits a wall. The game is darkly humorous, which won't hit the spot with most people, although the game is hilarious for those who enjoy a spot of black comedy."

Also, the game definitely shares a sense of humour with me -YMMV, but that made it even better.Overall, a game which is fun and good for relaxing, or for playing when you don't want to sink hours into something."

,Recommended,250050,11350788,"Posted: 21 July, 2014",all,Phantron,"This game is like a nice mix between Portal 2 and Braid, however without portals and time-traveling for sure, but with dying as a mechanic (you have to die at least once in a level). The game gets harder the further you come, and there are multiple solutions, hidden stuff and shortcuts everyhwere and you get rewarded for being smart and thoughtfull. The humor in the game is actually quite minimal and most of it only there at the very end. Also it has a pretty good soundtrack, which sometimes reminded me to Donkey Kong Country Returns and Tropical Freeze, some songs are just epic. Beating levels as fast as you can or with less deaths are good replay values."

A king who does not mind electrocuting, impaling, burning or freezing them to find the cup of life his heart is yearning for. In fact he does not even mind sacrificing them to find a cup that might or might not, but likely not, be the cup of life. Not even when he is using his knights as ammunition in a cannon (insert cannon fodder pun here).And now imagine that you are this king.This is a really fun puzzle game. I am a bit reminded of lemmings, even though those two are still very distinct (among other things the goal of lemmings was to keep most of them alife, whereas here you sacrifice as many as needed to get one to the goal).And if you get it at a discount... there's really nothing you can do wrong there."

The commercial video was the hook for me, as it showed lively and emotional characters along with the gameplay. The sense of humor shown in the trailer definitely carried over to the game, as the escessive loss of life is portrayed with heavy, enjoyable sarcasm. The game itself is equally great, with challenging puzzles an even some boss ""battles."" The music is ambient and reflects the lighthearted mood, with the boss level track being my favorite.  If you're looking for a fun way to spend time, pick up this game, and don't hesitate to buy it if it is on sale."
,Recommended,250050,31554397,Posted: 5 May,all,Anorexic Penguin,"Great game. Overall, I'd give it a solid 8.5/10.The puzzles are actually challenging. Not to mention I absolutely adore the core mechanic (I mean, who heard of a game where you HAVE to die?!?); truly unique stuff. The puzzles require some thought, and you have multiple metrics on which you are graded, significantly increasing the replayability. Additionally, the game maintains an light, humorus tone (which is particually important, because if you mishandle the aesthetics on a game about killing yourself then it takes a dark turn mighty fast).Honestly, I don't see much room for improvement. I rate at an 8.5 because I reserve anything higher than that for games which take my breath away/bring a tear to my eye/engage me for a long time, and by design this just isn't one of those games. Not a complaint as much as an explanation.Kudos to the devs for making me laugh while I killed myself 10 times over."

The difficulty doesn't jump around like it does in many games.The graphics are also amazing.I also like the new objects that are added to the game at certain levels and how you need to figure out how that objects works and interacts with other objects.I like the concept of dying, it's unique."
