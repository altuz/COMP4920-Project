Okay, so most reviews here that I'm seeing, people have already grown up playing it years before it hit Steam... but my boyfriend and I are totally new to it, so I figure our different perspectives might be helpful to some. For years I have watched this game on idle at arcades (I'm not sure which number in the series it was), and always cracked up, and enjoyed the graphics, and personality that went into it. This game is so simple...but what it does, it does so right it doesn't get boring or feel repetitive. I am a very busy artist now (I have a lot less time than I used to), so my video game time is so much more limited. It's great to have a game I can boot up, and figure out in minutes, and just laugh and smile for an hour or two.So far we've played it online for over an hour since we only just bought it...and it was very easy to setup our co-op arcade game, but my boyfriend had the music and sound FX cut out on his after the first few stages! It'll be interesting to see if that happens much more, sometimes our internet connection sucks, but it may have been a bug. If anyone reading this has had that happen too, please leave me a comment!I was born in the 80s, and he was born in the 90s, and we were both fully charmed by the retro feeling of this game. I love how it's just pure and simple FUN to play while still being a rich gaming experience (the atmosphere is fantastic retro-feeling wise). I actually can't wait to play it again, and it's been awhile since a game gave me that feeling. I think it's partially because so many modern games are so involved...you can't just put most games on now, have fun, and be done...it takes hours to accomplish much of anything! For an hour of gameplay on most newer games you might figure out the controls, and explore one stage/level/area. But this one? Only just over an hour in, and we visited a beach with giant crabs, a land covered in zombies, a desert, some modern war ridden places, UNDERWATER, flying, SPACE, BOSS FIGHTS! And a bunch of other stuff I didn't mention. It just entertains the crap out you as rapidly as possible.  Any game where you shoot a funny looking alien or meteorite, and they drop a teddy bear or stuffed bunny doll while listening to over the top retro rock with campy macho character voices, and funny screams is a good game in my book...and apparently most pickups are from scruffy blond dudes who pull items out of their boxers when you rescue them, lol.We lucked out getting it for $3.99 on a Steam sale, but it's worth way more for how fun it is, and just the massive amount of art that went into this thing...and it has an easy mode if you're new to it like us. I can see replaying this game a LOT just to experience all it's great atmosphere, combined with the great gameplay, music and sound FX, again and again.  So unless you can't appreciate a fun action shoot em' up game, with great humor and imagination...then this probably isn't for you. For those of us who like a FUN, tight game that doesn't have over-complicated crap that slows down the fun factor? GET THIS NOW, even if it's not on sale, get this now, and leave a good review! It deserves them!"

,Recommended,250180,9148030,"Posted: 16 February, 2014",all,Squire Grooktook,"Metal Slug 3 is one of the most highly regarded entries in a classic franchise that, along with Contra, has pretty much defined the ""run and gun"" sub-genre of action platformers and shmups.The Metal Slug series has an emphasis on enemies crowding around (collision damage can't kill you), conservation of power ups, and a variety of vehicles which appear throughout the game and change the way you move and fight for a limited time.As for MS3 itself, it's similar to Contra 3 in that it stands on a  middle-ground between early platforming heavy run and gun shooters and the ""boss fest"" design of later games like Contra Hard Corps and Alien Soldier. The game is constantly switching up how you progress through stages, so it's quite varied. There are also multiple paths through each stage, each of which plays differently.Metal Slug 3 is also legendary for its difficulty to 1 credit clear, which is vastly greater than most other shmups and arcade shooters. It's not that it has anymore cheap deaths or memorization than any other shooter, it's just that it's very random (often forcing you to react very quickly), very long, very punishing for even the slightest mistake, and requires fairly high execution. This is all if you're going for a 1cc however. The game is still quite fun if played with more than one credit, so a 1cc should really be regarded as the ultimate challenge to be tackled if you feel brave enough.As for the port quality, it's decent. I haven't played the game on GGPO or Supercade enough so I can't quite compare the netcode for co op to those, but it's generally decent, though I've occasionally seen lag spikes that can get both you and your partner killed if you don't pause and wait them out. Similarly, there's occasionally some strange frame rate hiccups during single player, but these are much more rare.All in all I'd say definitely buy it if you don't already own it on some other collection. If you've already been playing it on MAME or whatever, now you can have a nice official copy and don't have to worry about pirating an excellent game. If you haven't played it already, definitely go for it 'cause it's a classic."

But no: there still are some new innovations.Well, the gameplay is still the same: you run and shoot to take down soldiers, aliens, monsters, vehicles and so on. There are POW, Huge Bosses, There are Metal Slugs and other vehicles, but now there are new vehicles: Camel Slug, Elephant Slug and an Ostrich Slug... Why? Why not, I say... XDThere are new enemies, New scenarios of course, Very cool music and the thing that really surprised me is the final mission. Now, I can't say that the story in Metal slug is a greatly written and acted novel... It always has been more like a pretext to give the gameplay a context, and in this chapter... well, to prevent any spoiler all I can say is that the final mission is seriously taken to the next level, to an Epic level, I dare to say. Of course, everything is in the joking tone typical of any Metal Slug, but still I consider this chapter the best most epic of this Trilogy (Here in Steam there are only the first 3 titles... :( )+++PROs+++EPICNESS.The game is badass and Fun as usual, but the last mission is something really unbelievable. That one is worth the entire game.GAMEPLAY.The simplicity of te game mechanics, the huge hordes of enemies, the innovations introduced in this chapter, everything makes this game just fun.COOP.Clearly this game is way more fun with the help of a friend and you can play both on the same computer and online. Smart move.MUSIC.I Honestly enjoyed this chapter's music in general, besides there's one of my favorite tracks (the desert stage, time ago I've recorded a real instrument cover on YouTube, just to prove how much I love that track)---CONs---PORT ISSUES.This isn't the best porting ever. Seems like this chapter suffer the same issues like Screen Resolution Bugs which caused me problems if I try to set my native 1080p, as it just crops visualizing just the upper left corner of the screen, so I had to play in 720p... Which is not that bad issue as it's not like I'm going to miss high res textures or stuff like that. Another problem involves performance issues: lots of player (if not all of them) noticed there are huge FPS drops in overcrowded situations... Which is ridiculous considering the game and the ""engine""."
,Recommended,250180,9149163,"Posted: 16 February, 2014",all,CR4YCR4Y,"I noticed most of the reviews of this game go along the lines of “11/10 it's Metal Slug”. I'm going to quit it with this pattern and tell you exactly why you should give SNK your money to play this video game as if you'd never been into an arcade before.For the uninitiated: Metal Slug 3 is a run and gun game that hits all of the nails on the head with the back of a rawket lawnchair that looks like a shotgun for no real reason, doesn't take itself too seriously, has powerups that can't be described using words that aren't synonymous with “fun” or “baller” and has vehicles named “Slugs”.The responsiveness and naturalness of the controls is a big point to mention in this game. Your character controls like a dream, with jumping controls to avoid the slew of bullets coming your way being crisp and responsive, and character movement being about as immediate as your thumb, fingers, or hand(joystick 4 lyfe) is. Which is important because it's one shot and you're dead. But you get a total of about 60 lives so it's fine.Fire direction is tied to your movement, but the game is balanced around this in a manner in which you won't miss the free aiming typically associated with modern run and guns, and will probably find it more fun in all honesty.Speaking of fire direction, the lack of 8 firing directions like in similar games is done beautifully rather than frustratingly, as it enables you to fire upwards while walking or do things like jump or move and aim straight down while moving in midair, things you'll need to pull sometimes to make it out alive. In places where diagonal fire is even something you'd feel the need for (which are short, infrequent, and don't overstay their welcome), you're always given a heavy machine gun which is capable of fire on diagonals should you aim it upwards and downwards again while firing. These segments are incredibly satisfying to take on.AND THEN THERE ARE SLUGS. An important part of the series, slugs are the vehicles you're able to get into which just ramp up the insanity to a whole new level. Be it a tank with an aimable machine gun and a cannon, an armored weaponized submarine, or a camel that shoots plasma balls at your enemies, These multi-hitpoint wonders just rain death if you take care of them and it's as amazing as it seems.I've yet to mention the satisfying little details that this game crammed in to make everything just so much better than any competing games have accomplished as far as I'm aware. Little things like the cosmetic reload animations that happen when you're idle, or that eating too much food makes you fat and melee attack with a fork really complete the game.The menus are a bit confusing with a controller, as they were designed with older game pads in mind and not xbox 360 controllers, so there will be some awkwardness when A isn't select and B isn't back if you rebind your controls (you'll really want to, I recommend X for shoot, A for jump, and right bumper for grenade), but I came here to review a game not a menu.Overall, if you're looking for a good time that doesn't involve hand holding, I'd have to recommend this game. If you're looking for some hand holding, Easy mode is still pretty okay, so I'd still have to recommend it."

There's oh so many ways the Rebels try to off you. Knifing, plain old rockets, grenades and bullets, speeding at you with a motorcycle, tanks, fighter planes, Cumbersome exoskeletons and some other nondescript vehicle-like contraptions at some boss fights. Every attack can be avoided, even the non-projectile type. You are for those given a short time to move off their area of damage.- Maps have 2 routes branching. Adds nice variety.- Great sound design. Explosions, enemy death sounds, and weapon sounds are some just like from an over-the-top 80s action flick. Every sound fits perfectly to the game's silly nature.- Still beautiful graphics. Environments are detailed with realistic lighting yet don't look overly photorealistic in their art style. Animations are so fluid, it's unbelievable! Sad that one can't admire the graphics really when the game is so frantic heh.- Various usable vehicles, an exoskeleton, a tank and a fighter plane + some other craft. What's cool is that all of the ground vehicles can jump and crouch!- Excellent soundtrack, the music is simply so pumping and each tune fits the current situation. For example when infiltrating the Rebels' war machine factory, the music is just perfectly sneakytastic.- EPIC climax.What could be fixed however:- Music instruments often play in an uneven rhythm. Dunno what causes it, sound drivers perhaps but music doesn't play quite like it should."

If you haven’t played this before expect to die every three seconds but the chaos on screen and barrage of death is actually part of the fun!If you are wondering whether to get Metal Slug 3 or Metal Slug X my advice would be to wait until they are on sale and get both! They are both very good games and it really just depends on what mood you’re in and how much time you have as to which game to pick.Metal Slug 3 is a longer game overall and a slightly more difficult one too. It has a little more variation in the type of enemies that attack you, at least from level to level and there are branching pathways to explore. There is more variety with some flying and underwater levels and a greater amount of craft and animals to get in/on to mix things up. This along with more actual levels to fight through at the end stages bulks the game out more.Metal Slug X is a more streamlined game that takes less time to complete and is a little easier overall. It has a more linear level design and more opportunity to pilot the Metal Slug tank itself. This perhaps gives it a bit more of an early arcade experience and possibly provides a little more flow to the feel of the gameplay. This is also good if you’re looking to squeeze some side scrolling Shoot ´Em Up action into a busy day or don’t feel like spending a great deal of time playing.Both games have enough differences (as well as positive similarities) in level design and feel/vibe to warrant buying/playing them both if you like this genre of game and it really is more down to what frame of mind you’re in to which particular one you feel like playing. They are such enjoyable, well designed games to play it’s hard to say which is better. I do suggest you get both but I guess if I had a Heavy Machine Gun pressed to my head and I had to choose only one then Metal Slug 3 might come out on top by a (POW´s) whisker but I would miss playing X too."

Like Contra there are many unique weapon pickups and of course the vehicles. Only real downside to this port is that you cannot adjust the amount of continues. But the plus side is that you can select from any mission in the game. You have 20 continues which is fair amount. The game is rather challenging but I have managed to get to the last chapter on hard difficulty. I highly recommend Metal slug 3 especially if you have a friend to play coop with.

,Recommended,250180,10624394,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,twitch.tv/tofutehsurvivor,"Metal Slug 3is a classic in side-scrolling arcade/shooter action! TheMetal Slugis an SNK gem renowned for it's for it's fun co-op, hectic level designs, and challenging boss fights! It's just a fantastic game overall if you're into classic gaming before the year 2004. I say the year2004, because that's right when the influx of action/first-person shooters began to flood the market. That's why classic arcade experiences, such as this one must be revisited, or discovered for the first time for the younger audience.I'll keep this somewhat brief, since it is simple title to break down. Also, I have many hours of this title already onseveral different platforms including:ArcadeXboxXbox 360Please take my word for it that I know this game.It'sMetal Slug 3.You run across the screens shooting and lobbing grenades at as many things as you can while dodging lots of enemies. There are vehicles and mounts to ride with their own sets of weapons. These come in extremely handy, since they can also double as a set of armor for you if you get hit.There are five missions, with the fifth being the longest, and you will probably beat this less than an hour, or maybe just a little bit over if you stretch your times. Levels are varied wit jungle, desert, underwater, and temples just for example. You'll fight lots of different enemies too in each one. Every level also has branching paths, so it is possible to make it to the boss by taking one of the couple routes. Some routes are also a bit hidden too, so you'll definitely feel awesome once you find a secret passage!The music rocks. Next subject.Sound! However they ported this, they managed to mess up/distort the sound for ""GO!"" when it tells you to move on. It sounds like ""GO!"" is old and about to fall over dead. It doesn't effect gameplay though.Controls for gamepad are okay, I guess. I use a Dualshock 3 Sixaxis with Motioninjoy, so the game thinks I'm just using a 360 pad. I have not experimented with keyboard controls yet, nor will I ever attempt them. The biggest bug about the controls, and this is SUPER minor:(using a 360 pad)A = shootX = grenadeB = jumpThis is changable from the config menu, but changing shoot to X, for example, will default you're ""OK"" button to X for menus, and that just feel like it could've been avoided. As aMetal Slugplayer for console, that's super awkward for me to deal with since I've been using X = shoot, B = grenade, and A = Jump for at least ten years. That's it though. THAT IS IT. That's myONLYmoan towards controls, and the controls are so spot-on responsive that I will dismiss that completely as a moan. I just felt it was only appropriate to let everyone else know, because it does not break the game.I'm running Windows 7, and this game performs well on my Asus G75VW notebook. I've yet to have any crashes, or slowdowns/stutters. This game shouldn't take super beefy hardware to run properly, but I imagine that running this on a rig older than 2004 might prove to be problematic for those complaining on the forums.YOU'RE GAMERS: STOP USING GRANDMA'S GATEWAY IN THE ATTIC.The core game remains unchanged, with the exception of having a limited amount of credits. The credit system varies from various console releases of the game where you would usually have an infinite amount of continues, but you start a new game with 20 credits off the rip. I'm okay with this, because it means I can't just waste all of my lives in the first three levels without consequence. That also means this game has more replayability since you may not pass it the first time on limited continues.I recommend this game, even when it is not on sale, because even then it's still less than $9.99  It's awesome, and it's even more awesome if you've never had the chance to experience it! Pick it up, and play it with a friend. That's the best way to it, because it'sMetal Slug 3!**STILL TO COME!!**I will update this review once I try out the multiplayer, which I have heard mixed opinions about. What I do know about online co-op so far, is that there is no match making. It is strictly private lobbies that you can invite one person from your friends list into."

I played through the missions individually because I don't like being punished. The game was mostly enjoyable but the final mission was designed to eat quarters. The final mission is FUN, but VERY CHALLENGING.I prefer to play classic games without ugly filtering effects, this MS3 lets you run completely clean or with filtering effects. It even has a wide mode (that I think doesn't stretch) but I chose to play in 4:3 windowed mode. I'm not totally sure if this is an emulation, but part, if not all, of the ROM dumps are in the game's install folder. I think it's more like an emulator with a custom front-end on the game. Not sure how all that works  but as someone that hasn't really played the heck our of Metal Slug, it seemed fine to me and worked well."

Having said that, this port is poorly done, and I imagine that the original developers of this masterpiece would cringe if they saw what it has become here.While the original gameplay still shines, there are a few head scratching flaws with this port.  The game slows down with heavy action on the screen, but it can also slow down or temporarily freeze in relatively calm areas.  The aforementioned slow down is also accompanied by music that speeds up or slows down(not intentionally).  I've noticed this during stage transitions, and it's very annoying if you're a die hard fan of the original version, or even the well done original Xbox or Xbox 360 (outside of the sprite smoothing in the latter version) versions (not to mention the Anthology version, of course).  The music itself is also of a lower quality than the original.  This is noticeable in several areas, and it seems like an emulation issue.If you've never played a Metal Slug game before, these issues may not bother you.  If you have, or if you're looking for the most faithful version of this, I'd suggest that you look elsewhere.  Perhaps SNK will one day upload the true version of this game."

There would be this arcade machine that has multiple games on it and this was one of them and it only cost a quarter per play. Basically the game is a action pack 2d side scrolling shooter game.It has various weapons, enemies and even different ways to progress into the level so it was never a dull moment and def. has replay value. For the single player mode you only have 20 credits but you can continue from any of the five missions available (which is quite long), so if you died on mission 3 you can select and continue from mission 3 with fresh 20 credits. I probably ate like 100 credits along the way!Whats even better is that I was playing co op with my friend which makes it even more satisfying. If you live in the NYC area, theres one arcade machine that has this game is located at the chinatown fair, if you ever pass by check it out.And one more thing, if you're trying co op and it lags when you host the game, make sure your friend tries hosting it because when I try to host the game it was lagging terribly. I live in new york and my friend lives in germany. When he tried hosting, the game was lag free.

The screen is filled with enemies, explosions and projectiles. Everything is nicely animated and the cartoonish pixel art graphics are gorgeous.The gameplay is frenetic, and very responsive. It doesn't feel stiff like a lot of old games, this game is very smooth to play. A good point is that it can be played with mouse & keyboard, or gamepads. And it recognizes different brands of gamepads, unlike a lot of recent games that only lazily recognize the traitorous Xbox360 pad.Metal Slug 3 is the pinnacle of the series. Tons of weapons, different branching paths, tons of different enemies and creatures to fight (soldiers, zombies, extra-terrestrials, snails, wasps, submarines, planes, yeti men, and so on and so on). Moreover, the gameplay sequences undergo a lot of variation: different vehicles, space invaders/shoot-em-up phases, aquatic fight, and so on and so on. The boss fights are very well done (can be very very tough though). Once a mission has been unlocked in the main campaign mode, it is possible to start from it at any time.There is an online leaderboard for all the difficulty settings,  but the best thing is that there is an online Co-op mode. ONLINE CO-OP MODE ON METAL SLUG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is awesome.On the negative side, despite the quite good port, some bugs can appear at times to times, such as the sound disappearing. There aren't many graphical filters, but it is possible to add them if you follow this guide (I recommend HQ4X)http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=227190051Overall, this game is tons of fun, is reasonably challenging and feels great to play.

,Recommended,250180,9107784,"Posted: 14 February, 2014",all,nihilistic fuckwit,"Metal Slug 3 is considered by many to be the culmination of SNK's run and gun franchise, and its incarnation on steam is a testament to the level of quality the franchise offers. The steam version of the game boasts an ""arcade perfect"" version of the game, with additional extras such as mission mode, online multiplayer through the steam community, and full controller support. And for the most part, Metal Slug 3 delivers. The controls are smooth and responsive (although you may wish to rebind your controls before starting the game), the video displays at 60 fps (an imporessive feat for a PC port) and the timeless gameplay and difficulty is preserved.Only two issues were encountered upon my first play of the game: the first issue was that the audio, particularly the music, seems to be slightly out of sync with the game, in that it will speed up slightly or the drums will be off-rythym. This is likely due to the fact that the game isn't meant to be played at the current framerate (hopefully DotEmu will patch this... hint hint). The second issue I encountered in online play with a friend, where sometimes the game would stop for a few seconds, and then resume. This may be an attempt to sync up the players and compensate for latency, and hopefully later patches will minimize this.Despite these two issues, the game easily passes my expectations of the Steam port, making this the definitive version of Metal Slug 3. Definitely worth picking up for the price, since it's fairly likely that DotEmu will resolve these issues (and I have faith that they are capable of doing so)."

I think. It's hard to say since they don't have the most replay value in the world and my judgement is a little clouded by nostalgia.All in all, there's not really a better 2D shooting sidescroller I can think of.

I remember they would give me about a dollar fifty and i would blow it in three minutes asking for more.I guess really what im trying to say is this game was always hard, the usual troupes of arcade 2D shooters is here. Hordes of  enemies, rapid attack patterns, seemingly endless respawn points for enemies, and one shot deaths.Needless to say unless you have a free to play arcade cabniet with this game in it, this is about the best port you can get. For the 8 dollars it can really bring you back if you played in the arcades or even if you played when at a resturant till your food came like I did.The mind numbing nature of mashing your fire button (or if you wuss out of that challenge and use the autofire button like I did) can keep you sweating and weaving in and out of the insane rapid fire attack patterns this game loves to throw at you.The veichles are amazing and a core staple of this game, from submarines to classic tanks to jetpacks and camels strapped with turrets. Its all here.The variety of weapons is also really on point for the pace it tries to aim for (super sanic fast by the way) and although my only gripe with the weapon drop system is that all to often you will find yourself reciving a heavy machine gun compared to the insane rapid fire flamethrower or the zombie bombs which is by far my favorite weapon in the game and the most creative kind of weapon ive seen in terms of relation to the story (you fight through braindead zombies and might even earn yourself a micro uzi shooting monkey while you do so)!Playing with a friend is also rewarding as most of the time you find your battling against each other just as much as giant mutant crabs or aliens found in the missions. Trying to take a heavy machine gun so you wont have to fire your dinky pistol is more thrilling when your racing to recieve from many of the identical twin prisoners you find scattered throughout your various landscapes, desert, dank and murky caves, and a harbor jsut to name a few.All in all this is a great version of the game like previously mentioned and well worth it for nsotaliga or anyone looking for a fun arcade shooter they can sit down and play quick sessions of (each mission your sent on only last about ten minutes at most if you plow through it and dont die at every turn)My rating of this port is a 9.5/10 with my only gripe being this games crutch on giving you a heavy machine gun and not keeping the weapons you can use in the levels to a wide variety. I assume this is done so you cant plow through levels with certain weapons and making them to easy, again this goes back to programers making the game superficially hard to eat your quarters but seeing as the only penalty on this verison is a point restart you really have nothing to worry about.With that being said it dosnt really hinder the game as a whole and is really just a personal gripe of mine.9.5/10Buy it if you have eight dollars lying around, you will get a blast from it guarented!"

The game is a constant bulletstorm and sometimes the hazards are unavoidable and even if it is managable, you still need inhuman reflexes.On my first try on normal solo I beat the game with 52 continues...sounds a lot, but once you get to the last mission, you just keep dying, especially on the last boss.All in all the game is awesome, the secrets, the warmachines (and animals) you find during the levels are all looks and works ok.I recommend the game, but only for people who dont care about unfair challanges, because you gonna die...A LOT!P.SI was just staring jaw-dropped on level 2 when i got killed and got back up as a zombie.

There were some keys I couldn't map, and the graphics menu was buggy and so it took more time than it should have for me to adjust the graphics settings.Second, and more importantly, there needs to be a ""Disable suicide attack"" option. I understand that it's a mixture of the auto-fire command and the jump button in-game (jump + attack is the suicide attack combo in a vehicle, so you basically cannot try to jump while holding auto-fire), but frankly, I have suicided my vehicle far more times in this version than in literally any other version of Metal Slug I have every played. And that includes this same company's version of Metal Slug 3 on the iOS, which, incidentally, doesn't share the same issue with ""every vehicle of mine will suicide charge into a random wall"" that this version has."

Every new world meant new enemies with new tells, so this would be initially confusing, but eventually triumph wasn't far off.Metal Slug changes enemies/tells about every two minutes during gameplay. It does not expect you to learn all of them in the first playthrough, but will openly mock you for the death to that grenade, to that poison crab bubble, to that gigantic eye laser. If you keep playing, one by one the attacks will start to fail. The forces will start to fall, and eventually a war is happening on every side of the screen, and you still haven't gotten hit yet."

,Recommended,250180,8954669,"Posted: 2 February, 2014",all,Paikia,"Kk, since I got the privilige of playing this version of the game before the official release (early access by courtesy of the ConSouls Steam group), I figured I'd share my impressions.I'm guessing that since I'm not really familiar with the original version(s) of Metal Slug 3, thus not really sharing the nostalgia, my review might seem a little harsh or cold to people who do remember this game fondly. I will mention, however, that I am a fanboy of old-school side-scrollering platformers and shooters, so I'm not going to judge this game from the perspective of the modern gamer either./Looks up...  Ugh, quite the mouthfull. Better get to the point before boring everyone to death. So here goes:Just to make sure everyone knows - this game is the *original* Metal Slug 3, as in the classic SNK Neo-Geo old-school side-scrolling platform/shooting game from 2000. It's not a remake, so don't expect any fancy graphics or otherwise moden game technology. Also on that aspect, the game is slow, the controls are very rough and the game is very unforgiving when it comes to dodging incoming fire or avoiding enemies. Also, as a first-timer playing the game on the 'Medium' difficulty level, I can safely say I got my a$$ handed to me on a plate - over and over again. Having all that said, the game is fun to play, and as far as I'm concerned, is a great example of how a game can be difficult without being frustrating. What this means, at least for me, is that dying and starting over is no big deal, I don't rage quit, I don't get angry or depressed over it, I just start over, hoping to do better this time around. Too bad many games lack that trait (:cough: Rogue Legacy :cough:).Kk, to summarize, I'll say I'm definitely going to keep playing this game, so I suppose I'll be updating this review as well. So far, anyway, despite being a relic, this game is fun to play, even without the nostalgia factor. Definitely worth getting for fans of the genre, and I suppose it's a must for the old fans of the game from the Neo-Geo era."

I love the retro graphics and the autofire but the downside is that there is no health bar. Dying over and over is frustrating but being able to have unlimited coins (due to the recent update) and in turn unlimited lives is worth having no health. It truly is a satisfying game to kill those soldiers over and over and over again.Edit 7/3/16After playing this game for 34 hours, I have to say that this is one of the best games in my library. I mean even though the story isn't that complex, I got to say, the gameplay is just awesome. The graphics I have to say are really cool. I mean when you kill a soldier, there are different animations on how he dies. The pixels all splatter with blood or he just keeps out of the screen. I have made it my goal to get through the whole game perfect but always get killed at the last mission (mission 5). I totally recommend this to everyone because it is a nice game to pass the time or to get into retro gaming. Really puts appreciation into retro arcade games and console games. Damn, not enough RAWKET LAWNCHAIREdit 11/26/16I am so close to finishing the game. I recently nominated this game for the ""Test of Time"" award.

The high difficulty is kinda expected to be compensated by the fact you'll have that buddy with you to compensate to lose not so many lives. Twice the damage, twice the cover. The game also gives you what they seem as a reasonable amount of continues.I like to try every metal slug game at least once, and I had some fun with 4, so I decided to try going to 3.What I've always liked about the metal slug games is the creativity the levels give, but i've never ever liked the prisoner rating system of the games, the fact that as soon as you die even once from the hail of bullets and guts that the game throws on you, it's wiped.Metal slug 3 can easily overwhelm single players into dying multiple times in quick succession from the ridiculous amount of projectiles that can build up, and the mode of difficulty you choose really means nothing in truth. The control mapping isn't perfect and comfortable, but it's your own customizationable choice as to what you want in the end. By the end of the second mission, I already had enough of this game for the day, and my return to it is not clear. The game only has the arcade mode, and free mode options of gameplay, being an emulation of the original,  so don't expect mass gameplay branching.Basically the choice at the end of the day is yours, whether the game piques your interest or not, but I will say plan ahead first. Grab a friend, grab a headset, communicate, and have fun while you play. If you're old pro veterans of this game that know the path of every living pixel shot at you, or want a nostalgia pickup, then by all means jump straight in. If you're a solo player and new to gaming, or like me, still rather inexperienced with the metal slug series, this may be a series best avoided and never touched again. There are plently of other screen-scrolling arcade gun games that may appeal as a less torturous (and a bit morbid) experience."

However the emulation is a bit shoddy (especially in terms of sound), and netcode (that was originally used for GGPO, or so I heard) could be better. It could be somewhat lacking even compared to AES version and to say about PS2 or XBOX... Well, I don't really want to cut down this game that much.That doesn't mean the game is bad. Like already said, the game itself is blast. It is top-of-the-class sidescrolling shoot'em up, with SNK (now SNKP)'s artistic pixel art. The game was originally developed on 304x224 resolution, but it is still pleasing to eye. You can play as 4 iconic, lovable characters (although their stats doesn't vary until MS6), and there are plentiful of arsenal and vehicles in your way. Also this game was the first in the series to have alternative routes, giving players replayability. Also the story, while not serious at all and sometimes over the top, is simply the best among the series and can even bring tears of glory and victory in players' eyes.Still, many people seems to having problems, regardless of their direness. So I'd suggest you to wait a while until the dust is settled. After all, this game was originally released in 2000, so you're most likely not missing much by waiting. Also, as this game doesn't support any kind of matchmaking, so people can play only with thier Steam friend, I suggest you to pick the two-pack and play with your friend.In short, (whoops, it is not short at all!)Cons:- Classic shoot'em up masterpiece from 2000- Easily the best among the series- Online multiplayer with Steam friends- $8 without any discount, which is pretty cheap even compared what most would spend on the arcade.Pros:- Emulation is a bit shoddy, considering it is from 2000 and was already emulated near perfectly several times. Speed or the game and sound are pretty much the most problem.- Netcode is not the best. Even after beta testing, desync issues are reported here and there. In my case, I've experienced quite a bit of latency issue.- Configurations are a bit lacking. You can't set the volume of the game, which seems to be looked over as the game seems to be mobile port. Also Slug Attack button and Vulcan Fix option that were available in the original AES version is nowhere to be seen.- Some are reporting various freezing and/or stuttering issues. Which could be a big issue considering the game's nature.I would recommend this game more than I ever can if it worked flawlessly. Sadly, currently it is not. Although some people, including myself, have about no problem. However if I were you, I would wait until those issues are solved."

Levels will pit the play against everything from enemy soldiers to zombies and mutant animals. Players can to make use of various vehicals and weapons to fight through the levels and enemies. The game can also be played split screen co-op, though sadly the online co-op can only be played with people who are friends on steam, there is no random match-making.

The Aesthetics of Neo Geo era SNK games are some of the best in gaming history, but this port of the game makes more than half of the effects sound warped and muddled, like MIDI files being run through a distorted wax cylinder.If DotEmu really had access to the code from the game, and SNK gave them their blessing to port and release it, then they have failed in that most basic of tasks. This feels more like an open-source homebrew emulator that's failing at properly capturing all of the underlying greatness of this game, than something you would expect to come straight from the original developer."

A classic from my years of practically living in an arcade, I've sunk numerous hours of my youth in front of machines playing these games. Imagine my suprise playing it on my laptop 14 years later.And unfortunately, my time with it on this platform was barely passable.The main selling point for this port of MS3 was online co-op with a friend. I honestly feel that the netcode for this game is poor as I both me and my pal have low ping counts towards each other, and started to play a game to see each  other teleporting and not responding to controls until 3 seconds later. Very disappointing.Another issue with the game i have is the limitations of credits. I find this to be a puzzling restriction, as the 20 credits are not change able, and keep only but the good players of the game from reaching the end with a handful of credits left. Perhaps I've been spoiled with emulators and their key to add credits, but even yet, this restriction is puzzling.Finally, a good chunk of sounds in this port have Very noticible changes in they way they sound, compared to their arcade counterparts. the sub-boss in Mission 2,and the main boss of Mission 4 have a high pitched whining noise that replace the original sounds of some of their attacks. I suspect that this is a result from the game being ported and not an emulation, but as an audophile, these changes are very noticible, and not subtle at all. It may seem like a nitpick, and I would agree if their replacement wasn't an annoying high pitched whine. A real nitpick would be ""OKAY!"" playing after each selection from their menus.Other than those issues, the main game is a complete port, no issues.  I can't completely reccommend this game from my standpoint, as the above has left me a tad disappointed, but If you've never played MS3 before, and you don't know how to MAME or other emulators, you could do much worse than playing this port."

If you're unfamiliar with the series they're run-and-gun, side-scrolling, pixelated festivals for the eyes. It's a good way to kill an hour or two with a buddy, and they even made it so you can play with people online.Metal Slug 3 is a fan favorite among the series, which seems likely why it was ported first. Many years after the fact the game remains a terrific bit of fun with clean, detailed animation that makes the game fun to watch even if you're terrible at it. The best part is it won't be costing you quarters; however, there is a 20 credit cap, meaning you might need to resort to mission mode (individual level select) to take down the later levels.The only real drawback is that the game is short. But there are multiple pathways through the levels with unique surprises, and it has a high level of replayability."

76561198002968034,Recommended,250180,10911302,"Posted: 28 June, 2014",all,Kai,"Possibly the best entry in the series, Metal Slug 3 is a crazy ride that will have you laughing, crying, and sometimes saying WTF?  From start to finish the game can be completed in about an hour, but there are multiple paths to take in the levels with different vehicles to try.  Its all about trying to increase your score and master the gameplay.The MS series is a fast paced run & gun side scroller thats all about collecting powerups to give you the edge over the enemies and getting the highest score you can.  Along the way you'll encounter a large variety of enemies not found in MS 1 or 2.  The level design this time around is top notch which gives it an edge over other entries in the series.Metal Slug can certainly be frustrating at times.  It was designed to eat your quarters in the arcade and it aims to kill you repeatedly and quickly.  This can be overcome with practice and learning the layouts of the levels.  The high difficulty can be countered by switching the difficulty down to an easier level (not possible in the original version).Possibly the best thing in this version of Metal Slug 3 is the inclusion of online multiplayer.  Its very easy to set up a game and invite someone else to play with you.  Its only 2 player, but at least they don't have to be in the same room playing on the same computer with you.Overall the game is pretty funny and easy to just pick up and play.  The achievements are also a nice addition and something to work for while mastering the game."

There's just something about teaming up with the Commu-Nazis to rescue your squadmates from alien zombie clones that isn't captured by, uh, typical video games. That being said, there's a thin line between bringing a classic back on a new platform and cashing in on a license.This is the latter.Poor graphics options, distorted sound, occasional dropped inputs, and (apparently) mediocre netplay really degrade what MS3 is supposed to be. As others have mentioned, this is a port of the iOS version of the game, and it inherits many of the mobile version's concessions and limitations. I really don't think this is necessary. It's not like nobody has ever partnered with GGPO for re-releases of arcade classics.That being said, it's cheap, it's on Steam, and it's Metal Slug. If that's what you have to do to get some friends into a balls-hard classic, get it. If you're a Metal Slug die hard, well...There are alternatives."

,Not Recommended,250180,13718824,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,Deadjack,"This Metal Slug is a scam.[! Warning ! Long Review !]The first thing wich strikes is the present of the firm ""Dot Emu"" at the beginning of the game.They are specialized in emulation of old games. Quite nice in the fact that they bring to us playable old games like the incredible ""Little Big Adventure"" (you have to try it !).The problem is that this game is just an emulation of Metal Slug 3.There is nothing new like the for most controversed Metal Slug: Metal Slug Advance.On this one they tried to bring new elements like collecting cards to customize your game or new characters with new levels and story.Here this is just a copy of Metal Slug 3 with new menus, a online co-op and an artwork page.And Metal Slug 3 was annoying. Take all the previous opus and mix them to create a hardcore mess with no structure and balance. Critics in my country were quite bad if i remember.Too much enemies are over powerfull and appears at wrong times.For exemple in the second level: you were blasting zombies, you take a strange passage to discover a cave full of snow men who launches at you 3 types of attacks with one capable to freeze you around 15 secs ... wtf ?!For the story: of course you got the eternal X army with same soldiers and vehicles. They've added (again) aliens, zombies with new one likes insects, lobsters, carnivourous plants, robots, snowmans, ect.... so nothing special. Bosses are uggly like the metal crab in the first level or the robot in the third.The order of the 6 levels is not relevant, for exemple at the end you will be in some kind of ""organic zone"" and after in a metal one with ennemies totally differents and ,again, overpowerfull.As if they've just mixed everything in Metal Slug and threw it at our faces. In the same level you can even pilot copters, jets, submarines, ect... the real problem is , at this point of the game, the lack of quality because thoses very shorts sessions with vehicles are boring (except for the rocket).You can use many junctions in levels but at the end it brings nothing but being unrelevant.I remember long minutes of fighting with the famous metal slug or with the camel in Metal Slug 2 ( for exemple: the boss of the first level was awesome, a sort of Sadam Hussein in an armored plane).We had many occasions to laugh in Metal Slug. In the 2 you had a nice vision of the movie ""Independance Day ""  at the end of the game (thanks to X army's silly soldiers ^^). Metal Slug 1 and 2 were master pieces of this humour SNK have the secret.Here, it just have been forgotten (only the soldier in front of the rocket in the last level). There is just no way to laugh and enjoy the game.The last mission is a joke because it lasts more than 2 previous levels ! Instead of cutting it they gave use a painfull big one.The game is horribly difficult even in normal mod ! I played 100 minutes and i didn't finished the last level (20 continues were used in normal mode !).You will say i'm just a ""ranting"" noob.Try to keep your weapons (with full ammo) when you got other weapons boucing all over your screen !!Keep in mind that swaping a weapon make you lost the previous amount of ammo and you will understand how painfull it is (especially the rocket moment).For the graphics, i have to admit menus are nices like artworks ( btw some are very uggly like the ""soldier with breasts"").But in game they've done nothing===> emulation !....We pay for playing an emulated game ! Of course many people will say: ""but we have online co-op !""I will answer: and ? Metal Slug was an arcade game for 2 players.So there is nothing new... except the huge amount of bugs, sound problems and lack of controlers.This game is a joke and i'm sorry for thoses who likes it because they deserve better.Try with an emulator of the 2 previous episode for free or buy other shooters ( like Intrusion 2, James Town, Jets and Guns, ect...).There are many other interresting games were you can spend your 6 bucks."

I can't say anything about the story or characters. But that's ok. I didn't need any explination to play the game. It just drops you right into the action.At first I wasn't expecting much... and I died in the first 2 minutes or so ;D It has a very simple concept: ""One hit,that's it,you're dead!"". This game is HARD! Not AS hard as ,say, Ninja Gaiden... But it definatly has the difficulty of Megaman. A good thing is: You have unlimited Continues! And you'll always respawn right where you died. That alone makes the game possible for people like me,who aren't into hard games.The graphic is so...so....Beautiful. It totally reminds me of the old SNES games and it is ,as mentioned before, hard as balls,wich kinda fits into the SNES libarary (Looking at games like Contra).It's very detailed (especially the Credits Screen!) wich makes it good to look at. The characters and weapons all look like real things and act this way (Yes,even the guns XD).The Soundtrack is hard to categorize...I wouldn't say that the Soundtrack's bad... I just can't remember any of the Songs. IF I remember correctly, the soundtrack was pretty cool and fitting for the Stage/Boss!Oh yeah,talking about bosses. This game has 5 Stages (Kinda remind me of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance). They aren't really that long (Exept for the last one) but they're ,still,Hard as balls. Evey Stage has a boss at the end of it. Every boss in this game is challenging and fun,exept for the last one!->Spoiler warning: Skip to the next arrow to skip this Spoiler!!!After you defeated the enemy organisations boss,it turns out that the real boss has been kidnapped and you were fighting an Alien instead.The character that you've used to finish that alien of will also be kidnapped by the aliens,making him unusable.You use a rocket and follow the aliens ship into space,enter it and destroy the machine that you character's kept in. This creates tons of ""Zombieclones"" of that character. I was expecting an epic final fight....Turn out that you ""only"" fight the alienboss,and you're almost unable to move without diyng. This was a fight that I was looking for,and sadly it turned out to me ""Ok"" at best.->No more Spoilers from this point on!All in all,I would probably rate this game 8/10 Points. The music is hard to remember and the final boss is dissapointing. Eveything else is Great! You should definatly buy this game (Especially because it's only 1,25€ right now)Wow,if you've made it to this point,let me just say thank you for reading my review! Hope you liked it!!!"

Then you fight zombies and if you find the secret cave you fight these ice creatures out of nowhere then you fight giant alians AND THEN fight this future thing that majically pops out of the ground on the second level. THEN on the third level your all of a sudden under water fighting nazis again and you fight into this base with robots than shoot lazers then nazis then nazis in machines then this giant robot thats in this lava room on the third level. Then next your in a desert fighting nazis again then you fight these plants and you have to shoot these tiny plants that come down and blow you up and if you go this secret way you fight mummys or these arab guys then the boss is this random face thing on top of a pyramid for no reason what so ever. THEN THE LAST LEVEL NO LOGIC WHAT SO EVER ok so you start then level above the  clouds then you fight in this jet or heli then you hover down and fight more nazis then you fight this buff guy in an airship after that you go to this base and kill these nazis and kill their leader then he turns into an alien and takes you character away then all of a sudden all these rocket ships appear out of nowhere and you go to space and fight aliens and the nazis are now on your side and they all get rekt as soon as you reach space and so after this long battle you think its over THEN OUT OF NOWHERE this giant alien grabs your tank and you end up killing him game over 5 levels confusing story 10/10

That is not to say this game is bad, yet it definitely is not as good or as fun as it could have been.First off, the menu is archaic and slightly annoying. The whole interface is a little off: the game *clicks* every time you move your mouse over a button and an annoying voice actor shouts “OK” when you press a button on the main menu. This is slightly bothersome yet doesn't affect the game that much. It just shows how little extra effort was put into this port.When you get to the mode select, it gives you arcade and mission mode. Don't let this full you, both modes are identical except in mission mode you choose where you start. Once the game begins its your typical run n gun game with lots of enemies and lots of projectiles. The character controls well yet a few things like the inability to shoot diagonally can get annoying. The gameplay eventually gets repetitive with little new ideas or innovative level design between levels. Oh, and by the way you will die a lot...Yet, on the default difficulty, this is one of the easiest games I have played in recent years. Why you might ask? Because there is literally no punishment for death. When you die you respawn in the exact same point and you have unlimited continues (I used 61) and all the enemies retain how much damage you gave them after continues and deaths. You could be terrible at this game and beat it. Yet, with the choices of different number of continues and different difficulty level the game can tailor to players with a variety of different experience levels. Though playing on limited continues makes you realize how unfair deaths and spawns can be as at points the game floods the screen with deadly objects that are nearly impossible to dodge (a double jump might have made the game seem fairer). The difficulty is a slight flaw of the game. The default difficulty should be slightly more difficult and make it possible for people to increase the number of continues.This game has a few aspects that makes it stand out though. The pixel art is beautiful, the animation is incredible and it is very rewarding to see things explode. This game has some of the best pixel art ever and is a joy to look at. Also, the final level has some decent story and new mechanics (Space-esque shooter which is fun) thrown in even if that level is incredibly long and drawn out.Overall, this game is repetitive, has a relatively easy default difficulty, over-priced, unfair deaths and can be lacking in fun from time to time. That being said the game has great pixel art and decent gameplay. I would not recommend this game unless you LOVE pixel art or want some average retro run and gun action. If you can overlook some of my mentioned flaws, you could possibly really enjoy this game.5.9/10"

The music is awesome, A majority of the tracks are orchestral(With a Heroic Commando themed sound) or cultural to represent location, with a few rock tracks, like for the zombie level and a hard portion of one of the later levels IIRC. The bosses are not exactly for beginners, I wouldn't expect anyone to perfect(Kept all POW's and the vehicle if there is one) the 3rd boss and up on their first try.This game features the first appearances of: the Submarine, the upgradable Elephant Slug(It moves faster if it eats chilli peppers, and i think it can use a battery for something), the first ostrich slug, and my favorite, Utan a monkey with a Mac 10 who you can team up with, though he spends most of his time picking his nose, scratching himself and sleeping, you still feel pretty cool to have a monkey pal.This game has a lot of fun packed into it and it's well balanced, the only metal slug I really like more is metal slug 5 for it's transforming gunner slug."

As in, the keep-popping-in-quarters-to-play kind of arcade game. Therefore there are arcade mechanics in the game that are aimed at forcing you to keep putting in money in order to keep playing (such as cheap deaths).Of course this is the Steam version so you only need to pay once upfront. Metal Slug 3 is a 2D run-and-gun action game and is one of the best in the series. It has minimal story and gets to the action right away. In this version you start with 20 credits of lives and are able to skip to any mission once you unlock them. You can play co-op locally or with a Steam friend and you can use a gamepad to play. Being an acade game, it is rather short and can be completed in one to two hours.The game can be played in several languages, although I think the narrator mostly speaks English anyway. A video option of note is that you can enable scanlines or not for that retro look. Speaking of looks, Metal Slug 3 is a great looking action game. SNK really shows their skill and dedication to all the sprites on the screen and the music really fits the action.If you're a fan of great looking sprites and action gameplay that is straight to the point, then I highly recommend this game."

Guide Fio (or one of the other 3 characters I never play as) far into enemy territory mounted on completely insane vehicles such as an elephant mounted with dual heavy machine guns. The first in the series to have 4 playable characters (while still only being 2 player) and featuring aternate routes to speed along our heroes on their fight against the New World Order... and aliens... and zombies.Feeling left out of the craziness that is Metal Slug? You can be a zombie too! Spread your deadly blood in the shape of a massiave jet stream onto unassuming enemy soldiers and watch them burst into nothingness. Ride Slug Mariners into the briny deep to decimate the foes naval forces. Soar the skies and unleash hell in the form of heat-seeking missiles. Eat too much and tread slowly wth a terrible blunderbuss pistol. Do it all and then some as you avoid death from all directions.As most arcade games, this game shines with co-op play. Adding another player always brings more fun to the chaotic nature of run-and-gun games.The price of 7.99 seems a bit hefty for only one game though, as most of the series can be found on collections for various consoles, but the joy of owning it and playing online made it worth the price for me."

76561197991155047,Recommended,250180,9148271,"Posted: 16 February, 2014",all,Cally,"Before I write this review I want to state that I am a Metal Slug fan. I have played the many ports on the PS2, PS3, Xbox and Xbox360 and so I have a good basis of comparison in writing this review.Metal Slug 3 as it is presented here is advertised as being an 'arcade perfect' port. I think this may be selling itself short: it is better than the arcade. There is zero to negligible slowdown or stuttering throughout the entire game. Most of the nano-second long stuttering I did observe was related to when a Steam Achievement was registered, and some parts in the Final Mission where there were so many items (not bullets) on the screen. There is absolutely none of the 'too-many-bullets' slowdown which is present in the original arcade version and most ports. The gameplay is perfect and you couldn't ask for anything better. (Well, you could, but you wouldn't get it.)Also, thankfully, there is an option to turn on auto-fire from holding the fire button instead of being forced to press it continuously. It's an option I'm glad to have as muscle strain of a long gaming session can distract from the enjoyment of the game. (Extreme purists and people playing for competition don't have to worry as it's only an option that can be turned off completely.)What about visuals? There was a little bit of an uproar among Metal Slug fans when the Xbox360 port of Metal Slug 3 featured a sort of 'upscaling' that made the pixellated art of the game smooth and pseudo-'high-definition'. Especially because there was no way to turn it off. I am happy to say that the version presented here has the full beautiful sprite graphics in all their pixellated glory. They're spectacular, and the resolution really allows you to see the detail the artists put into the game. You can see, for example, the spots on the alien eggs that the clones drop in the Final Mission very clearly. A thing you could not normally make out on a standard arcade cabinet or PS2/Xbox port. There is also an option to turn on a sort of 'smooth' look for the graphics, if you really can't handle the pixels.What about the audio? I am sorry to report there are a few sound effects that sound different from their original arcade and its ports. A person playing the game for the first time would never for a second notice it, but longtime fans will be able to hear the difference right away. It's not too obtrusive: mostly the sound of the 'go' arrow and sounds made by the boss monsters. I can happily say however that the highly-recognizable voice of the announcer, the enemy soldiers, and the player death screams are unchanged. As are the voices of the various POWs. Overall, no one will be upset by this except purists who are used to hearing these sounds hundreds/thousands of times, and even then you can get used to it. I can't help but wonder why the changes. That is, if it has something to do with porting the original sounds or if they could not reuse them for some reason.As you may have seen from the previews, some of the artwork has changed. Most noticeably the portraits on the 'select character' screen. It was a great shock to see that they replaced the classic 'ugly' portraits with new stream-lined ones that aren't dynamic at all. I thought at first that maybe they were trying to move away from the old intentionally 'ugly' art in general, or possibly couldn't use the art due to copyright reasons. But then there is an unlockable gallery that showcases a lot of classic Metal Slug art?! I really don't understand. Thankfully, the art changes begins and ends at the menus and the 'select character' screen.There is an option to play this with online multiplayer, or with two controllers on the same computer. Unfortunately I cannot really report how reliable it is because I was unable to find a partner. Honestly, it doesn't much matter to me. If I finally get a chance to try it and it influences my opinion I will edit this review.edit: I've become aware that the multiplayer is friends-list invite only. This seems a little restrictive, but there you go.As for any possible changes to the game itself, it does feel like they changed a few minor parameters here and there from the original game. It is nothing a newcomer would notice, and overall the game is the same, but during my playthrough for example there were no large number of Heavy Machine Gun items spawning during the fight with the clones in the Final Mission, nor did the piranna give a large amount of bullets on the boat in Mission 1. Again, these are tiny things most players wouldn't notice, but they are there. Fortunately the number of these is very small and was probably done for game balance.As for game options, the game has a standard Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard setting. Each game gives the player 20 credits with three lives each, and this cannot be altered in the settings. I always think it's a little strange to not have a menu option to adjust credits from few to infinite, but this does not significantly alter the game. A reasonably skilled person can get through the game in 20 credits just fine. Even if a player is having trouble, there's an option to begin the game from a stage further along, and there should be no difficulty in starting a game on the Final Mission and playing through if you just want to see the ending.Overall, this is possibly the best port of Metal Slug 3 I have ever seen. It has the original pixel-artwork, it gives the player a reasonable amount of credits to win the game, and it performs very well. Its performance is perhaps second only to the PS3 port of Metal Slug 2 with the overclocking set on, but it may even beat that. The only real regret (besides the various changes) is that it does not include the extras 'Fat Island' and 'Storm the Alien Mothership' mini-games that were present only in the Xbox and JPS2 ports of Metal Slug 3, but that may have been too much to hope for.I recommend buying this game. I hope this release brings a success that convinces them to eventually bring all Metal Slug games to Steam."

For anyone that is interested and/or has bought this game make sure to check out the options menu because there is an AutoFire option under the Key Configuration menu for both Player 1 and Player 2 if you so desire.  Otherwise you will be mashing your keyboard/controller repeatedly to continuously fire your weapon.If you are looking for some old school arcade nostalgia this is an excellent game.

In addition, there's multiple routes through the same level for those looking for a challenge. A pleasant change from the arcade game is a difficulty choice, as well. There's online co-op with friends, a nice art gallery that unlocks as you play the game, and the music is fantastic. Did I mention the awesome boss fights?Only con for me is the coin system, not too sure how it works but it's unlike the arcades where I could add more quarters and continue on. Continues are limited.I rate this game up as a masterpiece, and very much worth the low price.

The game is very unforgiving, often killing newcomers to the game in a matter of seconds, and requiring many playthroughs of the game to even move a few more inches than your last run; however, this difficulty curve is part of the game's charm.Metal Slug 3 rewards players by one of two ways: One: Finding POWs hidden in each level - which, although optional - is crucial to not only racking up a high score, but crucial to survival, as POWs drop various weapons to give you an advantage, such as some POWs dropping a special weapon or grenades before entering a very difficult section. Two: Every Metal Slug game features multiple paths in each level, granting you a choice on how YOU want to approach the situation. An example of this is the mummy portions in Stage 4; while normally you can simply run through one of two paths in the level - one focusing on twitch reflex, and one focusing on platforming skills - you can take the option of finding a slight homage to Metal Slug 2's mummy stage. This sub-level is COMPLETELY OPTIONAL, provides you with no extra benefits to the boss fight at the end, and is very challenging. However, if you want a higher score - and trust me, you will - you'll want to give this level a try - if not - you'll pry want to discover it, just because of natural curiosity.The music in the game is very nice, although, this port's tracks seem ever-so-slightly faster than the original ones, as stated above, although, this is minor. Metal Slug has always had a very top-notch sound design, and the music is easy to remember, catchy, and also helps set the mood for what's going on, on screen, such as Level 2 having a somewhat dark and grungy, horror-like tone to help bring out the zombies and mystery that surround the level, leading up to a very ambient and silent track for the boss fight, which can put you on edge as you lob grenades and pot-shots off, dodging and hoping for a good pattern. Sound in the game, in general, is very satisfying, with explosions sounding beefy, bullets sounding fast and vicious, and painful death-screams sounding painful and raunchy, helping to bring out the carnage of the game - but never does the game feel serious, because let's face it, there's nothing funny about a man being lit on fire at point blank range and having his skin melt away, leaving behind only his bones and ashes - which you'll simply run past as you do the same thing to his fellow comrades and once-friends... but... it's fun in Metal Slug, because it's got a certain lightness and dark-comedy about it.The charm of Metal Slug (as a series) is best stated as such: simple. It's not too dark, it's not too funny, it's not too difficult, and it's not too linear to where you play the same thing - every time. It's got a simple style to it, like most quarter-suckers of the time, and is easy to pick up and play, and also will remind people of classic games such as the Mega Man and Contra titles.Even though this isn't a ""free play"" version of Metal Slug 3, it's worth owning, and even though this port is great, nothing can compare to the thrill of playing this game on a Neo Geo machine, in a pizza parlor, arcade, or fun center - but - hopefully this inspires someone to give this game - if not, the series - a try.Thank you, very much."

Things that've been added are Online Multiplayer, Resolution, Screen Aspect(which I found does nothing different on either setting, so the aspect lies with the Resolution, not with ""screen aspect""), Sound settings and such, but what I found nice is Auto-Fire. Without it, this game is a total and utter button smasher and thumb killer. With Autofire, you don't have to worry about that, just hold fire and it'll let loose bullets at max speed.Otherwise, graphics, sounds, and mechanics haven't been touched one bit, so expect the arcade experience. The game starts you off with 20 credits, essentially what should be about $10 dollars worth if you were at a real arcade.

Well it depends if you liked the original arcade version because nothing really changed. This version has very few additions and features that set it apart from the arcade version though. For one, you play with either the keyboard or with a controller. Second, the game features online co-op play. UNFORTUNATELY, the game has no servers whatsoever so in order to play co-op you are required to friend someone who has a copy. Fortunately, there is local co-op in the game for some one-to-one action. There are two modes included: Arcade Mode and Mission Mode. Arcade mode gives you 20 credits to start with each time you decide to play. No, you can't change the number of credits but it is what gives this game its challenge even on Easy difficulty. Mission mode is where you can select any one of the 5 missions in the game.At about $8 the game is a bit pricey right now. To be honest it is a tough sell if you already have the Metal Slug Anthology. Fans of the series should get this and is recommended for first timers in the series as this one is the best. Though I'm hoping that they add servers for easier co-op play and another mode to challenge veterans of the series."

The game is short and can be beat in one sitting from mission 1 to 5 however, being an arcade shooter, this isn't so much of an issue (especially if you get the game at a price you're willing to pay). With multiple routs in each mission, it adds a degree of replay value by fighting new enemies in new environments. For $8 I'd say it's a bit steep but definitely worth getting if you're a big fan or wait for it to go on sale. All in all I like the game, definitely a sale purchase if you're interested in it and it really makes me hope for the Anthology or even other single titles to make it to Steam in the future!"

It's arcade action at it's fastest, dumbest and finest. It's short, but it's makes up for that with it's hectic pace and incredible level design. Each level presents multiple routes, each offering it's own variety and strategy. Do you want to go with the submarine, blowing up gigantic eels with torpedos and flechettes, or do you want to blow the hell out of boats and tanks frenetically shelling you with artillery? Both are intense and fun as hell. I'd rather not spoil most of this for you, it's something you need to discover for yourself, but expect every level to mix it up in almost every way possible.Not to mention this game is absolutely beautiful. The music, the art, the animation. There's a reason this game is a gem and you should definitely try it out.The only problems i've had with this version is it's lack of update to 4-player co-op (2 is all it offers) and a shaky online system.I highly recommend jumping in."

Still, if you want to see a shining example of run-and-gun excellence, check out SNK Playmore's Metal Slug 3. Originally released on the Neo Geo in 2000, Metal Sug 3 ranks as one of the greatest examples of the side-scrolling shooter genre. You have tight controls, lots of useful weapons (there's no bad ones in the bunch!), branching paths, lots of bad guys to blast, killer tunes, and unique Metal Slug vehicles that let you unleash big damage.Oh, and it's hard. Diamond hard.Metal Slug 3's arcade roots are on display here as death comes from nearly every angle. One does not simply cakewalk through Metal Slug 3. Fortunately, SNK Playmore included a Free Play option that grants unlimited lives and continues. They're very much needed.The games has incredibly detailed graphics and great animation; in fact, it has animation that outshines some 2D games made today! There's even an option to add scanlines to recreate the arcade monitor look. The one visual drawback? The color pallete can be a bit dull in places. But when you consider that Metal Slug 3 was created to run on a console/arcade machine released in 1990, it's easy to overlook the color limitations.If you're looking for a game that satisfies your video game bloodlust, then purchase Metal Slug 3. Watch Nazi analogs get shredded by a shotgun NEVER gets old."

You'll go through dozens upon dozens of continues playing this as it's basically designed around you pouring more and more quarters into the arcade machine. The bosses are pure bullet sponges that you just keep on pounding with whatever gun you have available while they keep killing you, until their hitpoints are eventually drained. Other enemies swarm you in such a pattern that no matter how hard you try, you eventually die. You have a single hit point, so you will die a lot.That means that the challenge is purely artificial. but on the bright side you feel proud of yourself if you manage to stay alive for more than 5 minutes at a time (I'm not kidding either).It's also over incredibly quick. There are 5 stages, none of which lasts longer than around 20 minutes, unless you're a masochist and switch the default unlimited continues off, at which point I would imagine the game is in fact unfinishable."

Everything that is happening on screen is interesting and you really want to spend time looking at all the things happening around you.At the same time the game is inhumanly hard. Without infinite credits its unlikely anyone could get to the end of the level and kill the boss.  I have played it on medium and with a keyboard, the latter may be my problem. So I could be wrong in its inhuman difficulty. A controller might offer a better time.As button mashers go, it will allow you to happily disassociate from your day to day, focusing on rampant blasting and grenande throwing instead.Since the game play was too 'BANG! BANG! die..repeat,' I can't recommend it as I would other games where some level of skill brings you hours of fullfilling play time. If you're looking for a casual button masher with great looking scenery then METAL SLUG 3 is that game. Otherwise you might be disappointed."

Well, sort of.This game is enjoyable, go ahead and pick it up if it is under 10 bucks, it is certainly worth that much, HOWEVER, the game seems to be designed around dying multiple times per level and that is really frustrating.I would love to see someone get through an entire level without dying, I don't think it is possible. Continues are infinite so lives don't matter and the game seems very aware of this and exploits it. It is required to lose numerous lives to beat any level. This is a game mechanic that I just can't quite understand. If continues are infinite and you have to die multiple times, why not just increase the health of the player or decrease the amount of damage they take to avoid the obnoxious and constant ""Continue?"" ""Choose Character"" menus./endrant. So aside from this, you eventually learn to deal with how the game treats player deaths and you learn to exploit it as well. Infinite deaths = infinite grenades since you spawn with a new set each time so you spam grenades 24/7. What it amounts to is mindless, action packed, carnage and fun for anyone who enjoys 2D side-scrolling couch co-op shooters."

Considered by its many of its fans as the best of the series.This is not a game for casuals though, 20 credits is far from sufficient for anybody who has no experience in this series, but more than enough for anyone after some practice. And there in lies its true replayablility, practicing it until you can pull a Mike Uyama and use only one credit, the one you start with, never dying and never making your reserve credits drop below 20.So buying this is already cost effective, the heyday of arcades may be long past buy even an older console copy of this would have paid for itself obscenely quickly in saved credits.Multiplayer needs MUCH fixing in terms of latency and frame issues still but if you got your buddy sitting next to you like the old days instead of him being in his house and you in yours, you should be good to go.A wonderful purchase for those who knew this series in it's original time, and who want to obey the rules of that time.

,Recommended,250180,10821434,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,Dat Necron Boi!!!,"EDIT (12/11/2014): The game recently got a patch that contributes GREATLY to the gameplay settings as you now can set freeplay and change the number of credits you can have if you want to play with limited lives, it also has fixed the severe framedrop issues that used to happen sometimes (or at least the ones I experienced). However, there is still the issue with the lack of settings on certain aspects and the sound still gets weird at times, but the patch really did good to this game, to which I can now recommend it to people out there. I'm keeping the original review to keep the in depth analysis.I bought the game having the joy of thinking that a legit PC port of my favorite Metal Slug would have been awesome and therefore I bought it.Doing so only left me with some buyers remorse and a lot of dissapointment.While I enjoy the action on the screen and the game itself plays just fine for me, the port itself really is a bare-bones, minimal effort, and extremely basic one.For one, and this is something that I find ridiculous, the game suffers from massive framedrops and severe skips that makes for a jarring gaming experience. To avoid this I had to turn off the ""special effects"" and graphical settings that the game allegedly has (which to me are barely noticible).The games features are also greatly lacking: there are only the campaign mode and the mission select mode. That's it, nothing more.While that isn't exactly something bad, given that the game is just something made for an arcade, but I remember way back when the PSone port of Metal Slug X had a special challenge mode in which the player would face a specific task that made the game had a little variety, and it's kind of surprising that nothing more, not even that simple challenge mode, was added to this port when the console port was made years ago.Yes, the game has an art gallery, but that was also on the PSone port, and it's kind of cheap to see that some of the images found on the console port are actually in this port as well (and I'm under the impression that the console port's art gallery had even more images that the one presented here).Another ridiculous thing is the severe lack of settings. The game is amazingly loud, and in a hilarious manner there are no sound settings. The graphical ones are extremely basic (only two things can truly be modified, and they only go ""on"" and ""off"".The gameplay settings are also missing: no freeplay, no control over how many credits can be had, and no control over how many lives per credit as well.The game's sound is hilariously mangled. It's music goes at erratic speeds (even sounding wrong at times), and some sound effects are butchered to the point that you start making yourself the ""is it the game or is it my hardware?"" question.All of this turn into incredibly ridiculous problems when you compare them to the fact that none of this happened to the original arcade game, especially considering how old the game is, on what hardware it was originally at, and even how superior the old PSone console ports are to this one. It's really baffling how lackluster this port is.I never really tried it online, so I can't offer an opinion there.The game itself, however, is playable on single player no problem, and you still get some kicks out of the game, but it really isn't what one, as a fan of the series, was expecting.I can recommend this game to those who just want a little fun out of it from time to time, but to the true Metal Slug fans out there, I can't recommend it, it just feels too flawed at times.Hell, you can play it on all of its original glory on the MAME or any arcade emulator! And those are from years ago as well! How are the problems of this port even possible?As I said, it is playable and fun, but it has too many flaws to be easily ignored. I can only hope that these probles go away in future updates, if they happen that is."

Metal Slug 3 is the best one in the series, with the best level design, enemy placement, background art, and even having branching paths. The music goes great with the heavy action gunplay, and playing Co-op is always fun, as this game is straight to the action, and you dont have to sit through cutscenes.

Simply put, this game will f*ck you up.But, if you do have the stomach & fortitude to persevere (you WILL die a lot), Metal Slug 3 provides a solid hour or two of non-stop shooting, jumping, screaming wet-your-pants action that very few games of today can match, or even come close to.So if you got some chump change handy & an hour to burn, buy it, give it a go."

Old school gamers will remember the good old days where we recklessly kill enemies and funny bosses in the most outrages way with crazy weapons and vehicles. I remember not being able to get into any vehicle presented before me in the N64 except Metal slug series games. It truly give you the feels of freedom. Sadly the game only had 5 long chapters. Also, it's brutally difficult, but with the update, casual gamer today can now experince what game entertain us everyday we return from school or work. It's at a decent price too. Hopefully steam can release all the games in the future.

Today i started with a statement but i will continue with a question. Isnt Metal Slug 3 (MS3) one of the best oldschool platformers ever?!?!?!? I recently bought it on sales.And its not that i have never played MS3 before, I played it at the arcade cafes when our now poor country had draxmes as currency using coins of 0.50 (which is about 0.17euro now) I played it later using 0.50 euros this time (iflation, what can u say?) and after these kind of stores closed cause the internet got in our lives i played it using MAME emulations.Now i upgraded to windows 8 and i dont have time to bother with programs, cracks, plugins etc... so i just bought it to play it again. 2euros almost as  i recall. And so u know with 2 euros with 0.50 the 2 lives, 2e mean 8 lives so to make it simple play it on arcade and if u are a veteran of the series like me u could ""almost"" end it if you are new, well have fun with the 1st stage...Totally worth the value for money, totally worth the fun and if play with a friend well even more fun :)If u wonder why i bought it again, Its a pure fun masterpiece which makes me nostalgic of my childhood and i would play it any time anywhere, So buy it and have fun.

Now, I spent most of my time playing this game on the XBox, stoned, with my cousin, but the only reason we didn't fire up the NES to play Contra instead was because of the obvious level of dedication the makers of this game.Originally, this game was meant to be put into arcades and munch quarters, and by jove it did its job well. So well, in fact, that it's made its way to consoles and PC. Now, there's not much to a sidescrolling shooter. You walk to the right, you shoot stuff, you get to a boss at the end of the level. Any company can slap that formula together for a mild hit, but SNK took that to the next level.Not only do you getwildlydifferent settings to blow up and conquer, but they even went so far as to make sure that every piece of every level fit when it came to setting, difficulty, and variances in gameplay. It's like the dev's would actually sit around and play the levels they just made and had whole meetings about, ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if....?""For instance, Stage 2 is the zombie level. If you get hit with zombie puke, you don't die like you would in any other level.They turn you into a damn zombie, instead.Then, you get to trudge around slowly, hoping you find the drop that turns you back into a human. Oh, and your bombs? Those turn into screen-wide blood barfs. Every level has weird minor-mechanics that make every level memorable, without feeling overly-gimmicky.The only downside to this game is that you're mainly going to be shooting the same, vaguely nazi-ish soldier MOST of the time. That's not to say that there isn't any variety to the enemies, but for being a cabinet game, it's feasible to assume that those soldiers get re-used due to the limited memory available at the time the game was created. One look at the detail that they put intoevery single graphical asset, and the notion emerges into the realm of possibility.On the up-side, however, these enemies only really seem to be used as filler between set-pieces where you will encounter unique enemies that are specific to each level.  Also, there seems to be some AI differences between the levels that keep even these filler enemies feeling fresh and appropriate to the setting.In tradition with keeping everything else about this game tight, the controls were no exception. You've only got a few skills to master, like: jump, shoot, aim, and throw bombs. Actually, that's it in a nutshell. And the glorious thing about it is that there'szerolearning curve. The first time you do any of those things, you've got it down, and it evenfeelslike it's working perfectly. There's no guessing on jumps. There's no wondering if that bomb is going to hit right. It's like putting your socks on before you put on your underwear; it just feels good.On top of all of this, the developers realized that when the game is ported, the main goal isn't to eat quarters anymore. So, once you beat a level, you can start from there if you happen to ""Game Over"" in the next. Of course, you don't get to keep your score, but if you have a favorite level, or you just want to see what comes next but can't do it from all the way at the beginning, you can pick up anywhere you want - assuming you've at least beat the level once, of course.This is a game that SNKclearlyput their love into - and it shows. It's challenging for all of the right reasons, the graphics and sound are a perfect fit, the controls feel like you've been playing for years from day one, and the best part is that it's only eight bucks. Thirteen if you buy the two-pack. With over 300 games in my Steam Library, there are few that I would label as a staple. This is one of them."

MS3 is my favorite (so far) of the Metal Slug series. The mechanics are a bit smoother than the past titles (like MSX) and I remember it the best from my childhood. I feel like I'm cheating myself whenever I die because I don't have to put in quarters. The game whether it's on sale or not is a steal for the price.

The classic gory arcade side-scrolling shoot-em-up. How could you go wrong?Well for one thing, the game decides that you only need a finite number of credits to make it through the game.Honestly, I'd like a mode where you have infinity credits. Metal Slug is a challenging game! Even if you get the pattern down, you still struggle. I have difficulty finishing it.Other than that, a decent port and a good game*NOTE* I recommend getting a controller for this game. The keyboard controls are fine and easily adjustable, but if you want to play with a friend on the same computer, a controller is necessary."

Arcade games are amazing, and theMetal Slugseries is some of the best for system games. I spent alot of time in the 1990s enjoying this series, at pizza parlors or even video arcades. This port was a nice match for a nostalgia game with a casual bent, the port has a very easy scroller 2d world. This casual game however is pretty detailed in terms of the twitch requirements to conquer the game, just like the old arcade system series titles. If you enjoyed theMetal Slugfranchise,Metal Slug IIIwould make a good steam sale investment.MY RATING : 7/10"

If that's the case, if you love 2D retro shooters, such as Contra, GET IT! There, done, you got your answer. Now, if you like decently long reviews, going on about different points of the game, please read on.Gameplay:Now, this game is, as I said, a 2D retro shooter based on the arcade game of the same name. You go shooting through every levels, killing enemies, finding upgrades, and beating the end boss of every levels. I LOVE this game, the levels are extremely creative, and you won't think any level's the same. There a good amount of enemies, and you'll have fun blasting through them left and right. The bosses are great too, giving you a great challenge before starting the next level.Controls:The controls are simple, and very easy to understand. You use (I'm explaining Xbox 360 controller controls, BTW.) the left analog stick to move your character, use the A button to jump, the X button to shoot, and the B button to use your grenade. (I may be wrong, but that may be cause that's the way I set them up in the menu, so I apologize.) I love a game that isn't complicated with controls, so it's a plus for me, and hopefully you.Difficulty:Hot damn is this game difficult. Now, I'm more of a platformer adventure kinda gamer, but I did really want this game since I can't get the first Metal Slug on my Sega Saturn, so I bought it. Long story short, thank God there's an unlimited lives mode, cause I suck as this game, to say the least. You have a one hit insta kill. So you need to be sure to prepare for anything that may come at you. Now, if you're some kind of seasoned pro at these types of games, by all means get it, you'll probably have a blast with it. As for people who are just getting into this game, such as myself, prepare to die ALOT! So, in conclusion, this game is extremely difficult for people like me, but that isn't even a negative to the game as I love a good challenge. So, I still do recommend it to seasoned pros and novice players alike.So there you go, my personal review of Metal Slug 3, I love this game, and with local multiplayer how could you say no? Playing as zombies and throwing up blood after getting bit is a joy with a friend. And it's arcade perfection, so you don't miss out on anything when it came out. So get this game, and I'll be giving another review on Metal Slug X whenever I get it."

Derpy,"Focusing on fun before logic, the Metal Slug franchise loves to throw you into the fray, showing off the different kinds of things it can throw right at you. As a result, in Metal Slug 3, you'll be fighting mutant crabs, zombies..honestly, the list goes on! That's what I love so much about this game. It takes it to the extreme! Having played Metal Slug 3 as a kid, I can surely say that the buy was worth it. Not only did I get to relive my childhood memories, but I also got to master the game that took blood, sweat, and tears for me to beat as a kid. Having spent 60 full hours into the game and getting all of the achievements, I believe I used my money well.I guess the only downside to it is that it's a bit short, since it's an arcade game. The game focuses on replayability, since it's excruciating your first time in and it expects you to continue to try after hundreds of deaths. After a while though, you get used to it and realize what to do in each level. That, and port issues messing with the music, making it, most of the time, sound offbeat.In short, the game's really fun for an arcade 2-D shooter, even though port issues and it being brutally hard can push some people away. For those buying: Forget logic, just blow stuff up and have fun!"

It's far from the original concepts and frankly, I was perfectly fine both prior and after purchasing it because of the gameplay value it has.It's NOT a copy and paste of the original and it has more characters to select each with their own sort of personality (but not so much gameplay).If you eat too much food (which serves as points with no true value at all) you become fat making you a bigger target and have new animations and speeds of jumping, falling, and running. If you become infected by a zombie your grenades are replaced with almost an entire screenwipe of a blood vomit spewing from your mouth.Not to mention if you become a mummy your movement when walking is severely hindered and your aiming is very stiff, however you can jump rediculously high.In terms of weapons, it has a larger arsenal of weapons from grenade launchers, a gun that drops small propelled vehicles that explode on contact with an enemy, and a beam weapon.If there is one critcism I have in the weapon diversity, obtaining them is a bit too few and far between. I do indeed miss getting shotguns and rocket launchers as frequently as they spawned in the original game. You'll only use those weapons once or twice every two stages.With barely any story value whatsoever the gameplay is what defines these arcade games, so do bare that in mind prior to purchase. It's intended to kill you in one shot. It's intended to barely have any cutscenes. It's intended to have very simple controls. It's an arcade game that has been ported to PC and it's done so almost perfectly.I still wish there was an anthology that you can purchase but this varient alone is worth my money, in my eyes.I HIGHLY reccomend it to fans of 90's to early 2000's aracade games, people who just want a good relaxing game beyond the AAA shooter of today, and who like the concept of having unlimited ammunition in a revolver whiler soaring through the sky like a rocket man.You can beat the game (albiet die almost every minute) in roughly an hour or so. Again, it's a port of an arcade game that was supposed to be short, sweet, and increasingly difficult as the game progresses. But it's one of my go-to games when I feel unsatisfied or frusterated with most modern titles.Not to mention the COOP just extends the fun to be had in almost every way.In a single sentence: ""Absurdity, oddity, hilarity, Metal Slug 3 8s mixed with great gameplay for a long lost era for most modern gamers""."

Many fond memories tackling this game with my friend on the xbox version in his college dorm room.This game has everything i love.  Satisfying exploration; each of the levels offer varying paths, leading to surprisingly different game play elements, either through enemy variation, or having levels designed around a gimmick like underwater or airborne.  And all of the levels are filled with secrets, or rewards that require planning in advance, like saving a particular weapon or vehicle until a certain section.  The gunplay is quite fun.  Each weapon, though represented by sprites, has a certain feel.  The ""Rawket Lawn Chair"" feels quite different from the Shotgun, or the Laser.  You have to change up your play style subtly in order to effectively use the weapon against the enemies.  Each level also offers POW's, hidden characters you can save that usually yield points, weapons, and more.  I love that the game also features many instances to deploy one of the infamous Slugs, whether it bet the classic SV-001 or the adorable Ostrich Slug.Great Soundtack.  That seriously needs to be mentioned.  And varied! Certain sections have specific tunes, so playing different paths creates a varied visual, aural, and gameplay experience.I Love this game.  There are very few games i can truly say that of.  If this game were a person, I would be married to it.  And maybe a few others.  Like Dark Souls (Ooohhhhh, Dark Soulllsss...). Super Meat Boy.  Pokemon would be a filthy side-piece that i can't help but ""visit"" from time to time, at a seedy hotel.But I digress.  Look at this f*cking game in action!  It's a visual feast!  Get it based on that!Also this game is difficult.  You will die a lot. A lot. Luckily, unlimited continues will allow you to see the end, eventually, after dying countless times.  If you want any sense of reward, Limit the continues.  I've had my fair share of experience in this game from my college days, so when i purchased the pc version, i opted to limit the continues to 5, and play from the beginning every time.  It helps serve as a progress marker in the game, by noting at which levels/sections i have x continues left..  Of course, that is how I enjoy the game, your mileage may vary.So yeah, get this game.  I cannot say it's the ""best""  Metal Slug game, but it's certainly my favorite.  Certainly top 5 game contender of my lifetime."

Heck, it even has online multiplayer, what more do you need to know.It's been so long I almost forgot how relentless this game can be. It is classified as a type of Shoot 'em up (Run & Gun) and for those unfamiliar with it, in many ways it is similar to the even older classic, Contra. ..and if you don't know any of those two games then you're obviously too young to be on my friends list. ..just kidding.The animations are great and the gameplay is as awesome as ever. As far as I can tell, it seems to be a decent port though playing it with the keyboard doesn't feel quite as good as playing it with a controller. The only thing I noticed is, putting it on auto-fire (because I don't want to wreck my thumb) caused a little bit of framerate issues in the later missions when there was a lot of action on the screen. It only occurs for about 1-3 seconds but in a game like this it can pose to be quite an issue which I hope to see patched.Other than that it's (still) a great a game, a classic of the good old days and a must-have for any fans of the genre. The game is pretty difficult even on the normal setting so if you're prone to raging you may not have a good time with it unless you have a friend to share in your pain."

,Recommended,250180,22067211,"Posted: 26 March, 2016",all,Bovine Joni [VC],"A very solid 2-D shooter. This was my first Metal Slug game, and I came away pretty satisfied. The first thing I was reminded of gameplay wise was Contra, which I played a lot of on the NES and SNES. This game is much more frantic though, with seemingly endless waves of enemies with little to no break in the action. At some points it seemed more like a bullet-hell game with everything happening on screen. One gameplay advantage I noticed right away in this game over Contra was a melee attack, giving you a much needed option of defense when enemies get too close. Besides that it’s mostly standard 2-D shooter fare; run right (and sometimes up) and kill everything on the screen with a large assortment of weapons, powerups and vehicles.Visually the game is stunning, with very detailed retro sprite art. The animations are also top-notch with many frames of detailed movement in all characters and enemies. Bosses benefit from this greatly, as the extra attention to detail just amplifies their over-the-top nature. Each level boasts its own overall visual theme and unique enemies, giving a nice variety to the game art.Overall, Metal Slug 3 was a short but sweet experience. It probably won't take you more than an hour to run through it, but given its arcade-y nature that can be forgiven somewhat. Some levels offer alternate paths of progression that may encourage some replayability. Multiplayer is also included if you want to blast away enemies with friends. Recommended for fans of 2-D shooting action."

Game itself works just fine and includes authentic slowdowns, it gives as much graphical options as emulated 2D game can give, controller support is superb and now it has credit amount, difficulty and mission modes that were available in some versions of the game!Though I must say that it would still have been nicer to have collection of these as one game instead and that it's pretty odd to not have OS X, Linux and DRM-Free versions anywhere when they have been available couple times in Humble, but for Windows Steam experience, can't complain much anymore.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Alunperin mielipiteeni tästä pelistä oli se että periaatteessa se oli kasaan kyhätty emuloitu versio joka oli portattu iOS:ltä hyvin pienillä muutoksilla ja moninpelillä.Julkaisusta on nyt muutama vuosi aikaa ja pitää myötnää, että pitää ottaa osa sanoista takaisin ja se saattaa olla rahan arvoinen varsinkin alennuksessa. Peli itsessään toimii hyvin ja sisältää authenttiset hidastukset, se antaa niin paljon graafisia säätömahdollisuuksia mitä emuloitu 2D peli voi antaa, ohjaintuki on loistava ja nyt siinä on credittien määrä, vaikeusaste ja tehtävämoodi jotka olivat saatavilla osassa pelin versioista!Vaikka pitää sanoa että olisi ollut hienompi saada kokoelma näistä peleistä yksittäisten sijaan ja on hieman outoa ettei OS X, Linux ja DRM-vapaata versiota ole saatavilla varsinkin kun ovat muutamaan kertaan olleet Humblessa, mutta Windowsilla Steam kokemuksesta ei voi enää kauheasti valittaa."

,Recommended,250180,33321597,Posted: 6 July,all,Maneauleau,Great game but watch out if you are hoping for smooth coop play via the Steam Link!! The controllers are not working properly. I wish they would fix that :/
,Recommended,250180,33332502,Posted: 6 July,all,Swordsmanship,"Short and sweet, this game makes sure you make every shot and movement count. Casually playing this game is extremely difficult and punishes you when it can. Once you learn the patterns of each level it gets a little easier but will always prove to be a challenge should you choose to get comfortable or careless."

It took me and a friend just under 2 hours to complete in one go. Something about nonstop armies coming at you really makes you wanna keep going!

Hell yes!  Purists will rage, but this would have made the classic into something new without changing anything else in the content. Sooo close!"

(the game gives you the option for infinite continues anyway)I've also heard people complain about emulation being a better experience and this port being bad, but seeing as I haven't seen a single one of those issues yet, I can't speak for that. All I can say is that I haven't noticed a single one of those issues in my time playing."
