It's almost like a fever dream.  Don't read too far into it.  It's incredibly weird, yet somehow entertaining to initially witness.  Sometimes it's unsettling.  Sometimes it's hilarious.  Cynical people will write Jazzpunk off as a simple walking simulator, and, well, they're not entirely wrong.  When you suspend your cynicism, though, you will find a wholly unique, dreamlike game.

,Recommended,250260,15647641,"Posted: 1 May, 2015",all,[AReV]BavarianGod,"The 1960's were a strange time, atomic paranoia fueled the cold war as the space race allowed mankind to make monumental leaps forward technologically. Global espionage was the tool with which the cold war was fought as agents from both of the world's super powers battled for information and technology. Amidst all of this, counter culture exploded and use of psychedelics became a new past time. Jazzpunk uses this period of time as an aesthetic springboard for it's comedic hijinx and in doing so plays out like an episode of Saturday Night Live with an overarching theme to it's skits.It would probably be most appropriate to categorize Jazzpunk as an adventure game, as players are placed in the role of Polyblank, a secret agent who is dispatched from an abandoned subway station on various missions by a character known as The Director and each one of these misadventures is kicked off by swallowing a pill. The narrative is flimsy, and each mission plays out almost like a skit. An antagonist is introduced in the later missions and helps provide some closure to the game's events. Jazzpunk focuses more on humor than plot and it makes this the kind of experience that you turn on, tune in and drop out of. It assaults players with non sequiturs and irreverent easter eggs. Players can expect to stumble across a frogger style mini game, wander around in an Evil Dead inspired setting made out of pizza, play mini golf with a James Bond style villain and beat up a passenger car Street Fighter II style. It's a tribute to all things nerdy with plenty of tech based humor and refrences to other games. The Adult Swim style humor, a style that makes it seem like being in an altered state of consciousness is a prerequisite to enjoy, is likely to put off many.Also potentially off putting is just how easy the puzzles are in Jazzpunk. Most players will find themselves progressing unopposed since most levels are as simple as following the instructions laid out in the objectives screen. There are a handful of side quests but they have no bearing on the proceedings and generally exist to provoke a few laughs. Some of the diversions like Wedding Quake, a wedding themed spoof of the classic arena shooter may hold players attention for a decent amount of time but the whole of Jazzpunk lasts a few hours at most and offers little replayability. Think of Jazzpunk as more of an alternative to watching a comedy film than a game poised to occupy a dozen hours of your life. It could be argued that Jazzpunk is most rewarding when you are avoiding the critical path since interacting with random objects and poking your nose around generally uncovers the best easter eggs and gags.The aesthetics of Jazzpunk leave a favorable impression. Seemingly modeled after Thirty Flights of Loving, it employs blocky characters with simple animations and cell shaded styling. The funky soundtrack adds to the unique flavor of the game making it feel like nothing else as well as helping sell the off beat humor. The aestetics, soundtrack and gameplay click together like legos, delivering a unique experience that in spite of the fact that it borrows liberally from other works.Jazzpunk is kind of a nightmare game for reviewers... To describe it in terms of the quality of it's gameplay, visuals and the amount of time players can wring out of it simply misses the point of the game. Potential Jazzpunk players should think of it instead as an interactive comedy experiment. An off beat experiment. While it may not stand out as a great game it is a little experimental indie gem that may have an impact on the humor and style of other titles. Turn on, tune in and drop out."

If you want something to point at and talk about the importance of games and the artistic potential of the medium or some other frilly nonsense about how special video games are, then this game speaks to that louder than any other.

You are introduced to its Adult Swim-esque humour when your Director requires you to sit on a whoopee cushion in his office that is situated in an abandoned train cart before he explains your first mission to you.Jazzpunkgives you the feeling when you find a secret room or an easter egg in other games, except this time it lasts the whole game.You’ll pillow fight a girl out of a window. You’ll be kissed by a homeless guy. You’ll dig up Han Solo, squirt pufferfish poison into people's faces, shave a man with a weedwacker and have to make your way through a crocodile person’s digestive track.The game seems to be set in an augmented reality based in the 1950’s, an odd and never done before combination. Each chapter ofJazzpunkis fairly open world and requires you to complete an assortment of random tasks using your creativity in order to progress. While these tasks do push the plot forward, they seem only to motivate you to explore and find the secrets and jokes that Necrophone Games have hidden throughout the game.The gameplay is simple and you cannot lose, even when you actually are. After you finish the game you get the option to replay each chapter separately if you’re looking to get those achievements without having to repeat the entire game. In a game dependent on the ‘wow factor’ keeping you entertained the first time you play through it, it’s a wonderful option and certainly is a positive.We all know that achievements games are sometimes tedious and boring.Jazzpunkhas somehow managed to make theirs funny and worth playing through the game again to achieve them all. One of them requires you to dial certain four letter words into a phone booth, while another requires you to paralyze yourself after jumping from a diving board.There are multiple mini games you can complete ranging from zombie pizzas, a cat simulator where you need to destroy expensive items to Wedding Quake (where you kill brides and grooms in order to stay single and collect powerups like a pre-nup) that will keep you on your toes and entertained.Although the last chapter of the game falls short and feels a little disappointing,Jazzpunkis still overall a hilarious game, and everyone should give it a shot.If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!"

So put on your crazy hat, sit back and enjoy.You are Polyblank who is sent on missions to recover some stolen goods and discover some things are not what they seem. There is voice acting while words are projected onto the characters and areas around the screen. You can do weird things like clean out a guy’s bat ears with a giant q-tip you find on the ground. Many funny stuff happens in this game that had me laughing many times. My kids watched some of it too and really got a kick out of it. Why not get in a pillow fight and knock the girl out the window or spray pigeon perfume on someone and watch the pigeons attack. These are just a few funny things to see.The game is short though and can be finished in about 3-4 hours but that won’t take away and fun or experience. The $15 price tag is a little high but if you catch this on sale pick it up because it is a great game to experience. I would have loved to play more and hope maybe the devs will put out some add-on content or maybe a sequel. Probably won’t happen but I can always dream. It reminded me of Thirty Flights of Loving with its art style and somewhat similar story telling. Also if you are an achievement hunter they are all pretty easy to achieve and also fun to earn.

Let me explain.You're a special agent, and you get missions to achieve. Until stuff happen and you have to save someone (I won't spoil it).Yea, the story is pretty weird and not much clear, but it fits into the game perfectly.The style its pretty simple and cartoonish, but really original and good looking, the settings its like a 60s spy movie, with all the prerecorded sounds you have heard in a lot of classic movies (yes, they have the Wilhelm Scream).The humor is great. I love it. It kinda feels a little bit like a Monty Python adventure. It's all set up to take you by surprise, and it works super-well.The gameplay itself it's pretty easy, a sort of first-person adventure game. Even tho looks easy, it's a lot of fun to play. Expecially if you have to pick a nose to open a door or stuff like these.The music is probably the main problem. I mean, it works a lot since it all sounds like a 60s movie, but it's way too ripetitive and loud.Also, it is pretty short. It only took me 2 hours and a half to finish it 100%. And that's a shame, I was seriously hoping to last at least around 5-6 hours.

I could say it's a psychedelic love letter to obscure references; an outrageous consolidation of ridiculous moments and hilarious dialog, brought to life with a bizarre art style and deadpan delivery. But what is Jazzpunk really? Well I guess it's all of these things and so much more; an barrage of creativity held together by forces beyond our understanding. It's insane and absurd, and I love it so much.Set in an alternate history Cold War era Japan, you take on the role of Polyblank: espionage extraordinaire, who has been contracted to obtain confidential information from a top secret soviet headquarters. Utilizing prescription medicine and his many skills, from being able to speak to inanimate boxes to throwing popcorn on fellow theatergoers, he's the obvious man for the job and perhaps the only sane person left in this world (assuming he even is).From the opening moments (which are absolutely brilliant, I might add) Jazzpunk pulls you by the throat down its rabbit hole of computer puns, pigeon degaussing, stick people, and Hunter S. Thompson. It's a mad, mad world that revels in its own absurdity and pulls it off with a consistency and potency that defies reason, but proves nonetheless hilarious and even nostalgic, pulling and referencing things I thought I'd forgotten so many years ago.Jazzpunk exists in a vacuum of its own insanity; a colossus monument to the sheer power of imagination, and perhaps the closest thing to a videogame cult classic I've ever seen. I have no doubts that there will be people that ""just don't get it"", find it too simple a game, or otherwise fail to appreciate its genius and that's fine. It isn't a game for everyone, but for those that harbor a love for technology jokes, deadpan humor, and the plain bizarre, Jazzpunk's surreal brilliance is hard to miss."

I would absolutely recommend this for people who want to experience something completely unique and interesting. I suspect every experience playing this game will be fairly unique given all the various things available to experience during a play through. I think my own weighed in at around 3 1/2 hours or so, but I also didnt do everything in the game. You could literally take in the visuals for a couple hours if you really wanted to.So, definitely play this, but also track the technical issues thread in this games community hub.

And while the art and sound design both are amazing, it ultimately falls short in gameplay, narrative, and cohesion. After the more than stellar introduction to the game’s world, players spend the rest of this two hour long spy comedy pretty much walking around while the premise disappears further and further into the background and the jokes start to wear thin around the middle of it all. Players slip into the role of secret agent Polyblank in a Cold War-esque world and have to retrievethingsfrom the enemy so his organization can doother things. None of it matters, however, as players will shortly lose investment in the story altogether.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679453147Jazzpunklacks an appealing game mechanic but also misses both agency and payoff to compensate for that – meaning that at the end, there is not a whole lot to talk about. Around the third mission,Kai Tak Beach Resort, things start to turn dull as players realize that they have basically seen everything and that the game is not headed anywhere. There are no puzzles, perils, or high points. The areas feel disconnected, talking to non-player characters leads nowhere, several gags are not linked to anything, and some of the quips don’t have any punchlines to them, with a number of them simply referring to things that only make sense if one knows the source material. TheFrogger,Space Invaders, andWave Racesegments try to bring variety to the monotony, but end up feeling very alien, as if they are only in the game because the developers knew how to program them.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679453308ConclusionNecrophone GamesandAdult Swim Gamesdid a phenomenal job with the audio-visual presentation ofJazzpunk. Sadly, as there isn’t anything to do in the game, there also isn’t too much to revisit or to remember either. In my initial playthrough it took around two hours to complete the story and another 2.3 hours to play through it again, this time getting the achievements I missed and attempting to get out of bounds. The game definitely starts off strong and maybe future titles will be able to build on that momentum to create a truly great experience.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679453254"

None of the puzzles are remotely challenging and the game is more or less a Walk To Goofy Setpiece simulator with a few minigames that merely distract. Though the game ends quicker than a run to the Post Office, the jokes are somewhat funny in that Adult Swim brand of humor. Once again your mileage may vary and after the humor the game really doesn't have much going for it. The art style is abstract and engaging, but the world itself is more or less dead and roughly the size of a football field. Before you know it the level is over and even the few 'sidequests' in the game add little substance. That being said, the game is pretty funny, but it begs the question ""Why did I pay for this?"" Even at $15 (or $12 at the time I write this) Jazzpunk seems way too expensive for what it is and feels more-suited to the Flash Game crowd rather than a standalone title. In conclusion, not a bad game, but not worth the money."

Even with the fact that I purchased the game 75% off, the game still fails to deliver what I expected. Maybe it is the fact that I watched a brief video of someone playing it. If you are purchasing this game because your favorite youtuber played itDON'T DO IT. There's no point; you are just redoing those events in the video but in your game. Nothing is different other than the fact that you are just playing it by yourself.But if you're not a doofus like me and you don't watch let's plays or whatever, I could still list off many reasons why to avoid this game, no matter if it's on sale or not. Yes the game has a unique and interesting setting, but they do not utilize it. The map feels very scripted and limited to the point where you know where there's going to be an invisible wall. The maps are based off level by level so you can't really go back or explore. It's just levels. There's few interactivity but everything else you wish you could do, you probably can't. The puzzles are easy and straight to the point. Sometimes I would get stuck because I over-thought one. The jokes are not that funny, and more punny. They are the jokes that make you cringe and sigh at. The comedy of this game may appeal to some, but I did not crack a chuckle. It may appeal to a young child or an autistic grown man-child. A few more things to throw in were that my framerates were always plunging down on some parts. There are some bugs on each level where you could see font from a distance. The sound design (other than the goofy voice acting) is crap, putting annoying ambience noises on loop. The game in general just felt verylinear, scripted, and limited.If I had to compliment one thing, it would be the artwork and the graphics. I like the characters and I think they are silly looking. The environment is basic and colorful. But that's about it.Overall this very short $15 game does not live up to my expectations, and in fact, the game should be cheaper. If you are interested in this game but you don't want to buy it- just watch a video of someone playing and their commentary (doesn't matter who you watch) would be funnier than the game itself."

It's just packed with ridiculous jokes, and I'll say 95% of them connected for me. I was actually laughing out loud for most of the game. However, the game is quite short. It took me less than 3 hours to finish with 100% of the achievements, and I did pretty much everything I could in every level. If you just beeline through the objectives, it'll take you less than an hour and you'll miss most of the content. That would be a terrible way to play this game. It's not long, but it's the kind of game you want to soak up a bit.It's like a more absurd version of Gravity Bone or Thirty Flights of Loving. I definitely recommend it for all of bonkers jokes."

It was released on the 7th February 2014 and has gain a small fan base on Steam, but I believe it deserves more of a following than it has.The game can be run on Windows, Mac or Linux and is not very demanding so you should be able to run it smoothly on any reasonably good computer. As for bugs, I have not experienced any serious bugs or glitches in which I would call important in anyway.Jazzpunk costs £10.99 which I believe is a bit steep, but it frequently goes on offer so if you want to buy it, just wait for one of the times in which it does. Having bought it and played through the story line a number of times I can see why this game has become popular. The joke play style which stays consistent from trailer to end of game is fun and enjoyable for everyone.The music in game suits the style well and adds to the overall enjoyment you get whilst playing the game. On top of this the storyline is engaging and light hearted, and the amount of stuff there is to explore could keep you amused for many hours.However, the game is very short, if you play it through without fully exploring the map you would be able to complete the game in about 2 hours, which is not a lot of game time for the price. However, due to it's comical properties and cleaver design, you will be able to back to it and discover more every time.To conclude, yes I do recommend Jazzpunk and you will enjoy playing it, but that enjoyment may not last as long as you will be hoping when you first buy it, due to it's short story length."

In it you play a spy called Polyblank in what is a spoof of 50's and 60's era spy films. The game is so bizarre it's hard to describe it. It really is one of those things you need to experience for yourself.The basic formula of the game is each level is an open area you can expore through at will and discover the various strange and funny events and mini-games in each level. There are some fun mini-games in this game (Wedding Quake being my favourite) that are parodies of classic games.This is a short game but it is packed with a lot of fun.The Good- This game was a lot of fun to play. Each level has a lot of random stuff to discover.- I enjoyed this games humour. It's a bit off the wall and bizarre which was right up my street.- The visual style of this game really stands out and looks great a bit like a weird Hanna-Barbara cartoon.The Bad- It is pretty short. Even with taking my time and almost fully exploring all the levels my playtime came to just over 3 hours.- This games humour might not appeal to everyone.Overall this was a fun but regrettably short game which i enjoyed a lot more than i expected. 7.5/10

If you know about computers, video games, the 80s and 90s pop culture and current geek pop culture, there's plenty of laughs to be had. Maybe times I caught myself going ""AW YEAH"" while chuckling. Even a few ""I can't believe they did that."".But, in the end, the game is incredibly underwhelming.Under the guise of a 70s-era spy show set in a computer, you find yourself trying to get a russian data tape, then find an old enemy, save yourself and save someone else. And that's it.Lots of slapstick comedy, but... is it worth 15$? No.10$ would have been a steep yet fair price, in my opinion. For two hours of gameplay, if would be on par with a movie admission ticket.But I complain about movies charging more than 10$ for a 1.5 hours running time feature-length movie, I would be remiss in pointing out the same flaws with a video game.If you want to support an indie developper with a great sense of humour, and maybe Jim Sterling at the same time, then go right ahead.However, if you are looking for anything that will ""go the distance"", so to speak, then don't. And that's with the gimmick of ""click on everything at least once"" of exploration games, such as this one.TL;DR:Hilarious if you're a 25-or-plus years old geek, finished awfully and disappointingly fast."

No doubt, the game is pretty odd experience, and from what you've seen it seems like one you cant miss out on. Jazzpunk sports a very cartoon like presentation, which is welcoming with its plot (which is a satire on classic spy movies like james bond). That said, the plot doesn't even really matter, as the main point of the game was to showcase many ludicrous out of place jokes through minigames and tasks you complete. Most of these minigames aren't particularly fun and serve either as punchlines or bizzare humor on their own.(wedding quake was a blast though)  The 3 levels you play in have some explorable areas and characters that you can interact with, but they have very limited responses and are pretty much just one time gags. Controls feel a bit floaty, but I honestly cant complain about that in a game with a length like this one, which leads to another large flaw: Playing and completing the actual game can be as short as 15 MINUTES. Jazzpunk has a shockingly minuscule amount of content for its price, and I felt myself regretting my purchase as the credits rolled in. If a youtube video inspired you to get this game, chances are that video has shown most of what you've already wanted to see in the game. Unless you want to watch the same scripted jokes played out again, its not worth your time or your money.Pros-Gives the player freedom in the environment (no forced actions unless to progress the level)-Is actually quite immersive in a surreal sort of way and lots of things to interact with-Lots of jokes-Lots of referencesCons-Extremely short-Exploration is essentially just finding more jokes-The game can potentially be very unfunny if it's humor isnt your type-The ""Game"" for the most part is not very entertaining as a game-no real reason to replay at allConclusion:Unless you want a very short interactive game that may or may not be funny to you, I would not reccomend buying this except if it is on sale for more than 50% of its price.

Too short for it's undiscounted asking price. The artistic direction is tops, but the actual game design is amateur.WORTH:It's not worth $15.00 USD, plain and simple. A fair amount of my hours came from walkthrough creation, you can expect to beat this game in less than four hours. It sees the occasional sale, but only during the major holidays.OVERALL:Jazzpunk has heavy goals involving ""alternate reality Cold War Cyber-Crime Espionage"" that fall hilariously flat, but it's comedic eyecandy and worth a night of drunkplay with that distinguishable Adult Swim style.SCORE:7/10Full Review Coming Soon"

,Recommended,250260,10746985,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,AssassinGlasgow,"An odd, surreal, colorful world, the first thing you'll notice about this game is just how creatively bizarre it is. It's strangely familiar with many of its elements and homages, and yet when it mixes them all up you still feel a breath of creativeness shine through. If you enjoyed things like old 60's cartoons or shows with their campiness, and love tongue in cheek humour, this is a great game for that. It also reminded me a bit of the Venture Bros., with the tone of everything satirizing and poking fun at the ""cartoons of yesteryear"".The humour and art direction are indeed the strongest points to this game. If you're looking for a plot, however, I would say this doesn't really have much of one, aside from glimpses of the world they live in. The writing is at its strongest with humour, which is what the game 100% is.Unfortunately, the game is very short, at most 2 hours, and not much replay value unless you like to experience it again after a long time or 100% the game. I recommend it solely off of the fact that it is an extremely funny game, but I would not pick it up for its full price of $15. Pick it up for when it's under $5, preferably around $3. It is well worth that price in broken sides and laughs alone."

The controls are super simple, the gameplay is immense, the jokes are nonstop. If you enjoy humor games then you'll want to pick this one up.Of course there are some complaints, so lets go ahead and get those out of our way. Super short, yeah it is. you can speed run it in about 45 mins, and can get all achievements in one run through if you take your time and explore resulting in about 3-4 hours of gameplay. I know right. Secondly, the mouse, you will need to adjust your settings when you first start, put them on the lowest setting you can, otherwise you'll spin in circles. Lastly, some people including myself have reported feeling ill while playing this. Turning off the mouse smoothing option will help, however the game also has a 3D element to it, so that might be whats making people get motion sickness. (but if you have a pair of 3d glasses or can make a pair, it makes the game so much more...insane. Yeah thats a good way to put it.If your young I'll admit you might not get some of the jokes. A lot of the comments and references are from old 70's and 80's films, cartoons and TV shows. Hunter S. Thompson has a nice role in the game, with some great quotes I might add, so that should give you some kind of indication what level of humor we are talking about here. (If you don't know who Hunter S. is, please go watch 2 movies right now, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and Where the Buffalo Roam. His books and articles from Rolling Stone are better but I can't expect anyone to read a book anymore.)So yeah I recommend this game, its funny, it looks great, the soundtrack is great, controls are easy and self explanitory. Only issue is that its super short, (makes Protal 2 look like a long game), and it can make some people feel ill after playing for a while."

The game is about thirty to forty-five minutes long in the story length but you will spend some time admiring the world or just laughing at the random occurences. The story is nothing special but filled with jokes and references to easily find this entertaining. This game does what a video game should do, entertain the player and provide maybe some challenge but makes the experience memorable and fun. I would recommend this game to anyone that wants to just play a casual and humorous game."

Anyway, i really enjoyed this game, visually wise and humor wise. It usually takes alot that an indie game makes me laugh when it atempts humor, and while i didn't laughed out loud once, i got a few chuckles out of it sometimes and found some things pretty funny or amusing, and even that is an accomplishment alone, which i command Jazzpunk for. Otherwise, the whole setting is pretty cool and bizarre, sorta like a take on Soviet Russia, Japan, Cyberpunk and whatnot. I like bizarre/weird Settings anyway so this was a big plus in my book in the first place.I am pretty glad the game is as long as it is, if it would have been longer, i don't think i would have enjoyed it as much after some time. Besides the main game you have short, but nice little minigames to and the also  alot of dialoge with the characters and/or the enviroment itself. If you rush the game and don't talk to anybody, you will be done in an hour i guess, but if you take your time and basically explore everything you get a good few hours counting, atleast for me it didOnce again, i can recommend it, one of the few indiegames i like out there.

The developers behind the game are nothing short of giraffes (so they have long necks, which they use to reach for the stars) bringing their dreams into reality with vigor. The trailer for this game says it all, perfectly displaying the succulent confusion and disarray found while playing “Jazzpunk.”Brilliant 4k graphics power the thousand upon thousands of artists’ careful drawings and 3D models to create a gorgeous mosaic of infinite, cell-shaded beauty. The color scheme forms a delicious kaleidoscope of iconic tones and shades, each with its own scrumptious flavor. Despite this, the game runs as smoothly as a buttered Usain Bolt across an ice-skating rink (which is to say, it does, unless the ice skating rink is actually a blender). Jazzpunk has an art style that doesn’t require Prozac to be enjoyed, but also isn’t so erratic and screwball that you feel like you pumped six graves of lysergic acid diethylamide into your forearm. Its simplistic touch leaves the connoisseurs of gaming in awe.Upon further inspection of the penultimate[1] gameplay, one can determine the true quality of the masterful plotting of its characters. As a wise man once said, ""Procrastinator [Pro-Krazt-Ih-Nay-Tor] derived from the Spanish word 'procratelémathíon' meaning 'midnight snack' and the Viking word 'Astenetorr' meaning 'puckered cheeks'... it basically describes someone who sits on a sandwich in the dark."", which is what one will be doing when experiencing the masterpiece that is this, not a game, but rather an alternate existance of profound truth and mythicality.Jazzpunk’s potential in the competitive scene is enormous. The flawless game mechanics permit the player to glide from location to location without the clunkiness seen so commonly in modern games. The combat is another reason this game is worth $202 dollars as the fighting mechanisms allow for a proper demonstration of the skills and reflexes of professionals in the global scene. In fact, major league gaming clans such as PhaSe, OcUlar, MNiac, Cloud7, and Crew Dual-LeftLane have already started up Jazzpunk teams. The new “dank” and “lit” montages are set to be out on the 31st of February.When one is inserted into the world of Jazzpunk, the are instantly greeted with the beautiful scenery of 1900s Sweden. This paragraph exists just to make sure you are still reading. I’m going to add a couple lines of gibberish that look correct, but upon closer inspection make no sense. When taking the VX6 processor into the quad-core bi-angular Veridian thermal anti-hydroxium chip, you must apply substatic stabilization to the Coriolis equation otherwise you would almost certainly have an input of null! Don’t forget to integrate the XL-3SD's post-core crandents via a tangential crosswire with the multi-optic separators in the Mornington model center fluxes. We can now change the state of the matter into to a Ziemann-Ulseid machine. Ending with the great frog race and the crocodile chase, it is a wacky game indeed. ~(^.^)~For all my Turkish friends...

Not only are you subject to every single individual playing your game's unique sense of humor, but there's also the fact that not a lot of videogames are very funny.Jazzpunk is pretty funny. From the get-go, it fires off visual gags, humorous audio, and strange dialog and rarely ever lets up. With the frenzied pace, the game could have easily spread itself too thin, but almost all the material in the game is executed very well. Sometimes far too well. Sometimes a completely innocent and almost throw-away joke will spiral out into a complete mini-game of its own. I'm hesitant to spoil anything simply because I feel the jokes and random asides in the game should be witnessed first hand, but I will say that it'll be hard to think of wedding cakes the same way again.The game thrives on the absurd and your willingness to poke around each world to find that absurdity. If you just rush through each stage's set objective, you'll be missing the point, and all the fun entirely. The Achievements List is a fantastic way to get as much as you can out of Jazzpunk as it encourages that kind of exploration over simple ""progress"" based objectives.If you enjoyed last year's The Stanley Parable, then Jazzpunk is most definitely for you. If absurdist humor, dark comedy, and anti-humor aren't your thing, it may be best to pass this one by."

Interactive pun simulator? Burroughs-em-up? It's a distracting and fairly enjoyable little thing, but this is ultimately a once only experience. I wouldn't recommend dropping more than £5 on this if you can avoid it given a loose £/hr enjoyment ratio you can get everywhere else.I'm all for doing something a bit different within the concept of a 'game'. What Jazzpunk provides is an on-rails 'experience' telling a somewhat surreal story laced with puns and references to hard-boiled detective fiction and gaming staples and offering up a few puzzles to solve on the way.Whilst never exactly actively bad it does suffer from being overly drawn out in places and the general pacing feels a little disjointed. The puzzles seem to actually get less difficult as the story progresses, perhaps this was a intentional 'thing' but if so the point of it was lost on me.If you've played games long enough to anticipate some of the usual game design language (the items hidden in the bind corner, if the game points you left have a quick look to the right, pull the lever that appears to do nothing etc) then don't bother chasing after the intriguing possibilities in Jazzpunk. There a lot of hidings to nothing to waste your time on for no reward.I really am trying to be positive about this game, I'm giving it a thumbs up because it's not actiively awful.What there is is very nicely made, there's nothing technically wrong with it, but ultimately when reaching the end I was just left with a general feeling of ""Oh.

,Recommended,250260,9026898,"Posted: 8 February, 2014",all,Dr. Fortyseven,"A while back, when I saw the trailer for ""Thirty Flights of Loving"", I was excited by the abstract, highly stylish visuals.  It looked like a seriously unique, undeniably ""indie"" experience, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.Players heaped praise on the game, finding deep meaning inside the painfully short experience.  I was not one of those people, unfortunately.  I found ""Thirty Flights..."" to be a shallow proof of concept, at best -- something the developer himself seemed to admit from the commentary track.  I walked away from the game bitter, having felt duped by popular opinion.That said, I very much liked the IDEA of ""Thirty Flights"": an interactive book.  A way of telling a unique, linear story, letting the player guide the narrative along at their own pace.  (Adding VR into the mix will take this immersive idea even further, but I'm getting ahead of myself.)As it turns out, the game I was hoping ""Thirty Flights"" would be, is what ""Jazzpunk"" actually *IS*.Both games are very strange, unique, linear short stories, but ""Jazzpunk"" gives you a bit more freedom to explore, with side-quests and mini-games here and there along the way.What separates the two further, is that ""Jazzpunk"" is straight up hilarious and wonderfully strange.  More times than I can count, I found myself wide-eyed, staring at the monitor and going ""whaaat!"" with a huge smile.Additionally, there are numerous references, both popular and obscure, to old technology (Captain Crunch's famous 2600 whistle, for example), and the culture around them.  Raymond Scott's unmistakable trademark musical style heavily influences the proceedings (not to mention directly referenced here and there).While I damned ""Thirty Flights"" for being criminally short for the price, I found ""Jazzpunk""'s short length to be JUST long enough without overstaying it's welcome.  A $10 pricetag would probably be more comfortable than $15, but the effort and love that was clearly put into this...well, I wouldn't at all feel ripped off if I'd paid full price.I'd absolutely love to see this expanded into an ongoing series, with each installment being just as short but sweet.4/5"

It's really fun to look at, it's odd and absurd, which is great, but for me it goes nowhere with it.I am going to give it a thumbs down because: 1) It takes no effort or thought to play.  I have clicked everything, played all the mini games, searched every corner, gotten all the achievements and feel like I didn't do anything worthwhile when all is said and done.  2) The humor was not my kind of humor and it's unrelenting.  That's a problem since humor seems to be half the game content (the other half are the visuals).  For the most part, it is a continuous stream of computer-geek puns. IE: You go into a restaurant and the waitress says ""I will be your dedicated server.""  Lots and LOTS of that. There is almost no dialogue per se, just a lot of word play.  3) The game made me feel ill which really surprised me.  If you play for more than 30 minutes in a go, especially after the first chapter, most likely you will end up with a degree of motion sickness no matter how rarely you get it in real life.  This game could probably be weaponized for that ability.  4) The game is very very short, though given everything else, that is sort of a plus.I kept expecting something in the game to wow me, to grab me mentally at least once, but nothing ever did.  It's colorful fluff.  If you like computer puns and pure silliness -- you'll probably have a great time.  If you want more from a game than just being taken on a ride, or if puns make you roll your eyes and sigh in annoyance -- then you probably want to give the game a miss."

,Recommended,250260,9060886,"Posted: 11 February, 2014",all,granderojo,"Jazzpunk is a comedy in the burgeoning sub genre of first person games like Gone Home or Thirty Flights of Loving that seek to tell a linear story in a non-linear experience by shepherding the protagonist with incentives. This review is the hardest review I've ever attempted to write. Being a comedy, and a video game, many of the jokes are deadpan and are uniquely structured to the levels of the game. Because of that there were levels that hit the mark, such as Wedding Quake were hilarious. Often times though there were jokes in levels that matched that were nearly identical to each other in structure, cadence and delivery right after each other that were not only not funny but actively served to make subsequent new jokes in that level less funny.This fault of the game seems to be a result of the non-linear structure. Due to it being a non-linear game there are many chances to miss things. Due to this they would reuse minigames and even types of jokes. That said reused jokes can be funny. There are multiple instances where you are sent through a zombie pizza hut minigame trifle, and each time it gave me goosebumps and it would cause uncontrollable laughter. Most of the jokes are not given as much car as the pizza hut gag or Wedding Quake and are mere stand-up routines. There are instances when multiple non-player characters in levels will give similar routines but not quite the same, and these jokes fall flat.Jazzpunk in many ways is a stark realization that game developers growing up playing Nintendo 64 games are now making games of their own. It’s a weird artifact from an era that went in a different direction, when minigames dominated and there were a torrent of incentives deployed at the player character to get them to complete a non-linear environment in a linear way. In the end, what this boils down to is a unique refreshing experience that's comedy doesn't hack it the whole way through."

If there is such a thing as a God, it is Jazzpunk.Jazzpunk is a very much experimental game, infusing just about everything under the sun with puns. Alot of puns. Jazzpunk also incorporates just about any game you can think of into one neat little package. Pizza version of Nazi Zombies. Here. Quake game based around weddings. Here.The story line, while short, is funny and compelling at the same time. The story focuses on espionage, set in a bright world that enfuses new technology with a background of bright, and colourful Art Deco motifs. There is a ton of exploring to do, easter eggs to find, and whole new games to play! If you follow the main story path, you're looking at 2, maybe 3 hours of gameplay. But combined with all the secrets, achivements and down right silly side-quests, you could easily extend your playtime to 4-5 hours or even more!I expected a more Thirty Flights of Loving feel to Jazzpunk, but I was mistaken. Jazzpunk (it's just such a fun word to say) is it's own game, heck, it's own genre. It's much more ""in your face"" than Thirty Flights of Loving, but that isn't always a bad thing. Jazzpunk is just a silly, good time, but doesn't take it too far but actually making all these silly things funny. Granted, you'll need an acute sense of humor to enjoy this game. But I sure enjoyed the hell out of it, and I hope too again soon.+ The jokes are actually funny. No Duke Nukem Forver nonsense.+ The music, art, character and charm of the game are all fantastic.+ Incorporates lots of secrets, mini-games, this game has it all.

,Not Recommended,250260,10117201,"Posted: 15 May, 2014",all,CommanderSheppard,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dU_3GWWZH4Jazzpunk presents itself as a parody of spy movies, but quickly wears out its welcome with never ending references and sight gags, most completely unrelated to the task at hand, leaving you with a thin vein of a plot to serve as a vehicle from one joke to the next.That’s not to say all the humour is bad, but a lot is random for the sake of being random. There's no narrative hooks for many of the jokes, they just exist for the sole purpose of delivering a punchline; experience it and move on. Funnily enough, the better jokes are ones that are actually tied into the game plot, making the others feel tacked on and unnecessary filler.There reigns the problem with the game; if you don't make an active effort to seek these jokes out, you'll miss most the content of the game (possibly without even meaning to) and probably finish the game within an hour. Even looking for them I finished at just shy of three hours, with the ending just kind of happening rather than being built up to. £9.99 for a game that feels like it was a student's spare time project seems rather hefty to me. At that price point, I'd rather just go watch a terrible blockbuster comedy, I'd probably enjoy it just as much.The game gets split up into levels, which are small but distinct zones. Actually, scrap small, most are tiny. They look nice enough, but they're mainly just straight lines with a few offshoots if you want to go indulge in the humour, and there is no other reason to go explore. There's not much else to say about the game because, well, there's not much else to the game. There's a bunch of mini-games, though Wedding Qake repeats, which was a ""ha ha, okay"" the first time, a revisit of the joke was needless. You can swat flies in a vase shop, I avoided smashing the vases and killed the flies, the only effect was I now had a fly swatter, that had no influence outside that game room. I went back and smashed the vases, no effect. Sadly the gameplay part of the game seems like an inconvenience just getting in the way of the game telling its next joke.Also, there's a Rita Repulsa gag (see power rangers circa 20 years ago). In a game released in 2014... Who's this aimed at again?True, games like Wario Ware get by without much of a narrative, but it also just takes you immediately from one gag to the next, not leaving you to seek it out.I do really like the aesthetics, the graphics, character design, the audio; it is actually a pleasant game to play from that point of view. It’s a shame it gets bogged down with trying to cram in as much 'humour' as possible at the expense of a more fleshed out main story arc.This is the game equivalent of going to a forum for the sole purpose of looking at a random assortment of animated gifs; just a series of out-of-context punchlines.I guess you might counter all this by saying it sounds like I bought a joke book and expected a novel, I guess that may be true to a certain extent. But I feel a more apt comparison is meeting a new group of people and having them telling all their in jokes and expecting you to laugh along with them without engaging in any actual conversation.If you're just looking for humour, then honestly, Jazzpunk will deliver that, you may not like everything (I'll put myself in that camp), but the chances are you'll find something to laugh at. Just beware that most the gameplay is in service of jokes... and going and looking for more jokes... oh and there's a frogger inspired mini game."

Jazzpunk is definately crazy plus a whole lot of random funny and surrealistic moments but then I finished it in exactly 103 minutes and thought...wait thats it? IM an explorer and I would say that out of those 103 minutes I was messing around and looking at everything. I thought that I would actually be busy playing this...but the puzzles are way to easy to figure out, there are no rewards and u cannot fail. I would not recommend buying it for the current price, buy it when it is on sale and have an hour of fun. OK Game...too short."

Jazzpunk absolutely nails humour in a way I've seen few games do before. It's like being in an Airplane movie, or The Naked Gun. Its dry delivery of absolutely absurd jokes is flawless - fantastic game."

The game itself is kind of short however i believe its a really good laugh and i reccomend it."
,Recommended,250260,9021406,"Posted: 8 February, 2014",all,Cpt. Noodles,"When I bought Jazzpunk I did not know what this game was about. After playing the game to completion I still don't. This is a game that even once it hints things are going to start to make sense, throws a curve ball of absurdity right at your face. The best way to describe this would be taking Bubsy 3D or Frog Fractions and mixing it with Thirty Flights of Loving or Gravity Bone. I enjoyed every minute of it, and I desperately want to jump back in and try to find the things I missed. Highly recommended if you are a fan of absurdist comedy and referencial humor."

Even though you'll get like maximum 3h of story playthrough you can still do side-quests and explore to gain achievements that are not hard to get. This game i can say that is unique in it's way and you should check it out. I give it 8.5/10.
