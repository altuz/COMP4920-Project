You can make Gamemodes, Servers with a simple theme, or just screw around with some friends of yours. And for the more than that thing; You can get Add-Ons with Blockland Glass or from the fourms.There is no story, but you can think of one by making a film, or doing a simple gamemode with Events and Bots.But I am kinda sad that this game didn't get this much attention, mostly because it is about 10 years old, and Nobody Else has played it since.But as a dead game, this is really fun to crack up and just enjoy.Gameplay: 7/10Gamemodes: 6.7/10Hilarity Factor: 8/10 (counting some servers and silly add-ons)EnjoyableFactor: 7/10Total Rating: 7.8/10 - It's fun, but everyone should try this for the faint of heart. -TheGoldenKai"

There once was a time I would have suggested this game over Roblox or Minecraft any day of the week, but these days Blockland is so stagnant and pointless with a developer that seems to have just given up and yells at anybody who argues with him that it's just not worth playing anymore. Ever since they removed maps, one of the most memorable parts of this game, all the game has had are 'bug fixes' and a few lighting updates. And that was.. years ago... The building aspect is still there, but it's almost not fun anymore when you can't make a diving board on the top of a house with 50 secret entrances"

However, I got it pretty recently (within the past 3 months) and I think it's pretty good. The building and overall gameplay took me a while to get used to it, but it plays fairly easily after that. The building system is a bit annoying, but you get used to it. The game modes are pretty good, but most of them are optimized for multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, the overall amount of servers and activity is decent. There are a lot of servers with varying game modes. The community seems OK from what I've seen on the forums, so no complaint there. However, I wish this game had Workshop support and more updates. Even though there is no Workshop, mods are pretty easy to download, but since Return to Blockland was discontinued they are a bit harder to get to work. Overall, I'd recommend it with a 7.5/10"

The game also has a lot of add-ons and modifications.However, the worst part of Blockland is the community. Just go tohttp://forum.blockland.usand see how horrible it is for youself. It's basically a group of users who argue a lot and spend more time on the forums than playing the actual game.Development is also deteriorating. Version 21, which was released in August 2012, was the last major update to the game. It was supposed to make it easier to add more features in the future, but a major update has not been released yet. Blockland also uses a 15-year-old game engine and this causes a lot of problems for add-on makers, such as glitchy vehicle physics and limitations on projectile speed.In conclusion: great gameplay and originality, but horrible community and slow development.EDIT: Yesterday, Heedicalking, a notable member of the Blockland community peacefully protested against the lack of the new features (which were promised exactly 2 years ago).

People who played the game without steam first can copy files across to fix it, but this is not an option open to those who don't.

I wouldn't reccomend picking up Blockland as the developer has essentially stopped working on the product.Minecraft is a much more adventure-based sandbox game with a lively modding community and is suitable for younger players (including children), but doesn't lose its appeal on adults.Space Engineers is (as of writing) an early access game for building your own space craft. Its building system feels like Blockland, but it's backed by a very cool physics engine. More suitable for older players and adults, especially if you're interested in realism and engineering based sandbox games.Blockland was a game I played for quite some time, but it hasn't aged well and has been usurped by newer and better things."

I am a very picky customer and I VERY rarely buy games but when I was told this game was like garrysmod meets legos I thought, okay maybe I'll give this a shot. What I was faced with was horrifying. I started up the game, went to create my character and was faced with the saddest excuse for a character creation system ever. It was so poorly designed and shallow that many would confuse that monstrosity for the work of ljn. This game is so poorly designed and it seems to be aimed towards children 6 to 10. It was a fair attempt but it just falls flat in my opinion. The video samples of the game were convincing so I thought maybe that the gameplay could be redeeming. After a painstakingly long loading screen, I was faced with terrible gameplay, no voice chat options and a painful amount of little kids. Among this little kids were ""Pizza Man"", ""Buttman"", and ""Awesome Guy"". This game has made me question everything I once held as holy. Please, NEVER buy this horrible, horrible game because all that awaits you is immediate disappointment. After I finish this review I am instantly deleting this garbage. It isn't worth the 50 MB it takes up. If anyone needs me I'll be weeping over the loss of my $10. I would buy this MAYBE for $2 but I would have to be in a REALLY bad way to resort to this game. Stick to flash games over this. They are free, you won't get burned, and you won't have the feeling of looming stupidity that I am currently experiencing.

It's like playing with legos, on the computer, and you don't have to buy the said legos. This game is what I have played a lot, just like another game I've played a lot. If you love legos, and are too lazy to get the money to buy real legos, then this game is for you. And one of the awesome things is that you can host your own server if you wanted, and addons are really easy to install. I recommend this game to people who have someform of creativity and loves legos. Just becarful when exploring the server list, there are some strange servers out there... not saying all of the servers are bad, just some of those servers could cause you to lose your sanity being there. I happen to host a server, though I don't get very many players thanks to certaint people who shan't be named for reasons that I will not tell you about. Though there can be some downsides to this game, it tends to cause weaker computers to crash, which is annoying since I have a horrable computer, but if you know what you're doing, and keep the addon count small, you'll be fine with hosting a server, and don't be afraid to ban people, they break the rules on your server, so it gives you the full right to ban them. And there are other people who complan about how bad the server is, and here's a little tip when dealing with them, simply tell them this ""My server, my rules. If you got a problem with this, then get off of my server."" and then ban them if they do not stop, and if you don't want them returning day after day, calling you some very rude, and stupid, names, then perma ban them, like I said, it's your server, you decide how it works, if people don't like it, then they don't like it. You can't change that. And be sure to be a very kind person so people like you, if you do that, more and more people will show up on your server. These are my words of wisdom for hosting a server, I'd share my wisdom on how to not be banned on other servers within five seconds, but I do not have time for that today. Good luck, my good people, you're going to need it. Also, check out my some of my guides for Blockland, I only have one at the moment, but feel free to check them out!"

,Recommended,250340,11410923,"Posted: 25 July, 2014",all,Atratzu,"-Quick Review-This game is basically Garry’s Mod but with Lego’s. I’ve never played Garry’s Mod, but the concept is basically the same. I had minecraft expectations, but I purchased the game on sale so I can’t really complain one way or another.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:NAGame Play:The game has controls very similar to Garry’s Mod. I don’t know if you adjust things you’re placing with the Number Keys on Garry’s Mod, but I assume that they’re very closely related.Achievements:Nothing to write home about, regarding the achievements. Personally “hidden” and “no description text” achievements really are annoying for me because you can simply look them up online. So there’s no real point in hiding the goal from us.Price:The price for Blockland is  $9.99 That’s way to high of a price for how much entertainment I’ll get out of it. This isn’t one of those games you can jump right in and start playing with. There is a learning curve to understand how the tools work and what you’re doing.If you’re into games like that you’ll enjoy this game, but there are other RPG’s that I would like to play instead of learning how to play Blockland at this current date.Conclusion:I’m on the fence regarding this game. Most people probably won’t put much time into the game. I intend to sometime come back to the game and see what kind of stuff I can build, but like I said, it requires a learning curve… and I suspect a work flow as well.Do not expect this game to control like minecraft, it controls like Gary’s Mod, or a “First person 3D program”."

Blockland is a very interesting blocky sandbox game with many things you are able to do in it. And I liked it. Emphasis on ""liked."" While it had a bit of popularity back in the older days, nowadays it feels somewhat... dead. I do remember playing on various sandbox servers, messing around with friends, building simple stuff (because I honestly kind of sucked). It was fun! It really was. But then friends stopped playing it, lost contact with said friends (because I didn't have them added to anything), and well... sort of found other things that were better.Compared to Roblox, which is sort of designed for a different, and possibly younger player base, I find it a bit more mature and well rounded. Which is probably why I enjoyed it more.It's a cool game, I assure you. It has lots of possibilites with mods and friends. Heck, now that it is on Steam you can play easily with friends. And the art style is awesome because it reminds me of LEGOs. But, again, I've lost interest due to the current path it is taking.

There's addons (oh boy, you saw this one coming didn't you.). You can grab new addons from the Blockland Forms or RTB. Just look it up on google m8. And slap on those addons to the Blockland addon folder. Now you got more blocks! ......what's that? Weapons? Vehicles? Oh so this is like Garry's mod. Lovely! Yes, there are weapons and tools for you to build or fight in custom mini games. Vehicles for you to race against your friends, so much more to play with! Hmm, if this is like Garry's mod...is there game modes? Yes, yes there is. From Speedkart to Xmas to Tutorials to anything really, you can download more on the forms and RTB.

It's a lot about creating minigames, as well as playing them. Almost all minigames need a map, you'll have to build one or find one to use. Anything creative, you'll have to find out how to implement. There's a rudimentary cause-and-effect event system which can do basic logic and counting on its own. With an addon, you can create and manipulate variables for bricks and players for more complicated logic. If you wish, there are basic AI bots that can be controlled via events and made to do tasks, such as moving, looking around, and shooting. Depending on how they're set up, they can ignore outside stimuli or be set to react to players entering a radius or their field of vision, or to always seek out and attack players. Thus, you can create PvE gamemodes, where hordes of zombies or enemy soldiers attack and players must defend themselves.If you're not willing to create things, however, there's usually something running; Prison Escape, a game more like an actual prison than Jailbreak, plenty of basic TDMs, capture-point maps, and CTF minigames, and racing games. There are also murder-mystery games (some better than others, try Despair Syndrome if you can), games where you build to survive natural disasters, and games where you build fortresses and fight.However, while there's usually SOMETHING running, not everything is always up. There are plenty of opportunities to host servers.If any of this seems daunting, don't worry. Setting up a minigame is as simple as pressing ""Minigames"" and ""Create"", then punching a few mostly self-explanatory settings if you'd like and hitting ""Create"" again. Events are simple and generally do what they say on the tin. ""onActivate, self, door, toggle"" toggles the door brick when you activate it by clicking on it. ""onPlayerTouch, player, addHealth, 1"" heals the player while they stand on the brick. There's a large number of addons to add to the eventing system and add new items, and if you'll bother to learn TorqueScript, you can add to it relatively easily.Maybe you've heard of the toxic community. Just don't reply to anyone in the NC, the TP, or autism(tm) clans if you go on the forums, and if you don't, you'll have no issue. The toxic people rarely are seen ingame outside their private servers and typically are focused on playing the game.The more people buy the game and stick around in the community, the better; if enough people show up, not enough people will know ""the rules"" and new unspoken rules will come about, theoretically better ones.It's a good buy. I have to say it, it's a good buy.BUT WAIT! Don't buy it here! Whatever you do, do NOT buy it on Steam! Steam's DRM makes it impossible to host an authenticated, dedicated server and an authenticated client on two machines! It's the same price on Amazon and Blockland.US, and you can redeem it on Steam! The end result is still the game on Steam, but also a key that can be used to host a dedicated server without authenticating through Steam!Hosting a non-dedicated server (one run through the same process as the client, meaning if you quit the server shuts down) is possible, as is running two processes to run a dedicated server and a client on the same computer (Steam only cares if you run it on two machines.)I must be honest here. This game is dying. It's been shown that a third-party master server can be used for authentication, meaning if the official support is shut down, you'll likely be able to authenticate your client and host LAN games, or even perhaps with a small community of people who really want to hang on. The developer has shown no interest in shutting down the master server nor the forums, and he even makes security patches when needed.However, we're losing players. When I first started playing, there were probably about 100 servers up at any given time. Now there's about 50, a year or two later. Help us host more servers with more players. It is not a support issue. The game works fine and all necessary services are running. We simply need players."

Its alot more than that.This game opens alot of opportunites. You go on, click the join game button and see a list of at least 20 servers. Theres always plently of servers open. Prision Escape, Fort Wars, FreeBuild, CTF, Diesease, Murder Mystrey, Bot Wars, Role-play severs, Speedkart and Deathrace are all good examples. Some are modded, some arent. Another good part of the game is the mods are automatically downloaded.Edited in for popular demand: Minigames and eventing are amazing. Start up a mini game and make it the way you want. Turn the mini game to a capture the flag ot even a City RPG.Eventing is even better. Event a brick so when you click on it, it plays a song or even tells you something. Make hidden rooms with disappering bricks, Make your bots look like you, Make traps so people fly into the air and so much more that i cant remember.Sadly, on mac, It is a bit glitchy. You cant see any faces, when you start up the game it asks you to setup your settings and your player always resets.Singleplayer is mostly good for nothing, unless you have some fun mods or you just want to mess around with bots or something.It is still the funnest game ive ever played in history of games ive played. EDIT: e.g. ive played 200 hours of it. (and none of my other games have come close to that.)Mods are hard to get, there are some websites that have archives of the epic website, RTB. (that is closed)In all its such a fun game, but there are a few sad reasons of not to get it. I'd reccomend it to people that like: sandbox, building, fps, loling, role-playing, zombies and tf2 like games!!"

It might not be because of steam nor version 21, but this game was my teenagehood and I still play it. This game would be my all time, top 5 favorite games of all time because this game is not a competetive game if you do not want it to be. You choose whatever you want to do, whenever you want, experiencing it with friends online or just play on your own time to yourself. You can add many interesting toold, features, decals, and more to spice up your games' features. You can add these weapons and tools made by your fellow community from the forums or ingame with the rtb client.

So BL is a building game first made in 2004 in the V0002 state, the retail version was then released in 2007 with the latest version being V21. Have you've ever played with LEGO's as a kid or built something with them? Did you ever have fun with them? If yes, then Blockland is the game for you. The game allows you to build with a virtually unlimted amount of bricks (There's a 256,000 brick limt,but you can set your own limt on your own server). It also even features an in-game eventing system that allows you to do cool stuff with your bricks like make a door that open and closes or a light switch. The modding community is also pretty good with a good number of brick packs, vehicles, colorsets, music, and etc. The community itself isn't the best, but there really isn't a perfect community out there anyway. You may meet some bad players here and there,but if you stay away from the bad side of the community you'll be fine. The graphics are very blocky and legolike giving a very nice look especially for a old 2003 engine.There are shaders in the game,but they look very jaggy and bad and they're also very poorly optimized at it too.If you want to there are modifications that can help you make the shadows look smoother,but you'll need a great PC to get it done. I would really recomend this game to anybody if you like building games and don't worry you'll really get your money's worth, I've spent at least about 400hrs (With my old blid and steam blid combined) on the game and haven't stopped yet.Note: When you first get the game I would highly recommend getting RTB."

While Roblox is now a slot machine, it still maintains to update itself in such a fashion. Its now more sleek and modern that Blockland here, and that normally wouldn't be a problem, but the problem is that this the year of 2014.I'm not saying that you can't release games like Shovel Knight, but from playing Blockland in 2008, to actually buying it on Steam in 2014, not a single damn thing has hardly been changed/updated. The only major updates have actually removed cult hit maps due to ""incompatibilities"". Guys, thats the equlivent of Garry completly removing construct from GMod... but again, it still wouldn't matter. Why? The whole reason why Blockland has failed: Community.You see, if Garry decided to remove famous content, the COMMUNITY would be like ""Time to fire up some Source SDK"" in  Blockland? Nope.To site an excellent review from DarkByte97;""The community for this game is virtually nonexistant (unless you're dying to be in a commuinty full of autocratic ♥♥♥♥♥). I have not seen a gaming community full of more hostile and irrational people in my life. This is why all of our servers have nothing good.""Amen brother. Server after server, you'll meet some very arrogent people within the ""community"". Want to find some advice on subject matters that genuinely need answering? ""Lol Roblox feg go frack urself lawl go suck Builderman's stud loL!!11!"" The community sites Roblox as a terrible game, yet does nothing for their beloved game to actually help stand out against a superior platform for block building.What about Gameplay? Surely thats half-way decent...Building is... absolutley awful. Where you have a entire keyboard and mouse to use to construct your ""uber amazing"" projects, you use a numpad... its a awkard and seemingly unnecessary game mechanic to learn. Why can't I just simply right click to place a block? No, you HAVE to use the numpad, and if you don't, then you're too stupid. Again, age has been an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ to this game, so clunky controls come with it.EDIT 1: You can rebind keys if you find the numpad off settingWhat about mods? Yeah, it supports them, and there are some good ones out there... on a site that shut down a couple of months ago. Yup. Awesome right? There are archives out there however, but still isn't as great as RTB.But hands down, the WORST part about Blockland is not the game itself, as old as it may be, but what surrounds it. The developer's complete ignorance and the communities lazy boy style of support, there's no water in Blocklands well, and its a damn shame becuase it has such amazing potential.I got lucky, I only bought this for a buck or two during the summer sale, but it was hardly worth that.If ""Badspot"" even decides to update Blockland with Steam Workshop, (he said he would, but that was a long time ago) maybe we'll see some cool stuff, and that the Steam community will do what the ocean did to Atlantis, and layer over the arrogent Blocktards, and shove some fire into Blockland's cold, dead heart."

Still, it feels werid to me atleast.) Second, the graphics don't look... all that great (even if you have the shaders on MAX.)Overall, this is a really fun sandbox game and I highly recommend it. Even though some of the controls are a bit akward and the graphics aren't that good. It's still a good game. And if you have any friends on here, it's a great mutliplayer experince.

There are different game modes. Like treasure hunting, Pvp, Jumping platform and some others. The game is not offering alot.It is a weaker version of Minecraft. Even more childy.Other things.Only purchase with a discount.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10"

Either too low, or so loud that it gets completely distorted.- There is no music.- Most of the time, the game is silent. When it is not silent, there is some explosion or some loud sound.- The graphics don't look good. Specifically, the lighting effects and the particles look awful.- Building blocks is not as fun because it requires both clicking and using the keyboard numpad. Minecraft got it right, putting blocks in Minecraft is fun and intuitive. Putting blocks in Blockland is not.- The physics engine is weird and bad. I started up a new single-player kart racing game, drove for a few seconds, and accidentally hit a wall. The next second I was flying across the map.- Multiplayer kart racing is not fun. At one moment I'm driving, at the next moment I'm flying across the map because someone hit me.- Due to poor car handling, I have not managed to finish any kart racing. Neither in single-player, nor in multiplayer.- I don't know if it is triple-buffering or something else, but I feel there is some input lag in the game.- It has an achievement called ""Gay Pirate"". I guess the author thought it would have been funny, but it is not. In fact, it is completely out-of-place, and some people might view it as offensive.After 1 hour of gameplay, I'm wondering why I bought this game. Well, it was because it cost me 2 dollars. But now I wonder if I will ever play it again.Then I come back to Steam Community and look at the developer response to some reviews. I'm really starting to regret buying this game.Note: Using keyboard to place blocks can be very handy sometimes. However, requiring it all the time is not practical, as it means I need to move my hand away from WASD or from the mouse. Not fun.Note 2: At least the game has a borderless mode (besides the windowed mode and fullscreen mode).Note 3: The entire game has less than 100MB when installed.Bottom line: I had more fun exploring worlds of Second Life, playing the single-player survival mode of Minecraft, and building levels in Cube Engine and Sauerbraten."

It's straight smack danm in the middle.It seems like parts of the game battle each other. The concept, artstyle, and basic building aspect fight the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ comminuty, forums, and the devs...Let's start with the happy stuff.Brick building! so much you can build. That part is fun. You could make a arena and fight in it, build yourself a house, and then a nebirhood, and then a city. Roleplay in it, fight in it. Add addons to make this even better. Build an airport, a military base, a cottage. Anything.Then, event it. Script it to make an awesome game of pong, working annoucements, working bombs, automated guns, automated bots, and entire games made out of some bricks and events.The eventing and building was fun. It was a great idea.And for the final good thing, There are still decent servers. Only a few, but some.Now for the negatives... now, you are about to see my atttuide about this game deeply change for this part.The comminuty. Is a apitmal ♥♥♥♥♥. It's like every 6 year old from elementary school, who says ""U mad bro"" and teases, and bullys, It's the biggest cluster♥♥♥♥. The forums are♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't go on them. There is an entire section of the forums to writing negative threads about people, there servers, or your friends on BL. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. There's only 1 out of 4 people who are decent human beings playing a video game. Oh, and notice there's no age limit when you click on this in the store? There should be. The amount of sexual, and the heaping amount of swears on this game are unbelivable even for a vulgar person who does it a lot. It's way over the borderline for that type of person. Sure, there's a censoring system. Yeah, but it's like roblox and it can be bypassed by a 3 year old. &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; Will be taken out. ""Sh!t"", ""Sh*t"", and a lot more will not. A female or male's parts? Nope. ""Jackass""? Nope.Yep. The comminuty is so bad IHAD TOwrite that much.Oh, and the latest update, V.22 Removed terrain and all that nice stuff, and in turn added some shaders or something boring like that.The devs, are completly still around, but only on the forums and for accasonial bug fixes, (But that doesn't mean a million explotive bugs are still around forever) Have never updated the game in a while.And, the final con.*Dramatic Drumroll*Blockland 2. Is a thing.Meaning this same cluster♥♥♥♥, will repeat. Same brick building, same comminuty. It's going to happen. The maps and terrain will return, woohoo, but, probally:3 4th of your addons? Not compatible.Some of your amazing brick saves? Not transfering over.Even though you own the first game? Go give the dev some more money.And one new feature, and probally the only one beside better GUI'S maybe?Physics... You're building a house and it tumbles over because some jackass pushed it.Just wonderful..Overview: I can and can't reccomend this, it just depends on you're view.

This game is really nostalgic to me and it's actually quite a nice game, though not very many people play it anymore, there are still quite a few active servers and a variety of gamemodes for everyone to play. With many things, you can set events and what not. For example, if I wanted to make a door so I could only open it with a button, I could simply just set it ""On activate, named brick, door, toggle."" Yeah, making event stuff is VERY simple and easy. Let me say, this game has a horror mod called ""Renderman"" and it is ♥♥♥♥ing scary. Earlier versions of the renderman mod used a very loud high-pitched whine when he either got you or looked at him. Today, the mod uses a low-pitched drone that slowly gets louder as well as glitch noises. This game is really fun to play.Just a tip: Never play any gamemodes that go by the name of ""Boss battles""According to everyone who plays it, everything depends on ""tactics"" and ""playstyle"" oh, and  you die in one hit to everything. Zero fun unless you find being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off fun."

I could have been playing a vastly superior game. Now that I think about it, I should not call this a game. It's more of a work of art. Eric ""Badspot"" Hartman, the modern day Pablo Picasso and creator of this masterpiece obviously knows how to create new, fresh, original content, and not take the ideas of others and put them into a subpar game, in a genre controlled by a single giant game. Minecraft, on the other hand, attempts to rip off a game such as this, to a lesser quality. Does minecraft have a destruction engine? Nope, but this mona lisa of games does. Does minecraft have a working multiplayer? Hardly, but the sistine chapel of sandbox building games, Blockland, sure does. The only thing I can say in conclusion is that to all minecraft players looking for a better experience, look no further then Blockland."

,Recommended,250340,10317013,"Posted: 1 June, 2014",all,Hausu,"Where do I even begin with this game. First off ive been playing this game for about 7 years now and every playthrough ive had of it was exellent. There is alot of variety when it comes to builds. There is the obvious Light/Dark or Grey option for the game but there is also Force user builds, Ranged builds, Pure combat focused guardian, etc. I find the combat to be enjoyable (In my opinion) since its tactical and you can really plan attacks and things of that sort. Take DA:0 for example. Its pretty much the same system. You can start with 3 beginning classes: Guardian (Combat focused), Sentinel (Better skill progression), and Consular (Force powers). You then later in the game get different set of prestige classes depending on your allignment. Now, lets get to the writing of the game. This game has one of the best stories I have ever seen. You'll see once you play it for yourself. The reason I prefer this game slightly over the first is just because I prefer the darker, philosophical, grey aspects of the atmosphere and story a bit better (Kotor 1 is also one of my favorite games). Anyways, this game presents the idea that Dark is not necessarily evil and Light isnt nessesary good and you really get to see the Flaws of both sides. For example, you play as the Jedi Exile, who was exiled from the Jedi order for rusing to war to protect innocents. The Jedi were lazy and waited to ""evaluate the threat"". The dialouge and voice acting in this game is absolutely fantastic (Especially Kreia). For this game, you dont even need to be a fan of Star Wars. A non Star Wars fan would look at this game and just play an RPG. However a Star Wars fan would look at this and play an amazing Star Wars RPG. The reason for this is because the game is set in an era wayyy before the Movies. One flaw however, would be the cut content presented this game. Obsidian (The developers) were rushed to release this game by lucasarts, resulting in them needing to cut out content for the game. Luckily, a group of community modders managed to get into the games files and restore alot of the content that was cut. You can find the mod on the steam workshop. Anyways, hurry up and buy the game! You wont be dissapointed."

It was pretty much the only game I owned on Steam back then that would run for me! Lets review it.Gameplay:Blockland has gave me 50 hours (and counting) of fun gameplay, in what seemed like so little time I had alreay indulged myself into the many servers that the game has (my favourite being the PvP) until at one point I decided, ""Why should I keep playing OTHER peoples servers when I can make my own?"" not only does this statement show that servers are hosted for free but it also shows that the community made me feel welcome so much I wanted to let them into MY places. So off I went! My natural instinct was to start some sort of RP server as I knew this would only mean basic building so I could slowly get to grips with the games controls and its compelling and complex ""Event"" system that allows players to code/link things up to other things that does things? As you see I haven't delved into that but I know you probably will!Graphics:Blockland has a very unique art style within the character and models area, essentially creating a virtual Lego experience! The option for shaders* is there and the latest patches automatically enables them if your graphics card supports it! Overall nice, rich textures and unique model style never seen before.Controls:Your basic Blockland controls consist of the regular WASD keys for movement and spacebar for jumping. It's all fair and well saying this but there IS a learning curve to this game (not a curve that will take ages to learn, just some basic memorising). The key curve to this game is the building mechanics, the building has its own keybinds! Hurray! Fortunately there isn't MILLIONS of keys that make the brick move 1cm of a brick however it does consist of the numpad section. For some people the thought of this could be quite daunting however I assure you that you will learn. Jetpack as well so thats awesome, right?Conclusion:As this review has got quite long I believe it may be time to wrap this up. So overall I'm going to rate this game 9.8/10! This is by far one of the most precise ratings yet for me however the 0.2 is just for the unfortunate loss of playerbase now - it appears to be steadily decreasing... Overall awesome game. Must have for any person who is a fond fan of Minecraft and/or other sandbox based games.I hope you enjoyed my review (if you read it that is)!*For those of you who don't know, shaders basically add shadows to the game and other visual effects that overall make the graphics look MUCH nicer."

,Not Recommended,250340,11717924,"Posted: 15 August, 2014",all,Wazat1,"I tried this out for a while and didn't enjoy it.  The controls for placing and orienting blocks are very clumsy, and to build anything above chest height you typically need to use the awkward jetpack.  It's very difficult to orient and snap things in place when you're trying to fly with the jetpack or balance on a wall while placing lego blocks, and I grew to hate the process.    Frankly, it's difficult and awkward even while standing still on ground level, and very time-consuming.  It's especially frustrating that you're limited to working with a single block at a time -- you can't grab a group of blocks and move them like you could with real blocks, and the tedium of aligning and placing each block with the really unreliable controls just sucked.After making a small room-sized building, I realized just how limited the blocks really are.  There's not a lot of interesting pieces, and it takes forever to work with even the pieces you're given to make anything.  Making even basic stuff takes an unreasonably long time because of the unreliable alignment and orientation (requiring very specific adjustments to camera angle with each block placed).  If you want to spend time creatively crafting a world, I recommend Minecraft instead as it's a lot more streamlined and there are a lot more block types and effects.  If you love legos, go buy some real ones, because this clumsy game just doesn't have the satisfying feeling of playing with legos in real life, and the process is so awkward and slow it will take you an unreasonably long time to do anything.The cart racing was mildly interesting for a round or two, but lag was crippling and the game became rapidly un-fun and un-playable, even on a low-lag server.  Once you fall into one of the many instant-death traps or pits, you have to sit and wait for the round to end (and lag usually makes sure you die sooner than later, but even without lag, the controls are terrible).  Also, you can't really do much with your cart -- building cool custom stuff on wheels just isn't available, and you apparently only get to select from pre-designed carts each round.  You appear to be able to make custom levels, and a few people have gone to the trouble, but the cart game itself is so clunky that the environments don't add much.  And most of the environments I saw were pretty boring and undetailed, which isn't surprising given the work it takes to do basic stuff.Frankly, I have trouble taking the preview images on the store page seriously.  To do that in minecraft would take a few hours; to do it in blockland would take a few weeks.  It makes me wonder if the people making those images used external tools to build the worlds, instead of the clunky in-game process.Last of all... the community is unpleasant.  There were a few nice people, but many people on multiplayer servers devote every second of their day to harassing other players, and this appeared to be actively encouraged.  They picked the most spammy, disruptive weapons and a victim and fired at him nonstop.  The super-spammer rocket launcher didn't destroy what I was trying to build, but it made progressing further impossible because my screen shook like crazy and the effects blinded me.  I felt that I was wasting my time playing on a server where someone can just hop on and start harassing me without reason, and it's not fun playing alone.  It takes too long to build anything, and you walk away feeling like the time you spent was wasted.  There are a lot of builder games out there, including early access stuff that's much more advanced than this (e.g. Space Engineers & Minecraft).Give this one a pass.  I wasted time trying it, I wasted friends' time trying it.  We all walked away disappointed and feeling cheated.  Ignore the pretty advertisement pictures; even if you had the patience to someday craft that with the bad controls and obnoxious griefers, you won't walk away satisfied or having enjoyed the process.  Game is not as advertised."

Every update that came out slowly made this game worse and worse.

One of the best-selling, independently developed and published video games, Blockland's official release was in November 2011 following a lengthy beta test phase that attracted millions of players. Players can create items and buildings from scratch using materials they harvest from the world around them. There is no story, but players will encounter aggressive monsters they can fight using swords and bows. Graphics are extremely blocky, and there is no blood or gore, but the creatures can be a bit scary when they over sexually moan or appear seemingly out of nowhere to molest the players winky. Parents should note that this game has a thriving online community hosted by private, non-moderated servers. This means players could encounter offensive content in the form of profane text messages and suggestively shaped player-created structures, although players don't have to engage in online activity to enjoy the game.

Infinite possibilities.The building machanic is pretty confusing, but it's very satisfying, for some odd reason.

Turcotte -*Update* (Again)( I origanaly said this was a ""Minecraft Ripoff"" This is a message to those who replied in a negative way)I really find some people on Steam are takeing my Review the wrong way. So what if my opinion isn't the same as yours? I'm not going to become a Conformist just because everyone else thinks it's a master peice. Again. This game i'd recommend to 6 or 7 year old. Because it's like a Lego game. Actually when i put it that way. It's a Lego ""Ripoff""I decided to make a List of Pros and ConsPROS: The Few advantages of playing Minecraft, Blockland and others like it is it prepares you for life.  The obvious one is carpentry, building houses, underground lairs, whatever. You eventually develop skills that could be useful.  Another note is it's life itself. You chat with people online. You don't trust the nearby nood who you just met with a one of your guns, will you? No, obviously not. Players will develop trust issues with other players online. Just like in the real world. The players will develop friendships as well, because the players avatars are in form of human. It's life.CONS: It's just like the leading competitor and very popular game ""Minecraft"" or/and basically copying the whole concept from an all time popular toy game ""Lego"" So remember when you play this game. They copied/Stole the idea from someone else. Players could be nasty with one another online. Throwing violent words at each other, It's supposed to be a child's game! No violence. (Swear words) It's because of these game were children develop ""Bad attitudes"" and/or ""Bad languages ""Because of the Adults/Teenagers who play these games and get angry.  When people wonder on ""why children these days are so mean,"" Think about this game!I keep my point stable I don't recommened this Game!!!!"

If things have changed then the devs deserve a big round of applause for moving so far forward. If everything is the same then I really wonder what the heck I was thinking on my original review. That said here are my revised opinions.An excellent tutorial gets you up and going in no time. An option has been added to choose whether you have a laptop or not so now controls are less confusing. Building is still a little slower going than many other block based games but it is very precise, so you don't waste time placing bricks where you do not want them. I'm getting faster at placement all the time now so I guess it is just a matter of getting used to them. The meat and potatoes of the game are the many different game modes. There is a bit of everything here: Racing, pirates, a treasure hunt and even just plain old building. I think i'm going to get some more of my friends to try this one out: I'm guessing this is a gas with some buddies around to torment.Game performance is quite good and everything runs really smooth. I love the shading and just Lego-y look to it all. Blockland sets out to do it's own thing and I am really enjoying it. Don't expect it to be Minecraft: It has blocks, you can build stuff and that is all they have in common. This is a good thing. Kick back and enjoy the mayhem. From now on Blockland will stay on that limited real estate on my Macbook Air's  hard drive. I'm happy to turn that thumb around to the up position for this one!"

The menu could do with some work and on the mac version some times you cant place briks and have to reload the lvl befor it works again. But that could just be my system. Another issue is that things like your character's name and designe doesnt save and the tutorial lvl when asks you to simply place a brick just clams that the block limit is reached.Multiplayer is really fun but not that many people have put up any custome maps. Which is a shame as there is so much you could do with this!All in all a good game but could do with some work on the mac version. If you can see past the few issues on mac then go for it!

The charm has been lost, as the community has been exhausted and has no motivation to make any good servers. Any good servers have been lost, due to people just no longer wanting to play the game and not caring anymore. This causes random non dedicated servers to rise to the top of the server list because no one has anything else to play. Now, maybe this would be fine, but these servers were not intended to be of amazing quality, but just to play with a few friends.And guess why? No big new updates. It's a chain reaction from famous and well respected people leaving due to pure boredom.Now, if Badspot had said he would no longer update the game, I, and maybe others, would've been okay with it. But nope, for two years he made no worthwhile updates and everyone asked him why. However, when people did, he would lose his mind and swear and yell at people who dared to ask. And than one day he just said he was no longer motivated and did not want to satisfy ""shrieking children."" Well, if you updated the game in the mean time, maybe they would not have been ""shrieking"" as you say.Even if they maturely gave their opinions, he would ban them. He just did not care.

The building is slower but more detailed than other games for smaller constructions, but for larger ones with lower detail it is very fast compared to other games. The servers are amazing, and the mods are more than awesome. There are unique servers like grapple-knife tdm, where 4 teams compete on floating platforms with grappling hooks that swing around like spiderman and knives, as well as really cool gunfight servers with large city maps with interiors, there are fnaf servers, mario esque platforming servers, racing servers, and you can start your own online server without port forwarding! Making addons is super easy because it uses torquescript, and the only hurdle is .dst models, and the low-poly limitations.  Playing with friends is a blast and the wrench events are amazing, they can be used like scripting in a certain other game what so happens to be free, The community is lively and interesting, however you end up with one of two things: 80% of the time everyone is treated equally well, 20% of the time it's ♥♥♥♥♥ where everyone is treated equally badly, but handy filters and turning off the chat are there for those times.The building is the most precise I've ever played, even when compared to lego worlds, minecraft and roblox's non-studio variant. making servers that are effectively games is fun, and you get even more freedom than roblox studio if you know what to do with torquescript.9.5/10"

It seems that most people see the game and buy it because they think it will be like minecraft. When in reality to me it feels like a roblox, but more compressed. No doubt blockland is a great game, but it is not a game you can pick up and start making epic things in a day. Like any game blockland has to be learned, you have to know what menus are which, and you have to know where things are. But blockland to me feels a little bit more complicated. So going back to making epic things in a day, might take maybe a couple of weeks if you really want to. Then you will get the hang of it. Overall blockland has great servers, minigames, and many things you could do. If you want to spend your money on something that you will play every once in a while and love it then this game is for you.-7.5/10 SnowyParker"

Some points to know if you want this game:1. This game is old. And I mean really old – it started back around '02. It's changed tremendously since then, but it's no longer receiving updates. This means that the community os slowly dying.2. This game doesn't run too well on iMacs. You can play it fine, without any lag, as long as all the settings are turned down, which hinders the already-not-so-great graphics.3. The community isn't too great. Eventually, the game is gonna die, which is a sad thought, but it will last for some years yet.Now, that being said, I love this game. It's like being turned into a Lego Man and thrown into a pile of bricks. In fact, that's the whole premise of the game! You can build anything you want – and trust me, the community has done some awesome things – and it's not too difficult to get your head around.Not only that, but the addon (a form of mod that is official) library for this game is MASSIVE!Hop on over tohttp://swololol.com/rtbfor the best ones, and they're easy to install. This makes an already huge game massive. The many servers (some of the best being Boss Battles and Tez's Prison Escape) have taken advantage of these addons to make some very enjoyable experiences.I would recommend this game to anyone who loves being creative. You'll spend countless hours on this game, even though the developer has moved on.That's the 'official' sounding review.My personal view?It makes me feel like I'm a Lego Man, and I can make castles, battle arenas, ships, cities - anything.I love this game with all my heart - I'll not stop playing it for some time.One little warning:The community isn't too great. Be careful where you go. :)Have fun, and don't stop building."

I started playing this game many years ago like 2008 oder 2007 I dont really remember with a friend. We both seriously had a fun time installing Add Ons for this game and it was a fun time building all the things we´ve wanted. I still remember those old maps like Bedroom, Kitchen and Space ( I think it was Space ) and I really miss them in this newest version of this game so PLEASE ADD THEM SOMEHOW. I still remember this secret place in the Bedroom which I found with my friend, most of the Vintage players will understand. This GAME IS FREAKING GREAT. Im still a lil bit dissapointed that the maps got removed, oh man. Still Im really happy with it. Thanks to the guy who ever made this game, you´ve changed my Childhood into the good."

Some people may think it's a Roblox or a Minecraft clone, but it really shouldn't matter if somebody thinks that. I once played the demo a while ago when it was usually bought on the original website. I found it okay. I went through the tutorial, then went to some levels like a bedroom, kitchen, and a few others. After playing it for a while, I kind of ditched the game and went on to do other stuff. Even now, I always felt like I shouldn't play it because of the stuff, and never really touched it---until now.I never knew this game was on Steam because I never searched for it on the store. When I was looking through the winter sale and looked at games that were under $10. I was searching through it when I noticed the game. I felt like this was odd it was on Steam. So later on, I bought the game and also bought Surgeon Simulator 2013. The next day I played the game. I was getting back to how the game worked. I changed my character, then made a server without even knowing how it works. I was trying to remember the controls, until later on I thought that I should go back to the tutorial so I can get used to the game again. The tutorial was different, I could tell because it includes you building a staircase and other stuff. After finishing the tutorial, I went on to some gamemodes like the kart one and the one where you demolish a map that is chosen. This was really what I did during the time I played the game for an hour. I then felt like I shouldn't have left the game because I would know about what is in the game during updates. I'm glad I got this game for about $7 during its sale. I hope to see some stuff later on in the future in Blockland. I really like it already."

It’s similar to Garry's Mod in that there are add-ons that you download. It has a Lego style building aspect that allows its community to build some pretty spectacular things. This game seems to have a very dedicated community bent on making it a fun experience for all playing. The game is actually much older than its 2013 Steam release. It hit its peak in 2008 from non-steam client downloads and built most of its fan base then. It is a lot of fun with friends and not much fun at all alone, so I don't recommend picking it up unless you have at least another person on board with you."

After playing for such a long time, I still am able to hop onto a server and get the feeling as if I'm playing it for the first time again.I see a lot of people bashing the community and I can't say they're not completely wrong. However, this game's community isn't entirley terrible. I see a lot of people comparing it to the roblox community. I am able to say that this game's community isn't nearly as bad as roblox's. I've met a lot of great people who definitley do not fit into this category. Therefore, in order to solve the community problem, just stick with the right crowd. Saying this game is bad because of the community is like saying your neighborhood is terrible because you have a handful of lousy neighbors, even when you could live in a place like Bel-Air.Another thing I see being criticized about the game is how it's ""changed"".

I don't know about you, but to me, 200 people is a very small amount for a multiplayer online game. Garry's mod will have 200 people on for a single GAMEMODE.Second of all, it's dull. Sure, I had fun with it for the first hour, but then I got sick of it. You CAN get addons, and you CAN use them, but here's the problem - there are no addons! As far as I know, this game used to be a blast until it came on Steam. This website where everybody posted their addons shut down, and everybody quit. The community is practically dead.I would just overall not recommend this game. If you are a person who likes building stuff and doing nothing with it, then this game is for you. Otherwise, I just suggest you save your money for something else.My Rating: 3/10"

For example, they made a complete remake of an old map called ""The Bedroom"" where the entire map is actually a save file included in the game and is made entire out of bricks instead of it being a fully pledged map. I don't get it, I thought the original bedroom was good enough, and speaking of maps, there use to be more. Nowadays the only free build map is... well... just a plain flat green map, similar to the Flatgrass map in Garry's Mod. Another thing that should be mentioned is that if you buy this game and you're expecting to find a good multiplayer server, you're gonna be dissapointed because not too many people play this anymore."

The main problem is with the forum, the community which keeps on acting like if they still have 13 years and it's game developers.This is the greatest example of a good game being ruined by the community:Abusive admins are everywhere and there's nothing you can do about it (of course);The forums are hell. Literally hell, where the game developers are angry to everyone who don't agree with everything they do, just look at these two screenshots: the pinnacle of the professionality:http://prntscr.com/2qsz4ohttp://i.imgur.com/33R5f6D.jpgPeople who join your servers are most of the time stupid kid-like people who just want to screw everything up (thus why the abusive admins are everywhere) and will most likely ignore every warning you give at them replying with insulting messages;V21 Killed this game, to me. Shaders are not that great, and the static map still works with the shaders (just look at the Static Map addon, if they were ""that bugged"" as Kompressor said it would've been awful using them, yet it's not);They closed the old RTB forum without even backing up the addons, which is a great loss, as 3/4 of the addons you'll see in game are from that site.Yet the game itself is quite good, the mod support lets you do stuff you wouldn't be able to do in many games without crashing too often.With the right addon setup you can make a zombie survival, or prison escape, or a minigame server, or even something where you bet on which NPC would win against another (like that Obsidian Conflict's map), or a classic CTF\TDM while being both a normal character or a Starcraft's hydralisk. You can pretty much make everything you would love in this game, and the greatest thing is that this game doesn't have a ""Builder club"" nor any other premium idiocracy, so everyone are the same, which is fantastic.But the community really, really sucks.This is a good game for a closed community. And avoid ""RP"" or ""Freebuild"" servers like the plague.In short: nice game, awful developer and community, buy something else. or even get ""Blockland classic mod RTB"", which is literally this game for free."

It may seam boring at first when you don't know how to play but once you hop online, thats when the fun starts.It was released along time ago, so if you don't find it that good, than at least its good for a old game. Building and socializing are my most favourite things about this game. You can even stop playing because you just want to chat. You can make the most amazing things or destroy the most amazing things.Hosting a server is no problem. You don't need to install anything unless you want mods. Just choose the gamemode and start playing! And there's always servers hosted from other people around the world online. So if you can't get someone to join your server, join someone else's!The title screen looks quite boring but you know what they say, don't judge a book by it's cover! You can also save your worlds and troll other people by trapping them in jails and other stuff like that.They just need to add a some more blocks but theres lots of cool things like there's vehicles and you can color blocks with a spray paint. You can also configure blocks to make them do things. But that can get complicated if you don't know what to do.So what are you waiting for? Go pay for it and have fun!- 9/10"

76561198291390012,Recommended,250340,31614308,Posted: 7 May,all,BlackRoseWyvern,"Blockland may not be as 'good' as it once was according to its long time fans, but nevertheless I enjoyed revisiting this after about a two year hiatus.Blockland, at face value seems like it could pass as a Lego game, however Blockland allows people to do more than just build like you would in Lego - people can meet up online and enjoy either a fast paced Team Deathmatch, a roleplay, a freebuilding session, battling against a boss, kart racing, the list goes on! Of course, that is all thanks to the people running all of these online servers everyday - some are even dedicated (meaning they never go down, even if the host leaves - but it stops when the host decides to close the program which allows this.)To make all these enjoyable servers happen, though, hosts take the time to learn how to script events. With events, you could make a single 1x1 block explode like a nuke, send you flying upwards, sideways, etc., and even kill your character instantly. You can even make a block dispense a weapon like a Rocket Launcher, a sword, or a Spear. On the subject of dispensable items, you may notice that your selection of items is a bit lackluster in the core game - sure, you have a gun.. dual guns.. a broom that pushes people away... basic tools... that's cool and all, but where's all the cool stuff? Where's the laser blasters and lightsabers and sniper rifles and TF2 based weapons?Well, that my friend, is where Add-Ons come in.Blockland has a massive Add-On community - in fact, there's a forum for Blockland with at least 3700+ posts / threads in it's Add-On section, and about 3500+ posts / threads in its Music section! To make things even better, getting add-ons into your copy of Blockland is incredibly easy - all you have to do is open the game's files, go into the Add Ons folder, and place your newly downloaded addons into there!I must say though, while I do really enjoy this game, there are several things that may hinder your experience online. First of all, while there are amazing coders and 3D modellers showing their stuff off in the Blockland Forums, the actual players are... well... there's a reason why earlier I said 'people' earlier and not 'kids'. Most of the actual players of Blockland are some of the most immature people on the Internet - people with atrocious names, people who are pure toxic, the list goes on. Granted, not everyone is like that on servers. Sometimes you can find people who can make a joke but are able to hold back any urge to be immature.Secondly, and this one is easy to notice - Blockland looks outdated graphics wise. Animations of player characters are smooth in the core game, but body parts look a bit rough around the edges - it could be argued that it's natural as this game is called Blockland where you control customizable Blockheads.Thirdly, and speaking of customizable Blockheads, the amount of things you can customise on your character is very limited - a small amount of colours to choose from, a limited amount of options on the hats you can wear, same for shoulderpads and things to wear on your back and only two types of feet and hands. More customisation options would have been better.All in all, I believe even though Blockland is definitely flawed and isn't really in it's golden years anymore, it's still a fun game to me nonetheless, and I will recommend it. If you have a kid who wants to play it, though, do everything you can to limit them only to Singleplayer before they go online."

(FNaF, labRP and Undertale for example)I'm giving this a thumbs up because it can still be fun with friends and I even met new ones.It also is a small part of my childhood.Buy this game on your own risk."

Other than that, it's not that good. I'll still continue to play it though. Maybe my opinion will change later on."
