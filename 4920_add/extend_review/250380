,Recommended,250380,7390308,"Posted: 14 October, 2013",all,Unravel,"Knock-Knock is a little rumination about what is more dire, demons from within or from the outside? In this game you must figure out all by yourself how to play it to revel in its entirety. There are general rules told imperceptibly but each one of them has sides it takes time and retries to grasp. Knock-Knock is frustrating, hard and irritating at times, but it remains captivatingly horrifying all through the end. Lend it your ears, pay attention and believe in what you see or decide not to — control the outcome with the help of your senses.With ingenious intended glitches like those from Anodyne, beautifully drawn visual style similar to Don't Starve's and cunning survival horror mechanics which really do improve the genre. Knock-Knock, despite not being the same game it was intended originally, is still a ""phenomenon"" which you absolutely should observe."

If you still don't understand what this game is about, well, join the club. However, half the fun is figuring it out.And it's really friggin creepy. I know the art style look like something out of a Tim Burton film, but this game scares the crap out of me and stays with me long after I play. That's why this game gets my recommendation."

Players never know when they open the inexplicably doors locked doors of the home whether or not there will be some ghoul or apparition waiting on the other side. Another great aspect of this game is that as the game progresses, the situation feels progressively more and more desperate. By the later levels, one begins almost to beg for the time to elapse before day break, especially in those situations where you are forced to take refuge in a single isolated room with no means of exit.Word to the wise, however, this game can be rather frustrating at times. This is especially the case on those occasions where you are inexplicably sent back to the beginning of the level. This is most likely an attempt to explain the philosophical principal that time as an entity is cyclical rather than linear, but even then it can be irritating when you are nearing the end of the level only to have to start over for no reason.In a nut shell: Is 'Knock Knock' worth buying? Yes. Definitely. Is it for everyone? Not sure. If you're patient and enjoy genre games as an exploration of profound metaphysical concepts then you'll love it. If you just want a no brainer with cheap thrills, not so much."
76561198141404871,Recommended,250380,22764545,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,joan4003,"Knock Knock is Dark Souls meets The Stanley Parable which plays hide and seek with Amensia: The Dark Descent.  According to the game one should play at night in the dark, alone (and most likely with headphones on).The biggest Steam complaints I found in the reviews was this game was repetitive and frustrating.  What RPG game, for example, Dark Souls, is not repetitive and frustrating, and just because Knock Knock has no blood splatter and gut spillage that does not mean one does not die.  Which happens more often then one is lead to believe.  (When one dies, it is done without fanfare.)  This of course leads to the entire campaign having to be redone from the beginning which is both frustrating and repetitive just like in Dark Souls (and screaming at the computer scene in utter frustration can occur).  Another comparison to be noted between the two is where as the player collects souls in Dark Souls, in Knock Knock the player collects time.  Each campaign though not timed until the much later levels is timed based.  The player must collect time to reach the dawn of the day either by surviving the night hours by watching the slow moving clock or finding a ""clock"" which speds up time (found only by turning on lights and remembering).  Running into the monsterous ""guests"" (some of whom will hunt the player down), let into the house through breaches of the dimensional fabric (which need to be closed or can be walked through) will lose the player time or their life. This whole game is one way, no level can be repeated, only the entire game once an ending is reached.Like The Stanley Parable this game gives the player no real clue as to the ""rules"" of play, what the game is about, the purpose of the character and his task or why the player should even be playing.  The narrative and storyline are told through the main character, known as The Lodger (though this is not mentioned in game) and later through diary pages.  The Lodger's actual job is world-ology and logging the changes around him.  Unfortunately, he is being kept awake at night, and part of his ""job"" is simply to keep the house.  To do this he turns on the lights during early hours of the morning and remembers the room contents.  This is not an easy task since the guests break lights and dimensional breaches occur.The atmosphere of the game is like Amensia: The Dark Descent, yet another game where the player has no clue about what is going on or even how to play.  As the player discovers each piece of the storyline this only ramps up the psychological anxiety and terror levels.  Also the physical horror found of Amensia: The Dark Descent is just as mystifying and just as terrifying as those monsterous 'guests' found in Knock Knock.  Though the nightmares of Knock Knock move slowly they are just as relentless in their pursuit and they talk to the player as they play hide and seek.  Fortunately they are easier to keep track of.  Running and hiding are always the preferred options, and playing hide and seek with them is an intrical part of the game.Gameplay:  In Knock Knock there are three distinct play areas: the house, the forest, and the ""eye"" house levels.  I also suggest playing with a controller over a keyboard but the choice of course is yours.  RT I do believe gives an overview of the house and its lay out.  The house randomly changes size and layout and gets bigger the further into the game one progresses.  This is a great way to find and keep track of certain ""guests"" since one can see them, almost.  Also like Amnesia: The Dark Descent there is a ""sanity"" meter which comes into play during the timed levels.  Once this meter shows up as a lightening bolt across the top of the screen, the player only has until it runs out to finish the rest of the game levels or the player get the super bad ending ""GAME OVER"" with no resolution and the character becoming quite insane.During the house play area the goal is to find the clock and start it.  This starts time which has stopped and the player needs time to move so the dawn will come.  Once the clock starts the house door opens letting in ""guests"" and allowing the player to leave.  The entire point of this level is to start the clock and leave the house.  (Turning on lights is optional, I discovered.  Lights on makes the character move faster but takes up much needed time during the later timed levels.)  In the beginning I suggest taking the time to turn on the lights and remember the rooms contents.  Remembering the room contents means one has a place to hide when one needs to.  In the later timed levels start the clock and leave the house as quickly as possible. (I suggest not even turning on the lights just leave.  Do not wait for the clock or dawn.  Just leave and move on.)The forest: There are four horizontal paths is the forest which can be stepped between vertically.  Making it through the forest as fast as possible comes in handy during the late game time levels.  Only during these particular timed levels will stationary ""guests"" show up.  Do not touch them for they steal much needed time.  Also in the forest the player will find the girl, who possesses reality fragments. (Ignore during the timed levels.)  Approaching the girl is tricky business, the player needs to be directly opposite her and have the character facing her.  Even then it is still tricky business.  Reality fragments are needed for the ""Good"" ending, the more the better.  There are a total of 8.  Each forest level yields only 1 reality fragment from the girl.The ""eye"" house: Utter frustration, especially during the timed levels and will make or break getting the ""Bad"" ending.  The eye on the map is the house where one encounters breaches and monsterous ""guests"".  Late in the game one also encounters the ""weeping one"" which gives diary pages and/or steals time.  When playing the timed levels for the ""Bad"" ending I suggest ignoring the ""weeping one"".  The house on this level gets bigger and bigger with more rooms and a harder path to follow to the front door.  This is the place where the game of hide and seek is played in earnest so turning on lights and remembering gives the player places to hide as the clock ticks toward dawn.  One can not leave this house until dawn when the clock is full of time.In this ""eye"" house is where the dimensional breaches occur letting in the ""guests"".  Try to get to a breach before it opens if possible.  Closing a breach costs time, but does not allow even more ""guests"" in.  There are moving guests who hunt the player down, and stationary guests who steal time and throw one out of the room if one turns the light on if they are in the room.  Running into one also steals time.  The player can also go through a breach into endless halls (I found three different ones).  According to one guide 2 reality fragments can be found in these breaches per ""eye"" house level.Basically this game must be played twice, once for the ""Good"" ending which I suggest doing first since it will take all the player's skill and understanding of how the game works to make it through the timed levels to get to the ""Bad"" ending.I recommend this game to those that want a challenging ""horror"" game (I would call this Horror-Lite) that has no blood, guts, torture or screaming.  Hope one can play Hide and Seek well."
,Recommended,250380,8791165,"Posted: 20 January, 2014",all,AmeliaKills,"This game is more about ""experiencing"" than ""playing"" to me. I really don't like talking about the whole immersion thing, still I can't hesitate in this case. It really IS immersive, creepily strange, calm in its madness, thought-provoking and interesting in its own way. Can't wait to get the right mood to play it again from the beginning to the (happy this time, I hope) end.I wouldn't recommend it to everyone though. Some may see only a boring story about turning lights on and off here. Some may say it's too short. Some may dislike the ""lack of logic"" or just can't ""feel"" the atmosphere. But if you think you're crazy enough to learn the rules of the Game - turn off the lights, close the door and wait for your Guests to come. :)"

,Recommended,250380,24004658,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,Leafy,"I love this game. I first saw it years ago, but even as just a viewer, I was sucked in by the strange atmosphere and style. It's probably not a game for everyone, though.The entire workings of the game are shrouded, hinted at by Lodger, his journal, and even the voices you can hear whispering to you, but it's not entirely clear what actions you take really are helping or harming you. It can take a bit of thought and practice to get a sense of what you feel you should do. But that's exactly what I like about the game. It's like you're walking through an unfamiliar house in pitch darkness, trying to feel your way through with just your hands, uncertain of what you're really touching on but trying to get a sense of it. It's a lovely thing that describing what the game is about is exactly like describing what the gameplay is like. They've certainly captured it well.Few games gave me a feeling of tension like this game does. Sure, some games can be investing and I can feel a sense of urgency, but the only other game that gave me a pressing feeling of imminent danger the way Knock-knock did is probably Silent Hill 2. It has that same sort of atmosphere that imposes paranoia on the player, feeling uncertain if danger is really present, or how to cope with it. Even though the gameplay itself is simple, that doesn't really diminish it in any way for me. It's a simple experience, but a very effective one.The story is a favourite of mine, because they don't really give you much of one explicitly. It is left to interpret with the scraps of information and tidbits Lodger is constantly interrupting the game to chatter about. What does it all really mean? It's hard to say for sure, as there are many ways one can interpret Lodger's own state of mind, which is crucial to interpreting the rest of the goings-on around him. If you like a full, fleshed out story laid out in front of you, this game probably isn't for you. But it's the kind of game for me, where it leaves just enough visible to keep your interest and just enough hidden for you to wonder what it all really is. It's well-suited, again, as it fits with the idea of the game, with Lodger's paranoia filling in the emptiness of his home. Your own guessing and reguessing at what's really going on puts you in the headspace of this character and cements your immersion in the atmosphere of the game."

One of the most unusual, original, and hard-to-get-yer-noggin-around games I've ever played.  Even once you complete it, many a question remains, such as:  Why does your bleary-eyed scientist character speak in what I assume to be Russian (since that's apparently the origin of the game designers), while the ghosties who haunt him speak in English?  Why is his voice so high-pitched and squeaky, when he appears to be a grown man (albiet one with a face like an angry cherub)?  And what the ♥♥♥♥ is the deal with that endless corridor you keep finding yourself in, which seems to have no purpose other than to send you all the way back to the beginning of the chapter?!But by all means, if you're in the market for a game which doesn't seek to comfort you (in a psychological sense) or hand-hold you (in a gaming/mechanical sense), then this is one well worth picking up.  Just make sure you're in the mood for a little insomnia of your own, as the aforementioned ""cute""-ness is a Trojan horse and a half.  Prepare to be suitably mind-♥♥♥♥ed, boys and girls...oh, and speaking of which, if you google anything about the ending - or should I say, various ""endings"" - you'll see a mighty♥♥♥♥♥♥storm of controversy this subject has whipped up.  I won't go into it here, but suffice it to say there's been some ""design"" decisions made by the lovely folks at Ice-Pick which won't exactly go down well with everyone.  It certainly ♥♥♥♥ed me the first time I played, but I still enjoyed the game enough to just jump straight back in, and managed to get the ""good"" ending the second time through.  So there ARE rewards - including one of the oddest end credit sequences I've ever encountered - but man oh man, you have gots to EARN them!  Whatever you do, don't expect this game to treat you with kid gloves.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.Verdict: 9/10."

I'm not quite sure how to describe it... it certainly is surreal, abstract, spooky, and different, and unlike many horror games (especially the popular ones...), Knock-Knock's scares don't really come from its jumpscares (despite the jumpscares being startling as well), but rather, its ambience and the overall feeling of... dread and helplessness. Knock-Knock doesn't use blood and gore as nightmare fuel. Rather, it takes advantage of your own confusion, with almost unreliable tips from the protagonist (the Lodger), and many enemies that look and behave differently. I don't recommend this game to those who expect total guidance from the video games they play, nor do I recommend it to people who get frustrated from confusion, but I instead recommend Knock-Knock to those who are getting bored of jumpscare-fests and gore, for Knock-Knock's scare factor comes from its subtlety and psychological absurdity. Even if the game isn't the scariest one around, it's worth it for its unique presentation."

Knock-knock is a side-scrolling horror game that focuses on time and stragegizing your movements. do you want to keep the lights on to find hiding spots aswell as clocks that speeds up time? or do you keep the lights off to see the enemies movement in a trade off for low walking speed? Knock-knock makes you think your actions carefully.You play as the lodger. a male nature scientist who has had trouble sleeping, and has started to hear weird knocking noises around his home. Due to his lack of sleep, he gets easily amnesia on where his own furniture is and later on, he goes out to the woods to check if everything is allright. He returns home, only to find out that the ""guests"" are coming.In Knock-knock. you play as the lodger who has to survive till sunrise. there are two types of stages, home stages and the eye stages. in the home stage. You need to speed up time by finding a clock. clocks speeds up time in the game, which is necessary to advance in the home stages. Once you use it, the door out to the woods will open. You go out to the woods to check it and then find your house again to advance to the eye level. eye levels are the levels where the enemies will come and your job this time is to survive till sunrise. find clocks to speed up time, leading you further and further towards dawn. The eye levels become harder and harder as you progress more in the game. when you complete the eye level, you advance to the next home stage.Knock-knock contains not much replay value and sometimes the gameplay can be unfair. but it's good for acheivement hunters and is a good time killer, if you're bored. i'd recommend this."

I loved the creepy setting at first but after doing that level over and over again and seeing the same assets and sound effects used it becomes merely an annoyance. I checked online to see if more interesting events pop up later on in the game but it seems like pretty much the entire game is just wondering the houses over and over again.

This game *deserves* my full attention. The sound effects are nice n' creepy, the locations and characters are beautifully drawn, and I'm really digging the plot. The Lodger is appropriately self-aware, and there's something about the twisted Simlish that he speaks in that reminds me of the narration at the beginning of Lars VonTrier's ""Riget"". I like the mechanic of going into the rooms and waiting for the furniture to fade into view -- it may be repetitive, but that just adds to the dreamlike atmosphere.This is not an action game. This is not full of adrenaline-boosting jump-scares. This is for when you have insomnia, and need something to make you feel like falling asleep ever again would be a bad idea.

The game's great and all, but 'figuring it out for yourself' can sometimes be annoying when we have to meet certain criteria at a certain point in the game. It's definitely fun and interesting, but nothing that really kept me on the edge of my seat. I mean, at first when I didn't know what the hell was going on, half the time I thought something was about to come ♥♥♥♥ my day up.

This game is about solitude and maybe also about doubts and confusion, at least for me it is.Knock-Knock won't tell you what to do and why, it just tells you what you can do, like you can walk around, fix lights, unlock doors, ""restore"" the rooms of your house and hide from those disturbing entities who haunt your house, but it's up to you to figure out what's going on.While you play the game it plays you. Yet don't think Knock-Knock is something like those art games with no gameplay and ""too deep for you"" kind of narration. It has interesting, maybe a little repetitive gameplay that allows you to experiment with your playstyle.Though I have to warn you, you might get a Game Over in the end, it's not a bug, just a weird way to tell you you were trapped in the nightmare for too long and you've lost your chance to save your sanity in the end.At last but not the least I can't end this review without telling you how much passion and effort was put into creating and fine-tuning the atmosphere through art and sound.Again, this is a game you'll either love or you'll hate, but if you love it, Knock-Knock might easily end up to be one of the best games of 2013 for you as much as it is for me."

Is it an obtuse indie puzzle game based around survival, horror, time and avoidance strategies with a hauntingly surreal and bizarre atmosphere?I believe this is one of the few games i have played - and i have played many dear reader of this review - which transcends categories and works on a more abstract artisitic approach. I have been completely terrified while playing this game in the dark; dumbfounded and confused by the claustrophobia and wretchness of the night and how time  -  and this is all about time - personified by the imagery of clocks which wind forward and at times backwards if- consumed by the creepy and unnerving monsters - to the end of the night and to the comfort of sleep only if you can let in the horror with all the knock-knocking.The art design of the game is incredible with fantastically sharp tones and well desinged monsters. The sound is of such a great quality with bold, piercing screams and loud bangs which will shred your nerves.I did feel that the developers were teasing at times with all of the waiting and a particularly unforseen ending but i love that as i prefer being confused as opposed to molly coddled by a big AAA game.This game is very unhinged, bold and outthere.

Prefer if it went back to the start of the demon showing up...Beyond that, it's a good game to play in the dark (best experience too). There seems to be some sort of mystery of what's happening to the guy, butI haven't beaten the game yet to find outit doesn't explain much of it... there's some story going on but it's purely up to speculation.The concept of Hide and Seek is interesting though in this game. There are certain rules to follow and you are often given forshadowing signs of what to do. Once you understand the rules, it'll be a breeze.Controls are simple and basic. I had issues with video quaility at first, but after messing with settings I got it to work properly. (If I couldn't get it fixed on my end I would've requested a refeund as the quality I was getting was bothering me and ruining the immersion).Eventually the gameplay does get tedious with nothing new to add or offer after awhile. The difficulty shifts constantly though: may get lucky in one level but be stuck in another for several attempts.I have no other issues with this game. I would get this on sale though, but up to you on that.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish."

If you've tried any of their previous games and enjoyed them, you'll like this one. If you've never played their games, things get a little more complicated. Let me explain:I've been playing the game for 4 hours, and I can only say 2 things for certain about it:1) Wha...?2) This is russian as ♥♥♥♥. (yeah, the f word is required).The game is rather simple, or so it seems: you're in a house and you fix lights around the rooms. Kinda like one of those LCD games in the 80's, except with a look not unlike what Tim Burton's really evil twin would draw (the art and sound in the game are simple, but very amazingly unsettling and well done). It's not long into the game until you start noticing things are not so straightforward as they seem. And not long after that when you start double guessing the game. And then triple guessing.It's a game not about lights, but about discovering the actual rules of the game world. It has an eerie mythology well delivered, dreamy, oppressive and omnipresent, but still just drip fed to you, making you fill in the gaps and take risks in your interpretation of what's actually going on and what you should do about it. This is a game for detectives, not of the pixel hunt adventure type, but of the old Lovecraftian type.If you are going to try the game, you have to be okay with not being told everything (actually, you're told very little and you have to guess, test and learn very much). It's a game about gut feeling as much as logic, about trial and error, except getting things right is not always what you really need, and getting things wrong ... Well, I don't know about that, because a few hours in I'm starting to fourth-guess the game.If you're curious, you like powerful art, if you like mythologies and ambience, or if you like thinking about systems and finding out how things work with no help at all, give it a try at a reduced price. If you're a fan of Ice-Pick as I am, get it and support them, you'll not be disappointed.Just remember: this game is russian as ♥♥♥♥. You (YOU the player) are not a hero. You are just a helpless nutshell floating in a sea of doubt in the middle of the thunderstorm of the story. Only it's reaining ghost forest monsters from another dimension. Or maybe from your inconscious mind. Or maybe it's a second personality of yours. Or something. Be okay with feeling like that and you'll love the game."

Basically, the game is played in two rounds - the 'dream' round in which you explore the house and avoid monsters, and the 'dawn' round, where you explore the woods and try to find your way back home. Both rounds are very rich in story and atmosphere, which makes them fun to play, but the 'dawn' sections have a problem - your house does not always appear in the same place you found it the first time. There are good reasons not to enter the house immediately and take the time to explore the forest more, but doing so often leaves you stuck in a loop, constantly just walking around waiting for your house to reappear. This takes away from the frantic action of the 'dream' sections.There are also some frustrating moments in the 'dream' section of the game. There are times when monsters spawn directly on top of your character, or else extremely close by, which of course makes them impossible to avoid. There are also times when, on the way to complete an objective, the game will lock you out of the adjoining room by turning it into a trap room. You can unlock the room, but doing so puts you in an endless corridor where there is a high chance of having to restart the level. Finally, there's no guarantee that hiding will save you from the monsters - there seems to be a high chance of them finding you regardless of where you choose to hide (although perhaps this is the game's way of telling you that some places are better for hiding than others).None of these problems are game-breaking, however, and even with these frustrating moments Knock Knock is a really fun, scary game to play. The scares are actually really scary, but you quickly pick up on ways to avoid them so the game becomes more than a jump-scare generator. The player character is very relatable, and you quickly become immersed in their story. You can use different playstyles to complete the game, and there are plenty of collectables to keep replayability an option.One last thing - it's very important that you keep the sound on. You'll see why."

It's pretty and has elements of a good backstory, but there are huge gaps. It also gets very repetitive very quickly. Now there are quite a few 2nd side-scrollers that are ""horror"" and ""psychological thrillers"" and they all suffer from the same problem: cheap jump scares and simple tales based around sanity or the lack thereof. A pyschological thriller needs more than a forgetful character who can't tell the difference between dreams and reality to make it good, and there has to be more than jump scares (monsters appearing out of nowhere) to make it a horror. If you're young or you haven't been exposed to many movies or books that are really in the horror and pyschological thriller genre, you'll probably like this. If you're an old gamer like me who has been out of the house and read a few scary books, you'll be disappointed with this.Not sure why my time has not beed registered -- I played offline nearly the entire time. I guess that's why. I played it to the end in the hopes things would get better but it never did. I always enjoyed the visuals but the gameplay? Meh.How much should you pay for it? Well, I believe that it's worth something. It is worth $4.99 or less. If you pay any more than that, you've paid too much."

My main gripe is that they included a timer in the game and if you take too long exploring the sights or getting caught mid-game you'll be locked into an unavoidable game over later in the game, unable to finish, forcing you to start from the beginning.

It dealt a lot with the human mind and what isolation can do to a person.  The game was genuinely scary at some points (mostly a few jump scares when you turned around and ran into a monster for the first few times), but I considered the atmosphere more pleasantly spooky than terrifying.  I actually enjoyed getting home for the day and playing this game, in a way it was kind of comforting.  For some reason I could very much identify with the main character, and his insights via journal entries and dialogue did really strike a cord with me sometimes (but YMMV on that one).  A good title for people just getting into Horror games and aren't quite ready to jump straight to the terrifying stuff (i.e., Amnesia) or people who want a slightly different Indie Horror title with solid style."

I like Knock Knock a lot.The premise is that you're a fellow living alone in a cabin out in a forest. I won't spoil the story, but it's multifaceted, told both from the main character's unsteady perspective, through the environment (and even the enemies), and through a series of diary pages. Each says something different and feeds into the atmosphere.The graphical style actually kept me from buying the game for a while - not because it was bad, but because I expected something in the vein of Don't Starve, another stylized game with a much lighter atmosphere. I was surprised to find a dark and rather frightening tale of loneliness, insanity, and headless monstrosities in strait-jackets stalking me down hallways.Sound design is fantastic - the main character sounds a bit like the Professor from Luigi's Mansion (which is a bit of an immersion break), but if you can get past that the horrible disembodied voices of the enemies, the creaking of doors and boards, the sound of distant winds and laughter and moans are all fantastically done.The gameplay is effectively walking from room-to-room, turning on lights and materializing furniture that you can hide from said monstrosities behind. The game deliberately hides how to play it from you, the player, and thus you must try to figure it out for yourself. To some this may be offputting, but once I realized that this was intentional I became far more positively disposed. The gameplay has been said to get a bit stale after a while, but I myself found that the game mixed things up from level-to-level enough to keep me more than invested. Maybe I'd enter a level and there would be a series of basements in a row, maybe a danger of some sort (trying not to spoil anything) would appear in one room at the other end of the house and I would have to find a way to hide and try to survive instead of driving this danger away myself.Ultimately, I haven't finished Knock-Knock yet but would recommend it for anyone who's a fan of horror and not being led-by-the-nose everywhere in a video game.

The game doesn't give any hints/clues or explanation to how to play or to what is actually going on, you need to figure out that your self. There is as others have mentioned a lot of repetitive movements around in the house, like walking from room to room and switch on the light. You will do this most of the time, but during this, I felt very much confused and stressed. You don't know if something will happen in the next room or where you should go to feel safe and secure. I easily emphasized the poor guy, the nights are really a nightmare!You can definitely replay it depending on the outcome of your first play-through. I had to play it immediately after my first, since I needed to see if I could do something different or understand the game better. The outcome got a little better the second time. But I'm going to play it again sometime to get the best ending!Try it if you want a little horror game that is different and absurd and you don't mind repetitive gameplay!"

The other 3 there is a bad, normal and god. But it is very complicated to understand alone the steps for each of them.The game is very cheap and entertaining, the gameplay lasts on average 1 h 30 minjogo extremamente simples, porém é bem divertido de jogar e com graficos cartunescos ao estilo Tim Burton (assustador e horripilante).os controles são simples e responderm bema trilha sonora é quase enexistente para dar clima de terror ao gamea parte negativa é a falta de informações do que deve ser feito, o que pode acabar de frustando quando ao final do jogo.Existem 4 finais possiveis, sendo que um deles é impossivel vc terminar o jogo e tem uma tela de game over a parte final. Os outros 3 existe um ruim, normal e god. Mas é muito complicado de entender sozinho quais os passos para cada um deles.O jogo é bem baratinho e diverte, o gameplay dura em média 1 h 30 min"
