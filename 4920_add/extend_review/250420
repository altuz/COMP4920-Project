,Not Recommended,250420,30049785,Posted: 19 February,all,Jon Ackbar,I joined this game for a bit. Runescape is better by about 95% I'd say. And I'm not a big fan of runescape either

One thing to note however is that it does lag slightly.  For example, at 10:30 PM on a Monday, it lags alot.  However, the game is still fun and  I recommend you get it."

,Not Recommended,250420,29729417,Posted: 5 February,all,SurpriseGmg,This is the first Steam game I've actually uninstalled. That should give you an idea of how bad it is.
,Recommended,250420,29836372,Posted: 10 February,all,TrueCringe,Well this game was hard to put down in words but here we go. So this game is fun it runs nice and its very addicting grinding for items. Bosses are fun you can make things. This game is free so just get it its fun.6/10

,Not Recommended,250420,29697844,Posted: 4 February,all,Sanic,"ZiltoidCritic Review - 8BitMMOHere is my review of this piece of garbage known as 8BitMMO (is garbage the right word? HEY JERRY, THIS SEEMS A BIT HARSH!)Story:Well this is easy. There is none. An MMO has to have a purpose other than just run around and kill things. This can be improved on and needs to be acted upon fast.Soundtrack:The soundtrack is awesome! I'll give you that. The chiptune sounds in this make the music stand out and feel like 4 NES consoles battling to produce the best sound. This is one of the only high points.Art / Sprite work:The sprites in this game are well drawn apart from the default main character. It's a little bit too plain for my liking. You could've put a shirt and some pants on the guy and I would've liked it more but just plain white is kinda boring.Gameplay:The game controls poorly and has a weird ""momentum"" mechanic in it that changes your speed between two different settings. The first setting is really slow and the first setting makes you feel faster than Sonic the Hedgehog. The thing is weird and using E as the interact button really messed with my head because I was trying space bar and Z and X and everything. E was my last guess.POSITIVES -* Good Soundtrack* Decent Spritework* Great Server ConnectivityNEGATIVES -* Poor Controls* No Story* Confusing Mechanics* Perspective IssuesDISCLAIMER:This is just my opinion. You are free to have what ever opinions you like."

,Recommended,250420,29712653,Posted: 4 February,all,BazzJay,8BitMMO is a alright game but it has some bugs.It seems that soon as i load into the main server i can do everything but after 3 or less seconds my keyboard wont work and im left to use only my mouse.its a pain and after going through every website and faq to fix theres nothing.otherwise its alright but is a bit boring and needs more mechanics or more items / complex things and better missionsPlease Update.
