,Not Recommended,250460,8864495,"Posted: 26 January, 2014",all,CastingCake64,"At first I thought this game might be very fun to play. I remember playing a bridge construction game back in middle school and was insanely fun due to the fact how the player can remove all restirctions and make any bridge, anyway you want. That is NOT the case with this game. There is almost no creative input by the player. There is pretty much one way to make the bridge on each specific level and the game will very rarely stray from the design the game designers had in mind, the smallest change will cause the whole bridge to collaspe. I just wish I had the ability to make a bridge the way I wanted to make it, be free of logic and budgets to simply HAVE FUN, but that is not the case with this game. One might find enjoyment in the way how you have to figure out how to do it, but not me. It's like having a bunch of legos but I'm not allowed to make anything I want to make and I'm not given any istructions on how to make something from a set. For all I know, perhpas there's is a reward of unlimited freedom if one beats this game, but I have lost all patience with this game and refuse to play it anymore."

But is there a category for an object that falls under both?  There is.  That category is called 'Bridge Constructor'.Perhaps you think, ""No! Bridge Constructor is not an art game; it is an engineering game.""  To which I say, ""Non Monsieur/Madame/Mademoiselle, non!""  Then I finish my thought in English because that is all the French I know.  Remember, you arenot actually constructing bridges in the real physical world(apologies if you thought that this game might let you do that).  You are creating simulations, models, dreams of your inner self.  What you create on screen is you; you are what you create on screen.  I repeat: once you play this game, there will be bridges inside of you.It should also be known that this game tells the story of a world.  Do you wonder what drives the cars, the trucks, the tankers?  Wonder no more my friend: it is a race of little insect people.  Ants?  Bees?  Weevils?  I do not know: insects.  All I know is that they cannot fly.  If they could, they would not need bridges.-------------- The Story of JD7QW --------------Designate JD7QW buckled the seatbelt around his carapaced waist, its legs quivering as it did so.  It tried to hide its fright, but even from outside the tanker truck the Planner noticed.""JD7QW,"" the Planner said, its mandibles clicking furiously, ""this is no time for fear.  You are performing the function for which you were produced, as am I.  By testing this bridge we are expanding the reach of the Colony and celebrating the greatness of the Queen.  That is all we can do.  That is all we shall do.""Not daring to look at the Planner, JD7QW nodded while fixing its gaze straight ahead.  The bridge in front of it was very wooden and very straight.  It also appeared very fragile, like sunlight on water.  How could it hold the weight of the enormously flammable tanker?  ""I imagine that there are supports underneath?"" JD7QW asked, doing its best to hide its anxiety.  ""Steel?  Perhaps concrete?""""Such questions!"" the Planner snapped.  ""I will answer, but know that I will be filing a Protest when I return to the Colony.""  It shook its engorged head.  ""It appears that the Breeders are producing defective Designates.""Again JD7QW did not dare turn around.  Instead it looked up.  The sky was cloudless and blue, so clear that the ghost of the moon could be faintly seen even in the daytime.I would like to fly there, the Designate thought suddenly.Such wonders I would see!But of course it couldn't.  Only the Queen was allowed to have wings.The Planner continued.  ""There is no steel.  There is no concrete.  There is wood and only wood.  But -""  The Planner's voice softened.  Surprised, JD7QW peeked over.  The Planner's mandibles had slowed, its multi-faceted eyes had grown clouded and dreamy.  ""- but oh, the design, the joins and triangles and descending supports, the interlocking wheels of pressure and release, the. . .""  Caught up in the Planner's vision, it allowed itself to think:Someday I shall be allowed to dream as well.Then the Planner shook its head.  Its voice turned to jagged stone.  ""No more!  You are impudent, JD7QW.  Drive now.  Go.""It stepped back.  Unwilling and unable to disobey, JD7QW depressed the gas pedal and the tanker truck rumbled forward.A short segment of paved road lay between the truck and the bridge.  It took both an instant and an eternity to cross.  Then JD7QW felt the wheels beneath himclunkas it rattled onto the wooden bridge, and right away it knew that it would not survive that day.The bridge was already beginning to sway, the surface to buckle.  A series of grand snapping noises echoed within the ravine, each one like the shattering of an enormous tree.  The truck began todescend; frantic, JD7QW pressed the gas pedal with all its strength.  The truck jerked forward, and for a moment the Designate thought that the vehicle might simply plow through the air to the other side, an invincible and impossible metal beast.Then the wooden surface below him imploded, and the truck fell in earnest.JD7QW barely had time to squeeze its eyes shut, to gag at the vortex in its stomach, when the fuel tank exploded.  Free of its burden, the cab of the truck shot up into the air, and the sudden reverse in sensation caused JD7QW's eyes to fly open in surprise.  And what it saw through the broken windshield was blue, endless blue, with the ghost of the moon traced far above.It knew there wasn't much time left.  With legs that were no longer trembling, it pressed the release on the seat buckle.The Designate shot out of the vehicle immediately.  Below him, the truck cab had already slowed and was falling back to earth.But not me, JD7QW thought.Now I shall fly.  I shall fly to the moon.And it began to smile as it dreamed of what it might find there.----------------------------------------There is a JD7QW inside all of us.  If not for yourself, play this game for it."
,Not Recommended,250460,32271312,Posted: 8 June,all,Bass][e,"★★☆☆☆My enjoyment of the game was always covered in the shadows of the rubble that was left by myimploded bridges.That's actually not solely a joke. Bridges and vehicles often times fly straight up; wood that should break, just fly of in a unrealistic direction. These physics is where the problem of this game lies. Since the game is all about physics, I can't recommend the game to anyone when that crucial part doesn't work.Multiple reviewers on Steam listed out a great array of examples of how inconsistant and unrealistic the mechanics are. You might be able to ignore this, as I tried to, but getting stuck on a map only to discover in guide that the reason you were failing was that you were using TOO MUCH wood, is just aggrevating. I discovered (for myself) a consistant, succesful type of bridge that would work most of the time, as long as the cables were available. Later on, I noticed that guides were using the same type.The type: a wooden bridge with just one or two lines of cables paralel going under it, saving an amazing amount of money everytime. It's also completely unrealistic, considering I've never seen a bridge like this in real life. When you do try and make a realistic looking bridge, which every player undoubtedly has tried, it would just break down and insulting you by doing so. For reference, look at the screenshots above. These won'l work on normal or hard difficulty (this is easy, as you can see cars, not trucks).Despite the great amount of levels you get for the price ( I paid 5 bucks including all DLC), I just couldn't bare more of the game after completing the main and first islands. My suggestion is check out Poly Bridge."

Each level has a set of materials and a budget to work within, but it is up to you how you want to end up bridging the gap. That’s not to say most of your “solutions” won’t fail miserably. You are also constrained by physics and the properties of the given materials. In addition, it is not enough that your structure simply doesn’t collapse under its own weight; it has to be able to support traffic of different loads. I’ve lost count of the number of times that some trucks barely made it to the other side as my bridge built with spit and good intentions fell into a shattered ruin in their wake. This makes even the failures entertaining as you look what when wrong and iteratively adjust your design until it works. I definitely recommend it to the engineering-minded as it will occasionally force you to think outside the box to solve the problem at hand."

Furthermore there are good guides helping you, if you cannot find a solution for your level.

76561198006217347,Recommended,250460,33871876,Posted: 28 July,all,Anticitizen1 [Raven Guard],"I am the Michael Bay of civil engineering, my bridges most of the time collapse in a spectacular fashion sending cars and trucks to their doom in the precipice below. Cables snap, supports break and tank trucks explode mid air. My creations are a sight to behold and will probably give any real civil engineer recurring nightmares but I do love them like a proud father holding up a deformed baby, ""he is a special one"" I say as the midwife gives me a mournful look. My favorite bridge was actually a success, at least according to the game, as I sent trucks down that bridge, the first support glowed an ominous red, when they cleared the midpoint of the bridge that support collapsed starting a slow downward movement of the left side of the bridge, that was okay though because just as the whole thing collapsed by first truck cleared the bridge and the second one was tumbling onto the road on the right side of the bridge. A spectacular success!!!On a serious note, it's not a bad game but the physics don't feel right and the resulting bridges that succeed according to the game look like abominations you will never see in real life more often than not. Get it on a sale but don't expect realistic physics."

,Not Recommended,250460,9918019,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,Harcuski,I bought this game a while back and well. Money not well spent. The game just feels like a simple touchscreen game that one would play on the toliet. The graphics are not good nor bad and the gamplay gets boring very fast. I picked this game up as when I was a kid in primary school we used to have a really basic bridge building game on our PCs which prob ran windows 95 or 98. The game was very basic but I spent ages just building bridges then sending cars over them. That game was years better than this and thats why I cant give this game a positive score.

Half-finished collision boxes and clipart menu graphics leave a bad first impression, but play into it a bit, and at its core are a collection of solid and well thought-out physics puzzles.My main problem with the game is that the physics are not consistent, which can be a severe detriment to a puzzle game (See Bad Rats), but here it doesn't seem to be a problem at all unless you're going for the ""Your bridge broke but you still made it"" achievement.I was surprised by the creativity of the puzzles. The first bridge that gives you a ""Checkpoint"", or a location your vehicles must drive through before reaching the goal, places the checkpoint almost directly below the starting location, forcing you to think up some insane motocross ramp to reach it safely. And it only gets wackier from there.Overall a thoroughly enjoyable puzzle game, if you like that sort of thing, with only a few problems that almost never seem to get in the way of gameplay."

The math behind the game is flawed and over simplified.Also, you are constantly limited by money and materials, which heavily stifles any design flair you might want to express. Complex and interesting designs are out of the question, because you can’t afford them. All the time you are reduced to the most basic designs.Add to that the fact that there isn’t a analysis mode that allows you to understand the forces on your bridge, and you end up with a rather basic game, that can be somewhat frustrating and boring. It is still good fun to play, but with a few simple additions and new modes of play, it could have been so much better!They should also have allowed you to build larger bridges. Even the largest in the game is really quite small.So, recommended? When it's on sale, yes, it is fun, just don't expect it to be too real-life, and don't for heavens sake pay full price for it!"

All the achievements work (thus all the bridges can be completed).I recommend you wait until the game goes on sale to get it if you're interested, as at the actual price (8.99€) the game isn't really worth it.Somebody will probably expect this review to have more information concerning the game, but there isn't to say. You build bridges for cars, trucks and tankers. You get a budget, and depending on how well you do, you get a higher or lower score.The devs did release quite a lot of free updates (Easter, Christmas, Halloween).EDIT: A problem that came up a few times is a pink-screen. Close the game, and choose a different graphical setting (instead of fantastic, switch to good, or whatever). If this doesn't fix the issue, streaming Steam videos at the same time as launching this game will also give you a pink screen. Close the video, launch the game, and then launch the video.

Its a little unfortunate that its tearing away me and his relationship because its the last pint of family I have after my parents were gunned down in a shopping mall and my wife was stolen and put into sex trafficing. At the very least its allowing him to cope with the loss of both his arms and legs in a bombing that happened at out local JC Penney. Anyway enough about me and more about this game. Its very fun and I finally got a chance to play it after smothering my son to death. It really gets your noggin joggin when you're trying to figure out how to make a bridge. One of my favorite features are the sound and music which were promptly both muted by me as soon as I started the game. But this game has a deep meaning that relates to the deep meaning of life. It's very depressing to watch the lifeless vehicles drive into a valley to their doom and as a side note this really makes me sad. The drivers of these vehicles could have families that they will never see again. I also love the variety of materials I get for building bridges like wood, steel, cable, and one other that I can't think of off the top of my head because there were just too many to even count. But the most important feature has got to be truck proofing your bridges because nothing else has ever made me wish I were dead more than watching cars easily cross a bridge just for some trucks to shatter it to pieces. In conclusion I have to say Poly Bridge is the superior game although I have to wonder what kind of person would buy a bridge building game in the first place?"

The devs spent 4 years making that cruddy DLC for this cruddy game and didn't bother to fix bugs? I don't even know how this has positive reviews. In 4 years, if I am functionally competent for that entire time, I can most likely make several hundred, or even thousands of Steam Workshop submissions.

I have literally yelled at my computer several times when I was only a segment away from making my bridge work with trucks, but it was worth it.While it appears simplistic, it feels realistic.  Although realistic it provides the perfect amount of goofyness to the game to keep me relaxed after my yelling.  The goofyness does nothing to detract from the gameplay, and only adds to it.  I can not express how much I love to play it.Only downside is the musical tracks, which pretty much becomes ambient after a while, which really makes it not a problem.Overall I give it a 9.5/10 due to the linear/limited gameplay aspect of it, but other than that, very well polished and well worth the money spent.I can dream for a sandbox bridge mode, right ;)?"

Yeah, you can build an ordinary triangle-shaped bridge and move onto the next stage, but the real fun is that you build an unconventional, yet cheaper bridge; you can make cars fly, make only one of two cars reach the end, etc. It's really surprising for palyers to do numerous things with just a simple game aspects, but with a great idea."

My only complaint is that it is in some SERIOUS need of some new game modes or DLC. Namely, in the form of a campaign mode that allows you to earn money based on how much traffic your bridges receive. With the toll money you make, you could build new bridges capable of handling more traffic and larger vehicles, allowing you to earn more money. This game, however, has none of that. Sometimes, you are constrained by a budget that only allows you to build the most laughable of temporary throw-away bridges that crumble on the first use. It also limits your options for construction materials seemingly arbitrarily. It really limits the fun factor. I'm all for a challenge, but when you want me to build a bridge tp cross a 300 foot gap with no support columns in between made of wood that can support a multi-ton fuel tanker-all on a budget of 30,000 dollars-that's where i draw the line. All I'm saying is GIVE ME OPTIONS. Limiting the building materials and budget only limits my creativity. So despite all this, why am I recommending this game? Because you get to build bridges, fool! Where else can you do that, sucka!!?"

Yes you old fart the one that came free with top end Geforce 4 graphics cards and the one that was blocked from running on anything with an Ati card in? This is that game! they have changed the front end a little to try to disguise it but underneath it all is a 10+ year old game that still plays as it did back then. I liked this game back when I was playing Team Fortress Classic and it's still fun now in between Battlefield. More improtantly though, you don't need an Nvidia card to run it, hell you barely need anything more than a calculator to run this!This game is a great distraction to play between serious gaming, and it will keep you scratching you head for ages. Don't pay full price though."

It's casual and relaxing, yet quite challenging.The gameplay is simple and easy to learn, but the physics can be kind of tricky. I am most of the way through the first set of islands (or whatever they're called) and I'm still discovering new ways to assemble my bridges.My only complaint is that the materials you can use are changed up with every puzzle. In other words, you don't ""earn"" the advanced materials and keep them as you continue play. The game just artificially constrains what you can use, so that's kind of annoying."
