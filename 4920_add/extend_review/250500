It was time they traveled to the West Coast in their trusty station wagon. Leading the group, HornyFishMan picks up his uzi. They hunt. Bandits attack. Some could even aim. They reach a river. They ford it. Boulders... so many boulders... and then the pirate ship attacked. Luckily, there was a rocket launcher in the river. A few quick shots, and it's down. Suck it, Blackbeard.The group enters the Great Plains. Buffalo buffalo buffalo. The number of buffalo was absurd. HurgaDerga is impaled by a buffalo, and I swear he will be missed. NuggleSnugg and HornyFishMan go on. Horny is healed by health kits that was bought, along with a flame thrower, with the buffalo hide. Remember, the ones that killed HurgaDerga? Revenge is sweet. They see a woman in a red dress. HornyFishMan stops to see if she needs help. It wasn't a trap, and she needs no help. She thanks Horny and sends him away. A civil war battle is underway nearby. The group says hello. There were no survivors.The group reaches another river. It was time the station wagon went underwater. Water buffalo water buffalo water buffalo. The group reaches an island. Horny notices supplies on the shore. He takes them. It was a trap! PELICANS! Luckily, he survives. They swim to shore.They reach a mountain pass. Food supplies were running low, so they hunted. No bandits this time, but wolves. So many wolves. They find a trader. They use the wolves they murdered to buy a double-barreled uzi. There is a snow storm, yet the wolves continue to attack. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... They deal with the wolves, and see a strange figure in the distance... Horny investigates.BIGFOOT! Horny runs at him, and having found another flamethrower in the snow, takes him down easily. It is now out of ammo, though, so he gets his double-barreled uzi back out. Infinite ammo rocks! He runs back to the wagon, and the snow storm was rough, so in their panic, they drive off a cliff.Buffalo followed HornyFishMan and NuggleSnugg off the cliff. So many buffalo. They dodge all the buffalo, and manage to land safely in a river. Having lost their wheels, the station wagon became a raft. They navigated through boulders and fought off alligators. Then they reached a bandit ambush. The bandits attacked with shotguns on their rafts. Successfully defending themselves from the bandits, alligators, and boulders, the group could see the West coast. They almost made it! But then a bandit showed up. He had found some sort of steam boat. Lighting up the boat as much as possible, it wasn't enough. A bandit holding a shotgun on top of the steam boat fired, and Horny wasn't quick to the dodge. NuggleSnugg joined Hurga, after all this time. She came so far, and it didn't even matter. Horny, in all his rage, blew up the boat with his uzi, ending his bandit problem. Reaching shore, Horny shoots pelicans in celebration. He made it to the West coast, though he lost his best friends. He will never forget that fateful Super Amazing Wagon Adventure."

,Recommended,250500,11506924,"Posted: 1 August, 2014",all,coldfrog,"Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a randomly generated sidescrolling shooter that banks on a couple things: goofiness, nostalgia (slightly) and not caring too much about shooter games.If I was to judge it purely based on its mechanics, it's not much more than mediocre. The weapon options are nothing too special, and the enemies mainly rely on strength of numbers to add challenge. The boss fights that I've experienced so far were OK but no big deal.What really is entertaining is the silly nature of the entire endeavor. The game takes a lot of cues from Oregon Trail and basically makes fun of every option.""There is a river. [Tom] has the brilliant idea to jump over it. Or, you could try fording it.""[Ford][Jump]And then you can actually jump over the river if you want to.Other times you might be attacked by modern cars or ""inner demons"", and the text that accompanies almost every event is weird and goofy. And it works almost every time, and because the game is so quick to play (the game I won probably took between 5-10 minutes) and there are a lot of options, it hasn't yet gotten old.But it probably will eventually. And when I'm tired of seeing a million buffalo charge at me for the hundredth time, then I'll probably stop because all it has left are the mechanics, which, as stated, really aren't much special.Still, it doesn't cost much, and it still plays much better than the far more tedious McPixel (I don't know why I feel the comparison is necessary - highly pixelated graphics and bite-size gameplay I guess, but nothing else much is in common so *shrug*) and I still foresee getting some quality time out of it, so I would recommend it!"

You can only fire directly in front of you, making it sometimes difficult to shoot incoming enemies that clip the edges of your wagon.The controls were a bit hard to get used to at first; you move with WASD and press the spacebar (or mouse button) to shoot, but in scenes where you're walking around outside the wagon, the game plays like a top-down shooter like The Binding of Isaac, Hotline Miami, Nuclear Throne, etc. in that you move with WASD and shoot with the four directional arrow keys (or use the mouse cursor for more versatile accuracy). Of course, all these controls can be remapped as you desire, and even comes with gamepad support if you want to use a controller.Overall, this game refuses to take itself seriously, so why should you? This game is understandingly hard and it's easy to get frustrated, but given the nature of the game and how it's executed, I can't help but laugh every time I inevitably lose."
,Recommended,250500,16489924,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,Celtic7Guardian,"Short version: This game has unicorn ambushes, rabid squirrel attacks, and river jumping. You should buy it.Slightly longer version: This game is merciless, unforgiving, and totally ruthless, just as an Oregon Trail homage should be. You are in a wagon and have a gun to shoot things. Sometimes you get out of the wagon to shoot things. If you are lucky you get medical recovery items and better guns, from shotguns to carpet-bombing airplanes. If you are not lucky, your three characters get horrible diseases and die to machine-gun-armed bandits and Civil War fights. More often than not, the latter will build up and have your journey end terribly.What keeps the game from getting overly frustrating (at least for me) is the humor. This game is hilarious, and it has everything from dinosaurs to satellites. The narration is fantastic, and it is worth playing for that alone. It's why I got the game, despite usually not being a fan of these types of games. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure was just too funny to skip.It controls well, once you get the hang of it. I personally am terrible with keyboards for games, but from how it felt, I'm fairly certain a keyboard-savvy player will usually be perfectly fine. There are plenty of options as well, ranging from a number of wagons you can unlock to survival modes. With the numerous scenarios your playable party can get into, it has high replayability.This game is $3 for a base price, and the witty narration is worth that alone. Add in the other great factors, such as the unlockables and tight controls, and you have a huge winner. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go back to dying to buffalo."

I absolutely recommend this game 100%.Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a game that made the YouTube rounds a while back and for very good reason.  It's one of those absurd hilarious games that just refuses to stop surprising you hour after hour.  It starts off as a pretty standard Oregon Trail inspired adventure as you customize your party, and pick a wagon.  Then after that first ten seconds I'm pretty sure the game takes a handful of shrooms and maybe coke right to the face and goes completely off the rails.  This game isn't trying to have a compelling narrative, it doesn't want to be IGN's game of the year, and it's not trying to tun the industry upside down with it's wicked angsty edginess.  No, SAWA is a game that just wants to be fun.  It wants to take you an adventure infused with pure randomness and heart of comedy gold.  You'll jump rivers and end up in space, you'll go looking for food and end up tripping balls, you'll be making your way across the plains and then fighting a Buffalo filled tornado.  A FREAKING BUFFANADO!Visuals- The atari style graphics are simple yet endearing, and the color is perfect for the cartoony feel.  It's not winning any awards but it's perfect for the game.Replayability- This game has it!  Not because this game offers new wagons and things to unlock, but because you just can't stop from wondering what could be next.Sound-  Similar to the visuals, it's good but not mindblowing.  It's everything this game should be.Gameplay_  The shooting can be a bit on the garbage side which is a shame.  You'll die a surprising amount, and what you die from will usually be even more surprising.  This game at points doesn't seem to follow any rules either.  I was once killed by a bear with no way to defend myself.  If this kind of thing bothers you, may be best to look else where."

There is also a degree of rogue-like flow to your journey; whilst elements of your trip are fixed by geography and time, others are... significantly less predictable.I bought this game for like 50p in a sale and then have since bought about another ten copies because everyone needs to see this craziness."

Great sense of humor, but the lack of any truly addictive qualities makes this game very easy to put down.  There is nothing wrong with it, really.  There is just not much terribly right with it.  Very neat little game, good for at least a few minutes of entertainment if arcadey is not your thing.extended:This is more or less a series of extremely simple minigames strung together seemingly at random.  Most can be summarized as such: clumsily move around on the screen while dodging pixelated blobs and clicking to fire slow-moving bullets at such.  It can be amusing to see some of the situations described or depicted in the game, but the gameplay itself is lacking.  The controls are just clumsy enough that you never get into that addictive, edge-of-your-seat frenzy that the best arcade games can inspire.  Still, they are not so bad as to incite you to throw your peripherals at the monitor, and there is something to be said for character.If there were an option for, ""Maybe"" instead of a simple yes or no, I would choose it.  That's a rare thing for me, because I am usually pretty opinionated about the games I play.  To put it in perspective, if I had paid $5 for this game instead of $2 on sale, I would feel extremely ripped off.  But for what I paid, I can appreciate the value.  Given all of this, I will err on the side of being positive and recommend the game."

I find that very few games put me into fits of belly laughter, this is one of those few games that did just that. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure combines 2D side scrolling shooting, peppered with the occasional Robotron style shooter, all wrapped up into an adventure that's different on every playthrough. Obviously this is the game's main hook, and part of the reason why the game is so hilarious. You just can't write♥♥♥♥♥♥like that in real life, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure doesn't even need to try... Seriously, upon my first playthrough, I named my three adventurers (two of them being my best friends and housemates), the games randomly generated story decided that I was going to contract purple fever, help save a train from being hijacked, fall in love with one of my partners (who just happens to be my best mate), ""relieve ourselves"" in the wagon, all before we all died outrunning an erupting volcano, whilst dodging wolves that were on fire.... Amazing!Oh, and there's an awesome chiptune-ish soundtrack and a gorgeous TV scanline effect, mimicking the asthetics of the old Atari 7800 games.

It features unlockable wagons and music that accents the games lighthearted and pleasant qualities.As for the actual gameplay itself, however, it is a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up, when in the wagon, which is of course most of the time. Who ever went to Oregon on foot, that's silly and extremely dangerous.At first glance, it's simplistic, not much challenge in it. But the rapidity of your movement, the size of your hitbox, and the sheer number and speed of hostile entities makes this game, for better or for w̶o̶r̶s̶e̶  better, a Bullet Curtain.

My brother and I left him, where we shortly thereafter battled a pirate ship in a small river that shot my brother with a cannonball. I managed to destroy the ship and continued onward, where I died in a large field of buffalo. Overall one of the single most hilarious five-minute singleplayer adventures I have ever had the pleasure of undertaking. 10/10"

Bandits, wild animals, zombies and mother nature are trying to stop you from reaching your goal.So what do you do? Offense is the best defense, right? So just shoot everything!Your starting wagon gives you only a weak pistol, but you might find a lot of other weapons on your way, including shotguns, flamethrowers, bazookas and even an airstrike!Unlock more wagons with better starting weapons, including the Diseased, which spreads disease! Or how about the Glitch, which shoots...stuff!Most of the time the game is a sidescrolling shooter. You man your wagon and fire away, but once in a while you'll have to leave your wagon and fight on foot and it's fun all the way.It might be a bit unfair from time to time, depending on what scenes you end up in, but the game is rather short anyway, so just try again!

Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is *not* fair though, so prepare to die. A lot. When there's more or less nothing you could do about it.Your hitbox is the entire wagon (large), but the area your default weapon can attack is one small line right ahead of you. You will get hit many, many times by enemies just above or just below this area charging toward you. Anyone who makes it to the Buffalo will know what I mean. There are other weapons, but there's no way to store or change them, so if you get something that could help you later you can prepare to fire it off about two minutes before you really need it.Your wagon has three passengers, among whom damage is ""shared"". Hits land not-really-randomly on your party members, often hitting and killing one person before the other two. It's possible to get hitpoints back but this happens on a purely random basis, and consists of either events that may or may not happen or medkit pickups you may not be able to reach. The frustration that comes when you find a rare event only to realize it's your 1-HP guy instead of your 4-HP guy that you have to try to finish it with... agonizing.There's some laughs to be had here; I thought it was hilarious when I had the option to either ford a river or jump over it, and then later either go around or swim under the river. There's also a ton of content and different paths your adventure might take; I was still finding new ones until I finally quit playing.It's a shame I'm not going to see the end of the game though because I cannot put up with these deaths that I have no real control over. If the hitbox on the wagon was a lot smaller and my gun could aim a little I'd probably play the hell out of this game. Sadly, I'm sick of it and going to see if I can get a refund."

It feels just like it lacks a lot in gameplay, as things are just greatly difficult to accomplish and in the beginning you just depend on your luck if you want to get far.It's biggest sale point, the randomness of events is... not really that big. Yes, there is a variety of things that can happen to you, but it seems to like there isn't really that much variety.You always follow a specific basic path, which then has several options of what could happen to you. Sometimes, you can make the decision, like jumping or fording a river, which basically means having the chance for a random event, like having to dodge bees or asteroids. The other decision will have you... dodge... boulders.If you play it and then die and play it again, you will soon realize that there isn't really that much variety in what will happen to you. And, because the game sometimes just throws undodgeable obstacles in your way, faster than a human being could possibly react to, dying will happen to you a lot.Also you seem to be very limited in what you can do. The weapons, which the game will not really let you choose to fire it or conserve it, always have very limited ammo. You have, if you coun't all the party members, 12 points of health, from which the game sometimes RANDOMLY decides to take a quarter away. You either heal from (quickly appearing) health pickups or from random events.The game has a real good soundtrack though, and the design is mostly nice to look at, the sound effects also appear to be fitting and they don't get annoying.The text ""scrolling"", which is not in your hand, even on the fastest setting, was still too slow for me. Why not let me decide when to skip the text?In conclusion, the game has some sort of variety and the random events are funny at first, but they get old quickly. The gameplay doesn't have much variety, where I would really have appreciated to put more effort in. It doesn't cost a lot, so it doesn't really hurt to try it out, but I for myself, did not pull a lot of enjoyment out of it."

However, since I bought Half-Life on Steam during a sale for $1.99, I think I am entitled to complain.This game is something you would normally see on a flash games website, good for maybe a half-hour of entertainment before it gets boring.  To make matters worse, all of the wagons need to be unlocked through achievements save for the default one.  It also provides little real challenge other than twitch response in terms of gameplay.  The gameplay consists of being flashed a ""random"" message, then being thrown into a scenario that usually involves shooting animals, people, or dodging obstacles.  However, after a half-hour of play, I was seeing the same events every other run.  It turns out that the game isn't procedurally generated in the traditional sense, other than the random location of enemy spawns.  There are certain events that are fixed, such as crossing rivers, where the player is presented with a choice on how to do so.  However, most events that have a chance occur are linked to other events that is required to immediately follow, such as burning buffalo during a prairie fire only happens if there was a prarie fire, which only happens if there was a herd of buffalo, which happens every time upon entering the Great Plains level.  So there is actually not much variety in gameplay, since the event generation seems to only be based on two possible outcomes, often y/n, if a --> b ?, or based on player choice.But I would forgive all of this, even LOVE IT, if the game was just fun to play past the 1 hour mark.  But instead, it becomes a tedious and annoying mess of screen ghosting after that.  Save your ten bucks for something worthwhile."

Essentially you are thrown into a variety of bizzare scenarios where you shoot and dodge stuff for about 30 seconds or less, and then there's a short transition and you're suddenly somewhere else shooting and/or dodging other stuff. For example, you might be crossing a river dodging boulders, and then you'll make it across the river and into the prairie where you'll gun down some buffalo. The general order of events never changes (forest-->river-->plains-->desert/second river-->mountain-->freefall-->rapids/present day) but there are special random events that can occur, including everything from unicorns to time travel to pirates, many of which will unlock new wagons.SAWA is really fun, but also difficult. I've only completed it once, and I had to use the invisible wagon, which has a super tiny hitbox.

Visually, the style works.The sound is amazing too,  and I regret not bein able to find a soundtrack.What you're looking at is essential a Rogue Like.   A very fast paced one at that that is completely and utterly unforgiving.  Master the controls,  and get a rythem down for the random events allows you to survive.  So not only do you need technical skill playing, but also the fate of an RNG.Lots of unlockables also means that while you don't get to the end each time,  you might at least pull out a new Wagon,  or discover a differnt event.Finally, price.

Not too filling and kind of unhealthy, but it's cheap and you can eat it while on the way.""Super Amazing Wagon Adventure created by sparsevector back in 2013. In this game, you play as 3 migrants travelling west....And that's where the similarities end. To put it simple, this game is a retro-like side-scroll shooter with randomness and humor that's all around the place. Expect wacky situations to occured when travelling west.- Civil war? Check.- Bank robery? Check.- Zombies? Check.- Battling inner demon? Check.- And many moreEven your migrant's death descriptions are funny. Well, in most cases.One playthrough usually last about approximately 10 minutes (maybe more, maybe less). While some argue that the short duration of each gameplay can hurt the replay value, that's not really the case in the game. There are variety of wagons that can be unlockable during the main story, and because of the randomness, you can't really unlock them during one gameplay. And the way to unlock the said wagon also worthwhile.What else I could say about the game?- Controls are responsive- The sound assets are catchy, and kinda fit with the whole wacky nature of the game.- The system requirements are lowProbably the only thing I dislike about the game are the screen transitions. It's kinda fast sometimes, I can't finish reading the text. Because of the wackiness, I don't really recommend this to people that hate randomness in their games. But if you like unpredictable situations, do get this game. It's cheap, fun, and can be done in a short time, something rare these days (IMO).TL;DR: A quick game that you can play when taking a short break from your activity, and also fun.Also, one last word.Buffalo"

And it's not the kind of game that you have to warm up to either; I can just pick it up, play through an adventure, and leave if need be.Personally, I like unlocking things. Even if I don't put it to frequent use, unlockables are very similar to accomplishments for me, so naturally I never get tired of SAWA. The numerous unlockables aren't just for keeping you engrossed in the game; they make you go for certain events that you may not have chosen otherwise (I'm talking about the rivers here). I personally don't like going into the desert with the snakes, scorpians, and vultures, but when I saw the locked Survival mode, I figured I'd go to try and unlock it. Because of this, I encountered new events that I never would've seen without the motivation to go back to that desert. Now I like alternating between different areas to see what kind of new or unlikely events I can trigger!This isn't intended to be a hardcore game, but there are those kind of challenges for the people that always aim for the gold in video games. You know what kind of challenges I mean, and SAWA has them, namely the Random wagon, where you have to make it 50 days in Shuffle without dying. For those who haven't played Shuffle mode, it's a hard challenge. Take it from me.SAWA is great for gamers of all types: casual, hardcore, completionists, you name it. I definitely recommend this game, even if it's for an hour."

I've heard very good things about this game and honestly, it's all it lives up to be and then some. At first, the game plays out pretty well and there's a few good moments that's genuinely comedic but after playing more than 30 minutes of the game, you begin to actually take the game seriously and find that some parts are unforgiving if not seemingly impossible.I've currently unlocked about 6-8 of the wagons so far but not each without their own pain of doing so. The game becomes reptitive after a while and some of the challenges more frustrating than funny. I can't tell you how many times I've threw out a f-bomb when dying by ninjas in an event I cannot control or trying to navigate a maze with falling boulders and ravenous wolves or running down a river with boulders that you cannot navigate through (or destroy because a lack of a good gun).Over all, the game is enjoyable and something you can sit back and play for 15 minutes at a time but if you plan to play more of it, prepare for a kick in the balls because this game is quickly unforgiving."

It's inexpensive, it's a game you can pick up and play for 10 minutes, but it has plenty of unlockables, divergent events, and so on.Basically each 'level' is dodging enemies or projectiles.  There are also plenty of bosses and minibosses, and each time you play is different.  What makes SAWA different is that the each event is insane, from accidentally jumping into outer space, to taking shrooms and fighting off your inner demons, or my personal favorite, fighting glitches in the game as they attack and try to break the game.There's not much to say, the replayability is great but does run dry and is completely randomized, so there's no way of knowing if you'll ever unlock some of them.

,Not Recommended,250500,16286037,"Posted: 9 June, 2015",all,FirstUtterance,"This is the kind of game that makes me question if I should continue to bother with video games or not. Am I just wasting my time? Are these games that've been hyped to heaven with almost no backlash just bald-faced lies spitting in my face? I have come to this point after wasting so much of my life, throwing myself over 20 hours closer to my death, playing this repetitive, poorly balanced, poorly made-in-general piece of ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. Yes, I despise this game. I have finally come to terms with that conclusion. I tried giving it one more chance after my first (also negative) review that's now deleted, unlocked a few more wagons and modes, but nothing changed for me except the growing hatred for this game, my grown distrust for popular consensus and for sources of game coverage I thought were reliable, and the weariness this has brought upon my life in general. I really, really hate this game.OK to start: what it looks like: an absurdist, tongue-in-cheek parody of Oregon Trail (obviously), like the video game equivalent of a Mel Brooks or an old Zucker/Abrahams movie. And that description is accurate to some extent. This is a game full of zany, random occurrences, ridiculous humor, and gameplay that, to put it one way, bears little resemblance to the original Oregon Trail. This is all just window dressing though. Strip it aside and what you have instead is a really awful vertical shmup mixed in with awful twin-stick shooter segments with a factor of randomization added to try to give it variation but they bungled it up so badly that it makes already badly done mechanics more frustrating.If there is a singular goal in this game, it's to unlock all the wagons, since doing so requires accomplishing pretty much every possible task in the game. One wagon requires you not only unlock all five levels in survival mode, but get three full stars in all of them (which means surviving three or more minutes), another requires unlocking ""shuffle mode"" where you must survive as many randomly ordered scenes from the main game in a row (to get the wagon you need to survive 50), and unlocking the final wagon means completing the main adventure with ALL the wagons. Most of the wagons are unlocked by stumbling upon and surviving random scenarios, some rarer than others, in the game.The main adventure allows you to ride a wagon with three attendants, which you can customize to some degree by gender, hair style, hair color, manner and color of dress, skin color, eyes, and facial hair (reserved for the men only). This is probably the most fun part of the game, not that it's necessarily interesting in itself, even if it is amusing, but because it's the one and only thing in this game that doesn't cause immense suffering. Then you pick your wagon which you only have one to start with and, if I'm being perfectly honest, is probably better than the majority of wagons I've tried so far. It sucks, but it sucks less so than some of the other crap you get. Now the concepts for the wagons sound fun but actually playing with them? No. The magic wagon has probably the worst default weapon of everything in the game, firing spread ""magic"" shots in wide angles, too wide actually, and disintegrates things when it kill them meaning you can't collect precious animal hides with it (better get a power-up!), and it fires slowly at that. The invisible wagon starts you off with 1 health for everyone, no joke, as a compromise for how small and easily maneuverable it is. If you survive the first areas and can grab full health for everyone it's great, otherwise, good luck. The space shuttle starts you all off with TWO health, has an even larger hit box than the other wagons (which are too big as it is, making the NES Silver Surfer's seem like a pixel by comparison), has only the same regular attack as the main wagon, and is faster, meaning, harder to control when you're faced by a barrage of enemies and herds of buffalo who will most assuredly kill you much faster. I could go on about how annoying and unfun some other wagons are but really it's the game itself that's out to get you more than the crappiness of your wagons (though that doesn't help).OK like I said the game is randomized, but not to the extent a roguelike or even some roguelites would take it. It's more like a Tower of Guns roguelite where there is a small amount of randomization but with mostly clear-cut, set paths, level designs and so forth, the difference being that Tower of Guns was actually not a terrible game (I gave up on some of its frustrating challenges eventually but for the most part had a good time with it). The game begins the same way every single time - you kill animals for fur, run into some bandits, seek either wild berries (or if the game wants to ♥♥♥♥ you over, shrooms, though surviving that once does unlock a wagon - but after that, it grows tiresome), then you come to a river crossing, where you can either jump or ford it. Most of the wagons are too slow, clunky and big to bother fording, so I always jumped (which sometimes landed me in the river anyway, getting me hit by boulders coming downriver). There is one set of boulders where you must wait for them to come down, with a space opening up to go through but I swear unless you have a fast-moving wagon this is literally impossible to get through without getting hit. And it goes on and on and on. The game itself is not that long, but you will be assuredly killed repeatedly due to the crappiness of the mechanics and the random events which will screw you over big time.Sometimes the game asks if you want to investigate something, like distant gunfire (which is either a bank or train robbery), but a lot of times it forces you into situations that you don't want to go into. Like, no, I don't want to save the injured falcon or get the poison gun for the billionth time, especially if I'm at the brink of death and have a perfectly capable gun already at my disposal. But it will anyway and you have no choice but to go along with it. Some situations you may as well quit your game since you will get bent if you encounter them. Like having to travel to a distant trader for a new wheel with the falcon with coyotes all over you. These segments are long and the falcon really sucks at taking down large numbers of fast-moving enemies at once. Then you die and you must repeat the process with one of the other surviving characters and you die again. And if you're forced to meet a woman in a red dress and she turns into a bandit, just... quit right there. After that you will be assaulted by bandits you have no chance of winning against. Oh, and buffalo. I don't know how you're supposed to survive the large herds of buffalo with a large wagon without a decent weapon, and if your characters (idiotically) decide they're ""bored"" and speed through the herd, you're dead, and frankly they deserve it for being so goddamn stupid as to speed through buffalo to be trampled to death by them and your poorly handled vehicle. Oh yeah there are ""twin stick"" segments where you might be alone on foot and fight enemies without your wagon or compadres. Your hitbox is more reasonable, but movement never felt ""right"" nor did the mouse aiming. There are too many fast-moving, tiny enemies hard to hit with your puny weapons with you being too slow to outrun them and eventually you'll be circled and killed. That's actually more a complaint of the survival mode than of the main game but it can happen.But no matter where you die, whether by buffalo, by wolves on a mountain, or river boulders, the game always feels so inanely repetitive. You will encounter every scenario, of which there are very few, so many times trying to complete the game with one of your many crappy wagons and failing that it becomes a mentally numbing experience. I don't want to hunt more wildlife, bandits, berries, or choose to cross or ford rivers ever again. This is sheer endurance, not fun."

It's a really great 2D side-scrolling, shooter spoof of Oregon Trail. Essentially, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a series of fast-paced, wacky, and (mostly) random sequences.There's three characters on the wagon that you can name and customize to a small degree. This is great if you decide to name and model them after people who are watching you play the game, as there's no telling what craziness will happen on their journey. The game is short, but it's challenging... something modern games are sorely lacking. However, the replayability is very high, because you will experience many different sequences each time you play the game. You can also unlock survival modes and several different wagons with unique perks.sparsevector nailed every single thing that he wanted to accomplish with this game. It does an excellent job of harkening back to old computer and Atari 2600 games (love the Motion Blurring and CRT Monitor effects).

He had loved her ever since they sat around a campfire and talked about feelings to regain health. He found a tactical carpet bombing and called it in saying ""See you all in hell."" under his breath. But, somehow he and LD had survived, they looked around them, blood and horns everywhere...to Sgt.Bigdick it was beautiful revenge, but to LD it seemed as though Sgt. had gone mad. They were on their merry way when suddenly, bandits. LD picked up a bow and was able to shoot a few before he ran out of arrows. Sgt.Bigdick pulls out his trusty pistol that never runs out of ammo for some reason, but now was not the time to question it. He was able to pick off 5 bandits before a machine gun bandit came in and shot Sgt.Bigdick within an inch of his life, the group found a rocket launcher aimed and blew up the machine gun bandit. The party comes across a river, Sgt.Bigdick obviously suffering from blood loss has the idea to jump it before fading out of consciousness. LD had the significantly better idea to ford the river, at first all was fine then...the boulders...so many boulders. Sgt. woke up just in time to be crushed by a boulder. LD was in tears as he finally made it across the river. Just as he thought nothing could be worse than losing his superior officer...a herd of buffalo appear. LD finds a flamethrower and roasts all of the buffalo without sustaining a scratch. But then, BUFFALO...""no""LD whispers...BUFFALO...BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO. LD goes down in a blaze of glory fighting till he couldn't bear to go on at one health left he sees an on-coming buffalo, this was it, this was the end.

Granted, this is not some Earth-shattering monument of technical achievement or anything.  But for what it is, it is very fun and will provide you with hours of amusement.  For an idea of what the game itself is like, imagine Oregon Trail meets Galaga as written by Tim & Eric and directed by Mel Brooks (because that totally doesn't sound like some kind of monster).  The gameplay itself is smooth, fun, and well-varied.  Most of the things that you come across are pretty much random events (there is some overall structure; i.e. you generally pass through most of the same 'zones' in the same order, however what those 'zones' contain tends to be randomized), and there are some very interesting (and amusing) random events.  Controls are simple and responsive and it's controller-compatible, so you've got options there.  There are also a bunch of unlockables to keep you engaged for a while, including different modes of play (sadly, however, no multiplayer).Overall, this game is a really great deal if you like retro-styled side-scrolling shooter games with a heavy helping of humor.

The challenges are fun, and the randomization of events and effects makes several dozen playthroughs worth the time.It's fun, funny, and has a sense of silly wonder."

You'll encounter Unicorns, Strange Space Machines, Pirates, and even Machine-Gun weilding Bandits! This game has everything! However the only thing I would like changed is how relationships can occur. Sometimes on your journey a party member will fall in love with another party member. I like this feature as it adds an extra layer to the randomness of this game. My only complaint with this is that you can't disable same-gender couples. On one of my journeys one of my party members (He was a guy and my best friend IRL) fell in love with my character (Who was also a guy). This didn't change too much but I was annoyed that I couldn't disable it. Other than that this is an amazing game set at an amazing price and you should try it out!"

I played this game for over 12 hours and only beat it a couple of times, but it's so fun you won't even care about losing. With lots of different wagons to unlock and a semi-random progression, which is partially influenced by the player's choices, and the number of times you'll just lose, this game has a pretty high replay value.  At a price of $2.99, you'll never get so much for so little elsewhere. BUY THIS GAME."

Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is basically a shoot 'em up / bullet hell type of game that starts very slowly and that adds more and more and more elements to the mix until you can't take it, putting you in situations where you must dodge rabid bears while shooting at bandits while steering your wagon through flaming tumbleweeds. The gameplay is very simple, but the developers really nailed the difficulty right, which forces you to constantly stay on your toes and expect the worst possible outcome. Random elements and choices leading to several possible outcomes ensure a different playthrough almost everytime you try to clear the game and there are several fun unlockables for completionists.Come for the price tag, stay for the hilarity, and make sure all your friends get to try it as you watch."

,Recommended,250500,33737264,Posted: 22 July,all,nujumkey,"A very fast paced parody of Organ trail that takes the American setting and makes it ... sillier? The game is side scrolling shooter with filled with permadeath and randomly generated events. It's also my favorite type of randomness, the controlled type of randomness where in every stage of the game you have multiple possibilities of events that can come up. This means you can get rng screwed, but the runs don't take very long so it's not a big deal. It's good at giving you new stuff to play with, there are a ton of wagons and weapons in the game you can unlock by completing the more difficult events. I've not actually beaten the game yet, it's pretty challanging to stay alive past all the stuff the game throws at you, but that's also why the game is fun. Don't expect Organ trail, it's really far from that sort fo game but still fun in it's own right (especially when it's relatively cheap)."
