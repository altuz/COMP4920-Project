We can now move on to bigger and better things), and the ending (HUGE SPOILER INCOMING. Ok, not really...) stands in stark contrast to the rest of this short lived, yet engaging and compassionate experience, it will somehow, through its nonexistent 5 minute gameplay, transform you into a fragile, helpless being, futilely trying to survive in a harsh, yet mysteriously beautiful world.It's the poetry of pixels."

(+1 perfect game!)The music in this game was very nice. I'm honestly not sure what was happening until the end, but even then it made very little sense. Afterkilling yourself, you are presented with a white screen in which you can type. Now, this made no sense, but after sending your message, you get to see stars, and if you mouse over the individual stars you can see the messages other players have typed in.Now, I don't understand the practicality of this feature, but its interesting nonetheless.The graphics are decent and the game ran quite well on my low end laptop. A big thing for me is atmosphere and music, and this game did great with executing that.A lot of this game made no sense, and it was very short, but I recommend playing and it is an interesting experience.8.7/10"

I did get caught in a spider web, but I only saw one and I didn't see the spider before I quickly broke out of it. The music did make me stop and be more alert of the game and what was happening, but I quickly realised that nothing was going to happen. some music, a little different backround and that was it. The end was interesting to me, but once I discovered it, the game was just over. White screen, and now I get to type something? I press enter and you get a chance to restart the game. Overall, if you like or want a quiet mind, go ahead and play it. But if you like chaos and entertainment more, don't get this game"
