,Recommended,250620,10278622,"Posted: 29 May, 2014",all,Spirit,"Let me express something before we get into this: I am a pansy. I have yet to completely finish the first Amnesia. I have a backlog of horror games (including some point n' clicks) that grows every day. Because I have a problem. I LOVE horror games... but like an ice cream enthusiast who happens to also be lactose intolerant, horror games do not love me. So there you have it; that's the score.Now that being said, I'm going to power through this one to completion. Know why? Because it's that good. Oh man is this game good. It is a testament to why horror games are so great... and why even now, in a market saturated with action horrors and tired old tropes, you'll still find an ""Among the Sleep."" This game is horrifying. Care to know why? What's the biggest issue plaguing the horror genre? That's right: termites. And player empowerment. Sometimes I'm a big, brave guy lugging around a shotgun. Sometimes I'm running around with a camera. Sometimes I might as well be stark naked. But I always find myself on equal ground with the baddies. Sure they're menacing, but I'm faster. And smarter. And sometimes more heavily armed. And suddenly we're not playing a horror game anymore. So how do we remove player empowerment, a hypothetical developer might muse? How do we make the player feel like a babe lost in the woods?  We turn them into a ♥♥♥♥ing babe, right down to the wobbles and coos and imaginary friends.And when I tell you that makes this game immersive and terrifying, I'm not kidding. When you pause the screen you cover your little eyes. When you move at all, AT ALL, you make adorable little sounds of struggle. And when you, the player, gaze into that mother♥♥♥♥ing abyss, that sucker stares right back. Every shadow hides a menace, every sound betrays a would-be threat. Everything is so big and intimidating. The whole environment just mocks you as you explore it semi-impotently. Because you're a baby. A smart baby, yes. But a baby. And that big, scary world is out to get you.I'm not remotely done with this game. I know I have a ways to go. I'm already freaked out - in a good way! If you have a passing interest in horror, you won't be disappointed. Now I'm going to go clean the boom-boom out of my pants and press onward."

BUT... what do you say about a game you progress through by murdering mobs of faceless mooks? That game mechanic goes beyond ""it's been done"" to the point of ""why are we still doing this?""Among the Sleep is different. Its protagonist is non-gendered skillfully enough that I could easily assume it was a he... but a female player could just as easily assume it was a she, and neither of us would find anything ""weird"" about that.  And I didn't beat up, much less kill, a single other character in the entire game... even though it was a horror game, and a legitimately scary one.  And even though in the reveal at the end of the game I was presented with more than sufficient reason to harbor ill-will toward the antagonist... the natural progression of the game didn't force me to, but allowed me to /discover/ a touching, compassionate gesture instead.  That, again, felt perfectly natural when it happened.Make no mistake, this is a horror game, it is a creepy one, and it has some truly scary moments in it. It is captivating, it is not a light casual romp. And yet... it breaks completely free of the ""kill mooks to progress"" mold without feeling in any way forced. Do yourself a favor: set three to four hours aside and Play. This. Game."
,Recommended,250620,18190223,"Posted: 25 September, 2015",all,JacquesLeSauve,"I'm so ashamed of myself. I can't believe I had this game in my library for close to a year and ignored it for all that time. I was so in the mood for shooters or some puzzle games that everything else was pushed to the side. But one day I was in the mood for something where I could traverse at ankle height and defecate myself involuntarily, and, boy, am I glad I found this little gem to scratch that particular itch.This is going to be a slightly awkward one to write about because half the fun of the game is not knowing exactly what it is then discovering it as you go along, most of which is best left unsaid. What I can say about it, though, is it's predominantly a psychological horror played through the eyes of a small boy on his second birthday as you crawl your way through stages related to his life in search of his missing mother along with the aid of his tiny teddy bear friend, occasionally toddling around on your hind legs like a wee little Rory Calhoun. It sounds like it could be gimmicky or a million miles away from anything that would typically be relevant to your interests, but believe me, there's so much more beneath that unassuming surface.By doing something as small as lowering the player's view to ground level, there's instantly a very fresh and unique feel to the game. Add to that the fact you're playing as a baby trying to navigate an adult world where a simple everyday object now becomes a sizable hurdle, and you've got something even more captivating. But then throw it all inside a horror game and you've got the perfect recipe for something really special. All of that could have been enough by itself, but they took it even further and went to great lengths conveying the world as filtered through the barely developed mind of an infant.It's incredibly easy to take for granted, and I never really thought about it myself 'til now, but this game really makes you think about and appreciate what it must be like to inhabit the world as someone who's practically a stranger to it, and how it does that is a stroke of genius, as everything that's unfamiliar becomes alien and terrifying. A crash of lightning feels like an earthquake, or a household appliance could be an evil monster waiting to get us should we disturb it, even words on labels or books are gibberish symbols since we don't understand how to read them. You can even hug your teddy bear at times to make you ""feel safe"", ""safe"" in this case being to illuminate the path immediately ahead of you. The way it plays with your perceptions and interpretations of everything around you and feeds you back distortions of the child's own fragmented memories is a master stroke of design and execution that succeeds from the start right through to the increasingly dark end.That end won't be too far for most people, maybe between two-and-a-half and three hours of play, and could easily be done in a single sitting (which I'd recommend). And while the length didn't bother me (if anything, it probably would have suffered were it drawn out any longer), the cost certainly would, and had I paid full price I would have been a little irked by it, given that it has little to no replay value beyond that time. But otherwise, I can't praise this highly enough. There's so much more I want to say about it, but unfortunately I can't without spoiling it, and I wouldn't want to rob any player of both the wonder and horror that awaits them here. So turn off the lights, turn up your headphones, and immerse yourself in the marvel that awaits in Among the Sleep."

,Recommended,250620,13674142,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"Among the Sleep is a game of perspective and confusion, seen through the eyes of a toddler in a world vastly larger and more terrifying.Its appeal is largely wrapped in this unusual viewpoint, but it's so novel and well executed that it's a strong enough hook to pivot a game around that if shown any other way would likely fall entirely flat. Seeing the dark and often surreal world around you from barely a few feet off the ground, your awkward steps making a quick escape unlikely as you stumble and fall in an attempt to run from the nightmares that haunt you, is frightening and enthralling. The vulnerability felt through playing as such a small character is immense, and had me scurrying under chairs and attempting to pry open cabinets as my only defense was to hide where the monsters pursuing me wouldn't think to look.It's hard to deny that beyond making your way from each twisted environment to the next there's very little interactivity to be found in Among the Sleep, but in most cases this works in the games favor and makes sense given a toddler's limited motor skills. There aren't involved puzzles or elaborate mechanics to deal with, it's simply you and your teddy bear trying to find your mother before the horrors around you find you first, and this simplicity allowed me to fully embody my role in this world that was intentionally beyond my comprehension. Much of the narrative is told nonverbally through the environment, with themes of alcoholism, domestic abuse, and child abandonment dripping out of bits and pieces of the world as they painted an exceptionally bleak picture in an already oppressively eerie game.Among the Sleep isn't without its flaws; there are moments when its gameplay becomes too shallow even for how deliberately designed it is to be that way, the voice acting ranges from acceptable to weird, and many of the textures can be shockingly muddy. But what it's trying to be, and in most ways entirely succeeds, is something that will stick with me long after the credits finish and I sit in the dark hoping the child I'd been playing as finds better days to come.You can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

The beginning was somewhat tense and could have developed into something truely frightening, but  in the end became quite pedestrain.The over naraitive was interesting with subtle hints along the way to reveal the climax, and whilst it was strong it didn't really add to the experience.Most damning is its very short length, even if you take the time to explore and lack of replay value.Overall a decent game, but falls short of expecations and its potential."

With great atmosphere and Heart-Pounding moments, you always are wanting to look behind you to see if you are being chased. I think this is possibly more scary than Amnesia.

You work your way through progressively harder and longer puzzles to find your mother who has gone missing.I really enjoyed the atmosphere set by the lighting and sound in Among the Sleep. It is on par with Amnesia in that sense. Although it's not as scary as Amnesia, there are still times where it had me pausing the game for me to catch my breath because I was wetting myself.For some reason I couldn't get my controller to work with this game, which is a shame since it is the perfect game to use with a controller, but there isn't anything wrong with mouse and keyboard controls, ever.I'd say wait for this game to go on sale before you pick it up, it's quite short and the £14,99 is a bit much for a game which is only about three hours long."

Your mom givse you a teddy bear, but then something happens that cause her to get freaked out and puts you in your room while I suppose she is dealing with it. You and your now animate teddy go on a little adventure at which point your mom realizes you got out of your playpen and puts you to bed for the night. You hear somethign and start to wake up. Your teddy is taken from you and your crib knocked over, which is where the real adventure begins.This is a horror game as seen through the eyes of a two year old, and it brilliantly handles this through creepy sights and sounds and some ambiguous monster that starts to hunt for you as the story progresses.There are a couple times where you will jump a little, but it isnt really a scary game per se. It is however creepy, and the subject matter is quite dark and depressing. The end is both sad and hopeful all at once.I will say without giving anythign away that this topic will be relevant and quite poignant for a lot of people, and it may even be the sort of game that brings real tears to you depending on your own set of circumstances growing up. While I didnt experience the things that happen in this game, I can appreciate how much this might affect some people.Outside of that, the adventure is filled with mystery and awe.I think this was a very well made game that also handled a sensitive topic quite well and did an amazing job of bringing the world as seen through two year old eyes to life perfectly.This one is a 10/10 for sure."

Last year, I bought this game but never got round to playing it. Today, I finally sat with the little boy who is now 4 and we completed it in one sitting. We had a good laugh, and at one point the little one got quite a jump and he farted and he was pretty proud of it. The puzzles were good. The atmosphere was fanstastic. The ending was brilliant. Today I had a good time playing with my son on a game that was not mindless mining for crap to make crap. We did not have to mash buttons or endlessly press X to build crap on Lego Whatever.

Once the comforting companion has been tracked down, the two unlikely heroes have to make their way through their nightmarishly distorted home, only to find themselves trapped in surreal dreamscapes, which can only be escaped by unlocking suppressed memories. Soon enough, very real horrors start seeping into this fairy tale world of the subconcious. ""Among the Sleep"" truly is a masterpiece of interactive storytelling.

Unfortunately, what we have is a muddled, dark, linear and very short game with only the faintest wisps of a story.  It also features some of the most nausea inducing camera-work I have seen in a long while, and a very tight FOV with no adjustment did not help.  The limited checkpoint save system is also an annoyance.   The majority of the game involves walking through a random hodge-podge of closets, basements, and dream-scape forests, linearly collecting objects to open the ""gates"" to move to the next section.  Then the game is over.  For something that needed to have a compelling and interesting story, Among the Sleep just fell flat.  Not recomended."
,Recommended,250620,26065947,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,Niowyn,"This game is one of my favorite all time games. The last horror game that I absolutely loved was Amnesia the Dark Descent and after that I thought no horror game would ever be as good, until they came up with this and many people refered it as Amnesia from the point of view of a baby.Now if you think you were absolutely defendless in Amnesia, you can guess that it gets even worse because, how what can possibly a baby do against the things that lurk in the shadows except from hiding in places he can only access? You won't be completely alone on the baby's adventure though, they were kind enough to give you a teddy bear companion that could talk to you and lights up when you hug him. Which is a very recomforting item in the middle of a very messed up baby's world.What I liked the most is that, since the protagonist is still a baby well the way they see the world is so much different of what it is. And also since some parts of the game is going through the memories, well it's no secret that human process memory very different before the age of 3, so the vision of those memories is a pretty disorted world from what it actually is, making the experience even scarier for the player.Since the begining I had a pretty good idea of what was going on, nevertheless that made me constantly worry even more about the baby and feel powerless at the idea. Even though my suspicious were true it still managed to give me a shock in the ending, because the game is truly immersive. I'd try to play in one sitting for better experience, and also because unfortunately I've heard people complainig that game files got somehow deleted after a while of not playing (I don't know if this has been fixed in a patch though, since it's been a while since I heard those complaints).So to wrap this up, if you want a unique and genuine horror experience, it's worth checking this title out, it can get spooky without the need of cheap jumpscares, it has stealth elements, a loyal companion and an eerie environment.Update as Nov 2016:Saving system may still mess up somehow, so take my advice to beat it in one sitting or ASAP."

,Recommended,250620,16548527,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,CorvusCorax,"Among the Sleep is a cleverly written survival horror game developed by Norwegians. It is a unique little game in the sense that the protagonist is a two-year-old little boy who's aided by his Teddy bear in order to go through various horrors that are lurking in their house.The story begins with a birthday celebration that reveals Teddy to be the gift. However, he is taken from the boy and in chapter 1 we need to retrieve him quickly only to realise that the real protection from the dark can only be offered by mom. The journey then continues to find mom and along the way we encounter some monsters and cleverly thought out puzzles.The game has a great atmosphere and for full immersion a headset is required - similarly to the Amnesia games. The Unity engine does its job properly and the visuals look great. The only downside is the game's short story: it can be completed in a mere 2 hours including its DLC content which is a kind of prologue and is meant to be played after the story is done.Overall, Among the Sleep is a good game that I can recommend mainly to the fans of the genre. Hopefully, the guys at Krillbite Studios will develop a - much longer - sequel or another game with similar level of quality.UPDATE: The latest update (version number 2) introduces some new achievements (all related to collectibles) along with some nice graphics enhancements thanks to the new version of the Unity engine."

Unless you're one of the ""this game it too short"" brigade, in which case you probably should have learned by now not to buy these kinda games, especially at full-price.It's slow to build, and a LOOOOONG time before you encounter any true ""danger"" within the game. But when that moment comes in which you realise that, yes, the spooky creatures you've been safely spotting from afar ARE actually interested in moving in for a closer look, it's every bit as legitimately pants-browning as the best horror games you've ever played.What's more, the ""child-like"" perspective, while not fully reinventing the wheel, does put quite a different spin on well-worn first-person adventure gaming themes. For example, where other games would require your character to push a crate up against a wall in order to access a high vent, in this one your toddler has to pull a kitchen chair up just to reach a regular-height surburban door handle! Everything feels quite dauntingly HUGE to our diminutive hero, making it feel not unlike Alice trapped in a nightmare Wonderland (one in which she never managed to find the antidote to the shrinking potion)!It's super-spooky, super-imaginative, has amazingly atmospheric sound design, and your best friend/sole ally is a talking teddy-bear! So what are you waiting for? Unless the answer is ""a better computer"", you really don't have an excuse...unless you're a complete wuss, of course.

Their first being The Plan, which was a 'preview' of their first shot at developing with the Unity engine... and quite frankly changed my view of what defines a good game in a matter of 2 minutes time.It seems that this small group of developers has a knack of thinking outside of the box. Again using the Unity engine, Among the Sleep puts you in the unique position of viewing the world through the eyes of a two year old. Never before has a lovable protagonist been so helpless. Using this gameplay method in a horror game is a stroke of genious, since you have no way of defending yourself against unknown evils. It really adds to the feeling of helplessness. Periodic jumpscares plus extraordinary psychologically tense background noise creates an unnerving edge-of-your seat venture.This game is not without its flaws.

Stuff happens.My only complaint with this game is that it was far too short. And I say that because of how much I enjoyed the game. It's sort of like when your favorite TV show decides to end when it's still perfect and everyone loves it.

For exmaple, hugging your teddy bear makes you feel better, and also provides a little bit of light to see in dark areas.  There's a sequence toward the end that really made me feel like a toddler who's just knocked something over and knows he's in trouble for it.  This is not the scariest game I've ever played, at least not until I reached the end and understood what was actually going on.If you like horror games but don't want something too intense, or if you think maybe games can be art without having to be boring, this is well worth your time."

I got my game on sale awhile back but the price is 15 bucks. For a game that is 15 bucks i give the graphics an average rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars. I seen better graphics on cheaper games but the game is meh on that catagory. For the story line i give it 4 out of 5 stars. Not many people make games with a storyline like this which makes it good. Story line is sad but truth that goes on in the world today. Seeing life as a two year old and how he see abuse. The achievments are kinda tricky to get.

So bare that in mind when looking at the price.The graphics are really nice and well done.The sounds are really great, spot on and creepy.The controls are so easy and simple to get used too, you really cannot complain.The game contains some really nice features, like the ability to open and close doors, pick stuff up, carry the teddy, crawl around and underneath stuff, and even look at the floor when walking and see the toddlers stomach and hands move.  It really has some nice features added to the game.The game is also really scary on many parts.  I streamed my content with this game and enjoyed all 2 hours of this game before completing.There are some really great scary parts, which you really do not expect.  I thought Outlast was the scariest game ever played and I am now having doubts and thinking this, because I am a 26year old grown man and this game made me jump and scream like a girl on some really silly but odd parts.I even got jumped at coats on a coat rack because the shape and style looked like a ghost or monster or whatever you want to call it.  So the game has that fear factor and good fun for this.Is the game worth the £13.49 -10% right now as I write this review or the full £14.99 price after the promotion.... Erm to me I think no!I brought this game hoping for so much more game time and play, to find I completed it in under 2hours and it has no real replay value, is like a massive shock.Really, wait for a deal on this game to buy, and I know it is not really supporting the developers but then we could say, well do not charge overprice for a 2hours extended demo game.I played the demo and it scared me and thought wow, I will buy.  I brought it the moment it hit the store, installed and thought I have time to play some before I go out so I played 2hours and was complete and really annoyed and let down.£14.99 + 2hours = Annoyed.The price being asked is not worth the time it needs.

Even with the free DLC extra chapter, its short... like under 4 hours short. There is not a ton of replay value unless you get drawn into the story and want to go back to see little meta-clues and child-drawings you missed. The couple of graphical glitches, overlapping lighting through doors, odd seeing through objects at odd angles... not bad honestly, and definitely not game-breaking.The good: this is a rather well told dark story, and seeing it explored through the body of a 2-yr old child is a very unique approach to telling it. Your adult-brain logic being used to guide the character through the puzzles and tale aside, they've done quite a good job of making you feel like you're interacting through a toddler. As a small child you are clumsy, slow, very poorly armed and armored against the shadows that crawl along the walls and roar out through the dark... your only defense is to hide and find comfort in the warmth in your teddybear guide and traveling companion.There are a few jumpscares, but absolutely no gore... this game uses nothing but unease, shadows and noises, the surreality of childhood nightmares and exagerations, and the inherent helplessness of your character as the basis for it's horror. A significant part of the entire storyline involves some well written emotional manipulation; if you play these kinds of games in any sort of emersive mind-set (or you're just kinda over-emotional like I can be), you will get a far greater experience from this game. You'll be motivated to help the child through this journey, feel afraid of the creepiness of this world, and seeing the tale through the end will feel rather moving in bad and good ways... potentially triggery ways, depending on your own childhood...If you don't do emersive gaming, if you dont allow yourself to play these kinds of games as if you were nervous about the surroundings, if you just plow through these kinds of hide-from-the-monster horror games... this will be a short game with not much meat on it, and you will likely feel more dissapointed than profound.Recommended to purchase on sale.

The puzzles are easy and I usually prefer them to be harder, but they are perfect for this game and don't pull you out of the story like some of the more frustrating ones in other games do.I've been obsessed with all things horror since I was a kid, so it generally takes a lot to creep me out, but this game did. I know a lot of folks will disagree, but for me this was probably the creepiest game I've ever played. I think a big part of that is the shadow creatures you encounter, a lot of horror games (and movies) often lose that creepy atmosphere for me once the monster is revealed because I often find them too cheesy, but this game really plays on the fear of the unknown in that and many other ways.This game also did an amazing job of making me feel like I was the character, which is not easy since you play as a 2 year old. The atmosphere it creates had me on edge the whole time, so I was hiding under every bed and thinking just about everything was the legs or feet of a creature while I was under there. On top of this you crawl faster than you walk, you have to drag and climb on objects to reach door handles, hugging your teddy bear companion provides a light source, etc.A must play for anyone into atmospheric horror in my opinion. 10/10 and I really hope Krillbite will expand on this game further and/or release more survival horror in the future."

The ""story,"" foreshadowing, unique gameplay, atmosphere and clever level design are all presented well in this game.  The only downside is the length, even though it feels appropriate given the lack of gameplay mechanics the  devs had to work with.The cleverness to the scare tactics was genius.  Just like when I was a kid, it was the unknown that scared me the most.  So much of this game works on the player's imagination instead of cheap jump-scares.  In a lot of horror games, it is common to start predicting the scary section which can often soften the blow.  Not in this game.  The ambiance is done  well enough that the anticipation of a predictable scare actually makes it worse.  Kind of like being in a dream and knowing that it's going bad.They did such a good job with the sound effects.  The bumps, creaks, groans, smashes, screams and cries all drive the unsettled nerves home.The devs also did an excellent job making you feel as helpless as a two year old child.  The toddler can crawl faster than walk, he will fall over if he sprints for more than a short distance, his light source is a teddy-bear that lights up when hugged, water is a nono, everything seems much larger and daunting, he can't reach doorknobs without something to climb on, and his lack of fine motor skills makes the clunkyness of ""click and hold"" mouse interactions feel right.The foreshadowing is great.  A lot of the clues you get to the story are in the environment or depicted as a two-year-old's scribbled drawing.Though the  length is short but feels accurate for the game, it is hard to say that a 3-4 hour game with little to no replay value  should be $20.  The reason why I say that it has  no replay value is the fact that the game relies so heavily on the unknown and the imagination for the fear to work, that there will be nothing worth seeing again given that the gameplay is a little ""slow""If you really like horror games,  you probably already own this game, but if you don't, then you need to go get it.

Though with the campaign being so short, catching it on sale would be recommended:P Great game though! Definitely worth a playthrough or two simply from the imaginative perspective."

,Recommended,250620,31084382,Posted: 11 April,all,AzoreanEve,"I found this to be an OK game. Concept of being a toddler was new and interesting. The rest was mostly old news. The scare factor comes mostly from 2 things for most of the game: loud random bg noise, giving the impression you are not alone; and scripted jumpscares. While I thoroughly enjoyed the 1st factor, the 2nd one became boring really fast, to the point where I wouldn’t feel threatened at all. The addition of enemies (which felt mostly scripted too) solved that issue in a way, at least for me.First off: SAVING MECHANICS LIE TO YOU. You see all those dandy “saving” notifications in the bottom right corner? Yes, they are saving checkpoints. For when you *die*. If you close the game mid chapter and reload, you’re forced to repeat the whole chapter. It isn’t fun, especially on longer chapters where you might want to take a break, and where the checkpoint system makes it look like you’ll be dropped where you left off.Graphics were ok. Some strange clipping if you actually pay attention but nothing too major. You can use the demo to check them for yourself, I barely noticed a difference.NPCs push you out of the way (which is awkward when the main NPC is so small). Detection for the “climb up” command is really awkward in the last chapter where you have to walk into slightly higher places, not tall enough to be climbable, but I was unable to simply walk towards the 5cm higher place and get on it. That whole chapter had weird collision to think of it. I couldn’t get under furniture that I could get under in previous chapters.Sound was nice and scary. A bit overdone, sometimes?There wasn’t much to the story but then again you’re a toddler, your life isn’t expected to be super complicated anyway. It made sense in the end, wasn’t terrible or anything, but also isn’t going to stick with me.Overall it was interesting. Not one of my favourite games, probably won’t go back to it after getting the achievements. Would still recommend checking out."

You have the abilities as of a small child, which hold you back at doing things like you would in most horror games.Which makes this game all the more realistic.Though I did encounter a few problems, which I shall list:- When the ""infinte"" drawer goes through the first hole, it hits the box and then gets stuck inside the wall. Making it so it can't move. (Which has been fixed now. Thankfully! ^.^ )- When I tried to go back to another chapter, the game would crash and I would have to keep trying until It did it without problems.- The game sometimes froze in the menu.

,Recommended,250620,21376947,"Posted: 21 February, 2016",all,EthanCrambo,"This review contains a couple of mere spoilers.Among the Sleep has a very impressive affect on the player. It shows the great idea that only a genius could think of - using the perspective of a baby. Throughout this baby perspective, we can clearly notice that the baby has worries over many things like their mother's scream. At the beginning of the game, the character's mother goes to answer the door that had just had the doorbell ring. The mother then screams which queues the music and visual effects to give a dramatic effect. This happens to show that the baby feels stressed and panicked as though the mother is giving a distress call - an in-danger tone. I find this is a very creative idea and the creator really understands how emotion is built up in a game.After seeing the monster, I have a slight lust of disappointment, for as soon as a monster is shown in a game, that ruins the horror element of a build up. No studios are able to create a monster that is more horrifying that what we, as consumers, create in our head from mysterious build-ups, such as lighting effects and creaky floorboards. As soon as a monster is shown in a game, it automatically drops some tension and makes the player less scared of the monster. This game has lost the horrific momentum by showing the monster, and the monster doesn't look very scary, but I guess there are limits as to how scary you can make a monster look. And to be quite straight... what is a monster? A monster is a horrific creature or person that is created IN OUT HEADS by dramatic effects and noises. Making a monster be shown in a game really doesn't make it a monster anymore.The teddy bear's voice acting and sounds are very good. The sound effects successfully create tension and the teddy bear successfully sounds like aPaedophile- I mean a nice friend.  In addition, the animations of movement in the game are very smooth, however are a little slow and... the opposite of slick. Whatever that word is.As far as I can judge on the game mechanics, they are quite simple and not all that amazing. Animations for the things the character uses are very simple and could be improved through more time in development.I do believe this game has a really good story line, really good twists and successfully shows the in-depth perspective of a baby in every-day situations. Among the Sleep shows a definite prime example of what a baby would think about as they go to sleep on a dark, windy night. It shows how the baby is petrified and shows how simple things are over-exaggerated in the baby's mind, such as a wardrobe.Overall, I think this game really is worth the play and if you don't play this game, you'd be missing out on a lot of interesting perspective."

You get a few shock scares, but all in all it's a puzzle game with a dark setting. The terror vibe wears out about 30 mins in and never comes back. I'll admit that the idea of the main character being a 2-year old with their teddy interested me enough to buy the game and although I enjoyed some parts, I regret buying Among the Sleep.One play-through is only between 2-3 hours; waaay too short for the price. The graphics lag a bit in certain areas but it's not too bad. The redeeming factor of this game are the visuals. Very well-done, except for the mom's face. Sounds are kind of repetitive, but nothing to get real mad about.What I did get mad about was the fact that I paid $20 for a 3 hour game that doesn't get you on the edge of your seat. I was disappointed with this title, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. How sad :(------[SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT]-----The play time is about 2-3 hours depending on how much you run/walk. Initially it's more intuitive to walk than run because you don't know what the game is all about. After about 30 minutes you realize there's no real backlash to being caught by the monster and you run through everything. This is where the game lost me.First of all, it reveal what the monster looks like waaaay too early. In fact, they shouldn't have ever done that considering the short play time. after it's revealed you lose all sense of this game being the least bit frightening. Aside from a few instances where you actually have to hide from the monster to avoid the harsh penalty [sarcasm] of starting almost exactly where you were caught with no progress rewind, there's no real 'horror-value'. There is only 1 event where you have to consider not just plowing through the map. Bottles on top of blocks that summon the monster if they fall? Brilliant, I love it! Showing every bit of what happens during that scene in your teaser trailer? Moronic.The end scene has a bit of redeming factors in that we're taken for a loop to find out our once loving mother is actually an abusive alcoholic stuggling with the idea of continuing on as a single parent. Lovely. That, combined with the recent dismemberment of best friend Teddy, we've basically witnessed the making of a potential psychopath. Maybe the sequel will have us mass murdering 1st graders!

I wish there was a more dynamic grading scale than yes/no.That being said, my biggest complaint is that this game essentially puts all of its eggs in one basket. The one point in which this game really excels is its visual effects. This game does an amazing job of not only providing a creepy horror environment, but it also really gives you a feeling of how an imaginative child may picture the world around him. Especially a child with a morbid imagination. It may not be as perturbing as Silent Hill's blood, rust and isolating fog, but the abyss surrounding the playground and the overgrown nature of the library really helps give the player a feeling of uncertainty and vulnerability. In other games the abyss would be viewed as ""I guess they put an invisible wall there, 'cause the objective's over that way."" but this game is in a unique position to utilize the idea of object permanence; even if the comparison wasn't intentional.Unfortunately, while I could feasibly recommend playing the game simply for the visual experience, the gameplay and storyline are not on the same level of expertise. The gameplay is not really challenging at all. There's no real danger of being seen or anything just as long as you crawl under something. Even if it's a doorway or a table almost as tall as the monster pursuing the player. I had plenty of times where I was standing in a cupboard, inches away from a pursuing monster who, simply, stood in the doorway until he just...disappeared. As immersive as the environment was, it almost got less interesting once the monsters started showing up...As far as the plot is concerned, the whole game pretty much all builds up to the opening of the sealed portal at the end of the game. There's no real plot advancement outside of progressing from one level to the next until right before the door is opened and the (plot twist?) ending is revealed. It...felt like it was SUPPOSED to be a plot twist, but with the child's drawings littering each level it's not too hard to figure out exactly what's happening. [I'll omit mention of the less obvious hints mentioned in later levels for potential spoiler reasons...although idk if it's worth not spoiling given how telegraphed the ending was.]Overall, my main reason for down voting this game comes down to the price. If it wasn't $20, I would still recommend a purchase for the sake of getting to immerse yourself in the environment (if you're the type of person who can appreciate that stuff). $5 is definitely a reasonable price for this game, but given the lackluster story and...(I apologise in advance) gameplay that will count you AMONG THE SLEEP (ha HAAAAA! Zing!) I'd have to admit that most people would probably find purchasing this game for $20 to be rather disappointing."

Whilst there are some well done / clever moments and the designer did a great job of making the change of perspective into something that was a little overwhelming and scary, the experience was more of a walking (crawling?) simulator with a rather overblown story.For a horror, it was more creepy than scary and the 'monsters' were very much more of an irritant that something to fear.  This was partly due to the poor AI presenting very little challenge, but also grinding visual and audio effects that made me want to go brew a cuppa whilst I waited for them to pass.Similarly, puzzles were unchallenging - pretty much 'pull this to free this' and 'move this then jump on it', wrapped up in fetch quests.  Not that other horror games don't do unchallenging, but Among the Sleep isn't distracting you with the anticipation of terrifying things happening.

However, this is not a violent/gore-infused game since it clearly involves a toddler (and ripping a toddler apart would be kind of weird). It is a very short game, one that took me about 3 hours to complete (and I take my time sweet with these types of games).However, this game is definitely worth your time. Even though there is no gore and violence, Among the Sleep definitely captures the essence and perspective of what it is like to be a defenseless toddler and have a wild imagination. The storyline is something that many people can directly relate to and it is a sad reality that many individuals go through/have gone through (I chose not to say anything further in order not to spoil anything). This game's spookiness will surprise you!P.S.: Although I thoroughly recommend this game, I suggest you wait until it goes on sale. I feel that $20 may be too steep for the amount of game time that one gets."

Why do you even play games, if you are in such a rush to finish them? Think of this as a great film... I got four to five hours out of it. Yes, 20 is a bit much... but if I am lucky, the Dlc will be free. (Right.) Anyway, to those of you that think this is going to change the way you play. NOOOOOOO! The story is genius, to me at least. You won't understand how brilliant it is if you are just a kid. This is aimed at adults and if you have children or grew up in a bad home, it will make sense. To everybody else, you'll be wondering why you never get to kill anybody. Grow up, then come back to this.This game really is brilliant and should be played by anybody who has children. It is not perfect, not even close, but it does tell a very important story that is sad, scary and beautiful. I know not a lot of people are willing to admit when a game spooks them or makes them feel uneasy, yet I will tell you this, I was spooked out by a part in this more than any other game I have ever played.Now, this is best played with headphones on in the dark. A lot of reviews spoiled some of the most intense moments, so dont read too much into the story. The graphics are nothing special, but they do the job and the enviroments are nice to look at. I also found the creature to be well designed.The puzzles are far too easy and end up being things that just slow you down more than test your wits. Still, the story and atmosphere are amazing. The real let down is the price since this game is very short and doesn't bring anything new to the table. If you catch it on offer, it is a must own."

One of the main reasons I got it was because of the fact that you played as a toddler, which was something I've never seen before in a game. And the other, well, because I'm an indie/horror enthusiast, so this looked really promising.The atmoshpere and level design are extremely creepy and dark, almost Tim Burton-esque. Every level was heavily detailed and as such helped me feel very immersed. What I like about it is that it is subtle, like Amnesia - nothing is really too forceful with trying to shove terror down your throat, instead it just eases it down nice and slowly, making sure you suffer every last bit. I really underestimated the game's horror factor, because it has moments where it's right up there with Outlast in making me bleed out sweat.The gameplay is pretty good; it captures the movements of a toddler very well. Walking upright, you waddle around like you're drunk, and you can also crawl on the floor, which is actually a lot faster. You can run while you are upright, but you risk the chance of tumbling down to the ground, so I never really did that. One thing I really found annoying was the teddy bear as your light source, because he obstructed a lot of my view towards the ground, which made it very difficult at times to be able to see objects, or where I was heading. Not to mention, he does not provide a very good radius of light, although perhaps maybe that is a problem with how I set my gamma, not sure.Well anyway, yeah, epic game, but the only problem is, it was too short! :C But oh well. I still do strongly recommend you get this if you want horror similar to Amnesia and with a bit of a psychological feel to it."

This is certainly the only one I am aware of.  I can give bonus points for originality here and in a horror title no less, which is no easy thing to do these days.Among the Sleep does a terrific job at immersing you into the world because of its engrossing atmosphere and ambiance. I will admit I was pretty spooked at certain points.  The mechanics are reminiscent of Frictional Games' Amnesia and Penumbra titles; you can interact with items in the world but there is zero puzzle solving that you will find in the aforementioned games.  It is more so a matter of finding and interacting with objects that help you progress through the game.You cannot fight the few enemies encountered, instead, you must avoid them at all costs and make your way past them.  This characteristic of horror games I have found is either absolutely loved or hated typically.  I personally enjoy it because it puts the player in a helpless state and gives you all the more reason to be scared.  This is, after all, the effect all horror games should invoke.  But there are those who are annoyed or frustrated by this and I can understand that.Among the Sleep unfortunately suffers from a few issues however.  My biggest problem with it is the technical issues I have experienced.  The amount of stuttering I encountered was surprisingly bothersome.  Considering the very short length of the game (anywhere between 1 and 4 hours depending on your playstyle and if you are hunting for achievements), you would have expected it to be significantly more polished.  The stuttering and major fps drops are distracting and certainly take away from game's immersion.  I could have 150 fps for a moment then suddenly it drops just below 60 and it is awfully noticeable.  My rig also is running on an 6600k, gtx 980, and 16 gb of ram, way above the game's recommended requirements.The last but smaller problem I had with the game is the save system.  Throughout each chapter, as you play, the game will notify you that it's saving which is all well and good if you die because you will restart from your last save point.  Unfortunately though, if you quit a chapter mid game, you will have to start that chapter from the very beginning.  Not a huge deal given its short length but misleading because when you see the game autosaving, you assume you can just quit and return at the moment of the auto save, not the case here.All this aside, Among the Sleep is a unique experience and is definitely worth adding to your library.  I would suggest waiting for a nice sale to pick it up though."

It terrifies on a completely psychological level with a perfect counterpoint of harmonious safety and aesthetically amazing exploration as you get closer to your mother and the end of the tale.This is one of the most intense five hours I've ever spent on a game title and everyone should experience this game no matter what genre of games you are into."

While the game clearly reveals its Indie roots by having a playtime value of about two hours, depending on how much of a scaredy cat you are, it's dripping with a great concoction of creepy visuals, haunting sounds and eerie music. It has done what many so called horror titles of this day and age fail to do; frighten me.

However, Among the Sleep caught my attention with its promise of an immersive world and a new perspective.  Both of which it delivered very well.  I started the game expecting to be scared out of my mind, but this game was very mild on the horror spectrum.  There was a small hand full of times that my heart raced and I jumped a little.  Very reminiscent of my childhood days when I remember being afraid to walk around the house in the dark because my imagination had already created all of the worst possible things that could be waiting to grab me.The biggest complaint I read in reviews was that the game was too short.  And really it was, however I also don’t think it should have been much longer.  The puzzles were relatively simple.  I got lost a couple of times in areas that seemed a little circular and the right direction was hard to decipher.  Otherwise the game moved at a steady pace.I’m glad I played this game and would recommend it to anyone looking for something to occupy a few hours of their time.

Drag a stool across the wooden floor, it slides okay. Push it across carpet and you're in for a struggle. You can't lift a pillow above your head but you can toss an inflatable ball a few feet.You can pick things up, put them down, open and close things, climb and even fall. There's no health bar so spills don't really matter. You wobble when you walk and make appropriate sounds as you move around.

The voice actor that plays the teddy bear has a very calm and soothing voice which ironically enough adds to the creepiness of it.Everything is all well and normal until you go to sleep and have your crib flipped over by an invisible entity. From there on out the world turns pretty twisted and has no sense of coherency sort of like a dream as the ways the areas connect to each other make no sense. Not much will make sense actually as the story is quite cryptic and you will have to piece it together yourself. As strange as the world is the level design is linear and well thought out so you should never find yourself lost. Most of the story is also told through the environment so there is a reason to pay attention to your surroundings other than the possibility of death.A large portion of your time will be solving very simple puzzles to be able to progress to the next area but there are a few stealth sections where you must hide and avoid monsters. These are definitely the low points of the game as it can be hard to indicate when the monster is near until you catch a glimpse but by then you will be killed. They just hold you up in the air and show a game over screen so don't expect violent baby executions buying this. Another problem with having to avoid the monsters is that your fat baby legs are nowhere near agile enough to move to cover quickly. As mentioned before these sections are few and far between so it doesn't really have much of an impact to the experience.When you are standing you will be able to run shortly before falling down and reverting back to your crawling stance. Crawling allows you to fit into tiny locations and is much faster than walking but you are unable to hug the teddy bear for light and since you can also run when standing there is little reason to crawl. You can also climb on objects to reach places. An example being pulling up a chair and climbing it to reach a door knob. You can also pick up objects and throw them but throwing doesn't really become a factor until much later on. The baby is surprisingly strong considering how hard he throws objects and is able to move chairs without a problem.I'd imagine you are not considering purchasing this game for the cool physics or the puzzles but for the horror. Among the Sleep pulls it off pretty well and being a toddler really helps as everything in the world seems big and scary. This isn't really the kind of game that will throw jump-scares at you around every corner. Jump-scares are rare for the most part and the game instead relies heavily on subtle psychological horror such as dimly lit rooms, objects falling and distant noises. One thing that I found separated it from most horror games is the lack of blood, gore or violence. It is definitely a breath of fresh air and shows you can make an unnerving experience without resorting to gross out tactics.The audio in Among the Sleep really amplifies the horror. It does a very good job at making you paranoid through use of sudden thumps, braking glass and just tense ambient music. Without such good sound effects and ambiance the game would have been much less effective at horror. Environments are unique and have the advantage of really making you feel like a small defenseless toddler in a over-sized world. Graphics are pretty good as well and I found it impressive how environments went from breathtaking to horrifying in some areas. Levels don't actually interconnect in any real way other than you sliding down a rusty pipe into a new location but it does end up adding to the surreal nature of it all.Overall this is a pretty good horror title. It does lack in gameplay and the puzzles are so easy that they will not offer any challenge and may feel like they are there just to give you something to do. Though considering the game is only two hours you will likely finish the game before boredom or repetition sets in. The horror does stay unpredictable throughout and they do a really good job at sparingly using the monsters to hunt you. Among the Sleep doesn't feel like a glorified game of hide and seek like other modern horror titles, instead it feels like a very personal experience through the warped mind of a toddler. It really does feel like a walking simulator with puzzles thrown in to slow you down but if you are fine with that there is a truly memorable and unique experience here that will remain in your mind long after you beat it."

Which will send you on a quest to find her through the strangest of places. You have you trust worthy companion Teddy who will keep you save and provide light where no light can be found. The camara angle was lowered to the height of the baby to show how vaulnable and inferior he is to the objects around him. The baby will also sometimes fall as his feable legs cant support the weight of the baby,so you can also crawl which is faster.

I found myself jumping into the water out of boredom just to hear the sound of crunching bones (from what I assume was some water monster eating me), BEGGING for something to kill me to relieve the tedium of collecting items, using them to open a door, and continuing, while the ambience and lighting tried to convince me I was in some kind of danger, then 80% of the time it was just smoke and mirrors and I was completely aware of it.I was SUPER amused by all the little details of being a baby. The cooing, the bear, and the pause screen is adorable - he holds his hands up and covers his eyes, like a kid would do when trying to hide from scary monsters - but all charm aside, I would NOT have bought this game knowing how short it is (for 20 dollars, no less) if I hadn't been suckered into thinking this was a bona fide horror game. It's a glorified puzzle game with some creepy theming, but Amnesia was both much more challenging and much more terrifying. This game borrows a lot from well-established series and just feels kind of cheap, and you can beat it in about an hour or two.To be frank, there were some very creepy moments. When I was being chased by the darkness monsters, I felt like they were clearly gaining on me faster than I could crawl, so there was a nice helpless element to it like I expected to get snatched up RIGHT as I was about to make it to a a safe place. There are also ambiguous crayon drawings, which is usually a cliche in a horror game - children drawing crude depictions of murder or creepy ladies with long, black hair - but in this context it was pretty chilling on occasion. At one point I saw what looked like a tall dark figure holding up a stick-figure infant above its' open jaws, about to devour it. It's rare for anyone to address the murder of children/babies in games, so that's a unique theme that gives it that extra ""Ugh, ♥♥♥♥ that"" feeling.Very ambient, very creepy, very short, very dull, even once the enemies show up. Wait for a sale, until then the LetsPlays will be just as scary. Out of 100%, it's probably a 68% or so. Nothing fresh or revolutionary beyond being about a baby, and the puzzles get really stale."

PERFECT. Krillbite doesn't beat around the bush, trying to draw out the gameplay with collectibles, and almost unattainable achievements, or the like. Instead, It focuses on its story, and sticks to it, allowing the player to truly immerse themselves in the unique scenario. There are sometimes lulls in the feeling of insecurity that you'll get while playing, but even in the calmer moments (with perhaps the exception of the VERY start of the game) there is never a moment failing to build tension.As a horror game alone, this title is very good, but it seemed like much more than that. The main draw of ""Among the Sleep"" is, of course, your character; that of a two year old child. Fear for a two year old and fear for an adult are two completely separate things, so when I say this game is more than just a game, I view it as an incredibly realistic look in to the child psyche. As I played through, I would have very vivid moments recollecting childhood fears. Things that are now commonplace were once terrifying! In a way, ""Among the Sleep"" brought back very VERY distant memories for me that I hadn't touched in ages. In one particular example, I had to put down my controller for a minute and just stare at the screen. Somehow, the creators had managed to build the scene before me as an almost perfect mimic of a recurring nightmare I would have as a small child. I'm not ashamed to say I stared at it for minutes before being able to proceed! In fact, the only thing I feel after beating this game is impressed.This game is surely going to be more personal for some than others, but it is a must have for lovers of the horror genre, and an interesting experiment even for those who don't normally find a good time in such things. Some people will say that the $20 price tag is too steep, but hey... support the independence! Right? Do that and Krillbite will surely be able to make more amazing titles for us in the future!""Among the Sleep""'s story is one that will draw you in and make you want to finish, and therein lies its greatest strength."

The general controls, abilities, and movement felt well designed and contributed to the world feeling tangible. I found the areas in the game quite enveloping and endearing in their creepy fashion. The game is quite short, even with the included DLC, and the monsters are a bit bothersome more than scary.All in all, I really enjoyed this peculiar perspective for a horror game and would recommend a playthrough (although at a discounted price.)"

The topic that the game is focused around is very real and very few times do we actually get to experience something similar to that from a child's perspective. Caught in conflict such as these, the child always remains the silent victim. Even with the unfortunate circumstances surrounding the situation, the child continue to push forward to rescue and save his mother (a touching story).  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good scare, is a big fan of great and touching story line, and can give it the 3-4 hours to play through the main story and intro.

Unlike Amnesia, I stayed scared after I 'died' the first time.  Your teddy is creepy and suspect to begin with, despite the fact that your character loves him. I don't know if that was intentional.

Among the Sleep was far better then what I expected it to be and much more deep also. It dwelves into the childs mind and establishes a form of nostalgic fear. It will find its way into being one of the creepiest games you will play as well as intense. The vice acting was great along with your companion Teddy just making it all work and fit and by the end of it I had very little to complain about. However there are some things worth noting about the game that needs to be brought to light for the optional buyers out there. First, the campaign is not long at all. Two hours tops. So this leads to the second thing, the price for a two hour game is a bit high. 20 dollars US regularly. If you're interested and see this game on a steam sale i reccomend getting it quick and instantly. Now also the last real thing I can complain about is that the game isn't very challengin either. Its scary and has its moments of wonder and intense hiding but really it was very quick and easy to figure out. So in comparison to Outlast (If you have played that game) this is a walk in the park. However I still find it being very enjoyable and worth the two hours and it will even be more fun to watch your friends play in the dark for the first time. Enjoy!8/10"

I enjoyed the added dimensions of playing as a child and found it really interesting way to show a different perspective and add to the atmosphere. As a toddler you are much more vulnrable than most protagonists and the childish viewpoint and items  juxtapose the eerier elements of the game nicely.I managed 2 playthroughs and all achievements in 10 hours played and might argue that it is a little short to buy at full price but certainly worth buying if you catch it on sale.

I'm not kidding...The game is unique, no doubt about that, especially with a dark story with really creepy atmosphere. Lighting, poor lighting, shadows, noises and music play a huge role in it. Especially in aspect where I totally love the game but if someone asked me what I like about it, I wouldn't really be able to tell what that is. I mean, imagine Alien:Isolation, but where you are a toddler. Total mind♥♥♥♥. It seems like Alien:Isolation devs kinda got inspiration from this game...The game is incredibly short (a bit over 3 hours including DLC gameplay), so much that despite liking it, I'm unsure if I could justify 20 € on it. 10 € yes, at any time. But 20, sorry it's just way too short despite everything. So, when there will be a -50% deal on Steam, grab it as it's the most unforgettable experience you'll ever have.

If only sheerly for the perspective not only in gameplay, but in narration...Just like the more well known FNAF, there's a lot of stuff hiding in plain sight that reveals some history and the going ons that lead to what's happening right now. Although this time you're not a security guard and they aren't animatronics. You're a very very young toddler of 2, and your life is depicted in drawings. Crude ones, as you'd suspect. As you make your way through hell and back you get tidbits of information that lead suspicions to reality. Soon enough, you live that reality.Some say the imagination of a child is the strongest. Perhaps that is true, as is depicted in this game. What is real and what isn't real doesn't matter any more. You're 2. The world is a big scary place and you're... You, in comparison. Tiny. Dfenseless. Horrified.I found my self mesmerized, comforted, calmed... Then was thrust head first into hell. With incredibly atmospheric gameplay and stunning music this game had me balls deep before the ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial ended. Sucking me in quicker than a whirl pool. Before I knew it the world was like I said, big, terrifying... And I'm all alone... Well, not entirely. Teddy comes  along to aid you but ultimately does nothing other than exposition and plot driving through the stuff that can't be explained so well with out actually telling the player.Teddy tags along and acts mainly as your flashlight. And my god was it comforting to have some ♥♥♥♥ing light. Keep the gama down, play in the dark, keep the sound a little high.It can be rather hard to see and actually explore with the gama too low and too high it ruins the experience. Finding the right balance of both lighting and sound is a bit tricky at first but once done the game is that much more amazing.Its a bit hard to find places to hide when you can't see though, and you can't use Teddy's flashlight ability when crawling and you can't run when using him. You have to stand and meander, which makes it even more stressful when running from the pants fillingly terrifying monsters chasing you. Don't forget, this game is incredibly immersive. If you get immersed, you'd be filling your pants too.The game is a cocktail of smooth relaxing and haunting moments of serenity while momma hums for you, or a music box alludes to peace. Then you get to a puzzle. The puzzles in this game are exceptionally well done as they force the player to explore places they may not have explored. Although it can cause backtracking and a bit of confusion. The game looks, sounds, and feels great though so meandering through the dark, in the dark, scared out of your mind can't be all that bad. After, and sometimes durring, puzzles there's sections of horror. Your little tiny baby legs take you in and out of the gates of hell over and over as the nightmares of the real world /are/ your real world. Constantly being stalked by gargantuant shadowy beings that are seemingly always 3 steps behind you. Always on your heels. Always around the corner.The screen gets a weird loopy filter and its Amnesia all over again. ""Runrunrunrunrun! OOOH FUUUUH-UUCK!"" Sometimes escaping is easy, sometimes not so much as you bump your baby head into the upper part of a hidey hole and get eaten by a hellish nightmare.If you liked Amnesia but want something a little different, this is the game for you. Had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ childhood? Want to relive the terror of said childhood? This is the game for you. New to horror? Want to try horror? This is the game for you. Want a cream pie on the outside, but on the inside its the heart of Chtulu? This is the game for you.Pros: Stunning atmospheric gameplay elements and music creating instant immersion. Simple control scheme that's easy to get used to. Pulse pounding horror as you run for your godamn life. Kinda casual. Best when played alone in your room with all the lights off. And no wall pressed against your back... Don't worry, daddy's comin'. Just don't look over your shoulder.Cons: Climbing and general mantling is a bit wonk and a bit hard to get used to. Perfect lighting is hard to balance because some areas are just so damn dark, which makes hiding a little tedious at times. Maybe a little too forgiving as each death starts you 15 feet from where you died with all of your previous inputs, that means everything- including enviornmental changes, still in play. Some puzzles are a little too ambiguous with what they want out of you. The answer is sitting right in front of your face, but that's the problem. Its sometimes a little too obvious. Sometimes a little too hidden.Either way it was an absolutely incredible game. If you have the money laying around I would suggest picking it up and giving it a go. If you have headphones you're in for a treat. Definitely one of my best, if second or third, horror experiences."

I did, however, find myself craving something more in the ""scare factor"" of this game, I find it more of a puzzle game at heart, with some big monsters that you hardly ever see. There's a lot of ambience, and a few forced encounters, but I didn't fail once in the entire game(Okay, so I fell of a cliff, but that doesn't count).I thought the map design and the mechanics were exquisite, crawling up stuff and using chairs to reach doorknobs added a new factor that made the game more intimate(keys and pressure plates are so old), but in all, it was far too short.With all of the crowd-sourced funding and open map design, I think this should have been a $9.99-$14.99 game because there is no replay value, once you solve the puzzle, there's no other way to spend time. Hopefully, Krillbite will have FREE DLC for the game(Like adding chapter 5 maybe), or some more achievements, or an alternate path through the game, or anything...That all aside, I suggest people get this game; but wait for a sale or a mark down in price."

They did a good job with putting the player in the role of a 2 year old and seeing the world through his eyes. The game isn't really scary. It does have tense moments, though. It's dark, disorienting and sometimes confusing...like how the world can seem to little kids at night. This is a fantasy game set in the world of the kids projections of his surroundings as he tries to find his mom. There was one part in the beginning that really creeped me out. The kid is seemingly all alone in his room, but a man's voice is clearly heard giggling from somewhere nearby, unseen, like a psycho murderous clown waiting to leap out and murder the kid. I'll say no more about that! The puzzles of the game were really easy to figure out, but this was a really fun and interesting world to explore. The art direction is fantastic. The atmosphere of the game is really well done. The game is only a few hours long. I'm a busy guy and I appreciate that I was able to start and finish it in one night. The only part that actually seemed like padding is the added DLC that is essentially a side story that was only slightly related to the main game. Still, it was nice to have that extra little bit to play when the game was done. I suggest playing this one in the dark with head phones, and turning the brightness down.

,Recommended,250620,13217816,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,Schadenfreude,"Among the Sleep instantly grabbed my attention when it was first announced due to its interesting premise and an unlikely protagonist: an infant. The survival horror genre excels at making players feel uncomfortable due to an increased sense of vulnerability the fact that you play as a toddler is Among the Sleep's most unusual characteristic, and also one of its best. This isn't just a first-person game in which the camera is lower to the ground than it would be if you were playing as an adult. When you walk, your steps feel unsteady; you can get around more quickly by crawling, but walking has its advantages. On foot, you can drag objects around, and you can open drawers, which you often need to clamber up onto in order to reach doorknobs or get to higher areas. By making you interact with the world in this teetering way from this perspective, Among the Sleep makes the fact that you play as a toddler not just a narrative conceit, but an integral part of your experience."

It is however quite short.The gameplay is quite similar to the Amnesia series, where in you are given an objective to complete but there is a monster lurking, and your only options is to go unnoticed.  Since this game has you you playing as a 2 year old child in a suburban household, rather than a student of the occult in a victorian era castle the subject matter is lighter, but only slightly.  It would seem that a child imagination is a powerful thing, and that left alone in a dark house with a very real threat lurking things can get dark quickly. It is however quite short.I was able to get through all of the story and the free DLC in ~4 hours. Definitely wait for a sale for this, < $10 seems more appropriate."

I don't know.The game, just so you know, only took me about two and half hours to complete.  I'm assuming that's because most babies have the attention span of a squirrel that got one too many jolts from a taser.  I don't speak from experience.  Honest.Where was I?  My attention wavered ...So it's baby's birthday, and Mom gives the little bxxxxxd cake loaded with LSD (I'm assuming, 'cause the game goes totally bxxxxxt later), and a broken 3rd-rate pirate knock-off of Teddy Ruxpin.  I was disappointed, 'cause I was kinda hoping he'd be vulgar like the bear from Ted.  Bummer.So baby goes exploring and has some adventures, and he finds all these crayon drawings somebody drew (maybe his Mom.  I mean, she IS the one that dosed his cake with LSD).And if you bother to look at the sxxxxy drawings, they kinda tell a story ... if you're into that.  Story's not very clear, 'cause whoever crayoned those pictures can't draw for sxxt.Anyway, as baby crawls and stumbles around his increasingly twisted and psychedelic home, he starts getting stalked by a monster.  The monster is really scary, so I don't know why baby wasn't screaming hysterically and leaving sxxt-trails everywhere (like I woulda been, had I been in that situation), but I suppose maybe there were downers in the cake too, so baby's fine.  Hides under stuff.  Spies.Eventually you reach the end, and it's poignant and sxxt.It's a beautiful game.  It's an original idea.  Never played a baby before.  Story's cool ... what I understood of it from those awful crayonings.  But it's two and half hours long.They coulda done a lot more with it.  I hope they have some dlc ...

What makes it unique is the perspective; it's a first person perspective horror game where you play as a 2-year-old toddler. The game really makes you see the world through the imagination and fears of a little child. The visual design of the game succeeds in making benign everyday objects look menacing when in the dark. Is that some sort of monster standing there watching you? Or is it simply a coat on a coat rack with some boots sticking out the bottom of it? Even your own toys can sometimes seem unsettling. I liked how, whenever you see written text in the game, like in an open book, for example, it looks like gibberish, since your character can't read. Sound effects are used effectively at the right times to evoke a sense of dread and fear.In my opinion, the star of the show here is Teddy, your imaginary friend teddy bear who seems alive and who is with you you traverse the dark, avoiding a monster and looking for your missing mother. Teddy is an ambiguous character; cute n' creepy. Is he there to help you or is he not to be trusted? He is well voice-acted, but there are long sections of the game where you almost forget he is with you because he doesn't have much to say. I realize this is under the pretense that you both have to be quite so as not to alert the monster to your presence, but I just feel like Teddy could have been used more in some of the middle sections of the game.I'm not going lie, this game can really get you into the mindset of a small child and I did find myself weeping after the climax and at the end. The game can be scary, but there's no blood and guts or anything. But be aware that the game delves into issues that kids shouldn't have to face, but sometimes do. The evidence to me that this game successfully told a story with some emotional impact was the fact that it gave me the feels even though I had a pretty stable and happy childhood."

Has your thirst for psychological torment this year not been quenched yet? Do you crave to relive old childhood nightmares? Then Among The Sleep might be for you...This delightfully terrifying experience grants gamers the opportunity to explore a creepy Silent Hill-esque world of terror through the eyes of a toddler. That premise alone should capture anyone's curiosity. For what does a helpless baby represent the most? Exactly... Helplessness. You are no soldier, no athletic investigator - just a baby in the land of giants. One that can barely walk on two feet. You don't get to see that type of scenario every day. But what can be said about the game itself?Both music and sounds, arguably the most important parts of any horror game, do not disappoint. You'll often be looking over your shoulder to check whether that ominous noise in the distance was really just part of the ambiance or instead a sinister monster stalking you. Among The Sleep definitely plays it's cards well, and spends a good quarter of it's length on excellent build-up to the main events. Especially the first big area, a forested house located within a foggy swamp, managed to freak me out again and again. I'd not want to return there anytime soon, that's for sure.In terms of gameplay you'll be collecting stuff in order to access new places. A lot of stuff. Perhaps too much stuff? Eh, it didn't bother me in all honesty. The environments are beautifully designed, and keep things interesting enough to overshadow the simplistic puzzles. I swear to god though... That evil forest. Or the playground before it. The atmosphere oozes greatness around every corner. You'll never know what to expect next. Better grow used to being all alone, for your only ""companion"" happens to be a teddy bear - one who also serves as a sort of light source if hugged tightly. How charming. Well, you take what you can get as a toddler. Flashlights ain't cheap!HOWEVER... Among The Sleep unfortunately isn't perfect. The second half of it, in my opinion, happens to be much weaker than the first, which feels as if the developers spent most of their budget on it, only to run out of significant ideas later on. This is quite a shame indeed. And it doesn't stop there. The game is also a rather short experience. Two - three hours, maybe four if you take it slow, are what most players will probably get out of it. And that length is somewhat disappointing, considering that you need to pay 20 bucks for it. Even the story, despite feeling intriguing at points, ultimately fails to outweigh these negatives. After reaching the end, you'll be left with that bothersome ""is it over already?"" feeling in your gut. Such wasted potential.In conclusion, I'd say that you should give Among The Sleep a try. I greatly enjoyed my time with it, despite some flaws along the way. And chances are you will as well. But it might be wise to wait for a price drop. Chances are you'd probably feel a little cheated to pay 20 bucks for a game that only last two hours if you play through it in a fast-paced manner.TL;DR: Good horror. Starts out strong, leaves a little to be desired in the second half. Overall too short for 20 bucks.FINAL VERDICT: 7 / 10"

Getting caught has literally no impact except for a 10 second ""game over"" screen, then you'll start at the same point again. This is NOT a horror game, it really isn't. But the way Among the Sleep uses its level design makes for an interesting approach to story telling.Just don't expect an especially creative story or challenging gameplay.

I don't play many horror games, I'm easily scared by their shenanigans, but this one never really tried. It was certainly unsettling, but that's only down to you and how long it takes you to realise you can run around and make as much noise as you like when no demons come out to get you.The concept seemed to be that you're roaming a hunted house or being attacked by demons, but with the killer twist that you're just a baby. This concept is explored for all of 20 minutes, after which you enter alternate worlds (the classic MC Escher-inspired linear platforming, toddler style). It doesn't help that you'll likely guess the ending and major plot points in the first 10 minutes. The characters say or do a couple of things at the start which appear to be hinting and foreshadowing, only for it to turn out they were just saying random crap you shouldn't have analysed.This feels like a 3-hour concept video or game a developer would show publishers to get them to invest and publish a hypothetical full game. It's tempting to recommend this just for the potential it has even though it never used it. Instead it's another game that's best right at the start, then they go ""I guess we better put some generic gameplay crap in there so it's a game"" and it's done."

Not realizing that this game 'could' be based on a true story I decided to give it a gander.Let me first start off with saying that if you are able to relate to the things this kid goes through, then I feel extremely sorry for you, knowing that your just a couple of steps away from blending in with the Addams family. I would also like to state that I will try my hardest not to ruin any surprises in this game as the game has very 'little' to 'no' replay-ability value.After playing most games I ask myself, 'Am i a better person now for having played it?', more often than not the answer is 'no!' In fact some times its even 'I am worse for having played it'. Not so with this game. In fact I left the game having a better appreciation for certain things than when I entered into it. Here's the beauty of the game and where the game shines. Basically your paying for the experience you get from having played this game and it's concept of making you view life from another perspective, that being said ... a 2 yr old.Here's where I began to appreciate things more. I began to appreciate how dangerous life is for a 2 yr old, a small puddle is something I can potentially drown in and a drawer in the kitchen is a ladder I can use to get to that toaster which could easily burn my face off.That being said, the main enemy in the game is a handful of monsters and the main one being a cross breed between a clump of seaweed, a Triffid and a stick of Broccoli drawn by Timothy Burton. The game has nothing to do with the supernatural, however you do know that with the need of avoiding monsters and finding memories, something must be wrong somewhere.The biggest downfall to the game is the controls, they were hardly precise and often felt awkward. For instance the hand icon to show you could interact with an object often appeared even if you were not close enough to 'really' interact with it and the designated controls on a controller for walk or crawl are the same ones needed to rotate handles. Hence instead of rotating you often would spend five minutes not being able to make up your mind if you wanted to walk or crawl on a handle. Granted you can customize controls, but i'm lazy and my idea of going outside is to turn on supermario 64 and get my character to look up into the nice blue sky. Also with the monsters always snapping at your baby feet, every millisecond reaction counts and if an icon appears to say you can interact with something, but you really can't because your not close enough, well it just heightens a players frustration level as they're spine begins to tickle the tonsils of the 'satanic evil brocolli'.There are a couple of ways to avoid the monsters. 1) Hide under beds or in confined cupboards 2) Hug teddy so hard you snap it's neck 3) Soil your pants and hopefully the smell will send the monster away. Unfortunately options like lay a couple proximity mines down are not in the game.The developers have really gone into quite extensive detail with the game which often gets missed by the players. For instance the mother has a pale skin impression on one of her fingers where a wedding ring would have been. All the books and covers in the game seem to have Japanese writing on them, this is because to a 2 yr old everything would look Japanese would it not?I would also like to point out that the developers have a 'credit fetish'. Seriously! The longest credits I have ever seen in a game. After the game finished I felt sorry and took my mum out to lunch, when we got back the credits were still rolling. The best part is, I later discovered that those credits were just a prequel to the real credits. After finishing the game you get to play some DLC and then treated to even more credits. Seriously the credits are so long that even the seasons change and winter steps in.The game will take you 5 hrs at the max. Most of that will be spent watching credits. There are very few games in the market which force you to think in the shoes of someone else and maybe we need more games like this so that we become more conscientious, tolerant and sympathetic . I really do recommend the game, it's worth the experience, but that experience is not worth $20.00 which is the normal price. Wait for it to go on sale. By the way my mum tried to make me eat broccoli soup once and it did feel a lot like what was going on in the swamp in this game. So yes you could say it's based on a true story...Addams family here I come!"

You play as a 2 yr old and venture through a dream world, or should I say nightmare world.

This horror adventure game does have its scares and environmental chill but it's not the scariest game out there.  In my opinion it's perfect for those who are trying to ease into the horror genre or just don't want anything too extreme.  But this game shouldn't be dismissed.  Like the other best horror games you can't fight the thing chasing you, all you can do is run and hide.  With a first person view and dark environments Among the Sleep gives you a feeling of being a child all alone.  There are items to find on you're way and places to hide.  If you want a creepy adventure this game is a must.Pros:+Graphics (not the best but still very good)+First-person view+Scares and environment+Not boringCons:-Sometimes climbing is finicky-The game is a bit short-The ending was anticlimactic"

I enjoyed this game - not only because of the horror element, which was very well done - but also because it told a valuable and emotional story with only a few words. In the minds of toddlers, many things and situations that happen in their lives sometimes don’t make sense. This game did a great job “translating” what was really happening into something that a toddler would see and understand. Moreover, it was absolutely terrifying. Many things make this game unique and different from most other first person games. First of all, the only way to transport yourself is toddling or crawling-which can make running away from certain death quite tense at times. Second, you play only two feet from the ground making everything around huge and curious. Third, you can see your body if you look down! You’re not a floating head bobbing around! Also, the baby footie pajamas are very nice. There will never be a dull moment when this incredible game is played and it may or may not make one speechless for a few days. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a clean and eerie game that has good morals and lessons to be learned - including not making a single noise. There is one thing all must know when playing this: don’t break a bottle."

And the first part of the game (the bit you see in the demo) before you (minor spoiler) leave the house is creepy as (smurf).  The end bit is also, creepy on an amazing scale.  Unfortunately, once you leave the house for the more fantastical areas outside...  it looses a lot of the creep factor.  I think the lessened familiarity lessenes the horror effect.  At least it did for me.    So, awesome beginning and end... less impressive middle bit.  (Though it was still good.)

,Recommended,250620,10285296,"Posted: 30 May, 2014",all,Sme,"So I just finished Among the Sleep, and I have to say it's one of the best explorational games I've ever played. To call it a horror is up to the player. Since there's a flowing narrative and not many survival elements, I think calling it a psychological drama would be more fitting.When I came into the game I was pleasantly surprised at how much detail had gone into the world (after my controls decided to work), and really enjoyed the cartoonish art style. The character models could have been better but that's a minor nitpick.Something else I noticed was the lack of deep sentiment in the early stages, and felt somewhat let down. However upon completing the game I realised what this all amassed to and why it seemed so by-the-books. I won't spoil anything but the moments leading up to the game's incredible ending are genuinely enthralling and some of the best I've ever experienced in gaming.I think the game's ~2 hour length is perfect, as it allows for an incredibly streamlined experience. None of the game feels like filler. I am however disappointed at the slightly disgusting price of £15. Yes, it is an incredible experience, but for 2 hours of gameplay I would never pay more than maybe £8. Of course I made an exception for this as I've been waiting a long time for its release.In conclusion, if you're looking for a PewDiePie-esque jumpscare fest then I really couldn't recommend this game to you. This game's horror comes from its subject matter and subtlely disturbing imagery. If you're a big fan of explorational games (Dear Esther, Amnesia: AMFP) then I highly recommend it, although I'd wait for a steam sale if I were you.Graphics: 8/10 (Incredible art style let down by occasional bugs and performance issues)Sound: 7/10 (Fittingly cheesy voice acting, and good ambient effects, however playing through I can see they missed a few solid opportunities for a good audio scare)Gameplay: 9/10 (If you like explorational games then this is basically flawless as far as walking around goes. If you don't, its minimalistic mechanics may leave you bored)Overall: 8/10"

,Not Recommended,250620,31741665,Posted: 14 May,all,SSBBrawler,"This game is dark. And I don't mean the subject matter (which is dark, sure, but not really that important). It's impossible to see where you are going. You have a source of light, but it doesn't really illuminate anything to be useful, and it blocks your vision if you're looking down, which is incredibly frustrating, considering so much of the game is trying to figure out which places are safe to walk. My playthrough was filled with falling down holes that I couldn't see because I couldn't look down or see where I was going.There are several interesting mechanics. For example, the crawling/walking mechanic could have been neat, but crawling's basically useless, considering you'll need the little light you have to avoid being completely blind, which is another way the darkness of the game ruins something.I can't really say anything about the level design. Everything felt randomly strewn together but that's because, again, the game is too dark to really get a good feel for the layout of the levels.There were some nice design decisions. I liked the idea of the house/forest area. If only I could have seen more to fully appreciate it."

Hells yeah I'm all about it.However, this is all meaningless as you will have a total of 2, maybe 3, encounters with a monster.

The game was incredibly short (2 hours tops if you don't have the lag), levels laughably easy, and there is no consiquences if you were to fail (I jumped off a ledge and 'died' simply to see what would happen... big surprise. Nothing).It is still bizarre why I lag only on chapter four whereas any other part of the game plays smoothly and on high res graphics.This game simply isn't the horror experiance you think it is.I'm sticking with my 2/10 rating.Though the concept held so much potential and the graphics not being too shabby; the bugs/lags, disappointing gameplay is what really killed it for me.If you happen to have the $20 to blow and an hour or two to spare, then this is the game for you.Otherwise, just go watch Pewdiepie play it.~The Proxie Kid"

Around the half I started getting afraid that it would turn into yet another 'collect 3 puzzles to unlock all 3 passages and off you go' kind of game. Fortunately I was wrong. It eased on that to focus on psyche later on. All in all a great thrill ride! It took me over 5 hours to finish the game (without getting lost).The only cons I've found are poor quality assets from time to time. Sub-par models and textures in the outdoor levels, some missing sounds (from interactive objects) and terribly looped sounds (washing machine). Lack of positional audio (binaural, HRTF etc.) is also a downside.Graphics: 8/10Audio: 7/10Overall: 8.5/10Prologue DLC comments:This is obviously meant as a small update. Also, the in the following notes I'm unable to distinguish vs improvements made in the DLC itself and improvements to the entire game introduced with the updates released after I've finished the original game.+ better music, MUCH more dark and tense+ new reaction of the toddler to danger+ it seemed to me that textures quality were better than in the original game- there's little of challenge- the gameplay feels a bit like a mini-game rather than a short story-driven gameplay"

The controls and interface are clunky, and the viewport is at a weird, warped angle, which just makes things feel worse. Even on extreme settings the graphics are sub-par. And the puzzles themselves are nothing to write home about.This game is an experiment whose success hinges on all of its aspects coming together to form a unique, interesting experience.

You're a 2 years old kid looking for your mother in a creepy, empty house. Sounds interesting? It is, besides few things that hinder the gameplay for me. Your best way of moving around is crawling. You can't do anything in this position (using your bear as a flashlight, interact with the most important objects in the game) and if you want to get up it takes like a full second to animation to let you move again. You can't run too far, because you're a baby, so you end up tripping and crawling after 2 meters anyway. The game is too dark, so you cant see♥♥♥♥♥♥ unless you activate your bear as a flashlight. This is helpful but you're moving two times slower (a common snail is Usain Bolt compared to you in this regard). The biggest nail to the coffin though is that it's just another corridor game.

A solid 8 out of 10 that could've been a ten at about twice the length. Worth a run through, and making me eager to see what else the creators come up with."

But let's get the good things out of the way first. First off, the game has spectacular sound design. There's always something going on in the world and you're kept on your toes at all times. Secondly, Krillbite really nailed the perspective of a child, gameplay wise and design wise. You feel helpless and you really feel like a child in the sick twisted places that the game has to offer. Also the controls are fluid and simple, the way it should be. The negatives are that the puzzles aren't really anything to write home about, with simplistic 'find item and use item' puzzles, that could've been shaken up a bit to make them more interesting and diverse. Another thing is that the game is rather short, with an average playthrough probably taking about 2-2,5 hours to complete. It really leaves you wanting more and with a premise like this, you would've expected a little more from it. Not to mention the ending, which felt rushed and was ultimately very disappointing. The price is a bit hefty for such a short game, so it's up to you to decide whether or not this game is worth your time and investment. It was worth mine, but check out the demo if you feel uncertain."

The game was short i beat it in about an hour and a half. Also the game wasnt necessarally ""scary"" it was more suspensful. Unlike most games this isnt a direct jumpscare game except maybe once. The game is suspensful because everything happens on a pattern. If you figure it out you know whats coming. For example: level three when I bumped into a bottle I knew it was time to go. That is the unsettling feel that I found great in this game. One thing in this game that may be a huge factor for people not liking it is the prolouge.

In the game the mother is portrayed as a scary lady and she screams and grabs you at random times and the only way for her not to get you is to hide, which keeps you scared the whole time. Also the detailing throughout the game is very good like giving off hints to show hoe the mother really was to the child. For example there was drawings on the walls that shoed the mothers actions towards the child and alcohol bottles were thrown everywhere showing her addiction. The down side of this game was how it ended and it was very difficult to see and move around sometimes since it was in the dark. The game ended by the toddler just opening the door to his father and his mother was left in the kitchen crying."

Many people give negative feedback to this game since it doesn't have a scary approach, but this game differs from your normal horror game.

I felt anxious and slightly afraid during certain parts of the game and the graphics are actually quite impressive.

,Not Recommended,250620,32189589,Posted: 4 June,all,Fugue,"This is a tough one to put into the binary of ""yes/no"" recommendations. It is put together really well. The challenges and obstacles  in your way are thoughtful and excellently designed to get you interacting with the world. I was never frustrated or confused. The level design is masterful in that sense. You are propelled further into this well crafted world where every object has meaning. Krillbite have put a lot of love and care into this experience.However, while the concept works on paper, I found Among the Sleep to be a little lacking in its narrative punch. My conclusion is that it is hamstrung by the protagonist being a toddler. Krillbite do a great job of bringing to life the world through a child's eyes. All manner of everyday objects loom large and will make you double take as you see monsters in coatracks and end tables with cloth draped over them. But you're also limited to having exposition be given by your teddy bear companion. You cannot read or talk. At times it feels as though you are being very forcibly spoon-fed the narrative, and it comes off a bit clunky. The concept works as both a fantastic creative constraint, but also a difficult barrier to overcome.I'm a great fan of suspense, interactive storytelling, and adventure. Maybe it's unfair to compare this to Frictional Games' Amnesia series and its successor SOMA - but that's precisely where this game sits. The same interaction methods, the same obstacle, narrative, obstacle, narrative beat - the same horror/suspense theming. Among the Sleep's contemporaries have hit some pretty high notes. They explore deep philosophical questions in great detail. Among the Sleep's message, which I won't spoil here, just didn't land with the same weight.I don't regret my time with Among the Sleep, but I can't recommend it over other, similar titles. If you haven't played SOMA, it'll knock your socks off. If you have and you loved it, this just won't reach the same level."

The imagination and creativity of a 2 year old takes scenarios and situations and blows them way out of reality. The scares of this game are sure to give you goosebumps. Best played in a cool dark room with good headphones.The game starts off with your 2nd birthday and your with your mother and father being separated, she seems to have custody of you and things are a little too much for her to handle so she copes by drinking a lot. With all the hallucinations  it's likely she was kind enough to share....she probably spiked the juice... You have a stuffed animal who can speak to you and help guide you. Creepy lil teddy bear. The perspective of a child wondering a house seen through the eyes and imagination of the 2 year old. To a 2 year, old parents can be seen as monsters to avoid during rough times.

The elements of saturated colors, artistically created environments, and lush soundtrack are well harmonized for a unique experience. If you're tired of stereotypical horror games, this is something fresh.PROS* The visual design is striking. The bright colors and dark shadows play over strangely distorted landscapes. The child's perspective makes even common objects like swings or coats huge and menacing. This is a visual experience that will not soon be forgotten.* The atmosphere is enhanced by the soundscape. There are bumps in the night, rumbling drones, and a haunting melody being hummed far off.* Without spoiling anything, the subject matter is interesting and well paced.* The voice acting of the teddy bear is another high point, being playful and surreal without becoming corny.* This is a very imaginative experience. It felt like reading a storybook, in a similar vein as the movie The Babadook.CONS* The game is extremely linear. It almost felt like a straight line going through each area.* When the monsters are introduced, it detracts greatly from the experience for me. The nightmarish environment lets your imagination run wild, so when the game becomes a hide-and-seek horror trope, the experience suffers.* The monsters become constant by the end. Less really would have been more, both for scares and for letting the environment keep the spotlight.* There's no story. There is a *situation* which you come to understand throughout the game. I feel that if the game developers were going to tackle this subject, there really should have been more depth given to both the ""villain"" and to the situation. Instead, the treatment feels shallow and even insensitive."

I mean, I ran at a monster the first time just to make sure I could actually fail, it all seemed so easy to dance around. Also for such a short game the images are very reptitive.I don't see what the point of collecting drawings is if you can't bring them up in a menu to look at.The kid gets stuck on steps into hiding spaces too easily, making it more frustrating than scary.That being said, I loved the intro, the way the kid interacted at ground level was great.

The story is good too. Dispite issuses I had with the gameplay I found myself drawn to finish the story. Unlike a lot of other horror games where you have to go around and read everything in order to get the plot, this game doesnt do that. It does a good job with visual clues to help you figure everything out; building to the final reveal. The last negative would be the play time. I finished the game in just under four hours which was a little shorter than it should have been. There are a few collectables hidden thoughout the game to go back and look for, but seeing as how they arnt anything but incohesive crayon drawings there is no real reason.Conclusion: at five bucks on sale it is hard to say no, but unless you can get this thing to work with a VR headset I say you might want to look around a bit more first"

,Recommended,250620,16947709,"Posted: 8 July, 2015",all,Muir,"Please note that this is an in depth review and whilst I have tried to not give any spoilers to the game, reading this review in it's entirety might give some of it away. If you do not wish for your playthrough to be spoiled at all, you may want to skip to the bottom once you've read the ""Brief Synopsis"" section.Brief Synopsis:Among the Sleepis a fairly short 1st person, on rails game. You play the part of an unnamed toddler who is accompanied by his best friend. While this game is on rails, it does allow to explore the game world quite a bit. The game is simple to play, yet provides a bit of a challenge by the way of puzzles and interactive items. The store page hashorroras one of the tags for this game. I would categorise it along the lines of being ""heart pounding inducing"". There is no blood, no guts, no real violence, but it's still enough to get the heart rate up.Long Review:*The following may contain slight spoilers. Skip to the bottom if you don't want anything about the game spoiled for you*Story:InAmong the Sleep, you play as a small toddler who wakes up in the middle of the night. Accompanied only by a teddy bear, you must brave the monster filled darkness to find the source of True Comfort - your mother.Graphics:The game is in 3D first person view and (I believe) is Oculus Rift supported (though you don't need it in order to play). The in world graphics have been beautifully rendered, with a lot of the items you find throughout the game interactable, allowing you to pick up, throw, push, and pull almost everything in the game. Well, everything that a one year old would be able to handle that is.Music/Sounds:Another huge plus for this game is its haunting music and sound effects. They're really well done, to the point where I cringed every time I accidentally broke glass objects while exploring the world.Length:Among the Sleepis not very long at all. Saying that, the plot is done so well that it doesn't need to be long. Indeed, my opinion is if the game was any longer, it would actually be to the games detriment. You don't always need a game to last for hours on end. Often, short and sweet drives the point of the story home more than long and drawn out ever could.Replayability:Unless you want to go for 100% achievements or want to speed run the game after leisurely playing it through the first time, there really isn't any replayability to this game.Overall,Among the Sleepis a short game with a really deep story. I highly recommend this game for that alone. The superb graphics and unforgetable music are just icing on cake, really."

I loved seeing the world through a childs eyes and the little details were really cool, like the ""spooky world"" was just the baby's imagination interacting with the house, the key on the baby stairs gate for example, everything was significant to building up a story of this child, the drawings of sad child and grumpy monster etc.I loved the level with the bottles all over the place that could fall and break, you really got a feeling of panic that how angry mummy would be if you made even the slightest noise etc, at least that's the impression I got.It was also really refreshing to have this sad situation where for once it isn't the stereotype drunken father routine, I really liked that.One thing though I would liked to have seen better use off was Teddy.  Although he serves as a kind of ""flash light"" mechanic, you can literally play through the entire game having never used him if you want to.  It would have been really cool if there was some sort of ""upset"" meter or something that would have you needing to cuddle him to stop the baby from crying or something and attracting the ""monster""  it would also have been good that if after an encounter when the screen goes all crazy because you're scared that you need to cuddle teddy to reset that.  Basically I just felt that teddy wasn't used enough which is a shame.The game should have been longer for the price asked... I paid £8.99 and that was with a 40% discount, and while I don't feel that I have been ripped off, I certainly wish the game was a good bit longer... I kind of feel that we were only really starting to encounter threats when the game started to come to an end.Would very much like to see more of this, hopefully some additional content will come from dlc or a sequel, but either way I would recommend to give this a try.  It's a fresh take on the horror fps genre and it's cute scary and funI'd give Among the sleep 7/10 lossing a little score for its price to duration ratio."

As a group, we tried twice to get into this, and just couldn't. Its an interesting idea, but in the end it can be boiled down to basically a walking simulator where you 'find the key' and 'find the door' deal.Pros:+Fresh idea+Makes youfeellike a small child+Graphics are decentCons:-Waaayyyyy too high of an asking price-The game takes some seriously weird turns. I thought the whole game took place in the house, but it doesn't. You go down like this garbage shoot and enter another world, which is really strange, and I didn't like it.-Basis of the gameplay is too simple. You basically just walk through the levels trying to open doors and trigger events. Its notterrible- its just bland and has been done a million times before. At this point (and for this price) I would have liked to see some novelty. Something fresh.-While the graphics are nice, there is some parts that odd. Maybe they were done because you are a small child, but I don't think so. Like as an example, you walk by a couch that is entirely too big in comparison to the rest of the room (lamp, coffee table, etc.). It just felt flawed. Or shoes that seemed too big. If it was for the child experience, fine, but I don't think that is the case.I would definately pass on this one. There are other similiar games that are better (and far cheaper). I paid 10 bucks and have buyers remorse."

The story is great, the monster encounters are exciting, unbearably tense, and are actually challenging unlike Amnesia The Dark Descent. Above all, Among the Sleep is incredibly creative and, despite its dark atmosphere, is very sentimental and succeeds in making the player feel like a little kid again.PROLOGUE DLC REVIEW:Among the Sleep comes with free DLC, which is a prologue which adds about an hour of gameplay mean to be played after the main campaign. Prologue is a skillfully designed addition to Among the Sleep and makes itself stand out from the campaign in several ways:- A chilling winter atmosphere, which is refreshingly different- Improved puzzles which require more thought to solve than what was seen in the campaign- Thoroughly creepy dolls to collectPrologue also expands upon the campaign's story, although since it's a prequel there is sadly no Teddy to keep you company. Prologue is actually very similar to Penumbra: Requiem, a mission pack/sequel to Penumbra: Black Plague. In Requiem there are no monsters to encounter, only environmental hazards and puzzles to solve. Prologue's only fault is that is pointlessly throws in a new monster which is a complete joke and takes the player out of their immersion. Considering that is all Prologue does wrong and the many other things it does right, it is a great bit of free DLC. Give it a go if you've played the campaign."

Finally a studio that creates horror that decided to take a frickin' break from all the blood, gore and overexcessive monster designs. Now we have a monster that is completely black, hides in shadows, and each form of it rumored to be the child's parents. I'd favor to talk about each aspect of the game and what it does well.THE STORY: 60% 6/10To be honest I didn't like the story, because it didn't make any sense. Also it was too abbrieviated and ended way too fast. It would be nice to have a couple more levels according to the little video at the end of the ATS demo. Those in my opinion looked way nicer and refined. Also if you were to add the missing levels as DLC I would screech, that would be nice. So basically the story is you are a two year old child who goes to sleep one night only to be awoken by some noises and a supposed paranormal being. It is only until you  find out your mother is missing  and see the first monster you know things are wrong. You take your teddy bear and venture through three stages *Five technically throughout the entire game*. It's... a nice concept but as I said. It doesn't make sense and it's too brief. At least explain in the game how this happened!THE LEVEL DESIGN: 100% (Solid 10/10)The level design is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! I seriously love every single part of it and it's entirety. It kept my one, colorful eye on the screen and it's like a replacement for the story. The story is low brow but the graphics are the highlight of this game. Every single level is amazing and beautiful. It's odd how something so spooky can be such eye candy at the same time. The level design even reminded me of myself since when I was younger I had odd, strange dreams from time to time that resembled this game, and after I saw Among The Sleep's level design I flipped my♥♥♥♥♥♥and went totally crazy over this game. I'm even working on a game similiar to this that will be created on Unity, *Fun fact, Among The Sleep was also made on Unity*THE CHARACTERS 90% (9/10)Now there aren't many characters in Among The Sleep. *If you don't count the monsters, I'm not counting them since they've got no personalities and just want to capture you*, pretty much we have the child themself, the child's mother, Teddy, and the supposed father of the child which we can get traces of in the introduction of the mother in the first chapter. I'll talk about the mother first. The mother is the supposed main antagonist (due to her connection with the odd tree monster in the fourth act) By the end she seems to be a redeemed villain and still loves the main protagonist. Now we should talk about Teddy. He is one of the main protagonist alongside the child and he helps them manuever through the nightmarish parts of his dreams. The ending which involved Teddy is very creative and I love his character.CONCLUSION:Among The Sleep is a great horror game to play at night due to the buildup and spook the game brings. I recommend this game, it gets a 9/10!Have a nice day."

If there is a puzzle to solve look for a drawer to pull out. Done problem solved.  Accidentally attract the attention of the monster hide near a pulled out drawer and it won't figure out how to grab you.  The game felt like it wanted to be a platforming, physics based, hide and seek horror simulator puzzle game but fell well short in all parts.  This was not scary.  I do have to say though I really like the 4 different mushroom models. That's is all."

,Not Recommended,250620,31545855,Posted: 4 May,all,Dakusan,"So far I am really not a fan of this game at all.It is often too dark and I can't see anything, even with brightness way up. I got stuck near the beginningWhere I was supposed to extract the teddy from the washerfor like 15 minutes as I somehow missed the icon that said I could open it, and everything else was so dark I thought I had been missing something elsewhere. It is obviously trying to do the ""follow the light"" thing, which is ""proper game design"", but they don't do it very well. In the ""first level"", I had a lot of trouble finding one of the specific [same] items I needed to continue as it was down a ""path"" that just looked like most of the rest of the empty wooded area.The novelty of playing as a baby is, while a neat idea, ultimately just another gimmick. It did not add to the atmosphere or ""fear"" factor at all for me. If they had made a rift version, I might have changed my mind on that, but as they said, it doesn't fit the game movement style.Ultimately, it's really just a walking simulator with a few intractable objects. No puzzles, or mini games, or even scavenger hunts (which makes something like Gone Home stand out). No thought. Just ""look for something that might be a path and see if it has a thing you need"". I really felt (and would bet some money) that this was made by game dev students at a college, in which they were told ""this is the right way to do a game"", and they just tried to follow the standard formulas.I'll update this when I finish the game (doing a run for achievements so it doesn't negatively add to my game completion rate) but I don't expect it to get any better."

,Recommended,250620,10403889,"Posted: 9 June, 2014",all,UnbridledEnd,"Great, terrifying game. From a design perspective, choosing to make the main character a baby is brilliant. It's like the hopless feeling you get when playing Amnesia, but dramatically increased. Speaking of Amnesia, the gameplay will be very familiar to veterans. Walk around (sometimes crawl), move things, pick things up. Pieces of the story are subtly told through childish drawings found in various locations. It's enough to be able to accurately predict what's really going on, yet it isn't stated plainly, giving you a sense of accomplishment.The jump scares were usually done on my own accord, like making the baby breathe harder after running, or knocking something over. The ambience, as well as the creeping fear that something unstoppable is following you, sets the stage for you to scare yourself. And then, when you laugh at yourself, something intentionally terrifying happens, and you go change your underwear.For those that care, the graphics are decent. Average to low poly models, relatively low resolution textures, but they get the job done. They are readable enough that you can tell a key from a doorknob, which is all it really needs. You won't have much time to focus on the scenery, or if you do, adjusting your view will make you realize that something was focusing back at you."

While the environments did put me on edge it's nothing compared to the fear of amnesia or outlast and that has to do with I'd assume the age and environment of the protaganist. Being a child in such an environment is creative and nothing I've seen before giving puzzles and movment and interesting feel. Had myself feeling like Alice going down the rabit hole at times. Pictures drawn by the two year old often had me guessing what is happening through the entire story be on on pictures and walls and boy my conclusion was wrong. Movement has a crawl which is faster but has no ability to use teddy, while walking is slow or you can run but trip after a few short seconds really making you feel like a toddler. All in all I'd give this game a solid 7/10 what really pushes it back is it's length I beat it in....TWO HOURS! there is little to no replay value I'd say once the newness of the fear factor has worn and you understand the ending. For $20 consider it buying an interactive movie ticket. I'd pick this up in the future for maybe....$5 to max $10."

The atmosphere is perfect, the gameplay is pretty fun, controls are smooth and feel good. The story is, just holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ The ending alone makes this game worth it. Only if you're a hardcore fan of horror and very atmospheric games. The music, sounds, everything is amazing, but $17.99(Price as of the writing of this review-$19.99 after sale) is not worth the content. For me it was worth it because I want to support them, I loved the game, and I'm a diehard horror fan. I also had money to spare. If I wasn't super hyped about this game I'd probably have avoided it knowing the gameplay is only about 2 hours.For that reason I honestly can't recommend this game. If the price was lower I'd say everyone needs to play it, but for $20 you could pick up more than 1 game, which will last longer. If the price goes down then I'll gladly say yes, I recommend this. Honestly I do recommend it, but the price is just too steep. I did a let's play/walkthrough of the game for anyone who doesn't have the money to afford the game, or doesn't want to spend the money for only 2 hours of content. Not to mention I feel they missed out on a lot of opportunities. The Teddy could've been more useful than to open one door, press one button, and be a glow stick. Not to mention he could've been used to include more varieties of puzzles and gameplay mechanics.Final word: Game is amazing, unique idea, fun, atmospheric, creepy as hell, and amazing. However, the price is far too high for this level of content, and I feel it fell short in terms of some gameplay mechanics. Teddy (Your bear companion) is only used as a light and only opens one door the entire game. He also presses a button that never moves so. Feel they missed a big opportunity to include many more puzzles and options for gameplay.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c5Tx77TIL4&feature=youtu.be"

So far the game is not “too” scary. The puzzles are rather simple and this is a good thing. I just put Watch Dogs on ice to play this and I am happy I did. This game is pure fun! My only complaint about Among the Sleep is that the game would be more intense if it stayed within realistic settings. The house is creepy and it would have been nice to have maintained a yard neighborhood, or other real setting instead of this Alice in Wonderland crap. The fantasy settings have been done so many times that it is boring or not really immersive; it just feels tiresome. None of this however means the game sucks, quite the opposite. The story is pretty good. Perhaps the best part of this game are the main characters. I mean, you play as a baby! That is awesome! And yes, you crawl faster than you can walk. Your battle-buddy the teddy bear is also a good addition. He provides light and comfort when walking, but often you crawl in the dark just to run from a monster. You don’t feel completely alone and the game does a great job of mixing cuteness with horror. I highly recommend this one!"

76561198008718046,Recommended,250620,10351946,"Posted: 4 June, 2014",all,Mr. Have A Nice Day,"'Among the Sleep' is an indie first-person horror adventure game on Steam, about the thirtieth to come out since Amnesia: The Dark Descent became wildly popular and everyone started pumping out crappy copycats like half-bred mutts at a puppy mill. Regardless of how tired I am of seeing 'of Horror' or 'Lovecraft' or 'Dark' being added on to a bunch of half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥titles, Among the Sleep caught my eye as a birthday game release and after reading the concept, decided to take a chance on it.The game's protagonist is a two-year old boy living with his single mother, and apart from thudding heartbeats and occasional toddleresque grunts of fear or exertion it's no surprise that the main character follows the Gordon Freeman camp of protagonist dialogue. This makes perfect sense, given little Gordy's age, but in order to give voice to the character's emotions and the player's observations, a birthday-gift Teddy bear takes on the Alyx Vance role as vocal sidekick, though whether he's 'magic' or just an imagined sidekick is left up to the player.It might not be immediately appealing to read that the main character is a toddler. It sounds gimmicky and hard to pull off, and I'm sure it was. But Krillbite Studios took the challenge seriously; the mechanics, story, and aesthetic all embrace this concept wholly and do it well.The gameplay matches the controls and concept; most of your challenges involve simple scavenger hunting, or moving objects around to climb on to reach other areas. This doesn't really get boring, because the game isn't very long. There are some wheel-crankings and such, but the puzzles are simple to work out and it's clear that Krillbite are more interested in seeing you enjoy the aesthetic and atmosphere than they want to stump you with a real brain-teaser. I mean for God's sake, you're a two-year-old; the puzzles aren't going to throw you for a serious loop.The environments are haphazard and nutty without being confusing or messy; the nighttime dreamscapes of an infant made playable. The art style itself isn't groundbreaking or super high-def, but they're clearly creating workable, playable, surreal environments that avoid the clutter-crap-style that some other horror indies I've played attain (cough, Anna).The triumph of Among the Sleep's style is that the environments start feeling consistently tense and foreboding because of how close and immense they feel in comparison to you. Again, they're really embracing the concept of little Gordy being a small, frightened child alone in a large, frightening world. The wooded areas feel like a 3-D rendition of Limbo with the level of character helplessness you'd expect to find while playing Slender.Among the Sleep is a horror game that offers a new twist on the gameplay and does it well from every angle. It has a pretty short playtime but also never drags on. The story ends pretty abruptly and the little details and hints are never made entirely clear, but the game ends with a pretty big emotional punch to the gut."

Some points I want to make.I've been seeing this compared to Outlast & Amnesia. Cut it out. The similarities end with it being ""horror"" genre, and the only option you have when facing trouble is run or hide.Positives ++Eerie scenery. (what kinda got me to check it out,it looked at first that it would have an American McGee's Wonderland feel)+Loved the visuals+Cool soundtrack.+Plenty noises and things that would terrify a toddler, amped up to make it spooky.+Pretty imaginative. Remember back on  the things that scared you as a child... well, yea, a lot of that.Negatives --Far too short. I even spent some time exploring the levels. Soaking in the scenery. Managed to finish around 2 hours.-Took awhile for me to learn any repercussions in the game. The Teddy would suggest being quiet, and I just would go about my business. Even chased a monster down in the woods before it disappeared trying to see if anything would happen. Wasn't until it caught me later near the end of the game, that I learned the monster does infact interact with you.-Very simplistic puzzles. (which I get it, you're a baby.)- How you're expecting the story to end, it pretty much does.-Just wasn't really ever that scared. I think knowing that I was a child, and that harm to a child in any game is pretty much taboo... I felt basically invincible the entire time. (at one point in time, to sate my curiosity, I did drown myself. lol. but just the thought that no real danger would come to me, created a ""Star power"" mentality.)Side notes-Lots of foreshadowing. Pay attention to things said earlier on, drawings on paper and chalked on the walls. You'll know where the story is heading.If you ever saw the 1995 movie, Tales from the Hood, the similarity between the two makes it very hard to not see the metaphor the game implies.But, it was very cool for an indie game. However in my opinion, 19.99 is sorta steep for what is offered with this game. If you can get it on sale, do it.I am looking forward to see what the developers come up with the future."

Nevertheless, I enjoyed the game. It was immersive, and had the child-like whimsy I'd expect, with a growing sense of dread and fear always lurking in the background. Even in the opening credits, when the black smoke crawls across the floor, or when the mother looks away and leaves you alone, and you start to panic in your chair, little moments like that helped seal the deal for me.The settings were interesting, pleasantly surreal and vibrant, even when they are dimly lit. However, most of the objects and things you come across are random and have no significance, aside from the scrawled drawings all over. The puzzles were fairly simple, which allows you to focus a bit more on the story. Or it would, if the story was much more than explore the place until you solve the puzzle...The monsters shocked me at first, and even throughout the first encounters I was paralyzed in my hiding spot. However, after a while when I realized they were easily avoided I had little issue and little to fear.At one point I even got caught, which sends you back to a checkpoint, and instantly reduces the terror they represent when they become little more than a funny looking obstacle.The ending wasn't a twist or a surprise if you pay attention at all to any of the sketchy stick figures, and the bottles littering the place. I was hoping for something a bit darker, but perhaps it's appropriate to have it be something so simple yet devastating... Poignant, but not very exciting.I think I enjoyed the playground level the best...Big issue is it's so brief for it's pricetag. $19.99 for something you're done with in a couple hours, with nothing in the way of replay value.

I loved the concept on paper and the events and atmosphere are extremely unsettling but the theme is just too on the nose for me. It's very clear what's going on from the outset and the reveal feels extremely biased without much explanation as to why things turned out as they have.Sure, you play a toddler, so technically speaking, the events in the game are outside your scope of understanding, but I think the devs should have considered their audience's level of awareness. That being said, it's still quite a ride albeit short (1.5-2 hours long.)"

(Yes i understand your a toddler but i just wanted to move a little quicker.)Then again if you could move that quick the game would be over even sooner. AVE. playtime is about 3 hours, and for 20$ seems a little to short when i got that much out of daylight for less, although this game is much more frightining than daylight. Its not on the levvel of Outlast, and Amnisia but it will satify your horror craving, the game has great visual and sound design,     The graphichs are ok, quite good unity. The sounds are creepy and will have you looking over your sholder.NOW ALL THE BAD STUFF-3 hours long- You move to slow- Lack of StoryLack of story is the worst of all, there is no story at all until the last 10 min of the game and once you relize whats happening it is somwhat in my oppinion under whelming, it makes scence but it dosnt realy make me think, ""OH, what a great story"" plus the very end is not explaind at all leaving you questions of your fate.- game breaking bugDurring the last 10 min or so right as the story was actually coming  together a game breaking bug happend and sucked me out of the experiance. I wanderd around for 15 min befor restarting the game then it worked fine, but its things like that especially at the end of a game that are realy just sad.- lack of monsters,The monsters are only in the game for all of 30min of your 3 hour playthrough witch can realy kill the tesion the sound design creates.The game is cool but cool isnt worth 20$. If you like horror games you will like this but just wait to spend your money till its on sale, or if you realy need an imediat horror fix buy The Forrest, it has more game for less the cost."

As expected by an indie game it's only about 2 hours of gameplay, and this begs the question. Is it worth the cost? I very much think that it is.

Teddy guides the player out of the bright, warm bedroom and into a dark, forbidding world. Stuck in this world away from their mother, the player must explore the dark environments and solve puzzles to recieve items which represent fond memories of their mother.The player explores the world by slowly walking through the environments or by crawling, which is much faster. The player is able to climb over obstacles and interact with many objects in the world. In dark areas, the player can hold Teddy tight, making the toddler feel more confident and lighting the way. The design is minimalistic and encourages the player to immerse themselves in the toddler's world.The environments are distorted perceptions of a normal household. The dark tone makes things appear more menacing than they would normally, adding to the tense atmosphere. In several environments, a dark presence hunts the player, forcing them to hide. The gameplay in these sections feel similar to Slender: The Arrivial but requires the player to hide, rather than run away, adding to the tension.Among the Sleep is short but still feels repetitive toward the end. The final section is satisfying enough to warrant a playthrough and the game as a whole delievers a well crafted psychological experience."

It's very polished and the visuals and sound are fantastic, so I don't feel ripped off.The two hours (ish...

Sudden loud noises (and many sounds like rustle, sound of something being scraped etc.)   lightning pop-ups, ""monsters"", which look like they were taken from a kid's cartoon - they are not scary for a grown-up. I would understand if the game was positioned as horror for kids, but it wasn't.Second - graphics. The design of the game is well made. Everything looks good  and not out of order, like a child would've seen (big scary coats in the dark closet, big furniture and other stuff like that). The only con is glitchy textures - they tended to disappear on my PC.Audio. Except sudden loud noises, music is very well made. It's very atmospheric and goes well with the game.Gameplay. The game is very straight - the objective of the game is to collect ""memories"" and find your mom. While doing so, you will face various obstacles (from closed doors, on which you can not reach the door knob and need to place a chair and got on it first to closed doors where you would need a key). When you need to reach high places, you will need to climb on them  using drawers, chairs and other thing. It's fun, but repetitive. The great thing is the message that the story holds (review  is spoiler free, so I'll just note that).One thing has bothered me - why a two year old child can push very heavy objects, throwing some of them  at a distance of two meters, climbing without taking a break like a professional athlete? Big chairs, tires - two year old doesn't have that amount strength.The game was promised to last for at least 3 hours, but I finished it in 90 minutes. It's really short for the money it costs. 20€ (18 with discount) is TOO much. You can buy it for 5, but not 20 Euro.So, in the end:Pros:+ Music+ Atmosphere-+ Graphics (+- because of glitchy textures)+ StoryCons:- The non-existent horror part- Repetitive gameplay- Baby has super strength- Very short- OverpricedConclusion: If you want to play this game, wait for big sale or you'll just overpay like I did. 5/10"

It is, however, excellent. The pacing, especially considering that this is a game that you can easily complete in one sitting, assuming your heart can take it, is absolutely spot on. The tutorial blends seemlessly with the flow of the game; while the level design is detailed and beautiful, and, while linear, doesn't feel restricting. The controls are simple, with no excessively complex button mappings to memorise, don't forget to lean around a corner or two though... The music is that perfect blend of atmospheric without being so attention grabbing that you stop feeling immersed. Lastly, the story, while simple, will definitely take you on a rollercoaster of emotion. There will be no spoilers here, but here are my four best bits of advice regarding Among the Sleep:1) Remember, all this is through the eyes of a child, let the game immerse you in such.2) Keep an eye out for the drawings scattered around, they'll not only help build the story, but may be key to your progression...3) Play it in a darkened room, headphones if you've got them (not necessary, but I played with just my speakers and succeeded in freaking myself out with the random noises in the empty flat around me).4) Get it! Play it! It's so completely worth it!Good hunting!- id_doomerFootnote: If your mouse doesn't work as a control interface, like mine didn't; it may mean that your joystick is plugged in, as Among the Sleep will default to using the joystick as an input source first. A rare situation in today's PC gaming world, I know, but toggle it off in the option menu and you'll be fine."

The ending is great!What I do have an issue with is with the questionable saving system and the checkpoint placement (I was stuck after the game crashed & unable to proceed, had to restart the game over again).Also, the idea of having the player regulate the brightness of the screen is great... until you realize you can't see a thing.

It took a couple of months to finish because I played a few minutes at a time, but it took me about an hour to finish the game.I loved the experience. I'm a mom of a 2-year-old, which is why I bought the game in the first place. The story is heartbreaking and most of what's creepy about this comes from the fact that this is a neglected child. Can't get much worse than that :(That said, I'm not an expert on child psychology, but it's funny, and I say this as a mom, how accurate the game is when it comes to being a toddler. They do climb on chairs and drawers and do dangerous things without considering what could go wrong. The mechanics are totally plausible.It's very clear that the world and the events are how a very young, abused child sees them: distorted. This is also why the game is so scary, you kinda go through the house looking for your mommy but at the same time know that if you make a mistake (e.g. break a bottle), you'll regret it. Fear of someone you love is just terrible, especially if you're so vulnerable, and this game does a great job of getting you in that state of mind.This game has a great story and it makes you think about childhood, especially as a parent!"

,Recommended,250620,16350818,"Posted: 13 June, 2015",all,Fireeye,"""Amongst the Sleep"" is a surprisingly good little survival horror game that invokes your primal fears by placing you in the body of a small toddler that can barely walk upright. What may seem amusing at first quickly becomes outright scary as the child's unique perception of reality turns seemingly mundane objects and locations (such as a closet or a playground) into pure nightmare fuel. Even when the twist at the end of the story reveals the toddler's terrors to be relatively normal from an adult's point of view, the anxiety and uneasiness you will experience throughout the game will not simply fade away, as it merely replaces the imaginative fear with a real one.Unfortunately, the enjoyment you can get from this game is drastically limited by it's very short length, with a walkthrough taking little more than roughly two hours. It is perhaps something to be expected from a game that evolved from a student project, but still, by the time the credits roll you may feel extremely disappointed and longing for more. For what little it's worth, the game still manages to scare the hell out of you for these two hours."

For the record, I am a horror game veteran with games such as Silent Hill 1 & 2, Resident Evil 2 & 3, and a ton of indie horror games under my belt. So it is entirely possible that my tolerance for terror is forming a bias on opinion.TLDR:+ Brilliant atmosphere, pretty much spot-on+ Great environment design, cohesive and consistent with the theme+ Decent Audio Design, even if the ambience sfx is a tad over-recycled- Horror? What horror?- Tone and atmosphere is very jarring, changing dramatically as game goes on- Gameplay is very textbook, and is altogether unchallengingREVIEW:Forget those shadowy nightmares, that teddy is 10 times scarier than anything else this game will throw at you.I really, REALLY wanted to like Among The Sleep. I'm always on the lookout for innovative ideas, and the concept of a horror game through the eyes of a 2 year old was certainly intriguing. The story, without going into spoilers, is essentially that of a toddler who awakes in the middle of the night, and upon hearing noises downstairs decides to go investigate and look for mummy. Controls are the standard First-Person control scheme, with the nice added touch of crawling for increased movement speed as opposed to walking.Personally, I think the level design is where the game does really well; the environment is designed to be really up-scaled and large, and it does a great job of portraying a toddler's perspective of the world. Chairs are giant obstacles that take effort to climb onto, fridges feel like a giant white pillar, and getting from point A to B is an arduous task.The atmosphere is unnerving and subtly sinister, reminding me of the foreboding and evil vibe I got from Dead Space or Alien: Isolation. Lighting is sparse, casting shadows on everything, and at one point a flash of lightning made a tree seem like a monster. A nice touch showing the power of a child's imagination. All this combined gives us a first hour of feeling really tiny and vulnerable, exactly how a horror game should do. I was nervous, I was jumpy, and I was really looking forward to how the rest of the game would play out.And then, well... the game kinda gave up trying.I had assumed the suburbian home environment I saw in trailers and screenshots would continue throughout the game, and since it was up-scaled to be so large this would have been entirely possible. But for some reason, the the game turns into the Adventures of Alice In Wonderland opening with a literal tumbling down the rabbit hole. We start seeing the atmosphere's creepiness being traded in for whimsy and wonderment, and any sense of danger just drops out of the game with an audible thud. It occasionally tries to remind us of its spooky ways with whispers, moody lighting and the occasional shadow, but by the third act I was so comfortable and complacent with the game that I just lost interest.I will give a tentative thumbs-up for the story (still spoiler-free), which is intriguing enough that I may play more of the game just to see its conclusion. But again, the fact that I lost all interest points to an indication that the opening hook for the mystery was not strong enough for me to keep me invested. Most horror games either keep you engaged via mystery (Silent Hill, Amnesia) or survival (Resident Evil, Dead Space). Since Among The Sleep isn't about a baby struggling in post-apocalyptia, it has to rely on mystery. Which, unfortunately, isn't very mystifying; it's rather predictable and overall feels kinda cliche. But like I said, it is intriguing enough that I'm willing to play more in the future. And since most horror games aren't actually that complex in the story department anyway, I'm willing to let this aspect of the game go unpunished.Gameplay-wise there's not much to talk about. It's a very standard exploration puzzler à la Amnesia. You find a locked door /  staircase / see-saw, so you collect X keys to open said obstacle. It's not challenging, it's merely time-consuming, and the puzzles involved in getting the keys are mildly difficult at best, downright trivial at worst. This wouldn't be so bad if the story was interesting enough to carry the game on its own, and turn the game into more story-focus rather than gameplay-focus. However, as established previously the game isn't exactly strong in the story department, so Among The Sleep falls down on both fronts.Apparently there is also a persistent enemy within the game that hunts you down in each level, but if there was I didn't encounter it. I didn't even realise there was an enemy, which is a failure of design if you ask me. You want a persistent, omni-present monster to hunt the players down and scare them? Great! So make sure the player is aware of the enemy's presence at most / all times. You can't have an oppressive, nemesis-type antagonist if it's so passive in its oppression.Overall, I can't recommend Among The Sleep. I really WANT to, since it's such an fresh concept. It's also visually interesting, the level / audio design is pretty great, and the initial atmosphere is damn-near perfect. But the writing and gameplay design let it down for things to remain engaging, especially for a horror game. I would recommend this game when on a discount, but otherwise it's just not worth the regular asking price."

The way you interact with your Teddy and the benefit you have from his company made it sort of realistic. After I finished the game I was so sucked into the story line I wanted to remain a todler.

You play as a wee two year old toddler navigating a world which appears nightmarish to your infant eyes. Many people will be reminded immediately of the Penumbra series when it comes to world interaction (chests, drawers, opening doors, object manipulation).Artistically, this game is lovely to look at. Coats, boots and everyday objects are made out to be creatures in the dark or stylized into the creatures themselves. The baby's room is well done and being able to look down and see your tiny self fidgeting like a child might actually do in reality is a neat little thing to include. The mother looks fantastic and the lighting sets the mood for the rather dark and sad story they are telling.This is where we get into spoilers. The gist of the story is that the creatures from your nightmares are actually your mother and, from what I am guessing, either your father or some form of social services worker. As you might have guessed from that last sentence, your mother is losing you. The symbolism that is put forth in the child's drawings scattered around the level was an interesting inclusion to go along with the theme of child abuse, alcoholism and misunderstanding that children have when these things happen really sealed this up into a gem.Seeing your mother in the floor of the kitchen, your bear in one hand and wine glass in the other weeping left me cold inside at the end. Realising that the witch in the well from your children's story is your mother and her alcoholism struck a chord and is relatable I'm sure to many people growing up from all walks of life.This is easily a gem and worth it at any price.Not really a horror title as I thought it might be more-so, but actually something much deeper and more meaningful."

You play as a two year old and it is something I have never experienced and it worked really well for the game. For the game to progress you have to be able to think like a two year old. Since you aren't tall enough to reach doors, you have to bring over a box or chair to stand on to be able to open it. While it is simplistic it was truely a new experience and I loved every second of it. The horror elemet had me tittering on edge and hiding under everything and in anything I could at the second I felt danger.

You take the role as a 2 year old struggling with family issues which manifest inside the dreamworld you spend the majority of the games inside. To complete the game you will have to solve basic puzzles and overcome distressful memories and this can become moderately scary in both atmosphere and shock. The biggest let-down of the game is the very short length (including the dlc) and missed opportunity to explore more issues that may haunt children (aggressive pets, strangers, being lost, etc) leading to the conclusion that the developers ran out of time or ideas. There is a good reveal at the end and playing through the eyes of a confused toddler is a neat concept (and original in games media), however I would not recommend   buying a game with less than 2-3 hours of gameplay."

We may not recall what it was like when we were two years old but at times, during the game, I could ""almost"" feel the uneasyness and unsettling moments we had when we were just a little child.So basically, it is a game that comprises of a playground mostly by night and that is usually a good location, but all that happens in it is a prolonged fetch quest to solve a physics puzzle. This is what irritated me the most.The foes in this game were mostly proper for the game progression.PROS:+Interesting perspective as a little child (everything is big in the game world!).+Visuals are mostly well done.+Excellent sound designs, music ambiance and voice acting are decent.+Never felt so safe hugging a teddy bear!+Free Prologue DLC.CONS:-Lenght of the game is VERY short. 3 hours at best including the prologue DLC (No replay value).-Big fetch quest.-Underwhelming ending.OVERALL:Interesting title that you can play in one night setting. I'd advise to get this on a sale 'cause 21.99$ is steep for a 3h long game, with basic interactions.RECOMMENDATION:Game itself ain't scary, at least to me, and may gives you a few scares at certain areas but overall, it's a pretty straightforward game to fetch items so you can move on to the next level. The strong appeal of the game is the point of view from a young child. I don't think it was exploited to the fullest so I do hope if a sequel get's made, it adds more diversity on the scenario and missions!I recommend for those who are intrigued in the premise of the game; ""young child"" exploring house and venturing the areas while seeing things!Just don't expect ""OUTLAST"" scare factor!PS. To the developers, watch or rewatch that eerie spooky episode ofThe Outer Limits: Under the Bed... might give you ideas for a scary sequel ;)RATING:7.0 / 10...better check under the bed before going to sleep..."

The interaction with the monster is very limited, and so it's not that significant an element in the game. It doesn't stalk the player, and there's no real cat-and-mouse interplay. As long as you keep aware of the nearest thing you can crawl under, then you won't have to fear much for your safety.If the developers had come up with an actual need for hugging the teddy bear, and if they had expanded upon the evasion of the monster, then there could have been a lot more gratification and strategy in the gameplay. If the monster was a bit smarter and more persistent and methodical in its search for the child, then the teddy could have been used to calm the child to prevent it from crying and giving away his position. Or something like that.The $20 asking price for this game might be a bit steep for the limited playtime and lack of any real scares. But if you can pick it up on a Steam sale (as I did), then the novelty makes it worth a few hours of your time. It's story is shaky in the middle act, but the conclusion is very human, very blunt, and terrifyingly real, in a way that goes far beyond the childish terror that any imaginary closet monster can create.Full review on my personal blog:http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2014/08/22/Among-the-Sleep-game-review.aspx"

The story of the game is that your parents are arguing on your birthday as your mum is preventing your dad from seeing you. As your imagination takes you into another world and images in your head become real the game becomes truly exciting. I really like the drag-drop objects in the game and the achivements you get for interacting with them, and I am a fan of the music.

It's whimsically odd in aspects that are reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, and creepy in aspects that closely resemble that of Slender/Amnesia. It's fun to play, might even get you a few times with some scares, and is completely worth it.This game surprised me in more ways than I expected. I was consistently trying to figure out the plot and whenever I thought I had it, it would change on me. The bear for one is somewhat creepy on it's own, and when you first begin to meet and interact with Teddy it feels very reminsicent of Chucky. As the game plays forward however, Teddy is your best friend in the entire world, as you navigate through a world that feels like the ""Other Mother"" built it (Coraline reference!). There's simple puzzles to complete to progress as you go, but they aren't mind-numbingly simple, some of them take a few minutes to put together.The story itself gives a fresh new way of looking at this kind of situation through a child's perspective. You're playing as a two year old child, and your objective is to rescue your mother from this nightmarish, topsy-turvey, alternate version of your own world. The ambiance is amazing, and the graphics are impeccable. It can get truly terrifying.I bought this game on a daily deal for 66% off. Among the Sleep isn't a very long game, it's only roughly 3 hrs of playthrough, so I feel better about paying 6$ vs 20$ to be honest. It's gamepad compatable, and if you're using a pc with Windows it goes without saying that it's recommended you use an Xbox 360 controller.It's fun, short, but not so sweet!

I, personally, hate kids.They're just pooping, crying sacks of meat for the first few years of their lives, and then after that they grow into spoiled brats, obnoxious teens, and potentially crazy adults...HOWEVER, that's all beside the point as Among The Sleep, complete with ""goo goo ga ga"" baby sounds as ambiance, is a very good game. I picked it up while it was on sale and I certainly don't regret it. Sometimes there are glitches in lighting and movement is stiff, but the tale it tells is enthralling and dark. Without spoiling it for you, I highly suggest you look up no plot/storyline before playing the game -- I didn't and it opened up about 50 unforeseen storylines all made up in my head. Any time I was wandering around unsure of where to go, my mind was stewing up this beautiful schmorgesborg of storylines, making literally every second entertaining.I've tried Slenderman games and a few other ""atmospheric horror"" games, but Among The Sleep is the only one I've been able to get through 100%. Complete with frequent ""AH OH **** OH MY GOD GET AWAY FROM ME OH ****,"" there are plenty of instances of jump scares while not  being overwhelming -- the anxiety inducing wait is far worse than the scare, of course, but isn't that why you're looking at this game anyway?The really scary part, however, is, even though you're PLAYING a two year old, you tend to feel more like you're PROTECTING a two year old -- this is a clever tactic that I've yet to see in any other game (mostly because I've never played a game from the perspective of an infant). Though the game runs extremely short, comparatively speaking, I really support the length the developers took it to -- it's certainly not too long, and they keep their story ""short and sweet,"" so to speak. They get across everything they need to in just a few hours of gaming.So if a short but very good atmospheric horror game is something you're interested in playing, pick this title up.

It is a bit short, but not as short as the 1 hour playtime that I've seen others give. I'd say it's a solid 2-3 hour game, a little more if you explore the environment (which you should). It's got a beautiful, touching story that reveals itself gradually. The environments you travel through are varied and very rich, with minimal texture reusing, which is unusual and refreshing in an indie game. The atmosphere is perfect and creepy, but not chock full of jump scares. The first parts of the game will lull you into a false sense of security. To say anything more would be a spoiler.There's no incentive to replay unless you missed a Steam achievement, and this game isn't really made for replays because the story will have been revealed. However, I think the first experience was solid enough and unique enough to stand on its own. I got it for $15.99 and thought it was well worth the price because it seems much higher quality than other indie games and I am very interested to see what else the developers can do. I highly recommend it!"

What I didn't expect was a game with one of the most amazing, well developed and eventful  storylines that I've ever experienced! I would like to avoid spoiling anything, but I can just say that the end is very well pieced together and open leaving for your own assumptions (although what happens is rather obvious). This game was the kind of game where you felt satisfied immensely upon completion, I personally was shouting ""YES! YES! ♥♥♥♥ YES! I BEAT IT!"" for a solid minute or so. That said, due to the games developing storyline and the way that all is pieced together, the horror aspect of this game kind of takes a back seat in this game only showing up with an occasional jump-scare or a little rush, but nothing that ever made me truly afraid.. That said, horror fan or not, if you even have the slightest consideration of buying this game, DO IT NOW! The fact that they can cram one of the most fantastic stories ever into a 3 hour campaign and make it all done through the eyes of a two year old is just..... it's fantastic.... 9/10 buy this game NOW!"

So when i first heard of Among the Sleep and started looking into it, it looked like a cool game with a good concept, one where you play as a child. This idea is brilliantly shown in the actual game with everything being bigger or twisted in some way due to children seeing things differently to adults. In terms of the gameplay, this game is clever. You can alternate between standing and crawling as well as using items such as chairs to reach higher places i.e. a door handle. In terms of what the game does best it is its approach to horror and tension. It doesnt throw out a lot of jump scares with it building up tension using sights and sounds for instance a passing glimpse of some other creature or hearing a door slam. It is nearer the end of the game in which you start to encounter some other creaturs but I am not saying how this is done.Overall this game is clever and very good even though it is only 2-3 hours long. Also the recently released free downloadable content adds a strong 20 minutes of additional gameplay, one which is a prologue to the events of the main game. I would thorougly recommend this game to anyone."

I went into Among the Sleep with minimal information, I just saw that you played as a infant, and I knew I had to have it. The adventure that followed starting from 12 to around 3 in the morning some might say was shortlived, however I loved every bit of it. The atmosphere, symbolism, and thought that this game provokes stemming from the question of what is real and what is imagination from the point of a two year old was comparable in complexity to the ending of Bioshock Infinite. I also find it comparable to movies such as American Psycho and Donnie Darko in the same way. Not everyone will have the same interpretation, although I have heard very good ones in the forums. If you expect from this game cheap jumps scares or award winning graphics or action, look somewhere else. This game is more of an allegory within a haunting art form, and I will fondly remember those nearly three hours I spent on this game, as  I will also remember what I took away."

I wanted there to be epic teddy bear transformations and bedroom weapons, but we can't all have what we want. There was a lot of hiding involved though and bottles. Boy, were there a lot of bottles.

This game kind of struck me as a combination between Slender and the movie ""Mama"". You'll figure out why once you've tried it out.The graphics and sounds were nice enough, but the story was something else altogether. Mind you, it was great and different, but it was no fairytale.

Somehow, this makes the whole thing that much more terrifying, even if the game itself isn't a pants-filler like Outlast. It's not just that you're defenseless and don't want to get eaten by some monstrosity, but you also don't want the little kid you're playing to get hurt either. It definitely adds to the fear.As others have said, the game is a bit short, although they recently added some free DLC, which helps round it out a bit. The design is interesting in that it actually feels like what a toddler might imagine based on the pieces he can put together from the world and events around him. It even reminded me of snippets that I can remember from when I was a little kid, from imaginary worlds to fragments of dreams.The mechanics are relatively simple and involve a fair amount of finding Tab A and getting it into Slot B before progressing. It's a common element in many games, and at least it isn't obstructive or overt here.The story is what got to me, though. I don't want to spoil anything, but pay attention to those crayon drawings you see littering the place and various recurring themes and objects. Some parts were fairly obvious, some were a bit of a surprise, but regardless, it was heartbreaking at points. Making the player a little kid brings out the sadness of many things.I definitely recommend picking this one up. If you're wary, grab the demo or wait for a sale. Parents playing this game might just find themselves giving their kids a big hug after playing."

It would be awesome if it had only been a reasonable length. £15 is an aweful lot to spend on maybe 1-2 hrs of a game. If I'd bothered to read other reviews and known about the short length before-hand I wouldn't have bought it right now, I would have saved buying it until I felt flush enough to spend that much on a couple hours fun. But hey-ho, it's done now. It was very effective at creating that eerie vibe, and I'd love to see it on the oculus rift just to see it and experience the game again from that perspective, I'd guess the added immersion could only enhance the experience. All in all Among the Sleep was worth buying just for that experience alone. The game aspect to it is not as developed as I personally would have liked, but the creators have made a game which is worth playing.

The toddler perpective is also the ""glue"" that brings the otherwise un-relatable story layers together.What makes the game very special is the ""mind♥♥♥♥"" aspect. The game starts with two layers of story -the ""real world"" and the phantasy world of the toddler where the main quest takes place. At the very end of the game, both layers are enriched by a background story (meta layer) which puts all events into a new - and very disturbing - perspective. To avoid spoilers I will not go into details.I cannot name another game that made me think about its story that way - and especially, in what position the game puts me as a player. Enjoying the ""main quest"" as a toddler is the obvious purpose of the game, but things get uncomfortable when it is revealed what the main quest represents.All this is delivered without being overly mysterious and confusing (compared to movies of this type) and without the usage of the ususal ""tools"" - very creepy environemtns, gore and violence - it only happens in your mind when you think through the different levels of the story.This game is actually story-driven in the best possible way, but also still relies on traditional game mechanics - which differentiates it from walking simulators.The only (mild) complain that I have is the short playtime."

At first I didn't know what to make of it, considering its from the perspective of a toddler and was leery about getting it on that merit alone however I am extremely glad I got over it. The unique perspective of the toddler really lends to the whole story portrayed throughout the game. (sorry no spoilers :) ) DLC really does expand upon the story and though it does leave a couple more questions in the mind for possible more DLC later on down the road, what it does add does make you pause and blink. I know I did.Pros:*Unique perspective of the toddler + eye level items ( makes you have to *THINK* to get around some obstacles you'd normally just walk up to and click, in other games)*Dispite being a first person camera perspective, the shaking/movement animations do *not* incite the usual motion sickness nausea that usually accompany's such ""realistic"" perspective in a game. I contribute this to this game being VR compatible and that it must have gotten play tested very well to look for such problems for VR users. (don't know how many games utilize this first person camera perspective and because the camera is going EVERYWHERE, its a game I cannot play in one sit thru. Among the Sheep, does *NOT* have this problem. Was able to play through it in one sitting with much enjoyment had.)*Ambience + level music lends more to the suspense/horror as you play. ( If I'm not mistaken some of the undertones are suppose to supposedly resonate with the player to highten this suspense. Probably mistaken but if your ears are keen or have heard those tones before that may influence mood, might make the same mistake in thinking the undertones are the same. *shrug*)*The drawings, pictures and monsters = story line goodness (try and see them all!). Especially if playing pretty much uninterrupted by RL things, the monsters (there's technically two if take into consideration the DLC) really lend to the feeling of dread and will probably have you either shock/startle when they appear, or hiding in a closet from a meer noise that might possibly somehow in a far flung galaxy be indication that the monster's coming to possibly eat you, or whatever it does when the screen turns black! ( dun dun Dun!)* Teddy Bear Companion. This little guy, how they put him throughout the game, there's always this nagging feeling, just by how he talks, what he asks of your character, if you should trust him. I think because of the way the companion was made and what it adds to the game, you do have that added layer that some games lack in creating attachment to sidekicks.*Graphics=Awesome. There's not much more to be said on that point, provided you have your settings at the optimum for your system and calibrated the gamma correctly to give that spooky look, you're gonna have a great time. Even the pieces of wood have breakpoints and lines, the detail on the items the toddler has to crawl over you can tell someone put a lot of work into those little points that really bring out the mental mind trip Alice in wonderland vibe. ( Makes you almost wonder what exactly was in that happy birthday baby bottle at the begining before the cake!  Ha.)ConsUnfortunately, with how much I *loved* playing this game. I did find two picky little Cons.* End Credits. Awesome to pay respect to all the backers from ever and always but it does make the credits uber long to sit through. Took me a good few times of pressing escape before being able to get out of the long list of credits. Sitting though the whole thing on the DLC, took enough time to get up, get a drink, go use the washroom and come back in enough time for it to still be going through the R names. LOL. Certainly there has to be an easier way on the main interface to give all the backers and such recognition than a long scroll screen where its hard to catch all their names, but again, like I said. ""that's me being picky.""* DLC is a little hard to find. At first I didn't realize it had downloaded DLC when I first booted up the game. If it wasn't for beating the game and deciding to go back and replay some chapters, I wouldn't know that the DLC is listed in the Chapter Selection, portion of the main menu and I may have missed out on playing some EPIC DLC. The extra story the DLC adds on, especially if you play it AFTER the main game, makes one sit back and go Dayuum.Overall this is a great game and I recommend it, especially if you have time to dedicate going through an entire playthru uninterrupted. Another time I tried playing it, and I constantly had to set it down and pick it back up again, really had not as many of the features pop out or strike me as the first time, when well, you've been playing it for hours and all that ambience has gotten to you. HA! :)  I really recommend playing the DLC after the Main game, for a different perspective on the game story. I played it both with DLC first, then main game, and also Main game with DLC after. Found doing it one way over the other, tends to lend itself to one verson of understanding the story while doing the other, makes one almost ponder a complete nother.  As to what I'm talking about! Play the game! can you note the difference I""m speakin' of?Lady"
,Recommended,250620,13157223,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,Blooey,"Among the Sleep takes players on a journey through a nightmarish dreamworld concieved by a toddler's imagination, and molded by the disturbing issues he faces in real life. The concept is certainly fresh, but does the game itself hold up under scrutiny?It's abundantly clear from the start that the developers of Among the Sleep have spent a lot of time carefully constructing the environments in this game. Many of the objects and locations are made up of very authentic-looking artifacts that you might see scattered around a toddler's room in real life. Some of them are used to frightening effect, such as removing the eyes from an otherwise adorable stuffed animal, or making the seemingly innocent drawings of a child take on a far more sinister meaning. All of these conscientious design choices come together quite effectively, and the atmosphere benefits greatly from it.One of the biggest concerns I had for this game was if it could deliver true horror. The kind of horror that slowly and carefully builds into a suffocating climax of fear. Thankfully, I was not dissapointed. The game doesn't pull any punches, and although it takes some time at the beginning to establish the story, the rest of the game is a non-stop, exhilariting tour into darkness.Well...for the most part.The puzzles in the game are never demanding, and they don't really increase in difficulty much. Most of them involve collecting specific items or keys, and taking them to the correct location, which is all too easy considering how linear the game is. It's almost a nitpick, considering how frequently the game excels at building tension and fear through its various assets, but I would have appreciated a bit more complexity and origniality when it came to the actual gameplay.At the end of the day, the biggest problem I had with this game was its length. Sure, its well-paced. It has great visuals, great voice-acting, great sound design...but if the game can be beaten in 2 hours or less, you're not getting much value for your money. I expect a little more content from a game thats list price is $20. Some might argue that all of that money is well-spent considering how much obvious love and effort was put into this game, and how amazing it turned out to be considering that it was created by a very small indie development team, but in my personal opinion, $20 is still too much to ask for such a short game, with so little replay value.If you can get it on sale though, Among the Sleep is a very solid horror experience. If you've enjoyed games like Amnesia or Outlast, Among the Sleep will deliver more of the same great storytelling, audio design, and horror you've come to expect from those games, albeit on a much smaller scale.7.5/10"

And if you don't get the collectables during the actual gameplay you can't collect them when you go back after the game is over and try to collect them by replaying the chapters that they are in. The game is slow and grundgy. There are bits of pleasure throughout, but it is basically pure muck. And, eventually succumbs itself to a bitter disappointment. Don't expect too much when playing this game. Although, there are good moments...if there were a grading scale from SUCKS-to SUCKED! Then let's just say it's Sucks!

The atmosphere is really nice and I really like the concept, but it feels like the game is trying to be scary without anything that's actually scary.  You don't encounter an enemy until you're 3/4 through the game, and if an enemy catches you it merely resets you about 10 feet back from where you were caught and now the enemy no longer spawns, meaning there's no punishment for being caught and therefore no tension.  There are also quite a few issues with textures clipping through each other, partciuarly with your characters hands when climbing.  The graphics aren't spectacular.  Opening drawers shows a clearly flat texture, with no attempt to make anything inside the drawer look remotely 3D.  It's also incredibly short, no more than an hour and a half long.

Your mom gives you a teddy bear who begins talking to you. You wake up to see your teddy bear being dragged off and your mom is missing. You then proceed with basically what I would call nightmere realms trying to find out where your mom went to. At the end of each level you collect items relating to your mom allowing you to unlock the next level. I would reccomend this to any horror lovers. The atmosphere makes you feel uneasy and like you are being watched. The music adds to the ambiance of the game. The puzzles range from easy to hair ripping out hard but overall a fun time to be had.

Does not trap the mouse in fullscreen, so on a multimonitor setup the mouse will sometimes exit the game when you click it (annoying when chased by monster guy and trying to hide). Some inventory bugs, also some graphical issues on light sources.But the stuttering is the worst i've seen in a while.

I also do not recommend this to inpatient people because this game is to long in my opinion and it gets frustrating. The game creates this character that is not revealed to the player until the end, so that is one of the reasons why to play the game because who wouldn’t want to know who this mysterious character is. The game is more of a mystery game then a horror game, but n certain parts of the game is a bit frightening because you start to encounter different characters and they pop out unexpectedly.

The narrative goes to some nightmarish places, but it ends all too abruptly, and technical issues apply the sleeping cap to an already mixed release. The story behind the game is a well-written script and the ending is just a little heart warming. One problem the player might have is the control part.

They make sense, with them being a toddler, but the game features a slow waddle in the up-right standing position and a faster crawl. I found myself almost bugging out the game switching back and forth too quickly so I could move around at a faster pace. If you just slow down the animations get laggy, but as long as you let yourself fall into the game this shouldn't be an issue for you. Other than that has pretty good overall controls and mechanics.

Overall, the game has a very unique idea, an original concept, and a wonderful short storytelling experience, but the only downfall is wanting more out of the game. Personally I wanted a little bit more out of the game, more to the story, perhaps what happens next after the father takes the child. Will the mother ever come back? Will she regain strength and fix her issues with alcoholic? Questions left me to wondering on what could happen next.

The story becomes somewhat predictable as you progress, but collecting the clues is surprisingly fulfilling. Controlling a helpless baby makes the game that much more uncomfortable, but in a good way, not annoyingly so as I expected. It's a solid game if you're into psychological horror, and probably even if you aren't. When I first wrote the review it was $20 and now it's $15, but I wouldn't recommend paying that much if you can avoid it due to how short the story is. I snagged it on sale for 5 or 10 bucks when it came out.Tip: Don't turn your gamma too far down. If it's too dark it goes from immersive to just annoyingly difficult.

It doesn't have the greatest graphics in the world, but in this fantasy world that's not really necessary either. The only place where it bothers a bit is when the game tries to render humans,. But luckily there's only one (mommy) and we only see her very briefly.The formula revolves around navigating levels and collecting items in order to advance, whilst remaining unseen by the scary evil that roams the world. And let me tell you, when it is near, you feel its presence. This is where the game really distinguishes itself in my opinion: the evil presence is quite scary, and it will make you play it cautious so as to not invoke its wrath. Very well executed.There's little replay value though, and even the extra story in the free DLC was unnecessary in my opinion. It's also a step down from the main storyline if you ask me. It failed to captivate me because of its repetitive formula and unreasonable expectations of wilful suspension of disbelief compared to the main storyline. Then again, nobody forces you to play it, and the main storyline is definitely worth it even if it doesn't have a lot of replay value.

Not many options to get lost or explore for yourself like in the Amnesia or Penumbra series.From an asthetic standpoint it is fascinating, since light, colors, voices, sounds, music and so on play together so well. You can immerse yourself in the life of a toddler. I can't say anymore because that would be a spoiler - but play it not just for the asthetics but for the great story as well. You can guess halfway through what the story is gonna be, but it has been implemented just too good.Recommendation from my end - you have to decide wheather the price tag is justified by the short playtime."

It's a beautiful game that manages to escalate in tension the further along you go (as I feel a good horror game should...). The simplisity of the story and some really good voice acting help enhance this quite a bit and I found myself getting sucked into the world. And the one element that sets this game apart from many others is its dark underlying tone beneath this bright & colorful looking game.My only set backs are that its very short; you could beat this in 2-3 hours if you fly through it. Also, the game machanics can be slightly frustrating as you may hit the occasional hidden wall or struggle to step onto a platform.Rating: 7.5/10Had this game been at least another hour longer, I would easily give it a higher score..."

However, if you take your time, turn your volume up high, and make your way through it slowly enough to really enjoy all the little nuances, it's definitely worth the play.I really do mean it about the volume. The sound effects are one of the best parts about this game, and it genuinely spooked me and gave me a few scares (which don't come easily to me in these games). It had me running (or rather, crawling) under tables to hide from noises frequently for no reason other than some noise scaring the pants off me.What a unique idea for a game! Really enjoyed it."

Finally got around to it, and while it's taking a slightly different turn than I expected - dipping more into surreal dreamlike locations than the house itself - I'm enjoying it.The mother's character model was initially a bit off-putting, likely because of how close to her face you tend to be as she carries you through the house, but the rest of the game is beautiful; the house, while fairly typical, looms up around you from your low vantage point, and as you get deeper into surreality, things just keeping getting more gorgeous - and creepy.There are some odd POV clipping issues, and occasional vocal prompts that don't seem to be relevent (mainly in the beginning as you're told to be quiet - often I'm expecting a stealth-type gameplay where there really isn't a need for it) but overall the game is enjoyable."

Playing as a child is perfect starting point as you are so helpless and vulnerable, you can either walk slowly or crawl but you cannot see too far when crawling. The atmosphere is what makes this game so good. It starts off with a very creepy oppressive atmosphere where you never know what dangers are lurking. Then just when you are thinking it is only a sinister atmosphere and there are no actual threats you catch a glimpse of enemies. There are no really cheap jump scares but lots of menacing corner of the screen glimpses of things and when you do first get caught by the enemy it is terrifying. So this manages to maintain the atmosphere throughout that game where you are never sure if you are in danger or not. My only complaint is that some of the camera movements when climbing made me a little nauseous."

Yes, there are a couple of jump-scares down the road, but that's it. It doesn't play with your anxierty like Outlast: Whistleblower does.When I first started Among the Sleep, I didn't like it that much, but I continued playing it anyway. It wasn't until the middle of the game (the forest part) that I started getting into it.What's brilliant about this game is that you don't know if the toddler is just having a nightmare or he's actually living it! You suddenly find yourself in a twisted reality while you're looking for your mom, who is nowhere to be seen. You don't know if something took her or fs she's still alive. Also, you have a creepy talking bear guiding you to your death. I actually didn't expect that ending, it's an interesting mature twist I didn't see coming.  It gives it a whole different meaning to the game, and makes you want to play it all over again to get all the references/hints you didn't at first (but that's just me, you might not want to play this game twice). I wanted more to the story, a more conclusive ending, but it was okay I guess.That's why I recommend this game. I love misleading storylines. It's a very short game, but it's worth it if you don't mind solving puzzles and avoiding shadowy figures. Also, the atmosphere is kind of creepy, which I love.I'll rate it 8/10 because I didn't expect the ending, and I screamed like a baby twice."

Among The Sleep is a refreshing change to the usual games we all have. Not only does this one throw you into the world of a 2 year old, it shows you just how a child may view the world and the life around him in a very unique way.This game plays it's horror cards perfectly as it slowly reveals the child's life in a very dark and disturbing way. You start off in a world full of colour and brightness - how a child's view should be - but this quickly changes to the darkness that a child should never have to experience.There are simple challenges that compliment how a child may solve it and this in no way makes the game silly or frustrating. Everything works in perfect unison. Even the environment itself as you navigate really makes you feel so small in the big wide world you woddle around in. Speaking of woddling, the developers really captured the movements/sounds/actions of a 2 year old child.Unfortunately there are some issues in this game. You may find a few bugs and glitches as you progress, even to the point where you get stuck and cannot move. I was able to wiggle myself out of any areas I got glitched/stuck into. Be aware the saving function in the game does NOT save your location, only what you've collected and the chapter you're up to. If you exit out of the game you will start back at the beginning of the chapter.Nearing the end of this game I really craved familiarity and pretty colours and brightness. Having delved into this poor child's dark life for so long I couldn't wait to get out of it and see what I saw at the beginning. Overall a brilliant game in its portrayal, message, story and feeling. It is a short game but honestly take your time and really explore and enjoy."

Literally terrified...I do not know why I put myself through them. With this being said my review on a horror game may not be accurate representation for most seasoned horror gamers...I found this game very good however, because you can not fight back. You are a helpless child who can barely walk...and you have to crawl if you wanna move fast. It is dark in most places with flickering lights, which helps generate a nice spooky atmosphere. The controls are fairly simple and easy to get used to, although you will find yourself getting stuck on things at times, and when you open doors that swing towards you it can get awkward as you accidently push it closed again if you are too close, which I am telling you just scares you even more when you are desperate to hide :DOverally I would rate this game 7/10 for game play, and 9/10 for story...because it has a very sad climax, but really it is left to you to piece things together as you are a 2 year old after all!Lovely addition of your imagiinery friend...thought the idea of using him as a light when you hug him was very good!I would reccomend, although only on sale as it is (rightly) quite short...Oh and there is a bonus chapter called the prologue...will update when I have finished that...not sure when I will be brave enough to do it though aha..."

I was enjoying it so much, there is an extra chapter available when you have completed the game, the 'prologue'  can be found at the bottom of the 'select chapter' menu for another ending and an extra 10 - 15 minutes of fun.I will admit the game did jump scare me once quite near the start but I wouldn't describe this as a horror game, although it is very creepy in some parts there really isn't much threatening you or to stop you from progressing further.Teddy is the real star, I will be happily playing again just to hug this little furball!Overall I really enjoyed playing this game, I didn't know what to expect from it. For me, it just looked interesting and sat on my wishlist for a while, but I am glad I bought it.Only bad thing really is the fact that its over priced.• Story: 8/10• Characters: 8/10• GamePlay: 7/10• Graphics: 6/10• Sound: 9/10• Music: 7/10• Length: 4/10• Replay Value: 5/10• Final Score: 7/10"

,Recommended,250620,31307965,Posted: 22 April,all,oliverklee,"This is a first-person survival horror game from the perspective of a two-year old toddler. It's quite short (2.5-5 hours) and relatively easy.If you liked Ammesia: The Dark Descent, you will like this disturbing game.It provides a very intense, dark atmosphere with relative simple, but nice graphics and great music. Playing as a 2-year old brings a unique touch to the game both in the way you move as well as how you can interact with the environment.The only downsides are the clunky controls and some glitches in the graphics, the physics and the sound. In addition, the save points are too far away (while the respawn points are okay). So dying is not a problem, but if you plan to play this game in more than one session, I recommend stopping a session right after you've reached a new chapter.Play this game for experiencing the atmosphere. Don't play it as a challenge or to beat it."

,Recommended,250620,18204459,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,PsychoDelicBoulevard,"Among the Sleep is about a little boy trying to piece clues together to find his mother after she mysteriously dissapears. Through out the game you see the type of character the little boys mother is. You face her demons, and find the sweet memories of her throughout the game [No, I have not spoiled the ending]. The game has a eerie atmosphere to it where you're kind of hesitant to open the next door or crawl into another room, so you etch your way slowly in. It is suspense-full with an easy to follow story line It is not too self explanatory but once in a blue moon there will be some sort of a guide. I would very much so like to see a part  two to this game, that starts where this one ends."

I do recommend this game if you can handle storytelling that goes to some very real places. I myself cannot, and I cannot recommend this to anyone that is a fan of horror games like Amnesia where you cannot defend yourself, and the story is left a little more ambiguous as to certain characters motivations or realities they live in.[SPOILER ALERT](for the first 5 minutes of the game)This game is very clear on who the characters are and the story takes place in real life. This shouldn't be a shock to anyone with a little foresight and a general grasp on storytelling techniques. I saw this coming from the beginning of the game when the creepy teddy bear is nice to you. I won't say any more on the story bc if you want to play the game you should get it on a sale and play through it. It took me less than two hours and I am very dissatisfied. Not with the storytelling as it was adequate in every regard there, and even the gameplay wasn't too bad, there are no puzzles, only minor platforming and pixel hunting for small objects in moderate sized play areas. So if you like stories that get ""real"", buy this game and play it.IF however you are looking for more scares like Amnesia with ambiguous and sometimes creepy lore, look elsewhere."

76561198165664626,Recommended,250620,33862166,Posted: 28 July,all,Rebecca Sensecal,"This was an atmospheric game that is well worth playing. I had a few frustrations with the controls and the saving system, I played on a gaming laptop, with just a touchpad and no mouse. Mostly, the controls were okay, but there were a few places where you have to wind things and it took me a while to work out how to do that on my touchpad (for anyone else having the same trouble: hold down the left touchpad button and then draw circles on the touchpad, rather than the more expected swiping in the direction you want to wind). There were also a couple of times where I needed to throw items, but there was no linked key. I had to come out of the game and edit the controls before I could throw anything.I was also confused by the saves. Every time I picked up a drawing, it said my game was saving. And if I died, I seemed to go back to set check-points. But if I exited the game part way through a chapter, I didn't re-enter either at my most recently collected drawing or at somewhere that had been a check-point after dying. Instead, I seemed to wind up back at the start of a chapter, which was a bit frustrating. As others have mentioned, this would probably have been best played in a single gaming session, but I had to play in relatively short bursts as there are lots of swaying movements and flickering lights and it did make me feel rather nauseated at times!However, the game itself looks amazing and is genuinely creepy at times. You quickly learn to make yourself inconspicious but I may have spent rather more time hiding under bookcases than I strictly needed to. I would have been disapppointed with the amount of game that's here if I'd paid full price, but I picked it up for less than £4 and would recommend this game highly for that."

76561198026662084,Recommended,250620,34580336,Posted: 29 August,all,InDIGnation,"Judged solely from a gameplay perspective, Among the Sleep isn’t especially remarkable: a first-person survival horror game with simple puzzle-solving elements (even making use of a similar mouse-click interface found in Frictional titles) and somewhat simplistic monster chases. Where this quirky game really excels is the execution of its unique storyline.You’re placed in the teeny shoes of a two-year-old toddler who must search for his mother after being thrust into a series of vivid dreamscapes that all encompass some warped vision of childhood memories and fears. Everything in the world seems massive and imposing - even the coats found hanging in wardrobes bear a resemblance to domineering adults in the eyes of a frightened and confused child. This exaggerated verticality isn’t something you’ll likely consciously notice at first, but it’s a subtly effective way of making the world feel hostile and unfamiliar. The Unity-powered visuals won’t win any awards for technical prowess, but the art and sound design do an excellent job at building the atmosphere.But while the level design does a decent job at establishing the atmosphere, it does a much poorer job of giving it any significant payoff. There are only a handful of monster encounters in the course of the story, and it’s unlikely you’ll find them particularly scary if you’ve played any survival horror games before. Their behaviour is so heavily scripted and lacking in challenge that most people will find sneaking past them to be a cakewalk (In my case, I didn’t end up dying once). There is an argument to be had that making a horror game too difficult can result in something more frustrating than scary. At the same time though, when there’s no tangible threat to the player during these moments, it’s hard for me to really take the monster chases seriously - particularly when I once ran the wrong way and was able to walk right past one without it seeming to notice.The story however, is something I haven’t seen done before in a video game -the portrayal of an abusive relationship as seen through the eyes of a young child. You eventually learn that the environments aren’t merely spooky dreamscapes, but represent the fears and anxieties of this small lad’s mind as he struggles to comprehend the emotional torment going on around him. Among the Sleep pulls this off surprisingly well without having to resort to explicit images or gratuitous violence - instead, we’re able to understand this childhood fear through symbolism and subtle environmental cues. It’s a shame that the conclusion feels rather abrupt and ends on a slightly rushed note, but the game’s short three-hour length at least means that the story never feels padded or overstretched.Taken as a whole, Among the Sleep is a somewhat variable survival horror experience - it’s gameplay, while intuitive enough, doesn’t really do enough to connect the player the the narrative itself, which I suspect might lead some people to label the game as little more than a walking simulator. Despite this, the story Krillbite has conjured up, while not always coherent, is unique and interesting.TL:DR: If you’re looking for a substantial gameplay experience, then you might be better off with one of Among the Sleep’s many horror contemporaries. If you’re looking for something a little special, then this is still worth picking up on the cheap."

Whether you're running from a scary tree lady, hiding under shelves and desks, or simply walking through the house at night passing by empty bottles of alcohol and hearing your mother crying in the background. The story can be hard to catch, but if you're looking for it, it's an incredibly well told one.  I would definitely recommend this game. It's a little short, but the story is so definitely worth it."

Among the Sleep is no different but they are justified by its unique premise: You play a two year old toddler... and everything and everybody is terrifying to a baby. The game does a good job of simulating that feeling of helplessness and fear of what you cannot understand that I'm sure every kid that age feels. The ending was also heavy. Not to spoil anything, but your heart will sink when you realize what every scary, incomprehensible thing the child was imagining represented in real life. Two immersive thumbs up."

The game is worth its money, the end will leave a mark, it did on me anyway.I have read some negative reviews and i think they got dissapointed at the game just because they thought it would be the best game ever and that made them think it was bad when its not.. So im just saying this.. i payed 15€ for this, it was worth every penny! But as i said, dont think this will the best experience, just play it and i think you will like it or even love it.. or yes maybe even you will dislike but then its because this is not your kind of game and dont give it a thumbs down just because you didnt like it, give it a thumbs down if you normally like these kind of games.Thanks for reading WHOLE this review and not just some parts!"
