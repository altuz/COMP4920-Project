,Recommended,250640,11296760,"Posted: 17 July, 2014",all,Mekh,"Croixleur Sigmais an arcade hack n slash featuring two adorable main characters namedLucreziaandFrancesca.I would strongly recommend a controller for this game. And locking the game to 60 fps in the configuration tool to avoid breaking the game completely.(Very high fps speeds the game up, making it impossible to play.)Although the game is very short it has a ton of replay value with all the different game modes, which are:Story Mode,Arcade Mode,Score Attack,Survival, 30 different challenges and an extraBonus Modethat unlocks after you complete the Story Mode under a certain time with each character.The main focus of this game is to kill every enemy in each of the levels until you advance to the next level, while doing it as fast and efficiently as possible to get the best time possible. Every level also increases the difficulty slightly with tougher monsters, and every 5 levels they throw a boss creature into the mix as well.Different modessuch asScore Attackworks a little differently, you get 3 minutes to achieve the highest score possible.Survivalis exactly what you would expect, survive for as long as possible and kill as many enemies as you can.Arcade Modegives you the option to play through the Story Mode levels without any story scenes for nonstop killing.And finallyBonus Mode, a continuation of the story with more levels and tougher enemies.While playing through Story Mode you will unlock more weapons, each with different stats and special attacks. Think of each weapon as a different move, you can hold up to 4 weapons at a time to build any combo you would like. Oh and the more you use a weapon the higher level it becomes!The graphics may not be the most impressive but I think it fits the game very well. The gameplay however is amazing, it made me want to get better and improve after every time I fell in battle and lost some unnecessary time. While the soundtrack did not blow me away I think it accompanies the gameplay really well.I had a lot of fun trying to complete all the achievements, it added many extra hours to the game as well as giving me some goals to achieve while playing.If you are in it only for the story (which is not much) then this game is probably not for you. However, if you are looking to complete most of the achievements in the game and wondering how long it would take, expect around 12 hours. That is how long it took me to finish everything.It's a pretty solid game, so if it looks interesting to you I would definitely recommend picking it up!"

How do you do that? Of course you kill goblins, flying eyes, huge demons, paladins and DRAGONS a la fast paced Hack 'n' Slash gameplay with your multitude of weapons that you acquire from progressing in said tower.Jokes on you, the story doesn't matter at all in this game, it's the gameplay.Just like any other hack and slash game you must whack mobs as fast as you can (or as stylishly possible if you think you're in Devil May Cry) and rack up points while you avoid dying. It's quick and it's fun.Controls are simple, you have an attack button, a jump button, dash and an invicibility special. They all do exactly what it says on the tin. There are no variations to basic attacks but the weapons you obtain all have different skills that you can combine in your 4 weapon slots to create cool and/or devastating combos.Pretty OK replay value thanks to various weapons in other areas not visited before, challenges, a score attack mode and a survival mode.Controller is recommended.[/b]tl;dr lesbian swordswomen racing to the top of a tower with fast paced combat that's both kawaii and kakkoi10/10 would recommend to any bored weeaboo or hack and slash player, heck, any bored player"
,Recommended,250640,13973809,"Posted: 13 January, 2015",all,pepsimanvsjoe,"PLOT: Lucrezia wants to take a bath with Francesca. Franny is all ""NO WAY IN HELL"" and runs off to a massive tower(paging Dr. Freud). Luc has to fight through a dozen or so floors of goblins, flying eyeballs, knights in shining armor, and huge beasts to drag Fran's sorry butt into the tub.Okay I forgot the actual plot to this game. I assure you all that there is one and it's kinda-sorta-quasi-serious. But who cares about that nonsense? This is a supplemental-arcade-arena-slashemup. If you have less than 15 minutes to spare you can complete a play-through of this game. Yes, this game is a short one, but it's pretty sweet. There are no crazy mission designs, no escorting, no stealth, nothing but just slashing through hundreds of generic foes and grabbing coins.Before the game starts you decide on your arsenal. There are 10 weapons per gal and they all have their own special moves. Basically you want a combination of weapons that suit your play-style. Special moves can be chained for more damage, and some are only effective in mid-air, or as anti-air (gotta account for the flying eyes). Don't fuss over your style rating though, this game rewards speed and efficiency above everything else. Yellow enemies drop in a single hit, blues go down in three, and reds take 4+. Once you memorize the basics all you have to worry about is dashing around and mopping everything up.There are a variety of modes, but variety is a rather strong word when it comes to Croixleur.Story - Kill Everything As Fast As Possible. Lots of plot and talks about baths.Time Attack - KEAFAP in 3 minutesSurvival - KEAFA you want. Expect to see huge crowds of enemies.Challenge - Definitely KEAFAP.Bonus - This is the epilogue. Luc & Fran team up to bring the hurt on slightly tougher enemies. Don't forget to KEAFAP.For the most part Croixleur Sigma is a fast-paced and satisfying slasher. The controls are fluid enough and it's fun zipping around shredding everything. However there are some issues that I have with the game.Certain moves have weak properties. One of the specials Luc can perform is a downward stab that causes a large shockwave. However, that shockwave is mostly for looks and only hits enemies that are practically under Luc. This tends to be the case with a number of special moves. They look like they should hit because you see the flashy trails and pretty lights connect with enemies, but instead they miss completely. It's...well not really that big an issue. I mean, it's not like it's inconsistent or anything. It would be much worse if the moves hit only some of the time.Anti-cooperative play. When Luc & Fran team up, it spells trouble...for Luc & Fran. You have to give your BFF plenty of breathing space or she will hit you with her regular and special attacks (and vice-versa). This doesn't do any damage, but it will stun you, and can throw your rhythm off as well as waste time. Maybe the developer thought it would be too easy if this wasn't the case. Luc & Fran could just throw those special moves out constantly and be a whirling dervish of destruction. I disagree. Croixleur Sigma plays up the bestest buddies element, but then implements a design-decision that causes real-world friends to fight? That is a definite head-scratcher. Also during the bonus mode the game only ends when player 1 dies. Player 2 can die as many times as they like. This is something I abused for the cheap final battle.Croixleur Sigma is like I said, a supplemental game. You play this title alongside your ""main"" game, or when you absolutely must play something, and don't have much time. It's not a deep game though, not even in terms of game-design depth. If Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae complements games like Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Rising, this game is best played alongside Dynasty Warriors. When you want a dumb 5-minute slashathon, but don't want to run around huge maps and listen to a bunch of talk about Three Kingdoms and whatever whatever, then play this game."

,Not Recommended,250640,12769060,"Posted: 3 November, 2014",all,DEATH,"The question we must ask when buying a game like this is how much value are we getting for our money? The answer to that is, a 10 minute Story mode. It will than take about 3 minutes to complete all the ""challenges"" and than another 3 minutes to do a run through Score Attack mode. After that all there is to do is play Survival Mode over and over again and there really isn't much fun in that.There is hardly much of a game here and for the full price of $8 this is pretty pathetic. You can experience the game in it's entirety in less than 20 minutes. About 3 standard enemy types and 3 boss types, all of which can be killed individually in less than 5 seconds. This is probably the easiest arena fighter i've played before.Oh and one more thing, Local Co-op? I don't think so. The current steam version does not contain the required Setup.exe to set the controls for Player 2, so without that you cannot play Co-op. If you manage to track down that file (which I did) you can experience Survival Mode and Score Attack mode with another player, as they walk off the screen or kill you with their special attacks.You are much better off buying any other game, as there are a lot of better action games for the same price or less. Hell there are even tons of better free games. Don't waste your money on this. I would say time but even if you buy it, you won't be spending much time with it anyway.It's unfortunate though, the combat system is solid and the assets are nice, there could've been a fun game here if it tried but with such an insultingly small amount of content, this is shorter than most demo's."

In terms of combat, I'd say its qualifying to be a casual hack and slash, worth the money it costs.Little summary:> The story is of two girls going through examination in a tower, where they need to fight against monsters and from time to time with each other. During gameplay you unlock multiple different weapons and in total two playable characters. Multiple different stages in high score braking session and story mode. I personally recommend it, as it has its niche, that makes it nice, or is it just me being loli fan. :D"

,Recommended,250640,32401109,Posted: 13 June,all,Bach,"When I bought this game I didn't really know what to expect. I like anime, that's one of the main reasons I bought it, and also because I know that sometimes one can find hidden gems if searched correctly. This was one of those occasions. ""Are you saying that this game is so good as to consider it a hidden gem?"" Yes, at least it is for me. For a long time I was keeping an eye on this game, seeing the reviews it had. It always caught my eye since it was one of the first Japanese games of its kind that was on Steam, shortly before the boom happened. It wasn't normal to see Japanese indie hack 'n' slash games in those times. Before going to the main points I'd like to mention a few things related to the technical section:It's highly recommended that you play with joystick, although that applies to almost all hack 'n' slash. The game doesn't have many screen resolutions available so I at least had to play in a different resolution to the one I have and without full screen, although that didn't bother me at all. There are also game modes in which too many enemies appear, which causes that when killing them the game is slowed down by the amount of elements that are in screen. Now, let's begin.--Plot--The plot isn't very surprising, in fact it is quite short, about 20 minutes max. The trick here is that you won't be able to finish the story at first. If you get to play and finish it for the first time, I recommend that you check your ""collection"" to see the clues. The endings of the story also vary depending on whether we win or lose, and the time. Despite the short of the story, I can say that it's entertaining, why? The characters. Lucrezia and Francesca are really adorable. Both have distinct and very defined personalities, and although both may seem very different it's noticeable that the relationship between them is very deep. They really caught me at this point, how am I going to forget the cheerful and nice Luc, or the mature and tender Fran? Keep in mind that this was achieved by a game whose story lasts only 20 minutes, which shows how well written the characters are.--Gameplay--As I mentioned earlier, Croixleur Sigma is a Hack 'n' Slash. In this case, it's one of those easy to play but difficult to master game, maybe that's why I like it so much, since I don't have much experience with these types of games. Starting with the menu, when you press ""Game Start"" you'll realize that there aren't many options, but don't worry because the other game modes will be unlocked as you complete the game. When you enter the arena you'll see that there are 4 slots but only one has a weapon, this is because you'll unlock more weapons as you advance. All weapons have the same basic attack, their peculiarities are in their special attacks. Each weapon of each character has a different special attack, these special attacks are vital if you want to finish the game fast. When you kill enemies you'll notice that they drop coins, these coins serve to charge the ""Invincible Attack"", which is a special attack that makes you immortal for a brief moment. You start with 3 of these. I stopped using them over time given that they take a lot of time, but it's not a bad idea to use them in extra modes when there are hundreds of enemies surrounding you. The key to the game is to be fast, very fast, and also know how to concentrate your attacks. Only then will you complete the game at %100, which, as you can see in my playtime, can take hours. This is because the latest achievements are incredibly difficult to obtain. Of the 15 hours you can see in my playtime, 1/4 of that was dedicated to getting the last 5 achievements. If you are not achievement hunters then it is fine, but those who are prepare to suffer because the game in the end becomes very-very-very difficult and frustrating.--Visuals--As you can see, the game is quite colorful. Personally I think that the artistic style is successful, it doesn't have the latest technology in realtime shadows or something like that but I quite like it, although this version could make use of some polishing. An example is that the models of the characters don't move their mouths, unlike in the PS4/PS Vita version. This version doesn't compare to the PS4/PS Vita version, released 1 year later, which has completely redesigned visuals. On the other hand, the menus are simple in design and easy to navigate. The scenarios aren't very varied because they are all the same but with different designs, although this didn't bother me much since I was more concentrated playing.--Music & Sound--The music of Croixleur Sigma is quite good and is well used in the game sections either in the menu, during the game or when we face the bosses. Something important is that the dynamics of the game prevent the same music to repeat every so often, so it doesn't tire or frustrate. I found the music so good that I'm going to buy the OST when I can. The voices are not far behind. Yes, I didn't mention it before but the game has voice actors, and it's simply a delight to the ears as they do a very good job in their respective roles. As for the sound effects, I think they are well employed and blend seamlessly with the ambience and theme of the game.In conclusion, do I recommend this game? Of course! Since this game is aimed at a very specific niche, if you have the slightest interest in it I recommend it. It was the same with me and I don't regret having bought it. I think its price is more than enough for what it offers. In addition to all this, Croixleur Sigma has given me the confidence to buy more Japanese indie games, since I could find more hidden gems like this. Although if you can, I recommend that you buy the PS4/PS Vita version, it overcomes in several the Steam version.My rating is:8.0 / Very Good."

It's the sort of game that's easy to learn and hard to master, offering a perfect difficulty curve.You face various sets of enemies coming in continuous waves in a circular arena, and the main draw here is to become increasingly more efficient at dispatching them faster and faster. There's a 15 minute time limit to finish the main story, which makes sure the game never becomes tiresome and repetitive. Each runthrough is quick and challenges you to surpass your previous record.There are also a few extra game modes and various weapons (and a character) to unlock to help keep the experience fresh.Definitely recommended."

It takes a little while to get used to using the ability system while in an actual fight, but when you actually learn to perform combos with them, you'll be really glad that you did.I'll admit that I don't play a huge amount of these kind of games, but I felt the game was fair without being over-easy on the difficulty curve, and the mixture of dashing and attacking was fast, fluid, and pretty damn fun. The game even manages to work in the classic 'Vergil'/rival/worthy opponent fight.The story is pretty light on the ground, but what's there is good: the characters are likeable, the dialogue is actually really well translated, and the banter the two heroines share is amusing to no end*. I actually would really like to explore and see this sort of world the game is based in, if only because the dialogue suggests something greater than the game's total sum is going on outside of the game's events.There's also quite a few modes to play around in, so even if the story is pretty quick to go, there's a decent amount of replayability, even if highscores and leaderboards aren't your cup of tea.Over all, an enjoyable hack and slash which is pretty noob-friendly, with an amusing story and interesting setting, even if the former is light and the ground and we only get a few hints at the later. If you can, pick it up and see if there's anything for you in there.*There's also some sub-text in there (which becomes more or less just text by the end), so if you were looking for that kind of thing..."

A gamepad (I used an XBox 360 controller) is absolutely essential.A fairly short story is bulked up by a Bonus mode (you and AI vs. more powerful enemies) and a Challenge mode which can be pretty frustrating if the last two enemies on a map are on opposite sides.Resolution options are limited, to the point where anyone with exotic graphics setups would be best served running the game in a window. Music is pretty good, although the sound effects can get repetitive rather quickly.All in all, quite an enjoyable game overall if you're not into the more complex beat-'em-ups which require encyclopaedic knowledge of advanced combos to get anywhere reasonable.Recommended."
,Not Recommended,250640,17482709,"Posted: 10 August, 2015",all,N312,"Croixleur Sigma is the game that inspired me to use the new Steam refund function, and with a 15 minute story mode, it was a decision I think most people can arrive at quickly.As far as technical quality goes, it’s really not great, despite its simplicity. Supporting 1600 x 900 resolution but only allowing fullscreen in a smaller or larger size seemed like an arbitrary limitation, though I doubt I would have played in 1600 x 900 anyway, as when i tried to play it windowed, no 3D assets at all loaded. The 2D UI would appear on screen, sure, but the actual game was just black. Full screen in non native resolutions didn’t go over so well when using a gamepad (which they explicitly recommended) as the analog controls were all wonked up. So I had settle for windowed mode on a non-native resolution because the other options straight up did not work. Even if you select the option to unlock the FPS, it stays locked 60; that’s not really a huge issue but it does serve to show how much the developers even cared about technical quality. Honestly I was underwhelmed by this game before I even played. And yet still, I played:When I got into the actual game, they tried to set up some kind of irrelevant narrative, I’m guessing it’s “Because that’s what real games do, r-right guys?” Instead they only raise more questions. The kingdom is ruled by a Queen who has two constituencies: the knights and the aristocrats, but it’s not really explained what the importance of that is. They throw in some poem about the struggle between the two constituencies but that ends up just being some casual contest that exists just because. The aristocrats are warriors despite the fact that those are usually the last people to ever fight in any kind of battle, and they go to their own training academies to become better fighters. The knights basically do the same, but maybe they have to earn their way in? I’m not sure, they never really say. The two characters are of different class but apparently still bathed together as children and assuming that was important dialogue and not just some♥♥♥♥♥♥tier weeb-bait trite, it felt like they were implying knights were treated the same as aristocrats, so, why the need for two classes anyway? If knights prove their worth with combat prowess, and are held to the same training standards as aristocrats, then why even conscript aristocrats into the academy to begin with when you’ll just end up wasting time training a bunch of people that don’t actually want to be trained. Seems kind of dumb. But the developers didn’t seem to care about the writing either, so I guess we shouldn’t either. I’m just saying, if you maybe did care about writing, there’s nothing of merit in this game at all in those regards, and I could go on about that even longer.The game throws in a bunch of weapons with different special attacks, but the basic attacks are all the same. considering the game was easily beatable without the use of any special attacks, I have to question their importance. Most of them seem like extra-strong hits which would basically just kill your combo score so there’s no point in using them if you’re trying to get a high score (which is all there is to do in this game, mind you). You’re better off saving your MP for the dash anyway because it lets you get the game over with even easier, especially the final boss: just let it knock you into the air and you can just dash and attack up there and land hits on him without having to come back down, and effectively dodge all of his attacks without even trying. It’s really not that competent. Somehow spending $4 on this seems like too much for what I got, what with the levels repeating and all. The enemies got harder, as in they got more HP and that’s it, and they even managed to do that incompetently: instead of making enemies of the same strength uniform in color, they just gave random colors to whatever they felt like: purple, yellow, black, red--it was hard to tell what an enemy’s strength was based on that because there was no consistency to the color coding between enemies at all.Yeah basically this game is a waste of time. Just don’t bother."

The voice acting is surprisingly decent if you don't mind Japanese voices. The graphics are reminiscent of a PS2 game, but runs very well at 60 fps.With all the other stuff out of the way, I can get to the gameplay. First off, the best way to judge if you like the sort of game is simply to download the demo. It's a small download, and even if the demo gives you a minute of gameplay, you should quickly decide if you like it.A lot of people compare this to Devil May Cry, but it feels much more like Dynasty warriors with a rapid dodge/dash button. The enemy AI is weak, and similar to that of a Dynasty Warriors. You have a generic invincibility attack to bust out when needed. Finally, you collect swords as you play. Equipping them leads to different abilities, and the ability to form your own combos, as many of the abilities are seamlessly linkable. Once again, somewhat similar to a character's abilities in a Dynasty Warriors game. The dodge button allows people to zip around the confined arenas, and really speed up the game. It ends up feeling like a bit of a mix between Dynasty Warriors, and Devil May Cry, although obviously the game doesn't have near the production value of either.The game has a bunch of different modes, arcade/story are by the far the most enjoyable. Challenge mode is a joke and can often be won without using anything but autoattack and dodge/dash. You will beat the story mode in under 15 minutes, but getting the different swords, leveling them(which doesn't seem to do much), and getting the achievements has been a lot of fun. The combat just feels fluid and satisfying. You'll feel super powerful, extremely quick, but that's the point. There seems to be an extremely low skill cap in the game, which also makes me wary to compare it to Devil May Cry. All in all though, it's a genuinely fun game.TLDR: Try the demo, or watch a video of the gameplay. There's not much hidden, and what you see is what you get."

It doesn't live up anywhere near to that comparison.The controls feel clunky at times, the depth of combat styles is nonexistend (you have 4 skills which you can swap out).The story mode takes about 10 minutes to finish, no joke. There's even an achievement for that.The game has very few different opponents (some are even recolors of others) and arenas are exactly the same stage but with different colors which makes it very repetitive.Overall a game that COULD have been fun if it had a real story and slightly more polished controls /camerahandling.I sadly can't recommand it, even though I think that it could have potential if it wasn't a finished fullrelease."

The gameplay is always fun even if it's an extremely short and easy game but it's okay since there are some challenges i guess.But then this version does not have the other new 2 extra characters...  So do not be fooled thinking the steam version is the best version out.I played one hour here and unlocked all there is to unlock has it is. Unless they update the version to it's latest with all 4 characters + some new achievement i cannot recommand this... Not even when in a special offer. Unless it goes down to 1$ then go for it.1$ for 1hour of fun sounds fair enough.I will change my point of view if they ever update or add a DLC so we get all the costumization stuff and the new characters from the latest version of the game.

Plays fast and furious with great response from controllers. Cute girl characters who bathe together, loving it.There are many modes, weapons and secrets to unlock. Well done art, coin collecting feels great, stats are kept and you can ditch out anytime with all info saved."

This is intentional, and part of the game's scoring.The story isn't anything you'll really resolve, nor is it something that'll win writing award, but it sets the tone of the game and works well enough. I admittedly have a weakness for the voice cast, so I'll leave it at that. The overall tone is pretty cute.The visuals are good for the 2 girls, but the enemy designs are a little on the bland side. The game is also pretty easy unless you're going for high scores, and the combat system starts simple, but abit of knowhow allows you to get gloriously long combos and stomping through enemies with narry a scratch.The achievement system in it is silly, since it requires you to unlock the ones preceeding it in order to get a given achievement, even if you've basically qualified for it repeatedly in the process of unlocking those.Unfortunately, the Steam Cloud support doesn't actually work at all, so you'll need to take your save with you manually.If you have some change lying around, it's not a bad game to lose an afternoon or two to."

A nice time waster.However: Issues with 7.1 surround. Meaning muted music. Not a huge deal but takes away from it. No, there are no other options (turning down the music) . Heavy overdrive static in your right ear- enough to make you go deaf. Devs need to address this."
,Recommended,250640,11734647,"Posted: 15 August, 2014",all,Ninja_Donut,"Although it can get boring quickly, there are a good couple hours of gameplay in there. The combat is fast and fluid, and it may be slightly button smashing but there is definitely some skill required for this game. The game is fast paced and fun while the controls are fairly simple and easy to comprehend. I'd give this game a 7/10, it would have gotten a higher score if it wasn't so short, but it's still worth the purchase."
