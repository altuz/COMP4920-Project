If you haven't completed all animation sequences down to the pixel, you are NOT allowed to jump or turn.  That means you can't let go of the left button and immediately hold down right and expect to turn.  You won't.  In fact, if you immediately press right after holding left, the game may sometimes glitch and keep making you walk left.Same thing with jumping.  If your character is, for any reason, in the middle of standard movement - you will NOT be able to jump.  Yes, that does mean that if you are being pushed forward by an enemy, you CANNOT JUMP.  In certain situations this very much seems to be a bug.  Now, I admit, I'm not the best player, but 1 to 2 out of every 5 deaths feels like I was cheated.This is a cute game, though, and if you are able to drop a gamepad and walk away from a cheated death, then you can deal with this game."

The movement is fast and the controls are really sharp (takes a bit to get used to at first) but works well since it has some pretty hardcore platforming challenges. The sound track is amazingly well done.

The game is very good in my opinion and honestly, made me think I was playing a type of Metroid game, has quite a lot of similarities with Metroid, achievements/challenges for beating the game in a certain time with having all items collected, items/health to be found scattered in obvious and secret areas, bosses that are needed to beat to obtain items to open the next path, even a different suit that is purple and makes you stronger and take less damage, just like the Gravity Suit. When I had gone a few rooms to the right, I instanly thought of a similarity to Brinstar on Metroid Zero Mission, Dark King's Lair reminded me of the depths of Norfair from Zero Mission and there is even one dungeon further on in the game that will reminded you of Metroid games and Tourain (you'll know when you get there.) But enough about comparing this to Metroid, this game is hard at times as some of the bosses can be tricky the first time you fight them and you will need some quick reflixes on certain areas of the game. Overall it's not bad at all, didn't think it would be as enjoyable as it is. Controls weren't hard to get used to, lots of items to collect, soundtrack was done pretty good, nice boss battles that can be difficult or easy depending on how you go about the game and what items you have, another character to play as once you beat the game with her own story as well. Achievements in this game are quite the challenge on some of them, but that's what makes the game better, so if you're the type of person who likes challenges or going for harder achievements like me, then this will be perfect for you. I will say though, this game is going to bring back the older days with me, going back to speed runs which I haven't done in a long time. Amazing game, very enjoyable and very satisfied with my purchase."

Controls very well, with keyboard or with the controller. Time control is a very good feature that works well. So many secrets too! You'll have to play a lot if you want to get them all.

However, it's very hard, so if you're more of a casual player you might want to download the demo first to see if it's too much for you. Also, while the new music isn't really that bad on its own, you MIGHT want to change the soundtrack to the original in the options menu; it's a whole new experience with the old music because it actually fits to the environment incredibly well, which is something the arranged versions don't do, and it also feels classic because it uses Yamaha XG as its synth, which helps in a game with this style. Of course, some music like the intro and the first area themes are changed quite a bit (probably because of copyright stuff), but it isn't too much of a problem.Also, for those who are complaining about the controls: Git gud.

This could and should be a much more fun game if the controls were reworked, as well as if display modes and widescreen were ever going to be fixed. I hear there's been a lot of improvements and some added content with the PS4/Vita versions, so I'd probably suggest you get one of those versions first if you have access to the platforms.

I dont like using the term ""metroidvania,"" but that is preciesely how this game functions. It feels like it was developed during the SNES/Genesis era, which makes me happy. (Slight digression: this is as opposed to the many indie games out there today which use sprite-art and chip-tune sound effects, but dont feel like retro games in the slightest.)I will admit, I have not yet finished the game as of writing this review.

As you navigate through the labyrinth, you have to fight enemies, get through obstacles and puzzles, fight bosses and find items to power up and unlock new places to go to.The game is a pretty solid metroidvania game. It rarely has a ""What do i do next?"" moment. It has no indicators as to where to go next, but the items and minimap make most of these things clear. The music is great. I liked both the original and remixed soundtrack. The game is propperly translated, which allows non-japanese players to join in on the nonsensical humor this game provides.Bunny Must Die also features an unlockable second character, with her own story and gameplay mechanics, doubling the fun of this game. The story of Bunny and this other character are sequels, and explains some mysteries in Bunny her storyline. It also has some room for skipping/sequence breaking, adding some replay value for hardcore gamers. Doing so will cause certain events to act different as well (like the 1st boss getting a different dialogue and becoming more difficult).Unlike regular metroidvania games, Bunny Must Die also introduces some elements of bullet hell shooters. People who played the Gundemonium series will recognize some elements that have been copied from the other games. These extra elements make this game quite difficult on certain points. Although I wouldn't label it as insanely difficult, the game gets very tough at some later points in the game."

76561198077657510,Not Recommended,250660,10548007,"Posted: 19 June, 2014",all,star_foxy,"Currently I am still attempting to finish this game, but I figured I would give my two cents.If you're looking for a ""Metroid-Vania"" style game, this game is probably for you. It is a platforming game where you explore different areas. Collecting power-ups such as dashing or wall-jumping opens up new areas of the game. Collecting different sub-weapons allows you to deal with enemies and bosses. You also have the ability to control time. You have to figure out how to progress to new areas using a combination of these elements. The puzzles that you have to solve are well thought out and give you a great sense of accomplishment once you figure them out. The game also has hidden areas and secrets that encourage players to look at every nook and cranny of the game, further extending gameplay. Enemies and bosses have a lot of charm to them despite the anime look.Unfortunately all of these great things about the game are hampered by really bad controls. I practically have a laundry list of all the problems with the controls. The following talks about my experience using a controller:-Jumping: If you are moving on the ground and then jump at the same time, you do a spin jump. When you make this jump, the height of your jump is fixed. On the other hand, if you are standing still and then jump, you can control the height of the jump and can actually jump higher than a spin jump. This can get irritating because if I'm trying to reach a high platform that is ahead of me, I have to stop, jump, and then move forward.Another problem I have with jumping is the fact that while you are in the air, you can move left or right regardless of the type of jump you perform, but you cannot change the direction you are facing while in the air. This ties in to the next problem I have.-Wall jumping: When you approach a wall you want to jump on, you have to make sure that you are facing the wall when you are in the air. If you accidently fall and are trying to recover by jumping off a wall you are not facing, frustration occurs. Another problem that I personally have is that if you press the direction opposite the wall the moment after jumping off said wall, you perform a dash instead of jumping higher. This creates a problem for me because if I'm trying to getting to higher ground between two walls, I have to make sure I'm pressing the correct direction on time and make it to the walls. More often than not I perform a dash instead of jumping higher. I've seen videos of people getting higher by doing wall jumps off the same wall repeatedly, but for the life of me I cannot replicate the technique due to the precision required to perform such a move.-Attacking: With a majority of the weapons, you cannot change directions until the attack animation is done. This applies when the player is on the ground as well as in the air. What makes this inconsistent is the fact that when you are on the ground you can angle your attack upwards or downwards, but if you want to switch between left and right, you have to wait for the attack animation to finish before you can turn. You can jump while attacking but cannot move left or right. I personally feel that auto-fire is being discouraged in the game.-Blocking: This one isn't really such a big deal to me than I first thought. You have to push any direction at the moment before getting hit. I think I would prefer to have this assigned to one of the shoulder buttons instead.This is a very fun and challenging game, and there are a lot of great things going for it. However, if I have to think about the controls all the time as I am playing it, it means that I cannot enjoy all of the other aspects of the game. The controls are inconsistent and need considerable improvement. I understand that there are people who have been able to play the game with these controls, meaning it is not impossible to complete this game 100%. This game requires a lot of practice and precision, I get it. Regardless, I cannot recommend this game unless the controls are changed."
,Not Recommended,250660,7992921,"Posted: 10 December, 2013",all,exitplanetdust,"Bunny Must Die! is a cute metroidvania exponent, as we call this genre today, but you sensibly consider it a Metroid clone - design is quite similar to Nintendo's classic title. It is enjoyable for its audiovisual style, but only if you are accustomed to some japanese excesses - the style is bizarre and exaggerated. Even its game design is appreciable. But what ruins everything is its control and collision system. Collisions are very stiff and controls are terribly inaccurate - sometimes you'll work hard to execute some simple movements like to climb down from a platform or to turn your character in the opposite way. This aspect makes the game extremely frustrating and in my opinion destroys all the good the game could have to offer - soon things get very hard, and you won't tolerate all this impreciseness."

Nonetheless, this game has quite a bunch of things that makes you want to play it, even if it's ungodly hard for first timers.~Graphics~This game offer you two sprites graphics for who prefer older graphics or revamped graphics. 16bits and 32bits era. Both have usefulness, since the hud change, and other things. The graphics is well made for a simple platforming game and it's quite pretty!~Gameplay~It's a really fast paced game. You must react to every situation really quick. You can do several stuff after getting the items spreaded throughout the game, like metroid's game. (E.g. Dash Shoes/Red Shoes, would be a similar item for Speed Booster.)  Even if the game is quite harsh in the way you can heal yourself, that fast paced gameplay doesn't get old at all!~Controls~Oh god, they are wonky in someways. It takes a while to get the hang of it. Whenever you do anything, until you land on the ground (if you are on the ground, it's the same too), you have to wait until the character finish her animation to either move around, jump or attack again. As I said and many others, it takes a while to get used to it. They aren't as bad as they seems. Just tricky to get the hold of it. Once you get it, you will be dashing through everything like it's nothing.~Summery~(This game is good. 'Nuff said.)That's what I would like to say in a very short fashion, but I cannot do simple stuff like that, right?Basically, if you like metroid games, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this one. Be prepared to die a lot though. Don't let your rage meter get ahold of yourself. It's normal to die in this game, it was meant this way. Just keep going, and save Bunny!"

A parody of several different mainstream series at once, and a pastiche of the gameplay of those and other, completley unrelated games that should by all rights fall apart entirely, but somehow manages to coalesce into a neat little package of fun. This is a metroidvania in the strictest sense, in that it is a fusion of both Metroid and Castlevania elements -- but on top of this, it adds bullet hell gameplay softened up to playability with Street Fighter III-style parries.Skrubs be warned; this is a HARD game. The controls are weird and take a lot of getting used to, and the level design pulls no punches whatsoever with its difficulty curve. This is not a game that you can just brute-force your way through with sloppy tactics, nor is it a game that you can cheese your way through with outside-the-box thinking.

It's the little things, for example: the slight delay between changing directions and the accompanying automatic camera scroll, fairly easy to get temporarily ""locked"" into a certain direction when attacking, etc.Jumping is a somewhat odd affair. Most platformers will gradually scale your height proportional to how long you hold the button down irrespective what you are doing.In this game, your jump control depends on your current preceding action:Standing Still: Behaves like conventional platformer, you can control height of jumpWalking/Dashing: No control over jump height. Pressing jump always results in highest possible jump, which can be extremely frustrating.Basically, if you're getting this game with the expectation of a precision platformer (like a Meat Boy, They Bleed Pixels, or Super House of Dead Ninjas), you're going to be disappointed. On the other hand, if you treat it like it is, a solid action platformer with controls more akin to rigid-style type games like the old Castlevania games, I think you'll enjoy it for the most part."

The soundtrack is fine, it looks cute and the power ups from what I have seen so far (yeah the controls are so horrible I didn't even bother to finish it) are pretty good. But THE MOST important thing in a platformer is handled really badly here. Trust me you will WISH you had Classic castlevania controls here. Because while yes you can technicly control your jump in mid air (its awkward though) just the slightest amount of momentum will send you in a non stop until you hit a wall or ground fly. This game is really vertical in terms of level design and because of these controls you will either fall down to where you started or slugh through the sections. Attacking is really awkward too. You hold down and rapid fires ok not bad but here is the thing , I guess because the developers wanted to make sure you don't skip their animations (which are detailed yes) , you are not allowed to even TURN AROUND while attacking or until bunny finishes her animation!Don't play this , these controls are just too bad and you WON""T get use to them. At least with old school castlevania the moment you get over the stiff jump you are good to go but with this no thanks."

The speed is varied due to the controls, but the pace is consistent and enjoyable. This game feels more like an old school game from the time when gaming was all about BRUTAL PRACTICE! The dialogue is entertaining, and the weapons are all different and there is enough to satisfy a great number of gamers.

This is both a bit accurate and inaccurate.The controls are NOT impercise, they are high high percision;You can also easily make your character do many things: 'bunny' jump up, foward, and backwards, spin jump, attack up, foward, & diagonally, duck, dash, dash attack.The problem is a number of those manuvers require very percise button presses, and the controls are also setup so that the character will 'commit' to some actions, so you can't quickly cancel it to do another action.This can make the contols feel *unresponsive*, if you do things by refex and get a button press wrong.For those of you who remember, it is similar to the problems in Super Metroid in making a spin vs. regular jump, or in Symphony of the Night and accidentally doing Alucards reverse mini-dash thingy, except a bit more unforgiving.I'm pretty sure it was an intentional choice in how to setup the controls, they want to award percisely controlling the character.Example: Try to turn the character around and do a spin jump (jump and push forward same time), what actually happens is you do a backward jump (jump and push bacward same time), what you need to do is turn, then spin jump."

,Not Recommended,250660,21216018,"Posted: 14 February, 2016",all,Cyril,"This was kind of a ""so bad it's good"" game for a while, but then it got frustrating enough to wrap back around into ""so bad it's terrible"" territory.Like. The main problem comes down to the stiff, archaic controls. For one, stuff just flat out doesn't work sometimes, and random stuff just happens at other times. Double tapping to dash is always a bad mechanic, but here it doesn't even work half the time, and the other times you'll arbitrarily dash without meaning to. There's two different main jumps, a straight up jump that's taller and a lower spinning jump, and naturally the lower jump is useless in platforming and basically pointless to have at all. There's a dash kick you can use by attacking while dashing, which will sometimes arbitrarily stop for no reason and get you stuck not moving. TURNING AROUND in this game is a busted mechanic, even, you won't face the direction you're holding unless you perform the specific turning around animation first, and yes, this means you'll attack the wrong way quite often.  There's also three kinds of wall jump (though the game only tells you about one) which is great when wall jumping by itself is already super finnicky (seriously, worse than Super Metroid's wall jump... geez), and then sometimes a different wall jump than the one you want will activate (the low kicking jump is utterly useless and likes to trigger quite often). Basically, as you can see, nothing works. Outright. Nothing. It's basically one of the worst controlling games I've ever played; at least La-Mulana is consistent with its weird mechanics.So yeah, the controls alone make the game a failure, but then it's not like the rest of the game is great design-wise; it's generally pretty awful. Most of the boss designs are just spamfests; the first boss and the fourth boss are basically the only exceptions, the only bosses that feel actually skill-based instead of luck-based. The final boss especially is a seven phase monstrosity that boils down to just a battle of attrition more than anything else. And naturally the controls make the platforming pretty bad, though even then there's a lot of one-block jumps and weird wall jumps and with how arbitrary damage output of various things is it's just not fun. Spikes do a ton of damage and there are a few enemies who randomly do a ton of damage too, while everything else does relatively little in comparison. There's also a few attacks that stunlock you, even though other times you have decently long invincibility frames... who needs consistency? The puzzle designs are mixed, there's a few clever ones but a lot of them are just ""do section fast, if not, rewind time if you can"". And exploring in this game... is not fun at all, because of how awkward the game is to play. On top of that, secrets are hidden in pretty universally mean places, random blocks in the wall, fake walls guarded by breakable spikes (not all spikes are breakable, notably), switches hidden behind foreground objects, just, all sorts of stupid stuff, I didn't bother exploring without consulting a guide to make sure I wouldn't miss anything.So basically... the controls are garbage and the game design is garbage. It's... not a fun game in the slightest. It was a little fun in the earlier areas I guess, before all the game's problems really showed up in spades, but any part of the back half of the game was just filled with frustration and bitterness, it does not feel like this game likes players in the slightest.The graphics are okay though and the soundtrack is quite good, but that's not, like, going to save a fundamentally unfun game in the slightest :PUpdate regarding Chelsea mode:It's good, until the final boss, which is literally the worst part of the entire package. Instakills as late as the 8th phase and the 9th phase does half your maximum health with contact damage, disgusting."

The dashing relies on a double tap which works 50% of the time you NEED it to, and 50% when you need it to NOT dash.Jumping is also painful, as the game relies on several different jumps: jumping from a standstill, jumping while moving, jumping while dashing, and an attack kick which is an attack while dashing. Again, the dash jumps are painful because dashing barely works but jumping also sometimes doesn't react well when you need it. Also, jumping from a standstill has just a little more height than jumping while moving, and the game WILL require this. It makes trying to move through some parts really frustrating as you need to stop moving (and dodging!) to get a fraction more of an inch in your height to get to where you need to go.You'll stick to ledges of platforms your standing on, which works out okay when you want to stay on a platform, but it will magnetically pull you when you want to jump down past it, or throw you off small platforms when you attempt to land on them. Just.. infuriating when this part goes wrong.The fighting is fine, there are different weapons which feel great, the art is light-hearted and whimscle, and the game has clever time-manipulation puzzles, but I just can't recommend it due to the fact I want to break my controller in half when the game doesn't recognize my input to do a sequence of very precise moves, which is 90% of this game. 6/10"

This game is a really fun ""Metroidvania-style"" game. There are numerous upgrades to collect throughout the journey, but not all of them are necessary--Heck, you can even complete the game without the joke-upgrade that lets you turn around.The gameplay is very fast-paced and not too forgiving about mistakes. You later gain the ability to use your extra lives, but until that point you're pretty much on your own. That's not really a bad thing. The bosses are challenging enough that having something to lose REALLY makes it feel worth the time spent when you actually beat them.Another thing I love about this title is that it is so flexible about how you complete it. At least in Bunny's story, you can often do the bosses out of order, and they will change depending on what you do first. I actually managed to goof up a save-file doing this though. The first boss does NOT like to be defeated second. I couldn't beat her in pissy-mode.Anyway, my rambling aside, I love this game and I'm glad it's on Steam. If you like exploring a huge maze-like map while searching for upgrades, battling hilarious yet difficult bosses, and following a goofy storyline that somehow drags you in despite its lack of seriousness, then you'll love this game.Now if only I could figure out how I beat this thing in the first place.

However, it's absolutely no fun when you have to perform split second actions and deal with loads of things coming your way with stiff, unresponsive controls and character movement.  Especially when the only way to recover health is at a save point, and you usually wind up taking far too much damage than you should thanks to the aforementioned control problems.It's unfortunate that I have to give an otherwise creative and quirky Metroid-style game a snub.

Not nescissarily broken but just poorly executed. Unlike defining games of the genre, Super Metroid ans Super Castlevania 4, which ease you into the game and are more or less well scaled difficulty that challenges what you've learned in previous areas, this game gives you two or three screens to aquire the skills you need to face the first boss. After the aforementioned screens it basically turns into a Super Meat Boy/Touhou/Kaizo hybrid without any of the awesome game mechanics in any of the games mentioned.The shooting is cumbersome, at least on keyboard, And kinda hard to get used to in the SIX FIRGGIN SCREENS YOU HAVE TO DO SO!!! Super Metroid did have a similar 8 direction shooting mechanic, but at no point did you have to fight Flandre Scarlet with only one HP upgrade. This wouldn't be such a big deal if there was auto-fire like in, I don't know, most bullet hell shmups that let you fight back. To bring back metroid, the first major fight, Ridley, can be challenging but nothing you can't deal with because they hid the tutorial in the opening level and you are competent in basic combat  because of that.Keep in mind, I don't hate rediculously difficult games. In fact, Super Meat Boy is probably my favorite platformer. But what do all good insanely difficult games have in common? The answer, make death painless (Super Meat Boy), Funny (AVGN Adventures), or preface the game with the prospect of thousands of deaths (Dark Souls). Maybe it's because I grew up with games where death was an actual setback, but I kind of expect one of those three things in games where I can't expect not to die multiple times in the first 20 minutes of the game on a first playthrough. Deaths are supposed to tell you that you did something at least a little more stupid than not memorizing attacks, in this sense if you could take more than about 4 hits from the first boss, this might be more tolerable as you could get some bearing. Harking back to Super Meat Boy, technically, only the boss of chapter 4 is trial and error, everything else, with good reaction and recognising what does what, you could get through 99% of the levels in one life... if you're good enough.I also by no means hate anime esq art styles. what with skullgirls being my favorite head to head fighter. In fact in games that have them, they're often done remarkably well, including here. But the difference between SkullGirls and this atrocity  is that SkullGirls actually has good gameplay to back it upTwo last complaints: Soundtrack is lackluster and Chelsea is sounds about as grating as just about any character in any game I have played."

You still don't have to accept the fact you failed. You get full control, block everything, escape that from infinite single-wall jumps. Hardly ever will you have to think ''Oh, looks like that's gonna hit me.''  And it's absolutely amazing.The biggest downside is level design, which wouldn't be so bad if there was no difference in jumping while holding a direction, or jumping straight up and then pushing a direction. The latter gives you more height and you need to use it for some jumps. It feels a bit sloppy whenever you need to do that.A personal issue is unbalanced weapons? That might be just me though.  There is no reason to ever use anything other than the sword is how I see it. You don't have to turn around to effectively use the sword. To get the most of the other weapons, you do need to turn around. Turning takes half a second.Non-gameplay wise?I like the music but there are some pretty bad songs too.

Level design...As good as it is, there are parts where the designers are just exploiting the low accuracy of the controls to give the game difficulty, something I greatly disliked. The game makes broad use of geniously planned, challenging situations without having the need of pulling the ""Yeah good luck making this movement with the D-pad/Arrow Keys"", and sadly, it does, and it does it a lot.The aqua colored area is an example of this, while the Yellow Area with the purple bubbly floor is entertaining and challenging, the aqua area is just tedious.Then we have Chelsea...I'd have to make a separate entry to tell how badly written this character is; regardless of the ""unserious"" nature of this game, Chelsea just seems like something out of a DeviantArt webcomic, her personality, voice and powers are just plain stupid. While Bunny has a similar, bratty attitude, there is something in her that lets you enjoy the game... While Chelsea... She just makes everything SO boring and tedious, she is a totally flat character, and her ""Game"" feels just forced, as if the creator of the character had made a tantrum just to have their character in the game.Her gameplay is, while boring and unentertaining, marvelously achieved, Chelsea feels slow and clumsy, yes, but her skills do work and challenge you to find the correct use for them... Most of the time... And this is because the designers tried to play the ""Easy boss before, hard boss now"" card and they failed horribly. Some Lesser bosses are a big threat for Chelsea due to her rock slow combat and this just makes the fights long and boring, this feels extremely forced and unnecesary.Chelsea's final Bosses are cleverly designed, and whoever created those things has a reserved place in the Hall of A$$shole Designers (that is a compliment). This last part is the only thing I've enjoyed in Chelsea's Run... And that is dissapointing.Overall, Bunny Must Die is a pleasant experience for the most part, it is not for everyone and I believe that people that had problems with the 2D metroids and castlevanias will most likely dropping this game before long. Bunny's part is a solid 9/10. And that's what this game would've got if not for Chelsea... That part is boring, tedious and loaded with the ""This is so not worth it"" feel... And you're right, Chelsea is so not worth it; the only incentive I had to go with her was to save bunny.}On its own, Chelsea's part gets a 7/10, but let's say that the WHole ""Bunny Must Die!

The story isn't incredibly important, and the writing seems to be self-referential to the point were the game knows this too. It's funny, but ultimately you're there to murder everything you see.As for gameplay itself, it has the standard jumping, moving, attacking actions of any metroidvania, as well as some added techniques. In total, there are 6 weapons, each which different effects and powers that distinguish them from each other. No two weapons feel the same, which is good. The most interesting mechanicBMD!has is its time warping functionality : Bunny is capable of stopping time, allowing her to move past enemies, do specific platforming things, and as she collects more Yellow Powder, rewind time, heal herself, and more.True to any Metroidvania, Bunny encounters a variety of power-ups along her adveture, ranging from the ability to turn Right to wall-jumping, and even a suit that increases her bust size, giving her added offensive capabilities and slower movement. Not going to lie, it's pretty funny.As hinted at from above the line,BMD!is hard. Hellaciously hard, even. This is in part due to its steep difficult in platforming and overall difficult boss fights [which are equally as absurd as Bunny herself], but also to the game's most fatal flaw : the movement controls. Jumping is a feat in of itself. The entire system feels very clunky, and oftentimes, you might perform a somersault when you meant to do a straight jump, end up falling down a long tower shaft, and being forced to climb up again. Enemies also inflict a knockback when you're hurt, lending to frustrating moments [in particular, the Jade Tower comes to mind.] However, the controls aren't terrible, and can be surmounted with enough practice.The game's art and soundtrack are delightful. Environments and enemies look nice and distinct, and each musical score, while nothing particularly catchy or memorable, is nice to listen to. Bunny's voice acting is also pretty solid, but it should be noted that it is in Japanese. The game runs phenomenally well. In my experience, I encountered no graphical slow down, even with dozens of fireballs on the screen at once.A minor issue is that, should you play this game on Windows 10, you have to edit the game's configuration files to fix the window, otherwise it's just a black screen. It's annoying, but once it's fixed, it's gone.--------------------------------------------------------------Overall Rating7.3/10Bunny Must Die!is an overall enjoyable experience. Aside from its wonky controls, the gameplay is simple and fun, offering fast action and hair-trigger timing. The game is rather short, and can be beaten in as little as an hour [the game even has an achievement for doing so!], but that detail is offset by the fact it has an additional mode in which you play as a different character, who plays almost entirely differently. It is, at times, frustrating, but in the end,Bunny Must Die!is a game worth playing, and I feel as if it isn't talked about enough.PROS;+Excellent weapon variety and smooth combat.+Humorous story and characters+Wide variety of power-ups and gameplay options.+Second story mode adds replayability, in addition to speed-run possibilities.+Good art and music.+Excellent technical performance.+A worthy challenge.+You get to play as a Bunny Girl.

This are a few nice touches to sweeten the deal if you can survive the mechanics to experience them."

(i did the sequence break, making the boss way harder.) but seeing as one boss is a giant cat... lets say the devs have the best possible sense of humor, with giant cats, cat-bunny-something-or-other-girls, and germans shooting fire out of their below-the-belt. heavily reccomended. (WARNING: I HEAR PEOPLE SAY FULLSCREEN BREAKS IT BY MAKING THE SCREEN BLACK, BUT THE AUDIO PLAYS. BE CAUTIOUS.)"
