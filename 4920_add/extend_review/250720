I bought this game based on some of the positive reviews posted here, and I had seen that this was a Kickstarter baby.  That gave my high hopes for either something innovative or a true throw-back to Wing Commander.  In truth, this is less WC or X-Wing and more a knock-off of Strike Suit Zero...which SSZ reminded me more of those lousy Wing Commander clones you used to be able to get for the PS1.  I played the game through a Patrol mission and the first Campaign mission.  All i can say is that I really want my $20 back.  For being a game no longer in Early Access and the ""Final"" version, I encountered my first bug a few minutes in when the targeting reticle in cockpit-view mode disappears after firing the gun for a few minutes.  Also, the cockpit graphics themselves are awful, ugly and appear (IMO) to be slapped on as an afterthought.  Reinforcing this opinion is that the starfighter handles better in 3rd person mode than cockpit mode.  The VO sync with the Ready Room animation is like watching bad muppets.  I was so disgusted that by the end of the 1st campaign mission i uninstalled and was compelled to write a review.  Bottomline: lousy graphics, poor space mechanics, derivitative gameplay of shiity knock-offs of a much better game = AVOID, it's not what it claims on the tin."

First time i tried to play it i couldn't because of a movie loading glitch. As soon as it loaded and you came to the splash screen it crashed. First i asked the devs to take a look into this matter, and they say they had it fixed. Four months later i reinstalled the game and the same thing happened. So i took it upon myself to try to fix the game and found out if you delete all the movies  you can get to the menue and play the game.  The controls are not smooth and if you don't play with an xbox controller, you have no hope in completing the game. Even the contols for the xbox are not smooth and jerky. Trying to aim at a moving target is hopeless if you want to use your guns and you only have limited amount of missles that you have to buy after each mission.The lighting is so dark on everything. You cant see the ships you are shooting at just the aiming reticles in front of them. Walking around on the ship is like you are in a cave and everybody has a tan. The frame rate jumps up and down like a jack rabbit on crack. The second mission you have to turn the dynamic lighting off to even get a frame rate you can play it at. And then you cant see anything until you are right up on top of it.  The developers say this game is ready for final release. If you buy this game you are in for a big surprise.  If this game was freeware i wouldn't even bother downloading it. There isn't one good thing i can say about the game except the demo movie looked good. The people are talking statues and not very realistic. They talk and you cant listen to them for more than a few seconds before you jump to the mission so you dont have to hear them anymore. The narration is like, give me a break. Hope they didnt pay anybody for the voices. Game is just crap is the final word to describe it."

It is now not in early Access anymore.Few things:No options menu. Keys are not rebindable. Graphic options are What kind of window you use and dynamic lightning on or off. 1/10Trainings Mission. I didn't get past it. Not because it's hard or anything the like. It's just horrible. First of all, handling, graphics and sounds are as generic as possible. I could get over this. The targets you are supposed to destroy don't show anywhere. They, if you are lucky, pop out right in front of you. 0/10Voice acting is terribad. Nothing else to add. Not that important but i thought i should mention it.There seems to be some kind of mouse acceleration ingame. It's very clunky.Bugs. Bugs bugs bugs. Full release. -5/10Last but not least: The performance is not acceptable. A game that looks like this should never drop below 200 fps on anything. Sadly it does. It flickers, it has horrible draw distance and the graphical fidelity is.. indie. Maybe the only thing to say about it.TL;DR: Don't buy it. Unless it's on sale. Not for full prize. Never."

76561197970546102,Not Recommended,250720,18975375,"Posted: 9 November, 2015",all,/MB\,"This was a nice attempt and far better than I could have done.  With so many space combat sim options now there is no reason to buy this.Pros:  Tries fairly hard to be a good Wing Commander / Freespace 2 clone and briefly captures the nostalgia.Cons:- Very outdated graphics.- First person out of cockpit experience poorly implemented.  The actual movement lags behind a reticule causing motion sickness and an overall bad experience.- Shield / Stealth Module / Missiles / Mission contextual special device all tied to the same secondary weapon cycle.- The large amount of ships have been copied and pasted from an online description somewhere without even bothering to change minor things to make it ""spacey"".-  There is no incentive in the campaign to use more than 1 top notch fighter with a single configuration after the training mission despite the impressive number of ships.- Missiles have a description of Air-to-Air and appear to be copied from the same source as the ships.  They should be described as Ship to Ship or Ship-to-Surface.- Taking out satellites is a very boring extra bonus objective that really doesn't seem to affect the overall outcome of the mission or campaign.  The point of secondary & tertiary objectives are to enhance the overall campaign or to be of good effect in case the primary objectives can't be reached or if there were extra ordinance & time/fuel.-  Some ground targets sink below the surface of planets/asteroids making them unreachable by weapons and blocking mission completion at 100%.In summary I love the spirit of the game, and the desire to make a space combat sim again.  When this was greenlit, there was almost nothing new out at the time and it was a gap waiting to be filled.  Now that Elite Dangerous is ""out"" and Star Citizen is maybe about to release something more fun to do than run people over with golf carts this game is relegated to the never to be installed or played again pile with about 100 other games in my library unless it receives some serious changes."

I will recommend this game but there are caveats to this. 1) This game is awkward in play. The eating dinner over your best friend's house, after you have just been caught making out with his sister awkward. I absolutely hate the FPS movement through the ships. It's slow and when your alerted to report to the ready room you just mosey along to get there. The tutorial flight needs to more indepth. I ""accidently"" found out how to allocate power and command wingmen 3 missions in. 2) The flight mechanics are disturbing at times as you find yourself struggling to get the ship to right itself on a trajectory. I like being able to fly near the surface of a planet just not in one. One mission requires you to go underground killing bad guys and finding a scientist. You take damage hitting walls but the enemy ships ping pong ball of the sides making it impossible to hit them and they take NO damage. Loose this mission or change the scientist to a surface station.  3) Voice acting poor. The briefer for the first few missions looks like his is in his fifties but the voice is of a later teens to early twenties young man. Same akwardness with the stories one pilot who liked he was straight out of high school had 10yrs of experience. 4) The credit system isn't consistent. I completed a round and saw all sorts of bonuses flash up and completed bonus missions and recived nothing after the brief. All the work for nothing. Prestige points? Really? I have to earn a certain amount of points to get descent equipment? I would understand completeing some missions and getting extra stuff in mission to have new equipment to be researched then availible after a period of time.Now after all this I really do like the game, I hate the fact it's VERY Crossfire unfriendly. I had to disable it all together. The game has promise but it needs alot of work. I do recommend this, just be prepared to be annoyed a little bit."

Re-mapping keyboard controls doesn't work -- unable to change controls. Difficult to find objectives after last waypoint. No way to review previous communcations. 1st person controls slow.

The controls were sluggish, the characters were hideous by modern standards and the cockpit was worse than in X-Wing Alliance.But that was then.Unfortunately now most of those issues still remain. The controls have been semi improved as have the characters but the cockpits are still lackluster. Adding insult to injury is the fact that the development team has been absent for an unsettling amount of time. There have been only a few patches since transitioning from Early Access to Full Product. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of professionalism and quality shown by the folks at Escape Hatch Entertainment."

If you could jump into the starfighter and launch/land from the flight deck, it would heighten immersion and cool factor. Mouse feels laggy and optimization is poor at this stage. Despite the poor performance, the graphics are not stellar. Feels like a slightly updated wing commander game. Again, this could be awesome by release, but only slightly enjoyable currently. Multiplayer was just added today, but I missed where the steam advertised ""coop"" features were, as I only saw deathmatch/capture the flag type multiplayer modes.I look forward to seeing improvements from future updates."

(You can't shut down the game or return to menu after starting a mission.)I honestly believe that the devs should take their thumbs out of their arses and try to salvage this game, jesus christ just do it it has potential."

This game reminds me of all the Wing Commander games from the days of old. When I first heard about this game, they wanted to bring back the dog fighting space days of the past. They succeeded. Hands down, succeeded. The love that went into this game is so visable. Now, ofcourse being an early access game, there are quite a few bugs. Good news, the developers are well aware of the problems and are constantly working to improve and fix gameplay issues. The controls of flight can sometimes be a bit twitchy, but spend a little time with it and they become as familiar as Xwing VS Tie Fighter. Pick up this game, support these guys. This game will definetely keep you busy until Star Citizen is released.....in 2024. lol"

It has a somewhat primitive but to me good enough cockpit view. They actually did a lot of effort in the capital space ships models and you can look around in one of the space carrier ships. Pretty awesome. The music and sound effects are good.What the game lacks is a smooth joystick control. I tested this with my Logitech Extreme 3D pro that I usually use for the fast pace arcade style (space) simulator games. If you use the keyboard then the joystick stops working, but after you shoot it will work again. Also rolling the spacecraft to level you with the spacecraft is difficult with a joustick. A minor few nuisances.So it is a promising game but not finished yet with those bugs mentioned above. Would I recommend it? Yeah if they iron out the bugs go for it. If not just wait a little."

I mean, yes, walking around the ship so slow (and pointless, really) that it's more of a chore than a perk, and the voice acting is distractingly bad, but I could look past such things.What really grinds my gears is what happens when you try to fly the ship. Just getting the thing pointed in the direction you want it to go is more of a battle than the actual fighting. Not only is the steering about as smooth as Paul Bunyan's beard, it's totally unpredictable. It's like your ship is saying, ""Now, I know you SAID you wanted to pull straight up to put your target right in your crosshairs, buuuuut I think what you really want is for me to pull up, go slightly to the right, then instead of stopping on the target I'll jerk hard left. And up a little. And then left a little more. Soooo, I'm gonna do that instead. Myea.""Even if your ship didn't follow directions with the obedience of a 2 year old or a cat, the ships turn so slow to begin with that even what should be the most maneuverable ones just feel dull and lifeless.I hope they patch some of this stuff up, because if the flight controls felt more like they do in the games SI is trying to emulate (Freespace, X-Wing, Wing Commender, Tachyon) it would be fantastic. Till then, it's no more than a bunch of pretty lights and cool ideas that just aren't any fun."

Not becouse of its average graphics, or its respect for physics in space(maybe in the future they have pumped gass into space that allows for space craft to act like like air craft flying in an atmosphere and SOUND IN SPACE XD), I came every where becouse of the premise of the game and the game play.  This game causes spontanious orgys in the pleasure centers of my brain becouse it is a game like wing commander.  Starlight inception is part of human centipede of games that are the grand children of wing commander,  And this is a good thing.  I like the space sim human centipede.  However one of the ways that this game could be possibly at the front of the space sim human centipede,where it would not have to eat the♥♥♥♥♥♥of outher games, would be to incorporate realistic space physics into space combat.  An exsample of this is Kerbal Space Program.  While ksp is not a combat game it does have realitic space physics when flying space craft..in space.  Although this might make the learning curve a little steap for some people,  It will make the game that much more rewarding, and it will help the game stand out.
