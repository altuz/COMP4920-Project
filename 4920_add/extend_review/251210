It is a game that MENSA backed and I can see why. It has the mechanics to make each game a quick strategic test, the more moves you think ahead the more chance you have to win. Each bug moves differently (like chess) and the aim is to suround the enemy queen. They have included many achievements for those who are interested and different bugs have been added to allow customised games and re-playability."

However, there is some minor wonkiness with the interface:1. You can't pan around because it really isn't necessary, but this causes an effect with some tile placements where you have to find the portion of the tile at the top which isnn't being obscured by other text.2. There are announcements that are displayed when a move repeats a previous hive configuration that are very distracting and practically useless because they obscure the playfield.3. The developers used this 3D zoom-out display mechanic that automatically scales the playfield to hold the tile configuration, even when there is only one huge tile on the playfield at the very beginning of the game.Despite these minor problems, the game is very enjoyable and is the perfect distraction for ten minutes between other activities."

Is this game fun to play?Answer: Kind of, but it's a pretty basic implementation. It's a digital version of the game with a basic UI... that's it.The game board itself cleanly presented with an elegant, yet striking, design. Animations are clean and the possible moves being highlighted is an excellent touch (especially for spiders). Any illegal move is also explained to the player, so it's nicely intuitive. However, the menu and UI is poor, there's little music / atmosphere and, unlike the likes of Chessmaster, there's nothing else in-game to teach tactics, suggest moves or the equivalent of ""2 moves to checkmate"" style puzzles... So it really depends what you expect from it. If you literally just want a means to play the game against the AI or another player (local or otherwise), this should suffice. Anything else, and it might feel a little bare.As for Hive itself, the game plugs the ""more complex than Chess"" spiel as it mathematically has more possible moves... But if I was to rearrange my eyebrow hairs, that would mathematically haveeven morepossible combinations ... so buy my eyebrows*. Mathematical complexity doesn't necessarily make it more fun or strategic. What itis, however, is a clever little tactical duel that can generally last about 5-10 mins (if that). Whilst it doesn't have the same drawn out development or range that chess does; it's punchy, the bug types are interesting and the fact that the game board is dynamically built by the pieces themselves is a nice twist. But where many pieces quickly get pinned, it can equally make the game a bit frustratingly fiddly (and limited) at times.What you ultimately get is a quick filler with tactical depth... but that's about it. If you're not looking for anything fancy though (i.e. are guilty of clicking many hours away on Solitaire) and want something with a lot more bite, this could well be worth a shot. Just note though that the game is missing 3 pieces, which are sold individually as DLC.*Please don't. I like them"

Just answer these questions:-Do you like Chess?-Do you want to play Chess with different rules?-Do you want to play Chess on an open board?If you answered ""Yes"" to all then this game is for you.Basically, Hive is an open minded Chess game. The strategy feels simular, yet different, and possibly more challenging. You get to choose what pieces you want to play and how to play them. You can play agressive or defencive, based on your set up. This being said, I think most people who like Chess will like Hive.The one drawback I have so far is that to play online you have to sign up with an account not connected to steam. So I've only played against the AI. They have been challenging enough for me and enjoyable. However, I've only put 2.5 hours into the game and have beaten the hardest level AI.

Fun game.As a program it works well.  The controls are easy.  Not clunky at all.  I love that you can take days between turns.  Not that we have had to do that, but our job is such that we can't just sit and look at the game board.  Being able to walk away for 30 minutes or an hour...etc., and not miss your turn is a great option.

I definitely should've paid more attention to what each piece can do and not tried right off the bat to beat the hardest difficulty. When I lowered the difficulty back to normal, I was able to win several games and explore several different strategies. I bought the DLCs with it because I got the game on sale and wanted to see how the ladybug, mosquito, and pillbug added to the gameplay and strategical depth. On the surface, it looked relatively simple, but once I got about an hour into it, I saw just how much there is to this game.The object of the game is just to surround your opponent's queen bee piece on all it's sides. To do that, you and your opponent take turns moving or placing different bugs to create the game board (called the hive). There's the army ant, which can move any number of spaces along a straight line. It can't go over any pieces, however. There's also the grasshopper that has to move in a straight line hopping over pieces as it goes. There's a beetle that can climb on top and over any piece. Any piece that it's resting on top of can't move as long as the beetle is on top of it. All the beetles can be stacked on top of each other, too, but I'm not sure that there's any reason to do that. MY favorite is the spider which always moves 3 spaces. It can't go up and over pieces and always has to move 3 spaces. It's one of the trickiest pieces to work with, but extremely satisfying when used successfully. The queen bee always has to be placed by your 4th turn and can only move 1 space at a time-kind of like the king in chess. That's it for the main game's bugs. Together they provide a decent amount a variety to the strategies that can be used, but like I said, I got the DLCs for it, so I also get to use the ladybug, mosquito, and pillbug. Each of them has a special ability that makes them uniquely powerful for certain situations. The mosquito can be the most powerful piece in the game and the weakest. Alone, it has no ability to move, but it's special ability is that it can copy the movement abilities of any piece that it is touching. And yes, that means, the more pieces, the more abilities. The ladybug is a little strange. It can move on top of the hive (other pieces on the game board) for 2 spaces, but then it has to come back down. It's extremely useful in certain situations. And lastly is the pillbug. It's the piece I've used the least in the game so far, but it can be a real life saver. It moves like the queen (only 1 space at a time) but it has the unique ability to be able to move any piece that touches it-regardless of whether it's yours or the enemy's. It can only move one piece a turn, but still, if used correctly, like I said, it can be a live saver."

Well-designed in terms of how the various pieces interact, and their distributions.  Personally, I think the game isn't fully realized without the DLC, and those pieces should have been included with the basic game, otherwise your limited options will often leave you playing to a draw.

I am not to whine about the multiplayeror something - developers have no way of changing this self-perpetuatinglack of online games.The game graphics is pretty nice, it is visible that it was not createdby a profesional, but it is nice nevertheless. The UI is comfortable,love the idea of long term games.But there is a lot of bitterness also, the game is buggy, freezes at randomtimes, I even encountered some Null Pointer Exception with a Queenapart from the hive. Come on, this game have 4 years, the developershad lots of time to fix the bugs, not that it is extremely cheaps also.The above mentioned are the main reason why I can not recommendthe game, what is a pitty because it had huge potential.As a last small complaint - the sound track is not that bad, but playingthe same 30 or so seconds of music in a loop sounds rather like a proofof concept, a sample of a full soundtrack you want to give to the producerduring the artist selection, and not a fully fledged soundtrack,that's marginal taking gameplay bugs though.(perhaps it is a problem with Windows 10? how could it havesuch high reviews otherwise)"

I own it and take every opportunity that I have to share it with others.The digital version falls short in every way. I really can't even beleive they are charging money for this. The AI is shockingly horrible. There is literally no difference between the top three difficulty levels. None. The computer makes numerous mistakes and obvious misplays.Don't worry, at least there's multiplayer right? No. There isn't. It looks like there is, but nobody plays. Most likely because the matchmaking system looks awful and most likely doesn't work. There is no way to chat in the lobby. There are literally no games...ever. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME HOPING TO PLAY ONLINE WITH RANDOMS, IT WON'T HAPPEN.I feel cheated. I can't believe I paid money for this.

My only con for the developers are that the harder the AI becomes the slower (dog slow on highest level) the game becomes.   I suspect this because the AI difficulty is looping through every possible move to determine how to beat the user versus a more advance AI algorithm.   Great game though, fun and original!"

Wait time for an online game is usually upwards of 20 minutes. It's best to get this game if you already kind of have someone you're going to play it with.]The boardgame version is an instant classic, and so I got really excited once I saw it on Steam. My brother and I love the game, so I picked up a 2-pack and sent him a copy. Thanks, steam sale!For those of you who haven't played it before, think of this as a fast-paced version of Chess based on insects. Instead of your pieces arrayed on the board, you actually create the board as you lay pieces down one by one and move them around. Very fluid. A typical game will only take you around 5 minutes, though, not 5 hours. The base game is fun, though the expansion DLC is a must-buy to enjoy the game's full potential.My main concern was with how the game would look and play, especially since it's a port. The trailer left a bit to be desired.First impressions after a half hour of play:- Visuals are crisp and fluid, much better than you'd think from viewing the trailer.- Music gets old, fast.- AI is good enough to give you a challenge, especially if you're new to the game or just kind of rusty. I've busted through the first 3 tiers of AI in about 30 minutes.- Love having the ability to change the visual style of the pieces. Charcoal (the grayscale) is my favorite. Wasn't too keen on the '3D' style. A little disappointed that there isn't any way to visually customize the, er, 'table' that you're playing on, but this is a tiny gripe at best.- Multiplayer seems ... functional? I guess? There were only 3 people on when I tried, all of whom I guess were AFK, so couldn't test it. There is an online mode though so that makes me happy. There's also hotseat for those who want that.- Multiplayer lobby lacks a chat function. That sucks. I've had to deal with the same problem in other games, though, especially with XBox ports. Form a steam group, I guess -_-All and all it's a faithful representation of the game with only very minor drawbacks, and well worth the money. A 2-pack with all DLC is going for 11 bucks right now for the summer sale."
,Not Recommended,251210,34941851,Posted: 13 September,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Boards & CardsAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Insect themed tabletop strategy. Interesting and different. I have to re-learn the game everytime I play it, and every time it leaves me a bit unimpressed and vaguely bothered.Complex brainy freeform chess. Solid mechanically but lazy effort on the engine, audiovisuals, game modes, input support. Having to relearn this kind of tabletop chess game to be stuck playing the computer is probably not engaging. Better suited as an actual board game where you can play with a person face to face. I think this was officially backed by the mensa association at some point. To be honest I dont see the relevance. Computers will always beat humans at these kind of games anyways so why bother being competitive about it between us.The game does have pass and play as well as online features and I did see some games in progress in the servers...As for the strategy itself. It is turn based, with one person moving first but with a handicap to make up for it. You basically construct a snake-like group formation that you can then reshape based on the movement rules of each individual pieces you placed down. e.g. grasshoppers can move over other pieces like knights while spiders can float anywhere on the outer rim of the snake but cannot be caught between two other pieces (im making those rules up). Goal is for snake to coil back on itself, trapping the other person's queen while yours is still free.The thing is there is no tutorial and there is just a miniature wiki website inside the help button. I have read that indepth the first time I tried the game when it came off bundles. Got me good enough to get a match going but nowhere near a point where the game got engaging and I could feel myself thinking tactically. It was just clunky to figure out what goes where and the interactivity felt off for a computer game.As a result I find myself never really wanting to play and removing it for declutter."
