,Recommended,251230,25268620,"Posted: 31 August, 2016",all,Notebook,"I'm torn on this game.It frustrates me because the game itself is really fun!The whole running through a post-apocaltypic wasteland full of robots that you can mow down with an arsenal of weapons and 'functions' is hugely enjoyable.The story is predictable as all hell but I can forgive a super cliche storyline that sits somewhere betweenSOMA and A Space Odyssey.Where my frustrations lie is in how little of the game there actually is.You have a campaign that you can run on Easy, Normal and Hard, though you may as well rename those ♥♥♥♥♥♥Easy' 'Very Easy' and 'Easy' because the game itself isn't hard and as mentioned in other reviews you have unlimited continues, the only consequence to dying is having your score multiplier reset.The only other play mode is Survival Mode, which is exactly what you expect, though the area you use in Survival Mode is pitifully small, though thankfully it does actually get pretty damn hard around the 20 minute mark.And... that's it.A campaign and a survival mode.GAAAH!!!I'm just not satisfied! This is a good game, truly it is!To the Devs of this game I have this to say:1. Bring up the difficulty because this is way too easy and/or give us something like a Hardcore Mode where you don't get continues and the robots are genuinely hard opponents!2. You've got a real gem here, but there's so little to do! More modes, more Chassis' just... give us more! I feel you released this just a bit too early, or perhaps figured 'Ah that'll do' and held back.------------------------------------------------------------------For now, I'm tentatively recommending the game.It is fun and if you do buy it, you'll enjoy what it does currently offer.But if you're expecting to spend days playing this, you're going to be disappointed."

I must admit upon my first couple of hours i enjoyed it to some degree - i was playing solo offline to get used to the game, then however i entered a few online matches. Online Gameplay is very different, slowing down and some hideous sound clicking issues when the voice audio kicks in over the background fire etc. The part of this game i was most looking forward to is the most dissapointing of all - Survival mode, i  expected some streets/arena  to run around  with team mates blasting and running for your life.What you actually get in survival is the tiniest survival area i have ever seen in a game , its basically a small square of land always the same. One of the greatest problems is the game is just too easy, even on hard with unlimited continues you can just keep running through levels and eventually complete them . Gameplay is also extremely linear with a few walls you can break to reveal ""secrets"" these are basically score multiplyers.I couldnt recommend this game as i really dont feel there is enough content for £15 . Others may really be enjoying it but for me it was a waste of hard earned cash. As a result of the problems with the game i  requested a refund from steam however as i have played 5 hours ( virtually all offline ) i cant get one. So if you decide to purchase this game play it online immediately to see if the online / survival suits you . Not happy with the game , not particularly happy with steam refund policy on this one."

The graphics are incredible, the gameplay feels smooth, and there is a good bit of versatility in which character you use and which weapons you equip with them.  The only downside is it is pretty short.  There is replayability in going through the campaign with three different characters, all feel different than each other, also three levels of difficulty.Overall, at full price its a good game and will provide a lot of fun for fans of the genre, if you get it on sale it is a great deal."

,Recommended,251230,28985326,Posted: 3 January,all,Miphnificent!,"Do not listen to all the people whining about no local co-op. The Steam page for this game has never claimed to have local co-op (unless that tag was added by a community member), and a cursory glance at Google would allow for anyone to find out instead of buying the game and then complaining.Livelock is an incredibly fun Twin-Stick Shooter, with likable characters and some humor. Even with only having played the game a few hours (Waiting on friends) I've had tons of fun playing the game with them, as the co-op is done absurdly well. Livelock follows the tales of three humans who have been inducted into a project to transfer their mental state into artificial bodies, thus earning them the name of ""Intellect"". Tasked with ridding the scourge on the planet, the intellects set out with their semi-anonymous AI guiding them as they go. Explore through massive cities and wasteland as you small massive robots and quell bosses.Pros:- Well done Co-op, with each character within the game having a specified role, and none seeming underpowered.- Customizable skins for each character, allowing for you to customize your character with specific head slots, capes, and colors.- VERY WELL DONE HARD DIFFICULTY. Tuque has done an extremely sensible thing with their difficulties. Enemies don't become bullet sponges with each difficulty increase, but instead they do higher amounts of damage, so the game still seems extremely fair. If you die, it's your own fault.- Extensive controller support for Xbox 360 (unsure about PS3) with remappable buttons for controllers.- Drop in/drop out Co-op play.- Extremely satisfying weapons arsenal, and extremely satisfying skills for each character.- Massive Robots to smash.- Well done (however limited) weapon arsenal which has downsides and upsides for each weapon. All weapons seem very well thought out and balanced.Cons:- Storyline is nothing amazing. Whilst there are Codex's and whatnot for world building, the setting is rather generic, even though it seems the developer put a lot of time and effort into it, as well as much love.- Limited Upgrade system which allows you to only increase weapon powers/abilities with bonus effects as you level and unlock their upgrades.- Limited weapon arsenal. Whilst the weapons are extremely interesting, there just sadly aren't enough of them.What improvements could be made?:- Access to Steam Workshop for mods such as new characters, levels, storylines and so on.- Better upgrade system.Overall: 7/10. The game is nothing amazing or innovative, however it is incredibly fun, and has left me clamoring for more after each session with my friends. Don't listen to all the whiny people downvoting the game due to no local co-op, which the Steam page does not claim that the game has. If you're looking for a game which is several hours of fun, wait for the game to go on sale once more and pick it up.Worth $20? No. Whilst the game is fun, I'd suggest waiting for a sale."
,Recommended,251230,31490639,Posted: 1 May,all,TEKnowledgy,Taking my time I beat the game in around 10 hrs that is just with one char maybe 30hr game to beat with all chars to master all chars maybe 35 hrs by master i mean max level and all unlocks maybe 40hrs to fully master the game including weapon upgrades.It's a good game not as good as i hoped it to be  meta score probably pretty accurate helldivers might would be a better choice for the $20 price tag.I never played the co-op side though I'm sure it would be fun but the game is so short lived it would probably get pretty repetitive even in co-op. Try helldivers if you are into games like this you'll probably be happier with it. I have played both and I own both.
,Recommended,251230,32105899,Posted: 1 June,all,KAHUNA,"TL:DR - This is a fun little twin-stick, ability-shooter game with some nice variety and customization, but left me wishing there was more of it. I enjoyed the game's bullet-hell brawler feel as a change of pace from more technical games like Helldivers or longer-term time sinks like Diablo 3. Worth playing.Pros:+Decent class variety. Offers 3 classes which each have a primary focus, but have several ways you can play them and different twists you can put on their abilities.+Growth feels rewarding in the way it enhances power and increases playstyle options.+Decent enemy variety; playing a given character or loadout has quite different strengths or weaknesses depending on the enemy type.+Fully voiced storyline and characters.+Challenge and Endless modes, for when you're done with the campaign.+Co-op, so you can play with friends!Neutral points:=Max level can be achieved on any class with 1 playthrough of the campaign, vs games like Diablo 3 which require endless grinding for smaller and smaller improvements. I found it nice to hit max, then focus on the build options rather than constantly feel there was more to be done. The resulting lack of longevity may be a con for some however.=No loot - power and abilities are only improved through class level.=No RNG, either in abilities, attacks or drops. Some players may find this less exciting, since there is never that ""ultra-rare drop"" but there is also no disappointment in getting ""screwed by RNGesus"". Up to you if you like it this way or not.Cons:-Fairly short campaign, leaving you wanting more when its done.-Challenge and Endless modes are both set on a single, small map which isn't especially interesting, making these modes feel repetitious after a few hours. Honestly playing the campaign on high difficulty in co-op is more fun, since it seems to be where the devs concentrated most of their attention.-A few ability upgrades appear to be bugged, making certain options seem non-functional.-Mechanics for depth and variety are present, but lack content. For example, each ability can be customized with bonus special effects, much like the ability rune system in Diablo 3, but there are only 4-5 abilities per class and only 2 upgrades per ability, so build tinkering is fun while it lasts, but has a fairly short life-span.Overall, I would recommend this game as a fun change of pace, even at full price. You will get your money's worth, just don't expect this to be your next 300 hour game. At 50% off, I would say go for it if you enjoy twin stick, or ability shooter games, it's good at what it does, I just wish there was more of it."

It's a shooter where you choose one of three types of robots that each have their own specialization; the usual tank/DPS/support.From there you unlock new changes to your abilities and appearance which is really when I started to get into the game a bit more. I found myself thinking that the ""chassis"" (robot)- Which was catalyst(support)- I started out with so good that I wasn't too tempted to try the other types. However, my friends said the same about the robot types they were playing.Which drives home the real value of this game, in that it lends itself to a fun co-op experience and an absolute blast to play with buddies."
,Not Recommended,251230,32669148,Posted: 23 June,all,Carnivore Angel,"There's nothing functionally /wrong/ with Livelock - it's a top-down shooter with pretty graphics where you blow away lots of robots as a different robot, and gain xp to level up and get more weapons and abilities.  It's a servicable game.  But it has enough problems that I'm going to seek a refund.  Some problems are mechanical, but there's a bigger issue that I'll get to later.Livelock looks great, that's for damn sure, but while playing, I encountered a number of technical issues, including seemingly random hitching and momentary framerate drops, as well as a bizarre problem where the audio would cut out for an instant every few seconds.  These issues compounded the game's clunky, laggy-feeling controls, and generally made it feel really awkward to play.These are issues I would have eagerly looked past if the game had stuck with its original vision - something I was eagerly anticipating, only to have it replaced with something that was merely acceptable.  Back when the game was announced as 'World War Machine', it looked like everything I wanted - a fun action game with progression, a kickass aesthetic, and a healthy dose of transhuman philosophy; fragments of the original vision are still here, in the setting's premise, but they're lost behind snarky quips, dumbed-down story and dialogue, and Catalyst's giant metal rear.  I don't know what happened, or why the developers abandoned their more mature premise in favour of something much simpler, but Livelock resembles World War Machine just enough to force me to think about all the ways it could have been so much more interesting.(seriously though, this is a post-human apocalypse, and the last humans are desperately clawing away from the abyss using mechanical chassis - what kind of person goes 'oh, hold up, we can't save our trapped brethren yet, I need to wait for my chassis' butt to finish printing so the players will have something to stare at'?  I miss the haunting, barely-humanoid figures in the concept art.  I miss the game this could have been.)"

Dev said they are an indy company and have no intention of adding to the game and they feel the cost/content is justified and that it has a lot of reply value (which I disagree with. To me its a one and done game. Survival mode is a bit of a joke.. It's on a little tiny island*, and you don't get anything out of it other than bragging rights.). Content is about 8 hours long.  I returned the game but if they ever announce that they are going to work on editions, expansions, DLC, Content, etc then I will pick it up again because it is actually a good game.Very shiney and polished. Plays very well. Skills and upgrades were cool (though I wished there were more than 3 classes/characters).  I had no probs** with it at all other than it was short and the survial mode is kind of pointless and lackluster.Someone recommended Helldivers since I complained about content.

If that is ever made I will probably get fired from my job.*When I said tiny I meant TINY.

,Recommended,251230,29264068,Posted: 14 January,all,ElusiveOne,"Livelockis a very decent top-down shooter that generally performs well as a whole but doesn't present anything spectacular enough to seriously distinguish itself.It offers well-executed classic core gameplay supported by generally decent production values. Looks good and feels good, except it never gets really exciting, save perhaps for its satisfyingly colourful visual effects.It's post-apocalyptic future is explained through a standard and predictable story line, where mankind has more or less been replaced by autonomous machines waging an endless war over conflicting evolutionary ideologies. So, time to shoot anything that moves.Partially destructible environments laid out across linear levels provide a minimum amount of exploration and a surprising diversity of enemies. Your arsenal likewise features interesting but basic upgrades and configuration options. The game's smooth progression is nicely set up to essentially give you one new upgrade per completed level up until the end of the campaign.Relentless action in some areas sometimes cause too many robot parts exploding all over the place that make it hard to distinguish the action. However, these segments are perhaps the most empowering portions of the game and the accompanying fireworks and light show are quite entertaining.Technically competent, except for the occasional sound cuts and overlapping dialogues. Unpolished camera work in some sections feel abrupt. Some collectibles for those interested.Character body parts very often intersect during their animations, and while this is not completely uncommon on biological character models it certainly clashes on futuristic war machines made of solid armored metal.Some missions may be too challenging to play alone but unlimited respawns at normal difficulty nullifies the problem. Playing with the rare occasional online player makes the game a lot more enjoyable but unfortunately the community is more than slim.Play this game if you like to blow stuff up and ask questions later (or not at all) but don't expect to get that ""just one more"" craving. Provides approximately 5 reasonably enjoyable hours for one playthrough with a single mechanical chassis, presumably three times that if you intend to play and fully upgrade all classes."

Things you might wish to know:Pros:-The visuals and art design of this game is fantastic and way beyond levels of other similar 3rd person shootings-The game's mechanism is fairly easy. You barely need to learn and adaptCons:-Too few choices of weapons. This game only has 3 classes (that is fine), and each class has 3 type of weapons. The problem is each type of weapon only has 2 alternatives, which is way too few. And sadly, the two choices aren't hugely different in practice...-Too few choices of support powers. Each class only has 4 powers to select, among which you can choose 3, barely even a choice to make-Enemy design isn't cool. The main characters look really awesome, but the design of enemies are raw. You are putting a high-end post apocalyptic fight against some robots that are literally picked up from scrapyards-Campaign length is too short, and too easy to fnish. Unless doing highest difficulty, which gives 1 life per mission only, a starter can beat it through in a night without many difficulties-Leveling up and gaining upgrades is too easy. I leveled to 30 in a night, with all weapons and their alternatives fully upgraded.↑ which makes this game an awesome one-time try, but no replayability.The game's market performance also seem not very successful, potentially because of those ""too few elements"" problems listed above and failures on advertising"

As a longtime Dliablo player, and  Hell Divers player as well, I was hoping soemthing fresh and new with Livelock. I've played it for a couple of hours so far.When I initially got into the game world, I was really impressed by the quality of the graphics and the destructable environment. However, once I saw past that, the game began to seem relatively thin. The game now appears to be a grind of the same mobs in similar cirdcumstances - battlign in war-torn city scapes.Although there is some plot: a goal to find the encryption keys that would let us unlock eden, it feels more like an excuse for the action than a true motivation for the character. The characters and combat are pretty, but something about the controls feel sluggish. I can't manage to precisely maneuver, beyond combat roles. It seems nearly impossible to avoid taking damage with the melee character, and the long delay between his keypresses and actions makes him feel bumbling. If you're looking for a limber coop shootemup, turn to Assault Android Cacus instead.Your characters get stronger as you level up, which automatically gives you new weapons and abilities, but I'm already most of the way through upgrading one of them. I was disappointed - it doesn't offer a shadow of the customization of any other RPG.I haven't met any other NPCs, and the only players I see are in multiplayer. The apocalyptic world manages to feel especially devoid of intelligent life in Livelock, and I struggle to maintain the interest level to carry on."

I enjoyed the game play, artwork, soundtrack and voice work, however, finishing the co-op game in 5 hours was just so disappointing, especially since we didn't rush through it. My personal rule for gaming is you should at least get 1 hour per dollar spent (unless its a bundle/sale situation) and this fell way short.Also, in my opinion, replayability is not really there because there's only so much you can do with the weapon/ability upgrades per class. They top out way too fast and there's not a lot of depth, I guess you would say. The damage output and tolerance variance between classes is pretty crazy too.I hope there will be some DLC or other content on the horizon and if so, I may give it another spin and possibly change my recommendation. Until then, I really can't recommend you spend your cash on this title."

,Not Recommended,251230,25376147,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,Donde Jr.,"Pros:-Livelock is an immersive post-apocalyptic dystopian twin-stick shooter with RPG and psychological thriller elements. The main story asks the question, ""what if all of humanity depended on the collective consciousness of tumblr made manifest in the form of three teenage robots?"" What ensues is a deep introspective journey into the heart, as three friends find out what it means to be human. This coming of age saga delves with almost uncomfortably keen insight into the struggle for self-actualization that lies in the no man's land of middle school angst. Forget everything you thought you understood about the human heart, since this game will take you on a masterful journey through every high and low of the human experience.Cons:-Just slightly too long to get your refund."

,Recommended,251230,31584168,Posted: 6 May,all,NinjaBlu,"What is Livelock?Livelock is a very well made, third person twin stick shooter. While the campaign can be completed in a day, the game makes up for that in its other features. From its character design, to the destructible terrain, this game pays very close attention to its own detail.The CharactersLets start with the Vanguard; he is the definition of a bruiser. He prioritizes in melee combat, and has a variety of abilities to not only deal massive damage, but help him stay alive. His role in combat is to jump into the fray hammering into his foes with his fists and trying to keep enemy attention while his allies do what they do. Personally he's my favorite, punching is a lifestyle choice.Next is the one called Hex; he is this game's ranged dps, and boy is he good at it. Hex's role in combat is to flank the enemy while bombarding them with his devastating weapons. Unlike the Vanguard, Hex's survivability is rather low; he has some abilities he can use to escape and dodge enemy fire, but if you find yourself in a really tight spot, better hope your active camo is off cooldown.Lastly is the scientist called Catalyst; she is the bossy, big booty, supportive healer and packs a lot of crowd control. With her various abilities she is quite able to get into the fray and keep herself alive. While her damage is lower than the others, she excels at containing the enemy and keeping her allies healthy throughout the duration of combat. Also she looks like aunt fanny."
