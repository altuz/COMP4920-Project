,Not Recommended,251310,10143898,"Posted: 16 May, 2014",all,Kizzo Tree'aight,"The most boring game ever.Everything is slow and there is no excitement to anything. Make sure to turn ""NPC Threats"" off, because the only enemies are wolves that spawn when you pick up key items, and walking away from these wolves is pretty much the game forcing you to backtrack in order to despawn them which makes them just a waste of time. The setting is really dull too and moving around in it is clunky due to the bad controls. The worst part about the game is the gameplay itself, which is nothing but walking around in a large but empty world at a very slow pace. This makes finding items for puzzles and then bringing them to where you think they would work a major pain.About the puzzles: They are garbage. The game's progression is tied to you picking up one specific item after another, you pick an item up just to use it on the next item which will then let you do something to get another item. Missed an item? Better search everywhere while moving like a snail. Most of your time will be spent walking around an empty area clicking on everything to find that one item you need. Also, good luck finding the matches. Putting them inside a 80% opacity glass case on top of a grave was not the best idea.By the way, the game is not scary.EDIT: I read the Steam Store page for this game and got angry, so I'm gonna pick apart each point.--High detailed realistic graphics.Not really. The village itself is very boring and weird-looking (many of the houses are one room for some reason), and the forest area is plagued by bad pop-in problems with shadows. The same 3 moveable rocks are repeated throughout the whole game. The lighting is alright.--Explore open environment with realistic physics in the Greek countryside.""Realistic physics""? You mean like how you can put a chair through a solid wall if you move quick enough? How about whenever something moves along the floor or touches the floor, it makes the same sound at the same volume like 20 times in a row really fast and sounds like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The rocks are easier to throw than a glass jar in this game. Also, can you really call it an ""open environment"" when 90% of all the houses and buildings are locked?--Use stealth tactics and agility to survive.""Stealth tactics"" is wrong, it is a blatant lie. There is no stealth in this game, enemies show up out of nowhere and you'll never see them before they see you and start chasing you. And there is no running in this game, you walk and enemies walk at about the same speed. They chase you at a walking pace until the game decides to give up and despawn the enemy.--Use physics-based objects to defend yourself.This statement is solely meant to cover for the lies of the previous statement since running away and stealth are not an option to anyone who doesn't want to backtrack even more than they have to.--Challenging item–based Puzzles with simple interface.I already discussed the puzzles and why they suck, but the interface is also bad. You get like 12 item slots but you'll never come close to filling that since you use items after getting them. It looks and feels ugly and rushed.--Dark atmosphere with eerie sounds.What ""eerie sounds""? That doesn't even make sense because there are no eerie sounds at all, or anything close to that description. Also the dark atmosphere is not something to be proud of since it makes no sense either. The moonlight is so strong that it creates lightrays around every object, but  everything on the ground is still pitch-black???--Original storylineSonic fanfictions are also ""original storylines"", this is yet another meaningless statement.Don't buy it, not even on sale."

The graphics were stunning, the story was inventive if far too short, if you can find this on sale, I'd say the 4 hours of game play is worth the 10 dollars, but not much more.   The game was a bit too linear for an adventure and the clues left in game, made it almost too easy to progress through.  It could have been better with more content in it, some of which could have made the main story line a bit less easy to follow to quickly through.   There were a ton of unexplored houses left by the end, so over all why I liked it for a short diversionary game, it felt a bit more like a 3d based short story book, and less like a puzzeling adventure game."

At first I thought I might have grabbed it during the Halloween Sale, but no... no I hadn't. Instead, I purchased this game in the Be Mine 8 Indy Bundle several months ago.Seemingly they added Steam keys to that bundle, and I had redeemed it blidnly and totally forgot about the game until Steam Roulette picked it for the next game in the Backlog Blitz. So, that's the backstory into why I have this in my Steam Library. It also helps set the scene for the review.This game is pretty awful.I don't want to be harsh, but there's no real positive to this game. The story is disjointed and paper thin - and you'll see whatever surprise it suggets it might have coming a mile away.The controls are OK, but they're basic WSAD controls and mouse look. I guess it uses the Unreal Development Kit nicely, as at times the game does look nice. However, that's probably it.Everything about this game screams 'portfolio project' - a game that was made in an attempt to showcase talent in an attempt to get a job with a studio in the future. If I had made this game, I'd be somewhat happy with it... but I'd never try to sell it to people as a game. It's just not engaging enough.You'd probably be able to finish this game in 2 hours, if it wasn't for the horrible back and forth backtracking the game MAKES you do, and the frustratingly placed enemies that suddenly appear out of nowhere and hunt you down.Overall just avoid this game, don't even buy it as a temptation to see how terrible it is. Just avoid."

And take the advice of others here, turn NPC threat off.  Its unecessary and just adds annoyance.I love games like this.  I've been playing them since Myst all those years ago.  I enjoyed this one to a point.  Its definitely atmospheric and all.  Everything can be figured out without the use of any walkthrough unlike alot of these kinds of games.  BUT, the end was beyond disappointing.  It was sudden, predictable and frankly when the character we are playing says ""I have to make a choice"" there is no choice to make.  I wanted to NOT do what the game forced me to do.   I'm gonna go back in there and look again to make sure, but I really did not see where my other ""choices"" were.And another thing I really did not like about this game....  Save points.  Why in the world would you make a game like this and not allow a player to save the game when they need to?Bottom line is, I would recommend it if its on sale for very cheap.  It was fun figuring everything out and again, as I said it's one that you can piece together without a walkthrough or hints which is nice.

They appear to have vanished into the void, beyond the realms of my PC's feeble human mind. Clearly, that was the real conspiracy in this village -a bunch of cultists who just aren't very good at killing trespassers and covering up the evidence (the coffin wasn't even NAILED SHUT PROPERLY, guys!) trying to figure out where om earth this mythical blacksmith was supposed to be.This game has the rather dubious honour of being the first one I've ever refunded on steam. It had potential  -a horror game based in Europe, on an urban legend? Yes please, that sounds right up my alley! But this fell unfortunately short.Several of the games primary mechanics glitched for me -the torch never appeared in my trunk or inventory and the oil can got jammed in the river. I was unable to locate certain areas that should have been easy to find -specifically, the infamous blacksmith- my character continually got stuck on the geometry, puzzles were unintuitive, and the story, what little of it I saw, felt hackneyed.For the positives, the game did have a good atmosphere when it worked. The character models were not particularly stunning, but the setting was creepy and moody.  The game looks fine -the graphics are decent, if rather samey, and the experience is somewhat improved if you play with NPC encounters turned on. Though that said, these NPC's are ugly, badly animated, and encounters rarely add to the horror of the situation. They are more of an annoyance than a credible threatUnder other circumstances, and with fewer bugs, this could've been a game I found entertaining, if not memorable, but the bugs simply pushed it over the edge for me."

The only mystery I came across was why I was still playing this game. Let's first talk about the excitement factor. There is none. While failing to capture the atmosphere of similar games of this genre, it also manages to be painfully uninteresting. I don't have much to comment on the story because I didn't make it that far. Now, let's talk about the graphics. To my surprise, they are solid. Made my computer work quite hard. The graphics also found a way to annoy me though, so it didn't save my experience. I will give it a positive though... The controls felt pretty nice. I can see where the developers wanted this game to go. Sadly, it missed.. By a long shot.

It was a project with potential, but I sadly cannot recommend it. I completed the game in six hours, and a good portion of that was spent wandering around trying to figure out what to do next. A lack of hand holding is one thing, but providing little to no direction is quite another. But the big thing is that for me at least, Eleusis just isn't scary. And that's a pretty big failing for a horror game. Nearly all hostile encounters are scripted and you can clearly tell when you're in danger and when you're not. The plot is pretty thin and I saw the big twist at the end coming from a mile away. Maybe if the devs had had more time, money and/or staff, this could have been better, but as is I can't give it my seal of approval."

Eleusis just felt like more of the same in regards to first person horror, albeit reasonably crafted more of the same. Car breakdown? Check. Disempowerment early on? Check. Mysterious supernatural weirdness going on? Check and double check.To its credit, Eleusis looks pretty good visually. The environments feel natural enough as well, if a bit spread out. Thing is, the aimlessness of a lot of your searching, coupled with the cheapness of the things that -can- end your run once they start showing up, makes the whole struggle feel not all that worthwhile.  And struggle you will, as it takes a bit to get a feel for the map, and again, those cheap spawns of critters (and at least one dude) who feel like they have way more reach than they should.Once you get used to running like hell and whatnot, however, it's not too much of a hassle aside from finding some of the last items you need in the game. Expect to look down a lot, and have fun randomly slamming items together to get to that point in the first place. Things start getting unclear once you're in the second chapter, to put it kindly.If you've got a few bucks and want a slightly interesting story, maybe give Eleusis a chance, but it's not something very high-priority, whether or not you're a horror fan."

However there is the option to turn off the enemies which is an improvement but at that point the game just become a 1st person point and click adventure. There is a reason that point and click adventures are not usually 1st person, it is one thing attempting to use every item in your inventory with every object in a couple of screens it is quite another to do the same wandering through an entire village and surrounding forest. That is the defining characteristic of this game: the aimlessly wandering about. Oh and if you get bored of wandering about and want to take a break there is no manual save.

Many times, I find myself looking at a walkthrough to figure what I have to do next.  I don’t know what I’m looking for when there is no objective reminder to tell you what to look for.  The journal doesn’t help much; although the story progression is linear and the map isn’t all that big but it’s still an open world.

Games that do that concept well are games that are set up properly that give the player an idea on what to do next even if the game doesn’t guide them.  A good set up allows the player to figure out through some trial and error until they eventually figure out what to do next especially in a smaller controlled space where they are constantly doing something; unfortunately, looking for specific things in this big map, for example,not knowing that I had to look for a key under a matis more frustrating rather than a good challenge.The game length is decent.  Between 4-7 hours long.  The price tag is steep, however.  There are many games with similar dark atmosphere and longer content at a much cheaper price.  Still, that doesn’t mean this game should be avoided.  Dark moody games are games I love to try out whether it’s a walking simulator, action packed, jump scares or puzzle filled.  The positive qualities made this game appealing enough to finish the game.  With a guide, you can pass this frustrating flaw and continue with the story.  I give it a blue-thumbs up for good effort especially the voice acting.  It was nicely done.  I don’t recommend the game per se but rather say the game is worth a shot at a more lower price range."
