,Recommended,251370,8492459,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,Elfee,Escape Goat is a puzzle platformer. You play as a goat which is able to make high jumps and also to pile some rocks (for destroying them). You will meet a mouse really fast which becomes your friend. Only with the help of the mouse do you stand a chance because it is able to reach smaller places!Sometimes you can find also items for example a magical hat which is for your mouse. With that hat you can teleport to the places where you have sent your mouse.The aim is to clear rooms full of traps and machinery. You have to think how you can get all keys and to make it to the unlocked door after it.  You have 50 puzzles organized in 10 stages. Of course that isn’t much and if you are a strategic person you will make it really fast but this game is really enjoyable and classic.

After playing Escape Goat, I am not here to review a simple 2D puzzle platforming game. I am here to prove that this goat is a witch. Goats have long been known for their platforming prowess. They have always been able to scale tall mountains with ease. Like all goats, this one can dash forward to ram through breakable walls or extend a jump. Those are qualities that a normal goat possesses. This goat can double jump. There is no other goat that can jump in mid air.The meager purple goat that you see before you has broken out of our deepest, darkest prison within only three hours. All with the aide of a cohort mouse that believe it or not, this goat talks to! Not only that, but the goat can command this mouse. The goat can send the mouse running in a straight line, scaling up walls, traversing ceilings and hitting switches. It can even get placed under a sleep spell where it rests wherever this foul witch goat places it! Making it useful to rest on 'weighted switches' that need a body to hold them down. This heathenish goat can even toss its unwilling partner in escape upward where it can then cling on the ceiling and walk forward. The mouse can be instantly summoned back by the simple will of the goat.I would like to show the court evidence A. The magical hat I have just revealed allows the witch goat to change places with the mouse. Calling this hat magical is a farce! It isn't the hat that is magic, its the goat that makes the hat magic! The goat was able to have the mouse crawl through small areas and then teleport directly to them.There were still things that the goat couldn't possibly use his mouse ally for. Wall mounted switches that only the goat could touch. These switches lead to a variety of things. Both bad that enabled platforms to help the goat escape and good that started machine like traps. Walls that moved, floors that shifted. All the goat had to do was exit out of each room's open door. If the door wasn't open, the goat managed to find keys that it used to unlock the door. Sometimes six keys in one room and this goat managed to collect them all!Because of these talents, this magical goat may have escaped all 55+ rooms in this prison, but it cannot escape the arm of the law! This goat managed to escape its own cell block of five puzzling rooms. Then it made its way to the gathering place where it opened up new cell blocks. For every cell block the goat went through, it opened up two more cell blocks. It was able to go through each of the nine cell blocks consisting of five rooms each. All to rescue its sheep sisters from prison. After all that, the witch goat managed to escape nine final rooms of doom!Each cell block is themed and had even more danger, but the goat make it look easy and fun! One cell block of five rooms featured ice blocks. Blocks too cold for its mouse friend. Blocks that the goat managed to ram and push. Another cell block had hollow blocks that the goat could travel through, but other blocks stacked on top of. Razorblades spinning around platforms couldn't stop the goat! Nor could death reapers that throw fireballs when they spot the goat. Nor could fire breathing wall mounted sentries!Moving platforms, mechanized blocks, changing structures, rolling barrels that explode when lit on fire and walls that blew up when lit on fire. Nothing could stop this goat! How on this great Earth could one goat survive death like that? Well truth is, the goat never survived death. This goat is as fragile as your ordinary goat. Anything can kill it. Its magic that brought this goat back to life again and again! If the goat ever got trapped in a room. It could suicide, completely resetting the room. The rare times that the goat would fall into pits or be able to leave the room without exiting through the door, the goat respawned!After all this, the goat thinks it can make a better prison. It can somehow make blue prints and escape from a prison of its own invention! Well witch goat, you may have escaped from the easy prison, but after you made your 3 hour escape look easy, there is another prison waiting for you more brutal than the first! The additional prison has 28 more rooms in 4 cell blocks. All without having to spend more taxpayer money.I feel that I have proven my point your honor. We cannot have this goat walking among us in civilized society. May the good people of Steam find this goat guilty of being a witch and sentence it to prison!"

The graphics and sound are a fitting, pretty standard retro style, and the game mechanics are well-designed.Though it’s probably best characterized as a puzzle platformer, I found Escape Goat’s puzzling aspects to be pretty tame. In all but the last group of rooms, each puzzle tended to have a pretty obvious/straightforward solution. Let’s just say that if we were to build a difficulty scale for these types of games, Fire N’ Ice might be near the top, while this game would come close to defining the bottom end. Of course, it’s still a fun game, so I won’t concern myself too much with that.Verdict: It’s worth playing, but I probably won’t go back for the speedrun achievement (I hate speedruns in puzzle games), nor do I feel compelled to do the extra challenge levels that unlocked after the end of the game."

Its a super charming platformer that makes you think a lot about how to reach the exit. All levels are contained within one screen, but they mix up the mechanics often enough in the games ten different worlds to keep it interesting and challenging. I love the music in the game and while very simple the graphics suits the game very well. And who doesn't like a great pun as the name of the game?Strongly recommended!Pretty much all achievements in the game are for beating specific rooms in a specific way (such as limited moves or skipping some of the puzzle mechanics). It also has a speedrun achievement for beating the game in 45 minutes. And by beating the game it means that you need to beatThe final path(the last world of the game) so you only need to beat enough to unlock that and then go straight for it and it allows you to use a separate savefile for it so you can practice the levels, jump over to your ""speedrun save"" do that world and then switch back to your practice save and practice the next world.Time to 100%:~7 hours"

,Recommended,251370,14014312,"Posted: 16 January, 2015",all,Comrade St. Nikolai,"I first played Escape Goat on XBLI and instantly fell in love. It's a cute, but challenging puzzle platformer about a purple goat and a mouse with a sweetpimpmagic hat who must escape from some jerk's diabolical prison. To do this, they must travel through nine different areas to rescue the magical, slumbering sheep within, and then conquer one final extra-long area for good measure.Escape Goat has an interesting way about its levels. They're always shifting. Buttons and switches move blocks, barrels will roll, platforms move along tracks, and crates explode (usually in big chain reactions). Puzzles tend to involve trying to understand what will make what do what, and then making sure it all happens in the right order without getting yourself killed.The actual movement can be a little floaty, but you quickly get used to it. It's not a game-ruiner. Block-wide openings require some precision to get through that may cause a few deaths when you're in a hurry or just unlucky with your dash timing. Still not a game-ruiner, but occasionally annoying.There are enemies, but you can't kill them directly. You can often kill them indirectly, by using the environment creatively. In several spots, this can even gain you achievements. Which, by the way, aren't just your standard ""congrats you beat another level!"" fare. The majority of the achievements here are for completing levels in challenging ways. Many of these require you to do things that were clearly not intended when the game was originally released on XBLI, but which probably came to the dev's attention later on down the line. Barring a handful of annoying chievos, these add a good deal to the game, requiring you to think outside the box and push your skills to the limit.On that note, the overall difficulty of the game is pretty good. You've got a few easy warm-up levels, and then quickly get into the thick of it. Towards the end, you'll be putting your platforming skills to the test. If it's still not tough enough for you, don't fret. Once you complete the game, a bonus mode unlocks with four worlds of extra-challenging levels. A warning pops up to tell you that the going's going to get tough when you start it. And it's not kidding. I'm sure not finishing that without a walkthrough anytime soon.The game looks great! The dev understands the importance of color, something which pleases me greatly. There's a bit in the first Castlevania episode of Sequelitis about using colors that pop, and it's a lesson that I feel doesn't get taken to heart often enough. In Escape Goat, your goat is purple. Your mouse friend is orange. The environments use a variety of colors to keep your eyes focused. No slog through brownish grey ruins, here. I mean, there... there are some browns and greys. But you get what I'm saying.Maybe it's just me, but I think the music here shines above all else. Which is only natural, as the dev was originally a video game composer before getting into design, as well. There's a unique sound to the music of Escape Goat that I really can't describe very well. They should have sent a musician. I don't know if it's an echoey sound or, I dunno. Reverb? Something. Makes for some mysterious melodies, though, I can tell you that. Give it a listen onBandcamp, if you like. If that sounds like something you'd like to hear in a game, then this is that game, and you know where the purchase button is!The game contains a level creator, and you can play player-made levels by placing them into a certain folder on your computer. There's a stickied thread on EG's Discussions board that will tell you more.It's pretty short at about 3 hours for the initial campaign, with potential time extensions in the forms of the bonus campaign and player-made levels. It's also pretty cheap at only $5, which seems like a pretty good trade off. I can safely recommend the game at that price. If you're on the fence, $1.24 during a sale is honestly about as much of a steal as a steal can be. If you're dissatisfied at that price (you won't be), then I just don't know what you're doing with your life."

The level design even if kind of complex at times, never gets to be actually frustrating, even if 2 or 3 levels can take you a not so low number of attempts.The graphics do fit perfectly what would be outright retro rather than just pixelart alone (something plenty of people should learn the proper definition of both), not breaking sprite sizes or their self impossed colour limitations, which never interfere and only help how you read the maps (which is something I see multiple sidescroller games screwing up). And let's not forget the kickass soundtrack.The only problem I have with the game is the free expansion it comes with. It isn't bad, but the level design clearly follows a different philosphy, and one that is a lot more trial and error, which for a 1 room type of level system is fine on itself, being able to see the entire of the map from the start, but unfortunately it has a lot of areas that require really precise timing on top of the puzzles themselves, which in the end do end up feeling frustrating."

Few puzzles rely on sheer timing, although many utilise automation as a timer or to flow you along. Certain elements of this can be confusing to begin with as its never especially clear what is going to affect what so it can be a little disheartening to need to learn through failure constantly.I dont consider myself any sort of don regarding puzzle games, however I felt Escape Goat was a touch short. Most early rooms feel little more than filler -- the gentle difficulty I mentioned before -- and it is not until the final area does the game really make you stop and consider your actions. I cant accurately gauge whether I felt enjoyment more from solving the puzzles or simply going through the motions in order to progress.That said, the post-game is where anyone who enjoys cracking toughies may find the most enjoyment. They kick the difficulty up to eleven, throw you on your knees and tell you to get to work.

The puzzles are too easy, which isn't normally too big a problem since the platforming is fine and reasonably fun, but there's a lot of levels where the simple puzzles are also a bit time-consuming. So that, even if you know the puzzle, it can still take a while - predominantly from deaths. And if there's a mini-puzzle before a hard platforming section, expect to be highly annoyed. It would've benefitted greatly with checkpoints or somesuch.That being said, maybe if the puzzles are easier for you you'll enjoy it?

The game is good, but the extreme retro graphics make my eyes sore. This isn't the first retro puzzler on steam. This isn't even the first goat simulator on steam, but it is enjoyable none-the-less. The levels are well designed and with one notable exception any deaths you get in a level are from your own mistakes. Having said that, the controls need to be perfect in a game like this and unfourtunately are a little bit rough in this game. Thankfully its nothing too problematic. Another issue is the game's length. It is really short for the money payed and so I cannot recommend this except if there is a sale. You are better off getting Escape goat 2 instead if there is no sale."

It never uses it's retro stylings as an excuse for bad design - like Doom, it feels like a game that not only lives up to modern standards but will have aged very well ten years from now.The one-room level design is consistently clever and always uses it's different pieces in new and unexpected ways. The instant respawn means it's rarely frustrating, it's moderately challenging but easy to understand your many mistakes, and the controls are strong enough that 99% of your deaths are your fault.On top of that, the soundtrack is catchy and memorable and even the sound design is very well done - the chime when you collect a key, for example, is so satisfying that I can hear it while I'm typing this. And although the graphics are simple, they'll grow on you as very charming in their own right - it looks so much better than most retro-styled games that the HD graphics in EG2 almost feel like a step down.It's not perfect, of course. If you prefer games that last for dozens of hours, the basic game lasts only a few -  just long enough that it largely avoids getting gimmicky or repetitive. There are achievements, a set of obscenely brutal bonus levels, and custom level sets that can keep you playing for a long while, but none of them really live up to the original game.Some of the levels are also less clever than others, particularly some of those in The Endless Machine that fall into the trap of trial and error puzzle design. Others rely far too much on reflexes, which doesn't suit this game particularly well - although the controls work well, your goat isn't really built for twitch platforming.But, really, those are minor problems. When the game is great, it makes you remember why you fell in love with the genre in the first place  - and it's that great for nearly every minute you spend with it. It wasn't a recent obsession of mine for nothing!"

Some puzzles are simply guesses, or dying repeatedly until you finally figure it out (I had to YouTube only ONE puzzle, but that single one drove me crazy...)  But, it's a game with replayability, where you can challenge yourself to beat the game in a much, much shorter time with a lot fewer deaths.  Also, there are multiple solutions to some of the puzzles, adding a chance to discover new, and different ways to play.Expect anywhere from 1-5 hours for your first playthrough, depending on how fast the puzzles click with you, and how succesful you are at actually carrying out the solution."

None of the elements here, from the graphics to the sound to the gameplay itself, would feel out of place on an SNES or Genesis.  I appreciate that (apparent) fidelity to the limitations of those older systems, especially when it's become popular to market any game with affectedly pixelated graphics as ""8-bit"". If you're nitpicky about stuff like that, you'll probably appreciate Escape Goat.As for the actual gaming element: it's fun, reasonably challenging, but it feels like it will be over too soon (I'm probably about 3/4 of the way through); I had to quit, pace myself, so I wouldn't finish it in one sitting. I want to savor the goat. The good news is, it comes with a level editor, so the goat action never has to end!Also: it's about time we had a game where you get to play as a goat.

76561197983662248,Recommended,251370,11309665,"Posted: 18 July, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: Normally, I add a header to these reviews, but since it often times made the review too long to submit, I've left it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: Well, the idea isn't terribly new. It's a puzzle-platformer with a retro aesthetic. Also, there really wasn't anything that really blew me away about the game. However, don't think that this game is bad because of that. It's actually a very solid game with excellent level design (with a few exceptions and another part that I'll talk about later). As far as the controls and mechanics go, this game keeps things rather simple. You are, as you might guess, a goat. You also have a mouse companion with you that you can use to distract the enemy (there's only one type of enemy, but that's okay; combat doesn't exist in this game) or send into narrow corridors to do various things. You can send out the mouse and call it back at any time, and there exists a power up in some levels that allows you to switch positions with the mouse.The levels themselves do make a great deal of use of the mechanics and are very good about introducing concepts without tutorializing you to hell and back. While there are a few levels that don't feel like puzzles at all or are rather easily broken, I'd argue that about 90% of the levels are well thought out and cleverly designed. All in all, there's about 50 levels in the game, with the exception of the extra chapter that you probably shouldn't play.This chapter is called All Intensive Purposes, and after one level I stopped playing it because of the immense bad taste just one level left in my mouth. That level was the first level of a chapter called Death Row, and it's pretty much an unfair piece of garbage. The problem comes from the fact that the event triggers for the level are invisible. Likewise, a lot of these triggers create unpredictable effects that can completely ruin your progress. Yes, there's even a pretty much unavoidable death trap at the end of the level that made me stop playing. There's a difference between difficult and unfair. Maybe there were better levels later on in the chapter, but after spending about 20 minutes trying to beat that level, only to be screwed over by an unavoidable death trap at the end. After how expertly crafted most of the main stages were, a level like that felt like an insult followed by a slap to the face.Apart from that, though; the game itself is very fun and very enjoyable. It is a fairly short game, clocking in at just over two hours for the main stuff for me, but for quite a few very clever puzzles that actually feel rewarding to solve, $5 is a very good value. 8/10.Story: You am goat leave prison fast much. Yeah, no point rating it.Graphics: As mentioned earlier, this game goes for an 8-Bit aesthetic. The pixel art isn't exactly impressive, but it's not bad either. The animations are smooth, it's easy to differentiate between things, and it's pretty functional while not looking lazy or bland. For the technical aspects, the game launches with the option of fullscreen or windowed. The game fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without a hitch, so you probably shouldn't have many issues (if any at all). Overall, the graphics style isn't gonna blow anyone away, but the animations are good and the game works perfectly on a technical level. 3/5.Sound: Pretty much just music to talk about here, and man oh man, does this game have a good soundtrack. Whoever Chainsaw is, ya did good. The only complaints I can make (and they're minor) is that the songs do get reused for a couple of sections and one of the songs loops weirdly. Other than that, this soundtrack is worth getting on its own merits. 5/5.Overall scores are: 8/0/3/5; cumulative score of 8.0/10. Definitely a very solid game that is worth your time and $5."

Many of the puzzles in the initial game are simple enough with a few challenging levels here and there that can be completed without being killed too terribly much and the first set can be completed within a couple of hours tops.  Once you've completed this fun set of levels, you unlock the extreme difficulty set of levels in another zone.  These appear to be designed more toward the crowd that likes rage games as the difficulty takes a massive spike upward for these.  Expect to die nearly non-stop on the extreme levels.  I have no idea if there is a third set of levels past the second group as the second group feels nearly impossible to complete, and I'm a veteran gamer.The music is pretty great and goes well with the game.  This is a good thing since you'll be hearing the same tracks a lot once you reach the extreme difficulty.Controls feel a little floaty at times, especially when you're trying to make precision jumps to small platforms.  It gives you a tendancy to either fall short of your jump or slide past it.  This can lead to some minor frustration in the easy levels and be downright infuriating in the extreme levels.Level design is really good.  It feels like they could have included an intermediate set of levels to help smooth the transition along to the extreme levels.  That's assuming the extreme levels aren't actually the intermediate ones, though I can't imagine how that would be possible given how incredibly hard the game got after the easy set.Overall this is a great little 2d platform puzzle game that everyone should at least give a try.  Unless you're a completionist or masochist, I wouldn't recommend doing more than taking a cursory look at the extreme difficulty levels once you're through the easy set as you'll be beating your head against the game for what feels like hours just to complete a single room at that point."
