Loved the original paper based RPG, so I felt compelled to try this little strategy game which looks like a turn based X-com style game.  After reading how it is supposed to function in the in game guide, I still cannot get my soldiers to do more than walk around.  They will not target or shoot enemies.  When you attempt to select an enemy target, it does select the enemy; however, it is as if it simply jumps to an information screen about that enemy while forgetting the original player's unit who was supposed to be 'targeting' the enemy unit.  Thus no attack options pop up.  Reading some of the producer's website, it sounds as if this might have been developed as a touchscreen tablet ap game, where it may work well for all I know.  I'm not a touchscreen tablet user.  I have a PC.  I opted out of the 'new' Windows experience, not wanting a glorified tablet operating system on my PC, and I do not have a touch screen on my PC.  The game currently feels unplayable.  I may tinker with it enough to get it to 'unwieldy,' or I may just save the data space on my HDD, as I don't feel much need to trouble shoot games that are supposedly post production.[After more effort to play and to respond to some comments]:Oh I've done both.  There is some sort of indeterminate lag on input in this game that makes no sense at all.  The UI in this game is TERRIBLE.  Appearance is fine, but over half the time it doesn't detect the presence of the cursor over a button, or, alternatively, it simply doesn't register most mouse clicks.  Since there is no UI feedback to let you know you _are_ hovering over the hotspot for a button, it's anyones guess as to which is the case.  I have finally got to see a targeting box, or I'd have deleted long ago.  A diehard Cthulu or Lovecraft fan might tolerate this game, and I don't feel cheated at the price I payed for it since I am a Lovecraftian, but most 70's Atari games had better response/detection of user input than this game does, AND IT'S NOT EVEN REAL TIME, it's a turn based strategy game.  Clicking a random number of times from 2 to 20 to get the game to acknowledge input, from character upgrade screens, dialogue screens, and combat turns doesn't make for smooth game play.  Feels like the developers were pushed to roll the product out before it was fully play tested, like most EA products are done.  Don't really expect that in indie type games."

Which is absolutely titanic in size and im going to be comparing this Sadly but Admitably Inferior Product to. I feel like ive gotten my moneys worth in this game, i'll try the DLC another day but here is my two cents.The people who are complaining about the game's controls in the reviews are pretty stupid, sure i found problems initally with UI where clicking anything didn't work. Restarted and worked flawlessly. Following the Tutorial, for people who don't get it. You CLICK YOUR UNIT that you want to attack with and then RIGHT CLICK on the enemy you want to attack, you can keep the Attack Tab up at the same time, so you can change weapons which is nice. You can also tilt the game environment with the arrows at the side of the screen. (You know, the ones that are sorta spinning.) Its inconveienent but its not all that bad. The funny thing is if you actually listen to the tutorial it explains it, i think the tutorial should be implimented into the campaign rather than a option of the latter as it helps alot with the UI.The Combat for the most part is about pushing forward and keeping the team together, if you go in thinking this is like XCOM you will get thrashed by trying to camp in the later levels. The enemies will just continually respawn at certain points until you know nothing but multiple Cthuhid's (Like im telling you what THAT is!) crushing you into dust. Its barely XCOM as we know it, Overwatch is no longer a command you can initalise, instead you simply hold left over points for Overwatch and to my knowledge they do not pass over to the next turn of play. Which means you should leech every single action point out of your characters to maximise efficency. Otherwise your just going to lose it shooting a creature you don't want to shoot at, which is already in your line of sight. Some of the Enemies in the game are strictly for tanking, and they will become a serious hazard if you don't get your guys with shotguns upgraded. Melee units are literally amazing against the later Cthuhids later in the game, but look absolutely silly with a guy with a tiny shovel taking down a abberation half his size.Sanity becomes a Massive issue towards the end of the game, nearly all your soldiers will go insane if you do not have either your investigators a Sanity Restoration book on them. Also max up any Sanity based ablities as they will help you later on. The enemy pacing is nice, and i like how the gameplay becomes from fighting humans to outright nightmares, especially the slow leaning on taking Sanity more seriously above Mustard Gas protection.Its enjoyable but might be frustrating for those who just aren't used to turn based strategy games. You need to plan things out for the long run, looking over the map design and finding what route is easier. I'd say Gas Masks are redundant once you've got your main soldiers kitted out and your investigators their own Gas Masks, especially towards the end of the game. Its also pretty important you build your team specifically to synergise with each other and to keep pushing forward. As long as your team compliments each other, you will always be moving forward or at least working towards a end goal.Gameplay however has plenty of flaws, the Lack of a Cover System makes human combat rather awkward, moments where your not sure if a bit of a building is cover or a small cubby hole to shoot through are plenty and there are a few hinderance with UI but i found the game pretty much doesn't really have too many of them and looks simple to fix with a simple patch.The Graphics are a major problem, i mean they look okay for the asthetic but they could defintely be more repulsive or have something more to it. I Appreciate the attempt by the developers but it is definitely not a pretty game and i feel if they put more into the actual graphics, it'd look okay. They aren't really what get in the way.The Story isn't all that interesting but its not completely dull, often there are these particularly tense( or Annoying.) Sections where your Main Protagonist is taken into a small dream and forced to do a stand against various foreshadowing creatures. Its nice to see it and i found it short but a good way to earn some extra xp, which your going to need. The Antgonist is rather forgettable sadly, i don't really see why he has much of a story to begin with. Im much more interested into one of the investigator's Backstory.(Not going to spoil it for those who are really into this.) Im not going to spoil things but the locations are vaguely interesting, its nice to see a WW1 Scene rather than the sorts of horror locations i typically expect in games these days.The Music and Voice Acting is next to non-existent, which for a £3 Game.. Im not complaining. I didn't expect to have that much fun with it as i did, but i was pleasantly surprised, being both a XCOM fan and a Fan of the Original works so it practically screamed BUY to me.Its £3, or $5. Seriously, i can think of ice cream more expensive than that and ive had alot more fun with this game than any amount of Ice Cream ive dared to eat.(Yes you can use that on the cover or Whatever.)I think with a few gameplay tweaks, a massive improvement to graphics and sound. Overall a larger and higher quality game, you have a potential competitor to XCOM with a great universe to base itself from.TL:DR?I Recommend, Lots of Fun for the strategy fan, Cheap ($5 People! 5!) and Short piece inbetween bigger titles. Needs Gameplay Overhauls and a even bigger Graphical Overhaul, with sound for a potential sequel for PC, otherwise."

It's a good game, but short and sweet. It has it's replay value, but for most people, once you finish it you probably won't be touching it again, save for the extra missions. As a game, it holds up well, although it's not entirely faithful to the Mythos (we all know that the invesitgators would get their s*** slapped by these things). But, relating to the Call of Cthulhu tabletop game by Chaosium? These are all characters you may very well expect to see in any other CoC tabletop campaign.I'd say that if you're looking for a quick game with some interesting survival elements and a fun battle system, pick this one up.

I won't speak much to writing and presentation, since the controls kept me from progressing very far. They are wildly unintuitive, it seems no consideration was given to updating them for PC gamers.The many, many developers now porting their smartphone games to the Steam marketplace really need to realize what works on one device does not always work for another. Taking the time to fix up your release for the new audience will earn you a lot of mileage, and a lot less negative reviews."

,Not Recommended,251390,25821924,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land is a turn-based strategy title with minor RPG elements. As you may have guessed from the name, the game is based off of H.P. Lovecraft's works within the Cthulhu Mythos; it also features some narrative based off of Herbert West - Reanimator. Since the developer/publisher Red Wasp Design Ltd	have disband, this title has been disabled for purchase on the store page. That being said, there are keys still floating around if you truly wish to buy or trade for it.Set in the year 1915 during World War I, you will control a team of investigators and soldiers who have been sent on a mission to investigate the Cult of the Awakened. The head of the cult, Docktor Kaul, has stolen the reanimation technology from Herbert West and he has combined it with arcane mythos magic in order to raise a powerful undead army using the casualties from The Great War. Docktor Kaul wants to eliminate all of humanity to make room for a new, superior, hybrid species; half human, half Star Spawn of Cthulhu.I'm personally a huge fan of Cthulhu and H.P. Lovecraft in general. It saddens me to say that this game is abysmally boring; what you see in the trailer is pretty much what you get. The environments are almost soundless, the gameplay is excruciatingly slow-paced, the dialogue is uninteresting, and the level designs are dull with a good chunk of them featuring trenches. From the screenshots and trailer on the store page, you may think that you will be playing in a semi-open world, but in reality the maps are suffocatingly small. All of this makes sense once you know that Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land is a mobile port, one that surprisingly won a few awards.A lot of people have had problems with the mechanics of the game, but if you take the Basic Training course at the beginning they're much easier to understand. They're still pretty awful controls, but at least there is a small tutorial. If you left click an enemy, the screen jumps to it and reveals all of its stats; you have to right click it to attack. Each investigator/soldier has a set of numbers that indicates their health, action points, and sanity. Action points are used to move around the map and attack monsters, and they can be reset by ending your turn. The sanity points go down each time the character attacks and/or gets hit by a foe that is not of the human variety.If a character runs out of sanity, they either freeze up for several turns or go in to a manic mode, dealing a ton of damage but then they become incapacitated afterward. If you fail to revive an incapacitated team member, they die within a set number of turns; this can also be said for when all health points are depleted. If a ""main member"" dies, you must restart the entire level again. Some levels also have a limited amount of turns that can be expended before the level will end in a game over. In many cases, you must also wait X amount of turns for one of the main investigators to research something before you can move forward.Each investigator and soldier can have two weapons, two items, and two pieces of armor; the further progress you make in the game, the more weapons, items, and armor that you unlock. However, you must purchase these things from the store at the end of each level. Likewise, you also spend any earned experience points at the end of a level. You only get one massive sum of XP, it is not divided up per character. Honestly, the game is made easy even on hard difficulty if you just put all of the XP into the rifle weapon for each character, and buy rifles for each of them. They do the most damage, and have the longest range. It's a huge loophole that negates almost any challenge that this title could've had.Overall, the most irritating thing about this title is the fact that every single time you attack an enemy, the screen has to jump to center on it; even if you're just a couple of steps away. The timing isn't always the same, so while your eyes are expecting the quick motion and follow through with it, it doesn't happen, leaving your eyes to constantly want to dart all over the place. This lovely feature, combined with some of the most dry and dusty gameplay ever conceived, makes Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land hard to recommend even to the most avid H.P. Lovecraft fan.Rating:2.0/5.0- It's not awful, but it's not great.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

,Recommended,251390,14348261,"Posted: 5 February, 2015",all,Azghouls,"H. P. Lovecraft entertained us with stories of madness and the unknown back in the early 20th century. Known for his works of ‘The Shadow out of Time and ‘At the Mountains of Madness’, his other work, ‘The Call of Cthulhu’ is what this game is based on (obviously). Now a registered trademark of Chaosium Inc, this game is centred on The Call of Cthulhu RPG. Originally made for the iOS, the ported PC version is quite reasonable, despite its apparent handset limitations as there are no real extra features to take advantage of the PC. Yet it’s entertaining enough to finish due to its tactical nature.The game itself has eleven missions and each one can take about an hour or so. Also note that even though the maps are quite small, it’s the nature of turned based combat that makes it longer. And as mentioned before, each mission will test a variety of skills therefore boredom won’t come easily. That said, because it’s a ported game, it’s a decent one at that however it could benefit more if the game has added features to compliment the PC world and not a direct copy from the mobile world, as highly evident from the user interface. But it’s certainly a decent game to play despite the lack of features that you come to expect from a good turned based game like Silent Storm, Gorky or the Jagged Alliance series. Plenty of love was poured into this game so it’s a worthwhile trip that pays respectable homage to H. P. Lovecraft.Full review here:http://www.gamespot.com/call-of-cthulhu-the-wasted-land/user-reviews/2200-12633514/7.5 / 10"

First, this game is more of an arcade game rather than a deep strategic squad based tactical game. And the second thing is that it is a low price game. What this means is that while the game doesn't have lots of features and options, the things it does have however are quite well done.I would say that the average person would play this game twice, first time for the story and the second time to perfect the squad build to maximize their potential. But for such a low price the game is worth the experience you get from it.

The graphics are a bit dated and ugly (which is fair, considering that the popular imagination of World War I is fairly drab/ugly). It immediately introduces fun stock characters, and the idea of a trench based tactical role-playing game with tons in common with Chaosium's table-top roleplaying game. The biggest frustration I had when I started was that I couldn't figure out how to look around the map further than the immediate area my characters inhabited, but this was later resolved.My 3 hours: Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land is divided into a number of missions, following the story of a British Company working alongside a professor of antiquities(or whatever Lovecraftian professor stock character he was) fighting against the evils of a German Cult. The missions are somewhat challenging, and often involve shifting circumstances, but basically break down into the same rhythm that X-Com players may remember. Moving from cover to to cover, setting up overwatch, covering advances, flanking, etc. This is all made more interesting by  the specificity of the setting , and the challenges of trench warfare.Between missions, there is an interface for advancing characters, which are broken down between redshirt types and mission-critical characters, all of which can die. Their stats and skills were very familiar to me, being based on what appears to be a simplified version of Chaosium's venerable and popular Call of Cthulhu tabletop roleplaying system. (All skills are based on percentages, which stats are similar enough to how they work in D&D for most people to be able to parse it without breaking too much of a sweat.) The characters have a varied skillset, and the story that I played through seemed interesting enough. When I hit my three hour mark, I found myself honestly wishing for more.HighMy Highlight: For me, the highlight of my experience was a challenging mission that took up most of my 3rd hour of play. In this mission, my band of troops and assorted weirdos (including a psycho-analyst, professor, and martial artist(beefy white guy with mutton chops and a club) had to fight their way through trenches, poison gas, zombies and machine-gun armed Germans to a church, which we had to defend from Germans and Zombies while our professor figured something out inside. It was tense, and consistently felt like I was being pushed to the limits of the resouces I had available. Just a really well designed(and fairly challenging mission)My Verdict: I strongly recommend this for x-com/final fantasy tactics/Lovecraft nerds like myself. For others, your mileage may vary, as the corniness or the rough edges might be a bit overwhelming.My next post will come in roughly 2 weeks, where I'll be covering Chivalry:Medieval Warfare"

Looking at the complaints mentioned, I myself did not actually get any of the described errors, although this may be due to it already getting fixed by the time I brought the game.As for the control issues mentioned, it is answered by playing the tutorial mission, as already said by previous comments.I do advise playing this on hard though, to get the challenge that some others are demanding. For the price paid it was able to keep me entertained to the very end, and was a fun introduction to the cthulhu mythos.As for gameplay, let me say that mustard gas is a pain, one slot of inventory for each character will always be taken up by a gas mask, but it does fit with the time period the game is set, and and really shows how much gas was an ever present threat in WW1. At 'Hard' the game throws hordes at you who are supported by ranged shooters, but good positioning  and selective targeting can whittle down the undead hordes, so you can then focus fire on the damn tanks. I did not notice what others mentioned though about contstant respawning enemies. I found you could clear an area of all enemies, and unless you move on to the next event trigger, the map would stay clear. My advice, at the very beginning focus on raising individual weapon specialties of each character up to at least 65+ and train up someone on the machine gun fast. For the rest of the game focus on doubling up on essential skills, like medics, and psychiatry. Get your action points up so you can fire your shotgun wielders twice, by end game and you should be able to handle any horde at Hard. Also,characters going crazy can be just as helpful or harmful depending on whether they end up manic or paralysed, but a manic shotgun wielder is a thing of beauty... =)"

Yes it is a mobile/tablet port, but thats not inherently a bad thing. Yes, the controls need getting used to, but some people who comment didnt actually read how this game or the controls work and just started bashing it because it doesnt work like a ""standard"" game. And you dont need to be Einstein to figure out the controls.. Most bugs have been fixed I think. Playing it through I had 1 crash in 18 hours.... thats less than many AAA titles and other than that no problems.. Dont believe reviews of people who played this game less than 2 hours... because there isnt much to review except you played it on easy and in that case you shouldnt complain that it is easy... Yes, the buttons dont always react the first time you click on them, but that doesnt matter too much in a turn-based game.If you like the works of Lovecraft and like turn based tactical games you cant go wrong with this game at the current price. Took me 18hours to complete the game on hard (but I didnt want to lose investigators permanently) and now Im going to try the extra missions (6 more missions).

I could hardly not play The Wasted Land.Basically, the game is an old-school tactical RPG: your squad has action points (AP), moves on a grid-based move, and fights endless hords of German soldiers/cultists/abominations.The usual mechanics you'd expect to find in a tactical RPG are here: your units will try to shoot at targets within range during the opponent's turn if they have enough AP, terrain and armor have an effect on how quickly your units are out of action points, etc.Truth be told, this isn't the best game of the genre. The interface is atrocious - even upgrading or equiping your men between missions is a pain -, and the maps are more often than not too open and too small, meaning you usually can shoot at everything right from the start.I'm also wondering why the developpers took two dark themes (the Great War and lovecraftian madness), yet decided to treat it lightly. The pulp/comic book tone isn't really fitting here, in my opinion.But overall, given how cheap this game is, and how much, simple, honest fun I had with it, I could hardly not recommend it.

Its hard depending on how you play games.Next is you need to know that your investigators are normal humans who have fear of the unknown. things that are not  human or once was human. when your sanity drops u either turn to be a rambo mode that will the next turn or will be paralized so you need careful planning w/ psychology.Wargears are limited and only offers upgraded version of the weaker counterpart that earns lots of action points so you need careful planing here for better resource allocation. Armor..... honestly i played w/ just steel helmets and leather vest as standard issue w/o any problem. Magic - the stuff that works miracles BUT loses sanity. probably bring health of R'yle in one and just use med packs on the others. Just make sure you take cover as much as possible since it dictates the difference between life and death.tho i like to warn most people graphics wise its not the best in the market but it will give you a warm but Decent textures and environment. tho i see most of the time are Browns.the Music is nice but not my cup of tea.pros->challenging - keep the advantage of positioning of troops , proper stat allocation and wargear upgrades.>works well in my 7 year old PC running in WinXPSP3>very few bugs encountered.>cuthulu mythos and WW1>Sigmund Freud (the interpretation of dreams AKA LIBIDO)Cons-> game is very short you can finish it in 2 days once you get the hang of it and if you play 18 hrs a day you can finish it faster> the music (in my opinion its the stuff where denizens of the warp materializes and where daemons of the ruinous powers brings you nightmares)> the screen rotation may not be your friend it tends to be either viewing things from length or width.> hard difficulty is not really hard but just a bit slightly tweaked mobs.overallfor casual gammer 5/10 since they wont probably delve deep in the mechanics and will be bored out after spening the next clip of your mousser hitting the air or the dust and not your enemiesfor Turn based strategy fans 8.5/10 some concept are solid and new but is hard to learn the ropes at firstfor WW1 fans 7/10 as the bloody brits you only see jerries and strum troopen at first and will be flooded w/ tentacales later.for Cuthulu and lovecraft fans 9/10 . its a gem story is solid sound is alluring (for my friend)so why do i reccomend this game.... i bought this on sale. installed and i enjoyed this. not much replay value tho after you earned all the achivement and finished all the modes.PS ""the forces of good needs to win every time but the forces of darkness only needs to win but once for the sleeper to awaken and this realm will be His"""

Playing on the side of the Old Ones is a unique challenge as you have to dash to the exit and use your allies as sacrifical pawns. I highly recommend this game to anyone with a love of all things Lovecraft :3.

The game is not too long to finish. However, the translation, especially the french one (I'm French, and I should have chosen the English language instead), is not particularly successful and so is inconvenient, despite the fact that the dialogs remain undestandable anyway. A favorite."

I played through the etire campaign and only ran into one bug that required a quick exit out and restart of the program. All I can figure it the game must have been patched since its release, or just don't know how to set their resolution.All in all, Call of C'thul'hu: The Wasted Land is a delightfully fun little turn-based tactical squad game that has you leading your team of heavily armed investigators through the crater and poison-gas strewn hellscape of WW1 to stop a cult from using the fields of the dead to create their own army and literal hellscape.The plot and gameplay refreshingly straightforward. Use XP and money earned every stage to upgrade your investigators and fight your way to the end and kill a big bad to death without losing too many redshirts along the way.The challenge might seem a bit light to some, as I've never been able to beat X-Com but was able to beat this on normal while losing only a single redshirt along the way.The campaign isn't very long, maybe 8-9 hours to beat, but it can be easily enjoyed in bite-size pieces (much like your investigators) and for $5 you're probably not going to do much better."

Looks are good and idea seems to have lots of  potential for fans of turn based games. However, overall this is very disappointing as the controls are quite poor and the game has the feel of a tablet based game and struggles to escape its mobile / tablet origins. So overall needs a further choice between recommend / not recommended - maybe worth a look if you like the genre, but even them only if it is discounted. Nice idea, worth a run through, but overall a waste of potential."

If you're a fan of squad turn-based game or H.P. Lovecraft's works then this is for you. Shame there aren't more games like this.On the negatives, the UI is a bit clunky and occasionally the music will cut out, but other than that for the asking price it's a very enjoyable if tough experience."
