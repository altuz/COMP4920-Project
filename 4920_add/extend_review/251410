This game was fun to play, and had a very interesting story to tell. But ultimately, the game is just... incomplete.I'd find locked doors with enemies on the other side that I thought would have to be backtracked later. I had mission objectives that I couldn't complete yet, and thought I'd loop around to it. I'd see undiscovered areas on the minimap that I thought would reopen later. But ultimately, none of it amounted to anything. It was just incomplete.As a game, it was fun. I'm sure the developer is just as miserable about this as we are. Dark Matter could have been amazing, but he just didn't manage to get enough kickstarter funds to make it happen. I feel for him, and I do actually hope you readers buy this game, if only to support a potential sequel. But at face value, upon completing this game, can I recommend it? With a heavy heart... no."
,Not Recommended,251410,8814181,"Posted: 22 January, 2014",all,Baduncadunc,"The chilling introductory narrative was what really drew my interest in the game, but indeed like many reviews say, it's sadly not a particularly good game. Most of this has to do with it being incomplete; what you do have is a bit light, if shallow, in substance and ends rather abruptly before it gets anywhere particularly interesting and memorable.With another year or two in development, this would have really come around to be a good, memorable title. It set the stage for an engrossing sci-fi horror story. I was most impressed with the narrative. I was drawn in. Almost enamoured. But overall I felt rather let down, even after the ending sequence was later added to the game as a free update.Perhaps they can give it another shot in the future, or this would translate better as a book.Alien design, sound, and visuals - was all fairly average. But I won't really get into it - upon some reflection, I don't really know if this is even worth reviewing, considering it's not clearly not a finished, or ready, product. And with that said, it's probably not worth buying or spending time on. It's a real shame I am saying this.If you haven't already, stop and take a moment to enjoy what I consider to be the best part about this game - the opening cinematic trailer, right here on Steam. Then move on and look for something else."

It is part one of a series of games that was abandonned before this one was even sold, meaning the full game being advertised was already canned before it went on sale.It's still an interesting play and can have a little fun playing it, but it's short, and like I keep re-iterating, it's not finished.. From the very beginning it starts foreshadowing an ending you will never reach, a move up through the ship toward the command section that never gets completely out of engineering, so it's part 1 of a 4 or 5 part story that barely gets started.They came around, due to the outrage on the forums and eventually put in a super-brief, cinematic excuse for an ending, but it's still not what was advertised and does nothing to bring a conclusion to the story that the game starts.I want to like it, but all I can feel about this game is ripped off.At less than $5, I'd say go ahead and give it a try if you can like this sort of game, but more than that is horribly over priced for this short teaser of a game that never will be."

It's an incomplete version that was tossed out the door when the Kickstarter failed in order to salavage a little cash. Whilst there is promise in what little there is, it's very short and ends abruptly (The ending has since been patched, but I gether there's little improvement.The version I played had a tutorial level which instructed you on features that never actually appeared in the game. Obviously these were intended to be included but when the money ran out they were omitted, but the tutorial wasn't updated to refect that.If you drop by the discussion area you can see the many complaints from those that paid for what they thought was a full game met with evasion, protests and (to be blunt) outright fibs from the publisher and developer that this was intended to be an episodic franchise, despite the fact it was not labelled as such in any description, and, more damningly, the 'final product' was identical to the demo given out when the kickstarter launched.It's also worth noting that the publisher blamed the QA department for the complete lack of a proper ending (The original release of the game just ended when you enter a room and you were met with a couple of paragraphs of text saying you died), not, say, the developers for not actually doing things properly. It's the kind of desperate buck-passing that I might have found funny had I not paid to play it.I have to say I'm disappointed that Steam brough it back after it was pulled.

I'll start with those. The visuals are gorgeous. It's dark and creepy with detailed interesting backgrounds. Sometimes you see things skittering around in the background or even in the foreground. Lights flicker, fleshy growths pulsate, and monsters look good. The overall theme of the game is well done. You feel as though you are alone on a dead ship with an infestation of ravenous alien lifeforms. I have no complaints about the sound or soundeffects and was very pleased with the voice of your AI guide. It sounds gritty and electronic with just a slight hint of emotion to it which I thought fit the mood very very well.Gameplay has some nice features. Your light has some impact on the creatures in the game. Some traps close when light is shined upon them while others explode or release poison gas when lit up. Hive tunnels spawn creatures when light shines on them. Additionally because of this dependency on light you can shoot out hallway lights, flares, etc... to make the area dark. I was dissapointed, however, that there was no mechanic for placing flares or something to create a light source even if it would only be temporary. You can collect resources from enemies and use it to create new ammos and weapon upgrades as well as med kits which are absolutely vital to playing this game. You can also collect scrap and convert it into usable resources. However, you lose some of the scrap when converting with a smaller loss the more scrap you have. I enjoyed this feature as it encouraged you to save up scrap but in a bind you could use it early.Your starting weapon has clips of ten shots which when they run out you can reload endlessly. It has unlimited ammo. It is not explained but probably the gun uses laser shots or some such thing. It is the weakest gun but acts as a backup weapon or a cheap alternative in the event you are low on ammo for the other guns. I appreciate and fully support this feature of gameplay.Sadly this game falls short in most other areas. Movement is a little awkward and clunky. The Ensign's (Your Character) movement animations end up detracting from the visual beauty of the game. her jump animation is especially bad especially when you slide along the ceiling with your head while jumping when sprinting. Additionally a glitch is possible when sprinting. If you jump while sprinting your sprint gauge fills while in the air at a faster rate than it is depleted by your running allowing you to travel through the ship very fast if you have already cleared the area.The objectives are sometimes unclear or simply don't make any sense. For example, you need to activate some sort of purge and then after have to manually deactivate it. I do not know what the purge was for, nor why it would not deactivate, or even what my deactivating it did. It seemed to have no impact on the gameplay. The further into the game the worse this got. It seemed very much to be unfinished. Explanations were missing or sections just completely skipped over.Transitions between areas were problematic. At first everything worked fine but later in the game there were a couple of awkward transitions that seemed to drop you from the ceiling. I happily ignored those. Then I found some transitions that you could only use in one direction with no clear explanation for why and I suspect is a bug. Finally I eventually realized that going through transistions to new areas reset your character to the last time you saved meaning that if you crafted a type of ammo, didn't save, and passed to a new area, all of that ammo or whatever you made disappeared. Your equipped gun would sometimes also not match what you were using before the transition. This continued to get worse as the game progressed.In some areas of the game specific weapons or ammo are required. For example, a vine like growth blocks a hallway and has to be shot with flame ammo to be burned away. I like this type of thing very much. It acts as an interesting barrier to prevent me from progressing beyond a certain point until I finished the intended content first. The problem, however, is that any time you leave that area the vine grows back and can't be passed without once again shooting it. So if you clear the area beyond it and run out of flame ammo in the process you are stuck unless you can craft more. Of course if you are out of resources and creatures to kill at the same time than you can't craft flame ammo and are permamently stuck unable to progress.Monsters have little variety which I don't mind too much because it is a side scroller and there are plenty of other things to be occupied with. However, there are also very few of some of those limited monster varieties. For example, you fight a fantastic monster called a Samurai at one point. It is accompanied by a stomping sound which fits in nicely with it's size. It acts as a sort of boss fight I suppose. You never see this enemy ever again. The same is true for what can only be called the final boss which is honestly not that difficult of a fight. Some monsters lend themselves well to the idea of a zerg-like swarm but generally you only see 2 or 3 of these enemies together. Some monsters you fight can't be effectively fought without pretty much just taking damage and spamming medkits. It really destroys any semblance of tactical battle for me which is a shame because some of these enemies would work very well for that kind of purpose. The entire game gives you the sense that you will likely be fighting a particularly named creature at some point but you never even see one.The game ends abruptly with an artistic scene of panels in a storyboard fashion, but oddly the art did not quite seem the same as the rest of the game. The ending also added more questions than answers, was not led up to well, and generally left me feeling very unsatisfied.Overall this game was one I want to like and found interesting but simply does not pull it together. It feels like a beta but claims to be finished. Sadly releasing a game in such a fashion usually means I will be avoiding all games from that designer in the future. Such is the case with Dark Matter."

Unfortunatly not long after you start to make your way towards freedom and escape the horrors on the space ship the cracks start to show.Though the visuals do look good with some really nice lighting effects there are some ugly bugs that pop up here and there, and i'm not talking about the purple ones that actually look more cute that terifying , i'm talking the kind where you jump and your character suddenly glitches half way up a few stacked up crates, not to mention falling through elevator floors and down to the bottom of the shaft. Animations also seem to be missing here and there and i don't know what is wrong with my character but she seems to have been roughly cut out of a magazine with blunt scissors.The story is alright, as far as trapped-on-a-alien-infested-spaceship stories go, but there have been numerous times where  i found the ship's AI dialogue to be un-computer-like and even annoying. He quickly begins to sound whiny and needy and you just want him to shut up. Maybe i'm missing some big twist about the AI actually being human or something but i don't think so, i just think it's ""méh'' writing.But when it comes to gameplay and controls that is what finally just made me lose my will to play on and put down my controller  to move on to something else. I will give credit to the idea of when to use the flashlight and when not to use it, but this feature doesn't feel as fleshed out and interesting as it could have been, and that actually goes for the whole game. The controls couldn't have saved it even if they worked properly. They feel slightly awkward and unpolished and even broken at times, to the point where i have to use my mouse to be able to click on a elevator button because my character isn't able to reach it when i use a controller for some reason. Perhaps the game plays better with mouse and keyboard, the options menu and inventory screen certainly seemed to think so, but  i have lost all interest to even care by this point and i have already moved on to enjoy Deadlight, another 2.5D platformer that does most, if not all, things mentioned above right.But if after watching Alien or playing Dead Space you still feel the need on surviving on a hostile spaceship and the new Alien: Isolation is above your budget then by all means, give Dark Matter a go, just be sure to play it with keyboard + mouse and  to get it while it's on sale.There is one other thing, that i can't really complain about for i haven't finished the game,  but i've heard people complain about the game not being finished or just suddenly ending. Now i don't know what the truth about this is but the developer has said that there might be more Dark Matter to come in the future that will continue the story, in other words they are saying it's episodic. That is all fine and dandy but have failed to see that mentioned anywhere on the game's store page. Frankly i think the developer has realized that his product isn't finished and is using the episodic idea as damage control. But hey, that's just what i think, someone who sadly didn't enjoy the game as much as i wanted to and didn't even care enough anymore to finish it. I just hope that the people that did manage to enjoy it get a proper and honest end to this game's story."

It bills itself as a ""survival horror"" which immeadiately sets of a few alarms because I dont like survival horror games. But, if this is a survival horror the sonic is an epic open world rpg.The survival elements are a complete joke I only died twice both time because i got blown up through a door. Theres no survival challenge because you get so much currency i always had atleast 10 medkits on me and enough ammo to throw a texan wedding. Its hard to feel like you're in a desperate situation when you can just crack off a medkit everytime you scrape your knee.Now horror. Websters dictionary defines horror as ""the quality of something that causes feelings of fear, dread, and shock : the horrible or shocking quality or character of something"". And this game does not cause feelings of fear or dread. It doesn't cause dread because there no sense of anticipation because all the monsters walk around so ♥♥♥♥ing loudly you know where they are at all times. And there's no sense of fear because how can you be scared of something when you're packing a ♥♥♥♥ing grenade launcher.It's not all bad though. I do appreciate the fact that monsters dont respawn because it gives a feeling of progression. There is a lot to explore which is nice even though all exploring gets you is currency which can be used to buy a metric crap ton of health and ammo.Now for a couple of nit picks. The footsteps of the protagonist are very loud, which can start to grate a bit. The map is borderline useless. And the shotgun whilst being your most useful weapon is a bit whimpy. And your character when sprinting get tired fast and makes really weird gasping sounds. However, if you jump constantly while sprinting you'll never get tired and you move so fast the game cant keep up.All being said i cant reccomend. This game is horribly boring.

And there's less than ten different enemy types and only four weapon types (the last of which arrives just in time to be used on precisely two occasions before the game unceremoniously ends). And no, it's certainly not going to go down well with the ""this game wasn't hard enough"" and ""this game wasn't long enough"" brigades (which generally consist of exactly the same people, if you hadn't noticed).BUT...(pant pant)...as an attempt to create a highly atmospheric - if not particularly ""scary"" - cross between side-on 2D platforming and old-school ""survival horror"", it's surprisingly successful.

In an age where most popular ""art"" forms seem to have more-or-less run the course of their full potential - movies and music, please stand up! - it's nice to know that video games just might give marauding alien forces a reason to spare us all mass genocide for, oh, at least another twenty years or so.

There are far too many flaws in the game design, as well as flaws in the execution to make this a good game.Pros:Good atmosphere, adequate enemy design. It was fun exploring parts of the ship. The map I feel was done well.Cons:I mentioned metroidvania-esque gameplay but this game is mostly linear. Not much reason to backtrack except for collectables and secrets. Due to the linear level design, whenever there's an enemy that's too strong to be easily killed, you're always forced to just power through it. There's not even a way to avoid enemies; jumping over them just hits an invisible wall and lets them get off a free shot. When you first enounter an armored enemy, you're at the the elevator to the next area and can't get past them, so the computer tells you ""find some better ammo"" but that's in the next section.There are numerous points where you will get killed if you don't know what you're doing, but I wouldn't call them ""puzzles."" They consist of ""don't shine your flashlight on this"" and ""you need to shine your flashlight on this"" and ""uh oh there's a light shining on this thing, there shouldn't be light on this thing, shoot it."" They're not puzzles.Game design issues:- It's repetitive: go through corridor, climb ladder, shoot enemy, rinse, repeat.- Enemies are really stupid -- if they're offscreen they won't attack you.- When the computer's doing a voice over, sometimes there are enemies you're shooting so you can't hear that important piece of dialog, and you can't repeat it either.- Certain points in the game function as enemy farms, so there's basically infinite resources. Why even bother counting resources if they're infinite?Technical issues (could be fixed):- It's really poorly-adapted to controller despite touting ""full controller support."" The UI is next to impossible to navigate with a controller; I knew it was going to be bad news when I was trying to set the options using the controller and I was on a button in the top right of the page, pressed LEFT and then was on a button on the very bottom of the page.  Wouldn't have been so bad except every UI in the game behaves like this. A little bit of controller testing could have prevented this guys.- There are entire map sections where the FPS just took a nose dive. Once I did some exploring in one of these rooms and found an easter egg that was extremely beautifully animated with detailed models. WAT? This shouldn't happen! Obviously the game isn't designed to stop offscreen animations, resulting in poor overall performance.- Killing tentacles on the ceiling results in the loot spawning above the ceiling, which can't be collected.- Killing tentacles in the scene background results in loot spawning in the background plane, which can't be collected.The verdict: This game is an unfinished mess."

It reminds me of Epics Shadow Complex. Love this style! No matter the infulential negitivity of the masses I believe there is a fan base for this genre of 2D gaming. Keep it coming Interwave!

Some clever use of light activated puzzles and enemies fits the ambience of the atmosphere. However, the game lacks real polish and ends up feeling hastily put together, with less of a true castlevania dynamic and more of a combative hallways feel. Good try, poor execution.Still, worth a shot."

I bought this game on sale sometime back in spite of the mixed reviews and must say that it was really not bad at all. I generally don't play side scrollers but the game was fun and had some great environments, crafting, and upgradeable weapons. It was obviously meant to be a bigger game and ended too soon. I would really have liked to have seen more of the ship. That to me is the only real negative about this game. It could have been more. I did not run into any of the bugs mentioned but did at times get a little stuck on what I was supposed to be doing or going. I just read the discussion pages and watched some YouTube videos and they helped just fine. Overall worth the experience, especially if you buy it on sale. I think I paid around $2.00. I have paid more for some crappy ""AAA"" games that I did not even put 12 hours into, so I can't complain."

The story is very thin, but enjoyable, it let you feel a myster that you cant solve. Nice the artificial intelligence that guide you, it seems human and not human at the same time, well script! The light play a huge part on the game, attracting enemies and activating/deactivating enemies traps.

Maybe this is a designer clear decision, but I would love to see my Ensign (her name... sigh) play a little with the AI. nope... not a word!

Ensign just stay blocked while doing such actions, a little atmosphere killer!- The comands... I played with a xbox controller... must time all ok, but the menus are a pain in the ""you now what"" to navigate and often Ensign stopped to move with no apparent reason, leaving me ready to be killed by the monsters! A little more work on the movements would have been appreciated!!!!!- The bugs. Nothing that can ruin your game, but often it happen that more than a trigger are put in the same place, so if you want to open a door you have to move a little around becouse first it says ""no power"" than, a pass or two on the right, it says open... painful if you dont know this! other minor bugs around (like triggers than shows off but that must be invisible) but again nothing awful.- This game is well done, but if you search for perfection... not a game for you. it seems like... well, a indie game (and it is). a little more work here and there to clean some roughness and it would be perfect!final verdict 7.5/10Sorry for my english, Italy here!!!!"

The control scheme, at least with an XB360 controller, take some fiddling to get just right.  It's very atmospheric (OK, not Alien: Isolation atmospheric, but for a budget indie game it does a pretty good job).The story is interesting enough, at least enough to keep me searching for messages that other survivors have left behind.  No spoilers, but the intro video (which is one of the trailers IIRC) spells out an encounter with an unknown object which kills most of the crew, and then a parasitic/carnivorous infestation that basically wipes almost everyone onboard out.The protagonist, a nameless Ensign, is a forgettable character that gets the job done.  The voice acting is serviceable, with cringe-worthy moments.  My wife says she walks like a dude...Combat is simple to the point of being almost meaningless, at least in the ~1 hour I've invested so far.  Maybe it'll improve as I progress.  I *hope* it improves.I did encounter a few glitches while playing.  One that sticks in my mind is that elevator buttons didn't work unless I jumped and hit the Interact key on the way down from the jump...

I liked most of the game, and I don't mind the movement or the move-and-shoot-stuff others mentioned. I mean, you're not a marine, you're some random crew member just woken from cryosleep crawling through a ship infested with aliens, who, after such a long time, don't expect any attack. So to me there's no reason why you shouldn't succeed where the marines failed, even though you're not a trained fighter.And I don't mind reading a little. It adds to the feeling of a) the game being retro and b) nobody being there on the ship.Some minor bugs annoyed me like the go-here-markers on the minimap didn't always work which ended in me crawling through the level to find where I'm supposed to be. But that's just a minor thing. On the other hand, I like the way the game works with light and the overall feeling this creates.Despite of the following issues, I recommend the game. It's nice to play and I totally liked the atmosphere.What really bugs me is that you get the feeling that this game should have been longer.* Medium Spoiler Alert *Not in comparison to the price, but there is nothing indicating the ending. You literally open a door and there it is. And you have just gotten the last piece of equipment and have used it once to clear an obstacle. I can't shake the feeling that there was like 15 more minutes of gameplay planned but then the budget ran out and they put the ending behind some more or less random door.* Major Spoiler Alert *Oh, and the ending explains too much. Seriously, I could have lived with not knowing what the Angels were. What I gathered so far was enough: Weirdly powerful aliens, the real threat. Or have the info seeded into the game proper.I always try to fix things so here is my try on this: Just imagine your mentoring voice telling you 2-3 times to meet him in the Toxic Materials section and how he longs to meet you in person. And that he's got a way to escape from the ship. This way there would be a build-up to this point. You could even have a little twist like him not indicating he's a sort of AI, but saying ""I dug in here and have a means to escape, but I can't do it alone."" Of course people would wonder, like why someone is still alive. But that's not a bad thing. Having a feeling that things just don't add up. And then the ending would come as a relief.

The A.I. narrator kind of helped a little but not nearly enough.Models are a little dated but game looked fairly atmospheric with decent backgrounds. Control scheme was okay, not perfect but worked okay for the title. Foes jump in small corridors and no place left to backtrack meaning it all boils down to bringing craftables to bench for medpaks.

Tend to die allot but that is because I'm stupid, not the game.The controls are a little bit clunky and I'm having a hard time getting use to the aiming since it all get down to on what side of the character the mouse pointer is at times. Slightly awkward for me but I can't see any other way they could have solved it and with a little practice.Overall a nice game that I can recommend!"

,Not Recommended,251410,31129043,Posted: 13 April,all,Live Love Play,"Dark Matter Has a promising structure, solid mechanics, and an interesting narrative but its incomplete nature prevents it from being as good as it could be. Published by Iceberg Interactive in October 2013 and developed by InterWave Studios, Dark Matter is billeted as a survival-horror-sidescroller in Metroidvania style. The player takes the role of “The Ensign”, the mute last survivor of the spaceship Endeavor. Guided by the voice of the mysterious AI “Companion” she must scavenge and fight her way off of the ship to survive.For my full review please follow the link belowhttp://www.iliveloveplay.com/dark-matter-game-review/"

However, there's not much more beyond that....but where it falls flat is the environments: Technically they look different, but somehow they all look the same. Without any variation, the game just ends up becoming one big maze. This means that you can easily take a wrong turn and end up missing the shotgun in the game, so you find yourself asking yourself why you need to glitch-kill enemies from off-screen in order to proceed.There's also a good amount of various bugs. It's nothing show-stopping, although you are sighing from relief when you're done evading them all. This game sure could have benefited from a few play testers.I bought this game on sale, and I'm glad that I did. I don't hate this game, but I barely enjoyed it."

However, the game suffers from a limited gameplay, lack of clear progression, a half baked crafting system that looks as if it is an abandoned feature left in the game.The story isn't finished and the ending is missing. Completely looks as if they decided half way to just let the game end without finishing it.  A shame for its potential, but it should not have been released in this state."

Some nice atmosphere but it wears off quick, same with any story here, its a polished half a game. or rush job, or case of premature release. Also contains some minor through n through Tentacle X Corps, necrophilia. Don't believe me DB link down there at the end. Save your time and money I lost almost 12 hours. Feels more like a Late Alpha or RC Press copy than full content. Sorry Devs hope you enjoy your cash grab party.I ran into a number of bugs haha hooo *knee slaps*, but really some unclear clipping planes and odd interactions. Then there is the quest breaking thing, Apparently i don't really need to disable the fire system and just get bored and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥till I went  out to committed a bit of bug regicide. Was cool to find out if you sprint, jump and hit a door panel all at the right time it crushes you! :D good laugh then more wandering about hopelessly. After you figure out the  one layer of mechanics thats it, they never evolve or  differ much. Seceret areas at first i hope for some metroid like levels, NOPE. I found like half dozen 'hidden' areas. but some stay off map so its hard to figure out but not worth it. Don't even get concerned over bullets or parts to look to hard. OH the Ememy AI is cheats, the seekers teleport off screen to be infront of you, right behind you or hell up or down a level magically!! BUt you really only see ...6 or so really dangerous enemies the whole game. a few Seekers=cheat, some mini boss ♥♥♥♥♥, the 'queen' who had the worst AI and looks like a tic and the doors if you get caught in one, maybe the map too when it breaks.Spoiler.After the un impressive 'queen battle' where i stood un moving on a platform edge firing the now grenade launcher and a pistol of never needs bullets, that you can use for like 80% of the game NP. I walked off int the sunset with my new pointless grenade launcher. Pointless, but whGAME OVER!Big spoilers! Below.The end is weak, you dont even get to walk to the games end, click door then roll lame end movie :/  30 so odd years for this great destructive force of 'the angels' and you never see one, hear one, or  the victims they made so many of, burnt into ash in-front of view screens. Or the horror that drove capital ship running A.I.s go mad and commit mass digital suicide pact, Why I don't buy Japanese electronics. And where is the bad♥♥♥♥♥game you teased me with at the end :/ ? Going around the universe as a demi god AI/human blend dealing out wrath and salvation, lol. That was the name of the untouched after 30 years shuttle they escaped on.I don't but it and neither should you.What, did you need, oh, you don't wan, you sure.. well I can't get in trouble for a screen cap.. can I? well your riskStill there ok fine.https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30729799/Well%20then.jpgHope you are happy with yourself."

76561197965046644,Not Recommended,251410,35091391,Posted: 20 September,all,DarkSnakeSoul,"A interesting concept and story but sadly has a bunch of issues especially the ending.==The Good==1. Graphics - I felt the graphics were good for this game as it helped sell the immersion of the game. I had many times stopped and looked at the backdrops, seeing what little details are back there.==The Bad==1. Ending - Sadly the first ending was just a text. The new ending is a bit better but still doesn't feel satisfying especially with what you went through.2. Short - It felt short to me, even after looking for everything and exploring everywhere I felt overall it was a very short experience and was hoping for more but sadly never got any.3. Bugs - I found my share of bugs such as doors glitching, getting stuck in walls, dieing randomly and glitching through the map. Again these are random so just be careful where your going or what your doing.==Overall==It's a hit and miss. I do love the concept they were pushing for but the execution felt very lacking and felt a bit rushed. I would recommend buying very cheap or passing."
