,Recommended,251430,7362356,"Posted: 11 October, 2013",all,noibn,"As modern point and click adventure games go, this one is fairly decent. It's not a mind-blowing experience by any means, but it's definitely not bad either. You play as a guy named Robert who finds himself thrust into a quest to save the world (naturally). Robert is a very naive and unassuming sort of fella, so a lot of the plot and humor centers around his clueless innocence. The story and dialogue is fairly good for the most part, in turns charming, funny and dark. The voice acting is hit or miss, though - mostly it is decent, but a few lines here and there are inexplicably bad (wrong pronunciations, improper emphasis of words, etc). Mechanically, the game also has its ups and downs. Being a point and click game, you would think that the pointing and clicking would be spot-on, but that's not always the case. Sometimes you can't click on things that you should be able to click (though it usually fixes itself in a second or two). Additionally, half of the achievements don't seem to be working properly. However, the developers have started to release patches to fix some of these problems, so a lot of these things may not be issues in the future. Regardless, none of these faults are deal breakers by any means, anyways.The puzzles are fairly standard in adventure game terms. You basically just go around talking to people, picking up objects, and using those objects (or combinations thereof) to solve puzzles and progress further. Thankfully, none of the solutions are overly ridiculous or unintuitive (as is the case with many adventure games), though you will need to really think some stuff through from time to time. Apparently there is also a help system in place if you need it (which I didn't even realize until after finishing the game), so you probably won't ever get stuck for long, if you even get stuck at all. The game is divided into 5 chapters, each of which consists of a self-contained series of puzzles that take place on 3 or 4 ""screens"". Playtime is probably around 7-8 hours or so, give or take. So keep that in mind in terms of how much you are willing to pay. All in all, the game is pretty good. As I said earlier, it is nothing mind-blowing for the genre, but it's a nice experience while it lasts. Probably the worst thing I could say about it (aside from the minor glitches noted above) is that the pacing is very slow. The dialogue in particular seems like it takes foreeeeeeeever sometimes, especially with a main character who is so low-key and slow. The pace may test your patience at times. But if you don't mind that and are into classic adventure games, this is probably worth a look at some point. I would probably recommend waiting for a sale, though, unless you are hardcore into adventure games and need something new to play now."

The hand-crafted backgrounds of the world really give the whole game a great personality (even if the character art was a bit too simple for the beautiful scenery). The storyline is creative and engaging enough that I couldn't stop playing and made it through the game in about 8-9 hours over three days. Currently playing through it for the achievements and making sure I find all the clever jokes buried inside.8.5/10, am playing again."

Voice Acting is great and generally Sound is good. Writing is interesting and the dialogue is delightfully ""oddball"".Keep in mind the bizarre nature of the puzzles will require equally bizarre solutions. ""Pixel hunt"" & ""Item Clutter"" is never really an issue (hold Spacebar for hotspots). So yeah, you can brute force your way through quite a bit. The hint system is good because it will give you clues (more specific each subsequent time when used on the same puzzle), and doesn't just hand out answers.This is a quality game at a reasonable price.

Now onto the inner world and i found this game so much more enjoyable than the deponia series. I also preferred this game over broken age. Eventhough broken age has better graphics and illusration but I was more captivated in this game than broken age. I guess its cause broken age has more of a serious tone? Inner world was funnier and quirkier, therefore i never found any part of the game boring.The storyline is good, i enjoyed clicking on all the speech bubbles to hear more about the story. Puzzles were logical and understandable not weird and random (unlike some other puzzle games where u randomly just put things together hoping it'll work) Illustration is simple yet attractive, alot of different scenes. The game lasted quite long hence i felt like it was value for money. Overall, if u like funny, cute adventure games with a cute storyline (and cute characters! e.g. gorf & tumblemouse!) then try out this game! i rly enjoyed it!!"

This game is actually good and the main character is not an annoying little turd.Fantastic voicework and dialogue. Flutenose had me cracking up through the entire game with his innocent yet unsettling commentary.  Loved the artwork. Cute and unique. Puzzles were difficult but not so difficult I could not figure them out on my own (or at least randomly click my way there). Great story. The mythos is unique and I'd love further instalments delving into this. Good characters. I LOVE FLUTENOSE. He's such an adorable little psycho. Laura could be grating, especially when she wouldn't help out with puzzles.My only negatives (besides Laura) was that the game was occasionally buggy (not gamebreaking, though) and there could've been a longer ending (ending is a bit abrupt).This is the type of game where you'd want a sequel, but you don't know how it could compare to the first. 9/10"
,Recommended,251430,17215561,"Posted: 24 July, 2015",all,Astrobia,"Played through twice. Once to complete and once again to get the achievements I'd missed. Second playthrough took about an hour and a half with me skipping all dialogue and cutscenes, the rest of the time was spent going through puzzles and watching loading screens. Actually that made me notice a lot of the puzzles had a lot of wandering back and forth between locations but that's a minor criticism. Otherwise the short playtime is to be expected when you already know the solutions to all the puzzles, so it shows there is a decent amount of content there. I'd estimate 6 to 10 hours depending on how quick you are on the uptake.First playthrough I completed with know guides or help from the hint system. I did scratch my head occasionally but it's not an exceptionally hard point and click adventure. The majority of the puzzles make logical sense and most the time you know what you want to do and the challenge is more in finding the right items to do it. If you are stuck it usually means you need to go back and talk to someone now you know more or you just missed and item in another area. Holding down the left mouse button shows all the hot spots for objects you can interact with on the screen so thankfully pixel hunting is not a barrier like the old days of P&C. If you do get stuck there's an in game help system that tells you what your goals are and can get successively more detailed hints on what to do next from, so you still wont need a guide to help you complete it.The art style is styalised as you can see from the screenshots above. Appeal comes down to personal opinion. The quality of the art assets is adequate for what they are trying to convey. I didn't find myself not knowing what something was when I looked at it.Sound wise the voice acting is decent enough, soundFX are adequate to indicate what they are and the music sets the mood without been noteworthy enough to get in the way of your attention. In otherwords it all serves it's purpose.The story is well written and very original. There's a decent amount of lore to give depth to this unique universe and it is delivered with good pacing to keep the mysteries unfolding all the way to the end. Characters are well designed, you like and contempt them as appropriate and as such feel satisfied when they get what they deserve (good or bad). Dialogue is amusing whenever it's not supposed moving. I would say it's laugh out loud funny but I went through most the game with a bemused smile.The emotional drama isn't exactly gripping, in spite of it's content it doesn't feel super dark and gripping or a tear jerker like some other games in the genre (try some deadalic titles like chains of satinav of whispered world for that). It's interesting, it walks a tight right where you do feel sympathy for the characters without been devastated by the tragedy constantly befalling them. In other worlds it's pretty light hearted if still a little grim at times.Loading times aside (they are short but still noticeable enough to annoy you when you realise you have to backtrack because you forgot something) my biggest criticism would have to be stability. Very occasionally the cut scene animations didn't play correctly when completing a puzzle (no impact on gameplay you just miss out on the visual) and the game would periodically crash, I'd say you can expect it to do so 3-5 times between the begging of the game and completion. Thankfully the game autosaves after literally everything you do so you never lose any progress. Another example of how it's not super polish but enough work was put in to make sure things are good enough to preform to resonable expectations.In summary this is a solid addition to the genre and at the end of the day the game left me hoping for a sequel to be released in the future, which in my book is as solid a recommendation as any."

It was lighthearted and funny despite the dark undertones present throughout the entire story. The art style contributed to those charcteristics perfectly. I love point and click adventure games already and this one made it to my favorites list for sure. As far as the gameplay goes... the more you click the more you know... I feel like there was unending dialogue for everything you clicked on. So the more you want to know about the story just keep clicking. They really put a lot of effort into the charcters. As far as solving the different scenarios you come across the developers added a useful hint section within the game to help you if you get stuck. Enjoy!

,Recommended,251430,25991383,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,ElusiveOne,"The Inner Worldoffers an elegantly simple adventure set in a pleasantly peculiar little world. Its immediately charming ambiance and art style lend a unique tone to the reasonably enjoyable story, where every detail is nicely executed but falls short of impressing.Your character, Robert, is strangely charming in his naive and very literal approach to everything. He does not understand metaphors and is relatively dimwitted with a knack for stating the obvious. Your eventual partner has a far more confrontational and action-driven persona. Most characters you'll meet are actually quite original and rather silly.Decent writing and delightful vocal performances, with strangely slow-paced and very articulated dialogue, make the game actually sort of relaxing to hear. Coupled with the reassuring absence of failure, it is quite pleasant if somewhat unexciting.The game behaves as you'd expect in a point-and-click, with an overall high level of polish, except in a few scenes where the audio sometimes cut abruptly at inappropriate times. Nice, clean interface, particularly with good iconography used for all dialog choices. Technically very stable.""That's just a random guess, isn't it?""Puzzle requirements and solutions unfold naturally, except in the final chapter, which I found a bit more obtuse than the rest. Situations are all a bit absurd but nearly always made sense within the given context. My interest nevertheless progressively dwindled once the novelty wore off and the plot turned into a more conventional cliché.Funny achievements reward failed creative attempts or silly solutions. One of the better uses of achievements I've seen in any type of game, they complement the humour nicely.Serviceable but unremarkable cutscenes are directly layered over the background panels for a nice, dynamic integration. The hand-drawn animation has style but the frame rate is not very smooth. Also, English signs do not match spoken dialogue and remain in German during cutscenes, but that's just nitpicking.If this game were a meal, it'd be the sort that fills you up sufficiently to satisfy the hunger but would not cut the craving for truly delicious food. There's really nothing to dislike about The Inner World. It's a fun, simple game in the tradition of the genre, built on solid foundations that will hopefully spawn a better sequel."

While it is polished enough to be worth your time, it hasn't enough charm or substance in the storytelling to keep you engrossed.A first stab at the adventure genre by the developers, they've told a story of a little boy who is a member of an underground civilization plagued by a number of problems, first are all these wind gods turning people into stone and the second being the absence of wind.  The world is foreign and interesting enough with its own history, culture, and physics that keep you guessing and interested in what is happening and what led up to the present sequence of events.  The story is, boy gets caught up in problem, meets anarchist girl, ends up in revolution, discovers past, bad stuff happens, uses past to save the world, live happily ever after.  The story is adventure game fodder and is not done exceptional enough to make it seem new or like something I haven't played already.The dialogue was translated from German and it was done well enough save for some patchy words which made it into the localization, misnamed objects, odd sentences and the like.  As far as that goes, there is a LOT of dialogue.  Your mileage may vary if you consider this a good or bad thing.  It provides a lot of exposition, character development, and world building.  It also starts falling into the land of monotonous walls of text.  If you are having any issues with a dialogue puzzle, you can expect to see the same lines repeated several times.The art is done to give the game its own style.  It's cartoony, imaginative, and contributes to the development of the story and world.  The only issue I had with it was it had so much drab and brown, but that's for my own tastes.The puzzles, dialogue and inventory, are done well and help the pacing, which is all I can ask of puzzles in an adventure game.  They are well-made and don't require the use of LOL logic to figure out.  Their difficulty improves gradually over the game and helps immersion and pacing.  If you have problems, the game has an interactive hint book which can help push you in the right direction.  There's nothing really bad I can say about them other than the repetition you may face if you have issues with a dialogue puzzle.In all, the game is ok and I had no real problems with it.  The only problem is, it exists in a genre swamped with better games and other games no better than this one.  If you are an adventure game fan, you can play this for something new.  Otherwise, look for something else."

It's vastly amusing, simple yet thoughtful, charming in its graphics and character voicing, and most importantly to me, the puzzles are LOGICAL. After playing Deponia, which was challenging even with a detailed walkthrough, the logical thought pattern of ""well, this doesn't hit the bad guy in the jaw like I was hoping, but it is going under his nose, and I happen to have knockout drops, therefore when it passes underneath he will fall unconscious onto the button"" is very refreshing. it's nice to be able to figure out some problems on my own before turning to the in-game hints. Those hints, by the way, are super nice because they'll not only give you pointers to the logical procession of seemingly unconnected tasks, but the hints are arranged in a way that you can click through a couple, just enough to get the idea without it expressly telling you, without feeling like you've totally given up on all problem solving on your own.Robert is a very sweet likeable character, though Laura was a bit of a drag at times. The plot was engaging, and had a few unexpected twists. Very rarely do I get engrossed enough in a game to feel worried or horrified for the characters, but this one sucked me in and I was genuinely rooting for Robert and Laura long before the end.That being said, I would also recommend this game solely because of the hilarious progression of the Conrad puppet.A must-have game for those who like a casual point-and-click.

It has charming, wacky characters and suitably bizarre little environment built to showcase the story and gameplay. The puzzles are fairly simple and fun to solve and it has it's own built in hinting system, which truth be told I took advantage of more than once, but got an achievement for it. :D The humor is sweet and innocent, but funny nonetheless. Voice acting is great and most, with the exception of Laura and a few others, are spoken with British accenting in the English version. There were some minor glitches and one or two crashes, but overall the game seems pretty stable. I would recommend it for those that like the genre and I think it would be a fun one to play with the kids or just let them loose on it themselves.My rating:  8/10  :)"

Then find the time/money to get this game, period.The Inner World combines a beautiful and intriguing graphical style with some wonderfully off the wall design, such as a world built on the inside of a sphere, not the outside like ours. This is all backed with a melodic and inquisitive musical score that binds it all together (I could happily listen to the opening menu music for quite some time). The human-like inhabitants all have stripey arms, legs and nose, apart from the main character Robert, who seems different from everyone else with his flute nose.The adventure starts with Robert going on a quick errand to rescue a necklace stolen by a pesky pigeon but he quickly finds himself being sucked into an adventure to discover the many secrets of the Inner World; which is a lot as he's never left the castle before!Through his journey you meet a wealth of very original characters and combined with the delightfully naive Robert lead to some great writing with a nice dry sense of humour. The voice acting and translation in itself is superb considering that the game was written in German and any slip ups are almost unnoticeable.The mandatory puzzles are also top class, encouraging you to explore and use that point-n-click crazy logic to allow you to progress. Many of these give Robert and the other characters a great opportunity to make you smile, particularly Laura the female lead. There is also a robust hint system for those that find this kind of game a bit too much of a challenge so you never feel held back from enjoying the story.Completed this in 7 or 8 hours or so but enjoyed every second. A wonderful world with great characters to fall in love with."

The main character leaves his home as the naive protagonist and must work his way up to becoming the hero, along with the help of his friend Laura and her pet pigeon.This is one of those adventure games where it's got a few cute, unique elements, but also it's more like a comic book you can play through. The puzzles are set up in a usual adventure game style, where you have to find and combine some items to make them work.I'll warn you that it's a bit dialog heavy. You have to talk to a lot of characters, so if you're not in the mood to sit through quite a bit of worldbuilding-through-chatting, I'd wait to play this game until you feel more patient.It's not a revolutionary game, but it is fun. I'm happy to have it in my library. The only bad thing is there was one, single puzzle that was impossible for me to solve, because I had already tried that combination of things, but not at the right exact time. Regular adventure game frustrations, you know? It could really have been fixed, I think, but it doesn't ruin the entire game. The thing is, once you talk to someone and they give you all the information they can, or they have said all there is to say in a conversation, that button gets grayed out. You can click it again, but throughout the entire game the character would just repeat the same thing over if you did so. That caused a problem with one of the puzzles.Other than that minor issue, I enjoyed playing this, I found the characters cute (if not a little cliche), and it had some lovely art and a nice world."

With plenty of puzzles, voice-acting, and interactions, Studio Fizbin may have a hit on their hands. The game has an innovative hint system and deals with some fairly mature themes for the genre.

Music was good, and the gameplay was as it should be for a point and click. Puzzles usually were fairly easy, to some tougher, complex puzzles. However, these puzzles were never solved with out of this world solutions, like a toothpaste and a comb made a lockpick. However, in an almost first puzzle, the game would take the idea of drowning/flushing a worm out of its hole, and decide to make you use alcohol, and as such the worm is out because it is drunk.The story was pretty predictable from the beginning, but was funny throughout. There are some mature/suggestive themes laced in a pretty tame and overall child friendly game.I should point out two issues I had though. One was that the game about 3-4 times would get stuck while loading after a cutscene. In these cases I had to restart the game, but the pretty constant autosaving made this less of an issue. The other issue is deals with a hint system. The game supposively has one, yet I couldn't find how to use it, and as such had to at times look at a walkthrough on Youtube to solve some mildly complex puzzles. And for most people this may not be an issue, but achievement hunters may get irritated when trying to get the achievement that wants you to use the hint system."

Game itself was quite suitable for an impatient person like me (the story moved forward quite fast), and the puzzles weren't too hard, tricky but not THAT hard. I would definately recommend this game for casual gamers."

The story, while not overly deep, is interesting and certainly charming with a bit of dark humor thrown in.The puzzles were often challenging, using that special brand of logic reserved for point & click adventure games. Luckily, there's a fantastic hint system that can very subtly nudge you in the right direction.The voice acting, graphics, and characters were all wonderful in every possible way. It's obvious a lot of care went into this game. Would definitely recommend."
