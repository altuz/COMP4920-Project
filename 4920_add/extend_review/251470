One of the main reasons I could not recommend this game at all on release was that, as far as I knew, it was not possible to unlock all single-player content without multiplayer modes (versus), which requires an extra controller.  As this is NOT the case, I can recommend this game if it is on sale (50% off or more, and it has been 75% off previously) and you look up the code.  If it matters, you will still need to fufill normal unlock conditions for achievements.The game still sorely needs an online mode, has no AI for versus, and is not quite a pick-up and play title.  The two times I've returned to this game after a long absence, it has taken me a while to relearn the controls, an issue I don't frequently have with other games.  This may not be a problem if you play often enough, or with a controller.My outdated review can be seen below---------------------------------------------------------------------------If you can gather 1 to 3 people for local multiplayer, then feel free to buy this game.However, if you plan to play this game by yourself, make sure you have a spare controller before purchasing this game.Why?  Because even with a keyboard, a controller is required to play Versus mode, and certain content (at least 3 map sets and all 4 extra characters) can not be unlocked unless you can access Versus mode.If you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all single player content.If you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all the content in a game you paid for.I would change my stance on this game in the future if either:1)  The ability for a single player to fight against the AI in ""versus mode""  is addedor2) An online mulitplater mode is addedThe second option may be a little unreasonable, but the first isn't.Either of these would allow players to play versus mode without a controller, thus giving them the ability to unlock game content that is currently unaccessible with just a keyboard."
,Recommended,251470,18812882,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,Space Admiral Laika,"Note: This game can only be played locally. There is no online multiplayer whatsoever.Spectacular battle arena-type game focused on fast-paced bow and arrow oriented combat, with mechanics that are very approachable and, for the most part, easy to figure out on your own. The relative transparency of its mechanics does not, however, mean that it is an easy game to master, with its tight controls, twitch counterplay mechanics, and well-crafted, deceptive arenas. A notable feature is the added dimension of screen wrapping - players or objects that pass through the bottom of the screen will come out through the top, left side through the right, and vice versa. Should you decide to pick the game up, you will soon discover what a devilish thing this can be.The game is split into three modes: Versus, Co-op, and Trials. The Versus mode pits 2-4 players against one another in one of three different sub-modes, all focused on killing the opposing players, with a large number of game modifiers available that change the games in a variety of ways. There are a large number of stages available, some of which have to be unlocked through various means. Co-op mode (perhaps more aptly called ""Quest mode"", as it can be played and enjoyed perfectly well as a solo experience) is a mode that pits you and a friend (up to three friends in the expansion's version of co-op) against waves of different enemies on each of the themed maps. There's not much more to it than that, but it is enjoyable and provides for some challenge if you're going for achievements. Lastly, Trials is a time trial mode that challenges you to destroy a number of dummies as quickly as possible with the tools available in each stage. It's somewhat maddening, but engrossing for the obsessive.Overall there is little about the game that I can fault. The most notable flaw is its lack of online multiplayer, the exclusion of which may well have been intentional, as the game appears to have been constructed to strongly encourage getting together and duking it out with a group of friends. Even so, I would recommend it as a singleplayer game due to its inherent charm and the challenges it provides in its Quest and Trial modes, although I imagine a lot of people would disagree with me on this point. I'm just a sucker for a good challenge wrapped into a neat little package. I expect I will be returning to this game many times in the future."
,Recommended,251470,17731162,"Posted: 26 August, 2015",all,Tom,"TowerFall Ascension is an arena type game. This game was released in March 2014, after initially being released as an Ouya exclusive in 2013 (snarf). It is now on PC, PS4 and Mac/Linux.TowerFall's arena type gameplay focuses heavily on archery. The game has two modes; firstly the single player - the aim is to kill targets around each stage either by stomping on their heads, or by shooting them with your bow before a timer runs out; this leaves to plenty of replaying of levels in order to better your score and to beat your best time.Where TowerFall really shines is in the multiplayer mode. Up to four players will fight in a battle royal environment. Your aim is simple, kill or be killed. Each player has a limited amount of arrows to do it in too, so you can't just spam fire and hope you get lucky. You are able to replenish your ammo by picking up rogue arrows shot by yourself and the others though, meaning things can get very frantic. Throughout the stage, there will also be various different power-ups spawn, such as special effects on your arrows or shields - these all add to the extremely fast paced gameplay.The graphics and art style, yet again have the pixelated theme, but they are still all really well drawn out and it looks very pleasant. Each of the arenas that you are fighting in also look amazing too, some will be set in the jungle, others in a poorly lit cave, they all look gorgeous.Single player in TowerFall Ascension is easy; you can easily clear the stages in less than an hour. Where the difficulty ramps up like most games is the multiplayer. It will only be as difficult as your opponents are, as they are they only thing that can kill you; you don't need to worry about the environment playing tricks against you.  It will take you a few hours to get to a point where you are competent in games; it can be very frustrating though.I have been playing TowerFall for almost eight hours now; I would say that this is a game to play in small chunks. Bring it out when you have friends over for an hour of almost archery style Super Smash Bro fun, but any more than that, and you may find yourself getting a little bored.  This is certainly a game to keep installed due to the replay-ability though.The game supports resolutions up to 1080P, which I suppose is all you need for a pixel style game like this and it is highly recommended you play this game with a game pad; keyboard controls would be a nightmare.To conclude, I am going to simply recommend TowerFall Ascension; its a game that not everyone will enjoy, and is almost certainly made with couch multiplayer in mind. If you don't have friends who also own this game, don't get it, the single player is not worth it. If you can find a group to play with, sure its worth the £10,99 because of the fun fast paced gameplay you'll get out of it.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's that good, it's a masterpiece.2/ There are long time technical issues that are not fixed.There is no network mode.The default bindings of the pad and the keyboard are not really good and worse, you cant rebind them ingame.The game recognizes only xbox pads (which are not very good for the price)3/ the solo and coop game are terrible.It seems those modes have been put on top of the real game afterwards, as they are not properly designed. The levels are full of choke points, and the only challenge the game can throw at the player is overwhelming him with more entities, not clever enemy design, not clever mapping.Solo mode is a grinding chore.Timings are not properly tweaked, making use of the movement combos awkward and combined with the bindings the game isnt a fast flowing movement and fighting game anymore but an exercise in memory where you try to find the perfect way to beat every level by doing the same thing again and again.And even that is defeated by the game choice to enter a little bit of randomness in the entities start position, which changes nothing but just add to the time you need to pass to know every pattern.I understand that this game is a one man operation and came from an other platform. This could explain some of the technical difficulties or some bad design choice. As I said it is still one of the best game ever in local multi.But those issues have been tackled to death by other games for a long time and they are resolved by other one-man games. Take a look at spelunky. Wether you like it or not, the timings of the entities, the reaction of the pad, everything is 100% precise and you can rebind controls.The game could have somehow worked in solo mode too and warrant a recommandation if some of those issues had been taken care of.In 2015, even if your game is an indie game with a retro look, we can't accept this kind of backward usability issues."

The controls are excellent.Only a few buttons, yet there issooo much differencebetween being skilled at it, which requires a fairly complete understanding of the system, and being ‘meh’. It seems simple at the start, where you are clunkily platforming around the levels (at the time you think its just fine), until you start learning how to 'dodge-cancel' and soon enough you will be flying around in a way you would have previously thought impossible.2. All the action takes place on a single screen.This allows for purely awesome couch co-op or versus.TowerFallrevels in how simple itfeels, but yet has many layers of complexity that it rolls back as you dig in.3. The action is fast and furious.It doesn’t get any better than this, as far as couch co-op or versus goes.I even had friends playing this that would never touch a platformer.I mean it was complex enough for a serious gamer, yet could draw in newbs. Tons of mode customization as well, and lots of cool trophy unlocks (tons actually) and statistics that keep me coming back for more.Caveat:the only  deal-breaker for this game, is that you must have controllers, and you must have friends willing to come over and sit on the couch to play local. If you don’t have this, go elsewhere. Single player is really fun since I look at it as training, but other than that, I would not recommend just for single player experience.I could go on and on, but at the end of the day – I am hooked.I think my friends may be hooked as well. At this point, it’s my favorite game at the moment, and I plan to get many hours out of it (I even set up a competition and invited 8-10 people over in early June 2015)."

Going to try for no death runs next.I love everything about it. I've mostly only played solo but I'm glad there's 4 player co-op now. My only request would be that the two campains are merged allowing for 4 player in the Ascension Quest. The problem would be unifying the difficulty system and reseting everyones achievements so I can see why it wasn't done, I still think it would be a nice addition.I don't miss the scoring system. All the stages have an achievement for clearing the highest difficulty with no deaths, this being the highest achievement pretty much made the scoring superfluous. Additionally the game now tracks fastest times which I think is a much more easily understood and meaningful measure of skill. Speed runners rejoice! The Dark World campaign isn't overly long and be cleared on the easier difficulty in around an hour, but those who enjoyed playing for gold skulls in the Ascension Quest will get a lot out of playing for the harder achievements.Prism arrows I think are designed to affect high level competitive play, where no one misses a dodge catch, in which case it makes a significant change to the meta game. Trigger arrows are fun but damn is it easy to SD with. There is such a huge number of arrow varieties now that adding more might start to subtract from what makes each arrow interesting, as well as increasing the barrier of entry for newcomers. Haven't had a chance to play much versus yet but the Dark World content should make a great addition.Also love the additional Trials stages. It's a part of the game I didn't expect myself to take so much pleasure in, but once you start aiming for the red pearl dev times the mode becomes a kind of rewarding puzzle game, though it does play havoc on my RSI and I fear my controller will crumble in my hands before I ever clear them all.All in all I love every bit of TowerFall and can't wait to see what Matt works on next, TowerFall or otherwise."

There really aren't many alternatives when it comes to Steam party games. I suppose if you're someone with a Steambox who is just realizing Half Life 2 and Sakura Spirits do not make for very good party games, it may be worth the investment. Otherwise, just bust out the Gamecube.  Play some smash bros.I'm not saying the game isn't a unique experience. The archery is fun, but it has its problems.  In Co-Op/Singleplayer you can only shoot in 8 directions, and your arrows will curve slightly towards any enemy. On a couple occasions I was trying to shoot something directly above me. So I shot up, but the arrow curved  towards a closer enemy who was above and to the left. It missed him then tried to curve and hit my original target. Ended up missing both stationary enemies.Playing alone is not very fun. Thats alright, most party games aren't meant to be played solo. A lack of Online really sucks. Some website named Polygon even wrote an article on why you don't want Online in this game. Which was all I saw when googling if there would ever be online. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the dev told them to write that so Steam reviews would stop complaining about it. An easy fix would be to add a LAN mode.  Normal people are forced to play the way the dev intended it.  But those who live out in the middle of nowhere can still use Hamachi to play with a friend.There was also going to be a map editor but the $10 dlc was of greater priority.Make your own conclusion on whether you want to support that or not."

As you might've guessed already, this one is one of the good ones.So, basic gameplay is simple: you choose a hero, you enter a level, you shoot baddies with your bow. You have a lot to unlock, though -- new levels (each with new enemies), new difficulties, new challenges, new heroes even. Depth of the game is one it's main perks, honestly.Another great side of Towerfall is the gameplay, of course -- fast paced action all around (speeding up even further on higher difficulties), it's as fun as it gets, especially if you're playing with a friend.All in all, I would rate this game 8.5 out of 10 and would definitely recommend it to people who enjoys great pixel art, fast-paced platformers and casual archery. Also, consider the DLC if you'll like the game, as it adds on even more content."

One of those 'easy to learn, hard to master' type deals. The mechanics are solid, it controls well, and once everybody is familiar with it you can have some incredibly intense and fun games with your buddies. Luck plays a big part early on, but once you get the hang of it, your deaths are very rarely anybody else's fault but your own.At its best the game is satisfyingly choreographic - players leap and grapple from ledge to ledge, shots collide mid-air, arrows can be dodged (and caught mid-air) with the right timing, corpses are pinned to walls, and the instant replay at the end of each round allows you to enjoy the sheer frenzy of what just happened at your leisure.Look up some multiplayer gameplay videos for the game on YouTube, those are going to be the best gauge of whether or not you're going to enjoy what's on offer here.Ignore the reviews complaining that the single player isn't strong. This is a multiplayer game. If you bought it for the single player, it's your own fault that you're not enjoying it. It's a bonus there's even a solo mode included in the game."

Super easy to get into, fun to get better at, and perhaps most importantly, infinitely replayable.It's also ridiculously polished. The art, music and sound design are all top-notch. The game manages to have this unique atmosphere that makes the matches that much more compelling.Even unlocking things in this game is a blast, with stuff getting unlocked just from playing multiplayer matches like in smash bros. That's not the reason why unlocking the stages is fun though - it's the unique animations that play. For example, a piece of the moon in the background of one stage falls off, which then crashes down to earth on the map screen and BECOMES another stage! A very hype moment indeed! After that, the piece of the moon will be missing in the background of the original stage. It's attention to detail like this that make TowerFall that little bit better than other indie local multiplayer games. All these little quirks, and yet the gameplay doesn't suffer at all. You can tell a lot of love went into this game.If you like having friends round for a night of gaming on the couch, then buying this is a no-brainer.

,Recommended,251470,27347655,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Anzhou,"This is a game that you HAVE to play with other people.  Its single player mode is tacked on and hollow (much like many modern games). I cannot recommend it if you're looking for a good single player experience. However, its incredible multiplayer more than justifies the game's reasonable asking price if you have a few controllers. While the Dark World expansion fleshes out the campaign, it is still best enjoyed when you have a few friends to share in the rage. One MAJOR caveat: the game has no online multiplayer. While the reasoning is understandable, (the game has mechanics timed down to individual frames and would be a subpar experience if there's any amount of latency involved) I believe having a poor online mode would still be superior to not having one at all.Barring those few criticisms, Towerfall Ascension is a gem of a local multiplayer brawler. You play as one of several archers (that vary only cosmetically) and have a limited number of arrows (3 by default). Once you shoot an arrow, it is left on the world and you must pick it up by walking over it. Your movement and aiming is combined into a single control, which takes some getting used to if you're new to the genre. You are only able to move and aim in 8 principle directions. The arrows you shoot home slightly if there's an enemy in range, and there are multiple arrow types that range from exploding to bouncing to piercing. Each attack is an instant kill, regardless of whether it was through shooting your opponent with an arrow, hitting them with an arrow's secondary effect, or stomping their heads in. There is also dodging, which is both your defense and mobility ability. And finally, there is screen wrap, where the top/bottom and left/right of the screen are connected.It was designed from the ground up to be played locally, and accommodates both casual and competitive play. The default game mode on headhunter is perfect for people who have never played the game, with just enough rubber-banding to keep everyone in the game without being egregious (nothing like Mario Kart's first to worst from a single blue shell). Each round is paced well, and no one ever stays hopeless or dead for too long. You can go down the list of maps to gradually introduce your friends to new items, and never really overwhelm them (unless you want to).If you're playing casually with experienced players, custom game modes vastly increase the replayability of an already replayable game. Small tweaks like spawning with special arrows or returning as ghosts result in significant changes in how you play. And finally, making an asymmetric custom mode (2v1/3v1 team death match) where one player gets huge bonuses (such as regenerating shields and arrows) while the opposing team gets an advantage in numbers is almost like playing an entirely new game. Even the more chaotic game modes (like infinite drill arrows or infinite laser arrows) are good for a round or two before you abandon them and pretend they never existed.And finally, the game is very well balanced competitively. Dodge cancelling and superjumping are difficult mechanics to master, and yield a surprisingly high skill ceiling. While there are a few oddities for a competitive game (bolt arrows finding your opponent's home from 3 zipcodes away, kicking their dog, then brutally murdering them right in the face comes to mind) it's nothing that custom rules can't fix. Because everyone has the same attacks and abilities, the only thing that sets players apart is their positioning, skill, and reflexes.Towerfall Ascension is an amazing game that I highly recommend if and only if you play local multiplayer games. Do not buy this game if you're looking for a single player game or a good story (mediocre and nonexistent respectively). However, Towerfall Ascension is one of the best local multiplayer games out there. If you own a few controllers and have people over occasionally, this game is almost mandatory."

I also find it quite fun to play through co-op levels as a solo player.One word of warning: the game is a bit pricey just by itself, but to really get the most out of it you'll very likely want the expansion. The expansion's features are fully integrated into the core game, but if  you try to use them it'll tell you you have to buy the DLC. :-pWithout the expansion, you can only play co-op with 2 players, each of whom has a fixed number of lives. The expansion adds co-op levels for up to 4 players, but there's no lives store - if a player dies, another player has to revive him, and if all players are dead the game's over (continuing is possible). These worlds can also be played solo mode with fixed lives, and unlike the core game worlds you can continue if you die on a particular level.The versus mode is quite fun, and does a great job of balancing skill levels without dampening the fun (if you're winning, you get fewer arrows, and if you're way behind you start with a shield). The number of interesting outcomes for a battle seems quite high, and I find myself saving replay GIFs regularly. Neat little details abound, such as the way you can knock someone's hood or hat off if your arrow merely brushes through their hair instead of hitting them squarely. Occasionally some odd tweak will appear unexpectedly in a co-op level, and some of these lead to unlockable new characters you can play as."

It has been the most fun game I've played with friends out of the countless games we've tried. TowerFall kept us ingaged, entertained, and Challenged for over 4 hours. The only down side is that there isn't that many levels. We finished all the co-op levels in 4.3 hours on regular difficulty. With that there is multiple ways to make the levels more challenging including adding curses to your characters (de-buffs) and harder difficulties. The controls are very tight and confortable. The movement is very fluid and makes the gameplay that much more enjoyable. There is many unique systems in the game that add depth and take to master and perfect, Example: Dodging through projectiles or Holding Dodge to catch enemy projectiles to name a few. The games pixel art is good and even though the game plays in a square resolution no one seemed to mind or notice.  The Music isn't anything special in my opinion but it's good and does it's job. The Friendly Fire mechanic presents many memorable moments and funny conflicts between friends/team-mates. Finally the combat is exquisite. It's very fun to take down the many challenging enemies. You can try and pull off a shot or you can risk getting close and try the classic head smash. It's also very fun to go for unique shots or trick shots with different kinds of arrows (Bomb/Super Bomb, Drill, Reflecting, Etc.). I'm looking forward to playing it again in the PvP modes and replaying co-op with harder difficulties."

The first night I got it, I played with one friend. Then two. Then we get all four of us playing. By the end of the night we all needed a cup of tea because we'd been screaming at the screen and each other and having a great time.The co-op is completely customizable. It's hilarious how much you can screw with the game by dictating starting gear or setting changes. My absolute favorite is to include ghosts so that when you die, you're a ghost trying to get out other players. Also? There's three different multiplayer modes--head hunter, last man standing, and team deathmatch.The single player is why I avoided the game at first. I'd seen a review saying that the single player was terrible. And actually, it's not bad. It can be single, or you can have your friends help you through the campaign. I couldn't imagine beating it alone because it's hard with just me and a partner, but I'm sure it's doable. There isn't a *ton* of content, but it's enough to have a good time, for sure. We're almost done with normal mode all through the campaign (on the last level of the expansion) but then we'll have to go back through on hardcore.What really makes the levels interesting is the bosses. They're cleverly difficult and there's a different way to beat each one.Finally, the expansion is great. It unlocks some cute aesthetic changes and adds another five or so levels of gameplay to the campaign. So whether or not it's enough content to typically warrant a $10 purchase, we wanted it so bad we bought it anyway.All in all, it's been a great investment! It's set me on a hunt to find all the great local co-op games. This is certainly one of the best I've found."

I have seen veteran gamers and people who don't play games both get hooked on Towerfall after playing just a few rounds. It is that accessible and easy to get into. But that's not to say that it's easy - it'll take countless hours of gameplay to understand the subtle tactics which will allow you to compete at high levels of play.The art style and presentation of the game is beautiful and nostalgic to anyone who grew up with games from the SNES era in the 1990's. There is no online multiplayer but the developer has explained why many times: the game is too fast to facilitate satisfying and fair online gameplay. With that said, you will want to be playing this with friends locally because that's the way that it's meant to be played.Recent updates to Towerfall have brought so much value to the game. I recommend getting the Dark World expansion pack, even more so now that it adds Steam Workshop support. Not only is there a whole new world of user-generated Towerfall content to enjoy, but the way that all of this new content is integrated into the game is brilliant.If I could only have one local multiplayer game on Steam, I would probably choose Towerfall.

That being said, the Darkworld expansion kind of fixes that problem... at least a little bit.

(likely because he has the lightning-fast reflexes of a dead sloth, and the hand-eye coordination of a blind snake, but hey.) I personally found the 'co-op' enjoyable. frustrating at times, but enjoyable. I've experienced cheap deaths a-plenty, but nothing feels more satesfactory as clearing those tough-as-nails stages on Hardcore mode.If I had to point out one issue I have with it, that would be that co-op's idea of challenge is to swarm you with enemies, up until you fight against the major boss (which I would have liked to see more of. Dark World delivers that.)but seeing as how this is a game about reflexes, that's somewhat understandable."

A party game in the truest sense, with controls easy enough to pick up that anyone can start playing in seconds. The depth of combat mechanics paired with tight controls leads to rewarding gameplay for hardcore players who can think fast and move even faster. The art style is impeccable, down to the smallest detail in animation. The music is catchy. The gameplay, sublime.That said, do not buy this game.Once more:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.**Unless you know what you're getting into. TowerFall was designed as a local co-op experience.There is no online multiplayer, and there might never be.That means if you want to play with friends, and get the most out of this game, you're gonna have to have some controllers handy. Heck, if you want to play it well, you're gonna need a controller yourself! There is singleplayer content, and it is pretty fun, but the meat of TowerFall is playing with friends, and you're gonna need controllers if you want to do that locally on a PC.If you have at least one controller at your disposal, you're doing yourself a disservice by not owning this game. If you don't, hold off unless you acquire a controller (or 4) in the future.

The sound track was okay.It's a multiplayer game which can *only* be played through local co-op/VS mode.  In theory, that shouldn't count negatively for it.  Realistically though, how often do you and your friends have time to get together and play a local co-op game?

For such a small game, it's hard to imagine the developers possibly finding any /more/ ways they could screw it up and render it unplayable.Expect ear-splittingly loud audio when you first start the game.  Setting volume at 1/10 makes it bearable, but expect a repeat performance every time you come back.  If you're unlucky like me, you won't even be able to play anyway, because the game speed is up by at least an order of magnitude - you won't even be able to navigate the menus.  If you get that fixed, still expect random timing glitches based on whether you have vsync on.But those are all bugs, and one presumes that if the developers have any shred of decency or respect for their consumers, they'll at least fix those.  No the real deal-breaker is the controls.Control mappings are backwards (jump/confirm swapped with shoot/cancel) and can't even be customized.  Countless side-scrollers that have come before have trained us to expect a competent layout that puts your most spammed inputs (movement) closest to the base of the thumb, and conversely your limited use controls further away.  But no, Towerfall went way out of its way to make it as hard as possible not to hit the wrong button /constantly/.  This and this alone renders the game an unplayable exercise in frustration just with the inputs.  The actual gameplay doesn't even factor in.Don't expect to be able to pick up their slack either.  Mapping controller keys to other controller keys is pretty much impossible or just not worth the exhorbitant effort depending on what hardware you have, and just mapping to keyboard keys won't work either - the game will then read both.I feel like an incredible sucker for buying this game on two steam accounts before I actually tried it - never even considered it could be this messed up, not when the reviews are so positive and only focus on gameplay and the lack of online play.  This wouldn't pass muster for a PC game in the 90s and would make a sub-par free flash game today.When did developers lose all respect for their customers?  We're humans, not programmable money machines.  Software conforms to us, not the other way around.  To not even bother allowing any way to remap keys - even if the default mapping weren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - is just a slap in the face.  I cannot imagine in what world falling short on even this baseline effort could possibly be considered acceptable and worthy of my money.  I want mine back, and barring that, you can at least be sure the developers responsible for this game will never swindle a penny from me ever again."

It's built in every way to be easy to start but hard to master. The Arrows are extremely well done. They go straight for the most part but will quickly fall after a little distance which allows it to be easy to hit most things but allows the expert player to use that quality to their advantage. Dodging has many uses, it's perfect for a double jump or a dash across a short gap and doubles as a way to catch arrows from the air and avoiding damage. Having to retrieve arrows is a great move in my opinion because often times just managing how to get them amid all the enemies takes the most skill.The enemies are pretty smart. They all will attack as soon as they have the opportunity and many will dodge or block your arrows if you attempt to take an easy shot at them.The screenshots are quite sad because they really don't showcase how beautiful this game really is! There is so much detail put into the different parts such as arrows catching on fire as they pass through torches, Dead enemies will often be stuck to walls with your arrows and will fall once you remove them.

(particularly Melee) and the 8-bit Kid Icarus as far as gameplay and singleplayer campaign goes. Each part is more noticable depending on whether you're playing multiplayer or campaign. And, let it be known, this was the game that, alongside Bombsquad, led me to purchasing an Ouya.It's upgraded appearance on the PS4 and on Steam are very much welcomed by me, though I have some qualms for the Steam version.The PC is, unless you hook it up to the TV, not built for local multiplayer couch parties in mind. Overall, the PC mainly focuses on online multiplayer with the likes of Quake, TF2, and League of Legends. Towerfall does not have online multiplayer, and though arguments have been made supporting its non-support (and I agree with most of them), you essentially have to get things hooked up and working properly to get a decent couch multiplayer experience with Towerfall. Best thing I will say is that the Singleplayer is a bit easier on the PC.Because, in my opinion, playing Towerfall with friends on the couch is THE best way to play it, I vastly prefer the Ouya and PS4 versions to the PC version. And, aside from these minor qualms, I think that Towerfall is one of the better combat-platformer (combatformer?) games on the market, outside of Super Smash Bros. itself. If you do not have a PS4 and want to play your PS4 game with friends, Towerfall alone is a solid reason to buy one, though at this point it's somewhat difficult to truly recommend it (hard to say with all these games getting delayed), but if you don't have one and do not intend to buy PS4 or Ouya, get it on Steam. If you have an Ouya, you need Towerfall. If you have a PS4, I will instantly recommend Towerfall Ascension. It's that good of a combatformer game.Pros: VERY Solid gameplay, neat character design (My favorite's the Thief), a unique concept that by all means may be a steep learning curve (1-hit KO on most attacks) but ends up being easy to pick up anyway. Great soundtrack, and interesting take on the pixel art aspect.Cons: If you're not familiar with the game, you may get steamrolled by other experienced players. The music, while still great, can get repetitive in the campaign. PC version is, by design of PC, hard to get that multiplayer experience without online multiplayer built-in (which is why I recommend the PS4 and Ouya versions over the PC version, at least for now). Ouya version was what got me hooked on Towerfall, but last I checked did not get the Ascension version that PS4 and PC had.Overall: 9.5/10 for PC and Ouya, 10/10 for PS4."

It's a game that makes and breaks friendships.The movement speed is insane once you become aware of the things that are possible. Catching arrows is one skill, but catching multiple arrows will dodging through the air, ending with sticking to a wall, jumping back into the open area to shoot your opponent with of the arrows you just caught, is simply brilliant.Sure it will take you time to truly master this game, which is best played with an USB controller by the way, but the road to perfection is simply brilliant.Just like other competitive arena games - take Super Smash Bros as an example - there are several extra power-ups available. These will spawn at the beginning of each match. Some power ups give you special arrows (laser arrows or bomb arrows for example), others will have an environmental influence (slow motion or rising lava). These power-ups are always a great risk to get, because you have to engage, but the reward can be big of course.On the other hand there's the tactic to avoid shooting. You start with three or two arrows and when your opponent shoot and miss, you can grab that arrow. But of course, once again, these missed arrows can also be used as a trick. Those are just two examples of how arena control can work in your advantage of disadvantage.Really, Towerfall Ascension is brilliant and all you need is this baby, four USB controllers, three friends and some drinks for an AWESOME video game evening!"

Among my friends Towerfall is already the clear favorite. However even without multiplayer, I have played 5+ hours of singleplayer and still have many more trials and secrets to unlock. If you enjoy classic arcade games and are without nearby gaming friends, I would still highly reccommend purchasing Towerfall. Improving upon times in Trials mode and beating High Scores in Quest Mode offer an endless challenge, while simply clearing all the levels on diamond and hardcore will take most people atleast 8 hours!That being said, this game truly shines when you and three of your buddies gather around the same television. With thousands of possible game variants, easy to learn but hard to master gameplay, and short enjoyable rounds I don't see myself playing any other game with my friends for a long time."

The mechanics and local co-op madness is fantastic. The game mixes platforming with archery combat so well its unbelievable.

It may appear very simple, but it can become extremely challenging very quickly. Here's a video giving you my thoughts on the single-player side of the game (for those of us who have a hard time getting friends over).http://youtu.be/K81IX5qE5JQIn summary, here are the pros and cons of the game (some as ? because it varies on the person)+ Simple controls. It makes it easy for anyone to pick up and play.+ High skill ceiling. While moving, shooting, jumping, and dodging are the only controls, using them all in combination to navigate the diverse courses while shooting down foes is more than challenging to say the least.+ Fluid gameplay. Everything responds exactly how you expect it to and when you expect it to.+ Local Multiplayer is a blast. It's very competitive, and when you win, damn do you feel good.+ Highly satisfying when you perform well. It takes a lot of skill to do this, and when you do, you know it.+ A lot of enemy variety with different mechanics.? Extremely challenging. You can make it so difficult, that you will never beat a level unless you perform near perfection. The one-hit-kill system makes this so.? Even on normal, it doesn't hold your hand. You will die and fail multiple times before you learn the map's patterns and enemies so you can complete it. The time will differ greatly from person to person.? The single player is decent. It's nowhere near as fun as the multiplayer, but that's to be expected of most games.- No tutorial. The best I could find was something in the options menu that gives you hints, but you have to look for it. With something as difficult as this, anything that helps is greatly appreciated.- IMO, I wish they used better quality sprites like the ones they have when you select your character. Just a small ding for this, though. Graphics only matter to a certain extent.- This can be very frustrating in later levels. You just can't see everything that's coming at you, and when enemies fill the screen, it only makes it that much worse. Best thing to do is set it down and come back later, but that may be never depending on how bad it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.- It's local multiplayer only. It cuts off a really good part of the game for those people who can't get people over to play. And I can't help but feel this game would've really benifited from having online servers so you can play multiplayer anytime.In conclusion, get it for the multiplayer. You're gonna have a blast with it. If you have time to kill and like a challenge, then consider getting it for the single player. It's not bad for the price.*Update*If you guys wanna see what the Co-op Quest is like, here's another video highlighting the mayhem and hilarity that it brings. To be honest, I think it even makes this game more challenging than doing it alone.http://youtu.be/Pzcb2Lb2Jbw*Final Update*Here is some of the Versus mode.

It has deceptively simple design that any one can jump into, but once you get into it, you'll see the game presents some very in depth game mechanics. It's very demanding on the player, as your skill level will decide how well you'll do.The game features single player quest mode, and local multiplayer, but seems to lack online multiplayer which is unfortunate because I feel the game would benefit greatly if it had it.But nonetheless the game is still enjoyable, even if you are playing it on your lonesomePros:- Mechanics are some of the best designed I've seen- Incredibly in depth meta- Skill based- Fluid controls- Gorgeous pixel art- Addictive playCons:- No online >.<"
76561198031257941,Recommended,251470,12067942,"Posted: 11 September, 2014",all,Super Jelly,"First off, I'll cut to the chase by saying that I 100% recommend this game. It's addictive, very quick and easy to pick up, and is fun to play alone or with up to three other people.The initial design and look of the game is surprisingly intricate considering the 2D pixel graphics. The characters have absolutely no difference in combat style or stats, but you still find yourself drawn to them and interpretting personalities purely in the way the sprites move with certain commands. This most definitely also applies to later on when more characters are unlocked. The levels themselves - which randomise every time - also look gorgeous and I'll find myself playing the same couple over and over simply due to how visually interesting they are.The combat style comes incredibly naturally. I've seen friends play for both days or only a couple of hours each and still have very good grips on the game, which is handy when it comes to playing versus mode. The stand and shoot style is simple enough and gets the job done, but even after you think you've discovered how to fight in every way possible, there'll be another trick or move you didn't realise existed and it'll add a whole new dimension to combat. It may look simple, but there are countless different strategies and styles of fighting, and that's before the countless types of arrows and pickups come into play - of which there is a strong and interesting variety.Quest mode, if you power through, can only take a day to complete. This is before completing all the challenges and more difficult settings, so if this is the only mode you're interested in or perhaps have no one to play versus with, it may not be worth the money. However, quest mode can still be done 3x each level if you're aiming for a higher reward each time, which gets many more hours out of the game. Time trials are also possible to explore and present a real challenge; I found them much more difficult than the other modes. But that may simply be because I'm not a fan of time-pressure modes and if you aren't either, this whole section may be pointless for you.Versus is a huge positive point for this game. It is fun with two people but is definitely more fun with 3-4. Even if you master quest mode, that's usually due to memorising the characteristics and attack patterns of the enemies; which isn't possible in versus. Considering it doesn't take long to get decent at the combat system, it's immediately a fun challenge and fights can go on for literally a couple of seconds or drag out until the time is over. Even though I've completed the game this is definitely a feature I will keep returning to play. This for the most part is what made the game worth my money. The only downside I will note is that it is only local multiplayer, whereas online isn't a feature. You'll have to physically endure your friend's company. Sucks, I know. Another good point to versus, however, is that it's the key to unlocking plenty of achievements both within the game and on Steam, so if you're a completionist you'll be spending plenty of time exploring this mode. There are also lots of variants you can toggle on and off (for example, coming back as ghosts to claim your revenge, which is a great one), which adds a new twist to gaming if you get bored of doing the same thing. This, along with different scoring settings, gives versus a huge variety of options and gameplay styles to experiment with.All in all, I'd absolutely recommend this game. If you're more of a casual gamer and can't see yourself pumping that many hours into it, I'd say maybe wait for it to go on sale otherwise you may view it as a bit overpriced. Otherwise, the game has tons of choice and variety, lots of secrets to unlock, and makes you feel like you're an archery master in no time. Buy it!"

Developed primarily with local multiplayer in mind, it reminds me of playing Goldeneye for the N64 with friends when I was younger. Towerfall makes me wish local multiplayer wasn’t something almost forgotten in today’s industry. If you have the local player-base, the game combines a competitive atmosphere, zany gameplay, and retro graphics to create a great experience.The aesthetics of Towerfall are very good. The graphics in the game are done in a modern pixel art style. The sound design applies simple sound effects and a solid soundtrack to ensure the game is appealing from an audio perspective. I think it is a good example of marrying sound, graphics, and style so the sum is greater than the whole. This unification gives Towerfall a unique personality.This personality spills into the character and level design. The various archers feel different, despite having no actual gameplay difference or dialogue. I feel each character was given a persona purely by their title and appearance. The levels are well done and provide a good variety of environments. Each level has different layout and graphics. I felt most levels were thematically different and allowed for different strategies to be applied. Enemy design and aesthetics are also cohesive with each level. Some levels contain specific enemies that further drive the theme of each level. Many monsters have unique behavior and weaknesses, making them feel believable and different. There are some enemy re-skins and reuse, but overall the variety is enough.There are 3 main modes in Towerfall: quest, multiplayer, and trials. Quest mode is a single player/co-op mode that I found myself primarily playing. In this mode, you go through the various levels of the game defeating waves of monsters. This mode is decent for learning the game and features a “hardcore” difficulty, but I didn’t feel the need to play through it again. Trials mode is similar to the target run in Super Smash Bros. This mode was fun to play through once but like the quest mode, I personally wouldn’t go back. Overall I found the single player modes somewhat boring. I only really found myself playing through the levels to just see the new enemies and gather some unlockables.The game is marketed at couch multiplayer and the arena is where the designer’s dream is realized. It allows 2-4 people to test their skills and has a full array of options to modify the game such as changing win conditions, items available, and level variables. There is even a system to give losing or inexperienced players a handicap. The mode is well polished and is something I can see playing on game nights for a long time.The actual gameplay is what makes Towerfall great. It is crisp and simple enough for anyone to learn. Characters can simply only shoot arrows, move, jump, and dash. Compounding upon these basic actions, the designer added more features to enhance gameplay. For example, the arrows have slight homing properties. This allows players to not have completely accurate aim(which can be hard with only 8 way aim) but still be competitive. There are also a lot of various power ups. Things like shields, bomb arrows, wings, and drill arrows all work to create dynamic scenarios and open up strategic options. I found myself starting to focus on one type of power up to fit my play style. This all comes together to give a strong sense of flow. I always felt like a badass, dodging two arrows, catching the third, and firing it midair for a kill. Win or lose the gameplay is fast, fun, and furious.My praise for the game is overshadowed a bit by some things though. The controls and movement system take a bit of getting used too. I was pretty frustrated until I learned the nuances. As I said above, the single player content is somewhat boring. Maybe leaderboards or something could have helped. This game hinges on being able to play with friends, without others the experience is extremely short. This is a game I’d highly recommend everyone to try out. I’d only warrant a purchase if multiplayer sessions could be set up.Play if you:- Like games that are easy to learn but hard to master.- Reminisce about local gameplay.- Want to dive into a theme that is whimsical and fun.Pass if you:- Don’t have friends to play the game with.- Are tired of the pixel art look in indie games.- Prefer games with a story or more developed single player mode.My recommendation: Pass. The game is great, but I can’t really recommend buying unless you have the friends to play with.Score: 7/10.Follow me:Twitter:twitter.com/TyrrexxTumblr:tyrrexx.tumblr.comFollow the developer here:twitter.com/MattThorson"

Towerfall: Ascension works equally well as a competetive experience and a casual party game--a feat not acheived since, arguably, Super Smash Bros. Melee.For the uninitiated: Towerfall: Ascension is a two-dimensional, single-screen, local-only multplayer game in which two to four players attempt to be the last person standing by launching volleys of arrows and squishing heads like an Italian plumber on a small mushroom creature. The mechanics are simple--providing you controls for moving, shooting, jumping, and dodging alone--but offer a level of depth I have barely begun to penetrate.If you want to really shake things up, though; Towerfall offers a crazy amount of variants, all of which can be combined in any configuration. Want infinite arrows? Got it. Exploding corpses? Got that, too. Exploding corpses that trigger on command of the deceased? Oh yeah, it's got that.Towerfall does offer single or multplayer Quest and Trials mode, which are very fun in their own right, and can be crazy addicting if you're looking to master the game, but the real meat and potatoes is in the competitive multplayer. So, if you don't have many friends to play with IRL, or enough controllers to acommodate them, give this one a pass, but if you want to relive the days of your childhood when you had your friends over to play Smash Bros., Goldeneye, MarioKart, et al, you cannot afford to miss this game.Do I recommend it?

There are upgrades and different TYPES of arrows to try to reach before your most hated foes (friends :)). You must be the last man standing, yet the game is based on SCORE. Therefore you must choose between going all-in or hanging back and playing defensive.You have the highest score. A flurry of arrows fly in your direction. What do you do?! Evade into the arrows, catching them! Now not only do you have more arrows than your enemy, but you're above them as well. You wall slide gracefully and plop on your friend's head almost in slow motion. Splat. Two more to go...That all happens within a second's time. TowerFall is ridiculously intense and thrilling. Arrows missed will be left pierced into the ground or wall, waiting to be picked up.

You can shoot them at the other players, which follows some gravity, and occasionally has a slight homing effect to allow for impressive long shots. You can also simply choose to jump on the other player, often ending up the easier choice. Finally, there's a Dodge ability you can use to get away from an explosion, or even to catch arrows. One shot or stomp is all it takes, and when only one player is alive, a round is over and you move on to the next one.The game offers you other arrow types mid-match, like laser arrows, bomb arrows, bramble arrows, etc. While there's always a little more to learn, it's easy for a new player to pick up the basics."

It might not look like it, but even with the basic premise this game has a lot of replay value and a high skill ceiling that could also permit competitive play, apart from having so many tiny details and interactions that make for some really funny and memorable situations that the awesome auto replay feature will be there to save for you. And if you ever do get tired of the game play, there are also tons of options you can activate to make for some really diferent type of games.My only problem was that I couldn't set non-xbox controlers, but this was my experience in Linux and I don't know how it works in Windows, better check the forums for that.9/10, would play over Super Smash any day."

Controls default are move, jump, shoot, and dodge.  Shoot your opponents or jump on their heads to kill them.  You can catch arrows by dodging at the right time.Different weapons and powerups (Bomb arrows, bolt arrows, etc) make play very interesting.  There is abundance, and everything has a use.The pac-man style looping of the levels is awesome.  Shoot through the left site to hit the right side, fall through the bottom to get to the top.Good handicapping for the players in the lead/behind.  If you're in the lead you get less arrows at start.  If you're last you get a free shield.  This levels the field and makes games fun for both beginners and veterans.Lots of options, virtually everything can be toggled.Cheat codes exist to unlock everything, in case you don't ever want to play this single-player.Your friends will rage at you when you catch all of the arrows then proceed to stomp on their heads instead of shooting them.Arrows have a very slight tracking, if the initial shot is close enough.  This takes the thought out of whether or not you should shoot.DLC has enough new stuff to justify the price, but is absolutely not required to have fun.Game is damn fun.There are hilarious awards given at the win screen based on how you and your opponents played.  I think I got a ""bomb squad"" award for catching bomb arrows, or ""super booper"" for jumping on a lot of heads.Negatives:Single player campaign is overly hard.  Thankfully all levels/characters can be unlocked by a cheat code.  I have a feeling that if you can play through the single player most of your friends will not want to play with you because you'll become ""too good"".Versus becomes better the more players you have.  2 player is meh, 3 player is above-average, 4 player is insane fun.No internet multi-player.   This especially hurts if you have multiple friends that own this game and want to keep unlocks in sync without resorting to the cheat code.Some of the stuff to do the level/character unlocks is insanely hard.Playing without a controller is a bad idea."

Of course, within two or three hours, I beat my progress on the PS4 version. This game is incredibly fun, and it's actually relatively versatile, too. Depending on how you like to play, you could:•Play with others, where this becomes a fun, lethal, adrenaline-pumping contest, OR;•Play on your own against the evil forces of something, where this becomes the single most stressful, rage-inducing, soul-destroying game ever.The idea of playing with archers is really well thought-out, and it has several mechanics which are absolutely brilliant. The major one is dodging, where you can dash into arrows and collect them. You'll find out just how important that is in singleplayer, where you're often facing multiple enemy archers at once. Speaking of the archers, their AI is horrifyingly efficient, and they tend to kill you in CQC even when out of arrows.The soundtrack for this game is absolutely beautiful, and right from the start of the main menu theme, you get the feeling that this is going to be a good game. And TowerFall: Ascension does not disappoint me. It's a beautiful game and it is definitely worth the money."

,Recommended,251470,34726114,Posted: 3 September,all,KatanaKat58,"This is my favorite multiplayer game on Steam. There's nothing better than the panic of sitting on the couch with a friend and shouting at the TV while we scramble to stomp on one another's heads since we've already launched every arrow in our arsenal. This game has a wonderful cooperative quest mode for one or more players in addition to its versus mode. It can be very challenging at times but it always feels rewarding to complete a difficult stage. There's also a time attack mode for striking dummies and showing off.Everything is animated beautifully, this isn't just another ""retro"" styled game with so much clunky movement. There are so many tiny details. A lot of care was put into making this game breathe; it looks and sounds wonderful.The Dark World DLC is a good expansion on the game, it adds more cooperative levels, additional bosses to take down, alternate archer characters/outfits, as well as the addition of Steam Workshop support; you can create your own versus stages and share them with the community.IF Towerfall Ascension had online multiplayer I doubt I'd play much of anything else!"
