,Recommended,251490,14254043,"Posted: 30 January, 2015",all,AuspexAO,"Childlike without being childish, Gravity ghost is a much deeper experience than the first few moments suggest. The game follows a young girl named Iona as she traverses the cosmos to piece together memories that will ultimately tell her story. Gameplay revolves around (ha ha) making the most of Iona's ever-expanding control over the physical rules of the world. Some examples of her powers include becoming more massive to fall faster or becoming incorporeal to pass through objects. She also learns ""terraforming"" abilities that allow her to change the properties of the planetary bodies that form most of the game world.Just like the game, the story is a mix of whimsy and challenges, this time in the form of human interaction between Iona's family unit. The characters are voiced by several indie darlings such as Ashly Burch and Logan Cunningham. The story is told in snippets so at first it can be difficult to even understand the relationships between the characters. However, as you learn who they are and how they relate to Iona, you realize their connection to her celestial journey. The game's music is also noteworthy, as it is the work of Ben Prunty, the man responsible for the excellent FTL score. You can expect the same lonely and beautiful music in Gravity Ghost.I finished this game in one sitting (I clocked about 4 hours for 10% completion) so the game doesn't outstay it's welcome. The rate at which Iona gains new powers and abilities kept me completely hooked the entire time. I won't claim the story is mindblowing, but it is a touching tale of family and the way we, like the planets circling our star, have an invisible force keeping us together. I recommend it highly to fans of whimsical, innovative indie titles."

The game has a strong visual aesthetic that seemingly uses southwestern USA influences (Pueblo?) that draws your attention but never distracts from the gameplay at hand. It's complemented by a haunting sound track that's not depressing, but fits the themes that the game is going for. The gameplay can be entertaining and frustrating at the same time: it definitely opens up once you get the float/dive mechanics to get more control over your character, and the use of both of those mechanics to whip yourself around the planets can be good old fashioned fun: even if it may have frustration for some precision you will need. It's a game that won't wow you on gameplay, but will wow you on charm instead, and it's a shame that the game was exploited in terms of scammers/people posing as youtubers (in a black market key investigation), because the game is a memorable one that may stick with those that have had people in their lives recently pass on. It's definitely worth picking up if you like stories with heart, and want some gameplay to boot.Gameplay Footage and Video Review (part of a collection video):https://youtu.be/mZnKPYCM5nk?t=598Lists:+:A touching story about loss and acceptance that pulls on the heartstrings. Good writing and voice acting helps to set the mood, but it's also not overly sappy as well.Strong visual aesthetic that is unlike a lot of games out there. Has a child like feel to it and yet hits some heavy themes, but strong use of color is what stands out here.A haunting soundtrack that fits the themes here, and yet isn't depressing surprisingly. Feels appropriate at every turn.Core gravity mechanics are fun to just whip yourself around with not a care in the world. I'd make a joke about whipping your hair back and forth here, but let's be honest that meme is dead.Honestly, it's one of those things where you may not make any progress in game, but you can have the time of your life just floating around the map.Good addition of alternate mechanics like terraforming that are introduced at the right time to keep gameplay fresh.It deserves mention that the developers seemed to have their hearts in the right place with the initial offer of a copy for friends, and even though they were scammed and hurt by people wanting to make a profit, still kept a positive outlook on things.-:Do wish there was a timer to register how fast you could do a level. It does have a skill element that has me which for leaderboard functionality, for once.When re-recording this, wish there was a easy way to record cutscenes. I know that seems like a youtuber complaining, but with some of the touching cutscenes here, it would be nice to be able to replay them easily.Lacking some basic options. Like the ability to mute the sound within the game. Actually, no options whatsoever."

It's adorable and the story I saw looks like it's shaping up to be heartbreaking, but the gameplay is tedious and doesn't look to be evolving much.I might continue to play after that, but for a damning, nauseating interface flaw. After each stage/level/room, the game returns to the main map, Unfortunately, when it does so, the camera always starts oriented ""north"" on the topmost part of the map, and then quickly pans and rotates to your current position. While you may not notice it during the few zones, as you begin to rotate around the centerpoint of the map, this becomes horribly disorienting and potentially nauseating, which is a first in video games for me."

It just isn't quite good enough for what i hoped to get out of a 15 euro game.My main problem with this game is the gameplay. Almost every level is one of two things, either it is easy to a point of being boring or it is annoying. The powers you get early in the game just make it so that you can get almost anywhere pretty easily, and the times where it isn't easy, is when you are fighting the controls because the movement in the game is chaotic.And even when there is a level wherein it is difficult to get the star, the best strategy is of often just to jump at it and hope for the best. It isn't a puzzle, you just try and often succeed. (And yes there are proper puzzles in the game but they are few and far between.)I found the artstyle to be wierd and not that good. But others seem to like it, so take a look at some of the screenshots and judge it yourself.The story is the main positive of the game, and it was the only reason why i felt compeled to continue playing. I just dont think its good enough to be the reason why you buy the game at full price.In summation. The best strategy for almost every level is ""jump at it and hope for the best"" which make the gameplay boring. The story is good, but not quite good enough. Wait for a sale."

,Recommended,251490,14212990,"Posted: 28 January, 2015",all,Keizgon,"Let me just start off with this simple statement: Galaxy Ghost is a heart-warming experience for all ages.The story compelled me with various emotions and the game-play enhanced them, as if trying to merge together and grow as a whole. For me, it did this exceedingly well where I would call it a classic. Just like the story, the game is simple, but it evolves the complexity as subtle and elegant. Tie that together with an amazing yet soothing soundtrack, and it instantly becomes a top game of the year contender of 2015 for me.At first glance, I was unsure what the target demographic was for the story. After I played a few more cut-scenes, I quickly threw the ""Just for kids"" assumption out the window. If I were to compare it to something, I would probably say the narrative is most relatable to a good fairy tale in a clever and compelling game format. If I were to be more precise, or rather relatable to my 1990s childhood, I would say comparable to an excellent G rated movie (albeit short, old Disney classic), reminding me that subject matter can be literally any audience without beating a ""happy happy, children always be happy"" theme into you. Nope, the subject matter is much more diverse with some of it being a little grim.It literally strung me and my emotions along in wonder as the story unfolded in a somewhat mystery-memory format. Much of the happiness was expressed through the game-play as I traversed through this beautiful universe. While short (roughly 3-4 hours), I found myself traveling through all the levels just to get that (optional?) cut-scene out of my own intrigue. As a mystery-esque story, the scenes are not linear and you can view them in any order to understand who the protagonist is, what made her who she is now, and what she needs to do next.The game-play centers around collecting stars (progression), flowers (terraform resource), and animal spirits to return to their original skeletal bodies (which triggers a narrative piece) in a 2D space platformer. In order to traverse around, you will be using the gravity physics through jumping, free falling, along with gravity's effect on momentum. However, further progression will allow you to do more with extra abilities like gliding, force falling via increasing your gravitational pull, dashing, air jumping, etc. Obstacles are various elemental planets (platforms), which you can change with your terraform ability, given you have enough ""hair resource"". Each planet-type is unique in how it behaves as an obstacle and can assist you in traversing to the destination, or collectible, you are trying to reach.You cannot die in this game, only progress. Replayability is somewhat limited to just achievements, but I personally was immersed enough to know I will be revisiting this hidden gem from time to time. It just was too memorable of an experience to forget.If the developer decides on creating a sequel, I certainly hope they put as much love and care into it as they did this one. I will be buying it instantly for that high-quality creativity.So if you want to lose yourself in a well written story, have fun with creative game-play, or just simply want to play a game and relax, then this is a must buy of 2015."

This game doesn't have a great soundtrack. It has a serviceable soundtrack with questionable sample quality that is a little better than the things you'd find on newgrounds at the boon of flash games, but it is by no means ""great"" and I cannot recommend paying extra for the soundtrack edition. This is coming from someone who collects VGM and usually opts for the soundtrack edition of most games, but I'm glad to say that I decided to play this game before spending the extra $5 on the soundtrack.That's my only real gripe, and I could go into why, but I doubt most people care. I find it interesting that the person who made this OST is apparently known for making the music to other games though, and I find that more than a little disappointing."

Personally wasn't fond of the animation style in the cutscenes, but it grew on me by the end of the game and fitted the childlike essence of the story. Speaking of which, the story was surprisingly hard-hitting and I found myself wiping a tear from my eye when I had finished. Just one thing to bare in mind is that the controls are quite difficult to get to grips with, but even so it was a fun gaming experience with a moving story and soundtrack to match."

Beneath its pleasant scenery and deceptively simple gameplay, there's a stirring game about love and loss and shifting heaven and earth - literally - to help your loved ones.This game has a lot going for it. The art style is magnificent, and has a wonderful hand-drawn storybook feel throughout. The characters pop and the galaxy dances along. Ben Prunty's soundtrack provides a wonderful counterpoint, feeling spacey and grand without feeling too isolated, and the voice acting is solid across the board, particularly Ashly Burch's performances.The gameplay itself has a lot going for it, focusing on physics-based challenges involving the masterful manipulation of gravity. These challenges feel good on the whole and most of them should be doable within a few tries and there are no consequences for failure, leaving you encouraged to take another swing at grabbing that star.The story is excellent, though I hate to say too much about it for fear of any spoiling that may occur. Settle in and enjoy it.However, there are some negative aspects to consider as well. First, while the art style is gorgeous and the gameplay animations are smooth, there are times when the cinematic animations get a bit messy. Maybe this was just my computer, but occasionally a character's mouth would lag behind when their head was moving. A minor issue, but it brought me out of the universe of the game for a moment.Also, while the forgiving gameplay helps prevent frustration, it also contributes to a short playtime - I grabbed all of the stars and finished the game in under 3 hours. There's still a few more things to explore, but don't expect a 10-hour game going in. This game gets in, says what it has to say, and gets out.Along those lines, I'll wrap up this review by encouraging you to give it a try. There's a lot to like in ""Gravity Ghost"" - I think you'll be glad you made the trip."

The game is immensely short (3 hours tops) and in no way challenging at all. The only thing that might get you to curse are the controls. No, they don't suck, but due to the nature of the game (gravity manipulation) you don't have direct control. You can jump and then float through space, using gravity to get around (i.e. the mass of planets). There are different planets (and thus elements) in the game that you can use, altering a planet's element will change its gravity properties, however this is not required to win the game, just to get all the stars, which you don't need (you need 60 out of 94 or so). All you really need to do to win is find the guardians and complete their objective. Again, those objectives are not difficult, they simply require some fiddling around. You'll get it eventually and you can't die.The story is a sad one and told in hand drawn cutscenes, but ultimately forgettable. Might be a cool game for younger people, though. I DID have fun with the game, don't get me wrong, but it's neither a puzzler nor a platformer. It's a mix of both without being any of those genres. Also artistically interesting.

The game is very easy and lacks challenge, except for a couple stand-out difficult puzzles. It's very casual and could be considered cute. However, being able to navigate orbital space with shifting gravity fields, I never really felt in control; I used the controls as they were progressively revealed, but they surprised me in their ineffectiveness. Having said that, the game is generous in providing new controls that easily solves every new problem. Progression is fast: I could beat some stages in a matter of seconds. Finally, I came to this game on the recommendation of the music. I thought that the game soundtrack was okay but it wasn't noteworthy or enhance the gameplay experience. It's an amateur game that could be easily dismissed. It plays on the romantic theme of ghosts being able to affect the living world, which is nonsense if you don't believe in that sort of thing. It dabbles in science but relies on feelings. It's smart but stupid at the same time."

One of the most relaxing games out there, but don't for a second get the misbelief that its boring.""The story is lived out in reverse. As you are collecting the animal spirits and terraforming planets you will relive the backstory about the little girl and her animal friends. For this kind of game it's a really good way of telling the story, because the intresting plot does not lie in what happens next, but what happened earlier, before you wake up as a ghost. You will also meet some guardian animals thatr really stand out. The game deliver it's message while still managing to keep the humour.There is basically not an options menu. There's resolution and subtitle settings and that's it. I'm not sure it needs a more detailed graphical menu because of the simple yet good looking artstyle, although it would be nice with some sound sliders. Any computer should be able to run this with no problem.Gameplay wise there's not much to talk about. You use gravity as a tool to gain flowers to extend your hair (yes you read correctly) and collect stars aswell as animal spirits and planet parts. The atmosphere is very calm and serene and you can't die (obviously because you're already a ghost...), which makes the game very relaxing. It is the perfect game if you had a rough day and don't have the energy to play anything complicated.I really reccomend that you give this game a try and also, if you like the game you can spread the love because you get a gift copy to give to a friend for free when you purchase the game."

The mechanics, however always feel fresh and varied, and never worn out, at least to me. On a whole, I thoroughly recommend this game."

Like many indie puzzlers, just about the time the puzzles should get hard it finishes up, which can be a bit of a let down. That said, it's $15, you really can't expect much more than that. Overall very good though, 10/10 would recommend."

Not a boring moment in it, fully complete in a few hours, a great way to unwind, feel accomplished, and maybe grow your soul a bit. (As well as your hair!) I'd love to see more games like this, especially nice compared to all the run and gun, sexualised, violence cherishing tripe out there. Even compared to other standout indie titles, this is a gem.  9/10"

The character development has kept me caring for everyone on screen and the art & sound ties it together nicely. It's a healthy meal of a game totaling around 3.5 hours with more, or less, depending on your maneuvering skills.If I were nitpicking, then I would say that level design caused me some frustration, but not much. This occured mostly on the levels where the use of the orbiting concept was required (or where you use the main tool of gravity to slingshot you into a satellite-like pattern around a planet). I want to say that the game doesn't ease you into these stages like it does for other concepts. You can solve many of these levels in many different ways, the concept of orbiting one of them, but I never really opted for it until it was required. This is the big scary of level design that is hard to overcome in the development of any game, ensuring that concepts can be grasped by ALL of your audience in a way that doesn't overly frustrates them (or frustrating them to the point where they close the game).Edit: I also nearly forgot to mention, PLEASE add button rebinding as I know that a lack of this ability can alienate a good chunk of gamers.However, that's just me nitpicking, the concept was executed really well and it's an overall great game to give 2015 a good start!"

The animation is very smooth in a poetic and colorfull universe. There is an intriguing storyline, contemplative musics, simple but fun gameplay and each level is different. The basis of the gameplay is somehow like a platform game but it is not designed for teenager reflexes. It is really easy and relaxing, and you can not lose so there is no frustration about replaying again and again a level and progression is smooth.Great game !"

,Recommended,251490,14493203,"Posted: 15 February, 2015",all,xemplate,"Gravity Ghost is a physics game for people who suck at physics games.The art style is bright and childish, but intentionally so; visually it has a rather charming storybook feel offset by pleasant, vaguely electronic music. Surprisingly for the genre, Gravity Ghost has a strong story and uses every aspect of the game to tell it. Not only are there paper-craft style cutscenes narrated by actual voice actors rather than a bewildered FedEx guy who wandered into the office, but even the game mechanics and apparently abstract level designs eventually prove to tie into the narrative.  The overarching story kept me playing through it for longer stretches than I'd usually accord of puzzle/physics game, the non-linear narrative contributes to its replay value. The plot is more interesting when uncovered through the course of the game, so just think Lilo and Stitch in Purgatory.This game is very forgiving. The core mechanic is utilizing gravitational pull to slingshot yourself around various planets, and as you progress through levels you'll acquire various power-ups. If you're clever you can use said power-ups (converting one type of platform to another, gliding, double-jumping, passing through solid objects) in a strategic way. If you're like me and play like you have two bricks strapped to your elbows you can simply glide around relying on the starting mechanics until you stumble on to the solution. Not only is there no death (note the ""ghost"" in Gravity Ghost), but the primary goal of achieving a star is typically very attainable and will allow you to complete the level even if you can't or don't want to acquire the power-up. In fact, if you're overly frustrated you can quit to the menu at any time without penalty and revisit the level later. There are a few optional goals in certain levels, such as reuniting a spirit with its bones, but they aren't crucial. The reward for completing them, however, is context for the story. You can skip them, but I wouldn't on your first playthrough.There is a little puzzling involved, mostly on the penultimate stage of each ""level"". However, while these can be slightly time-consuming they aren't difficult enough to be unfair. While these levels are required to finish the story component they can be easily skipped for those who just want to while away the time. It's a clever mechanic that lets the player decide what kind of experience they want: narrative, or simple time-sink. I suggest the narrative. It's worth it."

I took it as a sign. The art style drew me in, but other than that I went into this game blind. There have been countless times where I would watch and read all kinds of reviews on games, buy them, and still feel unsatisfied with the purchase, so I've lately been a bit skeptical at buying games. I just really wanted to play this.This game is remarkable. It celebrates everything that makes indie games unique and offer experiences that no big titles ever could. There is a lot of soul in this game, as you will discover within the first minute of playing it.If you're after technicalities of the game: it plays beautifully. No frame rate issues, no crashes, no unresponsive controls. Game looked stunning at 1920x1080. Kudos to this small team of devs doing what, for some reason, huge publishers are unable to do: realease COMPLETED games.So, what is Gravity Ghost? It's a small tale that unravels itself slowly to you, leaving your imagination to fill in the blanks of the mythos and history surrounded the story (and I mean that in a good way). The way the story is told, and the pacing of it, is perfect. Is this an epic story that will knock you off your seat? Nope. But it IS a very well thought-out tale, that once it's revealed to you in full, kind of makes you go ""...woah"". It is haunting and it is beautiful, and I found myself teary-eyed once everything came together.... still not sure if that was out of sadness or just being so thrilled with this experience.From my understanding, the devs spent their savings on this game, and I think that's why the quality was so high. They did it because they wanted to. No kickstarter, no abandoned beta's, no shoving empty promises out the door in order to make a quick buck - how many times have we all put good faith in devs who promise the world, and leave us with unfinished, uninspired, betas... or sometimes not even that?The point is, these are the kinds of people we should be supporting. And I thank them for letting their integrity be put above profit.In any case, do I recommend this game? Absolutely, without question."
,Recommended,251490,32143228,Posted: 2 June,all,BlessedHellfire,"I'm a little on the fence about this one, tbh. The good: I really liked the aethestic (everything looks like it's drawn in chalk), and the music is seriously gorgeous. Like so good I think I'm going to be listening to the OST for awhile. The real winner here is the story. The voice acting and story is so enthralling and interesting that it actually makes you want to go for a complete run so you can get everything. It doled out powerups right when things would start to get stale, which kept things fun and refrained from getting stale.On the downside though, it's ridiculously easy. Some of the ""puzzles"" are a little tricky but once you know what to do it's just a matter of making it work.  And while you eventually get pretty good control of yourself because of powerups, it can be frustrating to do what you want to do and not fly off into the abyss for a few minutes. Also, the game is short. I got a full completion in about 2 hours, but I wouldn't necessarily call that a negative since I have a feeling this was built for speedruns. There's an achievement for beating it in under 50 minutes.Verdict: If you like platformers, chill music, and just kind of zoning out while floating through space then this is pretty dope. If you like a bit of a challenge and don't care about story, you could skip this. But overall, I think it would absolutely be worth picking up during a sale. The normal $15 price tag is a little silly to me, personally."
