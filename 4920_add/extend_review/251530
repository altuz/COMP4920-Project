,Not Recommended,251530,13763503,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,Bob the Builder,"Firstly, I would like to mention that I personally enjoy the Anomaly Series and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Anomaly Korea is a Tower Offense game, instead of the traditional Tower Defence games. This makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games.With that said, the original intention of creating Anomaly Korea is to be played on mobile devices, rather than on a PC. As this is a game meant for mobile devices, it is pretty much the same as the gameplay style of the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth, just that you would realise that there are no keyboard shortcuts, making it unfriendly for PC gaming.For PC gaming, my recommendation would be to get Anomaly: Warzone Earth or Anomaly 2, instead of Anomaly Korea as I find those meant for PC gaming more enjoyable and with keyboard shortcuts, making the overall gameplay more convenient rather than having to use the mouse all the time. Unless you are a hard-core fan of the Anomaly Series, don’t get this game and save up the money for Anomaly: Warzone Earth or Anomaly 2 for a better gameplay experience."

It's Tower Offense rather than defense as you operate and command a convoy to destroy towers and generally have to get to a specific point to complete your objective. Other objectives are more in recovery of data though for you as the player it boils down to just arriving somewhere still intact.The game does a good job of introducing mechanics as well as the types of units available and what uses they might have. There aren't THAT many but enough to create some pretty decent strategies as well as make some fairly frantic experiences in real time. Tanks, Shield units, APC's and missile launchers. You're in charge of their order and the path they take through the city.The main mechanic you'll be dealing with is planning a path (that can be changed at any point) and placing power ups down to aid your convoy in completing the mission. Power ups are dropped from air support and can include things like damage boosts, repair kits, smoke screens and decoys among other things. All are placed with a specific diameter and duration and for the most part are useful in dealing with a specific type of tower. There are also situations where you must travel inside and air support is not available or timers are placed for example to keep a bridge down. Admittedly, these timed sequences are not the most relaxing stages as there is no active pause and this can lead to some sporadically frantic gameplay to keep your convoy alive.You can also at any time change the order of the convoy. This is especially useful with shielded units to keep the front man from taking excessive damage.THE GISTThe game is not that long, as I stated, it is a mobile port. You can tell mostly from its jarringly egregiously oversized UI. It is a decently fun romp especially if you can get it on sale.Follow my curation for more"

Upgrades are fun, and you have to look at your game and follow closely to win, unlike a lot of others which you can just sit back and drink your coffee. Or beer. Or whatever it is you drink.ProsMusicGameplay as a reverse tower defense is interestingGraphics for this kind of game is goodActually has a small storyline you can followConsOnly 12missionsGameplayI've not played any other Anomaly games before this, so bear that info in mind.A strategy reverse tower defense game, you set our your troop's directions on a map based on the mission purpose and the enemies  dotted around it. Once you've worked/planned out your route, you then watch the results of your choice with the option to add boosts, repairs,  and abilities to improve your troop's chance of succeeding their mission.  You have to be careful about where and when you use your boosts and upgrades to increase your success in a mission. You can get extra vehicles and boosts added during the level as well.It's a simple game limited in what you can do as you follow a predetermined path that you set up at the start. The birds eye angle makes it visually easier to see how your units progress and what's coming up.The graphics are quite good for this type of game, and the effects are pleasing. Its basicly a war tower offense game and that is what you can see on the graphics. The shooting- the towers- everything looks just really nice. And not to forget... EXPLOSIONSIt's like a reverse tower defense game. Instead of you building the towers, you're the mobs running through the defenses, trying to survive. The different POV here to this type of game is something I like.You complete missions for cash and bonuses, increased by the score you gained. Completing gives gold and a score, which can be used for upgrading and purchasing/unlocking new vehicles. Your missions are timed as well, making you choose the shortest path with the least resistance, though it seems quite a lot of the time the shortest path is the hardest and riskiest for your units.  It depends as well on the enemies you have to face as some are a lot more lethal than others. I find it gets challenging quite fast which leaves you needing to use your boosts and gold to make it through the missions, which can limit the chance to upgrade. It's also tactical to be able to rearrange the order your vehicles move in, especially when they're taking a lot of damage to save them.The running dialogue from the characters/units at the start of each mission and during help to give it a more urgent feel to the missions.  You don't really get personal info about them, just their reactions in the war zone, and a brief statement of the mission at hand. Though the story isn't amazingly detailed, there is one there and you do know what you're doing the missions for.The music for this game is actually really interesting during the selection menus - easily the kind you would expect in a movie.You can hear the influence of Korea in it and a driving rhythm makes the game a lot more atmosphere and tense. However, it doesn't take over the game and distracts the player, so it leaves you room to be able to focus on what is happening, so big plus there.It's surprisingly engaging for a game where you design the outcome at the start then follow through. These kind of games have the potential to get boring really fast because of the limited interaction /direct control  you have, as in you don't personally drive the vehicles through the map – they follow the path that is set out. As a reverse tower defense game, I actually really like this.There is the option for more game modes so there's more to do after you complete the main missions, which is nice.Seems quite a short game, only 12 missions. I'm aware it's an expansion, though I still think they could have done a little bit more. Though having said that there is some extra gamemodes as wellWant moar?Click here to join my steam groupandClick here to follow my curator page!"

76561198093669682,Recommended,251530,13064554,"Posted: 23 November, 2014",all,HappyTechpriest,"Well, I finally got Anomaly Korea, so lets see how good this is. (I have played this game a LOT more than 13 minutes)Anomaly Korea is a top-view reverse tower defense game, when you are in control of a task force whose goal is either destroy all towers or get to a certain point on the map. The game starts off after the events of the original Anomaly. You play as a commander fighting a war against a race of sentient alien machines (that is literally what they are called). They have now targeted korea, and you are the only thing in the way of the machines at the moment. So, lets get to the review.Pros:- Good graphics, great visual effects.- A variety of vehicles at your disposal. From mechs to tanks to mobile shield generators.- You can change the formation of your convoy. (protip: keep your most powerful unit at the front to soak up damage)- There are special tactics you can use in the battle. You can use anything from healing to smokescreen.- Campaign is really good. Got me hooked in the first 10 minutes.- (I think this is the best part) you can change the course of your units mid-battle, which allows you to make split decisions when something new shows up.- Runs smoothly even on weak computers with decent graphics.Cons:- The game gets a little repetetive later on.- You have to play the first game in order to understand what actually happened beforehand. (for instance: where did these machines come from? What is their goal other than destroy everything?)- No multiplayer. :(Overall, this game is a great game to get if you are into reverse tower defense games. It mixes strategic path making and fast reaction skills to make an excellent strategy game. It's graphics are pretty good for being a port from a mobile game. There are actually uses and purposes for having certain units in your convoy.I give this game a 7/10 (Definitely worth a look). This game is awesome if you are a fan of strategy and tower defense. If you are new to the franchise, I highly recommend this game to start off with. The storyline is gripping, and it actually feels like you are fighting a war against giant robots."

I think the Anomaly games are worth their price they are frequently in humble bundles and steam sales. If your looking for a cheap fun game pick it up."

76561197969417125,Recommended,251530,19177630,"Posted: 20 November, 2015",all,G00N3R,"Anomaly Korea is an extra campaign for Anomaly Warzone Earth. Gameplay is the same tower offence style where you buy units and select the route they will use to travel around the map, while destroying or avoiding the alien towers. You don't have the commander unit, but can still deploy powers by clicking where you want to use them.The campaign is only 3.5 hours long, but there are a few additions that provide a fresh tactical challenge. A new type of tank has a powerful special attack that gains charge from each tower you destroy. A new power increases the firing speed and range of your units. And some maps have special conditions such as zones where your powers are disabled, or time limits to clear an area of the map.If you enjoyed the original game, you should get some entertainment from Korea, but you might want to wait for a sale."

It does not build on the squad units from Warzone Earth and Anomoly 2, instead it takes you back to basic units, and requires that you go through trainnig on the use of these units again.  It is better than Warzone Earth, Mobile Campaign, but just barely.  I hope the final chapter (Defenders) is back to the quality and interesting gameplay of Anomaly 1&2."
