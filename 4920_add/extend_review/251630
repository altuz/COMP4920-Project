It's a clear copy of The Impossible Game, but it's better in almost every single way. It has more levels, a generally better soundtrack, some harder levels, more features, prettier, fewer bugs (Geometry Dash doesn't crash from time to time!), a more convenient and more active portal for community levels, more possibilities, cheaper, and just more fun in general. I think the only thing that The Impossible Game does better is its level editor, but Geometry Dash is definitely no slouch in that respect.Again, it sucks I have to recommend the copycat, but I cannot recommend this when it's so thoroughly trumped by Geometry Dash."

,Not Recommended,251630,10341054,"Posted: 3 June, 2014",all,SumPneguin (More like GAY),"The Impossible Game is by far one of my favorite game with an awesome soundtrack, but I would say don't buy it on Steam. Why? It's because this game is not as impossible as the one on the iPad. When I was playing on the iPad, it shows a hard challenge, and that you must be precise where you jump, and is more fast-paced. But in the Steam version, they make the game easier. For example, in the Original Level, there's this part with 2 pathes, one leads to death, and the other continues. They removed that path, which disappoints me. The jumping in the game also seems to be higher, making it easy to jump through triple spikes, but also easy to over jump a block (which doesn't matter as much). Also, in Level 3, Heaven, they make the spacing between triple spikes bigger, making it way much easier get near the end. And because of this change, I also noticed how that the jumping is higher, as I thought the game was rigged. Made easier, I would say that the Steam version of The Impossible Game should be made cheaper. A decent $3 could make it alright, and the level editor is not much, since you have to include your own music. But in the end, it's your choice of buying The Impossible Game, not mines, but I would not recommend it at this price and at this difficulty."

(Not very common).And with not much more to say about the game because it's just so simple i must conclude with my verdict.Verdict:The Verdict for my review on The Impossible Game is a solid 6/10.Do i recommend this game? Yes but only to Platform Gamers or people who like a Challenge.With it's good Soundtrack & generally simple & somewhat fun gameplay it does make for a good game to get just for something different & challenging, it's not exactly a game for everybody especially if you're not a platform gamer you won't like this but i do recommend picking it up for it's cheap price & interesting gameplay and if not for that then at least for it's Soundtrack.The PC version of this game doesn't feature anything over the top brilliant over it's Console or Phone version but it does have a much larger Field of View so you can easily see what is coming next before it reaches you unlike in the Console & Mobile versions. So if you've got a large enough screen i'd recommend this version over the others."

Well, it's not IMPOSSIBLE, but it comes close.First the pros. The game has an amazing soundtrack, it's actually the main reason I play this game. Even people who do not normally like techno can't resist the catchy tunes the songs have to offer. Without it, the game would be a jumping square, with nothing else going on. Yes, it greatly enhances the experience. This makes the game pretty darn addicting, but it will test your resolve greatly. To those who think this would be a waste of money, it isn't. The original 5 levels are pretty darn difficult, and they will take some time to master, it depends on how good you are with muscle memory and jumps. Each level gets harder as you go. It will keep you occupied. And even when you finish, there is the level editor. Think about it. Endless levels for one to play. There will always be challenges. You can't just beat the five levels and be done. There will be a whole lot more to beat. And there is this satisfactory feeling of beating a hard level, either the original levels or the user made ones. Not many feelings can replace that.As for the cons, there seem to be a couple, but they aren't bad. As someone who has played both the mobile version and this version, the differences become apparent. Well this wouldn't be a con for some, but the game isn't as hard as the mobile version. The jumps are not as nitpicky. The triple spikes are what make this game a whole lot harder, because you would have to get very close and the jump over it. It felt damn near impossible on the mobile version, but I feel like on this version, when I jump too early, I still make the jump. I can even see the cube scraping the spike. Again, this makes the game easier, which wouldn't be much of a con, but again to those who played the mobile version: it is not as difficult. Also something small to notice is that the jumps are sometime off sync. This isn't really that much of a problem, but it would be cool if it matched the timing of the jumps again. It makes the experience cooler.All in all, the pros outweigh the cons and this makes this game a definite buy for those looking to test their gamer skills."

TIG still fails to disappoint me. While it may differ for you, it's CPU/GPU-friendly, and maintains a minimum of 15fps.The game still retains its really fun challenge, and is great to kill time. Another perk of it is that you can show your friends and see how hard they rage when they get to Chaoz Fantasy or die on the Triple Spikes.The Level Editor adds a new level of replayability to the game, and I'm still looking forward to see what the community has to offer with a new Impossible Level.There are just a few problems I find with this version. The first - this is the version with a wider field of view (think iPad), giving you more time to react (and let's face it - Heaven becomes a tad easier). The Player Cube has a lower gravity effect, meaning those two Triple Spike groups (on the Yellow section on Chaoz Fantasy and the second Blue section on Heaven) become almost impossible (you had about three frames to jump and be safe on any other version - here you only have one).Overall, TIG in general is a great game; the one thing is that it's more expensive on Steam - it's your decision if the Level Editor is worth it.EDIT: Yeah, don't judge me, but I don't really like Geometry Dash, so I won't compare it to The Impossible Game. This one is worth more even though it has fewer levels, trust me."

There is an anoying blur on everything not fixed on the screen. It can make your eyes hurt after playing for a longer period of time. And when you die while in the air, there is a bit of flickering when you respawn. Also, my friend LeBretarm had some problems with the fullscreen option. But these are minor issues.The levels are about 1 minute 30 seconds long which can be a long time if you're new to the game.

You can also create levels with your own music.The game's music can get quite repetitive and the practice mode's music is even worse.

Thank you.The Impossible Game is anything but 'Impossible', and in some of the worst ways. The first of which is that this game isn't actually hard, challenging or difficult. It's artificially Difficult. The levels and mechanics are designed to give you a very small window to correctly execute what's required, often not enough for you to be able to react fast enough on the first try. There is not much actual skill required to beat this game, nor is it challenging, it's just a test of muscle memory. The only real way to play is to keep trying and dying in a level until you can remember what exactly to do. Couple that with the fact that dying sends you completely back to the start of a decently sized static level, you'll only find yourself getting frustrated at the game while slowly trying to get back to where you were to have another shot. If you're getting upset over the game instead of your own lack of skill, there's clearly something wrong.Secondly, the port to PC is pretty bad. I've checked around the Steam Discussions and found mixed results, but there are clearly people experiencing troubles with the game, and there's no fix in sight. I personally experience some of the worst stuttering and motion blur I've ever seen in a game before, I literally have to play the game on the smallest resolution to make it even bearable to play for smaller play sessions, and that's completely dodging how hard it is to actually play the game while trying to focus on such a blurry mess. It's certainly not a problem with my monitor though, as when recording the game, the footage catches both the blur and the stuttering, which you can see in the video posted in the next point.Finally, but most importantly, the game isn't even consistent! By far the worst part about the game is how random the hitboxes for the spikes are. I literally have recorded footage of the cube going half way into a spike and surviving while other times getting kill by the mere edge of the spike. I find it pretty hard to recommend any game with such ridiculously inconsistent hitboxes, especially when spikes are practically half of what this entire game is. Seriously though, I actually have a recording of this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-urtO-0R84In all honesty, it's certainly a nice idea, and I was really hoping it'd be better, but It just didn't come together properly. Short of that though, the controls are tight, and it's undeniably fun to glide through a level nailing everything nicely, but with the game being built around artificial difficulty in such a way that encourages frustration, it's certainly isn't the most fun game you could buy. The best part of this game is easily the music, but that's all downloadable for free on the Newgrounds Audio Portal.If all that doesn't sound too bad, you probably will enjoy the game for what it is, but I'd highly recommend you take your $5 and buy Super Hexagon instead."

On a game like this, where timing is of the utmost importance, lag is unacceptable, especially when the graphics are so simple.  Now, I have a high-powered gaming computer, but really any computer at all should be able to run this game without lag.  I can play the TI-84 graphing calculator port without lag, and that thing has a .015 GHz processor!Now, as far as the game mechanics go, it's fine.  The music is good and energetic, the art style is minimalist, with just lines and gradients, and the gameplay is simple yet enjoyable (if you're at least decent at playing).  But the lag is just unacceptable.  Granted, the lag isn't severe, and I can still play the game, and I've actually gotten quite far, but still.

This is a fun game with levels layouts based off the song that is playing. With 4 main levels and the original level to make 5 I cannot feel like the game lacks in content as it is basically a dollar per level which some may take days to finish if you are not good at the game. The PC edition of this games feels a little sloppy with frequent moments where the levels disappear with the song still playing and the orange cube you play as freaking out sometimes after you die. The worst part is when this happens if you are in full screen it makes it rather hard to close. Besides the glitches and whatnot lies a fun game with great songs and an equally good challenge that can drive some insane. DEFINITELY worth the money."

All you can do is jump. The only thing to aid you is the sound of the music as the soundtrack mostly goes with the course. You'll die again and again, but you'll keep coming back for more because you want to beat that stage, and hear the entire song. You get an amazing feeling of satisfaction when you accomplish it, let me tell you. It's a test of your memory and reflexes. Play to win.The game's length can depend on how good you are, but the level selection is rather short. It's only 5 levels long, and the length of each stage is around 2 minutes. The replay value comes to just simply beating the level. The only other thing you can do is create levels of your own in the level editor. If you like that kind of thing, then by all means, go for it.Overall, The Impossible Game is an addicting, very hard game with a very upbeat soundtrack. If you love challenge and reflex games, then buy this. If that's not your cup of tea, you might not find much enjoyment out of it.7/10"

Unless you want to start spawning flags to bypass this (by entering practise mode), and practise each section by itself, whilst losing the cool music in the process, then you must endure this slog each and every death.I mean, games like Super Hexagon have similar issues, but this is a puzzle platformer. So the level -never changes-. An easy game with randomly generated terrain at least keeps the player awake, but a long puzzle platformer frustrates the beginner, only to bore the intermediate before only finally pleasing the master (who has to make the starting journey once or twice).The music is pretty good though, but the practise mode music is rubbish. Also changing the rhythm on the player by changing the track between practise and 'real' mode is unhelpful at the least.The game is also slightly glitchy (the player doesn't start on the ground after death, and at one point my character just vanished from the field).Really, these games can be enjoyable for a time, but I wouldn't pay money for them (or, at least, again). Find a flash variant of the same thing on Newgrounds or some other Flash game user-submitted portal.And this one isn't particularly 'impossible' or special or even mechanically or graphically better than these Flash games, just long with a limited field of view to force your death many times, until you finally memorise everything.I might pay money for the music though, if it were in standalone form."

However this version has some bugs in it that make it hard to play on my computer, and here they are:When the background colors change, the game's framerate drops, I tried playing a custom level that's provided with the game called Doom and I can't advance very far because the framerate keeps dropping.The game also pauses on me at random points, I keep failing some levels because the game keeps pausing.Occasionally the game will also snap out of focus and the game will pause itself making game progression difficult.Sometimes the cube will go into other spots spontaneously making you fail and start over, happened to me twice in one game sessionThose are the only bugs that I have found so far even though I bought it only yesterday. As the game gets patched, and as the bugs get squished, I will be upating this review, for now it's a 7/10"

Unlike the mobile version where you have to hone your skills and feel achieved once you beat the first level because you know you beat the game through skill and not pure luck. However they changed the fundimental game mechanics (jump distance/height) to make the game ""easier"" for beginners. In the mobil version however, they made the game difficult at the very start by using a smaller jump height and smaller jump distance. Now that the height and length of the jump was increased, all of the countless hours playing the damn mobile version mean nothing. Now you have to play at a completely different rythem counteracting the one that was drilled into your head.

I play on an old-ish macbook with 4 gigs of ram and a pretty lame graphics card. It's not a gaming computer at all, so if you want, just disregard everything I'm about to say and blame my computer, which could be the problem, although I really don't think it should matter for a game this simple.Basically what I think you should know about this game is this: It is a simple but fun game, the music is epic, but the bugs are just TERRIBLE. First of all, the framerate sucks and there is often delay when you try to jump. Along with those, you have a bunch of other annoying things that can happen, and do happen frequently Sometimes when you die the game gets out of sync and the music isn't synced to the course, which is very annoying. The most frequent thing is that almost everytime you die, the cube will lag around for a second before settling at the beginning of the level, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't happen every 15 seconds. Those are two of the most annoying things, but there are plenty of other little bugs and annoyances, which again wouldn't be a big deal, excpet there are so many of them.Overall, I would say get the game and spend the 5 bucks if you think you'll play it enough - I'm glad I did - but be don't get your hopes up too much about the smoothness of the gameplay.Hope this helps!"

The other problem from this game is that it is not Dxtory friendly which sometimes cause the game to crash if played to long while recording and frame rates tend to be unstable when using Dxtory since usually 2D games should be more stable when recording then 3D ones.Overall, This game is good for those who like challenges but not for those who always had a bad day.Anyway, if you guys interested you can watch my gameplay video on the game and see me how frustrated I was playing this game.http://youtu.be/y-9zwapUgYo"

Storyline just approved when i bought this game:LEVEL 1: Fire Aura- ""Very good song""- Died in a block x.x- ""Okay this time im getting serious""- Passed almost everything expect for teh last Triple spike- &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; Retries ;w;- Beated da level.Fire aura wasnt a really hard level but IT WILL for sure make you rage if you dont pay attention to the jumps and the triple spikes, song are amazing, and then later i found Original Level i was confusing in here but it was just a remake of Fire Aura or it was teh Fire aura in other system than PC.Now Chaoz fantasy [One of my favorite song] i though the level is way too easy as♥♥♥♥♥ because i beated the Fire aura i though im okay with other levels, but in the drop, i found myself gravity switched, great im done this level took me like 250 attempts to complete it doe of the 2nd Gravity switch with the FREAKING TRAIN LINE OF TRIPLE SPIKES, that part is the hardest part in this level.Now Heaven... i laughed because it was too easy at the begineer :) and its still easy at the first drop but the song killed me and made me dying, but oh god... the second drop part is THE HARDEST ONE in the entire level, Heaven is also the hardest level i have ever got in this game... it took me 1246 attempts to complete it.. jesus but i finally got it and won the freaking level but warning to ya: Heaven has the most Triple spike and its also signned as HARDEST level, dont play it if you hate to get raged.Phazd... PHAZD is really EASY as Fire aura its kinda like a Version 2 of Fire aura, theres no Gravity switch or Moving blocks effect, worth it10/10 Songs are freaking beast, also WE CAN CREATE LOVOLS YOYOYOYOYOYOOY."

I'm sure you have seen this game from Achievement Hunter/Rage Quit, but the instant I saw it I kew I had to buy it. The trouble was that I didn't have an Xbox.Anyway, to the gameplay: It's rather simple-you're an orange square, with no control over horizontal movement. The game moves to the right for you. The only control you have is to jump, and place checkpoints if you wish. There is one simple goal: get to the end of the level without touching the side of a block, a pit, or a spike.Dispite its simplicity, this game is FIENDISHLY difficult. I am still having a hard time on Fire Aura, the first level. Yet for me, at least, it is addicting as heck. I have gone up to hundreds of attempts and I'm still playing it. And I dare to say that it beats Flappy Bird by a LONGSHOT. Plus, it has an editor to make your own levels. Nothing beats that."
