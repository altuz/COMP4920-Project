Thumbs up or thumbs down?There are good(ish) and bad points to this tarted up version of the 1990s classic.Good(ish):It looks OKIt's full of nostalgiaIt's playable enoughYou can turn your brain off and just playBad:Gameplay (and to my mind graphics) are not as good as the Amiga or Atari ST version. This is not forgiveable in 2014.It's too easyThe ball velocity has been slowed downClumsy animationSo why am I still playing it? Because my Amiga is long dead and as bad a version as this is, it's still as close to the original as I'm going to get.Marginal thumbs up 5/10"

It will ruin your memories.This is a terrible ""HD"" remake of the game. It is actually lacking in some features the original had, like the manager mode. What it also is lacking is any difficulty at all, you will easily steamroll every team in the first two seasons, except when you suddenly play a team that is completely maxed out when you still have very low stats.What this game also lacks is any decent graphics. Sure, they are ""HD"", even though you only get to choose from 4 basic resolutions. Sorry laptop users. But they look terrible. Bitmap Brothers games were known for their slick, stylish graphics and this game almost seems to make a mockery out of that. To add insult to injury the game is locked at 29 FPS, making it difficult for me to play for any length of time due to eye-strain (as if the graphics weren't insulting my eyes enough already).Then finally you would probably expect an HD remake to have online multiplayer. Nope... Sorry guys. All this remake offers over the original is the higher resolution/horrible design graphics. That's it. No Manager mode, no online multiplayer, no challenge, no point in buying this. Oh did I mention the game crashing, save file corruption, playing teams with identical outfits to yours making it impossible to tell them apart (and then crashing after the match), terrible intro ""video"", lack of the awesome original soundtrack...I could go on but this should really be enough for you to make your mind up. Avoid like the plague."

Never getting tired of the bone crunching tackles or the ""Ice cream"" yells. Always coming so close to winning the league and then getting stomped on by that one team. After a few failed comebacks it's nice to see someone sticking to the orginal formula but giving it a bit of polish. The addition of a 10 year career mode is a welcome addition. The new teams are brutal at first but they are beatable. It's also nice to be able to play in new arenas but somehow I can't help but be drawn back to those original steel coloured floors.They left out some stuff from the first one if memory serves, like you could bribe a match offical to give you more time on the pitch. I'm kind of sad they replaced some of the artwork too.Sadly the people who made this game are no longer around. To the Bitmap Brothers.

It's higher resolution, sure, but all nuance of the original is lost, sprites look comical, pitches ugly and it's even hard to tell where the goalmouth starts and ends. Instead of starting with a team that looks like a bunch of nerds your starting team are now randomly cybernetically enhanced. All 'New Art' motivation for purchasing star players is lost. All players are now a mish-mash of badly redrawn features from original characters. If you enjoy looking at clunky photo-fit faces with glued-on moustaches and noses that line up with mouths perhaps one in ten times (once you see this you can't unsee it), you're in for a real treat.Graphics aside, the game is still fairly solid. The on-pitch gameplay is basically just a port of the original with no attempts made to revamp. Game mode differs in a few respects, some good, some bad, but nothing is going to make up for the god awful look of the thing.If there was an option to use original graphics I'd probably be able to recommend this. As-is it's really just a curio for fervent fans of the original. Something to pass the time, to agonise over how what could have been and to highlight just how incredible the original really was."

Lets go back to yonder days when I was much much younger than I am now, the mid 90s (Speedball came out in 1988 and 1990 (2) but was re-released for 95/98 in a multipack) and I remember spending many an hour running around with my cyberpunk steroidal war bears beating up the enemy for ball possession and winning the majority of my games purely by knocking out enemy team members (which gives you as many points as scoring a goal might I add) and screaming at my goal keeper to stop being a poof. Ahhh, good times.Fast forward to today and Speedball 2 HD is a re-release of the 1988 cult classic set in the future of a bloodbowl sport which is a combination of lacrosse, american football and cage fighting. It's exactly like the original (as far as I can remember) and I have already spent a few hours knocking out the enemy and scoring obscene goals. It's such a good remake it has all of it's warts and boils with the buggy player swapping whenever the ball is perfectly between three of your players causing it to bounce all over the place. But all that is forgotten when you get your players hip dancing and kneesliding from scoring or knocking out the enemy players.Brutality aside, this is classic game that is challenging, requires a little thought on how you move around and a lot of keyboards from smashing the spacebar. The challenging enemy players can range from ""screwdrivers in their heads"" stupid to ""holy hell I haven't even touched the ball and it's already half time"". Great to pick up for a quick laugh then put back down. I can imagine friendships being broken when this game is played on the LAN!"

Always seemed too major a penalty and this version has taken it up another notch. Disappointing but I'm finding I'm injuring my opposition much more than they're injuring me anyway.The inclusion of online multiplayer would have made me a very happy fan but can't have everything I guess.

If you have never played the Sega Genesis version, then you will love this game, but for those that loved the genesis version, you will most likely not care for this game.Overall, Speedball 2 HD is fun. It's a mix between rugby and handball, with a science fiction futuristic twist. There are powerups, warp tunnels, and action items, along with hard hitting, good passing, and goal scoring. The objective of this game is to outscore you opponent. You can score by knocking out a player, hitting stars on the sideboard, hitting 1 of 2 circle orbs in the center of the arena, or get it in the opponent's goal. Each scoring method has its own point value, and the strategy is to score points as quickly and often as possible. The game is action packed, and very fun.My main gripe is the differences between the classic Sega version, and this one. While the Steam version has better graphics, more features, better stats, and achievements, the Sega version just dominated it in gameplay. Sega's version was really fast (most likely due to Sega's blast processing ability lol)! The camera view was more zoomed in, so it appeared to move quickly. Throws were longer, there was less hitting and more agility needed, players didn't always fall down in one hit, and there were more stressful and exciting situations that made you grab your controller tightly. Most games were usually close, with scores only 10-20 points different from each other. In the Steam version, I can easily beat the computer by over 100 points in a game. I usually score 40-70 points in 45 seconds, and once that happens, I know they aren't going to come back.Personally, I feel that the original price is much too high for this game, but if you can grab it on sale, it's fun for anyone, Speedball fan or not."

,Recommended,251690,7999146,"Posted: 10 December, 2013",all,Lukozer,"I was a huge fan of the classic Amiga original, so when i first heard about this i was immediately enthralled. A couple of days later a friend of mine had bought it and told me that it had some niggles that meant it wasn't as good as the Amiga version, but still a good game. Since it's only £5.50 (i'd payed £25 for the Amiga original in 1991!) i figured what the hell, i'll give it a go.I have to say he was right, it does have some niggles that mean it's not as good as the original Amiga version, but it is still a good game and very enjoyable. Fans of the original will be pleased to hear it plays near identically, with the transfer market, gym and the all important match play itself all faithfully reproduced. Graphically i don't think it compares to the Amiga version though and while many of the sounds have been ported over from the original, some additional sound in the form of in-game music feels out of place. Thankfully said music can be turned off.In the match play, the ball feels rather heavy and slow, so doesn't travel very far when thrown. But where the match play compares particularly unfavourably to the Amiga original is with injuries. In the original these were somewhat rare, as even the weakest players were still somewhat strong, but here you will find injuries to opposing players are rather easy to dish out and you'll average at least 3 per game. If you get more, they can't bring on a substitute and so with one or more players short they become a bit too easy to beat. That's not to say the computer teams are a walkover, they certainly aren't, and once they have a sniff of a goal they've as good as scored. So the computer is at least competative, which is a good thing since multiplayer consists of LAN play only, there is no online multiplayer at all. Hopefully this will be addressed in the future as this game is just crying out for that feature.My final niggle is the resolution, with 1920x1200 being the maximum supported, so if you playing at a resolution higher than that (as i am) you'll have to make do. With 1920x1080 and 1920x1200 now being pretty much mainstream resolutions for gamers, this game really should support at least up to 2560x1600.However, those are the only issues i've encountered with this game. Everything else is very good and make the game extremely enjoyable, particularly for those of us who played and loved the classic Amiga game. Highly recommended."

I was really disapointed to see that there is no ability to play as the manager and initially gave this a big thumbs down. The manager mode may be missing but there is at least some more content regards leagues/cups for when you play single player mode. I think the difficulty could do with tweaking though as it's insanely easy in the leagues and insanely difficult in the cups until later on (even though I get that this is kind of on purpose, it needs a tweak to keep things interesting). That said, I got this one sale and although there are a tone of things that could be done to this game to improve it, I've had some fun with it. Since I paid I think 1-2 Euro for it, for that money I'll give it a thumbs up.Expect to find things you don't like about this game but it can be a bit of fun if you are ok with playing solo as there is no online multiplayer functionality."

Try doing anything in this game with a gamepad and you'll end up doing a lot of things you didn't mean to do.It seems as though they have changed the gameplay for the worse. It's way too easy to win, which is partly thanks to a horrible AI. Also, I had the feeling that my players who should have been knocked out just kept going regardless.The user interface is a mess. The gym functions are particularly annoying. Selected players' faces will be highlighted, but very subtly so, so you need to be extra careful not to overtrain. I didn't see any skill values in numbers, as well.The music doesn't cut it, neither do the sound effects.

Thats worth some sort of award considering that the original was released nearly 15 years ago. Other thing is the sticky ball, sometimes teleporting to a player close by. Also, in addition to the sticky ball, I think the ball itself is acting weird and feeling of the ball moving around the game area is worse than in the original. Also I noticed the ball sometimes going through a player, pretty annoying. Other weird things happening, this has happened only with goalie, when trying to charge right, towards the ball, the goalie charged left, leaving the goal wide open.Even with all this said I guess I'll have to recommend, it's a nice game if you are tired of the flash-version of original. Don't know if it because of that I've played that constantly or just that the game is bit too easy in the beginning, I now have 8 matches played, including the cup-matches in the beginning, and I've won every match so far.Little less annoying is that there is no side change on half time and the injuries, the game is insta-stopped on injury. In the original you could play for 2-3 seconds, so incase goalie injured, you still had time to make a goal on top of that. Also double injuries happened, now its quite hard, unless you tackle 2 guys with minimum health at once.As a conclusion, the game feels bit strange and different than the original in the beginning, but after you get used to it, the career mode and stuff like that not in the original are the reasons for recommendation."

What was acceptable in 1990 feels below average today.True to the name the game is in HD and you won't see any pixelated gfx, however the original game used a 32 colours palette with subtle shade and nuance to great effects, this release make a very poor use of the extended palette available and the new gfx have lost the famous Bitmap Brothers ""metalic look"".During the match the game works correctly, and you can have some fun for a while, but there are small bugs here or there.  For example you can win all your league matchs by a comfortable margin but from time to time your league ranking is n't properly updated to reflect your performances. This is a serious issue in carrer mode, as there is a good chance that over the 10 seasons career one of your season will be bugged.A few modes have been added but overal there is a lack of attention to details. The gameplay is very unbalanced as most game are either too hard (sometimes) or too easy (often).There is controller support for Player 1 but not for player 2 :((, moreover there is only local multiplayer.There are 20 peoples listed in the credits including 5 programmers and 5 for QA, but the result is very disapointing, and the lack of infos and support is a shame.Certainly not worth the full price, some single player value may make it worth it on sale."

Game mechanics, team names, even player's faces are the same. The only difference that I noticed is that when you injure an opponent the game stops immediately and you score some points. In the old Atari version there was a few seconds delay, which if you were fast enough allowed for multiple injuries in the same action. A detail, but I missed destroying the goal keeper while scoring a goal.If you mastered the old game, it will be easy to rack-up victories. The game suffers from the same uneven difficulty than it's predecessor. I only played the career mode (10 seasons), and it was a bit boring toward the end. Once you dominate the League, other teams are easily crushed, with scores like 400-0. It's a bit annoying that you have to go through 7 games againsth these weak ennemies to gain access the cup where the real competittiors. The dev could have tried to improve this aspect of the game.I spent countless hours on SB2 many years ago. It was fun to replay a good copy with modern graphics."
