The largest amount of influence you have is to decide what gear you buy at the start of the game, after that a Choose Your Own Adventure novel allows more player agency. You get to decide whether to try to shoot before engaging in melee with enemies. That's the full sum of your available decisions in at least 90% of the average game.I suppose if you are really bored it might be worth it at 50% off. Do not buy this expecting the Games Workshop magic, though. This is one of their earliest offerings and it shows."

And into this, the Chainsaw Warrior, destined to bear the Laser Lance slung over a cybernetic shoulder. It is I, this reviewer, who alone can tell you of his suicide mission. Let me tell you of the minutes of heroic sacrifice.""Chainsaw Warrior was an old board game by Games Workshop, created in 1987. This version is a direct adaptation of that game. For this reason, it may appear overly simplistic for many computer gamers.Beings from another dimension threaten to destroy New York and you, a cybernetically enhanced elite warrior (think 6 Million Dollar man meets Snake Plissken) have 60 minutes to get in the quarantine zone, fight your way through zombies and mutants and reach the big bad ""Darkness"" and hope you'll be able to kill it.""Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man. The Chainsaw Warrior will be that man. Better than he was before. Better... stronger... faster.""You roll 6-sided dice to create your chainsaw warrior and pick your starting equipment.How many dice you roll depends on which one of the three difficulty levels you choose. While all have the potential for the same stats, on higher difficulties these are more random.Equipment is either chosen freely on Easy or blindly on higher difficulties.""New York, 2023: The entire city is on the brink of destruction. The old municpal buildings' staircases are mined. The elevators are booby trapped. And an apoclyptic cult has everything locked down. They think.Based on the board game by Stephen Hand, Auroch Digital's Chainsaw Warrior:One man must go in where no man stands a chance to ever get out. And if he fails his mission, our nightmare has just begun.""The game comprises of you turning over cards from a deck, each card being one room you search. Once the first 54 card deck is done, you proceed to the second one which includes Darkness. But the clock is ticking: each turn of a card, each round of combat, each other action are 30 seconds and there are 108 cards to turn. So you have to move through the building as fast as possible, conserving ammo and trying not to die of radiation or poison or zombie bites. In the end, when you finally get to Darkness, it may all come down to one stupidly lucky roll of double sixes. But that is what suicide missions with only a remote chance of success are all about.""So, did the Chainsaw Warrior banish the evil Darkness to its home dimension. And having no further concern, he returned to his hole-in-tjhe-wall appartment. Many cans of beer did the Chainsaw Warrior drink, trying to numb the memories. Yet honor and glory were heaped upon his name and, in time, he was called to save the world once more... And this story shall also be told."""

That's how sad I am...er, WAS (I would never do anything like that nowadays, except for innumerable recent games of Arkham Horror by myself...but apart from that, NEVER)!!This is the first time I've tried one of these literal board game conversions, and I must say I do find it all a bit odd as a concept, but that aside this is about as successful as something like this could have ever been. And I've just spent a solid few hours trying to conquer all three difficulty levels, so there's obviously something a bit compelling about it all. That said, I suspect there's a not a great deal of replayability once one has gained all three - count 'em, THREE - Achievements, and I'm already two down, so how much this is worth the measly five buck asking price is up to you.My advice would be to wait til it's on sale, and then the heck with it...how much playing time do you expect for two or three dollars? Skyrim won't be that cheap any time in the next decade, so by all means, if you're as big a nerd as me, and want a taste of what we old ♥♥♥♥ers used to play BEFORE the Playstation 1 even existed, then it's surely worthwhile as a curiosity piece if nothing else. By the time I conquer all three difficulties I probably will have wasted five hours of my precious life, so that's about a buck an hour. Only the cheapest of cheapskates can balk at that kinda logic, surely...Verdict: 8/10."

,Not Recommended,251710,9874900,"Posted: 19 April, 2014",all,𝔩𝔞𝔫𝔡𝔴𝔥𝔞𝔩𝔢,"Single player card game where you dig through two 54 card decks on a time limit to defeat the very uniquely named big bad, ""Darkness"". Most card games have enough randomization because of the shuffling of cards, luck of the draw, and so forth, but for some reason Chainsaw Warrior feels the need to add die rolls to almost every action, including stats during character creation. On Hard difficulty the game can be over before its even begun because of bad die rolls for stats or bad card draws for equipment (because you're only allowed to chose catagory, not specific items). [Quick anecdote: Mark Rosewater at WotC noted that the main reason the Star Wars CCG failed was because fans hated having to roll dice for everything in a card game.]Even if you perfectly pick your loadout and get decent stats, many cards in the play decks have incredibly gamebreaking abilities. For example, one card makes you reshuffle all the cards in the deck and start over, another will break your sole win condition weapon, and another will make you lose several turns (randomly decided how many, of course). The most frustrating part is these cards might as well say ""You Lose!""... but they just tease you into playing an unwinnable game. Many cards also have stat debuffs (zombie venom or radiation) that stack over time and are difficult to remove, providing yet another way for you to lose the game.Of course, being a cheap, direct iOS port also brings a slew of other issues. A touch screen interface with gigantic oversized buttons, ""click-click-click to play"" gameplay, and worst of all, savescumming. The decks are shuffled at the start of the game and are never reshuffled unless you trigger a certain trap. While this is realistic, it makes for bad video game gameplay. To put it simply, you can save the game every card and reload if you make a huge mistake or if you want to redo a fight (even the end boss!). This removed all of the challenge and distilled the game down into simple die rolls and restarts. While it is ignorable, you will still probably restart the game when you pull one of the previously mentioned ""almost game-ending"" cards.Chainsaw Warrior was probably a lot more fun to play sitting on the couch on a weekend afternoon but is a huge headache in its poorly ported video game form. Only recommended for nostalgic value or for owners of the original game."

Survive long enough and oppose all kinds of enemies and obstacles in order to defeat the final boss. The game itself is neatly presented and it looks quite good at first, especially for a solitaire board game.Unfortunately the nature of the game is very dependant on random number generation, from the character creation to the combat rolls. Which kind of makes it extremely random and luck dependant rather than skill and careful planning. Furthermore your options as a player are severely limited. Sometimes you will have to manage your inventory and what kind of items you want to take or use but overall you will just throw dice over and over. Each encounter is resolved by dice rolls and it's absolutely not spectecular nor interesting. At some point you are just so bored because it is not a very involving process. Also the actual animations are so minimal, that you won't get any excitement out of it.Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of board games and I do not mind minimal graphical presentation but this game is shallow and very boring at best. There is nothing that makes you want to come back, perhaps just if you ownd the original game as a kid and feel nostalgic towards it."

You're in luck, because now it's on Steam and mobile devices as a video game! It's brutally hard, so much so that while doing research for this review, I read that a dude who started playing this game in 1987 never got so much as a single win from the game in over 25 years. He became MEGA-PUA, Godzilla's latest nemesis. Losing streaks like these are a result of dice-based mechanics combined with card-based ♥♥♥♥ery, which results in this game being a big ol' pile of NERD GAMBLING. However, I thoroughly enjoy this because it is possible to get around those disadvantages and find a way to outwit and cleave through enemies like nothing, so it is possible to have a fighting chance. I enjoyed it, but I don't feel I'm going to enjoy it all that longer. But it's cheap and you can throw on some music from Thomas Barrandon in the background to enhance the experience."

Each drawing of a card will subtract 30 seconds from the timer. It's a simple mechanic that's easy to grasp and makes for some truly random game sessions. Controls are simple, sounds and graphics are passable, and the UI presents everything on screen that is needed in a clear and easy to read format.Staying true to the original , it can be quite challenging and depending on the luck of the draw, you could be restarting within the first few minutes.

,Recommended,251710,13177251,"Posted: 30 November, 2014",all,[FTG] Becky,"A Games Workshop fan of the 1980's will probably remember this. I however was neither of these. In fact it wasn't until the Exploration Sale (2014), that I found this game whilst browsing the usual Warhammer 40k games and came across this little gem. Since I'm neither a child of the 80's, nor was I a Games Workshop fan, I believe I can provide a fresh, unbiased review of this game. So please bear with me.First off, this game is completely about the luck of the roll. You roll for everything in this game, and I love it! You begin the game with a comic strip intro, and then you begin the game. You have to roll d6's to get your stats. There are no RPG ""select this stat?"" After you have rolled for your stats, you get some basic points that you can use to aquire weapons, HTH (Hand To Hand) weapons, and or clothing. But you must keep in mind you have a very, and I do mean very, limited amount of points, which usually for me, winds up being one gun, one HTH weapon, and that is all.After all this prep you begin the game full. You are thrust into New York with a background picture, on your left are cards, to your right, your actions. You turn a card face up, and then you proceed from there. Once you turn it face up, if it is an enemy, you must roll the d6, depending on what you chose. As a short example. Say you turn over a card and it is a zombie, you select say HTH, once done, a combat roll will happen and based on your starting stats, you must equal or beat a certain roll. Or conversely, you can use your weapon, say a rifle. If you roll badly though, you can and will miss and as a last resort, you will be forced into HTH or even made to try and escape the threat.You go through the apartment blocks, and roll your way to victory! But not all the cards are of course enemies, you have some empty room cards, to which you must roll your d6's to see if anything lurks around the corner. You can get item cards, medical pack cards etc. But the majority of what you will be doing is rolling against the cards that are enemies. Once you have a chance to escape a building, you must roll through some more cards to make it out alive. Which if like me, you have been left with nothing but your HTH weapon, can be very tense.To make it to the end you need good rolls, and you need to watch your bottom bar which includes a venom and radiation meter. If either fill up, it doesn't look hopeful for you. Amongst the threats lurking behind each card backing, is the ever present timer. Everything you do takes time. Be it reloading a weapon. Using an item. And such. Once it becomes night, your stats may go down and it may just get that bit extra harder. As if it wasn't hard enough!I'd recommend this game based on it's original HARD difficulty alone as it is brutal and who knows if you will get the rolls you need. If you're a die fan, then sadly this game only uses d6 dices. The game has the mentallity for just ""one more roll, I just need one more good roll!""You will be pulling your hair out with bad rolls."

Not because Auroch Digital have done a bad job (they've done a faithful conversion) but rather that the original card/board game it was based on was brutally hard and would frequently screw you over with dice rolls and bad card draws.On the other hand, as I am an owner of the original Chainsaw Warrior game (and the extra equipment cards from White Dwarf magazine) from way back when it was released in 1987 I was always going to like this game. The digital version of the game allows me to play it much quicker.The Game:You take on the title role of the Chainsaw Warrior, fighting your way through a haunted building in New York filled with Zombies, Chaos Cultists, Mutant creatures, Rats and traps to the final boss. Your ultimate aim is to defeat Darkness, an evil being from another dimension who is intent on destroying you, the city and everyone in it because reasons. Mwuhahahaha! (cue spooky music)Play is basically flipping through a card draw pile and dealing with the various encounters along the way. You are armed with weapons & equipment to help you beat the enemies & hazards blocking your path to Darkness. What gear you choose at the start is critical (pick the Chainsaw!), but more often than not the evil dice will defeat you long before you reach the final boss.The Good:+ destroy Zombies with a Chainsaw+ plays just like the original game+ quick easy setup & play since you don't have to track dice rolls, counters & cards yourself+ comic book style card art & themed interface icons from the original+ atmospheric music and combat effects+ reasonably priced+ good replayabilityThe Bad:- plays just like the original game- dice rolls will be cruel- you may fail due to a bad draw- not especially deep- your decisions, while important, will often be trumped by random chanceThe odd:- only some of the optional equipment cards from ""Life & Death & An American Chainsaw"" are in the game (an odd decision)- sadly the great Brett Ewins artwork from the original box & comic is not used (copyright issues I guess)In Summary:Buy it if you owned (or wanted to own) the original and loved itBuy it if you want to play a unique piece of 1980's Role play gaming historyBuy it if despatching Zombies with a Chainsaw appeals to youAvoid it if you hated the original since this is just the sameAvoid it if losing often to an unlucky dice roll sends you into a frothing rageBuy it if it's ever on saleGift it to friends who like Zombie games and movies"

The game itself plays out like a randomized card-game version of a rogue-like. I've seen many complaints about the unfairness of this game, due to its randomized nature and all, but I can't help but feel it's an unfair assumption to assume that just because it's a card game that this game is inherently intended to be a purely strategic experience. What it is at its core, is a quick-playing ride into hell.Winning is a rarity - I haven't even won one game myself, but I still like to come back to it for a quick playthrough now and then, because it's easy to learn and fun to experiment with. It's nothing more than quick romps through bloodshed and randomized weaponry, but it doesn't pretend to be more than that either. That, and although its randomized nature - including randomizing the player's selection of weapons and items - may make it seem as though there isn't any room for strategy at all, the game does indeed have strategy in the same way most gambling games do. You're hedging your bets. Betting that larger firepower won't be necessary, betting that the monster around the bend WON'T be a radioactive sludge beast, betting you can open that door without wasting bullets and thus saving precious extra in-game time to complete your mission.You'll come close, it might be painful.

If yes then you will enjoy Chainsaw Warrior for what it is. If you were expecting anything more then you won't find it here.The game involves creating a character via the use of dice and a selection of equipment cards. After that you'll go into the main game which has you clicking through a deck of cards to see what random events you come across, which can be traps, monsters, secret passages etc. At each event you can select between a couple of choices like using a item or attacking. Everything you do is delivered through the dice.The presentation is okay. The art is mostly from the card game I guess, animations are basic and sound assets aren't anything special, the intro comic is quite neat though. But to me it feels so much more could've been done with this setting, like having the Warrior and Mutants visually on the screen and having them fight it out etc.I bought the game during a sale for a couple of dollars which to me feels like the right price for this game. The game is ok but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone except to people who want a digital version of the card game.

All relevant dies are resolved with 1-3d6, there are several different items which allow bypassing traps or weapons which do different amount of damage to different groups of enemies. Additionally all weapons ecxept melee weapons have limited ammo and should only be used when necessary to conserve the very rare ammo pickups.

For me, that's the fun in it, trying to bounce back from an already bad situation. Even though the odds are stacked against you, there are plenty of goodies and items to help you along your way. All items offer different perks and stat boosts, allowing you to approach the game in a few different ways. Sporting three difficulty modes, it helps oneself get used to how the game works and allows for you to experiment with weapon and item combinations.Its a simple game at its core, but it has excellent replayability due to its hard difficulty curve and random encounters/events.

My answer would be yes, as despite the random, luck based nature of the game, and its brutal difficulty, there is some enjoyment to be had here. It's based on a single-player card and dice game from the 1980s. I hadn't heard of it until the release of this version. I find it odd that it is single player as I can see the premise working well with multiple people, but I digress.In this game, you choose a difficulty, and roll dice for your stats. Depending on your difficulty, you'll roll 1-3 dice and take various values, explained in game for your stats. Then you roll for so many equipment points, and you decide what type of equipment to take with you on your journey. From there, it comes down to what cards you draw and what equipment you have.Your goal is to get through one deck of 54 cards, and then through a second deck until you find ""Darkness"", the ultimate evil looking to destroy the city. Oh, and you only have one hour to do this. Every time you draw a card or engage in combat you lose 30 seconds, and you can lose time for other reasons as well. If you run out of time, well, that's it, you lose.This game takes pleasure in screwing you, in various ways. For instance, it's entirely possible that the only weapon that can defeat the final boss, The Laser Lance, can be destroyed during the course of your game, or you can run out of ammo for it, and have to start a deck all over to get a new one. You can be forced to start over due to running into a giant chasm, running into a locked door without a way to open/break it, etcetera.Despite this frustration, there is enjoyment to be had here, and for $5.00, you can't really go wrong."

And yet, somehow, Chainsaw Warrior is not quite the be-all-end-all of gaming experiences I hoped it would be. Even so, it's still more enjoyable than any other sci-fi horror Solitaire game on the market. In this PC port of a one-player card game from Games Workshops, you play as the eponymous CHAINSAW WARRIOR, a cybernetically-enhanced combat veteran called back in for one more job - to save New York from a teeming horde of extra-dimensional monstroids led by the entity known only as DARKNESS. After a bit of preliminary character creation (which you have almost no say in), you are sent out into the urban disaster zone to murder your way to the top, hopefully with enough equipment remaining that you can take down the big galoot at the end and save New York from devastation.The game plays out simply, and although it's highly dependent on luck, there's enough strategy and decision making involved to keep it interesting. After character creation, you head out into the city and are given one hour (120 turns) to plow through the two decks of encounter cards. Although there are some helpful encounters out there (empty rooms, ammo dumps, or short cuts if you're really lucky), most encounters are monsters or traps. Each encounter is likely to injure, poison, irradiate, or simply delay you, any of which will eventually kill you, so it's in your best interests to rush through encounters as quickly as you can. Actually clearing out both decks is next to impossible, but fortunately you (probably) won't have to. The final boss, DARKNESS, is shuffled randomly into the second deck, so you might only need to draw a single card from it to face him... or you might plow through all but one card and die, having performed a Herculean feat but still losing anyway.Which brings me to the fact that this game is just absurdly unfair. No matter how skilled you are, six-sided dice are fickle things. One bad roll against a monster capable of killing you in a single hit will just end your game. The last boss can only be killed with two particular items, and they can be destroyed or run out of ammo along the way. An early encounter with a monster that reduces your stats permanently can hamstring an otherwise promising hero. Heck, just rolling awful stats in the very beginning, or getting lousy randomly selected equipment, can ruin your chances of victory before you even set foot into the battlefield. It's all aggravating, and the character generation process is drawn out more than it needs to be, and there's no quick reset option, and aaaaugh i hate you i hate you i hate chainsaw warrior diiiiiiie....But honestly, winning isn't everything. There's something satisfying about the unpredictable generosity of dice rolls, very much along the lines of rolling a nat 20 and wresting victory from the jaws of defeat. As you play, you learn what threats you'll encounter, how the various items can compensate for your lousy stat rolls, and when it's justifiable to pull out your big guns and waste your precious, precious ammo. And on top of all that, the art style and general aesthetics are just the right kind of schlock 80's cyberpunk crap I adore, mixing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoonery with the occasional spot of authentically disturbing monster design... Just try to ignore the painfully bad voice-acting in the opening cut scene. I'm not about to call this a good game exactly, but it's certainly fun for a while, and the price tag is very easy on the wallet."

In the worst case I would get a few steam trading cards and kill some time.In this game you take the role of a soldier whose job is to save the city. You have a limited amount of gear and a mere 60 minutes to fight your way through two decks worth of monsters and traps before using your Laser Lance (or implosion vest) to destroy “The Darkness”.The game is very unforgiving and you should expect to lose. It is strongly recommended that you start with easy mode, the game is brutal enough that you will still need to fight tooth and nail for victory. Though the mechanics are mind-numbingly simple, the pressure of saving the world in “60 minutes” was surprisingly intense. Perhaps I just had the right mindset, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.If you haven’t already, watch the official trailer on the store page. It shows you exactly what to expect. The rules and interface of the game are most at home on a tablet, it makes no use of desktop capabilities. In fact, unless you want the steam cards, you should buy the tablet version instead. To those who haven’t watched the trailer, you click to turn over cards, you click to choose an action, you click next and then repeat the process.Though the game is largely mindless clicking with everything determined by dice rolls there is an element of strategy. You have a limited amount of time and resources to defeat The Darkness. Do you shoot now knowing you won’t have enough ammo to shoot through the next door you encounter? Do you run or hide? Do you charge head on with a chainsaw? Do you take the secret passage to travel faster but possibly miss out on finding supplies? There are lots of little choices which influence the game.To enjoy the game you need to overlook some glaring flaws. As previously mentioned everything is random, even the equipment you start with. You may need to restart several times just to have a character with a fighting chance. There are also encounters which destroy equipment making the game even more unwinnable. To top it off there are the slimes which can kill you with one lucky roll.Despite these flaws I am thoroughly enjoying the game and intend to play until I complete all the achievements. Its an excellent time killer and you can save and quit whenever you want. I don’t really think its worth $5, but its certainly worth getting on sale."

Second of all, it's a 2014 now.Game developers had not so many options to make it nice to old fans and new-coming players (Should I mention fresh digitalizers like Space Hulk and Talisman or should I search for something older?). At least they can make user interface perfect, while you are not able to change or improve game mechanics. Why I can not turn ""intro"" comics OFF by default? Why the hell all three active areas (Cards deck, HTH-Shoot-da-Whoop and Roll buttons, Continue button) are in three different corners of the screen? Why asking always for something, that's present in single (weapon for Hth, for example). Why always Rolling character in beggining with SO many dumb button press? There is a rule of thumb: program should wait for user interaction IF and ONLY IF user can change the state of program. Here you have to press 7 times some ""skip""-like button, just to see numbers appear on the screen. Hell, thanks, but no.On the one hand, game mechanics are pure random in nature: ""adventure map"" - shuffled card deck, combat - dice based. You'll be shouting on your PC :D for sure.On the other hand, game is hard to play and has a ""moment of choice"", moreover game will always punish you for mistake. You are not only skipping turns, waiting for some ""random"" output and lucky end. You have enough possibilities to change outcome, though they are limited.The original game lacks of ""horizontal balance"": most of ingame items (cloth, weapon, device) can be separed on usefull in 100%  cases and useless in 100% cases. That's bad. Another problem is small amount of such items at all.With all that said: it was fun to play. Please read AGAIN the total score I put in header for this game.

This number is then modified by your character stats, by various equipment cards in your character's possession, or simply by having a ""counter"" card to the given event. Some cards also allow swift progress through the game or, quite likely, they do exact opposite by putting obstacles in the way.This formula isn't necessarily bad but in Chainsaw Warrior it is unfortunately the case. The game system is unreasonably punishing partly by its randomness and by some of the cards being simply too ""difficult"" to actually make the game fun. The fact that most of the game is also randomly resolved pretty much deprives it of any player agency, making it more or less a game of craps than an actual narrative game.For example, to complete the game, you need to clear two decks of 54 cards within an ""hour"" (each action event takes 30 seconds off of that clock soo... 120 ""moves"" to clear 108 cards), however in between those two decks there are numerous cards which will set you back to start, enemies that will kill you in 1 hit (and can't be hurt by anything but specific equipment, which, incidentally, you only acquire randomly), enemies that will steal equipment without you being able to counter it and the list goes on.The most ""fun"" I've had with this game so far is observing the smalle peice of ""game design history"" the game represents (mind the game rules were developed in the mid 80') and generally laughing at the complete unfairness of the game system.All in all, this game is a game the same way blackjack or roulette is a game - it might be fun for some people, but it takes a certain mindset to enjoy this kind of title.If you are into harshly punishing games, where you have very little impact on the gameplay, this might be for you. Otherwise I'd recommend to steer clear of it and enjoy the game on Let's Plays or similar, as that pretty much will give you the whole experience, without you having to pay for it."

It doesn't matter what equipment you pick. It doesn't matter whether you flee or fight, or even if you shoot at an enemy or try to melee them. EVERY action requires rolling dice, every time you fight an enemy requires rolling dice from you both.This might make sense were it not for the fact that even your base stats and equipment are, for some utterly nonsensical reason, decided by dice rolls. These stats then impact EVERY dice roll.Instead of creating variation in gameplay, this usually just cripples you or (much more rarely) makes you stupidly overpowered from the get-go. It also makes zero sense. I'm meant to be some sort of ultra-badass cyborg who's humanity's last hope against a hellish invasion...so why do I have a Marksmanship score of ZERO and Hand-To-Hand of 3?This meant I didn't land a single shot with my gun for the whole game and even the lowliest of zombies was almost impossible for me to beat in close combat. In effect, the game was 100% unwinnable before I'd even left the character creation dicerolls. And I'm supposed to be the best soldier in the world? A blind badger is more dangerous than the Chainsaw Warrior.Add to this some utterly BS event cards for a very unenjoyable experience. There is a ""Chasm"" event that pops up and simply tells you that you have to re-do ALL previous encounters (up to FIFTY). WTF?!This is essentially an instant game over, because it means you have to take ""25 minutes"" off your ""60 minute"" timer (each turn is 30 seconds) and fight about 40 monsters all over again. Other events break your vital equipment and basically ruin your game straight up too.And the enemies. My God, the enemy design is just crazy. The lowliest zombies poison you if they hit you even once, and this builds up constantly for the rest of the game. Mutants have massive defence scores and give you radiation damage JUST BY APPEARING (they don't even have to attack you, again WTF) and The Meat Machine enemy is almost impossible to hit AND permanently damages your combat stats every time it hits you.This means the Meat Machine turns up, you miss shooting it, you miss melee (even with good stats), and then it hits you and damages your stats for the rest of the game. Then you try to flee, but can't because of damaged stats, and it hits you again. Then your stats are so low you can't even fight it at all and it literally gets free hits on you. The game ACTUALLY SAYS: ""You cannot fight this enemy, your stats are too low, lol."" INSTANT GAME OVER.These enemies can turn up on any turn. So you can get a Meat Machine turn 1 and lose immediately. Or Turn 60...and lose immediately.Basically imagine you took a dice game, gave it tons of drugs until it was a giggling irrational wreck with a severe sadism complex. Then roll 20 d6 dice simultaneously and subtract all of them from each other for no reason. You then have a game that makes as much sense as Chainsaw Warrior."

The game is heavily reliant on roll checks to defeat encounters, though there is a little strategy in the different weapons and equipment items you choose in the very beginning.  Beginning stats are also randomzied via die rolls, so there's no class selection or anything of the kind.  You can make your roll checks easier by choosing the easier difficulty setting, though Darkness (the final boss) will still have his way with you unless you're very lucky.  I think he could be made easier on the ""easy"" difficulty setting, personally.

Read the store page to discover the backstory to the game, though it's basically Escape From New York with zombies.The majority of the gameplay is die-rolling (it's nice to know my luck sucks as hard rolling virtually), however there are opportunities to risk/reward weapons, items, maximize attributes and to factor in how far along the player is in the run.The UI is very easy to understand; the art on the cards is nice and stylized -- I cannot compare to the accuracy or faithfulness to the original gameand -- and the difficulty is delightfully brutal.Still, play this game on Hard (also called 'Classic', which I assume is how the original was).

A bit of a warning though, it's a turn based card based game with a lot of luck involved, so don't expect a fully animated game experience.That being said I enjoyed the artwork of the game tremendously. Pretty much the game revolves around you saving Manhattan from being destroyed by an evil entity within 60 minutes. Be prepared to die a LOT since it's heavily influenced by random dice rolls. One minute you cna be a zombie killing machine with your chainsaw, the next you can easily be killed by a pack of rats.My funny little story from the game revolves around me suddenly being unable to break down a door with a chainsaw and I end up spending the last 1:30 minutes trying to hack a door before the world is engulfed by Darkness. Crazy cultists, radioactive mutants and hordes of zombies are a cakewalk for my killing machine but a simple wooden door has stumped my evil slaying one man army.Overall it's a pretty fun game. Even with all the deaths it keeps you wanting to go through another run just to see what would happen."

Some sort of Warp portal has opened up in a city and you have to send your character, Chainsaw Warrior, to go down there and seal it back up. It is a relatively faithful replication of the original boardgame, to the point of using the same dice and cards.The game holds up pretty well to the original standard, although one would expect for it to become something...more, for a rerelease of an older game. Like optional expansions or something. Still, the game does what it advertises, and isn't that the most important thing.In terms of gameplay, it can be very fun, although the 'standard' difficulty can be frustratingly hard to beat, based on luck as it is. I do not feel the game has much in the way of replay value, however, and for me that is a pretty big negative. If it were not so inexpensive I would not recommend it at all.
