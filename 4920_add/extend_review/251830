It's about a 4-5 hour game that will continuously make you smile. Where some of the frustration coming from the gameplay is mediated immediately by the hilarious characters and overall lighthearted feel of the game. It's like playing a comedy act, in a sense. It has an amazing artstyle, unique and very pretty. ""So much art... such beauty"" to paraphrase a certain seagull. The printscreens really doesn't do the game justice.The gameplay consists of a mixture between platforming, point and click and stealth. It's fine, nothing incredible, but it does it's job. It isn't too hard to progress. It does suffer from having the game be in the way of everything else, where you just want to get past these annoying stealth sessions to get to the good/fun part. The writing and voice acting shined a lot brighter than the gameplay did. This made the mood go down a bit when if you're a complete ♥♥♥♥-up you will be stuck at a few points for a while, but as said before, the game will make it up to you with it's intelligent writing, more or less hilarious humor, artstyle, new and intriguing situations.Buy this game, now, please. Go do it. It's the most I've laughed in a game since Psychonauts and it's really something everyone should play. It's a game with personality, a personality you will like, and that's sort of rare. Have fun."

,Recommended,251830,8117546,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"Damn, Stick It To The Man is just wonderful. The graphics reminded me of Psychonauts, another great game. That's also where the comparison (mostly) stops. Because this game is charming, fun and original, and it manages to do all that all on its own, without the need to copy from other popular games.You play as Ray and early on in the story you manage to get an arm sticking out of your head. Not just an arm, it's actually an alien that makes use of your body. With this arm you can read the minds of other people to get hints on what to do next, but some of the people will also be reminded or think of certain events and that way items can be created.The game plays like a platformer, but the gameplay itself is similar to that of a point-and-click adventure. Minus the frustrating, boring puzzles those games usually have.The voices are done very well, with plenty of variety as far as characters go.It's just a shame that this game is so short. A playthrough will last around 4 hours, which is enough, but it's not enough for a wonderful game like this. I enjoyed it all the way through and never got frustrated. That's partly the reason why I hoped it would last longer. Maybe for a possible sequel (the game does hint at one after all).A game like this should be a critical and financial success. It truly deserves to be. But I seriously doubt that will happen...Anyway, let's wrap this up. My verdict: Stick It To The Man is a must-play and must-own for any serious gamer ![Rating: 88/100]"
,Recommended,251830,10047400,"Posted: 7 May, 2014",all,akhsavi,"It’s a rare gift to deliver an absurd and sparkling but logical (in its own way) story.It’s about:how is it to be Mel Gibson from What Women Want but in video game;reading NPC’s minds and helping them to solve their problems;checking that your “condition was in”;laughing a lot.Why you should play this:the atmosphere of total insanity in sauce of jokes about Smoking Man from X-files, pirates, Peter Pen, Moby-D.ck, nurses and doctors (incl. your favourite - psychiatrists), Big-Foot, Santa Claus, Walking Dead (game or TV show – have no idea, but it was certainly about it), they even refer on old comedy “Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot” with Stallone...stylish “flat” graphic;vivid main character;the game brings forgotten feeling of enjoying playing – not working, not suffering, not nervous trying to beat a hard level, not ""push X to win"" – just pure entertainment.Why you may not like it:it’s short – will take 5…6 hours, not more and maybe 1…2 additional hours to get all achievements, but through the fact that it is a game where humor plays main part it’s quite long;unfortunately, there’s no such thing as replay ability – it’s great only for one time as any good joke.Great parody – unique thing in computer games.

It feels like an old Tim Schafer point and click game.  The puzzles are never very tough and the platforming is never tricky, but the humor and the top notch voice acting carry this game.  Easily some of the best characters I've seen in a game recently.  Just be aware that there are only 10 chapters which take about half an hour each to complete.  I picked it up on sale for around $5 which is a great deal, but I wouldn't have a problem if I paid $15 for it - I know I'll replay it at some point, it's too funny not to."

The art style is cartoony with cardboard figures and looks special in a positive way.StoryU play as Ray, an average guy that one day gets a mysterious tentacle on his head that grants him the ability to read minds, and so a crazy journey begins to find out why this happened to him.My thoughts about the gameI had a great time with this game reading peoples minds, and often there was funny dialogue among the different characters u meet in game. I liked the art and colours in this game, and that the objects u pick up is different stickers for different purposes.The game is sometimes challenging with platform sections, that could be frustrating to some people (including me), but its not a hard portion of the game to master.I recommend this game to all that like puzzle/platformers with a different art style and funny dialogues."

It took me about 4 hours to complete but to me that's perfect because if the game was longer it would get tiresome. The puzzles are simple trial and error on where to put what and the platforming is never hard. I found the game way too easy but I really enjoyed the story and the sense of humor throughout.

If you like Double Fine's games like Psychonauts or old LucasArts adventure games, you'll probably enjoy this. It's a 2.5D side-scrolling action platformer with enemies that you need to be quick to avoid, and also a strongly characterized humourous adventure game where you collect items (in sticker form, of course) to solve ridiculous puzzles and advance the storyline.The protagonist is Ray - a hapless yutz that exists in a world made of paper. Through an accident, he involuntarily gains telepathic/telekinetic powers. Because of his new abilities, he is pursued by The Man responsible for his fate for the rest of the game.Takes about 5 hours to play all the way through, and works very well with a keyboard and mouse - though the in-game instructions are primarily focused on the use of a controller."

An interesting title that does things differently.What not to expect:- combat- platforming- a challengeWhat to expect:- cool sound track (Jazz like I think)- Surreal art style- Funny story and dialogue- An interesting game mechanic (you basically can mind read people, steal their thoughts, ""stick"" them somewhere else and use it to grab high ledges)- logical ""puzzles""Synopsis: You are Ray, Ray has a spaghetti arm growing out of his head with which he can do the aforementioned things. Reading people's minds will unlock the ""puzzles"", which are mainly get A to B to progress. Sounds boring, but the challenge is not what makes the game appealing. It's the art style, the humour, the semi-professional voice acting and the chilled sound track.It's definitely worth picking up for about 10 dollars or so and can be beaten in about 5-6 hours I'd say. There is NO replay value, however, so maybe you want to pick this up during a sale. I found it entertaining enough and got it via summer sale.Definitely recommended, just for NOT being an indie platformer, FPS or roguelike game, which is apparently all the indie scene has to offer, which doesn't suck. Oh and some sim games I guess..."

Poor Ray, a bit of a shlub, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, ends up with a telekinetic/telepathic alien stuck inside his head. On the run from a shady government organization he has to use his new found powers to read the minds of everyone around him, steal the thoughts from their minds and then use them to solve the obstacles between him and safety. The writing is some of the best I've seen in a long time, even just eavesdropping on people who have no relevance to your current obstacle is well worth the laughter it brings. There is a trailer. Go watch it, then go buy the game. The kind of cleverness and creativity on display here puts me in mind of Double Fine at their finest. If you miss out on this, your world is a sadder and darker place and I pity you."
76561198135753955,Recommended,251830,29018496,Posted: 4 January,all,Arielrocks5,"For the record, I have no clue why this game is called ""Stick it to The Man"" even if you don't end up sticking anything to him throughout the entire game and the titular ""man"" doesn't become a promint figure until the final chapter. But I think ""Weird Wavy Purple Hand Sticking out of Head and sticking various stickers onto other objects and backgrounds"" would have been too long of a title.Anyway, this is my first time really reviewing a game (I'm mostly a film reviewer, so I'm sorry if I seem a bit out of touch and this review itself being all over the place) and I figured it would be of one I got during the big sale recently and thought was worth talking about.I never heard of this game until the sale and even then, I did it mostly because it was cheap and thought it looked cute enough. ""Stick it to The Man"" tells the story of Ray, a guy who lives in a world made up entirely out of paper materiel and stickers. After getting hit on the head, he suddenly wakes up with a big purple hand sticking out of his head and now has the ability to read minds and pull down various objects in the backgrounds and foregrounds.It's pretty straight forward in terms of gameplay: grab objects, stick them to others, run, jump, read minds of anyone to figure out what thing to stick on them, etc and etc.Oh, and you also must avoid being caught by henchmen of ""The Man"" in these small segments that appear every now and then in chapters, along with using your purple hand to grab onto thumbtacks as a grappling hook.It's decently done and kept me playing, but it's nothing I doubt many familiar with adventure games or platformers will think is breaking any new grounds. Puzzles are fairly easy to figure out (but still rather fun to do so) and for the most part, the levels go by in a snap if you know what you need to do with certain stickers and characters.In the grand scheme of things, Gameplay doesn't really seem to main focus of the team behind this. The main focus seems to be mostly on the various types of quirky characters and very odd scenarios/solutions for puzzles and see how many laughs they can get out of the player.I can't really say this game is flat out hilarious or even THAT much nuanced to the weird comedy genre, but there's something oddly charming about it.The art direction looks like ""The Simpsons"" meets ""Psychonauts"" with this odd cardboard and paper aesthetic that's equal parts fun to look at and very bizarre, along with the soundtrack, which is pretty fun too (give ""Get me a Shrink!"" a listen to if you're in the mood for some funky jazz)The writing in general kept me consistently chuckling and laughing through, but I dunno, it all feels.......token? Like, I've felt like I've seen these types of punchlines before but I can't put my finger on where exactly (it could be Matt Groening, Tim Schafer, or Dan Povenmire, but it could be something else entirely), but they're still funny and it made me want to see where it would go next.Voice acting is pretty solid across the broad, but there's some moments (mostly during jokes) that the timing of the punchlines feel a bit off, which for a comedy game is a pretty big fail, but it doesn't happen as often as I was dreading.The weird characters you meet throughout the journey are pretty interesting to watch in the ""what the hell is going to be the outcome for him/her?"" sorta way and the game itself ends on a fairly nice punchline.If there's any other issue in regards to gameplay, I would say the segments with the henchmen get pretty tedious after awhile and it's often annoying to be reading the mind of one, only to then have them walk out of the frame you can do so as they charge over to you, with a small delay between moments of getting in control again.I would say as well it's A BIT over priced (?) for four hours of standard Adventure Game stuff if that's what you're looking for, but if you're looking for a breezy, simple, and charming little time killer, stick this one into your chart.7/10"
,Recommended,251830,31419720,Posted: 28 April,all,waelhadaya,"Stick it to the Man is funky, colorful and elegant piece of game, it’s a mixture of “point and click” and light platforming, all though it’s pushed back slightly by the short length and the annoying chase sections.I like the paper graphics here, it’s so elegant and cheerful, the music is beautiful and spot on that it couldn’t get better actually, the puzzles are fun to solve, and the atmosphere will get you hooked in immediately.The characters are memorable and light hearted, almost every dialogue is funny, it’s full of comedy and unique humor, it never failed to make me smile the whole way through (especially the Elvis guy, and the beep beep boob beep robot).I would say it could have been better with a higher score in my opinion if it wasn’t short, 5 hours for a play through is arguably short for my taste, also the chasing sections are nothing but annoying, it felt like an afterthought by the developer to add more gameplay elements I guess which the game lacks anyway.I do recommend this game, it’s awesome, I rate it a sticky 7 out of 10."

The jokes were close by, each of them funny and punchy. The music was fun - most of it wasn't memorable at all, yet it fit perfectly, but the title song was magic. The art was unique, original, fun, and throughout the game world are little background and foreground jokes that add a bit of spice to an already fantastic looking game. Characters were lively, silly, voiced EXCELLENTLY, their inner thoughts giving way to some very good jokes - it's little homages to gaming were tasty icing to naturally good comedy - that actually handle scat humour with real wit. You learned to love our little protagonist and his head... thing. While the puzzles were strange, they made sense, and the wonderful thing about this game that they were solved simply by curiously peeking into peoples thoughts everywhere you went, and you wouldn't play this game if you didn't want to do that. And, like many other people, the game is actually fun for the brief sections where you run from the guards. Those parts get harder with a proper curve, and are fun, and briefly exhilirating. It was a nice way to counter balance the slow puzzling. And the length? It had a story to tell, and it told it quickly. This kind of game was more like a movie than anything else, and the running gag can only last so long. So, by not making looong pointless areas, they condensed everything to a perfectly proportioned pie of funny and pictures and visual stimuli, with a quick, fun story. I wouldn't want it longer, because everything they did felt good. I didn't feel like I wanted more - was satisfied, and laughing. And that, with good voice acting, art style, jokes, pacing, gameplay, game mechanincs, characters, music, and identity, is really, all you can ask for, isn't it? And this game had all of that in SPADES. LARGE SPADES. SHOVELS, EVEN.10/10, Liked It, 5 Stars, *****. And it's not satanically expensive! Buy it!Buy it now!

I wasn't expecting it to be the type of game where you have to tactially avoid baddies & make sure you jump correctly to certain ledges. I found this element frustrating as the game went on as it was a case of repeated the same actions over & over again. The puzzle solving in the game was too simple & obvious. I missed that feeling you get whilst playing an Adventure Game of trying to work out things to progress further. The storyline was also pretty basic and almost as two dimensional as the cardboard characters. It's main strenghs for me were the ideas, art & humour. This game is packed full of quirky ideas & creativity. I have never played a game like it before. The Game Design is simular to Little Big Planet with a linear 2D layout. Another strong point was how much you (Ray) feel like an outsider during the game. By mainly interacting by listening to things thoughts, whilst being ignored, it made it seem like you were an alien on your own planet. It juxaposes the other characters who we feel are really the wacky ones. It is worth buying in a sale, if you're thinking about it."

However, I did not regret my purchase of this game at all. Worst case scenario for you: Just buy it on sale, and you should have no issues.This game is so unique and drew me in much more than I expected. The story, from a high-level perspective, is a bit cheesy, and the villain of the game is also somewhat annoying and lacks thrill, BUT that is intentional to fit with the overall style of the game. It is really off-the-wall, filled with random silly jokes and a good bit of dark humor (a couple of places are surprisingly dark), but it all flowed together, in an intentionally messy way.The art is in this paper and sticker format, which actually was done in such a way that I enjoyed it very much. It was not tacky at all. Everything is very well drawn, and a good amount of the level design and characters have this interesting sort of dreary, grimy look. Some items, buildings, people, and so on, are brighter and stand out from everything else that has a background tone or shading, but the background itself is really detailed and by all means should be looked at just as much as the stuff with which you interact.The theme song of the game was a very good pick, and the sounds and music as you play are pretty simple in most places, but also enjoyable. I did not have a problem with anything that I heard in the game. Then you have the voice acting, which was amazing. So many characters voiced by a small amount of people, and they were definitely unique as well. I didn't notice any characters sounding too close to each other.The game itself is split into chapters, or essentially levels, and you must explore the levels and solve small puzzles where other characters are wanting specific objects. You must find the objects either lying around somewhere, or by obtaining them from other characters. As you help certain characters out, they will sometimes do things like break/open doors for you to continue on in the level, or end up giving you another item that you will have to figure out how to use. While the general idea is simple or not necessarily exciting, the game really benefits from its style as mentioned above, as well as the actual gameplay of how you will do the puzzle-solving.Your character, Ray, has an accident and ends up with a weird arm sticking out of his head, which in and of itself allows for the gameplay. The game is an interesting mix of platforming and point-and-click, where you use your mouse to control the arm and grab objects that you need, as well as do something stranger: read other characters' minds. When you read their minds, you will sometimes just hear thoughts and jokes, while other times will give you hints about what to currently do in a level (e.g., what a character might be looking for), or even end up having a character release a thought cloud which contains an item that you can grab and carry with you.Don't worry, though: You shouldn't get bored by the above, as the level design and characters are very interesting (as I know I have said multiple times so far), and just about every time you give an item to someone, a cutscene will occur showing some wacky events happening that will very likely make you laugh (assuming you enjoy the humor of the game). Hence, I had fun every single minute of the game, running around and figuring out what to do with so many weird items and people you encounter.Again, I will say that the game surprised me. I watched some of the trailers and thought it seemed really odd, and maybe funny, but I didn't go in with any fancy expectations. It turned out to be a lot more than what I felt while watching the trailers. So, unless you absolutely hate the scenes in the trailers, I would say to give the game a chance, even if you are on the fence or somewhat unsure. I expect that you will also be surprised like I was. I really recommend this game."

,Not Recommended,251830,33289676,Posted: 5 July,all,General Kass,"A 2.5d puzzle platformer desperately trying to be Psychonauts, but without any interesting characters or gameplay.Aside from the obviously Double Fine inspired art direction, this game reminds me of Double Fine’s The Cave in how simplistic it’s puzzles are. Levels are long, self-contained 2.5 platforming sets, like The Cave. Single level puzzles ensure that everything will be wrapped up neatly and that there will never be a challenge. There aren’t even red herring puzzle items, like The Cave. Puzzles are extremely obvious due to the mind reading effect, which tells you the answer.For example: A dog says, “I wish I had teeth so I could bite these dudes” and by sheer coincidence you have a crocodile tooth sticker.There are only two scenarios in which you'll have a spare item and both of those are used for achievement related side-puzzles. The result is a puzzle game with no challenging puzzles.The jokes are really hit or miss and a lot of them are references. Yes, you did a Mario joke, well done; that horse was beaten into a red paste 20 years ago, what else do you got? Aside from “humorous” observations, the game's other running joke is giving animals antiquated Shakespearean accents and vocabularies that can only be discovered by reading their minds. It's funny the first time, but when every single animal talks like a Victorian-era art critic, it loses its charm faster than a Leprechaun on speed.Probably the biggest difference between The Cave and Stick it to the Man is the atmosphere. The Cave took place in dark empty areas with one or two NPCs. Stick it to the Man occurs in large city environments and is based on quietly helping other characters solve their problems. I was actually really impressed by one aspect: Most puzzles have a running theme of repairing unlikely relationships. Unfortunately, that's the game's only real source of inspiration and, paired with the frankly huge cast of one-dimensional characters, the atmosphere loses its charm faster than a Leprechaun on speed.The voice acting is just terrible. Let me explain. In voice work, characters have funny voices; funny voices don’t make characters. With little exception, every character has a similarly overextended speech pattern and a wacky accent which proves to be more distracting than funny or immersive.The main character's voice sounds like a cheese grater with a New York accent.In fairness though, some of the worst voice work comes from horrific dialogue writing.You’ll hear “I should have not stayed up all night LAST NIGHT eating burritos, yet I have no regret about eating burritos all night,” and similar lines about micro-naps dozens and dozens of times. This attempt at humor (its not really a joke) would only have been funny once, but the game design forces you to commit the greatest sin in all of comedy games: repeating the joke over and over and over and over again. It loses its charm faster than a Leprechaun on speed.Dr. Brom (who is based on Dr. Monroe from The Simpsons), the taxidermist, blue haired radio operator, and the mother are the only consistently good character voices in the entire game.Ray (the PC) and Ted (the alien that lives inside his head) are the worst voices, by far.Yet even the voice acting cannot compare to the hideous ""plot"" of this game. From the get go, the plot is essentially the PC being chased by bad guys. There's an apparent mystery with a psychologist (who Ray has never met before) but it doesn't go anywhere. Despite having a huge set up, nothing in this game's storyline has any pay off.  The antagonist makes a number of intro-cutscene apperances, but they don't amount to anything. You make it to the end of your 3 hour journey and nothing is gained. You don't know why the bad guy is evil and neither does he. Once he finally gets what he wants he say something to the effect of ""Why did I do this anyway?"" The antagonist is as confused as the player. The result is a comedy puzzle game that fails to be funny and has no interesting puzzles, but does have a host of one-dimensional characters, terrible voice acting, and a nonsense plot (even for a game that takes place in a world of stickers and cardboard).$15 for 3 hours of terrible puzzles, terrible writing, terrible voice acting, and a terrible story."

It's a puzzle platformer that's more of a point-and-click, but neither of those facets of the game aren't super successful.The main mechanics of Stick it to the Man! are reading people's minds to gather information and manipulating the world by peeling off stickers and placing them on other things to solve problems, all while avoiding government agents out to get you.The mind reading part is tedious. The voice acting is great, but some characters speak very slowly and by the time you finish reading the subtitiles, the character is only halfway through his or her speech. Dialogue cannot be skipped in pieces or scrolled through, only sped up or skipped entirely.The puzzles themselves aren't anything special. One of the recurring ""puzzles"" (if you may call it that) is escaping the agents trying to get you. I didn't enjoy any of these segments. I'm assuming the game expects you to cleverly sneak around the enemies, placing stickers on them to make them fall asleep or distract them. However, this is usually impossible to do as you can't see all the agents on the screen at once and you have only a few seconds before they notice you and start chasing you around. It's much easier to just run to the other side than trying to spend time sticking stickers on people and getting caught.Stick it to the Man's strongest element is its art style. The character design is amazing as every character looks unique with a different personality. Everything has a cardboard or paper-y texture, but it's different than, say, Paper Mario. It's almost as if the game would be stronger as a cartoon instead of a video game, or maybe if the focus was more on a point-and-click style than a platformer.Overall, I don't think I can recommend this game as a game, but, if you like art and design, it might be worth it to at least try it."

Each solution is simiple enough and will usually cause a domino effect giving you the solution for another puzzle in the process within a level. The biggest problem with the game though is when you try to read someones mind, the controls don't work correctly and it takes several tries to the the mind of the character and its not throughly explained.

The music is nice and fitting as well, and the voice acting is of good quality, but that's as far as this game goes. The storyline, I honestly believe they just made it up as they went along, and the dialogue is often cheap, (I'm willing to forgive them for that though, they had to include some cheap dialogue to have as many jokes as what they did (and they had a lot, mostly irony and dark humour, but some satire against popular culture as well) prepare to be pun'd) but the most disapointing part of the game is the gameplay itself, it is literally just a combination of zelda style item collecting / trading, and hostile encounters that pretend to add gameplay, but aren't very well expanded on. This game isn't a puzzler, it's a storyline grind without a storyline, and for that reason I give it a thumbs down, but if it were the free online flash game that it is meant to be, then even if the graphical fidelity wouldn't be nearly as amazing, it would do really well.

Be it the smooth jazz tracks playing in the background, or the delightfully strange and wonderful characters inhabiting an equally kooky cardboard-cut-out universe.Reading others’ minds is a voyeuristic pleasure, especially when the dialogue is brought to life by genuinely amusing and convincing voice acting. The artwork and art direction are on point, too. Designs and illustrations are reminiscent of 90’s cartoons, a la Rocko’s Modern Life and Ren & Stimpy. I particularly enjoy the portraits that adorn the map screen for any given area.A lot of care has been taken to ensure the player is thrust into a lively, yet bizarre rendition of a down-town, American city. A game highly recommended for anyone wanting to jump into something fun, light-hearted, and completely silly, which also sports incredible polish.[Edit: After completing the game]What an incredible ride!

Also, the story and riddles are enjoyable.I must say that I was first dragged to this game by ""Just dropped in (to see what condition my condition was in)"" song by Kenny Rogers, which in my mind is strongly connected with ""The Big Lebowski"" movie - so I expected that the game will remind me it somehow.

Basically a man named Ray get's hit on the head and brain slug possesses his mind, giving him the ability to read other peoples thoughts and rip them out to convenience himself. The game plays like a fast paced point and click game where you wander through the levels reading minds and taking their thoughts and using the objects taken to get others help you get through each chapter. The humor goes from dark to self aware, but always keeps this upbeat additude that makes  anything dark hilarious. Like a chef who wants to flavor his stew, and requires the tears of a broken heart for flavor, and then pulls a severed human arm out to taste test the stew. You also have to contend with a mysterious organization that wants the brain slug back and the become an obstacle in Ray way and slowly becoming the big threat in the game.As far as replayablity goes, it's pretty much non-existant save for getting any achivements you haven't gotten. The games charm comes from interacting all the characters and their quirks and once you beat the game, and complete the puzzles  these points become pointless and you can pretty much beat the game in a third of the time in a second playthrough. because of this, the 14.99 price tag seems steep, so i would recommend getting it when it goes on sale.

Then I turned them off by accident and suddenly found myself enjoying the game significantly more.One thing I wish the game had was more flexibility in applying stickers.

On the run from a shady organization with evil plans, Ray must find a way to return to normal while also stopping the organization, all the while using his newfound powers to help people around him.I've been interested in this game since its release, but I've put off its purchase for a long time.  I instantly regretted that once I started playing.  This game is easily worth its full price.  Following the storyline and getting every achievement will net you between 4 to 5 hours of playtime, which is the perfect spot for the price while still mantaining the novelty of the gameplay.It's a really easy game (though, like in all adventure games, you're bound to get stuck for a bit at least once), it's more about the experience than the challenge.  Outlandish characters, fourth-wall breaking, and overall funny dialogue are the meat of the game.  Gameplay-wise, the majority consists of using your abilities to solve puzzles, by both reading minds and make use of stickers to change around the environment.  There's also some light platforming and a few stealth sections, but they're there just to add some variety and they're mostly a means to an end.

If you are looking for a cartoony game that's casual and has a lot of personality, you could do a lot worse than this one."

The writing is quirky and funny and pokes fun at mentality and the psyche, which I've always been interested in. As limited an amount of voice actors they had, the characters were really interesting, likeable, and had a good delivery on their lines when they expressed. Gameplay is like stealth/puzzle/platformer which is fun and can be challenging without being frustrating. I also enjoyed the music and it's jazzy feel during earlier chapters. Although short, it's definitely a fun ride that I truly enjoyed. I only ever had one glitch happen once, but it wasn't gamebreaking. It did softlock the game and make me reload my save, though it was minor compared to the fun experience I had."

It's kinda funny, and pretty interesting.The only thing I can say against this game is that it's really short (I think I finished it in less than 5 hours), and a lot of that was running around an enjoying the scenery.  The levels are large, but often quite empty of anything to do.Grab it in a sale and start sticking!"
