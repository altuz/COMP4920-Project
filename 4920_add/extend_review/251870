Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~"" is a ""choice adventure game"" in which the protagonist, which is a foreigner admiring Japan, experiences the life in Japan and tours famous tourist attractions during his homestay with the older sister Makoto and the younger sister Akira (tsundere) that he met online.It is originally made for foreigner otaku who have an interest in Japan, the UI is in English, but the speech lines can be displayed in Japanese and English at the same time, which lets people learn the language at the same time too.The amount of CG is small, it doesn't stop at only being a guide to Japan's tourist attractions, it also introduces manners like saying ""itadakimasu"" before meals, how to eat Japanese food, how to use SUICE and PASMO, the toilet seats with functions, and even small details like the obviousness of how Japanese people are used to vending machines and konbini operating 24-hours per day in Japan. But there is too much info that I found it boring.The StoryThe protagonist heads off for a week’s stay in Japan with two friends he met online, who show him around the sights. one playthrough you get to choose 3 destinations to visit out of a total of 6 options, plus you have a trip to Kyoto, and a trip outside of Tokyo on your last day with whichever girl whose route you’ve ended up on. Then after the credits you get a cute bonus scene with your return to Japan.Visual and Music elementsSightseeing Album where you can look back on the places ypu have visited and read up on them. I liked the animation during the train journeys which created a real sense of motion.As for the music there is nothing too fancy and I have nothing to say here.To sum upI think that anyone whose dream is to go to Japan will enjoy it, but personally I found it boring and if you are intrested to learn about Japan and its culture, then this would be the game for you because it is very detailed.Click here for the full review!"

,Recommended,251870,9207727,"Posted: 21 February, 2014",all,Slayn Fayt,"I recommend this game for those who wish to take an interest in traveling to this. I have gone to Japan many times before and this game reminded me of my guide as a service i had in 2010. They showed me many of these areas before and provided their share of interest. Playing this game also reminds me of the different foods though. Thoroughly a good game guide to a basic level. however I recommend that if you do travel choose between Kansai and Narita. The one in 2010 took Narita as It does say here. It provides a nice insight to the areas many do want to visit and obviously quite nice they put the USD Converters to Yen because it is that helpful. Believe it or not, this game is great. At a good price. I recommend it 7-9/10 in it's own way. I just wish there were more travel locations and foods. The game mentions the usual attractions and a story between you and these two. However replayable is necessary due to limited days. Locations include popular shrines, Akihabara, Shibuya's Hachiko, and Mt. Fuji. In it's right, it's worth the buy and on average it's short but educational. Plus those who want to take a look into Japan, this is a more accurate version with the matters of scenery, travel, and places. If you do go and don't know anyone, grab a guide and trust me you won't regret it. Just remember though don't think too high and bring a lot of cash. Trust me this game may keep the rate the same but in RL, the exchange rates can change so fast during hours of the day. If I were to give it a score. 6.4-8 due to it's playthrough, limited area, good story, dialogue, but it lacks location, extended travel days, and covers one area. Yet as it is a game, I can say it did it's job right with the guides. So for in total the average would be a 7.5-7.8. Although this game was released in 2011, adding it here will help those who didn't know much. Either way enjoy the game for what it is. I know I did, just wished that we had another version, different guides, different area, you know. Needs that litle extra. Still good in it's own right. Enjoyable."

I feel as if I understand the characters emotions on a cosmic level. Even though I have known the two sisters in this game for such a short time, I feel as if I have known them for 2 years, possibly 2 years and 5 months. The writting in this game is shrektacular; it's as if Hideo Kojima himself came down from the heavens and blessed this game with his awe-inspiring writting ingenuity.The visuals in this visual novel are also quite breath-taking, I've never seen such brilliant stylizations since Crysis. Already you're immersed in the lives of these two sisters that you're living with for a week as they tell you useless and useful information about the various regions of japan.My 10 years of experience in anime could not prepare me for the level of kawaii I was about to witness; a ground-breaking visual novel that gripped my heart one moment, and shattered it the next. If this game was a person, it could emancipate an agictated ostrich by playing bethoven's 5th with an empty pringles can and a pair of chopsticks.

Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate.Add the pork, skin-side down, to the same pot and sear until crisp and golden, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 5 minutes. Remove and transfer to the bacon plate.Add the garlic, carrots, celery and onions to the same pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the sake and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the pork and bacon back into the pot, and then add the soy sauce, 1 cup of water, the gochujang and sesame oil. Bring to a simmer, cover and transfer to the oven. Cook until the pork is falling off the bone, about 4 hours, basting the pork every hour. After 2 hours, add an additional cup of water.Remove the pork to a board and let stand for about 10 minutes. While the pork is resting, use a ladle to skim off most, but not all, of the fat from the braising liquid. Set aside 1 cup of the chunky braising liquid and then add the brown sugar to the remaining braising liquid in the pot. Shred the pork with two forks and then add the meat back into the pot, mixing with the remaining braising liquid. Set aside the pork bone.For the soup stock: Heat the canola oil in a large stockpot over high heat. Add the mushrooms, carrots, celery, garlic and onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the reserved pork bone and chunky braising liquid, and cover with the chicken stock and 3 quarts of water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for 2 hours. Strain the broth and add soy sauce to taste.For the ramen and toppings: Cook the ramen noodles according to the package directions. Drain and set aside.Prepare a medium bowl with ice water. Bring a small pot of water to a boil and add the eggs. Cook the eggs for 6 minutes, and then use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the ice water. While running the eggs under cold water, gently peel each one, being careful not to break the yolks. Place the eggs in a bowl and set aside.To serve, divide the ramen between the bowls and ladle the broth over them. Add a heaping spoonful each of the shredded pork, corn and kimchi to each of the bowls. Place an egg in each bowl and sprinkle the scallions on top. Fold a sheet of nori in quarters and tuck on the side of each bowl."

On the one hand, it presents a rather awkward dating scenario between yourself and a pair of Japanese girls who host your stay in Japan. Let’s hope you like girls then. It doesn't seem to cross the developer’s minds that you might not. Anyway, the far more interesting activity, in my humble opinion, is the exploration of Japan and some of it’s main tourist attractions. That's really quite good!

,Recommended,251870,21138942,"Posted: 11 February, 2016",all,Yuiself,"*This ""would-be professionally made"" review will mostly cover Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ Ver. 2015, as that version has twice the amount of content compared to this base game version*Rest assured, this game is an odd one - well, technically a ""Visual Novel"", but odd because it provides an education on the Japanese culture for those actually interested in it. And make no mistake when people say this game fills a small gap in a Japanophile's wet dream - that is pretty much true. But there's another reason I decided to make a positive review of this game: my enjoyment for this game was (and still is) two-fold.Visual novels - hereby referred to as VN - often suffer from poor localisation, cringeworthy translation and/or lack of content (and with it, replayability). This is the case with most VN's published by Sekai Project and Winged Cloud. Granted, they do provide great eyecandy but the characters, the story and the quality of the dialogue fall really flat as a result - hardly anyone buys Nekopara or a Sakura game for its story.Go! Go! Nippon however is a different case. Sure, the story is pretty much non-existent besides the ""Gaijin-protagonist-visits-Japan"" synopsis but all the things that are pretty much thrown away in Sekai Project's and Winged Cloud's VN's have been handled with love - and it shows. You'll get to know the Misaki sisters Akira and Makoto as you venture through six locales (ten, if you play the 2015 version) and educate yourself with some Japanese culture and its history. You'll also grow fond of them up to the point where you'll have to choose whom you'll want to be with the most between the two sisters – which is pretty heart-breaking, all things considering.The education aspect in Go! Go! Nippon is another differentiating factor: you get a sufficient amount of information about the locales and Japan's history in a reasonably bite-sized package while still managing to be fun and not boring, being accompanied by either of the Misaki sisters during the trip.With the content being twice as large as the base game, you'll find yourself visiting your virtual Japan again and again as there are multiple endings that you can achieve – two for each girl, as opposed to having only one in the non-2015 version.  And let's not forget the quality of the localisation: it's surprisingly okay. It's not something you'd cringe on the first line or on the first five minutes you invest in the experience, which is a huge win in my eyes.Also, there are a few things added to Go! Go! Nippon! Ver. 2015 not present in the old base game. The E-Mote System certainly adds character and life to Akira and Makoto as they smile, stare at you in surprise and give you the ""you w0t?"" face. You can also check the locale's via Google Maps as you visit them in-game to further deepen your research and plan on your would-be IRL trip to Japan or just look at them in curiousity.Go! Go! Nippon! (especially the Ver. 2015) is a surprisingly great experience, despite the ""weeaboo"" target audience this VN is aimed mostly towards. It adds some educational elements to the experience while also remaining what it is – a visual reading experience, with something to see and... well, experience."

Stunning visuals, an amazing guide to many sights around Tokyo (and elsewhere), great characters, and an amusing plot. Let's start with the set-up. You are a foreigner (most likely American, but I think you can change the base money rate to any English-speaking country) who has decided to fulfill their love of Japanese things by travelling to Japan and enlisting the help of these two nice boys who you've been conversing with on-line. Upon arrival... you realize that a bit of name confusion has taken place, and the two boys you were talking to are actually sisters... (Akira and Makoto are apparently unisex names.) And, their parents won't be there for the time you will be in Japan...Anyway, no shenanigans take place (aside from unfortunate walk-ins to rooms at inopportune times). Through the game you can tour the Tokyo area with your preferred girl (the sites show who will accompany you, only one location do both go to, and then there is a separation point). There are some side events triggered by going to certain locations. There is an exact progression for a few of the achievements, but mostly just go at your own pace.This is a fun little game and I recommend it to anyone.Also note that for all the achievements you will need both expansions."

If, like me, you get bored of reading text that fails to draw you in to begin with, you'll be clicking on the skip button quite a bit. Then again, even that has its flaw when the button stops at a random text box, making you click it off to turn it back on again.When it comes to the artwork, it's alright. But that's really the imagery concerning the areas of Tokyo. When it comes to ""you"" stumbling upon Akira getting changed or Makoto in the wash room, it's just unnecessary padding. It's there for a split second, drawn out before the next venture and never mentioned again.Last, but not least, the love plot. Oh god, the love plot. You could have kept the guy as their friend and it would have made as much sense. Visit 2 areas of Japan with either sister and they're your love interest of the game, and it's all set for you. Choose an area, say...Shibuya, and your tour guide is Akira. Two tours, love confirmed. That's it.As far as graphic novel genres go, this felt like it WANTED to be a dating sim but gave up half-way.For its good points: Artwork, music and information had been put in to Guide Book degree.For its bad points: Bad plot, dim-witted protagonist and unconvincing love plots.I give it a 3 out of 10."

You are better off looking elsewhere if you are SERIOUS about knowing more about Japan.This is a more comprehensive review. Otherwise, there's nothing stopping you from paying for the game and enjoying a glorious experience. Have fun~This Visual Novel basically serves as a nice short tour around a few sightseeing spots in Tokyo (hint: and Kyoto) along with two knowledgable girls who volunteered to serve as your guide during your short stay there. Explore around Japan in 2D as you develop a closer relationship with your guides. Google Maps link included at each sightseeing spot. (heh)Your cute tour guides will show you several aspects of Japanese culture and some common occurances, as well as also providing a pretty decent explanation over each location. Though you might not able to see much, it gives you a vague idea of what to expect if you were to go there yourself.As a VN, it provides abasic experience, with decent graphics and a short yet sweet storyline. The replay value isn't very much at all. You probably only need to replay the whole game at most once to view all the locations. Decision making will come up during destination picks for the first three days and during occasions when you have to pick something to eat, but there isn't much options for you otherwise.In short, you are buying this VN because:1.

There are no game mechanics in play.  What this IS, is a tourist's introduction to Tokyo, with some anime-style story-fluff built around it.  There are no meaningful choices to be made, just picking what order you do things in.  The rest of your time will be spent reading.  It could just as easily have been made into a TV spot, and you wouldn't have to click as much.That said, the art is decent, the summaries of various districts are made relatable, and I had fun learning things.  So I'm recommending it.  It's one of the better edutainment products I've tried and worth the five bucks in prep-work for an upcoming overseas trip.

I just finished the game, ending up in the ""Akira Route"" on my first try. I assume that it was based on the number of times we went out sightseeing together. It was two times, Akihabara, and I forgot the other one. The order I chose to sightseeing was standard, first to last. Since I only got to choose 3 times. I chose the first on day one, second on day two, and so on. So Makoto - Akira - Akira - Both Girls - Akira. I expected I was able to see all the sightseeing spots that was in the list, but it turns out I didn't, and with that, I really think that's the ""actual choice"" to see whose route you're going down on.So what's the game exactly? It's an educational visual novel! What I do like about the game is the ""Show Photo Location"" or whatever it was that when clicked, it prompts up your web browser and goes to google maps, and shows google 3D-perspective images...on most, since there are some areas that aren't covered with google gps cars or whatever they were.I've been seeing some discussions about explicit images, raep~, romance intensive, and shiz. Come on guys, is that how we think of Japan? Okay probably...but the game isn't that. There are only 2 ecchi scenes, and the rest are fine.So overall...ye, quite educational. The visual novel is basically ""How 2 Japan"" in a nutshell. No complicated romance stuff, which I don't really find arguable nor I am disappointed. Since the title is named ""Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~"", so most likely you are gonna be a tourist. So ye, romance isn't a priority.If I have one complaint, it's the protagonist.MC is a [b♥♥♥♥♥/b] imo.

You actually do learn things about japan along the way and you get two cute characters to lead you along the way. It takes a while for the relationship of the main character and the girls to blossom but other than that I enjoyed the personality contrasts between the two sisters. Plus, there is replay value since you obviously don't get the ending of both girls at once. Also, you will not be able to visit every place on your first playthrough or possibly even your second. So there is potential for much more. It's a silly adventure and you just need to take it for what it is. I think I ended up beating this in 5 hours since I took my time through it.

Nippon! was the first title that MangaGamer published on Steam, and me being a vivid VN player and Japanese Studies student, I instantly felt the need to get this game. At first, this seemed like a perfect start for Visual Novels to appear on Steam, especially after other titles like Analogue and its sequel, Hate Plus. But after going through all of it, I'm not sure whether this is worth your time.This game feels more like a kinetic visual novel, with choices that don't really make a difference. You can go through the whole story without saving a single time, but because of forced branching you'll have to go through it twice (blind choices however). Basically, the estimate as given by the VNDB is correct (2 to 10 hours). Is paying 10 dollars worth this gameplay time? Up to you to decide. The characters are quite stereotypical but on the other hand, you can enter your own name, which might be quite to your liking. I just wished that they also showed the Japanese price (instead of just your own currency) when buying something, since you most likely will be carrying only Japanese yen with you while you travel.So why do I not recommend this game? Basically, I found it a bit too short for my liking (at least Europeans tend to travel for at least 2 weeks when going this far abroad), but there's something that was bugging me more. The translation quality. I found it very lacking and so did other friends of mine who are proficient at Japanese. I made several screenshots that show obvious grammatical mistakes that usually only beginners would make. Since this game is actually giving both the Japanese and the English text, it's supposed to be aimed for Japanese language learners (you would have no other reason otherwise), but this definitely backfires instead.Another thing is that the game is already quite dated. While the game released on Steam this February, it was first released in September 2011. At one point of the story, they're talking about the Tokyo Skytree, which was yet to be opened on the time of the release, but it's one of the most popular tourist attractions nowadays. I also felt like they're not talking enough about the typical spots too. Not a single word about Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea, and even the 109 building at the Shibuya Scramble Crossing. Kinkaku-ji was greatly praised, but no word of it's counterpart, Ginkaku-ji.If you feel like you might go to Japan for the first time someday, with Tokyo as main destination, and love to have some nice fantasy about it beforehand, pick it up if you think it's worth the money. If you're already studying Japanese, chances are you know most of it already, and this will make you kind of annoyed at some times. The main protagonist is a know-all when it comes to Japanese, but is a complete blockhead when it comes to the culture. It's also feels incomplete, so if you want a great guide...Just buy an actual guidebook. Or else...Just find some Japanese tour guides in real life. It's not that hard if you look for backpacker or couchsurf sites out there."

,Recommended,251870,12281143,"Posted: 28 September, 2014",all,「Ｂｏｋｕ♥」,"Go! Go! Nippon! is a short visual novel most likely intended to be more educational or at least to lend a somewhat idealised insight of a trip to Japan rather than to be a standalone story. The cast is downright minimal, CG usage sparse and quality of the writing quite basic. However, as much as its possible to reprimand its simplicity it can just as much be a positive note -- it feels as though this would make a neat little ""My First VN"".The novelty of GGN! comes from its usage of a dual text box showing both English and original Japanese text. For anyone interested in learning or, perhaps more adequately, someone who has a moderate knowledge of the language it makes a nice reference point. If I had any criticism of this it was that it wasn't possible to hide one or the other languages on the fly (to practice reading and translating) and there was no option to enable furigana for the more complex/rare kanji to really make it stand out as a learning aid. A full AGTH-like interface such as the ability to hover individual words/kanji and see more detailed information would have really made it useful for this, although this could have been achieved manually by playing with a dictionary in hand.The protagonist is very much meant to be a self-insert for the player: someone who wishes to visit Japan and knows odd bits of the history and customs through anime as well as a bit of study; punctuated in moments where some of their expectations get shot down when reality has been stretched by the fiction they know. The only real sense of disbelief here is that while they claim to have done a ""little bit of study"" on the language, they speak damn near fluently save for plot, learning or surprise. The two girls of the game -- Makoto and Akira -- are very much cardboard cutouts of standard anime personalities: the knowledgeable and understanding older sister and the tsundere, slightly tomboyish younger sister. As far as writing is concerned I cant really fault either of them as much as I cant really find much interesting or unique about them. Its almost clinical. The romance between either one of them feels rather contrived also. More dialog/choices during trips with them probably wouldve done well to blur this a bit.Anyone who has been to Japan may find themselves relating or reminiscing with the protagonist, their mindset and any revelations they encounter (the teeming trains and scarcity of ATMs being mine) but, as I say, this VN is most likely intended for people who havent had the opportunity to visit and are willing to play a short VN on the subject as a form of self-tortu-- motivation.Theres a number of VNs out there I can and would recommend to people not interested in Japan, anime or even the culture at all but (and this probably goes without saying) this is not one of them. It feels a cop-out to end a review like this, but if you even think youll like this game then you likely will. GGN! is very much a game built for people who would be interested in the first place. Theres no hidden gems here, just a VN thats so on the nose you may as well call it Pinocchio."

(Without the DLC)Artwork & BGM: 8/10The artwork is well drawn and shows alot about the places of interest and the music always fits the mood of the place you're visiting.Information On Places: 10/10This was the reason I bought the game in the first place which is to learn more about Japan and let's just say this VN (VisualNovel) was very accurate with that info.Storyline(PLOT): 10/10 (Why can't I give it higher than the max)The story follows you visiting Japan and staying with two cute girls who become your tour guides.You pick 3 places you wanna visit out of a total of 6 and while you visit and learn about the various places history and origins.You will find love with one of the two girls who you spent the most time with.There's a bonus trip to Kyoto and than you go though it all, reach the ending and feel sad that it ends but WAIT there's a bonus after the Credits so look out for that.Overall Rating: 9/10 ( GET THIS VN )Was quite pleased with this Vn very infomative and was fun to go though it...Really enjoyed the whole journey with both girls. The options were great like the Journey Diary entries , CG&Music gallery & Scenes replay which is on the main menu.Will write about the Go! Go! Nippon! 2015 DLC once I finish it...Just started and I already love the fact that it's more updated(You can change the currency to whatever you want) and the girls are 1000% cuter.THE GIRLS THEY MOVE AND IT'S SO FLAWLESS"

You get to choose what sight you want to visitOfc there will be a romance between the protagonist and one of the 2 girls.. i mean its a novel all right.  ^-^ (the side romance parts are actually pretty good)Pro:- Money system. At the start of the game you can add your value to yen price. (eg 1€ = 100000 yen or use realistic values like the current ones). When the protagonist spents money on sth it gets calculated in the end of the day.

All facts will be forgotten in a few minutes, guaranteed, tbqh I wouldn't even recommend trying to remember them. The two girls who ""show you Japan"" consist of a tsundere and a nee-san character archetypes.

Depends:If it's on sale and you're planning a trip to Japan --- Recommend, but be ready to stifle gag reflex at lots of the dialogueIf you're seeking an engaging gaming (or fapping) experience --- Do not recommendFor those who enjoy visual novels and super-cheesy awkward text.  Very nerdy love story meets tour guide.  Comes with a budget (subway, entry fares, and conversion to Yen) but does not include alcohol or cover costs, and you somehow only eat out 3 times on a week-long vacation, so it's orders of magnitude off.  But tour factor of Tokyo, Hoshinka, Osaka, and a few surrounding areas is not bad; shows a variety of attractions (social, cultural, historical) with a brief placard-style dialogue about each one.Requires two playthroughs to see all 6 attractions--which btw is how you ""pick"" the girl you like.  Each girl shows 3 sites...the girl who shows you more, is who you ""choose"" --- however the game does not indicate which girl shows which site.  But no matter which ones you choose, on two playthroughs you will see the ending of both girls, as long as you don't repeat.  One of the love stories I will grudgingly admit is cute.""Two cute Japanese girls whose parents are away for the week"" may sound like the start of a porno...but if you're expecting that, prepare for disappointment.  There are literally two still-shots with very minor states of undress (seriously 5 seconds on even the tamest hentai site would yield far more rewarding results there). Okay, so maybe you crave a classier approach involving no tentacles...but they don't wear anything remotely skimpy and do not change clothes EVER.  Both of them have only 3 body/facial expressions for any dialogue scenes (so, almost the entire game).TL/DR: If you've seen the six steam screenshots, you've seen almost as much of the girls as you will in the ~3 hours of content (depending on reading time).Bought it on sale as I'm planning on visiting Japan this year and definitely did find a few gems that I now want to see.

There is also NO SEX (H-scenes) at ALL, don't be mislead! If you want boobies and sex in your game, The Witcher series is a great first start. Snowdrop is also good choice.This game truely falls into the Visual Novel category, those looking for more ""interaction"" or choices that affect the outcome are going to be very disappointed. The lack of voice acting also put a damper on the experince. Its basically a well illustrated ""E-book""That being said this game does exactly what it says it would do, give you a ""guided tour"" of certain parts in Japan. However I must throw in that just a quick look on google will get you more images of the sites mentioned in this game. They could have done much more, there are many scenes in the game where you are looking at clouds, when they could be showing you just what is being talked about, or what is happening.The ""love sim"" aspect is basically non existant and seems rather thrown on at the end. Those looking for something along the lines of ""Snowdrop""(which is the only love sim I have really played) will also be disappointed. I am still not sure how you can chose a specific partner, I guess its the tourist destinations you chose that have an impact. To its credit the endings do pull at your heart strings, slightly but it does evoke some form of reaction, I doubt anyone is going to burst into tears (happy or sad) at the ends.I would give this game an 7.5/10 rating, it does what its meant to do and does it well, however its rather limited choices for player and interaction in general limit its replayability. I am certainly pleased with my purchase of this game but it could have done more than what it did, there was a lot of missed potential here but at its current price I cannot complain.

But the real problem is the dating system... unless you save before each choices of place to visit in Tokyo, you can't ""choose"" your own route, that's pretty much all you can do, you fall for the girl you hang out with most of the time.

I already knew a lot about nippon (from the animes and researches) but I really learned a lot from this game and not just culture, also valuable informations for my futur trip to japan ! ;-) The informations from the two cute girls is really interesting.

I have spent hours just wasting time with this game. You play a male character who, despite his life dream being travelling to Japan, has almost no knowledge of Japan or Japanese culture. It gets a little embarassing as he overreacts to things like ramen and trains, but if you can get through those there is a lot of historical information as well that I found interesting. It is not presented in a boring way either, was not too ""lecture"" like. Involves a kind of half-a**ed love story with your Japanese hosts, including a few gratuitous changing and nudity scenes, but the art is well done, the writing is easy to follow and flows pretty naturally.I bought this game on sale after playing Katawa Shoujo for like the fifth thime and needing a new VN to get my mind off of it. It is totally different from Katawa Shoujo, but well made, so that it kept me interested and entertained for a few short hours.I wouldn't pay more than a few dollars for it, I think I only paid 3, as it is short and not really involved. I love Visual Novels and reading sotries though, so while it was fun for me to pretend to be in Japan, if you are looking for interesting characters, or actual plot, go with a different game. If you just want to waste some time, have an interest in Japanese culture, or just feel like some cutesy graphics and a shallow-but-happy overall feeling, this game is pretty good."

,Not Recommended,251870,9266386,"Posted: 26 February, 2014",all,Hillard Rabe,"Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~is an unusual experiment that trades heavily on novelty but fails to leave a lasting impression.The game presents itself as a tourist guidebook-esque visual novel intended for English-speaking audiences--this being rather alien territory for the genre--with all the trappings of the genre. Indeed, the attractive (albeit limited) art, interface and scenario design are rooted in the traditions of the Japanese visual novel. Unforunately, the experience is too brief and the informational aspect too slim; the game falls short of both of its propositions.While the premise is intriguing, the characters are archetypal and the attempts at comedy and romance are tired and toneless. The main character--a foreigner homestaying with a pair of Japanese siblings--is merely a palette swap of the garden-variety protagonists found in lesser Japanese visual novels. His amorous leanings disappoint with their banal outcomes, and the girls fare no better. Makoto is a classical Japanese housewife-type whose prinicpal character flaw is an apparent inability to follow a recipe. Akira is a stand-offish, zesty younger sister whose conflicted romantic intentions toward the main character are too expected and textureless to muster any emotion in the player.The game scenario branches into two storylines focusing on either girl, though the player receives no warning of how the limited choices to be made over the course of the game lead to which unaffecting outcome. The overall narrative has a distinct back-patting tone when mention is made of various technologies employed throughout Tokyo. The protagonist's constant amazement of Japanese technological progress and paradisiacal protrayal of Japanese life should strike any player familiar with the reality of living in Japan as disingenuous and irresponsible.As a resource for would-be tourists, there is still more disappointment in store. The various guided tours of areas within Tokyo (and a few out-of-prefecture day trips) feel spartan and excessively-curated. Visits to points of interest within a given locale can be counted on one hand, and each day of the week's adventure ends before it seems to have begun. Wikipedia offers a more comprehensive study of the various neighborhoods of Tokyo than can be found in this game.The game allows for currency conversions for all transactions in the game, ostensibly to fascilitate budgeting for a similar trip, but the usefulness of the feature is destroyed by how many costs are overlooked. That the protagonist lodges with a Japanese family--at no cost to him, one must presume--disregards one of the most significant expenses of a trip to Japan. Sadly, the greater preoccupation of the scenario writer was clearly the trite romantic comedy woven between the educational passages.The music is servicable fare, limited to a handful of tunes that never become grating, if only due to the brevity of the game. Characters do not speak their lines, and aside from occasional sound effects, the background music is left to carry the scenes--a challenge far beyond its capacity.A small offering of bonus features becomes availabe at the end of the first playthrough, though these provide little incentive to return to the shopworn storyline.Fans of novelty and experimentation will find some redeeming qualities in whatGo! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~has accomplished, but anyone looking for a captivating narrative or a useful resource for planning a stay in Japan would be better served by almost anything else."

Google maps link is nice and innovative. Food sketches are rather pleasing however. The girls are nothing special and just serve to be usual cardboard cutout sisters recycled over and over as Japan is known famously for, the sweet heart kudere and the yandere.Writing - 5/10Does a good job of explaining Japan and it's culture. However there are some typos and some English saying's thrown in that serve no purpose and just seem completely off e.g. ""That's totally metal"". Don't come in expecting voice acting, because there is non! Furthermore the usual tropes are here that anyone would expect. It seems that all eastern women think western men think of nothing but engaging in sexual acts with anything that has a pulse. The gags are also terribly cringy and poorly implemented.Story - 5/10Sets out be a organised trip of Japan but ends up being more like an interactive propaganda video for Japan which isn't a problem in itself but this odd love narrative they try to string in is. It's all completely out of place considering they only did it to draw in a more pervese audience and give you a reason just to struggle through days if talking about Japanese history isn't you thing.Gameplay - 1/10What do you expect? Interactive slideshow. But if you like VN's then this is up your street.Feels - 8/10Characters grew on me like wart.Vodka's Overall Rank - 7/10Would only recommend to hardcore VN's lovers.

Lots of Japanese history of Tokyo and Kanto regions.Fear not it's also got 2 charming characters to keep you entertained. Though I found the younger sister (refraining from names simply to not spoil a minor detail) a bit cliche, Ironically I also liked her the most.The older sister seemed more realistic.It has some ecchi (not nudity just teaser stuff) scenes which at first took me out of the experience mainly because you get them rather early on, but I also felt the VN would have been a bit more boring without them...Well if you hate VN's or just the Japanese culture in general (I have no idea why you are here then) then this probably won't change your mind. If you tend to like VN's then keep in mind this will be more educational than others which you might find less fun.If you have an interest at all in learning the japanese culture and history it's great while also providing more entertainment than... well taking a class on Japanese =P."

As someone who visited Japan in the winter of 2010, I can say without a doubt that the game simulates the experience to a tee. In fact, one of my first experiences in Japan, and one of the earliest scenes in the game, was encountering the infamous “squirty” toilet, or a bidet as the locals call it. The first thing I do when I visit any hotel room is to examine the bathroom. I saw the toilet and was immediately awestruck by the array of buttons on a panel. I remember pressing a button with a water spout symbol, wondering what, if anything, would happen. And something happened indeed. From the middle of the toilet emerged a rod that sprayed water in an upward fashion: in the direction of my face. The experience was akin to drinking from a water fountain but much, much better, a truly wonderful sensation. Think of the hottest summer day in recent memory and remember uncapping that icy bottle of Poland Spring and pouring it all over yourself, no inhibition, nothing holding you back from such momentary release from the unrelenting heat. It was that good. I bring up this little anecdote because the game does that to you. It pulled from the deepest recesses of my memory the wonderful times I had in Japan. But it does something better. It brings you to Japan in the company of two girls  who host you in their own home. While I don’t remember much about the women in Japan, besides the Santa dressed girl who grimaced and said KYA! in my presence, I think it accurately portrays the inherent friendliness and outgoing nature of the Japanese people. Just make sure you have money and are willing to spend it. In this context, the game mirrors real Japan but removes the possibility of airsickness, hotel and food expenses, and arrest. Go! Live that long held off dream of visiting Japan and buy this game. You won't regret your first trip nor will your regret your next."

It is effective as an educational/informative tool to a point, but an actual guide book would be preferable as this is a somewhat limited and distracting format. At the least, some unfamiliar terms will be introduced, inviting further research on the part of the reader if they do want to make the investment of a trip to Japan later.As an edutainment game in VN form, it accomplishes what it sets out to do. The plot is fairly weak and often takes a back seat to informative anecdotes, though the love story threads are very complimentary to grasping particular aspects of the culture. The protagonist is enough of a massive dork to elicit entertainment value, ironically or otherwise.Production values, with regards to art and music, are all solid and with no major flaws. I question why the need was felt to include overt adult fanservice in this, as removing it would not affect the overall length in any major capacity.I ended up enjoying this more than anticipated and find it recommendable as its own product. If you're interested in the culture of Japan, or like visual novels in general, you'll enjoy this. That said, it's worth acknowledging that it's not the most effective guidebook by any stretch of the imagination, and further reading is recommended; it has been catered to the VN-reading audience as an introduction, nothing more."

Nippon!"" is, as it directly implies, a role-played week-long visit in Japan with 2 girls whose parents are away on business. As it indirectly implies, it's also a romantic, comic story with similar characteristics to an actual Japanese roleplaying game (which I haven't played; this game is great for beginners). It simply does not lack any details I've known about the genre (other than the lack of courses you can take, which is still plentiful for a newcomer to this game type).The game is very simple: click, read, click, read (the enter key and roller on the mouse can also be used to carry on conversation).  As yourself, enjoy your last moments on a plane, meeting the sisters, and planning your first visit. It's nice to have subtitles in Japanese and English beside each other, but I would've greatly appreciated a romanji inclusion (romanji is the word used to refer to Japanese sounds in english writing, and is itself an example: ro-ma-n-ji).I do hesitate, though, to try going for another run through the game for an alternate ending. The game contains at least 2 embarrassing images (maybe more that I'm unaware of) that seem an inevitable part of the story.Through the game, you'll have a constant urge to want the game to end romantically or sentimentally, but have a hunch that it's just a touring game and the anxious interactions are just a part of the ride.. well, since you can't decide what your character says, it's inevitable that he thinks the same way. He's a little less shy than I am, what with his courage at keeping doors open for several sentences at a time, but many of the things he says or thinks match my own thoughts pretty strongly, almost to a tee. There're still a couple thoughts of his I disagree with.I have yet to uncover the pattern in deciding places to go resulting in varying endings, but I probably took the route with the ending I would prefer the most."

Interactive manga?). I caved and got this particular example because I was under the impression that it would be educational since it basically sells itself as a virtual guide to Japan. I thought that I'd be getting a Japanese history and culture lesson, maybe learn a bit of the language.Nope, learned only one word in just over an hour. There's japanese subtitles for everything the girls say but no attempt to teach how to even read it.I also immediately noticed right off that the protagonist, and whose headspace you share for this experience, is pretty much a living otaku stereotype complete with cringe inducing dialogue and monologue. Oh my beloved Japan! Then it also becomes apparent that a ham fisted romance angle is just around the corner not even an hour into it when otaku!boy realizes that he staying with the two girls (one of whom may or may not be jail bait) with the parents gone for the duration.Lastly, for a visual novel, there's more telling then there is showing. I was expecting illistrations for everything, but so far just a few set pieces and the expectation that you use your imagination for everything. Which goes against the point of this VN I think. Guess most of the budget and time in this regard went into animating the girls.Also, the art for the main menu didn't exactly fill me with confidence for this. Just more Big Sis emphasising that, yes, she has big fun bags. And a Not!PantyShot from Sis the Younger.Last thing, for reals this time, I thought that there would be more decision making from myself in this game. Like branching paths to the overall story and, if any, sub-plots since you are going on a guided tour for over a week. But so far apart from deciding how much yen a USD is worth, Otaku!Boy is firmly in the drivers seat when it comes to actions and dialogue. Which is a shame because the protagonist doesn't feel like a actual person and it shows.This review may change if I can be bothered to pick up the game again later, to give it a second chance with the thought that it'll get better, but I doubt it to be honest. Too many red flags and stumbles before you even through the door."

It also has every line written in English and Japanese so you can brush up on your language skills, but it would have done much better with an inclusion of pronounciation for each line so you could learn the language if you aren't familiar.

(Warning: Spoilers about the linear beginning of the game only, incoming)Almost immediately at the start of the game you are told that your protagonist is going to stay a week in Japan, which to me instantly is a red flag. Seven days is not a lot of time for getting into the world and building relationships or for exploring the world.Ignoring that, as well as the fact our protagonist has a huge fetish for Japan (which is possible, so it's not a problem, but it's not my thing) you land safely at the airport, only to learn that he doesn't know if his chat-room-friends are coming to pick him up or not. (-2 planning skills or what?)He does not know their gender and he does not know how they look. I really feel this guy hardly know these girls at all and it just completely ruined my experience of the game. Phrases such as ""Did I just stumble into a stay with two girls?"" doesn't help that impression because of the word stumble.It's also really weird he never picked up they were girls or they never told him. This is possible, but seems unlikely.The list goes and on, including their lame excuse that their parents really wanted to meet him but are out of town.All responsible parents lets their girls be home alone with some guy they hardly know from anouther country... not.On a last negative note, it's also really weird that there is no dialogue during the train trip you go on immediately after landing.The game is not trash, but I would not recommend it to anyone."

But it's a visual novel where you can learn about Japan and fall in love with one of two girls. There are no real choices. The love story unfolds depending on locations you choose and at first you don't know how they affect the story or that they do at all.Despite these facts, i quite like the game and if you want to unlock all ""collectible"" pictures and scenes and fall in love with both girls, you can easily spent around 10h with this game. It's too expensive I think, but I enjoyed it.If you like visual novels and love stories, you can give it a try."

Supprised it took me 4hours to finish it though. I did enjoy this ( got so into the story that i never left my game for 5hours long on steam game record...)  .The visual are nice, although i wished they made it more ""Real"" feeling to it ( they never changed cloths except at samurai part). Also more visual animated with voice over audio would be greet ( Can learn japanese that way in writting, speaking and read :)  )Sometimes midway i had to keep search on google to understand what they meant. Like geisha,meiko,geiko etc.. provided some picture would be great to understand the story a bit more.In terms of dialog, sometimes i feel like they ""used wrong words"" when i read it and compared in that situation (from anime/manga) it doesn't seem right to use those lines. But I cannot be so sure since i cannot read/translate japanese text.Also they mark some lines in green to specify why they use those lines at that point, but they didn;t wrote the translation of it (i think most of the people already can guess what they mean already though).As this is my first ""Written down"" review, here are my scores:Visual: 7Audio(soundtrack & effects): 8Dialog (Text based):7Dialog (how they interact with each other): 9 => lots of funny parts where i had to laugh.User-friendly: 8.5 => guess most of the game of these type uses same method, so not a bad thing at all (although my first time playing such game, cause i wanted to know more about japanese)Recommendation: Yes, i do recommend it if you want to learn about Japan while enjoying a bit of comedy and love story to it.

Like Two-Three Hours short, mind you, this is only if you do one of the two paths.When it comes to visual novels this game really isn't doing anything new when it comes to plot or story. Though what it does nicely is introduce you to Japanese Culture.In a nutshell, you are going to Japan for the first time to meet up with two online friends, and from there your adventure starts! You get to tour all of Tokyo and bond with your two friends. Of course this can also lead to romance.At first, the plot and the character interaction seemed rather shallow, and I didn't really care what was happening. But as the story goes on you start to get connected with the characters. (Even if the game is rather short.) You'll start caring about them and want to know even more.To be honest, the game ended just when I was really starting to enjoy it.I don't think we'll see a follow up and that is a shame. Mind you, the game has been out for a few years. Overall though I did enjoy the game! If you like visual novels then I would recommend giving this one a shot, even if it is on the shorter side.If anything support these types of games so we can see more of them on Steam!"

The pay off at the end is none existant, and the whole game literally drags you by the hand, and slaps you if you want to do something else. The characters are basically blank sheets.

He makes friends with some Japanese people on the internet, and decides to stay with them for a week.Thrilled by the prospect of a week's sightseeing in Japan, he touches down in the airport, only to discover that his new friends -- ""Makoto"" and ""Akira"" -- are actually a pair of attractive young sisters!After their introductions, the protagonist arrives at their house to learn that no one else is there.""Um... where are your parents?""""Our parents were called out of town for two weeks on urgent business.""(In other words, the only ones in the house will be Makoto, Akira, and I?)(How is that going to work!?)The local culture has some surprises in store on your first night there, but you'll soon head out on the town! Enjoy the date-like atmosphere as Makoto and Akira take you on a tour of famous sites. You'll marvel at the beauty and history of Japanese culture, fill up on local delicacies, and even share some thrilling moments with the girls!The week you spend in Japan will certainly be memorable!Gameplay:First of all, imagine you are visiting Japan that you never been there before, meet the two lovely young sisters (Makoto and Akira), and seeing wierd stuff. You came to heaven. You feel like girls are attracting to you. Oh noes!Moving on, you are playing as a protagonist, which means you. There is no such thing as a gameplay. It's like Visual Novel or Manga you are reading on the computer. You interact things when you're about to make a choices. There are no right or wrong for this part of the story. It just focuses the plot of the story you are visiting in Japan places and culture.Review:Overall, I feel that this game seems to be like reading the book, imagining to have a relax or nothing to do. Even if I'm not visiting or in Japan, one day, I would go there sometimes (if I have enough money to travel. =P) I actually understand what I learn some Japanese culture, and language (a bit).

,Recommended,251870,18629433,"Posted: 22 October, 2015",all,JoshuaJSlone,"(Review based on original non-2015 version.)Pleasantly simple visual novel that seems either like a substitute for a vacation, or preparation for one.Your character travels to Tokyo for a week, staying with some people he met online--he thinks he's going to stay with brothers Makoto and Akira, but it turns out they're _sisters_ Makoto and Akira. They act as his guides, showing him how things work locally, such as how to use the train system and use Suica cards for payment. Choices are mostly limited to ""Which area of town should we visit today?"". You'll take a tour of the area, see some drawn images, learn a few facts and history of the place. A single playthrough lets you see half of these locations, so two playthroughs will let you see pretty much anything. It's easy to quickly skip through sections if you've seen them before. There is an extremely light bit of romance plot, which basically boils down to which of two people was your tour guide on more days, so two playthroughs covers both of those bases too.Another kind of neat thing is that since most of the time the conversations are supposed to be taking place in Japanese, it has the option of showing you the ""real"" text in a box above the English translation. Even if you know just a little of the language, it can sometimes be interesting to compare the two. It's also pretty funny that Akira's poor English skills are represented by katakana."

The two female leads do not have much depth, and are mostly there to serve as tour guides and shallow love interests. The overarching story of this being a short trip in Japan is mostly just there to give you reason as a player to be going to these varied locations and, like the two female leads, only offers a shallow amount of depth.  Moving onto the games art, it is good. The characters have appealing designs and the environments look nice. The games music is also enjoyable, fairly generic but enjoyable. Each of the areas has ambient sounds which help do wonders to the emersion. As for the gameplay, the games visual novel style controls work well, though it’s hard to mess up saving and loading features..... The game offers a fair amount of information about the places you visit and even has a button that you can press to see a google maps image of the real life area. To me this was the highlight of the game because the game does offer more or less an abridged history lesson about the areas that you visit. The game does a good job of making you feel like you are in fact getting a tour and the games inclusion of background noise adds greatly to this. The biggest flaw that the game has is the length. The game is only about 2 hours long to get one of the endings and is about another 30 mins if you want to get the alternative ending, if you skip through previously viewed dialogue. This game will appeal to a somewhat small audience but those who find the idea of touring Japan with anime girls will not be disappointed."

Honestly, it's a bit refreshing to see Tokyo not smashed to pieces by Godzilla, aliens, demons, ghosts, vampires, or giant robots.It's a bit short, but it doesn't wear out its welcome. Sure, you don't get to see everything the first time through, but that happens when you travel.

While it has two scenes of fan service, this game is primarily about a foreigner who comes to Japan and has two sisters showing him around.There is replay factor in the sense that you won't visit all locations during the first play through, so if you want to open up all the other artwork, you will need to play it again for the second time.Also, choosing the cities and making sure who introduces you to locations the most, will determine whether you will be with older sister Motoko or younger sister Akira.But overall, I enjoyed this game for it's dialogue and while I wouldn't call this an educational game, it is educational but in a more fun and perverted way.It's simple, straightforward and an entertaining visual novel about one going to Japan for the very first time and learning key facts about various locations around Tokyo.Recommended!"

,Not Recommended,251870,14537714,"Posted: 18 February, 2015",all,すみか,"Overview:Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ is an OELVN (Original English Language Visual Novel) developed by Overdrive exclusively for western audiances.  Think of it as a tour of Japan wrapped in a short but occasionally sweet story.  Is this trip worth your time?  Short answer: Not unless you're really interested in learning about Japan.Story:Go! Go! Nippon! is not a particularly long Visual Novel but it is full of information.  And that is the main draw.  The story itself, while occasionally sweet, is filled to the brim with annoying and tired tropes and falls firmly in the weebo pandering category.  I don't think it does these things in mean spirit but I personally found it annoying.  You assume the role of nameless (and basically faceless in the two or three CGs you are visable in) western otaku who finally gets to make his dreams come true and visit Japan.  He makes friends with some folks on the internet and plans to stay with them.   Of course, once he gets off the plane and meets his kind hosts, he discovers they're two cute sisters, Makoto and Akira.  Oh, and of course their parents are going to be out of town for the duration of your visit.  Let the pandering begin.The rest of the story takes place over the week you spend in Japan.  You will need to play through the game twice to see both endings and cover all of the locations you can visit.  Makoto and Akira will take you on a tour through Tokyo, visiting places like Shinjuku, Akihabara, and some other areas of Japan like Kyoto.  For the main six locations each girl will be associated with three.  After visiting three locations you will take a joint trip to Kyoto and then have the ending location.  The girl you end up spending the most time with during your trip will give you her unique ending.  Credits will roll and you get a little epilogue.The character arcs are sweet but very predictable and shallow.  The real appeal in the story is actually touring Japan.  There is a lot of interesting facts and history to take in as you get a brief glimpse of life in Japan.Visuals:The art is hit and miss, sprites are well done but not varied enough for my tastes while the backgrounds and locations are pretty lackluster.  There are only a handful of actual CGs in the game but the few that are included are very well done.Sound Design:The soundtrack is acceptable, some of the tracks actually being pretty good.  There is no voice acting.System:From a technical standpoint the visual novel is...functional.  The font is readable, the Options are standard, and you get the usual Extra features such as the CG Gallery and Scene Gallery.  One interesting thing is that the game does feature both English and Japanese in the text box.  It doesn't add a lot to the game unless you're already in the process of learning Japanese and thus gives you some stuff to practice with.Conclusion:Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ is interesting at times but very middle of the road as a whole.  I think for people that want to know more about Japan and the culture it might be worth their time.  For anyone else, it is a lot harder to recommend."

I'm only at the third day but so far it has been pretty good, it made me want to go to Japan more than I already wanted, and gave me a small story to be invested in.My Conclusion:If you're into the whole visual novel thing and want to know more about Japan (Tokyo specifically), while you also want a story that gives it a good atmosphere... Then buy it!"

,Recommended,251870,9709272,"Posted: 2 April, 2014",all,Bell,"Games have always had the ability to educate and bridge cultural gaps but I’ve never encountered a game that specifically tried to culturally educate. Through the language of moè anime and visual novels Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ attempts to educate the player about what a real trip to Japan might entail. The big question is whether the language they are using will get in the way of that educational potential.The game opens with our hero (you!) not being able to get any sleep on the plane. At the airport he is greeted by two beautiful young women who will serve as his friends and tour guides throughout his trip. The dialogue, character tropes and story contrivances will be pretty familiar to anyone who’s watched an anime romance or played another dating focused visual novel.The gameplay choices are pretty light, even by visual novel standards. You choose which districts of Tokyo to visit which determines which of the two girls you’ll spend your time with which determines the ending you’ll get. Production values are average. The still pictures are well drawn, however, a few times you’ll be forced to look at a picture of sky and imagine what should be happening. If you’re looking for a lot of branching paths, higher production values or even just a fleshed out plot you’ll have to look elsewhere.Still, the trips themselves are enjoyable. Having the vocabulary and activities that make up a trip to Japan explained through two characters interacting is much more fun than reading a guidebook. The information is nicely highlighted and kept in a sightseeing album available from the main menu. The amount of money each activity costs being displayed in American dollars or Euros at the top of the screen (provided you have put in the exchange rate at the beginning of the game) helps make the information easy to digest. Speaking as someone who’s visited Japan before this was a nice review of activities I might enjoy again or I missed the first time.While the medium of a visual novel will attract otaku and people already interested in Japan, the medium’s quirks will probably turn off anyone else. Some scenes, particularly the ecchi (or sexual, perverted) scenes, seem like they’re pandering to their audience. Even though the game is short (about an hour a half for the first playthrough) it still feels like some things could have been left on the cutting room floor.Despite these problems I can’t help but come away liking Go! Go! Nippon! I not only had a good time but I learned something too. That’s not always something I can say for games. If you’re looking for a short little excursion to a foreign culture from the comfort of your computer give Go! Go! Nippon! a look."

Well, after playing it for the first time, I got stuck at the menu screen for 1 hour then after that I played it the second time and spent another 2 hours at the menu screen. This VN is not so hard to replay IMHO compared to others like Katawa Shoujo (It's just too hard to replay for me after playing it one time).

I played this VN with some friends and we had a good time poking fun of the protagonist, that has apparently always dreamed of going to Japan, but somehow has no grasp of Japanese culture, or even what life in a small city, let alone Tokyo, is like.  We had fun trying to figure out where he could have grown up as he was shocked by things like 24 hour convenience stores.The dating sim part of this game is largely up to chance, and there are not very many impacting choices throughout the game.   We ended up with Akira, but I would have liked to have had more choice in that, even if it was as simple as being able to choose which girl you to with to which location.Overall, not a bad VN, but not a good one either.

The novel is 1/2 story and 1/2 information with a sightseeing backdrop. There are extremely few choices, and it's advised to save before you choose your first destination, else be forced to click through the lengthy prologue again just so you can check out the other three options, as all 6 destinations can't be visited in a single playthrough. Even if you save immediately after the prologue, you'll still have to cycle through the joint destination before being given one of the two final destinations.The details given while sightseeing are interesting- different history and cultural elements. That's this novel's real strength. The story, on the other hand, is fairly bland, and almost seems like it was written by an overly-emotional pre-teen with little concept of how people interact. The parts that seem to have more thought put into them, as few as they are, tend to be drowned out by obvious railroading down a predictably forced plot and quickly forgotten. There are a couple points in the plot that try to be controversial but fall flat due to the intended audience being younger, so they feel needlessly preachy and feel rife with projection. Further, it's difficult to connect with the protagonist, which is supposed to be you, since so much of ""your"" dialogue comes from an easily excitable 13-year-old who is supposed to be somewhere between 17-21.Overall, I'd recommend this for a much younger demographic, the lower end of the T-rated spectrum, although parts will still seem contrived to them. As for people 18+, the only real reason to get it would be for the info on a couple tourism hotspots in Japan you might not of thought of visiting if you made the trip, but that really only pays off if you aren't already into researching Japanese culture, history, etc."

They're funny and one is more or less the typical Anime girl but as of now, nothing really interesting besides being eye candy and the other is a good character with good development and interesting characteristics, she is insanely cute too!However I think the main argument is that, I will say, is not a game.

You can choose where you go every day and you can choose some other minior things.So, to start off. This was my first dateing sim (if you don't count the random ones i played on Newground when i was 10) and i wasn't really expecting much honestly. The artstyle looked decent, but other than that i really didn't think there was gonna be much interaction or anything (since it isn't on a PSP or other handhelds)And as i assumed i was right! There were not many things you could influence! It was basicaly just a story with some pictures.So why am recommending this?Because for some reason it was interesting. The player didn't have much choice, other than where he wants to go visit and what food he wants to eat, but it was really interestign to learn about Japan with this game. Maby it's just because i love Japan already and that's why i could enjoy this so much, but non the less it was really a fun trip to Japan in a way. You could learn a lot about Japanease culture, the citys and ofcourse FOOD! Th game also didn't have any nudity and only had two shots with the girls half-naked. (which is a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on the person ofcourse)The end would basicaly depend on how many times you went to visit with one of the girls and that girl fell in love with you (much like in anime and manga).The endings weren't anything spectacular but they did have some inpact on me at the end.Overall here are my +/- about the game:++++~Really good english translations (if it was translated atall. Don't really know this)~Works as a actual tour guide for someone who wants to know more about japan~Almoast no perversity (good thing for me, maby not so good for you other perverts out there ;) )~Has nice relaxing music------~Not much choice or inpact on the games ending~Not much replayability (basicaly it just takes 2 times to get all the pictures and info about towns, and the two endings)~I might be a cheep♥♥♥♥♥ but 9.00 Euro for this is way too high in my opinion.Overall verdict:Buy this game if you want to relax from your daily life, learn a bit about japan, it's history and culture, without wikipedia and with two cute anime girls as your guides.But i do suggest you get it on a sale since i don't think it's worth 9.00 Euro honestly.My score:  6,5/10"

Mostly the game is just a game about you learning more about Japan lol. I don't really understand why the game needed to do those two perverted scenes when the whole game is like super PG-rated. It could have done well without them in my personal opinion ( coming from a person that thinks the number 69 is funny when a teacher says it lol).* If you looking for a ecchi type visual novel this is something you wouldn't really be into... trust me lol!* If you want to learn more about Japan while being able to be tought by two adorable girls you might love this game.* I Suggest buying this when this on sale cause it's only about four hours and it's just facts you could find on Google lol.

This focus means there are, for example, some plot points that may seem contrived but serve as opportunity to explain certain aspects of life in Tokyo (e.g. SUICA cards and konbini).However, if evaluated based on its design objective (part VN, part ""guided tour""), I think it's good.

You get a bunch of information about locations along with some basic human decency tips.Here is a typical (somewhat sarcastic) rundown of most parts:Girl: This is a tree.You: Wow!Girl: *More Information*You: WOWWWWWW!Girl: Also, this is what you do at said tree.You: OH MY GAWD JAPZ IS ADVANCED AND 'MURICA SUX!This game is perfect for weebs who want to sound convincing, but beyond that, really isn't worth more than a dollar."

It also has a good story, although I got it to learn more about Japanese culture I enjoyed the story. This is definitely worth getting if you are interested in Japan and want to go there one day."

,Recommended,251870,21650404,"Posted: 5 March, 2016",all,The Late Gatsby,"NOTE: January 12, 2017.  I've changed my mind about this game -I've played more visual novels and concluded this is actually a great title for the genre.  I guess I""m really not a visual novel guy.  I've preserved my original review, just... yeah, if you dig visual novels, go for it.I wanted to like this game, I really did.  I actually even replayed it to make sure I saw more areas.  But... it's kinda dull.  There isn't much by way of visuals -you see a few pictures of places, with maybe three ""splash pages"".It isn't without its good points!  The lewdness is kept to a minimum- I hear that VNs are usually full of ridiculous ecchi content, so I'm okay with less of it.  If you've got a dirty mind, just walk away -and keep your hands where I can see them.  It is also kind of a ""Baby's first guide to Japan"", you learn a few things about how you can get around Japan and some basic etiquette.  Of course, if you just read a blog written by someone who's been there, or perhaps even read a book, you'd get the same information and more.I would not recommend this game, as you would be better off reading a real guidebook.  If this game were more informative, it would be a splendid virtual tour, but that would be dull for most VN fans."

It's very imersive, you can feel the main character's wonder and excitement about Japan, even more if you're an otaku like many people playing this game are.  ^_^ and akira and makoto are SO SO CUTE~ the developer is great too, thanks for an awesome story. but i wish it had 1080p support BAI~"
