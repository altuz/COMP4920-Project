What they promised years ago was to deliver a randomly generated, open world diving simulator with unparalleled realism, graphics, and gameplay.  What they have delivered over the past couple of years is a completely unstable, unplayable fantasy game with built-in monetization and in-game purchases, with small and broken maps.  Their screenshots DO NOT match the actual gameplay.  When the game used to work, it was a multiplayer gameplay clone of Depth Hunter 2: Deep Drive, a decent if barren clone.Starting in November 2014, World of Diving has become the culmination of false promises of progress, game-breaking bugs, eye-splitting visual glitches, dysfunctional online servers (used for authentication and multiplayer), a failed and forced migration to Unity 5, and a game with a backward-moving progress bar...all which make for a very angry user community.  But alas, you can help!  They request additional cash donations on their website in return for future updates.To add insult to injury, updates are so broken, you are sometimes forced to redownload the previous (and still broken) version.  Each update is roughly 2GB in size.  Each is released with ""new features"" that no one asked for or wanted, and introduces new glitches while none of the on-going game-breaking bugs seem to get fixed.  There is something called Quality Assurance and Testing, which shouldn't be confused with a Beta Community. It's all very frustrating.So this kind of business practice doesn't work for very long, and word has gotten out.  Now, this multiplayer game has literally nigh zero players, new or old (http://steamcharts.com/app/251890#All), the money stream has run dry, and Vertigo Games has already repurposed many of their developers to work on other projects.In the summer of 2015, after years of retail availability as a playable and ever-improving Beta, Vertigo Games demoted World of Diving from Beta to Alpha on the Official World of Diving Website (with no communication about that on Steam).  It has become that broken now.After over a year on Steam, in an endless spiral of worse update after worse update, it's amazing that this kind of baitware can still be sold to new, unsuspecting consumers. How Vertigo Games goes about their business is atrocious and offencive, and they should all be very ashamed of taking advantage of their early adopters and taking thousands of dollars in ""donations"" for false deliverables, and finally, for providing such a HORRIBLE Early Access experience.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME/DEVELOPER AND WARN YOUR FRIENDS.I ask that you please rate this up."
,Not Recommended,251890,18406342,"Posted: 9 October, 2015",all,nuffy,"I bought this game last december, at the same time I bought Subnautica. I usually wait a year to review early access games. Thats the amount of time I think is fair unless I find the actions of a developer particularly frustrating and/or disgusting.Back then Subnautica had so little content there wasn't even a save feature. This game had content, and I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the Bismarck, but there were a few areas that said ""this area isnt available yet"" because it was still in development.I didn't touch this game for nearly a year and just recently reinstalled it. Low and behold, there's nothing new besides a map with visual fidelity far, FAR worse than the others, and those undeveloped areas are still off limits.Meanwhile look at Subnautica. The amount of content added in just a year is staggering.As far as I'm concerned this game is abandoned. I was able to ignore the always online, the microtransactions. The stupid XP system, and the lack of content because its early access. But it's been almost a year and there's basically nothing to show for it.I LOVE diving. I love the ocean. I love sailing. I love everything water themed. But this game is a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥To sum it all up:Almost no noteable changes.Pathetic options menu (you cant even turn off the in game music to play your own)You can see everything there is to see in about 2-3 hours.You can customize your character, but expect to either need to play the game every day and grind for dozens of hours, or purchase microtransactions.Graphics seemed to have downgraded since the last time I played.Nothing to really do, levels are boring, tiny and incomplete, and missions are laughable.The 30 or so minutes I played checking up on this game I spent wondering what could have been. The Bismarck alone could support a dozen hours of exploration, salvage and history. And it's really sad that this didnt get explored, and there seems to be no intention of it.If you love the ocean and exploration as much as me then get Sunless Sea/Subnautica instead. Don't waste money on this.UPDATE 3/5/2016No devblogs or update in monthsSeems they've finally stopped pretending. No new developer blogs of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ photoshop renders that will never be added."

This used to get regular updates, but after the devs updated to Unity 5, and ran into some snags, it seems they are now more interesting on working on a new VR game than actually finishing this one. I recommend that you avoid this game for the time being."

Graphically, it's quite beautiful.  The undersea world is rendered with appropriate murkiness; fish and dolphins flit about, sharks glide menacingly overhead, and shipwrecks look suitably weathered.But that's about where it ends for me.  As nice as it looks, the ocean in World of Diving seems too static and artificial.  The fauna just swim about without much regard for the player.  The undersea wrecks are impressive, but non-interactive.  It looks real, but it doesn't feel real.In fact, the only undersea interactivity is in the form of contrived ""challenges"" or hunting for coins or pearls.  Those elements don't really fit with the more realistic presentation.  It's like the developers are attempting to shoehorn a game into a simulation.  The result ends up jarring; I was simultaneously immersed in a wondrous environment and yet constantly reminded that I am playing a video game.My recommendation would be to allow an option to ditch the more obvious ""game"" like elements in favor of a more immersive experience with better interaction with the undersea world.Updated August 15/2015:Since my original review, I've been following the game's development hoping it would get better with time.  Unfortunately, it hasn't.A few months back the developers migrated from Unity 4 to Unity 5.  The upgrade took several months and introduced a host of bugs and graphical issues with it.  Despite the engine upgrade, the game feels like it's taken a step back particularly with the water graphics.The game's popularity has also dwindled, with typically no more than a couple people playing at any given time.  For a game that boasts multiplayer, not having any players renders that feature moot.  Add on periodic server connection issues and you have a situation that doesn't seem too optimistic.The developers also revealed a roadmap of future game features, but other than improved fish AI, there isn't much to get excited about on that list.  Anyone looking for a more hardcore diving simulator is going to walk away disappointed.This game is simply not worth the money and the way it is being developed, probably won't ever be.  Pick up Subnautica instead.  It's a much better underwater game."

If you like diving, this is a game for you. It's beautiful, all the fish, wrecks, corals and plants will make you glad to have an in-game camera to catch it all on. You can swim around with friends and together explore what the ocean holds. There are many pretty cosmetic enhancements that you can buy even without mini-transactions, by collecting pearls and dubloons yourself. Missions can be made by community, just like maps in workshop. The developers listen and answer to the feedback on forums very frequently which makes my heart sing. It's full of bugs and floating rocks but keep in mind it's still in pre-alpha.

I don’t know whether there has been an update prior to my purchase as I have not experienced the problems other users have. The only slight glitch I have had is that the camera wobbles from time to time but it quickly goes and this has not impacted my ability to play it.I have only played the single player game so far but from what I have played so far I have really enjoyed! Maybe it’s because I am a diver myself but I have found the attention to detail excellent! Everything about the ‘gear’ is spot on and even the posters on the beach shop have the phase ‘plan the dive, dive the plan’ which are indeed one of the golden rules of diving.This is a slow but relaxing game; you are swimming around looking at fish, collecting treasure and getting rid of rubbish and I have found it a calming game.

Here I am going to tell you the pros, cons, and things that I think you should add to make the game even better!!Pros:~The graphics are amazing, and the water is a real amount of murky when it needs to be.~The camera feature is amazing, and the pictures that are taken are breath taking.~The camera feature allows you to take a ""selfie"" with the wreck or something.~The looks of the sharks, dolphins, and fish are beautiful!~The wrecks of the ships look so realistic!~The custimazation is plentiful.~The buddy thing is adorable, and I can't wait to get enough to buy one.~The hand signals are super accurate.Cons:~A bit laggy at some points, mainly with the multiplayer.~Requires a secondary login, which some people hate. (I was okay with it, and I think it was totally worth it)~Whilst it is meant to be a relaxing game, the murky waters can make it a little scary for more anxious people.Advice to make the game better:~Whilst it may be meant to be a relaxing game, i think it would be better to add more territorial and vicious creatures.~Caves that you could swim in and find money would be cool.~A selling feature so that you could sell your pearls and other stuff.~Collectable items that you could collect, sell, and get information on.~A book that you can access while playing in the menu or something to give you information on the wreck and the creatures you can find.~Being able to walk on the beaches and set up a camp.~To go along with the above feature, there should be a fishing feature to let you spear fish and stuff to get and cook food just for fun.That's all for me, and I hope that this helped you if you were considering to buy it.

,Not Recommended,251890,18672517,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,Cattail,"Update 13.10.2016A year has passed and it's time to see whats new. This time i can say that there have been some changes! A mission structure has been added. No longer can you start new levels from the menu before enough tasks has been completed in the previous. It took about an hour to complete the tasks in tutorial level, before another map opened. These tasks are the worst kind of fetch quests that make you go from A to B and back to A so much, that i wrote my notes while playing with the other hand. This also speaks about how much input the swimming requires. I had to force myself to complete it. There are still ""Coming soon"" notes around but not as much. Maybe it's because most of the content is no longer available from the start and i'll never waste the time required to open the later levels.A load of collectables have been added to the levels. In the tutorial alone, there are 118 pieces of treasures, 8 pearls and 271 pieces of trash. I collected a total of about 90 while playing and was rewarded with nothing. The collectables make no sense anyway, since they are mostly the same and placed seemingly at random.Camera has been changed from DSLR type to a tablet style device. This brings needless issues with the UI since the device also acts as main menu, mission list etc and it's hard to land on the thing you want. You can no longer leave the camera floating and take selfies with it, which was one of my favourite things a year ago. I cant remember if zooming and other things were in the game a year ago, but they are no longer. The camera in it's current state is really limited.The game runs fine now even at highest settings but the terrain twists and bends as the player gets closer and more detail is added. This seems really odd since the draw distance is really low underwater anyway and even at it's best World of Diving looks dated. Currently the game has no shadows anywhere. Not just real time shadows, even the pre-calculated shadows of stationary objects are missing. This makes the game look really flat and dull.Fishes react to the player but not as creatures with AI. Instead a magical force pushes them away from the player without any regard to the direction the fish was facing. Also they have no problems swimming through rocks. It looks hilarious when a fish is suddenly pulled away sideways and the look on it face is just as baffled as is the players.Character customization has new gear again, but they don't seem to affect gameplay. What is the point of adding a weight belt when it has no impact on swimming? Also the gear is bugged and with a classic helmet (think big daddies from bioshock) obscures the pictures taken with camera, but not your view while swimming. Even without special gear, swimming backwards in an angle let's you see inside the divers face.Options are as bare bones as they were a year ago. No control mapping, no sound options etc. Now there is an option to 3d print your character, which is nice i guess. The game also supports VR but since i don't have the gear, i wasn't able to test it.My recommendation from year ago still stands but now i can say that World of diving is a work in progress with some progress. Forwards or backwards is whole another thing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review 25.10.2015World of Diving has a great idea: It let's you dive in realistic setting and around interesting landmarks like the wreck of Bismarck. Unfortunately in it's current state idea is the only thing it has.Biggest issue is that there has been very little progress since i bought this game a year ago. Wreck of Bismarck is a key selling point for this game. What happens when you try to dive under deck? ""This area is not available yet"". Some oysters you can open and find pearls inside, others just say ""This oyster requires a tool to open (coming soon)"". These two things you will see just after five minutes of gameplay and it has been like this for a year. So what has changed during the year? Framerate is much better than what it was a while ago. There are new diving suits. Also there is one new map which is different from the rest in it's setting and is kind of interesting.Graphics are just not good enough for this kind of game. This game needs a lot of work with light and shadow for it to have any kind of mood or atmosphere. For example your flashlight only lights but doesn't create shadows. Also, darkness really isn't dark: You will have no problems seeing inside a shipwreck with no natural light or flashlight. Those places should be pitch black! Movement does not kick up dust or anything like that, which would also be nice. Atleast in it's current state it runs well.The maps are quite boring aswell. For example you can dive inside some shipwrecks and in it are okay looking walls and maybe something like a torpedo bay but all the little things are missing. This means all signs that someone has lived there: No tools, no tin cans, no bottles, no cutlery, no clothes, nothing. The places are just empty shells. Real joy of i guess diving but atleast exploring lost places is the little stories that your mind creates from all of the items and their relations to places. Nothing like that is in this game. This also makes the photography part of the game meaningless since you can't create stories with it either.Options for graphics and such are just not there either. Can you adjust brightness? No. Can you adjust sound levels? No. Can you change key bindings? No.At the time of this review World of Diving is still very much a work in progress with little signs of progress. If you are interested, wait. Do not buy yet.

Why? because it's so damned chill. I have never been more relaxed playing a game than i have this title. You create a diver and carry out missions. That's the gist of it. But the presentation is what kills it. The graphics are very smooth looking and you really feel as though you are diving somewhere in the pacific with not a care in the world other than making sure your camera is ready to take those snaps when you need to.The developer and community mission makers take care of the rest. You can customize your diver with cool bling as well. I was getting so relaxed i had to make a cup of java to keep my eyes open and that wasn't because i was bored. I was quite content to just swim around and check out the many species of fish that populate each map. Well worth the money. I can just imagine how awesome this game is going to be when it's finished. 5 out of 5 stars, without reservation."

The game's animation is not bad, kinda original, the game can be glitched in quite easily done ways, and the story, quests, and overall idea is played out pretty fast, easily boring. There is no actual story in my opinion, while the quests are great, they're just repeating sometimes, for example: You must take pictuers of certain animals, which is done multiple times and is boring to a high extent, thus making it less fun. When it comes to the animals and seas to explore, the animals are good, just not that many, out of the infinite amount of life, they choose such original and normal animals, making it less creative. The seas are animated and detailed well, just they are plain other than the animals and occasional ships and wrecks you find. In my opinion, this is one of the more glitchy ocean exploring games I have seen, you can glitch into stuff, and many things don't work, atleast the way you want them to. Last is, this game is confusing, in the beginning I had no idea what was going on, no idea what to do, how to build tubes, the main place you spawn is just confusing, it needs better explaining, it's just a slightly modified version of a lot of ocean dive games, DEPTH, Subnautica, etc."

This game is a fulfillment of that kind of promise personal computers had. My memory isn't perfect, but if I didn't hear someone longingly talk of someday being able to ""explore underwater worlds"" once, then it's only because I heard it more than once. And here we are; the future has become the present.I love aquatic biomes and the ability to visit one so detailed as this when I'm unable to do so in real life is something I adore having. The diversity of life you find in the waters of World of Diving necessarily doesn't equal what you'd see in an actual ocean, but there is enough variety that it stays interesting. As far as the fish go, they're so impressively detailed that you can easily tell their species at a glance if you know them in real life. And their behavior seems to differ slightly by species, as well.The sunken ships and the like are interesting and seem to be very well done. Those aren't as interesting to me as natural formations and flora and fauna, so I can't say much more than that about them. Well, I do remember that as I went through one sunken ship looking for Jack-o-Lanterns around Halloween, I remarked that the ship itself was a horror movie waiting to happen. Spooky. These sunken ships (and one plane, I believe) are often the hub or target of some of the available missions.This is such a beautiful experience and if you came looking at it with any hint of interest in the first place, you couldn't go wrong with it."

76561198097632017,Recommended,251890,33632950,Posted: 18 July,all,Suntrooper,"All the controverse about this game made me write this review, and honestly, it is difficult to rate this game. There's a lot good about it, but I do get the point of the negative reviews. Here comes my opinion.Short verdict: I play this game mostly in VR mode and I really like the immersion you get. The Oculus touch controls work really well and after I switched to them from a controller, I don't get VR sickness anymore. I like to relax underwater doing some (actually really stupid) tasks, that give me at least some reason to play this game aside from any sandbox play.I know, content is not huge, I know there are some technical issues and some game design aspects are just not up to date to current games, but I have fun with this game, though, and really enjoy the experience of the diving itself. Sadly, this game could be so much more, but thats the way it is.The long version:Currently, there are just few diving games out there, I think the only ones worth mentioning are this game, Subnautica and Endless Ocean 2 (only available on Wii). The latter one is a really great game and I played for over 70 hours and it is also either loved or hated but nearly nothing in between. If steam offered Endless Ocean 2 with good graphics, I would not need any other diving games, frankly said.So what do I expect from a diving game? First and most important, some underwater immersion created by authentic visuals and the simple sound of muffled breathing. The fascination of some colorful flora and fauna in diverse environments, which I can experience. The mix of solitude as a mere spectator but also a living environment.This is essentially what I like about WOD: The graphics are likable, there are different beings and some different environments (I hope it gets polar map, too, sometime in the future) AND especially in VR you get a good feeling of underwater immersion. IMO, it's relaxing to dive at the different locations and I enjoy exploring them and watching some fishes.In the end, I want to relax, but that must not mean that I get bored! This leads to...Second: I expect some tasks. In this games, the tasks are ... well ... okay. Take some fotos of this, collect that... just simple reasons to get underwater. It's  shallow, but its ok. I get more from this than I get from Subnautica. In Subnautica, you have to explore and survive, simple sandbox concept. Even though I love Subnauticas colorful look, thats nothing that keeps me playing. I prefer concrete tasks, even if they are quite stupid. I would've prefered a real storyline like in Endless Ocean 2,  but this game is far from that.I like it that there is no fighting and shooting in this game, that definitely helps with point 1 I mentioned above.Third and last, the game should have a smooth gameplay and shouldnt have a lot of bugs. Sadly, the game has some issues. Sometimes fishes glitch, sometimes the game begins to stutter, sometimes you bug though walls, fishes act as if you weren't there... Then there is no voice acting, the way you have to accept tasks again at some random point after you got them from Mr. Jamaika-Man is really confusing... The list goes on. It is nothing that completely destroy the game, but I think this is where all the bad reviews largely come from.Additionally, it is not clear in which way this game is still in development, leaving EA... there were, lets say ""regular"" updates, but seldom something big. I dont think there will be a lot of content added in the future.It is a really flawed and lacking game with some good essence after all: The feeling of being underwater at nice locations that you can experience with good VR controls."

(You had to do this in order to unlock the access to the rest of the game). I quit because it seemed rather stupid to lock the main game if you couldn`t complete this mandatory (and quite pointless) task. I got bored because I could not progress, but I figured that the game was in early release and would improve so I`d come back to it.Seems I was wrong. It`s exactly the same.This time I forced myself to swim around in circles endlessly until I had found and photographed all the flipping star fishes, persuaded 3 angel fish to hold still long enough to occupy a single picture (another mandatory task), and THEN... discovered an exit from the underwater glass tube... Yippee! (I thought...), I had entered the main environment/game.After swimming around for a while I came to the following conclusion:- ""Ray"" (the scuba shop/island paradise proprieter), needs sacking.If what I saw is a representation of a tropical paradise then I`m quite glad I live in suburbia because Rays island and reef is RANK.It`s disgusting...Bin bags full of god knows what, (Bodies? - drowning kittens? old picnic`s?), everywhere , empty bottles, old gas cannisters, oil drums, spent batteries etc.After swimming and walking around for ages and picking up over 50 pieces of trash I`d seen enough (especially after seeing my ""statistics"" which reliably informed me there were hundreds MORE pieces of trash to pick up....I decided that this game should really be re-named ""ocean trash hunt"" as that seems to be all you have to do in it.Sooooo..Uninstalled again... and still not recommended.Edit No 2:-I have just bought an Oculus rift and having tried this title in the VR mode I can say that the experience is pretty cool...... however, (and theres always a however with this game it seems) I cannot imagine the level of incompetence that enabled whoever wrote the code for the Touch controllers to (wait for it....)   get the hands back to front. Yep, you heard me right, the left hand is attached to the right controller, and the right hand to the left.This game could have been SO much more, its a crying shame that its in the current state,  I`m trying my best to see how they thought that depicting hundreds of bin bags full of rubbish, petrol cans, old gas canisters and aerosols everywhere was going to add to the games aesthetic qualities.Fish, yes, Octopus, yes, MERMAIDS , oh freaking YES.Bin bags   NO.BTW.  if you want to see an underwater game done RIGHT, - grab Abzu, it`s a million miles ahead of this."

The dev team tried to rush things because of that and the result was catastrophic. They came with a half finished adaptation of their game on the new game engine they worked on. Half demonstration, half game. It was a fail. Now they work on their own pace and build up the game again and the half game is becoming a whole game again, slowly.Indeed this project will not be finished in 2015. They have a todo list untill may 2016 at least.So : I strongnly advise NOT to buy this game now if you want a finished game. It is permanently changing and you will always be disappointed. The project is great and a lot of ideas already came through, but a lot didn't, some has been cancelled, or at least frozen. Other has been worked hard and are almost finished and results can already be seen.Anyhow, buy this game in early access only if you have strong backbone and wishes to see a game in developpement with a lot of broken features. Wait for the final release if you wish a brand new polished game : the dev team showed they were able to create a fine working game... They could, so they still can.But be honest with yourself before you buy it. This game is not expensive : $20 at the moment I am writing this review.

If you were expecting anything along the lines of Far Sky or an action-style type of game, then you will be dissappointed, as World of Diving is literally an underwater exploration game.  And it's pretty good for what it is.World of Diving's gameplay is very limited.  You can explore the sea, explore the wrecks of ships, and take pictures.  It is very little to work with, but the game is a state of Early Access, and for the most part, these activities are actually more fun than they sound.  You can explore the sea for treasure to unlock new gear (which is only aesthetic), explore wrecks with a group of people, which is really fun since the wrecks are designed in a nice way, and picture taking is picture taking, though there are challenges, which are nice and spice up the gameplay.In terms of movement, movement feels very fluid, and feels pretty realistic, it actually makes you feel like your swimming, and it's cool.In terms of sounds, the game has a very ambient sound design, there isn't music, there are only the sounds of the ocean.  It's very immersive, though it would be cool to see an addition like an MP3 player.In the graphics department, World of Diving shines.  Everything graphically is pretty beautiful, with the exception of some character animations and dolphin animations.  Besides that, the visuals lock in the feel of realism that the game creates so well in every department.  The  flashlight is also very good, the lighting visuals are superb.Overall, it is obvious that the devs have a serious passion for what they are creating, and while it is a bit lackluster at the moment, it is still very fun.  If you have ever wanted to explore the ocean without getting wet, World of Diving is the best choice for that experience."

I'm not deleting and re-typing a new review so all my upvotes and downvotes will remain from the previous review.The atmosphere, the graphics, the feeling of actually being there swimming and diving is excellent and top notch. The game itself, though, is hardly there.Your character can be somewhat customized and upgraded as you play and earn virtual currencies. The charcater models and textures are excellent. This game has one of the best first person views of any game. If I had a VR set it would only multiply how awesome it is to see my flippers and hands and chest and even my groin while swimming around. Top-Notch stuff there.There are very well detailed enviroments and every level/map/zone is different than each other keeping that part fresh and unique. Each level/map/zone, though very detailed, are relatively small. In comparison they are about the size of a Dragon Ball Xenoverse stage (which is not very big), possibly even compared to a Quake III standard map size.The ""game"" part of this game consist of mini tasks like snapping photos collecting objects like tedious fetch quests. Follow the marker and do the obvious.I think what I was more expecting from this game was a casual exploration game where maybe I could catalog stuff and aquatic life and just swim around in a large(er) space than what the game has to offer. Especially if the game has VR support that'd be what I want to do the most. The wonder, the awe, and the getting lost in underwater exploration factors are just not there.Yeah I know the game is still Early Access. But after so many years it just needs more TLC than it gets. If the game had some larger maps and just a basic free roam mode I would change my recommendation.Good day."
