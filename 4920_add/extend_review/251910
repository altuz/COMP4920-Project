It starts out with easy missions but they get more complex and difficult as you go. It's a pretty fun game though; it's a nice break from the shoot-'em-up games. It requires a lot of patience, but I find it very fun!  Love this game!  :)"

I'd like to see more casual games like this or simillar, I'm enjoying it so far. It has a lot of levels each one a different challenge, please consider giving it a go, I did and I have enjoyed playing this little gem, I also found it Quiet relaxing too. It is a nice change from other more tedious and aggressive type games."
,Recommended,251910,9280416,"Posted: 27 February, 2014",all,Strategikal,"Relaxing but frustrating puzzle game. Each level is a puzzle you have to figure out, then you have to use mouse clicking skills to actually complete the puzzle. I like the puzzle solving aspect, but I find the skill side a bit frustrating because your timing and clicking often has to be perfect, or you have to do it again, and again, and again... This can get a little tiresome if you're stuck on a particular level.Nice relaxing music though, and it looks pretty. Recommended if you like exercising your brain and don't mind honing the mouse skills to go with it."
,Not Recommended,251910,8413599,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,Kitswulf,"Not really my thing. Its ""novel"" control system of smushing your ship away by clicking feels simultaneously floaty and yet too-precise. They don't believe in using words for menus and such wherever possible, which means it's sometimes obnoxious to navigate things. Core gameplay is not very engaging (again, to me) because it's about delicate swoops and fast reaction times. I can definitely see where other people could have fun, and it has a nice trance-void-techno aesthetic, but if you have similar tastes to me (meaty puzzles and RPGs, keeping twitch-gaming to FPS and the like) the game is going to feel immaterial and bland. 4/10, but depending on how much you enjoy the presentation/style this could go up to 8/10. I'm not recommending, but how good it is feels way more subjective than most games."

If you are into breaking records and completeing all acheivements then you will be playing much longer. I would recommend buying this game if...A) You like puzzle games.B) You like outer space.C) If it is on sale for cheap.Pros- Creates a nice atmosphere of suns, planets, etc- Gameplay is smooth on either the mouse or the gamepad- Not too frustrating but more relaxing (breaking current records may get very frustrating)- Great concept for a puzzle gameCons- The music was not as atmospheric/ambient as I would have hoped for (This was corrected by turning the game music off    and playing my own soundtrack)- I felt they could have expanded on the space theme. Suns, planets and black holes were great but I felt the time bombs didn't fit into the setting at all. They should have replaced them with an exploding comet or something found in outer spaceOverall this is one of those good little games to pick up during a Steam sale.http://youtu.be/UXrGmwY_Dw4"
,Not Recommended,251910,14395139,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,Reality,"Their are dozens of puzzle games these days. Some are really fast action things like tetris or Bequeled where you have to think on your feet and have fast reflexes. Others are esoteric and ask you to solve problems like adventure games in the vein of myst, king's quest, machinarium, etc.This game struggles with picking a camp. Some levels ask you to go through outrageously fast, while others take a lot of time (or at least it feels like a lot of time by comparison). It also has a reallly terrible difficulty curve that seesaws between difficult levels and cakewalks which you have to deal with starting in the first chapter of the game, and is still an issue by the fourth and last area.Graphics and controls do their job, I kinda like straight up space: Lots of pretty pictures of Nebulas and Wolf-Rayet Stars and things are included in this game. It's always easy to tell what is background and what is a phyiscs object, which some of these games struggle with.You get levels that ask for a degree of pre-planning and then precision execution of each step, and then levels with such a bizarre 1-step solution that the only way to find it is to keep throwing trial and error restarts using different angles and timings, and then watch the game play itself when you finally get it right.This is the main problem with the game. Satisfaction. It's addictive enough where you want to beat all these par challenges, but once you've overcome them, you don't get any sense of ""♥♥♥♥ YEAH I DID IT"""
,Recommended,251910,8268429,"Posted: 24 December, 2013",all,Toobs,"Well, I had high hopes for this game, thinking it was a modern version of Solar 2. It is not. BUT, it still turned out to be a pretty damn gopod game in its own right. It is a physics puzzle type game where you go around colelcting plasma balls and shooting them into stars to save them from death. You start out on a space station where you l;aunch yourself in whichever direction you wish, and there is planets and debris scattered around that you need to navigate through. You can use the planets orbits to your advantage to move without using up your fuel, and the same goes for shooting plasma into the stars, it creates an energy burst which also can propel you. Pretty clever little game, im glad i bought it, i reccomend it for anyone who is into casual physics puzzle games. Things like Angry birds or Gravity Badgers. This game is along the lines of those, but more complex and in my opinion a LOT better."

Pick it up  if you are interested in the artwork but I cannot recommend this game to anybody but sadists.

,Not Recommended,251910,8861606,"Posted: 26 January, 2014",all,nozetsu,"Just a puzzler, you'll find many better free at kongregate.It has a few design flaws that make me wish I didn't pay for this.The biggest flaw - speed. No boost, no fastforward, heck even the UI moves slow in this game. This game needs accuracy if you aim for the top score, you will have to restart a lot when you miss with the thrust. Maybe it's a little thing, but it made me rage quit the game - each and every time you restart you have to stare for 1-2 seconds at rhe mission title screen.Also, a minor one here, none of the buttons have captions. I can guess what which button does, but I'd be glad to be sure what it does after I point at it, you know?"
,Not Recommended,251910,17188382,"Posted: 23 July, 2015",all,3Tea,"This game is really one dimensional. Once you've figured out what to do on a certain level, you're going to have to spend a couple of minutes fondling around with the controls trying to get skim through the levels.It could've been good, if it was longer, and more about puzzles. Right now, it's just a boring construct of a game that feels like it is uncompleted. There could've been more mechanics in the game, more levels that were about actual brain-work rather than frustrating maneuvering. Because of this, it doesn't stand out. There is really nothing special about this game.The soundtrack, visuals, effects, sounds... Are nothing special IMO.This game isn't worth $10, but it is worth $0<$5 whenever the occasional sale arrives."

76561198004588005,Recommended,251910,31614097,Posted: 7 May,all,Ikari,"A typical game for any nerds, if there's still any out there. You visit stars, loads of stars, some levels have four suns, some underpowered and some about to blow but your machine is build to be friendly with the suns across four galaxies in hte game. The game is hard and it is funny when you lose because the ship is tough to align. It is a very very nerdy game.  This game is better then Star Wars if it encourages players to be friendly towards any star across galaxies. This game prepares any future astronaut to be friends with the suns. A shame that all the suns are represented with the color of the level tier. I would of liked if the colored sun would mix together and be in one level, not divided!Also the game has good graphics."
