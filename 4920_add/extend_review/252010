,Recommended,252010,20125228,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,Yoj,"In the age where most indie games feature pixel art graphics of some sort just for the sake of style or nostalgia, the developers at JoyMasher bring you the real deal with Oniken. How authentic can a modern implementation of a classic 8-bit action platformer be? Probably not much more than Oniken.You play as Zaku — a ninja mercenary, who helps the resistance in fighting the titular evil military organization (Oniken), that's attempting to control what's left of the post-apocalyptic world. If that doesn't seal the deal for you in itself, then continue reading :).This whole game reeks of eighties, not only in terms of visuals and sound, but the overall game design as well, not to mention the story, which is told in short cutscenes between levels. The artists did an amazing job with the visuals: the graphics aren't stylized to look like 8-bit — they are 8-bit, and great at that. The same can be easily said about sound — both music and sound-effects are unmistakably 8-bit and fit the overall game well. The levels in this game have their own different look and feature various gameplay elements and mechanics: there are classic horizontal scrolling segments, vertical scrolling segments, auto-scrolling segments and platforming segments. The boss-fights are epic, with bosses ranging from regular-sized enemy characters to bosses in crafts, mechanisms with turrets, gigantic fire-breathing snakes, etc.Oniken doesn't boast a large arsenal of weapons — you're pretty much limited to using your massive sword (which you can power up) as the main weapon and grenades (which you'll need to pick up) as a sub-weapon, but that's not really a problem, since slicing your way through enemies is the meat of the game. Despite this, you'll have your chance to shoot some enemies via some shooting segments, which also exist in Oniken.it's true that sometimes Oniken may seem a little bit too authentic for it's own good, with the game being rather challenging, both gameplay- and game-design wise. Think ""Ninja Gaiden"" on the NES. Some levels throw a crap ton of enemies at you, while other times an additional checkpoint would make all the difference. Still, that doesn't mean Oniken is a bad game, not in the slightest — it just means that you need to persevere. Git Gud or Die Tryin. Are you a man enough to play this game? Then buy it, sadly almost nobody did.P.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow theCRIMINALLY Low Salessteam curator."

While the visual presentation is certainly nostalgic, the game just doesn't play well. The movements of both your PC and the enemies are twitchy. This, combined with the extremely limited movement set in relation to the level design, just makes the game artificially hard.I love a good challenge, but Oniken doesn't give the player the tools needed to face its challenges, which makes it an exercise in frustration and repetition more than anything. Good for a bit of nostalgia, but it has nothing on the NES games it tries to emulate or other throwback games like Shovel Knight.I will give it more time to see if it picks up, but for now I'm not impressed."

Now don’t get me wrong, there’s some good stuff to talk about here. When the game’s action works, it works very well: I definitely had several nice moments where I was really in the zone, wasting enemies, lobbing grenades, and managing to survive on just a sliver of health. If you’ve ever found yourself pining for the days of deadly, challenging, two-button NES action, Oniken is specifically designed to scratch that itch. The 8-bit graphics are really well-done, the music is pretty good, and there are plenty of cool (if strangely wordy) Ninja Gaiden-like cut scenes.Unfortuntaely, these strengths can’t make up for the game’s weaknesses. Oniken is an extremely difficult game, but its difficulty doesn’t always feel compelling or well-earned. There are tons of cheap deaths and lame obstacles that seem more interested in punishing you than giving you an interesting and fun challenge. The platforming sections are terrible; whenever you have to jump around and hang from something, the game becomes especially annoying. The levels are also way too long, which can’t be said of most of the NES games that Oniken wants to emulate; those old games are tough but they usually dole out the action in bite-sized pieces. Oniken, on the other hand, just feels like a slog. When I beat a mission in Oniken, I thought “ugh, I’m glad that’s finally over” and not “that was a fun and worthwhile way to spend my time.”I love tough NES action games like Shatterhand, Ninja Gaiden, Shadow of the Ninja, etc., so I was very prepared to enjoy this. However, I think that Oniken only takes certain things from those games (difficulty, art style) but leaves out the stuff that actually made them great (fun, creating a compelling experience for the player). If you're a real old school NES head, I can definitely see how this game would interest you, but it's just not very good. If you're extremely curious and you really want to play it, the game goes on sale a lot and shows up in bundles, so wait until you can get it on the cheap."

The controls are snappy and perfectly responsive, the gameplay is straightforward and both fair and punishing, and the art style is the same one that made the ninja boom of the late 80s worthwhile.

I wasn't really sold on Oniken when I picked it up during a holiday Steam sale, being put off by the somewhat stiff controls and punishing difficulty, I didn't see it through past stage 3. However, coming off the high of Odallus prompted me to give Joymasher's debut another shot.Oniken is tough. Sunsoft tough. Players who cut their teeth on games like the NES Batman and Journey to Silius will know what I'm getting at. Fast reflexes do play a part in your success, but memorizing the kinds of things a stage will throw at you and being able to consistently execute are paramount. It will throw you into that good kind of old school difficulty rage fit, that which motivates you to keep trying and not let that cheating♥♥♥♥♥game get the better of you. Unfortunately it also suffers from ""try to get to the boss with enough health and wail on it in hopes that it dies before you do"" syndrome, but a lot of the B-list games from the 8-bit era fell into this trap.All that said, Oniken is a linear affair, and aside from the somewhat less than well hidden 1UP icons that resemble game mascots who never existed to collect in each stage, it won't exactly put your nipples in a vice grip to give it more than one shot after the end credits roll. Unless you're some kind of masochist and want to try hardcore mode. However, Oniken nails the goal of being a labor of love to late-80s manga-inspired cyberpunk platformers, with great-looking visuals in the cutscenes and some catchy tunes that make use of a limited sound channel set. Pick it up if you find it on sale, just be in for a teeth-grinding time."

,Recommended,252010,23658005,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,popoki,"tl;dr:An NES-inspired action-platformer that nails the visual aesthetic but has flaws.Oniken is a game in which you play as a ridiculously powerful mercenary named [s]Kenshiro[/s] Zaku and beat up bad guys.  It's essentially a ""neo-NES"" game that goes far to capture the look and feel of games from that era, using lots of black filler space skillfully like later NES games tended to do to maximize color usag eand depth, and even including Ninja Gaiden-esque cutscenes with some well-done pixel art for the characters.  Graphically, the game has succeeded nobly in what it set out to do, though sadly the audio doesn't quite match up; the sound effects are fine, but the music is quite drab (some of it's alright, but most is really almost surprisingly bad) and sounds a bit more like something like GXSCC that tries to emulate this kind of sound rather than something from the system itself (should've used Famitracker probably).As far as gameplay goes, it's pretty damn solid.  The ""weight"" of your character takes some getting used to, as he feels fairly heavy, but not in a way that's very uncomfortable after a few minutes of play.  In essence it fits in fairly well with any given action-platformer of the NES's later lifespan, like your Power Blade or Shatterhand type games, although a bit simpler -- the ONLY powerups you'll find (besides the rare health pack or 1-up) are grenades, your one and only (but quite effective) sub-weapon, and a sword icon that doubles the length of your blade until you take damage - or you can press the 'berserk' button to sacrifice it early in favor of a brief attack buff.  Despite the game's look and feel definitely trying to evoke classic Nintendo, the swordplay decidedly feels like Sega'sStrider.It's not a terribly long or difficult game, surprising considering the era and style it's trying to emulate; the game automatically adds each stage to a 'natural stage select' on the main menu as you pass them, there are plenty of powerups and you have a huge life bar that's slow to deplete with relatively few platforming challenges.  The real difficulty comes from the bonus content that comes after you finish the game, including a lengthy, challenging, but unique new stage and two extremely taxing new modes that definitely make the game ""Nintendo-hard"", so keep that in mind if the game feels a bit flimsy to you, oh classic game master.It's not perfect.. aside from the music, the story's pretty pathetic (though so fitting for the time period it's forgivable) and there's just no depth or innovation here at all.  But if you're looking for a totally decent NES love-letter that does the job better than a good chunk of the modern retro-indie drivel you see out there, give Oniken a go."

Everything about Oniken feels like a game from the 80's or early 90's (Ninja Gaiden or Strider are the best examples) except you don't have to start from the very beginning of the game when you run out of lives (Something that I'm actually really glad isn't like how it was back in the day) which is good considering you'll do a lot of dying your first time through a level, just like any good action game.

They did a good job of simulating the NES difficulty from back in the day, but without the sluggish controls that plagued many games from that era.

,Not Recommended,252010,14413917,"Posted: 9 February, 2015",all,Helios Leinheart,"Nobody appreciates more than me a developer that tries to revive the old ways of video games. However, games today have to have mechanics that can hold your attention. NES sidescrollers are a dime a dozen, so it's no wonder that only a handful of them became popular with gamers. Oniken compares more to those random obscure sidescrollers when it should be more comparable to the memorable ones like Ninja Gaiden.In honor of this game's admirable attempt to revive the NES era, I will review it as any magazine from the old days would.---Controls - 3/5 - Movement in Oniken is extremely fast which often leaves you little time to react to an enemy. Pressing up and attack uses a grenade, but pressing up while in the air halts your forward movement which can lead to accidental deaths when you push up.Graphics - 4/5 - The cutscenes are decent, but the sprite animations are boring. The main character's run cycle is only about 3 or 4 frames. Backgrounds really capture the spirit of NES era graphics and are well made.Sound - 2/5 - Music is acceptable, but has no melody to it and is easily forgettable. The sound effect you'll be hearing the most is the sword swing. Strangely, most of the other sound effects are barely audible.Replayability - 2/5 - The game is extremely linear and doesn't offer any deviation from the main path. The only benefit of replaying the game is having an easier time due to prior knowledge of enemy placement and mechanics. Some secrets can be found in destructible walls.---I enjoyed the novelty of playing something that felt like an NES game on Steam, but that's about the extent of my enjoyment. Getting it cheap in a bundle is the only way I could recommend it. Paying full price is highly discouraged."
,Recommended,252010,21273794,"Posted: 17 February, 2016",all,lob☆lob,"Probably the best Brazillian game you will ever play.As a reto-styled indie game, Oniken is hardly unique in premise. However; most retro-styled indie games are only ""retro"" in terms of visuals/sound and do not capture the enticing gameplay aspects of retro gaming. Retro games were about introducing new challenges to the player and making the most out of the limited hardware available at the time. Since graphical fidelity has progressed well past 8-bit sprites no indie game can capture the latter aspect, but Oniken certainly feels authentically retro because of its focus on platforming-action mechanics, challenging level design and simple but addictive weapons. This puts it well ahead of the curve as most other ""retro"" indie games have no depth to their game design and feel like performing a series of menial tasks.Oniken borrows a lot of design cues from some of the best action platformers available on the NES such as ninja gaiden, pitting the player against a variety of different bosses, enemies and level hazards which encourage the player to memorise the levels and come up with their own solutions. It further mixes things up with auto-scrolling levels which take the form of either platforming challenges or run-n'-gun style vehicle levels where the player will have to time their shots and jumps right to proceed.The quality of the movement system and the simple, responsive controls prevent all of this challenge from feeling tedious/frustrating, along with this the sword and grenade weapons although lacking in variety, feel versatile enough to reliably deal with everything the game throws at you if you are willing to think about how to get past new obstacles.The most important part of all of this is that it does feel rewarding to progress, as the cutscenes are a great throwback to the 80's, with badass gruff characters, cheesy-but-likeable villains, insane campy stunts and true-to-NES seizure effects. Although Oniken could not get away with all the gore and swearing that it has if it was to be published on the NES in the 80's, it still feels like a love letter to the action heroes of the era. What feels even more rewarding is completing each level without dying, and then progressing through the levels quickly enough to get the steam achievements. It gives Oniken a lot of replay value and is a case of game achievements actually being done right (as in, it actually feels like you've achieved something in a sense).Overall, Oniken stands up there with games like Shovel Knight, Satazius, and Cave Story as ""retro-styled"" indie games that are actually retro in terms of design and comes with all of the glorious challenge and fun that comes with this style of game design actually being executed correctly. One of the best things about retro action games was that you could actually become as badass as the protagonist by playing well, and Oniken captures this aspect perfectly."
,Recommended,252010,29051072,Posted: 5 January,all,Baphomet,"Evil cyborgs, ronin, and wacky 80s NES style all come together to form Oniken, the first offering from Joymasher. The plot is pretty straightforward: you, a big strong guy, must go slice up all the bad robot guys and save the world somehow.Playing this game reminds me a lot of the Contra series on NES/SNES. You definitely need to memorize every part of each stage along with every enemy and boss attack pattern as just relying on your reflexes will lead to an early death. The game is equally unforgiving, putting you back on the very first level in a chapter after losing your last life (though you do get infinite continues, thankfully). This can seem tedious at first but it also serves to give you time to reflect on why exactly you lost and how to improve your chances on the next attempt.Oniken combines just the right amount of difficulty and gameplay to give an experience that is akin to retro titles while stopping just short of breaking your will to continue. Consider grabbing it if you’re a fan of older Contra-style games."

I got hit because of missed inputs.- No auto-fire for attacking. Getting blisters is something I do not miss from the NES days.- If you get hit, you fall backwards ala early NES games. The problem is that modern games has shown us that this is bad design. Its very frustrating to get sniped and fall to your death- Weird timing on enemy shots. I played a lot of NES and retro games. Enemies have this 1-2-3 timing. Oniken's enemies has an awkward 1-2-2.5 timing that throws me off.- Missing startup animations. Its so weird to see your enemies suddenly firing without cheorgraphing their attacks. I understand that they are going for an NES game design, but even old games like Contra will freeze their enemies in ""ready animation"" for a few milliseconds before firing. Because there is no startup animation, I often find myself off-guard when the enemy attacks.That said, even with all the negatives of this game, I will still recommend it to Retro gamers. Since it only takes 2 hours to finish, the game (almost) didn't feel too long to make the faults matter."

Not as difficult as the old nail biters for us who love them... but also not easy enough to get bored.I love speedrunning games.  My main game was always Demon's Crest and Gargoyle's Quest 2, both of which I've spent thousands of hours on perfecting in order to get the times I've gotten.  I feel the same pace of action in these games even if its more sword less shooty.  The controls are tight and feel right.  Attacking has some really cool little gimmicks behind it.  Most of you from Symphony of the Night / other Metroidvanias will fondly recall the Jump slash land slash combo.  But more than that, you can cancel your slashes by crouching, so that you can Slash crouch slash slash crouch slash over and over for a really cool trick.  Things like this make games replayable, little skillsets that you can improve at and get better with.That said, this game is not flawless.  This game has major issues with difficulty.  Now, most of you might wonder why.  Enemy placement / attacks are good and difficult to get around.  The problem comes from this -1) Your health - You have too much health.  By simply brute forcing your way through levels and bosses you generally have enough HP to get to the next section.  Enemy attacks are not very damaging in general.  If you just keep moving forward and jumping, you'll likely make it to the next section with 2 bits of HP left only to be fully healed on the next section.  Combine this with the fact that you're likely to find 1 or even 2 health ups per section and you're blazing by pretty healthy.2) Grenades - Strong enough to kill many problematic enemies in one HP as well as abundant enough to never worry about them.  Some minibosses can be killed by simply spamming your grenades a few times.  I like that they are not easy to land and thus grant a bit of a bonus for your effort, though I would have been more appreciative of a slightly less damaging item.I realize as someone who's played the unholy hell out of Demon's Crest / Gargoyle's Quest II I am probably biased toward more difficult games.  And don't get me wrong, this game isn't 'Easy'.  If the developers wanted a 'Medium' for difficulty, they're certainly not far from it.I'll be honest - I expected another 'Retro' game that misses the point of going back to the old days.  You guys did not miss that point.  You captured what was fun in these games by meticulously getting the controls and fighting right.  And for that you do deserve praise.  Keep up the good work and Odallus will be just as good, if not better."

The levels are short, and you have checkpoints and extra lives at your disposal.The game expects that you will die and next time through remember enemy placements and effective attack patterns.  You were never meant to breeze through this game in one try.Controls are simple, enemy attacks can be dodged if you learn placements and timing and you're given a fairly large health pool and plentiful resource drops (considering what type of game this is).Much as I hate that everything gets compared to dark souls, It's the same concept here: be patient, look out for patterns, expect to die a few times until you learn and git gud."

You move left/right.  Jump with one button & attack with the other.  You can crouch under projectiles and attack while crouching or jumping. UP+Attack is to throw a grenade & there's a special pick up that gives you a slightly larger attack radius & if you have at least 2 stacks of it you can use your Berserk power which gives you invincibility & upgrades your attack to god like levels for a few seconds.  Every time you take damage you lose one stack of berserk, so you gotta not get hit to keep it up.The game is pretty hard & gets harder as you progress.  It even has that annoying knock back effect when you get hit & yes, I've been knocked back into pitfalls quite a bit.  Classic NES difficulty right there.  It's not as hard as Ninja Gaiden, though. The levels do get easier as you learn your way around them & get used to how the game plays.  Nothing ever really feels like it's unfair.  It's just challenging.It plays like any classic NES action platform game similar to Ninja Gaiden or Strider.  Each level has a two or 3 parts to it with bosses at the end of each segment & checkpoints in case you lose a life.  If you lose all your lives it's back to the very beginning of the stage & you get 3 lives per level with a hidden life somewhere in each stage for a total of 4 lives.  Once you beat a stage your lives reset to 3 for the next stage regardless of how many lives you have.The downside to all this is you will die a lot the first time you play through it.  The game seems to be based on a trial & error type design.  Once you know your way around a level & how to beat the areas/bosses it gets a lot easier.  Everything is set up so you can easily beat it once you know what you're doing.  A good example is when I first played through Level 2 I died quite a few times & had to start over more than once, but now I can play through it without dying that much.FEATURESThe level select feature is kind of like Volgarr the Viking (if you've played that game you'll find this game easy by comparison).  Once you beat a stage you can skip it & go to the next stage the next time you play via the level select menu.There is also a High Score feature.  Once you beat a level, you get a score.  These don't really matter unless you want them to.  You can always go back & replay levels to try and beat your high score & upload your best toal score to the Leaderboards.  High Scores are based on how much health, lives & upgrades you have at the end of the level as well as how quickly you get through them.The game also has some cool cutscenes similar in style to Ninja Gaiden.OVERALLOverall, I'm not too far into the game but I've seen enough to recommend it.  It's got all the stuff Retro fans will love so if you like old school games then you should pick this one up especially if it's on a good sale."

It has its difficulty, but, it isn't Ninja Gaiden level of difficulty. The controls let you know you are always in control of Zaku, and reminds you it is always your fault when you die, so yeah, a NES game. The enemies are pretty normal for a platformer, being the shooters the most ball busting enemy if it is put in a boulder next to a fall, besides of that, it keeps really fresh all the game. Bosses are kinda forgettable, they are kinda easy but if you take your time, if you go all in against them, they will crush you.So yeah, NES game baby!"
,Recommended,252010,17867491,"Posted: 3 September, 2015",all,YagamiBrando,"Oniken is definitely one of the best retro indies I've completed lately. And I definitely recommend it to anybody who was raised on NES games. Let me tell you why.STORYThe plot is pretty simple, but still good. We assume the role of a cool swordsman called Zaku, a strong and silent type. He reminded me of Guts from Berserk series a bit, well he still has something unique in him anyway. Zaku joins the small resistance group who fight against the powerful military organization ""Oniken"", who took control over the world during war crisis. So our hero fights against this organization and almost single-handedly defeats it. There will be some simple plot twists, but overall the story is quite straightforward. But anyway the characters are all good, I especially liked the bad guys. Oh yeah, and the cinematic cutscenes are just awesome, just like in the old ninja gaiden games, and even better.SOUNDTRACKSome people say it's amazing, but... I dunno, it could be better. The only themes I really enjoyed were the intro cutscene theme and the main menu theme. Still not bad though.GAMEPLAYGameplay is pretty simplistic, our hero can move, jump, duck and slash with his sword. There is only one sub weapon in the game - grenades. Look not that useful in the beginning, but believe me, there will be moments when yyou bless you saved some in your arsenal. Also, there is a sword upgrade in the game, when you aquire one your sword shoots a small projectile slash forward, when you swing it. During the time when you have your sword upgrade tap ""Berserk"" button to go berserk, become invincible for a short time and inflict some heavy damage. Very helpful during boss fights. And yeah, boss fights are just epic, at least some of them.There will be levels where you will be riding some sort of a bike. Pretty neat and a good change of pace. And there is one bonus level where you will be playing as another character with a different gameplay.VERDICTOverall I was completely satisfied with everything, well, maybe more sub weapons would be great, like grenades + 4 more sub weapons. Maybe some shotguns or pistols, or even those blade boomerangs ninja foes use. Would be funny if you could catch those and throw them back :P Anyway, Oniken is a great tribute to old NES era side scrollers, it is challenging, it has cool boss fights, it is not that long, only 6+1 levels and it has some extra modes, like boss rush and ""Hardcore mode"" if you were not satisfied with the difficulty. Definitely get it and beat it! You will not be dissapointed. 9/10"

That reason is frustration.Seriously, go back and play the very first megaman game, then play any of its sequels. Go play Castlevania on the NES. Or Contra. Or the original Shinobi, or any old arcade game. You will learn very quickly how frustrating those games can be, and how unfair some of their design is. Granted some of this is down to the limitations of the hardware at the time, but what is often mistaken for ""brutal hardcore difficulty"" is actually just glitches, lessions which have not yet been learned due to when these games came out, or poor design decisions.Oniken sadly, in its fervent zeal to deliver a faithful oldschool experience, does exactly that. TO THE LETTER. It even has some of the classic mistakes that older games made. Unlike the actual retro games of the 80s and such, though, it has little excuse for this. They made those mistakes because it was new, it wasn't something that had been encountered fully before, with full colour graphics, higher resolution, scrolling backgrounds, complex controls, more than 16k of memory and the like... Oniken has had years of examples of mistakes not to make and deliberately seems to set out ot make them. This results in a 100% faithfully retro game, for good or ill...Now, honestly, I like my games to be challenging, but not dickish. Oniken fails in that regard. I find it difficult to want to sink more hours into a game which requires you to be practically precognizant to avoid dying horribly at every single turn. I do applaud its faithfulness, but honestly it's not  a game I feel has been worth my money or time. That saddens me quite a bit because there's clearly a lot of love put into this game. The attention to detail is great. It even FEELS like I'm playing an old NES game. Hell I would honestly have trouble not believing you if you told me this WAS a NES game just running in an emulator like FCEUx with a custom frontend on it.I'm gonna vote this as a non recommendation, but i will add a caveat saying that if you want an authentically retro-styled game that 100% matches the games of ages past, then this absolutely is worth looking at in every respect. The spritework is fantastic, the music is pretty cool, the gameplay is pretty solid, but oh my god be prepared to hit walls of frustration a mile high."

,Recommended,252010,33992154,Posted: 3 August,all,Graham von Poopenswine,"Rating: 8/10Oniken is a fun little platformer that pays hommage to NES titles such as Ninja Gaiden and Rygar; however, takes all the elements that makes those titles good and makes it it's own, even the difficulty. It has a lot of polish in all the right areas; however, it does have it's quirks. Here are all the noticable pros and cons I picked up while playing this wonderful, yet difficult game:+ Has a fully animated opening cinematic shown before even seeing the main menu.+ Super tight jump controls that feels just right.+ Diverse repertoire of enemies offer a sense accomplishment when defeated.+ Hidden breakable walls offer reward for exploration.+ Level design polish in the form of animations on breakable things that normally wouldn’t be breakable, such as falling rocks. Some developers would simply program them fall vertically and damage the player accordingly; however, JoyMasher goes above and beyond, and as a testament to the quality of their game via polish, you can slash their rocks.- Oniken launches in a windowed launcher that lets the player have access to features should have been handled in the main menu instead.- Limited supply of powerups diminish the player experience, there are literally two: Sword Powerup and Grenades.- Where Oniken did succeed in learning from it's predecessor's mistakes, it falls short with it's convoluted grenade throwing mechanic.- Unbalanced gameplay difficulty makes for more of a three-yard hurdle by the second stage, forcing the player through three long unique sections of the game that feel like they should all three be their own stages."

On the other hand the protagonist has practically no momentum or weight, this makes the platforming segments really awkward and you don't feel like its entirely your fault when you die (some could argue its just trying to bring the NES ""hard as balls"" feel but even in castlevania when you die it's your fault- not theirs). Also the enemy design needs some work, enemies fire projectiles in a way that you have no way to manuver through them fairly and they can even hit you as soon as you enter the screen! But when it comes down to it it's still just plain fun, nice button response and movement excluding the above mentioned issues, would only recommend due to the pricing.Once again: Fun, but VERY flawed"

Even with those small things that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥us off back on the NES times: throwback when hit, specially near cliffs, back to beginning of the level after losing all lives, instant death things on the environment, cheap bosses and such.But after all those frustrating features, the game have much better controls than the old games. It's very fluid and precise. I played with a X One controller and the character 'weight' seemed very nice. The key to beat this game is to have patience and learn every single step you'll need to take, the accurate precision of the control is more than necessary to master the levels. When you do, it's so rewarding. Its just like in the past, when you beat a tough level and feel like mastering the game indeed.The graphics and sounds are not memorable comparing to other indie retro games around. They're nice though. Oniken for me seems like one of that obscure little gems that almost no one knew and few talked about, until a friend got it and all kids on the neighbourhood went to that friend's house to see the game.Overall I'd recommend this one to big retro platformer fans, who likes difficult games and could spend 1 hour trying to beat one single level. If you don't like those kind of games and are willing to play more casual or not so difficult games, you probably be frustrated with oniken. You probably should look for similar titles like Shovel Knight and such.But I'd kindly insist that casual players should take a look at it and have a little extra patience to play Oniken.

The enemies are nice and vary per stage (a few keep popping back up but whats wrong with a few reacurring enemies?) the bosses are nice and there are even a few surprise fights that i wasn't expecting. The level design is smart and intuitive (enemies range and abilities are actually taken into consideration in level design or enemy placement) and the backgrounds are well done and are nice to look at and is accompanied by a soundtrack that fits this game to a 'T'. Controls are simple, easy to learn, but when you die its generally your fault because the controls are very responsive, oh and by the way first run you probably will die. thats a good thing, difficulty is your typical NES brand of hard, but its not overbearing and frustrating, the game seems to know the boundry between difficult and broken very well for i never find myself in a position where i know theres  not chance to win unless i put myself there. in closing i look foward to finishing the game, and probably will continue after i finish this review, Final thought: if your looking at this and wondering if its worth it... it is."

There are six levels with three sub-stages per level, and honestly, I completed the first three levels without any real trouble. It's the later three levels where the challenge really shows. The secret to beating them is, (like most of the platformers of the day) lots of repetition and memorization of patterns. Even the hardest stage, (which in my opinion was stage five) will become easier after enough play, so don't get frustrated and discouraged. Just play, die, and repeat and you will see that the stages gradually become easier and easier until you can beat them.

Music is decent, visuals very close to the era that inspired it, levels varied with neat set-pieces that break the basic hack n slash-platform formula.The only major complaint I have with the title that prevents me from openly recommending it to fans of the genre is the kind of dodgy hit detection in regards with your character. Many times I felt that I should have dodge a spike trap or a large enemy but it seems like most of the threats in each level have in a way some kind of force field around them. If you don't clear the dangers clean, you will get hit. Still, the controls are solid enough that you can easily get used to this and avoid them."

And it succeeds in it.This game reminded me of my NES days, playingContraand stuff. There's not a lot more to it.There are 6 missions, some 20ish enemies, some bosses... Hell, if you ever played a platformer, you know what this game is about. If not, watch a video -- you're getting exactly what you're seeing.Hit detection is pretty good, so you won't get frustrated for no reason. It pulls some cheap shots on player occasionally, yeah -- like, when you appear on a new location, you might instantly get shot at, with no time to react (especially if you're first time in that location), so you'll lose some HP. But you're getting over it really fast.For those of you who haven't played NES, I'll explain the difference between the modern games and the old-school (NES included) games -- they arereallyhard. And I'm not even talking ""oh, damn, I'll need to reload my savegame to complete this part!"", I'm talking about legit ""holy ♥♥♥♥ing crap, I have to start the whole damn level over, because of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss that showed up 20 min into the mission"". You'll be biting your nails, you'll be getting really angry at the game, you'll feel frustrated a lot -- basically, like playingDark Souls, but with no stats progression and any XP or similar features.Should I buy this game?It depends. Game's really good, in it's own genre. It takes patience and a lot of time to master. Some reviews say, that the game tries too hard to look like an 80s platformer (that it's way too hard, too old-school, etc.), which is not true -- the game isexactlyhow games in the 80s have been. So, if you're okay with it, it's a no-brainer, really -- that's a must-buy for you."

Especially the later sections in the game are quite tough but still manageable if you memorize the boss patterns and make use of some simple methods.Even though many players may not be impressed by the pseudo 8-Bit graphics, I still must stress out the smooth pixel artwork. The devs sure have a good taste of gory Anime shows and rock hard sidescrollers from the golden past. Music, sound effects and even controls all feel like a legit NES game and do their job perfectly. Sweet.The only letdown is that it's not really a long game at the end of the day. Sure, the later stages indeed consume a lot of time until you beat them, but theoretically it's possible to see the ending after half an hour if you're really good.Ultimately I can say that Oniken represents a solid Strider/Ninja Gaiden clone with some really nice moments and awesome boss fights.

However the game has a specifically irratating level design that makes the difficulty rather cheap.The problem with these nostalgia throw back games is that whilst they are great to look at, they also include all the features that annoyed us during the original generation. Having lives is okay, but having to restart the same cheap difficult level over and over is another thing.Also the controls are a little delayed which can make certian sections of the game even more frustrating. When you have to frequently jump you have time you button presses early because the response time is not spot on.It is a shame really because this game has a lot of things to like about it.

There are many indie games that have a retro aesthetic, but Oniken is one of the few that actually feels 8-Bit, from the color pallette to the music and pixellated cutscenes.Beware if you're easily frustrated, Oniken is certainly not an easy game. While it's not as punishing and unfair as many NES era games, (I'm looking at you Ninja Gaiden) there is still plenty of old-school difficulty. You'll definitely have to play stages a few times and memorize enemy placement and attack patterns.While the mechanics are fairly simplistic, they are solid and responsive; and the game never overstays its welcome.

It has great gameplay, level design, soundtrack and sound effects. Sadly though I’m not sure if I will be able to complete this game because the game gets very tough after level 3 and I don’t feel I will have the skill or patience to complete it. Still though it’s a great game especially if you like arcade style games and if you like a challenge."

Great controls, a game that is long enough to be fulfilling but doesn't wear thin, interesting levels, and a level of difficulty that is challenging but not unfair, it's an easy recommendation."

There were a few too many autoscrolling levels for my taste and level 5 handed my♥♥♥♥♥to me for as long as it took me to get through the rest of the game, but for the most part, I enjoyed this game. It feels like an old school NES game and brought back memories of playing Ninja Gaiden and Strider. There are also bonus modes after the main game like boss rush, but those may be a little too difficult for most people."

A sidescrolling hack and slash game that tests your skills and reflexes. When I started up the game I was expecting something like Ninja Gaiden, but instead I get a game that has fun power ups and tricky but fair traps involved. The cutscenes in the game look like they came out of some obscure japanese anime, but seem to fit the setting the game is based in. I do enjoy games that put in extra effort to be different from what we have today with how far 3D graphics and environments have come in recent years. Hopefully you can have as much fun as I did with it."

Then there's also a boss rush mode and insane people can try the hardcore mode where you play through everything with just one life.If you are into 2d games then buy this only if you don't mind a hard game, if you are into hard games then this is just the thing for you. If the game isn't hard enough for you then you can always try beating your own high scores and try to get all the achievements.By the way, read the GAME MANUAL. Yes steam apparently always had game manuals. And I actually didn't know you could throw grenades or go berserk mode in the early stages."

Oniken transits between these worlds, with emphasis on gaiden, and works very well.The graphics are dated from the atari classics, as well as the cut scenes (which, by the way, are pretty cool).The plot is a half-action movie from the 80's, a guy with a sword against an entire kkk exercise (but it's fun to watch the dialogues).As for the gameplay is super simple to understand and flows very well during game, we have several boss and miniboss to face. I think the only negative point is to be short, there are 6 missions plus 1 extra, boss rush and hard core (for real good luck: D) I made 100% with 10 hours.Pros.

If you are fan of 8-bit era games - Oniken is the best choice!"
,Recommended,252010,32195388,Posted: 5 June,all,🅙🅐🅨🅒🅔🅡🅐🅝,"Oniken is basically a cross between several 8 bit era games.  It has the feel of a Contra game with it's strange robot alien monsters, the physics of Ninja Gaiden with wall jumping and sword slashing, along with a touch of battle toads with its variable stages.  It is difficult, it will punish you, but in true classic style its about replaying the game to develop skill.  The cutscenes are like something out of anime.  The artwork is absolutely beautiful and the music fits the game itself.If you want to feel like an 80s kid sitting down after school playing your NES, this is it right here.  Oniken has a number of secrets as well.  It honestly is a fun game but challenging and at times will make you feel like throwing your controller."

And I'm super weak against the Ninja Gaiden style cutscenes, though they can be kinda long.My only real problem with this game is that the normal enemies take too much damage considering where they're placed, and what they're capable of. Maneuvering around them is basically the only challenge they present, and once you've dodged their attacks and gotten close enough to attack, you've basically 'solved' them... but then they don't die, which puts you in danger of getting hit anyway, and you basically have to solve each enemy a second time to get past them. If most of them died in one hit, I think it would make for a faster and more satisfying game. It's still fun, but you just need to be a little more careful than you would expect.Update: Sweeeet lord this game needs more checkpoints. It'll send you back to the beginning of long sections you've already cleared, sometimes."

Oniken is a short, side-scrolling action platformer in the vein of Contra that nails the aesthetic, music, atmosphere, gameplay...and most importantly, the cutscenes.  There's more cheese here than a Chicago style pizza...and it's just as tasty.At $5 I can  recommend it, but I'd advise on waiting for Oniken to be on sale.  While it's fun and enjoyable, it only lasts around 3 hours and by the end you remember what these games really are about...nostalgia and cheap enemies.A fun nod to the past, but not much more than that.7/10"

But I can't not recommend the game. The fact is thatthis is for a very niche audience; This is for people who wants a nostalgia fueled game that does not compromise its retroness. The single concession it seems to make is to let you choose the mission you want to start playing, if you beat the previous mission at least once. So thankfully, it seems to acknowledge that the lives/continue system so common back then was a pointless inheritance of the arcade. But this modern concept is definitely the exception in Oniken.What I'm trying to say is that every poor design choice in the game seems intentional. The designers seem very aware of what they did. Even if I do not enjoy the game, their goal was to make a unapologetically nostalgic game and they did exactly that!  And it does a good job at it; If someone showed me footage of this game telling me it's an nes game I would believe it.So if that is EXACTLY what you want get it now. Emphasis on ""exactly"" because if you just like retro graphics or chiptunes or just enjoy platformers, then skip it.I got this with Odallus, by the same devs. If you want a simple platformer with pixel graphics but none of this ninja gaiden memorization-driven difficulty, Odallus is a... slightly safer bet."
