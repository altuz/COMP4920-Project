There are a few things that I missed on my first playthrough. 1 There is a settings menu, which is great! unfortuatly messing around with the resolution a bit broke the game, my second screen, and my steam, Some how it inverted the colors and filled the screen with dots. Even then the menu screens still were in the wrong resolution and had big black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, In game it fit the screen fine. The second problem I ran into was to do with the physics, I had alot of very bad clipping problems with a few of them resulting in my loader or what ever I was picking up flying into the wall. The third problem was that nothing had any weight or feel to it, it felt as if I was driving a hover loader picking up things with a anti gravity device or something, because they all just slid around on the floor. The fourth thing was the default music was way too loud. While looking in the settings tab I found you could import your own music *HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ More games need to do that! I can see they were aiming for a realistic feel to the game but it was a bit off. When you are in the first person view you can't see very much so I use the free cam, the only problem with the free cam is most of the sounds are missing when you go into free cam *Engine sounds, Debris hitting the floor ect* The physics just freeze sometimes, the game is still running *rain falling and such* but the loader doesnt move at all. The game runs pretty choppy with fps drops about every 50 seconds. I will list my full pc specs aswell *16GB of RipJaw Z series ddr3 ram, Msi 970A G46, Amd fx 8350 Black Edition running at 4.0Ghz, Radeon 7870 Ghz Editio (Yes I know its bottlenecking right now I am saving up for another one but money is tight right now) and a 750W power suply* There we go I hope this review is less Bias :)"

The only settings available to change from the UI are sound, graphical quality, vsync and soft-shadows.  It hard locks the resolution @ 640x480 which on a 1080p monitor looks horrible.  In addition the vehicles are way to touchy and no where near realistic.A bit on the vehicles, they move too fast.  When trying to do something that requires percision, that is not an ability.  Most controls are centered to the left side of the keyboard.  WSAD for movement, RF,TG for bucket controls,  It just feels un-natural.  You should be able to select your speed when operating the machine.  In addition to the machines running way to fast, they bounce all over the place.  Or when you pick up an item in your bucket it bounces right out of said bucket.  It makes it hard to finish any of the missions.I'd rate it a 2 out of 10.  And that is only for the concept of the game.  If it was better implemented it would be a better game overall.  I would recommend passing on this game."

For a game thats is called construction machines there is really very little constructing going on. Ive come half way through the game and all i have been doing so far is loading and unloading and pouring some concrete that took  less than 60 sec to complete. The missions are really short, however this is a good thing, the machines in the game are so bad it would be torture to have longer missions. The title is great, everything else isnt. The gameplay feels akward and like an early beta, controls are akward and not acurate at all, even driving around feels strange.Shame, with a little more work, this game could maybe even work."

The controls are poor at best, they have not even used common controls. The camera angles that you operate from are far from anything decent so the number of times I have had to remote camera just to see how close to an object is rediculous. Having a camera anglethat can be chase view with the ability to pan and tilt etc would have made it better. The game is really buggy and it feels unfinished or unpolished so to speak, but I would have to say vehicle control, camera views and gameplay really needs some work."

If only i could make Helicopter Simulator 2014: Search And Rescue to work as well, that would be a charm.http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4llsgi_construction-machines-2014-how-to-run-it-in-windows-7-64-bit_videogameshttps://youtu.be/cBMxFi4qLpwIt's quite fun; i would probably play more of this. Despite its fun factor, one has a better appreciation of the people who are in this profession. They make it look too easy.Frame rate is ok; just need to adjust settings in the launcher to suit your system capability. I can get more than 60 fps if various options are set to very low on my potato PC notebook. Keyboard is used for avatar and vehicle movement while mouse is for camera. Camera views are rotatable and zoomable for external view but the cockpit view is tied to steering motion so it's a bit inconvenient to use.1st job:http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4lm6ox_construction-machines-2014-job-1-move-debris_videogamesUpdate - 2nd jobWhile the first job is easy depending on how you want to play it 'coz you can just push everything into the pit, no need to carry them in the bucket. The 2nd job is needlessly difficult. For one thing, you're supposed to load bricks onto the truck. That is fine and good BUT the bricks are scattered all over the place, not in piles as you may expect but in single pieces.Simulation detail levelTo exacerbate the task, the boom arm motion is jerky and the vehicle motion is also jerky in that it has ridiculously quick acceleration. Initially, the quick acceleration was fun in the first job but not in the this one as it makes moving the bricks frustrating 'coz it tends to bounce and fall off. Incidentally it's very difficult to scoop and carry more than one brick at a time as said before the bricks tend to fall off. Even though some bouncy motion is probably normal for Wheel Loaders, it seems excessive in this simulator; there isn't enough damping IMO but this may be due to my choice of physics realism. I will try again with the most realistic option and update this review if there is improvement.Watch a real Wheel Loader at work and see if you agree:https://youtu.be/bKXIO4HMd-MFlawed mission designSo if we are going to struggle to load one brick at a time, what's the point of using a heavy lifter? A human being could do a far better and quicker job; just throw the bricks onto the truck! Anyway i'm gonna try to finish this job 'coz i hate myself. No really i just want to see what's up next and next and so on.GraphicsThe 2nd job shows the range of atmospheric and time effects. It takes place in dark rainy conditions. The ground is wet, shiny and slippery so it isn't just eye candy, there are physical effects on vehicle handling.Career ProgressionThere's continuity and a persistent world in that the construction yard is in the same mess as you left it before in the previous job so that's an interesting twist of small strategic element. Your previous vehicle remain the same color and you can choose a different color for your next vehicle. I presume that in advanced stages you could either have color coded fleet or uniformity for your fleet.Avatar functionThe avatar doesn't seem to have any useful function to manipulate objects so that the mess you made can be rectified and re-arranged neatly or to kick objects into the pit. Even if you could kick or bump objects around, its awkward movement and control makes it impractical. It's only purpose seem to be to personalise the career mode. Perhaps it can be used to corral the bricks into sizable heaps so that the Wheel Loader can pick it up more easily.Incidentally the avatar's jumping motion isn't smooth nor believable but it's funny and it has some semblance of MJ style of moonwalking when walking backwards. No side-stepping in 3rd person view....Third update (regarding the Flawed mission)My bad, the bricks are larger than the common red bricks found on non-loadbearing brickwalls; it's too heavy for a man to lift. I tried kicking it... wouldn't budge so we are back to scouring the ground for scattered bricks. Therefore it's still a flawed mission IMO.... 4th update (Flawed mission - not really)Ok so i was a bit hasty with preconceived notions that it would be too difficult or tedious. Reason is twofold. First it wasn't so hard once realistic physics is applied and you take advantage of a bit forward momentum when scooping bricks. 2nd reason is that you needn't collect all the bricks lying on the ground and enough bricks are around to practice scooping techniques....End of 4th update.End of update (about 2nd job)SummationBought this in PlayWay Sim bundle so it's a good deal. Haven't seen any game breaking bug. Of course it's a little too early to tell as i have not completed the game yet. Most of the time was spent trying to find the right settings for my notebook PC.Only 1 minor bug encountered in the beginning during the short tutorial; the mouselook was inverted when on foot in first person perspective. External vehicle view has no problem rotating the right way. Had to delete profile and recreate a new one for the problem to disappear. I hope it doesn't recur later in the Career,So far no regrets buying at this low price, Worth it i think. You can even customize your own music playlist but it has to be in ogg format. So if you want to squeeze a bit more performance, you can use a lower bit rate for the music files.Despite its quirkiness, it's a fun game with refreshing and upbeat music, the likes of which was heard in Capitalism Plus. Its clunky handling can be mitigated somewhat by careful use of movement keys and bucket loads of patience.Score? hmm maybe 6.5/10... revised to 7.5/10 after completing job #2.addendumHere is a recently updated video of what was mentioned about the 2nd job.http://dai.ly/x4lpl0r"

Cameras however are not laid out at all. Switching between views has added more functionality to pong than it has to this.Can I has a refund?"

Not only is the interface difficult to navigate and the controls almost impossible to use, the game takes longer than it should to load or render certain areas. Crashed twice in the 10 mins I attempted to play it. If it wasn't part of a 79¢ bundle, I would have tried to get a refund through Steam."

76561198067308148,Not Recommended,252050,13206707,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,Trauma,"When I purchased Construction Machines 2014, I tried my best to ignore the mostly negative reviews in hopes that it would be a really cool game I could enjoy. I've gotta say I should have listened to the reviews. I love the premise of the game: you're a construction business owner and you have to perform ""contracts"" (in which each contract is a small task like moving rocks or picking up bricks) to earn more money, buy new machines to have fun with and ultimately expand your business. The prospect of the new tasks are fun, but once it comes time to actually do them it just leaves you disappointed and actually frusturated.The controls are very sensitive yet completely unresponsive at the same time. For example, if you're attemting to gently manuever the front end loader around a rock so you don't hit it, just tapping the turning keys lightly doesn't turn the vehicle at all. However if you hold the key in for a slight second longer it turns the vehicle almost all of the way. One would believe performing pinpoint manuevers is a necessity in a cluttered construction yard but this game won't allow for it. Oh, it's worth mentioning if you actually DO run over the rock or obstacles you were trying to avoid, the physics are so bad that the whole truck behaves like a stiff piece wood with no shock absorbers at all and it just looks pathetic rigidly shaking around over what you just hit. The engines sound like a lawn tractor and they don't change noises based on your engine RPM's or activity, it just sounds like it's a constant idle. The music is so bad and repetitive I actually just shut it off completely and listened to the constantly-idling engine which then became annoying in itself. The graphics on the ""high"" setting also resemble that of a bad Nintendo 64 game but the camera angles are so frusturating to deal with so you barely get to see any of the poor graphics anyway!All in all it was a supurb idea that was poorly delivered in every way shape or form. I give it a 2 out of 5 for the excellent concept but totally poor construction (pun intended.) Save your hard-earned money and purchase something else gamers!"
