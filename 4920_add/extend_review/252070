,Recommended,252070,7705503,"Posted: 20 November, 2013",all,[|||] Magnum Force,"Gimbal, is a nice looking 2D space shooter that has a lot going on underneath the hood. At first glance it looks like one of many ordinary space shoot'em up games, but as soon as you unlock the so called hangar option a new dimension opens up.Within the hangar players are able to construct their own personal space fighter to do battle on one of the many maps. With each level progression the player unlocks new parts which become available at the hangar screen.Much, if not most, of Gimbal's power is due to this feature and sometimes you're spending more time construting and tweaking your ship than actually playing a map.The maps which are at your disposal are okay and look nice. Each map comes in 2 versions: normal and mini.Another good thing about Gimbal is the option to host your own server, add bots to it (This allows for Co-Op and solo play) and to adjust almost any setting to your liking.Controls are another league of their own. I haven't seen that many games that allow for just ""You got a key, button or axis to use? press, jiggle it."" That's a very nice feauture, because with the many weapons and construction options at your disposal, controlling that killer ship can become a science of its own.But, it's not all sunschine with Gimbal, it actually has one huge flaw. And that's the level cap. First of all there're just a hadful of levels/ranks you can gain: about 4. And as a result you're pretty soon done gaining ranks and earning parts. Which is another downer for Gimbal. Although the hangar is just the thing to use, you soon realise that it's not perfect. There're not enough parts. With a game as Gimbal you want 1000 and more parts, 200+ weapon choices and so one and so one. You don't just want to build fighters. You want to construct a Star Destroyer... Not gonna happen, not allowed.True, it's a lot of work to creat a game with such options, I won't deny that, but a game like Gimbal needs at least some modding support so players can add their own parts and designs. Without that option its life span is rather short.On the other hand, with the low price tag you can't go wrong with Gimbal.All things work just perfect, no bugs, just not enough construction parts in the end."

,Recommended,252070,7759215,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Aze,"This game is an incredible combination of fast paced combat and detailed ship design.Combat:Combat is fun and, at times, thrilling.  Some imbalances exist, especially on the ""newb"" servers-but there isn't anything that       skill and design can't overcome.  The design of your ships will have a major impact on how you fight.  Build a hulking tank?  You won't be moving much, and will probably need a turret to hit anything.  Build a lightning fast missle boat?  You'll be darting in and out of combat, tactically choosing when to strike, and when to retreat for repairs.  Controls are 100% customisable and never hinder gameplay.Design:Ship design is deep, although slightly restrictive.  You start by choosing an airframe, essentially determining your base stats (a ""class"" if you will).  Due to some imbalances, the larger airframes are rarely used, but eventually this should be fixed.  On this base you can attach weapons, thrusters, structures, machines, and more.  Realistic(ish) physics mean the interactions between parts and the locations of your thrusters will play very important roles.  Other components are simpler, but still require careful contemplation on how to balance the monetary and spatial constraints, while maximizing combat output.Progression:As you play you progress through four ranks, increasing your budget with kills and wins, and unlocking new technology each rank up.  Reaching max level is not difficult, and can easily be achieved in a single day-perfect for those with less time to sink, but who still want to compete.  On the other hand, it is possible to reset your rank, gaining ""cool points"" and rejoining the newbs.  While this provides no tangible advantages, releveling can be quite fun.  You can design ships for every price range, and master flight of the weakest platforms.  Additionally, its sometimes more fun to fight with weak ships than powerhouses, as skill becomes even more important.Multiplayer:The game is currently focused on multiplayer, and suffers because of it.  The lack of players means only 2-3 servers are ever really full and fun.  Fortunately you can add bots to liven the game up when few people are on.  Other than a poor player base multiplayer is a smooth experience.  Hosting is easy, and provides a plethora of options affecting gameplay.  Joining is even easier, especially when connecting to the official servers.TL;DR:Help us out by buying the game and increasing community size!  If you're still on the fence there's a demo available on the game's website, where you'll also find the forums."
76561198082429378,Recommended,252070,14801579,"Posted: 8 March, 2015",all,Rocketcat241,"First off i want to say this is one of the most fun games i've played.Gimbal is a top-down, high-atmospheric (or space) game in which you build ships to destroy other ships. The ships are fully customizable. There are many maps and gamemodes to try.You start off with $1500T and you earn more by destroying ships. When you reach a certain amount of money you rank up and unlock new parts to build with. Once you hit $6000T you can reset back down (you can only do this once) and after you get past $6000T again you unlock ""MasterMind mode"". This is where you can have as much money as you can get, there is no cap.For now it isn't a very active game, so once you reach mastermind it can get boring, because the bots cap at $6000T and you 1 shot all of them. If anybody is on the servers though (which there is usually at least 2 people on for now) it is a lot more fun.The developer listens to everybody, and tries to add in anything that is suggested. There is a very good forum where you can talk about anything in the game. There is a very good community, most people are nice.That is pretty much it, I highly recommend the game to anybody."
,Recommended,252070,18231245,"Posted: 27 September, 2015",all,PurpleSkyHoliday,"I honestly Believe this game gets a bad wrap from a fair amount of its players, so there's a few things you'll need to know before you buy.Don't mistake this game for SPAZ. A lot of the enjoyment from this game will come from building ships. If that's not your thing, This isn't your thingThe playerbase is quite small, and the game is rather bad at a public competetive setting, anywho. Ensure you have friends who are also interested in the game. For some, there's fun to be had on your own, but I Highly Recommend the 4-pack for friends who are interested. (It's Four for the Price of two, Thats freakin awesome!)Some people seem to think the game caps out when your ship budget reaches 6000. THIS IS NOT TRUE. On the main menu, once you reach 6000 Trillion, an atom-like Icon will appear, which will allow you to (For lack of a better word) Prestige, and then enter mastermind once you've earned your 6000 back. (Allowing you to continue progessing past 6000 trillion)The control scheme is not terrible, you're terrible. I'm not being sarcastic here. The effectiveness of the controls is completely affected by how well-made your ship is and what ship software you use.Don't forget to rebind everything to WASD! controls are not able to be edited from the main menu, because everything is bound to different parts of the ship, you can edit your controls from the hangar.Interested? here's some stuff the game has to offerRidiculously Customizable Ships, Ridiculously. Although Ships are required to have a base, They can be expanded upon extremely. Every Functional Part can be bound to a different key if you wish, or the same keys to effect. There are NO restrictions, barring your budget, on what your ship can be composed of.An impressive 2D Physics Engine, Including Robocraft-Esque individual Part Damage, Bullets with force that will not only cause recoil, pushing back the firing ship, but also push back the one getting shot. (Machine Gun Boosters!), and all matter of other physics goodies like light ships spinning the hell out when they collide with debris or other ships. (I've built way too many ships that are purely designed on smashing into people, too many)More than 4 Different weapon types (I'm looking at you, robocraft) That ensures that Rock-Paper-Scissors matchups never occur. There are a whole manner of weapons, which, in my hours of playing, I've unlocked about 15-20 so far.A well made trade-off system that intergrates naturally into the games engine, light vehicles are naturally light, heavy vehicles are naturally heavy, and require more thrust to move at speed, heavier thrusters aren't as agile, and thus heavy and light vehicles are formed.An array of ship 'software' That allows you to make ships as simple or difficult to master as you like, giving a nice toss up between more guns/armour/boosters/machinery and needing a bit more finesse to control and use your ship effectively, or an easier ride. This includes stuff like stabilizers, which will automatically retro-thrust the rockets on your ship designed for rotating and steering to stop you from spinning once you stop turning, Targeters, which bind to turrets and cause them to follow your mouse, Salvo Modules, which allow you to control whether guns fire all at once or consecutively, and more.Ridiculous antics with friends from ship designs that range from flat out stupid, to almost too effective, to downright maniacal (But probably with a massive weakness)If I had to describe this game, I'd note it as a 2D, Top-down space shooter, like SPAZ, but focusing heavily on ship creation and customization, similar to robocraft, but more complex and requiring a bit more consideration, like Kerbal Space Program (Don't Worry, You're already in space, and it's 2D, it's not as hard). And the artstyle is similar to that of FTL. Sprite-Based ships and parts, detailed non-pixelated backgrounds.However, adversely to robocraft, it's system is significantly more in-depth because Gimbal Lacks the Limitations of Robocraft's blocky unity engine. For example, as noted, ship bases can be expanded upon with structural extensions and armour, but also can utilize an array of machinery parts such as the tether gun (Which allows you to attach to another ship, trapping them, or alternatively, tow your teammates to safety), Extenders, which allow parts of the ship to extend and retract at will. Turrets, Which allow parts of the ship to Rotate at will (Mostly for ships that require guns to turn without the rest of the ship, eg, a ship with armour on just one side), Attractors and repulsors, for such antics as firing into your own attractor orbit, causing a circle of bullet doom, and then ramming into another ship, causing them to collide with bullet-based space debris. There are even bolts that allow for segments of the ship to be detonated, for staged ships, such as tanks that, once they've sustained too much damage, can escape with their lives by detonating all of their heavy partsOverall, I've had a ton of fun with this game so far, But it IS really reliant on it's multiplayer elements.Main Menu GUI: 5/10In-Game GUI: 7.5/10AI ship designs and programming: 7.5/10Music: I'm not gonna give this one a score, just take my word for the fact it is really quite average.Creative Freedom: 9/10Ship Customization: 9.9/10, the 2D nature means it's a bit difficult to attach parts how you want sometimes, but thats a nitpick.Tutorial: 0/10.

It has a number of modes, including death match, team deathmatch, and racing. It has unlocks and progression. It has an appealing art-style and sense of scale to it. Unfortunately, the one thing it does not have is a player base. At this current time, there are nine servers running, with a combined total of twelve players. The best match I could make was a 3v2 team deathmatch, rounded out by bots. A real shame. With a strong player count, I would recommend this. With an iffy player count (or if you can't arrange a number of people to play with on your own hosted server), I'd have to say there might not be a lot of value to it."

It can be hard to get used to but for the most part it's easy to understand and easy to play. However I do have a few problems with the game as some of the weapons are a bit to powerful and the small number of servers can be hard to deal with  but other than that I think that this little gem deserves more attraction.PS, the game can get laggy at times when people are using massive capital ships but for the most part the huge number of explosions and bright colours are sure to keep pyromainics playing for as long as they can."

However, there are matchmaking options so you dont get put in to a game with people that are building monster ships. The game uses semi-newtonian physics.

It's a 2D Top-Down Space Shooter set in the upper atmosphere; as such, you need to deal with manuverability via thrusters, but aerodynamics are still a factor.The game itself is enjoyable, but the real fun comes into the ship building aspect; there are many different ship types, weapons, gear, software and armour to choose from. Want rotating turrets? You can have that. Want to attach yourself to enemy ships so that you can destroy them close up? It's possible.The only real downside is the leveling system; it takes a while to level up (which is the only way to get new parts.) There is also a budget system, which limits how much you can put on it (ship space can also be an issue.)) You increase your budget by killing people in explosive fashion.They could fix this in my opinion by making it easier to level up or simply removing the leveling system and retaining only the budget system, but that's just me.Overall, the game is very much worth more than the asking price.

If the idea of having a lot of control over tiny details in your ship is appealing you'll probably like this.When I've played there are always less than 100 or so people on. It's hard to play with people of similar skill level and the bots range from brain dead to impossible.

Build a ship using a variety of parts (the higher the level, the more you unlock) and fight.Things break down pretty fast though.  First, there is a cheat to get yourself to maximum level virtually instantly. (Check the Community Hub for details.)  In fact, you apparently need this cheat because any other players out there are also max level, and if you want your ship to be competitive you need the best parts.Single player mode (set up your own server and fill it with bots) exists...but really the game is supposed to shine in multiplayer.  The problem is there's no such critter.  There are only a handful of public servers/maps, and the most players I've ever seen on at one time are two.In the end, there's no value here.  There are plenty of games out there where you can upgrade your soldier/fighter/spaceship, with a cheaper point of entry, and more players.  Nice idea, but if three months after release (as I write this) the community doesn't exist, it's not going to."

Exact placement of some ship parts is neccessary to improve the design, but not mandatory. It's up to you.

When you get there, you are probably just going to run up against a guy who found a way to mount dozens of guns and blows you away because there is not a whole lot of balancing factors in the game to prevent them from pulling stuff like that.Good thing I got it on the cheap, as games like Gimbal tend to taunt me by being really cool core ideas that are being leveraged ineffectively."

76561197970490424,Recommended,252070,12039179,"Posted: 9 September, 2014",all,Juffo-Wup,"Gimbal is one of the coolest games in years that nobody is playing. Multiplayer (the core of the game) is *almost* dead, sometimes there will be 0 players, sometimes there will be 2 or 3, and if you're REALLY lucky there will be 6 people on 1 server.The new ""Mastermind"" patch which removed the money cap for building ships has hurt the game imo. There used to be a strategy behind building ships with the limited funds, but now whoever has the most ingame money wins because they can mount the most guns/armor. Also the servers/game engine cant even support these rediculous unlimited fund ships, the game lags to unplayable levels or sometimes crashes when someone uses an unlimited fund gunship. There NEEDED to be a money cap increase... maybe 2x-3x, but not unlimited. Its also split the few players left... if you are new to the game you have 0 chance against these ""Mastermind"" players, and the Mastermind players dont play on the money capped servers, so now the player base is even more diluted than it was.15 dollars is also steep for this game, if you are a good player you will unlock everything in the game in a day or LESS.However, when players are on even ground and you are lucky enough to be on a server with battling players on it, this game is scary fun."

Along with this, I like the interaction between specific weapons and machines. For instance using repulsors and missiles increases their range and speed and can help you gain an edge. Also, because of how the game plays and how numerous the possibilities, the game keeps me coming back for more.However, as the game continues in its development I would like to see the AI improved. At the time of my posting this they seem to be too accurate. They almost always make a hit while human players may struggle to do so without the use of a software attachment on a turret. I would also like to see their navigation improve because sometimes they fly into a narrow space and just spin around in circles and they seem to crash quite often.Over all this is a great game with almost infinate possibilities. I really enjoy it."

76561197970818678,Recommended,252070,14771412,"Posted: 7 March, 2015",all,Nypyren?!?!,"Good game.  Needs single-player content.  Nobody plays it multiplayer anymore.Has occasional performance problems - I experienced this with small ships (not the monster unlimited-budget ships available recently).  Probably related to point-defense targeting on my ship vs. bomb/missile spam as far as I could tell.  Didn't have the patience to diagnose further.If you have a dedicated group of friends to play this with, get it.  If you don't, get Reassembly instead - it's similar to this game (design-your-own top-down 2D spaceship-combat-game), but designed for single-player from the ground up.Side note:  The game lets you share ship designs in .PNG images.  The image portion of the file shows a picture of a ship, but the actual data of the ship design used by the game is stored in a custom PNG chunk in the same file.  This is an *utterly brilliant* idea, and the creator gets major props from a fellow game developer for coming up with this."

Eventually you'll rank up and get access to even more parts. Adopting a new hull you go at it again, trying to learn what works and what doesn't and what's just holarious to use. Later on you'll gain access to mastermind, which with a bit of effort lets you design your own capital ships.From capital ships designed to hurl crates, and fighters packing naval cannons, who's going to question a UFO anymore?"

Turn the ship(or turrets!) via WASD, Arrow Keys(or any keybinding really...), or install a Control chip that allows the thrusters to auto adjust to face the ship(or turrets!) at your mouse position. You can even set up layers of different chips to have semi-automated targeting and firing systems for your turrets. This is just the tip of the iceburg in terms of ship customizability.And after achieving the ""Mastermind"" rank, you can begin building a budget level so you can literally build any size or geared up ship you want.Definite recommend."
