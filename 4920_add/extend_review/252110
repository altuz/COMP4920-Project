Talk about exciting! It kind of reminds me of Star Trek mixed with PixelJunk Shooter. The Star Trek part is how you have to move your character from station to station to control different systems (weapons, sheilds, helm, cannon) and the PixelJunk Shooter part is pretty much everything else! If you're looking for a good co-op game, you've found it.Pros:+ Fantastically original aesthetic.+ Unique gameplay.+ Interesting enemies+ Very challenging, but doesn't feel unfair.+ Simple controls.Cons:-No online co-op. Doesn't really matter to me, but is sure to be a deal-breaker for some."

I thought it'd be nice, and I always dreamed of having a gamer girlfriend. If she wasn't one, then I must simply convert her.It was tough, and we've ran into many bad games trying to find our feet. Sure, you can google or youtube ""best co op games to play with your significant other"" but really, at the end of the day, it's trial and error. You just gotta buy, try, and see if it works.This game is not like that. This game, I bet you my house, will steal your girl. If you're trying to convert your girlfriend to video games, trust me, start with this game.It's hard, but not so hard it'll frustrate a newb. It has perfect balance between co op and skill. What this means is that, both of you to some extent need to know what you're doing, and contribute to the task at hand (running away from the monsters, shooting the baddies, etc) but the more experienced gamer can still carry the team without making the others look useless. It's so much fun. You can calculate EVERY MOVE, but once it gets hectic, it's utter chaos. Incredibly good fun.97.5/100PS follow ""Convert Your Significant Other!"" or CoYoSiOt, my Steam Curator page, if you're interested in finding good games with an emphasis on cooperative play and accessibility to convert your significant other!

,Recommended,252110,18001368,"Posted: 12 September, 2015",all,Torchiest,"LiaDS is a very cool game. You are on a mission to restore love to the galaxy in your spaceship, with either one player and an AI helper, or local co-op. It has a pretty unique gimmick, in that you must move your characters from station to station in order to control parts of the ship you're flying. What this means in practice is that most of the time one person will be flying the ship, while the other moves between the guns and the shields defending you. In special circumstances both players will have to man the defenses while the ship idles.The graphics are super cutesy, and they belie the absolutely punishing difficulty of this game. You'll need a competent second player to match the excellent performance of your AI pet, who zips between stations at your command and just kicks butt on the regular. But when things are in a groove and the chaos is all around you, the game is incredibly satisfying. And the good number of power-up combinations keeps things interesting. Just be prepared for the occasional frustration as the hordes of attackers wipe you out yet again.The unique mechanic of only being able to control one station at a time makes this game feel like a mix between FTL: Faster Than Light and a shoot-em-up. It's honestly inspiring to see such an innovative gameplay concept these days, when it sometimes feels like all the genres possible have been conceived already. Which is to say, I can see this as the foundation of a new genre, much like Minecraft single-handedly brough the crafting genre into existence. It's that good. I found it intriguing enough that I bought it at only a small discount, which is incredibly rare for me.EDIT: Having played this game a few more hours, my estimation of it continues to increase. Rather than getting stale, it's becoming more entertaining the deeper I go. The power up combinations hold some amazing surprises, the music is fantastic, and the game is so well put together and so polished, it's like the distilled essence of joy to play it. I'm willing to call it the best game of the year right now."

,Recommended,252110,31051204,Posted: 9 April,all,Challak,"Summary: A TRUE co-operative experience that's rarely seen. Like another great example, ""Overcooked"", this game has perfectly captured the essence of co-operative play, and player co-ordination through strong communication. Unlike most ""co-op"" games, trying to go it alone, or trying to ""be the best guy"" doesn't fly here. You'll work together, running around a ship, controlling turrets, shields, lasers, and guiding the ship through hazardous space. It's a LOT of fun, and I would say a must buy for local couch co-op.Pros:+ Designed around co-operative play+ Co-op Campaign+ The ""lone wolf"" mentality is rightly the worst choice, as should be the case in a good co-op experience (see Overcooked as another great example of this)+ Quick to learn+ Encourages participation from gamers of a variety of skill levels+ Encourages strong communication between players+ The screen is tidy, and everything sized just right to lend to visual clarity+ Up to 4 players can play at once+ Couch co-op, Steam link works great, and has great controller supportCons:- Not much... the players who like to be ""winning"" will be sadly disappointed, but that makes me VERY happy- Online co-op not supported (I prefer couch co-op, but I ca see this being a drawback for some)"

They are so few and far between that I actually created 2 gaming stations 90 degrees off each other each with its own console and projector so we could play ""online"" together in the same room. Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime was a fantastic antidote to that solution. When you want to play co-op nothing beats being on the same (non-split) screen. This had that. The gameplay is really fun. Challenging not only in terms of enemies, but also the mechanics of play (really cleverly twisted as you go) and the gem combo system is really fun and allows the player to really feel out how they best want to interact with the game. Cannot recommend this game enough!Oh and it's SUPER cute too!"
,Recommended,252110,17961345,"Posted: 9 September, 2015",all,(YouTube)Dragnix,"Summary:Lovers in a Dangerous Space Time is definitely more enjoyable with a friend, as you both work back and forth to take advantage of the unique gameplay on segmented functionality regarding shields/navigation/firing. While the AI follows your orders rather well, the lack of him being able to navigate can lead to gameplay that has pacing problems in that case. The core firing and enemy variety does help the game rather well, and the aesthetic is rather nice without being in your face. Upgrade system is rather nice and interesting in the way it combines weapons. Basically, if you're looking for a local co-op experience to play with a friend in a shoot em up nature: this works rather well.Gameplay Footage and Video Review:http://youtu.be/5JxyEvsr5q8Lists:+:Local Co-Op sets up gameplay that reinforces communication with your partner and creates an environment to get the chat going rather well.Like the upgrade system and the different combinations that can be created from it. Things like the laser mace are interesting in their combination.Aesthetic is nice without being too in your face with colors. The best laid back neon style I've seen in a while.Soundtrack is soothing, not too over the top and fits the game rather well. Good laid back feel.Enemy variety works with different ways of having to deal with them.AI is competent in firing, and in particular in using the shield against the right enemy at the time.-:Really would have done well to have online multiplayer. Again, sensitive to the amount of programming that it would take, but I really think it would have taken this game, which is obviously co-op focused, to the next level.Single player does lack in compared to local co-op experience due to the lack of AI being able to navigate, although understandable given the amount of work to program pathfinding would be.Game can feel samey rather quickly. In particular, the game's pace is rather slow. Action players may find the game hard to get into."

The gameplay is solid, the art is splendid, and the story is enjoyable fluff. And here, you actually need your partner. Even when this means certain doom, it makes for a better experience.The early levels don't expect too much and are great for easing in a partner relatively new to games, but later on (especially the last campaign or two) you may want to switch to easy. Easy mode may still almost guarantee a win in those later campaigns, but it won't ruin the sense of accomplishment through cooperation.If you are playing with someone that doesn't play games quite as much, you may find yourself more pigeonholed into certain roles (especially piloting and shielding), but you'll still find time to move about to the weapons systems. More importantly, you'll both be having fun.Single-player is fine enough, but it will feel a little lacking if you've played with someone else. That's not really a fault of the game, as the AI partner performs well (and better than anyone I played with). It's just not as compelling as having a human to work with (and around), someone who isn't there just to obey your whims."

It would be nice to play some local co-op games before I leave, and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime had given us a enjoyable experience.The first time we launched the game it was from my brother's Steam account, so we stopped halfway through the first cutscene to change to my account, which owns the game, just so I can get some trading cards and achievements.Both times we watched to first cutscene, my bother would always tell me that I'm gay. Maybe because it's called ""Lovers"" in a Dangerous Spacetime, but I had figured it was fine to play with my brother.The first boss we came across taught us that the game would be a ton more challenging that it seeemed. We had died an enless amount of times to that boss, because we lacked coordination. My brother, a true lover of the Souls franchise (I am one too), complained that the bosses were way too hard, and ""I'd rather finish our Kirito and Asuna builds in Dark Souls 2."" But I convinced him to keep trying, well, more like I forced him to.By the time we defeated the second boss, which was suprisingly easy, our coordination had improved signifigantly. We would man the turrents, the shields, and drive at the same time. Still, we often found ourselves rushing to the love portal at the end of the level with the tiniest skimp of health.In summary, the game has you and your friends working together in different roles to defeat the antilove monsters, and though this shared experience will reinforce relationships as well as build new ones. Of course, it is frustratingly dificult, but that just means you and your friends will feel more acomplished when you win. Don't be fooled by the title of the game, play it with your guy friends or gal friends. Heck, why not all of your friends in 4-player co-op? (assuming you only have four friends, which I totally feel ya). Very fun and frustrating local co-op. 8.5/10Oh, and by the way, we did play this on two player co-op normal mode.""Just restart the level until we get the last metal gem we need to wreck the boss with our rocket launchers! They do soooo much damage OPOP."""

It's a game about flying a spaceship and rescuing space critters, with every player manning a different station. For example, someone might be stearing, while another is on shields, and another on a turret. It's such a cool concept, and it's executed phenomenally well. Switching between stations is fast and easy, and all of the controls are simple and intuitive.The three difficulties encompass pretty much every playstyle there is; with easy being almost impossible to die in, normal being challenging but fair, and hard/veteran being hard enough that you're almost guaranteed to die a few times.The music in this game is incredible. This game would have been perfectly fine if there was some generic, relaxing ""space"" music in the background, but they decided to do more than that. Some of the tracks are reminiscent of Hotline Miami. Almost kind of odd considering how cutsy this game is, but it works and sounds great (look up ""ost Crystal C""). And the boss themes are intense and get the heart pounding (my favourite is ""Orion"").The graphics are beautiful to look at and everything animates extremely smooth. It can be eye candy in some parts. I should also mention that while this game is meant to be played with a friend or significant other, it's still fun to play the game by yourself. If played solo, you get an npc that you can tell to man different stations. The AI is good enough that you never get frustrated with it; it's honestly better than most real people I've played this with.In conclusion, this game is well worth the $15 asking price, and a steal when it goes on sale. So do yourself a favor and pick this up. You won't regret it! (probably)"

,Recommended,252110,24467678,"Posted: 22 July, 2016",all,Pirate,"I've seen a preview of this game years ago. When I found out it's finally coming out I couldn't wait. I bought it on release without thinking.Oh man, did this game DELIVER.I love coop games and this is pretty much the pinnacle of what I've seen. It is currently my No. 1 favourite coop game of all time. It dethroned Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light and that's quite an achivement in my book.Most games have tacked-on coop modes that many times just don't work. This a true coop experience and everything is built around it. You can play solo but it's rather boring since you'll be flying the ship 90% of the time while an AI partner will do most of the more interesting stuff (like shooting !). I also didn't play 3 or 4-player coop so I can't tell how good that is. The core 2 player experience is insane though.The game is so action packed you'll forget you had real-life stuff to do. Every level is a constant scramble to man the necessary stations. It's almost like there's not enough people on your ship, but that's what makes it so fun to pull off. You need to fly the ship, angle the shields and shoot 4 guns all at the same time and enemies just keep on coming.There's a surprising amount of variation on subsystem upgrades (guns, shields etc.) and you can tweak your ship to fit your playstyle.Levels are semi-randomized. You get the same opponents and similar obstacles but the layout changes. It's not the level of some other games but enough to keep the levels from becoming a chore to repeat if you fail.Each campaing has a different theme and ends in a pretty cool and challenging boss fight. Each level also has a different twist on the theme.There's 3 different ships (2 unlock later) plus the one you start with gets a few upgrated versions later on. One of the other ships is kind of weird and not everybody will be able to play it though. I don't wanna spoil here but is a little mind bending. Makes some people dizzy. I'd kind of like some more ships but it's not that big of a deal.It is local coop only and many people complain about it. It's understandable and a valid point but I would like to add that I feel like this game would not be that fun if you weren't sitting next to your partner. Online coop is great - but it's not the same.So if you have somebody to play with I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this. Worth every penny."

Somehow Asteroid Base have managed to design something that looks cute, sharp, vibrant and colourful, yet doesn't feel childish or cringeworthy.This is without a doubt one of the best coop-games I have ever played. Especially because it allows you to have lots of fun right from the start. Unlike some other games, where it only really opens up if you reached a certain level or got a particular upgrade.My only complaint from the 3 hours I have played thus far is that the upgrade system can be a bit unclear at times.

Watching the trailers, I knew I'd like the co-operative gameplay, but I was afraid it would be too visually confusing. Playing the game, my fears were unfounded. The visual style isn't just cutesy, it's very well thought through, down to little touches like the ship counter-rotating slightly when you move the engines. The design works really well, and the UI doesn't get in the way.I've only tried it in a team of four, all with controllers, and it was well-balanced for that; I'm not sure if it compensates you when you have fewer players.

So much, that the game is infinitely more rewarding with more friends to play. By that token, buys beware: it is highly recommended you bring additional passengers for this ride!Great presentation and audio make this an endearing package, with gameplay that is simple to understand, but hard to master as the levels progress. It is evident that an enormous amount of effort was invested into LiaDS, a sediment which is echoed by excellent aethestics, difficulty progression, and engaging gameplay.A few gripes do not escape this game from a hearty recommendation. Gamers who are wishing for a forgiving game will be marginally dissapointed, as after a couple hours of gameplay, the level of challenge ramps up significantly. Game levels become long, and trecherous. A misfired cannon, or an unmanned engine can potentionally lead to demise; a loss of 20-30 minutes of gameplay to restart the level.By inverse, the game is rewarding. If you can progress in the game with enough skill and determination, you are rewarded with more gadgets and enemys to test the might of your friends and yourself.If you are interested in a well-constructed, engaging, and fun local multiplayer game, look no further.

I highly recommend this game to anyone that has a friend to play with locally.For singleplayer though, I suggest you look elsewhere.  I suggest you watch some reviews first before making this purchase.From a singleplayer perspective, the gameplay does not flow smoothly; it feels very ""stuttery"".  There is quite a bit of micromanaging in this game, during battles you:  command pet to a position, move your ship, move your shields, hop onto a turret to shoot a bit, and then repeat.  Throughout the fight you're not feeling engaged in the combat, it's more about moving around so you don't get hit and let your pet do the shooting.  Overall it is just not fun, well to me anyways, to just move a ship around and not being involved in the combat while the A.I. does everything else.If this were just a singleplayer game only, this game would get a ""thumbs down"", but since there is local co-op and everything about this game is very unique from art style to (co-op) gameplay, this will get ""thumbs up""."

The aesthetics are pleasing, a good contrasting color palette set in space, with cute characters and badass weaponry.This is definitely a challenge and we joked about it being a test for relationships. This kind of is.You have to communicate well as you and your partner navigate levels in space, each portion of the ship has to be manually controlled (except for one cannon, you just press the button).

There was some frustrated yelling at times, but that is the way it should be in a local co-up game. As you pilot your ship through the different constellations, fighting the forces of Anti-Love you experience a nice variety of worlds. We thought for a second that we had found a ""winning"" gem combination after having easily glided through a few levels in a row, only to have to rethink our strategy as the environment around us changed. (Curse you ice constellation!)I have also played a bit of the solo game and found the cat ai to be a very decent, and agreeable, copilot. Though if I had to choose my boyfriend remains a better shield controller. The choices the ai makes aren't always the one you could wish for.The game is overflowing with cuteness and color, the difficulty increase in a good way to keep you sharp, and the random map creation and different gem builds is nice for replay-ability.

I'm on pace to complete the game in ~5 hours total. To me, infinite replay would come with an FTL style galactic conquest with some randomness to the bosses. The levels are already very well generated, and I would love a sort of rogue-lite perma-death randomly generated campaign. That would definitely keep me coming back, since I don't know what the incentive would be to beat the campaign for a second time.The only reason I'm harping on the replayability is because I enjoy the game so much that I want to see more game modes that will give me a reason to play it for 100+ hours."

The concept is simple: fly around the star system, save the inhabitants of that particular galaxy (so far, I've encountered bunnies, frogs, and foxes) collect the gears needed, and fight the boss, but with the brilliant way the co-op is implemented it becomes a very addictive and fun action game.Definitely, definitely play with a friend for this one, as it's pretty much half the fun of this game when one of you is piloting the ship and trying to run around not punching each other off stations when the enemies are shooting at you.

We don't get awesome co-op games like this one that often.The goal of every stage is to collect space bunnies.Only con this game has is that it lacks any kind of option for online multiplayer. (Okay, maybe another con is that, being an indie game made with Unity and all, it may not be appealing to AAA weeaboos who play games for nothing more than realistic graphics and Japanese anime fanservice.)Despite its aesthetics, this is not a casual game. Not the most brutal game by any means, but its difficulty might still turn some people off, unless, played with friends.While I think it's foolish not to implement online features in a multiplayer-centric game (if it's within the capabilities of the devs), I do understand the sheer difficulty of just doing anything online and multiplayer.

The confusion of chosing battle-stations is lots of fun, as is learning to work together smoothly. Good co-op expirience all the way. Works well from 2 players. Not a single player, imo.It's overly cute and sugar-coated in nice, but so excusable, likable even...Other: GF and PG-young approved."

It is a game that requires cooperation, and I would say the more players, the better it will be. The game is very strange with controls and so far when I have tried to change them, it just messed with everything else. But when I used wired controllers with default settings, all was well. Very much worth purchasing"

If I had two requests, though, I think it would be cool to have a score mode, or a way to tally up how people do on each of their stations and be given their progress at the very end of each level. Also, this game is too short! It's super fun and a recommended must-have for anyone looking for good co-op/small group fun in a PC game :)"
