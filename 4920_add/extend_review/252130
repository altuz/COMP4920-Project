The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.Game AudioI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even if it's simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.GameplayThere are no difficult modes to choose from but each of the levels has their own difficulty.There are five worlds with thirty levels in total six hundred levels. All levels has three stars to earn.There's an option for resetting the level if an error has been made. All levels can be replayed to earn all three stars. The first world is automatically unlock but the other four worlds are locked. They required a certain amount of stars to unlock them.New game mechanics are introduced into the game as it progresses. As it being said the puzzles will certainly get tricky to solve.There nineteen achievements to earned but each has a requirement before they can be unlocked.MiscellaneousThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend.

Then I saw that it had been ported to Steam and was excited beacuse it had achievements, and I love achievements, and it was Mac compatible so I could play it on my laptop. I played through the entire first world (in full screen because there's no windowed mode) and did not get a single one of the corresponding achievements. They just don't work on Mac.Since the game hadn't been out on Steam that long, I emailed the devs to make sure they knew about the problem and ask if they would fix it. They said they had no idea there was an issue and they'd look into it. Months later, no update, I email again and am told the devs have moved on. They just made a quick and dirty minimal work required port and have no intention of fixing any issues with it or ever revisiting this game ever again, despite the interest of many customers. I have no respect for that type of developer and do not intend to purchase games from them in the future."

It seemed like a nice little puzzle game, but ultimately it got too aggravating to play for one very simple reason.No windowed mode.On a puzzle game, this is not acceptable. I should not be boxed away entirely from everything else I'm doing just so I can focus entirely on a calm, casual puzzle game. Hell, I don't like being boxed away from everyone else for ANY game, but with a puzzle game such as this, that's particularly problematic. It wouldn't even work with DxWnd.I held onto this game for a while in the hopes windowed mode would be added later. However, the developer seems to have taken a very ""Fire and forget"" approach to this game, and has actually admitted he's too lazy to implement a windowed mode.http://steamcommunity.com/app/252130/discussions/0/517142892060966035/I am sorry, but if the developer isn't making time for us by updating thier mobile port with something so small as a windowed mode, and is outright saying it to people's faces, I'm not making time for the developer.

Yes, you also divide.Let me get it out of the way: this is a blatant mobile port that nonetheless ends up working ok with a mouse.The basic mechanics have you throw groups of critters from one island to the next, with the goal of satisfying 3 requests in each, be it save an exact amount of them or kill a certain number. These requests are tied to the layout of the map and require you to move around the animals until you've satisfied them all in sequence.You can merge groups on a single island (2 sheeps + 3 sheeps = 5 sheep!) as well as ""decrease them"" by throwing more than an island can take and drowning the excess. I should also mention that youliterallydivide sheep with laser grids. In half. A bloody half. And two halves make a whole, don't forget!Things get more complex as the game gives you more critters who interact differently with one another (wolves eat all others, pigs squash sheeps, the golden idol that exists somehow squashes everything...) as well as different types of islands that disappear when left empty or burn any visitor.While the game is fun, it doesn't have a very good progression; the difficulty varies wildly from one stage and the next, but it somehow manages to be fun for the most part.I have to point out that it does overstay its welcome by a couple dozen stages; the last world adds slightly uninspired elements that were most likely added just to increase the duration of the game. The achievement structure also suggests this: the ""get everything"" unlocks after the second-to-last world, with one more ""get everything"" unlocking after you're done with the last world as well.All in all, Divide by Sheep is a cute puzzle game, but I wouldn't suggest it to those who don't already love the genre.To such players, go ahead and get it during a discount for a few hours of fun; feel also free to let go when you get bored though: sadly, there's no majestic puzzle design waiting for you in its last phases."

At first it looked like a try-too-hard-to-be-cute mobile puzzler turned quick steam port cash grab, and it is indeed a port, but oh was I wrong.  From the opening cinematic you know things are slightly off. It reminded me of Happy Tree Friends, turning the cute visuals into a sometimes gruesome scene.  Usually I'm put off by things like this, but this game nails it.  The soundtrack is not something you'd probably throw on while not playing the game, but it is very entertaining.Down to the gameplay itself:  This is actually one of few puzzle games that I've been infuriatingly stumped by, making the success that much more satisfying.  As the name suggests, the puzzles revolve directly around math and sheep.  Also wolves, lazers, trampolines, and lots of death.

Not very challenging (I'm currently at world 3) but it's not designed to be. You can clear most levels in a few minutes without focusing only on the game.The gameplay is definitely there, and evolving during your playtrought, since new platforms and mechanics are making their appearance with each new world. They are also very nicely introduced. I have absolutely nothing to say against the learning curve.The art is cute. Music is getting really annoying really fast, but well I wasn't expecting a 10 out of 10 at this price, and  I guess it makes sense since the game is not designed to be played during long periods of time. It's not a problem thought, since you can just disable it and keep the sounds effects.I'd say you would need like 1 hour/world if you intend to finish it with all stars for each stage, at least for the 3 first world. Therefore I'm not expecting more than 5-6 hours of gameplay with this one.Would definitely recommend it, if it was a mobile game.The pc port is awfull. You can't customize anything, not even launch this in windowed mode. The UI is unnecessary huge and so on.

But then I'm no fan of match-3 games either.The one nice thing it does is that it lets you literally divide sheep in half (you can set the amount of gore from the main menu). Other than that, it's a straight-up puzzler that I think of as a ""labyrinth"" game: figure out the correct sequence of actions to reach your goal. Some levels have multiple ways to achieve that, but there's no reward for choosing one over the  other. I should also mention that the difficulty ramps up nice and even over the first 30 levels (of 150), and that new mechanics are introduced with little more than a picture hint and an opportunity for the player to research what they do in the next level (that's good).A small nigle(steam doesn't let me spell this word correctly)I hold against it is that the game seems to favor playing by trial and error: when I want to do it perfectly and figure out a master plan before starting to move the sheep around, the game slows me down by making me do each hop (and animation) separately instead of doing broad sweeps: I wish I could swipe a group of sheep over several hops at once, or maybe swipe a circle on a group of islands and have every group make a hop to the neighboring island. Instead it is hop-wait-hop-wait, and precisely because the game avoids such grander mechanics, it's casual. Oh, and if you didn't turn the music off after 10 minutes I admire your patience. [There's more information on the music in the comments.]I don't regret paying 0.99 for this game (it is 80% off), but I had hoped for something more memorable which it ultimately isn't.

It's got cute colors and a catchy tune while also undercutting that overbearing sweetness with some violence and a quirky, dark story (simply and unobtrusively told through the occasional quick slide show).The puzzles escalate beautifully and, while never holding your hand, the game starts you off extremely simply and takes you through increasingly complicated scenarios until, by the end of the game, you have a complete understanding of everything and are able to utilize the game's weird toolset to your advantage.  The puzzles get quite clever and what may be an obstacle to work around in one level will be made into a vital asset in another, simply as an emergent property of the interaction of simple rulesets.Simply a great puzzle game."

It really makes you think about your moves as it slowly adds in more elements. only on 2-6 so far but i find it hard to STOP playing. the puzzles are very clever and well thought out and once you find yourself feeling like you have the answer you realize you made mistake, thankfully it's a little forgiving as there are no move goals. Just 'save' goals and duct tape (when you play you will see what i mean)it controls very well, being originally for ap stores, but works very nicely on here anyways. It also doesnt do any hand holding, just a easy stage for you to get how the new element to the puzzle system works then drops you right back into the brain teasers. Though really, it is not all that hard to understand so long you remember your math. I found myself drawing out the puzzles a couple times on graph paper so i could keep track, but that is jsut cuz i tried to figure it out ahead of time. It's simpler to just figure out on go.the design fits the game itself to. which jsut helps with the fact it makes me laugh a lot as i play. I DO NOT SUGGEST THIS FOR SENSITIVE KIDS...especially those who like sheep...trust me. not for them. good gaame, but 'no sheep were harmed in the marking of this game' should ""apply"" if you get what i mean.worth the buy, especially if you love puzzle games. this one is great and well thought out and very goofy."

An explanation/tutorial what does what is basiclly non-existant, if something new is introduced in a level, you usually have to fail the level once just trying to figure out what it does (and sometimes it doesn't make sense, like the ""split-jump-pads"" that always shoot a single sheep into the same direction instead of randomly to the left and right). It also doesn't make sense that you're not rewarded if you save all sheep without sacrifycing any. The music - it's upright annoying, it's like a 30 second-loop, repeated over and over again. Play the game for two hours, and you will want to kill the composer. But most of all, the game is not FUN. It doesn't have the slightest surprising moments, it never makes you laugh because something unexpected ot ""cute"" happened.

It is, at its core, a puzzle/logic game. Don't let the mathiness intimidate you, if you are wont to be intimidated by mathiness. Players are able to engage in unlimited trial and error to sort out each level, as needed. Nevertheless, there have been 2 times (so far) that I've resorted to YouTube'ing a level to complete it (that's 2xs out of 100+?). So, in my opinion, Divide by Sheep is well balanced; the difficulty increases at an acceptable, steady rate which maximizes fun and minimizes frustration.It *does* get a little repetitive at times, but Divide by Sheep is the sort of game that you can spend a couple of days away from yet come back to again (as opposed to taking a couple days off and forgetting the game exists) because the game really IS fun. Beyond the gameplay, the graphics are another positive point. The design/concepts are pleasantly ironic; there is a certain (and non-morbid) amount of satisfactory stress relief in killing sheep. Well. Not killing. Delivering them to the reaper. *cough* The cuteness of the graphics provides the perfect offset and absurdity level for what you will need to do in order to complete the levels of the game, i.e. kill sheep.One (albeit obscure) criticism is that the comic strip-like stills between levels, which sometimes appear to ""explain"" new features added to an upcoming level, are often rather opaque in the sense that they can be very difficult to make sense of. Thankfully, Divide by Sheep is highly forgiving - you can reset any given level after experimenting to learn about a new platform ""The Hard (but still amusing) Way"". Because of this the, at times confusing, explanatory stills do not pose a significant problem. Consider it a pet peeve.One of the things I found very helpful (even if I didn't often avail myself of the feature because I am a stubborn completionist who will try and try again until I must YouTube because all of the stars) was the ability to wave a surrender flag if/when I was stuck. I appreciated that this was possible even if I did not take advantage of it.This feature would, in theory and practice, allow me to progress through the game (without needing to cheat YouTube walkthroughs) despite only being able to complete one or two out of three deliveries in a given level. The flag waving prevents stuck-ness and provides a lack of gated-ness that many modern puzzle games lack. This feature made Divide by Sheep more inviting and took the pressure off for a not-really-particularly-skilled-at-mental-math sort of person like me. (I'm better with theory. I swear.)I 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a well-made puzzle game and to anyone who is more pedestrian about puzzlers as well. Divide by Sheep IS solidly organized, thought out, and skillfully crafted, yet it remains pleasing for those who are slightly less particular about puzzlers.  There is no game snobbery here. If you insist upon elitism in gaming or consider ""gamer"" as a status symbol, Divide by Sheep isn't for you, probably. This game is pure egalitarian entertainment with logic, fried sheep, half sheep, sheep souls, wolves, TNT, sticky platforms, pigs, YOU NAME IT.PS: As a professional educator, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the educational value of the game - whether for young math learners, older folks warding off the brain fog that comes with aging (I probably qualify for this category), or an ice breaker for ESL students (linguistic demand is low). Divide by Sheep has much potential as a classroom/educational/mental flexibility tool while still being fun enough to not feel like a tool."

The music is catchy but soothing, varying enough with each world to not grate on the nerves.  Well thought-out and fun."

Do you have what it takes to meat (pun intended) the required quota and complete all levels with a perfect rating.A fun and challeging ""mobile"" game. Cheap and it has Steam Trading Cards.

It's reminiscent of the Fox, Goose, and Cabbage problem, but with silly sheep, laser beams, and a lonely Grim Reaper that you must outwit with math skills. Save the sheep!"
