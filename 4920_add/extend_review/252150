,Recommended,252150,8628733,"Posted: 8 January, 2014",all,Tweevle,"Grimm (a.k.a American McGee's Grimm) was originally released on GameTap in weekly episodes, and is made by several of the same people who made American McGee’s Alice and Alice: Madness Returns, principle member being American McGee, obviously, but also the writer and one of the main voice actors - more on that later. The artstyle is very stylized and a bit silly, but quite lovely, and it fits the theme very well. The gameplay is simple, but satisfying; a somewhat detailed description of which is below.The game stars a filthy, cynical, sadistic dwarf called Grimm (hence the name), who despises the trend of prettying up fairy tales for kids, and makes it his mission to return them back to their dark origins, or at least his own spin on their dark origins. Grimm, along with every other character in the game, is voiced by Roger L. Jackson, whom you may know as the voice of Ghostface (Scream films), Mojo Jojo (the Powerpuff Girls), the Cheshire Cat (McGee's Alice), Anton Sokolov (Dishonored), etc. etc. As such, despite being only one person, the voice acting is varied and top notch, if hammy, and is one of the highlights of the game, along with the well written dialogue and dark sense of humour. The game doesn't take itself very seriously, and it's all the better for that.Grimm is made up of a series of self-contained episodes that take about half an hour to an hour to complete, each one based on a particular fairy tale, some well-known, others not so much. At the beginning and end of each episode you watch a puppet theatre narrated by Grimm, the first one being a cutesy and inoffensive version of the tale that he picks apart, the latter one being his own, nastier, gruesome take on the tale. These, as with all cutscenes, are skippable. Between these two are a series of levels or ""scenes"", based on the events of the tale, and it’s here where the meat of the game lies.Gameplay-wise, the game is a fairly simple platformer but with a special mechanic; in every level Grimm has a circular aura around his person that can instantly change objects from their original sugary cuteness, to excessively dark and grotesque. The living creatures and people of the land (referred to as ""cleaners""), valiantly try to stave off Grimm's corruption by converting objects back to their lighter selves. Their efforts are pretty much in vein, however, as Grimm can convert objects far more quickly than they do, so they function more as a nuisance than a real threat.As Grimm converts more objects, he becomes more powerful, which is represented in-game by his ""Dark-o-Meter"". Gaining levels in the Dark-o-Meter gives Grimm a larger aura, allows him to jump higher and run faster, and most importantly, convert bigger objects and eventually the cleaners themselves, which renders them powerless. To progress through each level, Grimm must convert certain indicated objects to their dark equivalents, which usually requires filling up the Dark-o-Meter to a certain point. There is no fail state, and though Grimm can die through environmental hazards such as water, he respawns immediately and there is no penalty for dying, so playing through the game is a fairly straightforward and relaxed affair, though there are medals available for speedrunning levels, if you're into that sort of thing.Some episodes spice things up by introducing powerups, and some levels are more platforming-heavy than others, but other than that the gameplay is pretty much the same throughout the series. One might think this could get boring fast (and for some it might do), but in my opinion it's kept fresh by the sheer variety of objects that can be converted. Every single character, object, and piece of the environment has a light and dark variant, and each episode has its own original setting which introduces a lot of new ones. Much of the fun comes from seeing how each new cutesy object/character warps into a twisted and disgusting parody of its former self (and if you manage to collect all the ""secrets"" hidden in an episode's levels, you can see the episode's Gallery, which allows you to look closely at light and dark variations of every object from any angle).There's also something viscerally satisfying about the way Grimm converts things; as your power increases you may begin to feel like a perverse demigod as the land curdles all around you, and the fact everyone is powerless to stop you and you cannot be killed just adds to that. It's fun to look back at your handiwork at the end of each level and see how almost unrecognisable the land is from its former self.As for the negatives, the gameplay is, as said, simple, and may be too much so for some people. The game was made quickly and on a budget, and it shows - the animation is often quite stiff and there's a certain lack of polish, but fortunately the artstyle makes this not too much of an issue, and it does improve somewhat as the series goes on. While the voice acting is good, it can get rather repetitive at times, as can the music, although each episode has a different soundtrack which prevents you getting too sick of it. Camera is serviceable but a little restrictive; I would have preferred to be able to look up and around a bit more to see things, as that's the focus of the game, though in the later episodes a new wider camera option is added that helps with that. The fact that it's in episodic format results in some oddities, such as later episodes having slightly more features, and settings (e.g. screen resolution) not being transferred between episodes, so you have to re-set them each time you play a new episode. Finally, there may not be a massive amount of replayability once you've been through each episode, unless you wish to get the timed medals and/or find every secret. None of these negatives have been a major problem for me, though.So, to sum up, if you're only looking for deep, strategic and/or very difficult gameplay, this game probably isn't for you. If you'd enjoy a more laid-back experience that you can dip in and out of, enjoy black humour, and perhaps have a passing interest in fairy tales, you could do a lot worse than Grimm."

The gameplay is simple and laid-back.. nothing is going to attack you (they just clean up behind your mess).  You can only die by falling into chasms, water, or lava (and there is no penalty for death).  It plays like De Blob + a Katamari game.  The real treat is the story-telling.  You begin each tale with a very sarcastic telling of the truthful version.  Upon completion, you get to watch the disturbing retelling you created.  Definately not for everyone, but you get a pretty good bit of content for $10."

A smelly, cynical dwarf who's deceptively immature with his love for purile humor and fart jokes. But he's actually intelligent, using complex words and even speaking Mandarin Chinese in one particular Fairytale.You run around some famous (and some rather obscure) fairytales, your existence itself causing the world to become corrupt and rigid, all in the name of returning the fairytales to their rightful state. There's where one gripe of mine comes in. You don't actually turn things into how they were supposed to be. In the original Little Red Riding Hood, Red Riding Hood actually eats her own mother, that never happens in this game. You rather turn them into dark parodies, which kind of ruins the entire purpose.Nevertheless, turning fairytales into dark, disturbing, and metal as hell wastelands is pretty entertaining. Theres an upwards of thousand of different object transformations to keep it from being stale. It even brings variations on the darkening to keep things especially fresh (Like in King Midas when you turn everything into gold).The animations are very primitive, you can tell this was made on a budget. And the cleaners are the most annoying things you will ever encounter. But buy this game anyway, it's loads of fun for what it's worth. I hope to see a sequel...May all our stories end so well! Until next time!"

Grimm offers a gameplay experience similar to the Katamari games but reversed. Instead of consuming everything it's your job to make everything you see dirty and evil. Walk near a building and it will transform into something ugly. Fill up your meter to change even the biggest objects because you can't just change anything you see when you start a level, you have to build it up.Each level lasts several minutes and each episode consists of about 5 levels. Way too many. It's all related to children's storybooks, though. Which is unique, I'll give it that. And the graphics have a cartoony, charming look. It's the thing I was most impressed by actually.But I wasn't impressed by this game back then and I'm still not impressed (if you couldn't tell). Avoid.[Rating: 61/100]"
,Recommended,252150,8612083,"Posted: 7 January, 2014",all,Captain Shenanigans,"American McGee's Grimm is certainly no Alice or Return to Madness - but it's not trying to be either. It's different. I think that's the best way to put it, it's just different and that difference makes it refreshing. I'm not saying it's the game to end all games but it's something that's worth a look at if you enjoy dark, morbid humor. The art style presented in this game works for what it's trying to do. Something about the bright, oddly shaped characters is actually really appealing and, personally, I never get tired of seeing what kind of macabre stuff things turn into. A cute little deer running around? Nope, now it's cut in half and flailing around helplessly - it's really freakin' creepy and yet still brought a smile to my face. Each story (which there are 23 of) has 5 to 6 scenes to play out and there are a couple of collectibles hidden around the areas: collecting all 10 for a story unlocks the art gallery. You can also get a medal for turning everything dark 100% but beyond that there's not much to do. The game mechanic of going around and turning everything into a dark version of itself can and probably will get tedious to some, there are no enemies to fight and very little threat to Grimm besides water/lava and the Cleaners that come around to clean up your darkness, which aren't so much a threat as they are an annoyance but you can stun them for a couple of seconds. It does have some movement flaws and glitches where I found myself stuck on a tree and unable to jump or running in to an invisible wall after doing a Buttstomp and I have to say Grimm repeats his lines way too much, but besides that it's a pretty sturdy game. Certainly not going to be for everyone and you can probably feel like you're getting a better deal for it if it goes on sale, but if you're interested in seeing your favorite childrens' story turn in to a horrific nightmare  then I think American McGee and Spicy Horse did a fantastic job in delivering."
,Recommended,252150,13040854,"Posted: 22 November, 2014",all,Muir,"Brief Synopsis:Grimm is an episodic game that takes you through versions of different Fairy Tales. In this game, you play as Grimm, a gross little imp-like man who wants to turn all Fairy Tales back to their gruesome originals. To do this, you simply walk through each scene, dirtying up everything around you. Your main weapon is ""butt-stomping"", which dirties up larger areas than simply walking. There are also special power ups such as ""Flaming Pee"" and ""Sausage Stomp"", just to name two.Long Review:Story- There are over 20 different episodes in the game. Each one depicts a different Fairy Tale. Most you'll recognise, but there are a few obscure ones that you may or may not have heard of. Each episode starts off by showing the ""light"" version of the Fairy Tale, where Grimm points out all of its flaws. After you've finished dirtying up everything, the ""dark"" version plays.Graphics- The graphics are cartoony and several assets (random people, princesses, and such) are reused from one story to another. The best part about the graphics are how they change from ""cutesy"" to ""grimm"".Music/Sounds- The sound fx are pretty good in this game and the music (especially the music that plays when the game is on pause) is very catchy. I've actually caught myself humming it when out doing shopping.Length- Each episode lasts over an hour, if you watch both the light and dark cinematics. They can be skipped by pressing the SPACE button however. If you skip them, and play quickly through the episode, then each one will last roughly 30-40 minutes.Replayability- There are lots of ""secrets"" (coins) which can be found in each episode as well as the potiential to earn gold stars for turning everything in each scene dark, so there is a bit of replayability in this game if you don't manage to do everything the first time through.Overall, if you're the type of person who enjoys immature humour (fart jokes) and cartoony depictions of violence, and you like games which don't really take themselves very seriously, you would probably enjoy this game. It does have a few problems with camera angles which are quite annoying in places, so you may want to wait until the game goes on sale to get it."

Each episode is maybe around half an hour or so if you are a perfectionist like myself and need to turn every inch of the map dirty, if you aren't you can probably complete each episode in about 15 minutes. But if you love quirky dark folklore with an even more gruesome twist you'll probably want to give this a shot. I personally loved it's style, watching all the things in the game turn into their dark forms, and the twisted humor. Keep in mind the season's together are overall cheaper in their packs instead of buying all the DLC separately. (Hey devs, make hansel and gretel, though, yea? :D )"

This does not skimp on the gorn, the nausea fuel, *or* the karmic retribution at times. The stylized graphics, born about a decade or so ago, do still have adequate punch even today.The gameplay is a touch sticky at times, with the ""cleaners"" occasionally slipping under your radar until you can sweep 'em up, but more often than not you won't want for momentum. The only other aspect, platforming, *can* be much more sticky. Precision platforming takes some getting used to thanks to Grimm having a bit of an awkward momentum system as well as wind mechanics at times, but otherwise it's tolerable.The storylines, however, are where this game shines. Without a doubt, I have enjoyed each and every one of the stories I've dug into. Even as he twists the fairy tales into horrid mockeries of their former selves, Grimm never seems absolutely deplorable. He even shows that he believes in proper retribution, if absolutely over-the-top and borne of a twisted world, and this makes him seem like he just wants the fairy tales to represent real life a little more. All the same, the darkened endings you'll find yourself viewing are always good for a laugh. Seeing these stories turn into profanity-laden, blood-and-pus filled nightmare-scapes just seems fun when black comedy is laced so thoroughly throughout.Bottom line, tl;dr...Graphics: 7/10Sound: 8/10 (10/10 for the Muzak rendition of the title theme added in later episodes)Plot: 10/10.

You play as the evil dwarf named Grimm, and his mission is to change cute and happy fairy tales into dark and twisted stories. The gameplay is very simple, running, jumping and occasionally butt stomping. The goal is to turn everything around you into a dark wasteland in order to progress with altering tales such as Little Red Riding Hood, A Christmas Carol, Pinnochio, Cinderella, Jack and the Banstalk, and many other tales. Each episode opens up with a cutscene to showcase the stories Light Theater with it's cute and cuddly characters, after completing each mission of an episode, you'll be able to watch the Dark Theater mode to see Grimm's version of the tale. Some episodes include power ups such as high jump, super butt stomp, flaming pee, and others. Each episode has a collection of Secret Tokens, collecting them al will unlock the Gallery and view both the light and dark versions of props and sets of each episode, too bad it doesn't show the character models. The only issue I had with this game is being stuck inbetween obsticales which can be annoying, there's only been a few times I had to leave the chapter and come back to it and not get stuck. The first episode if free to play to give people an idea on how the game is like, while the other episodes cost about 1 dollar each, as there are 23 Episodes total. This is more of a different game than most of Mcgee's titles, as this relies more on the artstyle and whitty dialouge with Grimm and the fairy tale creatures. It's also amazing that Roger L. Jackson voices every frikkin character in this game, even in the Mulan episode where he speaks in chinese gibbirish. The last event in the last episode, Snow White, is an epic and fitting end to the series. So if your in the mood for some more mature versions of classic fairy tales with it's simple gameplay, hilarous writting, and interesting art style, this game is worth a play for one of those slow days when you have nothing better to do. May all our stories end so well. Until next time."
,Recommended,252150,8847730,"Posted: 25 January, 2014",all,Toadflax,"This game is fun. It's also dark, and some people of a certain religious or moral persuasion really won't like it. There's a reason for the darkness and moral ambiguity, though, which I'll expand on later.You play a character named Grimm, whose mission is to restore the 21st century versions of fairy tales to their original medieval purpose. This involves removing as much pink and shiny “niceness” as possible, and replacing it with darkness and corruption. That said, the whole thing is handled in a fairly humorous manner.The graphics are not spectacular, and the game play is not demanding. It is, however, very funny, and I'm enjoying it a lot.If I have a gripe, it's that the game doesn't even attempt to address the censorship of the sexual content of the old fairy stories. On the one hand, given the current moral panic over the effects of computer games, I can understand. But on the other hand, isn't it just that censorship that the game seeks to address?Anyway, it's an enjoyable game, and very thought provoking.I apologise for this next section. It started as a review, but became an essay. I'm concerned that some people who have written about this game don't understand the history or purpose behind it.The stories we now know as “fairy tales” were largely based on folk tales current in 16th and 17th century Europe. The stories, however, are in many cases much older. They captured people's imagination, and were passed down orally from generation to generation, because they performed a valuable teaching function. They warned people of the dangers out there. They were not originally intended for children, and many of them explore extremely violent, sexual and disturbing themes.For instance, the oldest known version of “Sleeping Beauty” is “Sole, Luna, e Talia” recorded by Giambattista Basile, published in 1634. In this story, the handsome prince does not kiss Beauty to wake her. Instead, he rapes her while she's unconscious, and then departs, apparently without a thought. Leaving her still comatose, but now also pregnant with twins.In the original version of “Red Riding Hood”, there's no granny, no cottage, and no huntsman. There's just a little girl, alone in the forest, and a wolf. And it kills her, and eats her. She doesn't get rescued, there's no happy ending, she's dead.19th century writers such as the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen recounted many of these stories. But, in keeping with the moral code of their time, completely removed the sexual references, and greatly toned down the violence. Even so, this sanitisation was nowhere near enough for 20th century moralists. Disney is an easy target here, but Disney are far from alone in further Bowdlerising the stories to the point where they're fluffy, happy, and completely inoffensive. The problem is that the modern versions of these stories are also totally meaningless, and devoid of any of the original teaching. “And they all lived happily ever after” is a modern lie. It's not true now, and in 1600 no-one would have been stupid enough to say it.That's what American McGee is getting at here – these stories were originally extremely nasty, but deliberately so. They were intended to teach lessons about a violent, dangerous and untrustworthy world. In censoring them to suit modern sensibilities, they have been completely stripped of their original power and purpose."

He enjoyed it and I enjoyed watching him play it.  In fact I had to butt in and play a few times myself because it looked so fun.  We finished episode 1 and we both wanted to play more so I immediately purchased the full first season.  There is some repitition as far as gameplay is concerned but the entertainment of being able to take a ""disneyfied"" version of a story and see what you can do to twist it into a darker and more gritty tale outweighs the repetitive nature of the gameplay. I am planning on purchasing the second and third seasons as well (just need to wait til I have the extra scratch).  It's worth it for less than $12.  The only real gripe I have is that you have to set the resolution for each episode individualy instead of all at once.  Each time I launched an episode for the first time it was set to the default 1024x768 which is terrible."

Or how about how much it stinks and everything about it is so dirty. Well, surprisngly, the game does stink and is quite dirty, but that's only b/c that's what the game is about. You play as Grimm, a stinky and evil little man whose goal is to turn everything around him to utter darkness and give off the worst odor imaginable. I'm pretty sure it's based off of the Grimm Fairy Tales, not too sure about this. Only looked up a little bit of information the night before.It is an episodic based game. In total there's, IIRC, 23 episodes... Each with about 4-6 levels. The first episode is free on Steam, but you can buy the episodes in bundles of seasons; Season 1, 2, & 3. They are fairly cheap, which just makes them worth it if you have the extra money.It's not what you'd expect from a game, but the execution of everthing this game has to offer to me was just awesome and enjoyable.

,Recommended,252150,20600613,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,R34LM,"I found this game to be very enjoyable.The basic premise is that you play as a disgutsing littly dude named Grimm who wishes to take away all the neat and tidy and childish out of commonly known fairy tales and replace them with filth, gore and dark undertones.The game itself was released in an episodic fashion when it was brand new, coming out every week, but now all three seasons are here.Each episode and gameplay plays out the same. You begin with Grimm telling you the cutesy version of the fairy tale in the episode (ranging from Father Death, Frog Prince and Snow White as a series finale). When that story is finished, you enter each scene as Grimm and begin spreading filth. Grimm has an aura/radius of darkness that turns the light hearted terrain and objects into darkness. Starting off, you can only convert buckets and flowers, but as you convert more you gain more points towards your darkness level (shown at the top of the screen). Higher levels of darkness means a wider aura, faster speed, higher jumping, and, most importantly, the ability to convert larger objects. During the conversion, fairy tale characters and creatures will attempt to clean up the mess, but they don't prove to be much of an issue.The usual goal in each scene is getting to a certain level of darkness and then ""butt-stomping' (jump twice) the plot point to proceed. Once all scenes have been converted, the story is then retold in its raw and dark way and the episode is over.The art style fits the theme of the game, with really childish creatures that turn into ugly monstrosities. It's just enjoyable to see what one fairy tale object will convert to, such as a regular tree turning into a tree filled with hanging corpses.The humor within this game ranges from fart jokes to satire to black humor, all of which makes the game much mor enjoyable. Grimm himself is an enjoyable narrator and character. Fun fact: the voice actor for Grimm voices EVERY character in the game, which shows off the guy's incredible voice talent.The one downside is that once you play one episode you basically have played them all. The gameplay is the same through each episode, though some introduce other gameplay elements.To defend that point, however, the game is built around the narration of the story and the curiosity of how each story (and every object in it) will look after Grimm has converted it. So, even though the gameplay is the same, it is a different story to muck up. The choices in fairy tales are great, too.If you don't mind the repetitive gameplay, definitely give this game a go. Sometimes it is good to pass 30 minutes of time by playing an episode, and you got three series of episodes to play, which will keep you occupied."

76561198078010274,Recommended,252150,29773798,Posted: 7 February,all,HotelKatz,"Grimm is a 3d platformer that revisits fairy tales. First in the modern watered down state, then has you change them back to a state that resembled the tales written hundren of years eariler. As in back when they were darker, crueler, and.... dare I say... grimmer? True, it still takes pot shots at the stories and cracks jokes every so often, even during the latter state.But part of the charm is in the humor, even if it does get a little bit crass, rude, and vulgar. For crying out loud, the targeting reticle is Grimm urinating at the spot where he would jump at.Each chapter is about a dollar or so. There's coins of Grimm found in the stages. Collect all in a chapter (which is a few stages) and you'll unlock a model viewer. The model viewer has only buildings and breakable things to look at, but it does allow you to see the change between the stuff's Sugary-sweet version and the grim version. The difficulty of collecting the coins isn't that hard, just look aroudn the stage. I didn have a little bit of a problem looking for one coin in the final stage, but it turned out to be on top of a building.The music does fit the setting, both when in the light version and dark version. I'll admit, the music is simple, short and repeats, but it's not going to ruin anything. The grimm-ified singing skull does have a ear worm-worth song in my mind, though.I had some difficulty at first, getting used to a keyboard and mouse controls, back when I first played this. Precision jumping is a little difficult to get used to and a tad trying during the 'Run!' moments. but given time and patience, you can get used to it.Is this worth buying? It's a nice jaunt through stories we've all read, listened to, and watched for dozons of times when either we were younger, or were looking after a child. And let's face it, we've all made those rude nasty jokes about fairy tales at one point or another. I say at least try the first stage. It's free, after all.Fun fact : The little icon for Jack and the Bean Stalk in the 'choose a story' menu uses an earlier version of the Grimm-ified Jack. The little icon has a straw hat, but the grimm-ified version is designed to look more like a punk or something."
