,Not Recommended,252170,13763235,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,Bob the Builder,"Firstly, I would like to mention that I personally enjoy the Anomaly Series and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign is a Tower Offense game, instead of the traditional Tower Defence games. This makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games.With that said, the original intention of creating Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign is to be played on mobile devices, rather than on a PC. As this is a game meant for mobile devices, it is pretty much the same as the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth, just that you would realise that there are no keyboard shortcuts, making it unfriendly for PC gaming.For PC gaming, my recommendation would be to get Anomaly: Warzone Earth, instead of Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign as I find the PC version more enjoyable and with keyboard shortcuts, making the overall gameplay more convenient rather than having to use the mouse all the time."
,Not Recommended,252170,14072330,"Posted: 19 January, 2015",all,unknown,There is absolutely no reason to play this game on PC if you have played the original Anomaly. Mobile games usually not suited for mouse+keyboard and this one is no exception.

76561197969417125,Recommended,252170,19022698,"Posted: 11 November, 2015",all,G00N3R,"Anomaly Mobile Campaign is, as the name suggests, an additional campaign for Anomaly Warzone Earth, primarily designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC.Gameplay is the same tower offence style where you buy tanks, APCs etc and select the route they will use to travel around the map while destroying or avoiding the alien towers. The biggest difference is you don't have the commander unit running around, but you can still deploy powers like repair and air strike by just clicking where you want to use them.The campaign is quite short at 2.5 hours, there is an extra wave based mode but except for the lack of commander, its identical to the same mode in the original game. I didn't encounter any bugs, but there's a lack of keyboard short cuts compared to the original, clearly influenced by the mobile control scheme.Overall its worth playing if a) you enjoyed the original game and b) you pick it up on sale - I recently bought it for 90% off which seems like a fair price."

,Recommended,252170,19812215,"Posted: 20 December, 2015",all,✪ JS3,This game is sort of like a reverse tower defense game. you choose your route and units and try to complete objectives and  escape using your units and different ability's that can be picked up. Those powerups also stack so it places an emphisis on not wasting them. Overall a great  game with an innovative concept.
,Recommended,252170,23040882,"Posted: 17 May, 2016",all,jack_the_beast,"this is just the pc port of the mobile port of the pc game, so if you played the original pc version already you won't find any new content, you'll only get a mobile-oriented interface (I'm not even sure if it's compatible with touch-screen computers)it still is a great game tought"

It does not play like additional levels, and you have to repeat training on the squad units, abilities, etc.  Not worth the money, even at $5."
