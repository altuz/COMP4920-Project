,Not Recommended,252230,29596662,Posted: 30 January,all,Hurdles McRankles,You start fighting the main boss right at the beginning of the game and you fight him the whole game.  The main boss is the camera which is garbage your view is constantly awkward and off.  The last time I was beaten this bad by a camera I was drunk in a back alley in New Orleans refusing to give up my wallet and Nikon.

76561197983662248,Recommended,252230,9765635,"Posted: 8 April, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Gameplay: I really don't get the hate surrounding this game. Yeah, sure, it's not the same quality of game as the Itagaki-produced games, but it's still a load of fun. The gameplay is best described (in my opinion) as a cross between Devil May Cry and Rise of the Triad (actually, that's fair to say in more respects than just the gameplay). Rather than going with light attack/heavy attack/grab, the game has three different types of attack: shortsword for fast face fu- I mean wrecking; fists for punching things dead hard; and flails, which are essentially the Blades of Olympus. Along with that are some special weapons that you get from executing stronger enemies. These lead into the Element system of the game, which is really vital to grasp so that you don't launch your controller, chair, monitor, PC, and desk out the window. However, even more essential is learning how to counter.Admittedly, countering is somewhat finicky, but I found it to be a godsend against the later bosses of the game. My biggest complaints, honestly, are the finicky countering and the camera, which can be a huge pain at times.  However, those didn't really ruin my day all that much. After beating the game, you unlock Ninja Gaiden Z mode, which is essentially a ""Yaiba-lite"" version that plays more like a beat-em-up game like Streets of Rage than an actual classic Ninja Gaiden game. This was disappointing, admittedly, but it's still a good bit of fun. Also, no, I haven't beaten it. I'm not good enough to do about an hours worth of gameplay on one continue. But hey, this review isn't about my gaming abilities; it's about the game, and this game is simply fun. While it's not as engaging as Ninja Gaiden Black, I still think this game is a load of fun and will definitely play through it again on higher difficulties in the future. 8/10.Story: The Ninja Gaiden series has never been well known for being the most well-written, and I think it's about time that they embrace their incredibly camp nature. Spark Entertainment felt the same way, too. The writing most definitely got plenty of laughs out of the 12 year old inside me. The Engrish in the Arcade mode was pretty great, too, even if it is a bit of an easy joke. Unlike gameplay, there really isn't much here to talk about. If you've got an immature sense of humor, you'll probably enjoy the cutscenes and dialogue. Just don't go into it expecting Shakespeare. 7/10.Graphics: Definitely the most striking aspect of this game. It's got that ultra-cel shaded style in the ilk of games like Madworld, Killer7, and No More Heroes, and it looks pretty dang good when you crank the settings to max. It ran near-perfectly on my GTX 760 at 1080p, max settings, and 60FPS, so if you've got a similar card, you should have pretty similar results. As for the actual art design of the game itself, some of the areas get a bit boring to look at again and again, but if you're spending that much time looking at the scenery, you're not playing the game right. Now, don't think I made those comparisons earlier in this section without intent. This game, much like the prior three mentioned, is pretty dang violent. Absurdly so. However, this helps feed into the campy nature of this game, so I don't mind it at all. Again, this is more proof that art style trumps ultra-high polygon counts most any day of the week. Your eyes will most definitely not get bored, presuming you're actually playing the game. 5/5.Audio: This game has a pretty rad soundtrack, I must say.  The ""hard encounter"" theme is a bit meh, but there is some pretty good battle music throughout this game. They're songs you probably wouldn't mind working out to, if that helps give you an idea of the kinds of songs in the game. As for the voice acting, it doesn't get in the way. Nothing really that remarkable. Sound design, once again, doesn't really get in the way or make itself known all that much. For some pretty good songs, but not too remarkable anything else, the audio portion of this game gets a 3/5.Overall: An absolutely gaudy adventure both in style and in substance that I overall had a pretty good time with. However, I'd hold off until this game becomes about $30 or so. Any higher is a bit too much in my opinion. 8/7/5/3; 7.7/10."

It's a decent hack and slash with a great comic feel, and it's just awesome to pull off combo after combo on huge waves of zombies, but the story and everything is plain dreadful. It's dumb, crazy, got a stupid plot and all, but it does ensue for heaps of fun and mayhem if you pick this game up really cheap. It's not for you if you're looking for a proper Ninja Gaiden game, but it's certainly for you if you're in to the hack and slash genre, like badass cyborg ninjas, zombies, explosions, blood, gore and choppas! It is such a dumb game, but it's action packed and full of humor and you will get to pick up missiles in mid air and throw them at helicopters. The camera is bad, story is bad, dialogue is bad, characters are bad, AI is dumb, but the gameplay is regretfully fun. Once you complete this game, it will get you thinking what the hell you're doing with your life. 5/10"

,Recommended,252230,9610700,"Posted: 23 March, 2014",all,Tizoc,First off don't go into this expecting a Ninja Gaiden game.From what I've played it's combat reminds me of the Dynasty Warriors/Musou genre. While graphically it's colorful and nice. The gameplay won't appeal to those looking for depth in their combat systems.If you just want a simple hack n' slash game where you slaughter hordes of zombies you may like this game.The platforming segments aren't all that hard but were really unneeded.
,Recommended,252230,9600843,"Posted: 22 March, 2014",all,M.D. Chaos,"If you can accept the new direction of ninja gaiden, there is a really fun hack n slash with a great b-movie vibe with a colorful new look and feel to a hack n slash.The story is about a foul mouthed ninja named Yaiba kamikaze who gets killed by series protagonist,Ryu Hayabusa. several weeks later, Yaiba is rebuilt by a corporation so that he can ""stop"" the zombie outbreak(yes you fight zombies, but I'll get to that later) and Get his Revenge on Ryu Hayabusa. The story is pretty basic and predictable, it ends up being really abrupt near the end.The writing is something you ethier are gonna love or hate, personally I see the majority of the dialogue to be so bad it's good, and the humor comes from how vulgur the characters are with lines like ""He's got some hot woman helping him. I'm sooo jealous. Maybe I'll kill her when I see her. Or maybe we can make out. Maybe we'll have a threesome! I'll do whatever Yaiba tells me to do. I'm so horny..."". There are some geniunely funny moments like the introductions of the zombies, which is just slap stick humor at best.The gameplay of yaiba isn't ninja gaiden, it's more like Devil may cry,rygar, or Lords of shadows. The actual combat consists of 3 weapons which are a flail(basically a chain),Cyborg arm, and your ninja sword. It takes some time for the combat to become really entertaining, when you know how the system works. You can also do executions which will you give you more health(especially usefull when upgrading to do up to 10 executions) and a counter system which when you pull it off is incredibly satisfying though it isn't that well implented as lords of shadows. You can also pick up weapons from enemies by executing them(or a mashing qte) ranging from numbchucks to electro whips to a rocket launcher, which make the combat more interesting because each enemy has their own weakness to certain elements . there is also platforming, which is on rails and quite fun for the most part.Now the one thing that most reviewers criticize the game is the difficulty, which the game really isn't that hard if you get all the collectibles. Which there are 2 types, the first one being health shards(which combing 4 of them will increase your health),story parts and elemental resistent shards(which makes the game a hell of a lot easier to get through). I HIGHLY Reccomend you get all of them since they will make the game a lot more easier than the reviews are saying are saying it is.Here is a video of where you can find them.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMVQiJCw2FkNow there are 2 flaws with this game, the first is that the game is rather short it took me around 6 hours to finish the main campaign and honestly it could have included a few more levels to make it around 8-10 hours long which would have been the perfect length for this game. The next one is the camera, which is fixed and you can't control it, however it is a improvement over the console version, which apparently is worse.Overall the gameplay is fast paced,franic, and just good mindless fun.The visuals are pretty solid, they are done in a cel shaded look which gives the game a comic book look to it, and I ike the designs of the zombies(and yaiba As well), since all of them are Unique, and all look drastically different. Animations are very fluent and fun to look at. The PC version also runs at 60 fps, which helps with your reaction time in the game.Sound is pretty good, the soundtrack fits the mood of the game and has some killer tracks in there . sound effects are great especially the attack sounds when you hear the crunching sounds of zombies being ripped to shreads. Voice acting is alright, nothing really stand out and half the time I barely noticed it, but what is there is just fine.In short, Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z is an enjoyable hack n slash, with a nice look and feel that you don't get from the typical hack n slash. I would reccomend the game when it's on sale, since asking for full price is too much for what is there.8/10 Good brainless B-movie fun."

The somewhat quirky plot just adds to the appeal of the insane- over the top hack and slash gameplay. One aspect of this game that might turn off die hard Ninja Gaiden fans is that you dont play as Ryu Hayabusa- you play as Yaiba Kamikaze a rouge ninja from Ryu's clan who refused to return an ancient blade to Ryu. In turn, Yaiba die's and is now a cyborg in the zombie apocolyptic future and begins a new journey to get revenge on Ryu Hayabusa. This game is insane amount's of fun, but there are some part's that will test your patience, like running into an overpowered enemy, or one that has too much health, or you can't find a hidden health upgrade- So I believe that this game still has the good old hair tearing difficulty in some sections. The comic book-like art style work's perfectly and only work's to compliment the gameplay seen here (It almost excuses this games horrible camera). You also can get really interesting power-ups that makes an exciting expirence just THAT much more interesting! The gameplay is the absolute best part too- There is no feeling like the feeling you get from mowing down hordes of enemies in your psychotic rampage. A psychotic rampage unlike any other- that THIS game provides! I thoroughly enjoy this game and strongly reccomend buying it if you have not already. Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z get's a 9/10!"

Even the execution kills don't feel satisfying which might partially be due to the comic look.In this case I was actually happy that the game is only about 4-5 hours short, so I wouldn't have to sit through more boring combat segments, frustrating parkour areas and badly placed checkpoints.Now that games like Bayonetta and Devil May Cry are out on Steam, there is absolutely no reason to play Yaiba since it falls short in all aspects compared to it's rivals."
76561198103416483,Recommended,252230,18336645,"Posted: 4 October, 2015",all,Foxmikage,"I'm a fan of both Ninja Gaiden and Dead Rising, so I had to pre order this when I heard Inafune was making a NG game (also to test out my gaming PC, mostly play strategy and other less resource intensive games on PC).Overall Yaiba is an average fun game. The gameplay has a rock/paper/sissors puzzle aspect in using different types of attacks and types of zombies to counter different types of enemies, and you can harvest special weapons from mini boss type zombies. It has an experience based upgrading system similar to NG3:Razor's Edge, and I love humor, the kind I expect from a Keiji Inafune zombie game. The story is a 180 reversal on Ninja Gaiden, with Ryu Hayabusa, the hero of the series being the main enemy. Instead you're Yaiba Kamikaze, who is the ultimate zombie apocalyse Psychopath Frank West, Chunk Greene and Nick Ramos would NEVER want to encounter, even if it was 3 of them armed to the teeth with combo weapons & vehicles against Yaiba.But it is still not the Ninja Gaiden/Dead Rising style mash up I hyped myself up for. Compared to Ninja Gaiden it doesn't have the smooth and satisfying ninja feel, instead feeling rather clunky controlling Yaiba; nor does it feel as fun killing Zombies as it does in Dead Rising games, fighting the same types of zombies over and over gets old without over the top psychopath-like enemies to freshen it up in between. The game length is short and starts feeling rushed halfway through. I'd still recommend it to any fan of Ninja Gaiden or Dead Rising, just don't expect Ninja Gaiden or Dead Rising quality, but rather a very very very very very rushed underbudgeted version of those games. It's almost like a Case Zero version of Ninja Gaiden; good enough to be a small DLC game, but not good enough to be a main game. I hope they make a sequel, because this feels like a huge missed opportunity mashing ninjas and zombies together. I expect way more over the top action and gorey zombie parts flying everywhere constantly when Ryu Hayabusa and Yaiba Kamikaze fight their epic ninja battles with zombies caught in the crossfire."

,Recommended,252230,11456623,"Posted: 28 July, 2014",all,Captain Animerica,"Since it's been awhile that I've done a written review, I plan to pull out my biggest gavel on this one. First off, after trying it out for about two hours and clearing two stages (for a future LP), it puts me in the mind of the Koei Warriors series since it literally plays in that style.  Another thing that I have to say is, why so much hate toward this game to begin with? You don't like it because it doesn't meet YOUR expectations? Let others enjoy it for what its worth but don't let a ""professional"" review tell you otherwise. Seeing that Inafune's company played a part in this made me just play this game even more.  (Course that's a personal reason for me but moving on...) The fact that it feels like an uber-gory graphic novel piqued my interest when I started up the game and I couldn't put it down since.  My advice is that you'd have to think out the box on this game, this game is crazy good and if you enjoy a mind-numbing hack and slash with very little story and lots of action, then go for it and buy it for yourself and I highly recommend getting it for a friend if you so choose.  I feel a game like this gets a lot of unneeded flak just because it doesn't meet a certain level of expectation so on that note, it counts as an underrated game. Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z is approved in my book and should be worth trying in yours."

Between areas the story is filled in by brief dialog with other characters over a communications system; it reminds me of early video games back before unnecessary cut scenes were put into games. The story isn't terribly deep but I didn't mind, it's cheap fun. I played through on easy difficulty because I'm trying to cut through my backlog, it was easy but I actually enjoyed it. I guess it took me around 7 hours to complete, but I'm not really sure I completed it...The bad:It can be buggy. I'm pretty sure I beat the final boss, but it would crash probably before the final cut scene or whatever was supposed to be shown. I had modified the config to allow higher frame rates and disable intro videos, but I allowed that to be reverted, I checked game cache, and rebooted and the issue persisted. Other than that, if you do run it over 60FPS, there may be some areas you'll get stuck but the game saves so often that you should be able to exit, revert the changes you made to the INI file and continue. In the tutorial (beginning), it stopped letting me block/counter, not sure if that was a side effect of the frame rate mod, but others in the forums have experienced similar issues; fortunately it was early in so I just restarted the game.If you want it, buy it cheap (less than $10). I didn't have too many issues with it, guess I'll go watch the ending on YouTube."

Fight hordes of zombies and other enemies in glorious, flashy fast paced slashing action.Graphically it isn't the best and there aren't many variations when it comes to gameplay. You go from point A to point B and brutally murder everything in your path while purchasing some upgrades for Yaiba a long the way. What really makes the game shine is the humour. Think Borderlands meets Ninja Gaiden. Yaiba is a reckless, ruthless and funny rage filled character that will keep you entertained.I got this on the sale and it's more than worth that price for a couple of hours of switching your brain off to engage in some gory action.The game runs incredibly smooth, I've not encountered any FPS drops, any crashes, any freezes or any graphical issues. I've also not encountered any gameplay bugs so far either. For a fast paced combat focused game running smooth and being as bug free as possible is a must and this game seems to nail it.I will say though if you're a hardcore Ninja Gaiden fan (1, black, 2, 3) then this game likely isn't for you. It has nowhere near that level of difficulty and combat depth and certainly isn't as ""serious"" as the main franchise games try to be in tone.If you're looking for any deep sort of gameplay then I'd move on but if you're just looking to murder hordes of the undead, give it a go.

I dig the cyber ninja thing and the 2.5 D visual style but not the zombies. Plot is not amusing and the cliched jokes aren't funny at all. The combat system is actually pretty decent but its relatively standard gameplay does little to set it apart from its competitors. Most of the puzzles involves chucking a zombie at something to solve them. The game doesn't offer much. Levels are very less(7 only) but has long fights. Long load screens and what's worse of it all is the camera. It pisses me of so much when I can't see my charatcer because it doesn't center on Yaiba and it pans and zooms in and out every time. The AI however is smart and enemies work together to kill you. Not much variety of skills (some of them include upgrading the previous skill) The last boss fight was a huge letdown. The only good thing about this game is having Ryu Hayabusa.Overall, it's boring, repetitive and very sloppy."

The attitude of the character and the awesome stylized game graphics just make this game pop. I love dismembering my opponents and beating down their comrades with those limbs. Especiall the clown zombie limbs. Just frickin amusing to beat someone down with rainbows. Also the counter system which allows you to throw projectiles back at the sender or into a group of enemies is just amazing Then you go the grab system which just lets you use an out right enemy as a bludgening weapon.The thing I enjoy the most is the fact that they took into account what happened to the character and how electicity and such would effect him. Even the cute reminder that hes not fully robotic warnings to stay out of fire and such/ It just all makes me just immerse myself and become addicted for a long time.  As have not beat the game yet I bet even after beaating it I will be returning just to do it again and enjoy the mayhem.

However, I'm glad I bought it.  The gameplay is solid.  I like the progression system and the combos feel good.  It doesn't have 3000 combos, but it has enough where you will pick a few of your favorites and then learn a couple more to add some diversity when fighting foes.The game is really well balanced if played logically.You have to strategize when to execute enemies to keep your health up and to acquire limited use but devestating weapons.  Which brings me to an important point.  There is a lot of strategy involved in this game.  I don't think most reviewers who were wanting it to play exactly like Ninja Gaiden Black got this important point.  The player has to carefully plan how to approach the easier battles to be prepared for the larger battles involving many tough enemies on the screen at once, or some really tough bosses and mini-bosses.For example, I had my rage meter maxed out and executed the fire bomb guys to make sure I got some health and picked up the bomb weapon because I knew I would fight the mech dog, which is extremely hard to beat just using my standard attack arsenal.  However, with the 100% plus rage perk, and the bomb launcher equiped, I made short work of this otherwise impossible foe in 10 seconds.  This is becuase I got my a$$ handed to me the first two times around and realized I needed to use some common sense and logic and smart battle preperation to win the fight.  It really is a great system which is rewarding when used correctly.My two gripes are the game takes a really long time to load when you die, which means I found myself giving up and walking away a few times because I got tired of running to a tough enemy, dying after 10 seconds, then waiting a minute for the game to load, only to die 10 seconds later.  The second gripe I have are the numerous bugs that will make you want to punch your monitor.  But really, aside of the long load time when you die and some really stupid bugs, the game is great, especially for $30."

IMHO i think the people that played the game did not take the time to learn all the various combos and most importantly the elements system. In other words all those reviewers just plain suck at games and shouldn't call themselves gamers. They look at the few bad things and blow it out of proportion. And yes I said they are not ""Gamers.""I do agree that there are some aspects of the game that can be mind-wracking, but its not as bad as you may believe. Such as the camera...Yes the camera can become an issue at some times, but all you need to do is dash out of the fray and get back to slaughtering zombies. Other reviewers complain about how some zombies are impossible to kill with out ""Zombie Weapons,"" but that a bunch of bull...default weapons are just as viable.With that said about default weapons, counterattacking the zombies is easy with the convenient circle indicators above their heads; just need to time your button presses right - you'll see what I mean if you buy the game.You cannot play this game thinking it will be a true to heart/spirit/whatever...Ninja Gaiden game. It is a hack-n-slash to its core - with some SMALL RPG elements via the leveling up system and perks. Jumping around is by simple three-button quicktime events that have checkpoints in between - so don't worry about dieing during the event and having to restart the entire level. And for those combo junkies that do their best to rack up huge combos...well this is your game IMHO - just avoid getting hit. As mentioned earlier about the camera, if you get surrounded by zombies, just dash out - it works rather niceley.Now for the animation, I love it! Not too many games these days have orginal art and animation - especially since everything these days is a got dang FPS. The whole comic book style - though not original - but what is original these days - it is still nice to see and in this case its done rather well IMHO. Animations overall are fluid - havn't experienced any stuttering or issues so far.If gratuitous use of adult language and sexual themes offends you...then this is not your bowl of pudding....go get something a little sweeter. Yaiba and his motley crew have a bunch of sailor mouths, but I'm fine with that.On my last note - the zombie comedy and easter eggs are pretty neat and original.Overall, this is a recommend - Highly recommend if I could. Like any hack-n-slash, take time to learn the combos and other systems implemented. Learn your enemies' movement and patterns to know when to strike, defend, and counter. If you take time to learn, I promise the gaming experience will be much better than trying to bash your way mindlessly to death and eventuall victory.....And for those that didn't buy the game cause the price was ""too high"" you're missing out on the FUN!"

It's a bad game, even worse, it's a♥♥♥♥♥♥Ninja Gaiden game.Of course I was excited when I found out a Ninja Gaiden game was coming to PC. Of course this excitement didn't last as I pretty much instantly found out this was not going to be a true Ninja Gaiden title. So here are my first impressions after playing first two missions:- The game is fast, but not as fast as classic Ninja Gaiden games.- I'm playing on Normal, and the game manages to pose a challenge sometimes. Basic enemies which attack in hordes are very easy. This is one of the things that make this Ninja Gaiden look more like a God of War title.- No free jumping this time around. The jump button is used for dashing. Blocking and countering are still there.- A lot of finishing/execution cut-scenes. Again, this is where the game is obviously treading into God of War territory.- Different weapons are there, but you have to pick them from enemies, and they don't last long. A strange change but I guess it works.- The story is cheesy in a good kind of way. Had a few smirks and grins out of it so far.- The game looks beautiful, feels like you're watching a cartoon.Overall, I'm enjoying the game so far. I'd be happy to play classic NG games instead, or Bayonetta, or DMC. But I'd pick Yaiba over God of War any day of the week.I would urge you to buy the game so we can get more Team Ninja games on PC, but I have little hope for that. This game is made in UE3, which makes it easy to port unlike other Team Ninja titles. Not to mention the insane launch price and the fact that the game is absent from the top selling titles on Steam.So, only buy this game if you are certain you'll be able to get some enjoyment out of it. If in doubt, wait for a discount. It's not that bad, it's actually pretty good. Too bad it's not really Ninja Gaiden."

This had lots of potential at the beginning of the game. But too many cutscences that disrupt the action during the beginning, as well as dumb boss fights. Do not bother with this one."

Too difficult and just not fun. At the end of the day a game has to be fun, otherwise why play it? Right? Not fun. Save your time on a game worth playing."
