You control only 2 units of a fixed size of respawning zombies, 1 monster who levels and gains 4 abilities, and your leader in a mobile base where the zombies respawn.The art style and music both make the game fun to play, it's just unfortunate the gameplay itself lets it down.  With so few units to control and no real abilities to trigger besides the over-powered monster you don't always have, the game is too simple and stops being fun very quickly."

,Recommended,252270,8024982,"Posted: 12 December, 2013",all,Drake,"Zombie Tycoon 2: Brainhov's Revenge is a fun, but simple and relatively short, RTS (that’s right, RTS not Tycoon. Not a clue why they did that, even after reading up on why they did do that). Your first run through the game’s 8 mission campaign, which is broke up between 2 different factions of 6 different types of zombies for 4 missions each, will only be about 3-4 hours. There is some replay value in obtaining all the secondary objects if you missed them the first time around but replaying the entire campaign again might only increase the life of this title to about 6-7 hours. It is a relatively cheap title though so I’d say dollar-per-hour value is ok with this one. The real feature I say about this title, which initially sold me and kept me going through til the end, is the graphic style and the crazy amount of character put into almost every aspect of the game. Every unit in the game has a ton of personality which is more than I can say for a lot of others games. The two scientists and their zombie minions made me chuckle several times in every cutscene. The way the game looks and sounds reminds me a lot of Evil Genius which is an amazing game so good off to whoever created all the models and behaviours of all the characters.In conclusion I’d fully recommend this game to anybody looking for a cheap, simple RTS that is exploding with charm and personality and I really hope this company makes a sequel, a real tycoon game or another RTS, with expanded mechanics aimed at a PC market."

I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be a good value for its price, especially since I picked'r up on sale. The campaign is fun, fluid, & the VS is also a nice way to relax without distancing yourself too much from a gaming atmosphere.What I would have liked to see from this game? A coop mode against the humans or ""rebel"" zombies; I'd be willing to spend another couple bucks on that dlc in a moment's notice."

The campaign has only 8 missions, which are typically very, very ... slow. You have only 2 squads and a monster (which is less interesting than it sounds). The AI is pretty bad (granted they are zombies, but still). Plenty of times my zombies were just standing somewhere while my houses were being taken over or my leader unit slapped up. The cutscenes are funny, but that's pretty much what you get for your hard earned money. It is definately a nice starting point for a game, with more squads, some more skills (your leader is now just a respawn point) and maybe some more ... gameplay. It could be nice, who knows a patch or DLC will someday makes this game worth the money. For now, I'd spend it on something else. Like waffles, nothing beats waffles..."

76561198005406191,Recommended,252270,32121223,Posted: 1 June,all,servvsumbrarum,"Greetings Everyone!  I’m not stranger to RTS games; they are my favored genre of gaming second only to RPGs and the two change places frequently.  I say this so that many will understand where I come from when deciding if I recommend this game.  At its heart we have a simple RTS that could find a good home on console or even a tablet, for the PC…well; it is a bit too slow for the average RTS gamer.Uncontrollable:  This game was obviously designed with a controller in mind.  I don’t mean this disrespectfully; I feel these games were needed to allow RTS games to slowly transition as a viable genre for the consoles but I feel the entire game is a bit too simplified for a mouse and keyboard.  The game seems balanced over the intention you are going to be struggling with the controls and not have access to the precision of a mouse.  A small soapbox:  I really wish mouse and keyboard options would just become standard options for a console; shouldn’t be more than a software upgrade but I digress!Childish:  I get the overwhelming feeling this game was meant for children, or at very least gamers who are not familiar with RTS as a genre.  If you are a veteran player of this genre you will get no challenge from this game.  You will also probably find the game boring.  The story is a bit silly and doesn’t really have any depth but is amusing at times.  I feel as they were trying to find an excuse to do a controller RTS with zombies and here you go; not necessarily a bad thing.But will it blend:  Ultimately, you know what you are getting here.  About 4 hours of simplified RTS that would be great for a child or someone new to the genre and for $5 I can get behind that.  The game is old but does seem to keep up graphically, audibly but could use some updates for modern graphic options.So, I’m going to say sure, why not.  For $5 and understanding that it would make a great entry to into the Genre then yes I’d recommend it.  This is the RTS equivalent of throwing someone Banjo for an entry into an enjoyable but approachable platformer.  So, if you have a child wanting to play games or never played an RTS here you go!"

You can't have more than 2 types of zombies at once wich is a nice touch for strategy but there's a down side. You control just a handful of zombies and it doesn't feel like an actual zombie overlord.Braihov's Revenge is a really fun game. I loved playing it.

It was interesting initially but quickly becomes stale. As you move through the campaign you only control Brainhov, two groups of zombies and a third ""hero"" unit that learns special abilities as it levels up.The art style is really nice but the gameplay is a let down. From the time I spent in the campaign I was just clicking to go from one side of the map to the other and in between i'd sit and wait while my units killed enemies before right clicking to the next location. This combination of controlling so few units and generic map objectives made me stop playing before I finished. I think it would have been more enjoyable if you could establish a base, create buildings, and raise an undead army to run over the map but I digress.Overall I'd rate the game 5/10. The art and music are great but the generic nature of the gameplay was the downfall."

Featuring both slow snd fast zombies. The slow zombies are big and tough and can take some hits. The fast zombies are skinny and weak but you usually get more of them in a unit. Both types of zombies take up jobs to help you get through puzzles. Hazmat zombies clean up damaging goo, Samurai zombies dash and slash their victims, and Engineer zombies operate machines to open paths for the mobil spawner. Humans arent a chooseable faction but are also your enemy in capaign mode.Pantsu's Rating (out of 5)Graphics: 4 It's cartoony graphics are clean and fit the world well. My only complaint is the lack of females, wether zombie, soldier, or survivor.Playability: 3.75 The controls are okay but I found myself selecting a unit instead of one of my large creatures abilities. (Units 1234, Abilities QWER)Fun: 3.75 Oh yeah it is fun. Taking over the neighborhoods house by house feels rewarding when you unleash the horde on the final gates. The leaders mobil spawner vehicle doesn't seem to have a way to reapair which kind of sucks since it can take lots of damage pretty fast.Sound: 3.5 The music fits the scene of zombies rampaging around the city. Not very useful outside the game unless you want some spookyish music for a Halloween party. The groans and grunts of the zombies differs between type and even jobs.Replay Value: 3 After the campaign mode, which teaches you how to play the game. There is multiplayer. You get to choose your faction, and your big moster then battle friends or strangers from across the globe.Final Score: 3.5Final Thought: A fun introduction to the RTS genre. At $9.99 it is worth waiting for a sale, but on a good note it is also sold as a 2 pack for a discount so you can get your friend a copy at the same time."
