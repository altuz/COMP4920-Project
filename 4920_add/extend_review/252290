As others have mentioned it's a little side scrolly thing where you explore an uninhabited little world via side scrolling, and there are writing promps, and you look at the background and stuff and invent backstories to write and you can read other people's stuff. It's not a 'game' in the traditional sense but it lets you be creative in ways the traditional video game can't, and it's a bit more stimulating than just firing up a word processor.The reason I don't recommend is because there are 3 worlds that each take about five minutes to get from one to the other, tops. Of course you're writing for much of it, but still, you're talking about MAYBE squeezing 3-4 hours out of it. I mean look at all the other reviewers: as of now there's one guy with 7 hours played out of the 29 positive reviews, and nobody else has hit 4 hours.Considering they aren't much more than slideshows that are a few minutes long, it breaks my heart that there are only 3 of them. Of course they are interesting and engaging and beautiful but seems like there are a lot of games that are all that and have MUCH more content. Might as well just browse art websites with a word processor window open for free,"

The concept seems stellar as a writing exercise, but then I completed it within a hour and a half. There are only three planets you can document, with little variety to find inspiration in. Replayability is nearly nonexistant, so I quickly uninstalled the game. If there were more areas to explore, this would be a more positive review. Go spend your fifteen dollars in a bookstore, and you'll have a much better experience."
,Not Recommended,252290,14375732,"Posted: 7 February, 2015",all,VSZM,The game is very innovative I must admit. The basic conception of writing your own story as you travel around in abandoned planets is amazing! The developers also added the feature of sharing these stories with your fellow gamers which is nice.So why am I givin a negative review?Because the actual content in the game could barely be any lower. There are 3 planets and each of them can be finished in a couple of minutes. I spent only ONE hour with the game and I even had time to read the top rated stories written by users for each of the 3 planets. This gets even worse if we consider the realatively high 15 € price tag.You should ONLY buy the game if you want to honor the developers for their original idea because you won't spend much time enjoying it.

Not enough of my kids found the atmosphere particularly appealing, and the prompts/fill-in-the-blanks-style activities, they complained, often pigeonholed them into writing ""sci-fi"" stories.I agreed with them. Writing this review fresh out of the game, I still do.But I don't see how this is entirely negative.I'm a sci-fi fan, and a writer, but I've seldom actually crossed both. A few of my students have felt similarly, too.If ""Elegy"" as inspired at least one of us - as it has - then, I recommend it."

I'm a professional author who got about 6 hours out of this game. So, unless you're clammering for something like this -right now-, I'd wait for this game to dip below $15.That being said, this game is a fun little adventure into inspiration and imagination. While you only have three worlds to explore, the evocative landscapes and the limits you can force yourself to work in can get some fun ideas flowing. This is especially true if you're a science fiction writer. Still, a writer of any genre can find use with this game.It's also real pretty. So there's that, too.However, I mostly want to write this review to show support for this game's concept. I would absolutely love to see this concept expanded upon: more worlds, more genres of story, easier ways to read other's work. So, my review's a little double-edged."

It is a 2-D side scroller where the objective is to write. It gives many writing prompts to help warm you up to the concept (mostly from romantic poets Byron, Keats, and Shelley in the public domain).This is not the part I like about the game. I like the freeform writing option. You are not limited to certain spots to write, and you are not confined to a previously written prompt. You can stop wherever you want and write whatever you want.The art and music are minimalistic yet stimulating. I find myself staying in one area and writing for a bit and then moving to the next area to seek more inspriation. This works, because the music and scenery change as you wander through the areas. Neither are overpowering and act as more of a white noise to help you maintain focus.I recommend this game to any writer. I would say it isn't necessarilly a $15-quality game, but if you are a writer, and it inspires your writing, then you cannot put a value on that."

Stunning art, enjoyable soundtrack and interesting writing prompts.There's definitely room for improvement; the gameplay can get boring since it is essentially just a side scroller, the worlds very limited at only 3. Worth it on sale! Not quite so the full price.

,Recommended,252290,13406006,"Posted: 16 December, 2014",all,Souza,"Less of a game than a series of writing exercises structured around a largely minimalist game framework, I nevertheless found myself sucked in rather rapidly. With three relatively small worlds to select from, and with a small number of writing objectives for each, the strength of Elegy isn't its gameplay, but rather its use as an artistic outlet. You get to create the story as you wish, either rigidly adhering to the framework they provide or starting from scratch, with nothing more to use than the aural and visual stimuli they provide.  Ultimately, at the end of each exercise, you then get to submit your work to be ""published"" throught the Steam Workshop of the game, where others can read and commend (or not) your efforts.  Likewise, you can read the interpretations of others for those same worlds, and commend them (or not) accordingly. It's a surprisingly engaging experience."

There's so much potential here, and the artwork really is superb - unfortunetly it seems that the developers, being personally satisfied with their creation, have little interest in expanding the game and adding features. I don't feel that my $15 was in any way wasted on this game - I'll keep playing it until I've at least had fun with some of the writing prompts, but for anyone thinking about buying: be aware that there are limitations to the game that may not be apparent simply from glancing at it or watching the trailer.Really what this feels like is a super polished beta of a real game - totally servicable, but refusing to live up to its potential."

The content is quite poor. I'd rather play random in youtube ""oniric songs"" or something along those lines.I think, as everyone does, that the idea is cool, but I found the implementation quite poor.

Essentially the only things to visually stimulate you are a few beautiful landscape backgrounds with a few moving parts and a handful objects. The idea is fine, but the content means that the game provides very limited stimulation. Other activities plus writing are just way more stimulating than this game designed for that purpose."
,Recommended,252290,13558093,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,potatocubed,"This is a game about walking the ruins of empty, dead worlds and writing about what you see and what you feel. It's a good introduction to writing from a prompt, and the three worlds presented all have somewhat different styles that suggest different storylines. Each also has several prompts, providing structures for your writing from prose to poetry to comedy songs, so even though there are only three worlds there's plenty of replay value in each. You can also read other people's creations based on the same prompts as you, which can be an interesting window into the writing of others and sometimes lets you stumble on a small-scale masterpiece or two.My only complaints - and they're trivial ones - are that the game does nudge you towards a somewhat melancholy outlook when writing, and if anything the visual cues aretoo goodat guiding people in their writing, leading to similarities in the stories written about each world even when using different prompts. But these really are minor issues.Also, I want more worlds to explore - but that's just me being greedy.If you're interested in writing, or just unusual games that are a step outside the norm, pick this up. Play once or twice through each world, read what other people have written, and you'll have your money's worth in no time."
,Recommended,252290,15130489,"Posted: 30 March, 2015",all,Remki,"Preface: This is a very SHORT ""game"". It honestly feels like a preview rather than the whole product. It's also certainly not for everyone. It's geared more towards the type of person who writes long headcanons for their villagers in Banished or create elaborate backstories for their Bioware characters. For people who have used programs like Zen Writer, this gets you into the same kind of simplified mindset-- there's nothing but you, the art, the sound, and the words. You won't get the editing and organizational capabilities of programs like Scrivener, but it's extremely useful for allowing you to write without the distraction of fiddly program features. That said, there's a lot to recommend it to gamers and writers alike.PROS+ Beautiful artwork. Like absolutely stunning.+ Great prompts-- just enough to get you thinking if you need them, but without guiding you too much+ Export option-- love the ability to export your stories, though only as HTMLCONS- Too short! Needs many more worlds, with more complexity- No spell check- Space available for writing is limited to 1000 characters per prompt-- definitely not enough when you're on a roll!- No ability to export as a simple word or txt document- Atmospheric sounds are good, but repetitive (and loud!)What I would dearly love is a game that expands on the worlds available by tenfold, and that gives a more comprehensive writing program with adjustable capabilities.SUGGESTIONS (just in case the devs ever want to expand or someone wants to make a similar program)* Add a lot more worlds* Spell check during edit mode* Quick access to each prompt area on a world from the end menu, with short previews of each prompt text (so that users don't have to read through each area chronologically to find where they want to edit).* Include a manual save option so that we can simply press, say, f11 to save without closing the prompt box* Unlock the word limit for each prompt area* Allow users to import music from their hard drive into a ""writing playlist"" (like Zen Writer) to use when they don't want to listen to the in-game music/sounds.* On-Screen volume control* Export to text document option"

Also, the explorable areas are quite small: I hoped there would be a much larger world to explore.

The majority of the reviews are extremely positive, and I love to write. If my expectations were a bit too high, well.. Sorry.Actual Gameplay: Lacking. Honestly, I was extremely excited when I first saw this. I started it up, and saw an impressive starting point. It seemed as though I was floating around in a nebula, with a jetpack to propel me where I wanted to go. 'Whoa.' Was pretty much my first thought. Then I jumped into a wormhole/portal and got down to the writing part. It turns out, it just shows you a 3D-ish landscape in which you can move forwards and backwards. Around the place are little 'Prompts' that start you off with a few words. You are supposed to continue on from these promts, or if you are unhappy with what they said, you can change it. Personally, I found that it felt like a joke. ""And here is a church where the worshipped-"" and you were supposed to fill it in. Another example: ""Here is a school were children were taught-"" Again, continue on. If you read through other peoples work, then you would see random words jumbled together, or lackluster 'Poetry'.

Instead it's just entry level writing prompts that you have to walk to. Nothing engaging. It's text from a free writing guide mixed with a unity adventure game but sold as a full product. I'm incredibly disappointed and wish Steam would impliment a return policy."

The only reason I am here on Steam is because of Elegy for a Dead World.I will first describe my motivations behind the said-sole reason a little bit, before I share about my experiences in the game and what I think of it.As a writer and casual gamer, I was absolutely thrilled to discover this game some months back. A game where one can write?? Who knew that writing and gaming would one day be so elegantly combined?I wanted it so much that it was at the top of my wishlist from the moment I read about its existence. I waited patiently until I had the right time to do whatever I needed to do to get my hands on the game. Install Steam, even though I never had plans to do so previously. Purchase Elegy for a Dead World, even though I had never purchased any games or in-game purchases. This was the game that would make me change my plans.And was the plunge worth it? Oh hell yeah.I loved the gorgeous visuals that greeted me when the game launched. I chose to enter Keats' world, and I was not dissapointed. It was simply breathtaking, so beautiful that I explored so slowly, just to soak in the views, notice all the little details.  The audio crept up on me, mysterious, subtle, haunting, but never too overwhelming, which helps to evoke the atmosphere of the world. All these little things add up to create a richly-inspiring landscape, which is very helpful to writing if you ask me.But the best bit was, of course, the writing. I was surprised to find that there are several types of prompts to choose from, which would definitely allow me to revisit the same world multiple times, because different sets of prompts would inspire completely different tales in my head. One of the choice of freeform writing is fantastic too. Even though I really appreciated the prompts triggering my imagination and creativity, I like knowing that I do have the choice to use the freedom to write whatever I want in that world.My first try was to fill in the blanks at Keats' world. Not only did I enjoy the act of writing a tale inspired by such a breathtaking setting, my brain was already coming up with ongoing streams of ideas even before I received each prompt. The prompts were at first surprising, but I went with the challenge to create a tale that was shaped by both the prompts and my own words. I was again delightfully surprised to learn that I could edit the given prompts too, which further spurred my creativity as I played with various ideas and phrases until I was satisfied. This took me approximately one and half hours as I crafted and then refined my story.Suffice to say, it was a real treat, happiness and satisfaction swelling in me as I finished that first story. I have since went back to Keats' world for a second visit using a different set of prompts. I still have several other ideas to write about that place. My plan is to try all the different prompts, and then attempt the freeform writing, and possibly go back for yet another try if I want to. I will do this slowly, over the weeks and months to come. I have yet to even touch Byron's and Shelley's world. I expect the other two worlds to be no doubt as breathtaking and inspiring as Keats', serving as the springboard to many more tales.Oh, and gameplay has been quite smooth. No major glitches. As long as I can write without disruptions, I am happy.One thing I will say about this game is that while it has been an enjoyable ride, I don't think it is for everybody. The reason why I enjoy it so much is because I derive a lot of pleasure from writing. My internal drive to write is why the gorgeous visuals and mysterious audio only added to the richness of the scene before my eyes, amplifying my enjoyment of the writing experience. How could I not enjoy the writing process when I could get inspiration in spades from this game? There are also, of course, some who will greatly benefit from the breathtaking visuals as a starting point and be inspired to write about it. But I doubt that everyone will enjoy the writing process as much.If you're the type to glance at a scene and want to move on to something different within a short period of time, this might not be the game for you. But if you're the type who could marvel and admire a richly detailed scene for a long time, or if you're the type who could come back to the same scene to discover something new every time, then I would recommend Elegy for a Dead World. And if you like writing or plan to try it, I would also recommend this game.It has been a rewarding journey so far, and I have just started. I cannot wait to see my future tales unfold in the three amazingly breathtaking worlds. I don't know the final forms of the stories, but I'm damn sure that I will find inspiration every time I visit one of the worlds."

It has a beautiful, unique art style and hits that odd sci-fi feel perfectly. Each world creates a unique atmosphere and each one can make an interesting story, along with the unique prompts and situations. Reading other people's stories is a delight as well, and some of them can be exceptionally funny. If you do buy this game, I recommend you go to the world in the right hand corner and look at the most popular story, because by god is that an amazing story. ""T-Bone Steaks in the Sky"". 10/10"
76561198309365983,Recommended,252290,34884991,Posted: 11 September,all,EternalNoob,"As a game whose function is to basiclly redefine what a video game can do and could be in the first place, I would say this game accomplishes what it sets out to do. Its strongest merit is its simplicity. It doesn't advertise as being anything else than a writing game. It gives you some visuals (all of which are beautifully done in a unique color pallete in 2D art), some atmospheric sound desgin, and a a few words or a sentence with which you can let your creative juices flow. Sometimes it's a letter to a person, sometimes it's a fictional historical analysis about the long gone alien civilizations you are observing. Either way, There's really nothing more to this game as far as ""gameplay"" for lack of a better word, and if you enjoy creative writing and well done 2D art, than that should be enough for you to enjoy.It may seem strange to spend money on what may at first glance appear to be some writing prompts, but Elegy is more than that. It is about giving you a cool, atmospheric environment with which to inspire you. Because of this, it can be a relaxing and theraputic experience.It's not what you want to pull up for excitement, but it's what you'll want to pull up to just settle down and let your creativity flow and to enjoy some nice relaxing visuals, sounds, and---most importantly---some good writing sessions."
,Recommended,252290,35157870,Posted: 23 September,all,RoxyWolf,"Elegy for a Dead World is a hard one to recommend. I personally feel it has very limited appeal; it's about as niche as it gets. It is a game about writing, either from a prompt or from your own ideas, and leaving the notes scattered around one of a few different abandoned worlds which you can explore for inspiration. If you so desire, you can share your works in the workshop for others to read. There are some good ones out there.The draw of the game is the ability to write about the world -- a sort of ""make your own fun"" kind of adventure. However, you only get about a page and a half of space to work with for each note. Constraints can be good, but I personally found the brevity a little jarring: there isn't even a character counter to let you know how much space you've filled up -- I just typed until I hit a wall, and then I was forced to go back and rework everything to fit within the constraints. It was a nice little diversion, but honestly, I don't think the game has enough going on to pull me back very often at all.The worlds themselves are very small, but pretty enough to look at despite how little there is to them. You can probably explore every inch of the whole universe in under ten minutes, unfortunately. I wish there were more variation in world type... and more to each one, too. I feel as though this game would have more replay value if there were more to it -- more prompts, more worlds, and perhaps, more space in which to write.Ultimately, Elegy for a Dead World isn't a bad game. It works, for what it is, and though it might not be to everyone's tastes, that aspect alone isn't enough to make it unreccommendable. If you enjoy writing, or reading the writing of others, it might just find a place in your library."
