This game creates a sense of nostalgia and it has over 20 different retro graphic flavors to choose from. This is an old school love letter and every shmup fun should try it.Pros: old school flavor, fast paced, nice modern 2.5d visuals, various graphic options ranging from Amiga to C64, survival mode is addicting and fun, 3 space ships to choose from which feel different and unique, music tracks are excellent, No bugs or glitches experienced after 9 hrs of gameplay. Difficulty is just right and challenging (not very easy but also not very hard like some Japanese shmups). You can also choose between 4 difficulty settings.Cons: very short with only 6 levels. You will need approx 2 hrs to complete the game It could have use more enemy variation, more bosses and more environments.PS:Developers support and show love for their game, they talk in (steam) forums with users and they also promised more free content in the future.Final score: 08/10 (if you have any interest in shmups you should definitely try it) Demo is also available for download at the developers webpage"

,Recommended,252310,7477374,"Posted: 25 October, 2013",all,CueZero,"Syder Arcade is a holy matrimony of old-school arcade aesthetics bursting with modern bullet-hell flare. Easing right into the hands of arcade connoisseurs, the game's layout resembles something akin to the classic, Defender, but with the pulse-pounding reflexes and challenge you would expect from a Treasure or Cave shmup such as Ikaruga or Progear.The difficulty keeps you on the edge at all times, inviting arcade cabinet veterans to feel right at home while still managing the accessibility to always be just within reach of the newest, most curious shmup fan. In the end, the biggest challenge is stopping yourself from going for that ""one last highscore!"" again and again."

Shot game but fun and easy to pick up anytime because the controls are simple, only 6 missions but of those six none are garbage their all pretty awesome.

,Recommended,252310,8707057,"Posted: 14 January, 2014",all,GenPattonBR,"Great game!Syder Arcade takes me back to my old days of MSX gaming in the 80's, when  I used to play the Nemesis Saga games (Nemesis, Salamander, Gradius, and all of their sequels) with the MSX plugged to a color TV.Syder Arcade does provide some of that feeling: the music is excellent, that sounds like the old 3-voices digitalized musics of the 80's arcades.Another thing I liked is the default key controls: Z / X to shoot and arrow keys to move. For those who are unaware, the MSX keyboards had huge arrow keys, specially designed for games. I loved it!However, there are some flaws.1) It is not possible to leave the game in between phases, because the ESC key won't work until the game has started. So you are forced to go through the cut scenes between levels and wait until the game has started.2) Unlike the games from the 80's, there are too many visual elements in the game and sometimes it is hard to tell between something that is ""shootable"" and something that isn't.3) there are no hints or clues to what the difficulty levels are, since its names aren't very intuitive. Actually, there isn't a single hint in the menus!4) There is too much story in the cut scenes. Sometimes I just want to get to business and start shooting. I don't care about the plot or the background story! I didn't care when I was 14, I won't care now!Other than that and a few other minor flaws, it is a very nice game and I am very glad I got it. I've been acumulating hours on the game! I hightly recommend this game."
,Recommended,252310,11278675,"Posted: 16 July, 2014",all,arleas,"This game is a throwback to all the R-Type wannabe games from the 80's and 90's.  The music had that perfect ""Amiga 500"" feel to it, and the game's style in general made me think of some of the old shooters from that era as well.You get 4 different types of ships to choose from with different movement, fire, armor, and special weapon capabilities.  Each one gives the levels its own particular flavor of challenge to it.  Instead of being a straight up ""Fly to the right infinitely while destroying bad guys who attack in predictable patterns"" style of shooter, they offer you the chance to flip between left and right so you can turn around and shoot those♥♥♥♥♥holes that come at you from behind.Much like R-Type there's a multitude of in-game powerups you can pick up which you find after destroying enemies or waves of enemies, and there's also a plain looking white box style powerup that apparently adds to your special weapon charge. (though I'm not sure how that works exactly because it seemed like I was able to fire my special pretty often).Also if that's not enough nostalgia for you, there's a variety of in-game graphic filters so you can pretend you're playing it on a 4 bit greyscale screen, 8 bit greyscale, Vic-20, C-64, ZX Spectrum, Amiga HAM (Hold And Modify mode), EGA, CGA, and modern graphics (I may have left something out though).It's challenging without being too frustrating, it's got just enough bullet hell without forcing you to become the zen master at dodging everything, and the graphics and music complete the experience."
,Recommended,252310,13000498,"Posted: 18 November, 2014",all,pepsimanvsjoe,"This is a free-scrolling 2D shooter. Unlike most shmups, you're free to turn around to destroy your enemies behind you as well as terminate anything that would dare attempt a frontal assault. It's kinda like Defender, except levels don't wrap-around. In fact if you hit either end of the level you'll bounce away like you were hit by a galactic tennis racquet.The story is about aliens or pirates or hot babes or I can't remember. Basically it's an excuse to have six stages of blastemup action. You're given a choice between four ships, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Each ships has its own special weapon that does great damage while putting up a temporary shield. Unlike most other shooters, the federation gave you an actual armored ship. In short, you don't die in a single hit, unless you crash into something, or play on the ""pure"" difficulty which all but removes armor.The campaign has a decent amount of variety to it. First stage is the bog-standard destroy everything, second is an escort mission (ewww), third you're expected to survive for several minutes. By the 4th stage you're fighting off a pirate armada, 5th has you taking on alien battleships, and finally the last stage you're trying to outrun a storm to destroy a...thing. I think this thing is dangerous to the human race so yeah, definitely blow it up.There are three survival stages as well. First one can get pretty difficult, you're most likely going to die in 6 to 10 minutes. The second one you have to race through a passage of ice to destroy another thing. I don't get along well with 3D walls in shmups, I tend to do a lot of crashing. I don't know what the deal is with the third survival stage. It's wave-based, but nothing happens after I blow up the juggernaut, no more enemies appear or anything.The score is mostly influenced by the difficulty. The harder the setting, the better the score. There are a bunch of medals that are awarded for performing certain tasks (dodging a lot of bullets, getting combos, etc) so look out for those as well.There's not much else to say about this game really. It's not bad, though I think the player weapons are a little underpowered. This is especially apparent in survival stage 1, where it can get overwhelming simply because it takes too long to destroy the boss ships. Also when you lose a life, your ship doesn't really explode and disappear or anything. Perhaps the next ship could fly in from the foreground. Half the time it looks like I just took damage, but now I'm down a life. It's an odd feeling. I'd rather have a brief moment to realize ""Yup...I died. I better not suck as much next time."" like every other shooter. Also in the third stage, enemy bullets can get lost in the sunny background. This has never caused me to die, but I'll wager it happened to somebody.And uh...that's it. No really, I've stretched myself thin as it is. Syder Arcade is a decent enough game. It's nothing fantastic, but it checks all my boxes."

First of all i have to say that i love SHMUP's (Eastern style and Western style) and boy this one suprised me. There are six campaign level's and four difficulty level's and i have to admit that i got trough them all maybe too easy though on lowest setting. You have three ships to choose from which differ at speed/armor and normal weaponry and special attack.In this gorgeous, yes gorgeous because graphics are amazing for SHMUP, there are all the things happening in the background. The game is 3D though you can move only in 2D which is great and the ship effect's, explosions and bosses look fantastastic. I could not ask for more.The gameplay itself is not just simply go to one direction because you can flip your ship and you will have to do it alot, yeah have an radar of the whole screen and every single mission has different objectives. One time you may have to just kill the boss, next time you must protect you battleship etc. So it shows variancy which is usually rare in these kind of games. Addition to campaign there is Survival which is exactly as it sounds.So all the SHMUP fans and even not an SHMUP fan. You want to try this out! And i mean it!"

The campaign contains about an hour's worth of content.  There's the survival mode, but it's only good for short bursts.  Once you've beaten the campaign on the highest difficulty, I can't imagine you'd want to play it much more unless you're a die hard shoot em up fan that just has to get to the top of the leaderboard.  If the game were cheaper, I would probably give it a thumbs up, but there are better games to buy if you want this kind of thing.  Compare this to a game like Jets N Guns Gold, which gives you like 20x the content for a better price, and it's hard to recommend this."

,Not Recommended,252310,10099763,"Posted: 13 May, 2014",all,Astwihados,"Now, before you decide to bash me for disapproving this game, please let me reflect some of my thoughts.Syder Arcade is your typical spaceship shooter, that's ok to me, I like them a lot, even if they can get so generic. This game is sort of cheap 2.5D version of Defender, there is no doubt about that. 2.5D feels a little like unnecessary memory allocation and doesn't offer much gameplay-wise, other than giving you false impression of things you can touch and cannot, such as landscapes. Retro filters are nice idea, but in the end they are just video filters that make it harder to see what's going on, making some of the small enemy projectiles rather sneaky. I have seen games that do the same thing with changing whole tilesets and sprites while still giving the same feel to the game but offering fresh look at the game. Syder Arcade fails to impress here but I like the idea it is going for. There is no excuse. Just not fair enough.You have four initial ships to choose from, but other than having different kind of weapons they don't make gameplay feel much different from each other. Variety is always a good thing tho, even when minimal. I like the way ships look. Enemy variety on the other hand is quite low profile and you'll be shooting through same masses over and over again. Luckily game has just handful of levels. There was a story mode too, but as an arcade man I couldn't care about anything that takes more than 2 lines. Tried reading it too, but it wasn't interesting or cheesy enough. But that could be just me. It is there though if you want it.Controls are kinda stiff. Sometimes its very hard to dodge projectiles or enemies even with fastest ship. Hard to spot projectiles don't help much. I tried using arcade stick for maximum potential but it still felt kind of slow. Scoring system has nice idea to it with badges and such, but very often you get exactly the same ones. I chuckled at the easiest difficulty describing the player growing up with modern consoles because that is exactly what comes to my mind with this game.In conclusion I don't know who Syder is and I don't feel much of arcade about it. It is kind of okay, but at the same time a stub of a shooter to say at least. If you are in for old school shooters or modern bullet hell/shmups you're not going to enjoy Syder Arcade as much as the game wants to suggest. For one it has nice music, but the game could evolve a lot."
,Recommended,252310,16277222,"Posted: 9 June, 2015",all,Weird Alice,"Sometimes you just want a game that you can jump into a have some fun.  This is definitely one of those games.  I can't really speak too much on the gameplay because, well, it's a shooter.  It's pretty much what you'd expect.  Also I'm no where near the leading authority on shooters as the closest game I can compare this too is Sexy Parodius and I don't know if that's a far comparison.  It's just fun.The only downsides are that it takes a little too long to get back into the action once you've died on survival mode (it takes you back to the main menu).  It really only takes a few seconds to get back in, but it'd be nice if there was an option to just start the level again right away.  I also wish there were more levels and ships to choose from.  Other than that you really can't go wrong if you're just looking for fun without the complex story lines or leveling system."
,Recommended,252310,29419404,Posted: 22 January,all,Capt_Blakhelm,"Syder Arcade is a pretty decent side scroller shoot em up that I was able to complete within about 2 hours. The player is set in an horizontal arena and will either need to destroy all the enemies, escort carrier ship, or defend other large ships. The ship moves at a set speed and will go faster if you continue in one direction, but you will often need to flip around to deal with enemies on either side. Some enemies drop speed upgrades, weapon upgrades, and refiles for your health and secondary shot, which vary depending on your ship choice. The different playable ships also have different speeds and armor ratings.I appreciate the the optional graphic filters that makes the game look like various old computer systems, but the game's visual design wasn't built for it, so the reduced colors, pixelation filter, and clashing smoothness of the actual game make them terrible for actual gameplay are they are essentially useless other than giving players a nostalgia trip - the CGA filters reminded my childhood Tandy PC that only had 4 colors in games.$10 feels a bit much for a 2 Hour shmup. You can get some replayability by playing again with a different ship or playing survival mode. I'm pretty sure I got this on sale and I suggest you do the same."

,Recommended,252310,14688559,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,Kabookie,"Syder Arcade is a wonderful title that has brought all of the good components from the 90s arcade side-scrolling shooters into the modern-day era. Developed by Studio Evil, you are a singular ship thrown against innumerable amounts of enemy crafts to accomplish different missions, ranging from protecting a friendly but immense warship through an asteroid field, to simply destroying every ship that you aren’t piloting. These six missions are delivered to you in sequence in the form of a simple yet endearing storyline, and after a good ten minutes of flying around space with a level of skill that you can look back and be proud of, you can compare your scores to all the other pilots out there.Immediately upon launching the game, you will notice the graphics, which can only be described as stunning. Even the menu screen is pleasing to look at and simple to navigate. The game also offers a “GFX” setting on this menu where you can select from between 20 different graphics filters. These filters are great fun to play around with, and some will certainly bring back memories of days gone by for older gamers while the more modern filters are very impressive for gamers who are perhaps not old enough for the nostalgia to extend to them. The graphics really shine through during the fighting; if you can manage to tear your eyes off of the seemingly unavoidable shots being fired at you for even a second, you will be able to appreciate the asteroid belts in the background and even the amount of effort and detail that has gone into the mines – which will only be on your screen for a few seconds before they violently explode."

There are also various retro filters you can play with, so that you can see how the game would have looked if you still had a c64, amiga or spectrum. The game is fairly fast paced, the story was script up by crayon, it basically consists of here's the enemy go blow things up. Relatively bug free, though I have myself experienced some comical glitches in the game, like the storm on the last level sometimes has a mind of its own and can even go through the warp gate with you.Music decent and groovy, the weapons and ships are cool and versatile, my personal favorite is the wasp with machine gun and special weapon activated. Basically it says 'get out of my way i'm coming through!'The game was actually suppose to be a prequel to a upcoming game called 'Syder Universe' which the developers never really got off the ground. Even though this is their first game they have kind of lost interest for some reason and are trying to make a name for themselves with other projects. But by shifting their attention so quickly and not giving the customers things that they desire, they inadverty do make a name for themselves, but maybe one that is not so flattering. Because this is a really decent product, but short with content, throngs of gamers have expressed a desire for more levels both in campaign and survival and I myself would love to see that.Achievement hunters may be somewhat perplexed with this game as several achievements require high score leaderboard requirements. Leaderboards more often than not showcase the results of numerous cheaters who often have scores demonstrating 100 million above everyone else. Biggest problem is that the developers every blue moon reset the leaderboard tallies. So gaining these achievements maybe taxing on serious achievment hunters. While some of these achievements seem more to be governed by the submitting of your score to the global score than the actual score itself being that important, it must be noted that this is only an expressed view of a handful gamers and no one really knows for sure how these achievements work as developers seem to largely ignore the fan base and ignore many queeries in the Steam forums.Final thoughts is that the developers have used this game to showcase their talents and have also sadly at the same time displayed a barrage of false promises, inconsistencies with feedback and a lack of overall dedication to their first product. Still enjoyed it, but sad that the developers carelessness left many frustrated with the lack of content and with infuriating unrealistic leaderboards."

I got used to it pretty quick tho.I'm not sure how many levels there are..but guessing from the menu I made it to the last mission (wich i failed) in the first sitting wich was just 50 minutes.Maybe theres extra stuff to come or extra campaigns to unlock.If there isnt i'd kinda wish for some more levels...given that i bought the game when it was 75% off, I feel like I still got enuff out of it.Recommend this to anyone thats looking for some retro shooting feel..easy to pick up, doesnt eat up all your time...basicly a nice package overall."

However, the genre is not entirely forgotten, with the occasional title like Syder Arcade coming along.The best that I can describe it for old-school gamers is to take an R-Type or Thunderforce IV, and give it controls akin to Defender where you can turn around and have a long range radar.For those not familiar with the genre, you're a lone spaceship that has to kill lots and lots of enemies. You can move at any angle, but generally enemy attacks come from the left and right of you. There are lots of items to collect to power up your guns. There are several stages to complete, most of which are the get-to-the-end variety, but also an escort mission, and there are a few bosses to defeat as well.First the good part - the graphics are bright and colorful, and even when the bullets come heavily you can usually tell where you are and what's going on. The controls are tight, and there are several types of ships that change gameplay quite significantly.  There are a variety of skill levels to insure that novices and experts alike can enjoy the game without too much frustration. The music is good, and it's a generally fun game.It's not perfect, however. There are not a ton of stages to play, and they lack variety. The bosses are rather similar and unimaginative. The tacked on story is skip-worthy.Overall, however, this is a fun little indie time-waster, and I am glad that I bought it. Definite thumbs-up."

Lovely.So, what exactely is this, you still ask?It's a 2D sidescroller, scrolling to both sides (you can flip and change direction at will) with lot's of spacey weapons.All you need to do is to shoot everything that moves and if something doesn't move, shoot it anyways.A bit more details about the game:- Gameplay:Very solid, very fun, easy to handle yet hard to master, i.e. the game handles and plays very well and smooth but challanges you hard at times.The direction change is a neat addition to the mechanics, at first it seems ""nice"" but after playing the game for some more it really adds a lot - the levels sometimes fell a bit bigger and more important you don't have to wait for the ""rear-shot"" powerup to hit enemies that passed you, you just turn around and shoot them anyways :-D- Graphics:""2.5D"" can - when done well - look amazing while not disturbing the pure 2D nature of the game.And this one is done really well!While the game and all it's environments / levels are sole 2D, the actual grahpic is rendered using 3D models.Looks great, plays well.- Music:An amazing soundtrack that is a huge homage to ""chip tunes"" and really drills into your ears, you might catch yourself keeping the game running just to have the music playing."

It's the classic gameplay, simple yet challenging fast-forward shoot'em up action. Switchable add-ons, mega weapons that you need to charge before using them (and keeping you on the edge of your seat while loading - will the ship withstand the enemies' fire? Will - hell, yeah - take that -> whoosh!), it's all in here.GraphicsSide scrollers have always been titles that caught their audiences with great graphics. ""Syder Arcade"" is in no ways inferior to the classics. It really shines (not only) in this category. Be it the explosions, the 2.5 backgrounds, weapons, beams - this one really shines!Fantastic extra: Of course you can play with contemporary graphics, but you can also choose from several old school modes like pixelated, greyscale, C64ish, Amiga style, CGA, EGA, VGA (320, 640) and many more.Sounds & MusicThe combination of old school- and modern styles continues. While the sound effects are rich and deep in sound itself, they're also classic for this genre. As for the music: I *LOVE* the score. Instead of using modern synths only, you'll get those awesome (and imho way more ""organic"") analog synthesizer sounds, too, which are genre defining not only in games, but movies as well.@Evil Studio: Is there any possibility of getting the soundtrack? Would be a great addition to my 80ies Synth Collection).Great ControlsWell, ok - what's to say about controls? You've got a classic 2D side scroller here featuring classic gameplay, so don't expect exczessive controller overkill. Studio Evil has done a very nice and also classic job on the controls here, so don't worry about getting entangeled in complicated keyboard layouts, just fire away. Just like the graphics: Thumbs up, guys!Bottom lineOne thing is for sure: The developers don't just *know* the genre, they obviously seem to *love* it. ""Syder Arcade"" is one of those rare titles nowadays, that really live up to the expecations of old school gamers (like myself) on the one hand, but can also bring good results in keeping things fresh and ready for a whole new generation of gamers.Fantastic graphics combined with controls that are easily accessible with no troubles at all and a special treat for old school gamers, ""Syder Arcade"" grants a fantastic blast from the past done right, with either contemporary or classic graphis and a darn high replayability."

The levels are essentially long rectangles (don't wrap around at the sides). The enemies and collectibles (powerups, bonus points, ...) are shown at the map, as well as the players position.The graphics in the game look good and it also comes with a bunch of different filters to emulate various retro gaming platforms. These are fun for nostalgic values, but not so much in the main game.The enemy bullets stand out well, which alone is enough to put this ahead of Ether Vapor Remaster, even if the story mode is far shorter.The 'story mode' is a pretty short and simple affair - only a handful of levels with a plot that leaves huge gaps between levels. This mode is more or less a throwaway - the survival mode by comparison will take up most of the player's time.The survival modes have endlessly spawning enemies in one single map. The ship always starts with the poorest weapons. The biggest problem here is that after dying, I haven't noticed a ""Retry"" option. Instead, the game throws the player to the main menu and the earlier selections I made are not stored, so just hammering the A button will just take me to the campaign, not the survival mode. Then the player has to choose the ship and the level again, which takes some time (loading and transition animations). This is a UI design problem.As expected, the survival modes have online leaderboards.There are a number of ships to choose from with different weapons and speed/armor values. There are also several difficulty levels to choose from.I have encountered two things I'd call bugs. First, in the last campaign level, dying can result in the ship respawning inside rock. Cue an instant death. And the next respawn can also result in the very same thing. Second, again in the last campaign level, I must've missed something since I couldn't get the final enemy's first lock to revolve. Maybe the storm hadn't progressed far enough, but it wasn't moving anywhere either."

Even though they tried something interesting with the camera (a-la Einhander), it fails because enemies come from behind. The angle hurts awareness.Oh yes, I have to mention enemies coming from behind, good idea but doesn't work great in the end. Finally, it's very hard to differentiate your bullets and the AIs bullets. They are similar colors and shape. This leads to some un-deserved deaths.I'd say only buy it on special and if you are REALLY reminicent of horizontal shmups.

On the surface that's true, but it is missing the best part of either.Defender is a game of strategy, the player has lots of options (go left or go right, should I attempt to save a humanoid or take down those enemy's one screen over, when things get bad should I use a bomb or do I risk a warp). This game has none of that strategy: in the campaign you are either on offense and you go from left to right killing everything, or your on defense and you keep on ping-ponging between left and right killing everything. In survival you cannot just kill everything, but the enemy density is so uniform that whether you move left or right hardly matters, the entire playspace is equally full of enemies.If you are looking for choices beyond what to kill next there is the decision or what power-ups to risk getting or not. Except it doesn't matter, all of the power-ups are incredibly weak and boring; for example: the side shot ability shots 2 bullets perpendicular to your ship's in-built machine gun. This gun could be incredibly powerful to keep enemies on your flanks from destroying you, except the gun is so weak it takes at minimum 3 seconds to kill the weakest enemy in the game with it, and this is a game where the screen is flooded with enemies. Why should I bother picking up a power-up that is so uselessly weak?Clearly this game doesn't measure up to Defender, but it doesn't measure up to bullet hell shooters either. The best bullet hell shooters are about making the player incredibly powerful while simultaneously being incredibly weak, a hose of damage that can be destroyed at a moment. That isn't the choice the designers of this game went with; instead it is a battle of attrition where both you and your enemies have large health bars and take quite a bit of time to kill. And while you do need to constantly dodge dozens of bullets at a time, the game moves at a fairly slow pace for the genre so twitch skills are not required.The game doesn't have strategy, its not very twitchy, its just a mediocre shooter. I suggest if you are looking for a game that has strategy like Defender and twitchy bullet hell just wait for Ikaruga to be released on Steam.(note: I only played the game for an hour, but that was enough time to beat the campaign and play survival several times. There do not appear to be any additional unlocks so I have tried all of the content this game has on offer within that hour.)"

There is just one thing that makes it annoying though, because at this point I end up dying so quickly as there is only one life, it does take a few button clicks to reply the same ship in the same environment. That kills the flow. A reply this button at end of game would be awesome (hint)."

Flight seems somehow unnatural and unresponsive.  Enemy ships seem to mostly idly float without much for distinctive flight patterns, and seem to be oblivious or unaware of player's position.Graphics seem to be a bit slow, choppy and unresponsive.  This was running on a Windows 7 workstation PC with on-board graphics however.  Even so, there is no option to go to a resolution less than 1024x768 which could speed up the graphics probably.Appears to use some voice samples from an old Commodore 64 EPYX game ""Impossible Mission"", which unless permission has been granted is copyrighted material.  Also it seems that a background computer chatter noise is taken from the 1990's television show Star Trek: Next Generation, but I could be wrong about that.User interface for menu is awkward and often unclear.  For example, ...given a Yes/No choice to post to online high scores, it is not obvious which option is highlighted (blue or white?) and you have a 50/50 chance of getting the right option.  Also when remapping keystrokes, pressing <ESC> will actually cancel the process instead of registering as the actual mapped key <ESC>.  On some menus, there is no ""back"" option and user is assumed to know to press <ESC> to go back.  Also, menu vertical stack does not wrap around, forcing player to move through entire list instead of pressing <up> at the top of stack to wrap to the bottom of the list."

The game is very challenging and the stages keep you on your toes at all times.  Playing on the highest difficulty setting will sharpen your reflexes and test your rage.This game has a truly classic arcade style with great graphics, excellent music and extremely addictive gameplay.  The very best part about this game is figuring out all of the little nuances surrounding the scoring, and trying to figure out the most efficient way to clear a stage to eek those extra points out of it.  It doesn't make these things obvious, you must be very observant to learn the more intricate scoring mechanics.Syder Arcade is one of my most favourite games on Steam, I definitely recommend to anyone who loves fast-action scrolling shooters."
,Recommended,252310,26564179,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Matt Fryer,"Pleasantly surprised, a good game if you like games like R-Type, in this game you can move left and right and flip the ship which is a nice touch, the controls are responsive and smooth. The game feels polished and the graphics are quite cool with various options to change them to look more retro / modern etc. The only complaints I have is that it's sometimes quite hard to know if something is part of the background scenery or the foreground and therefore I'm not sure what obstacles are obstacles and what are part of the background scenery, I also can't launch this game from Big Picture Mode in Steam, if I try it doesn't launch and I receive an error message. I can only launch this game once I've exited Big Picture Mode. This game works well with the Steam Controller although the buttons don't map as shown in the game. I often have problems with the Steam Controller and think they are Mac specific bugs, I can often find a workaround with a little configuration of the controller but I find this very annoying, this game does work well with the controller though, just with a slightly different configuration than the game shows. All in all just the sort of game I was looking for and a reasonable price : )"

Rather down to earth but still way above average in almost every way.4 ships to satisfy your playstyle, various graphic styles to choose from, plenty of difficulties to match your skill...although the bullet hell veteran will find even the hardest ones not too challenging. Endless modes are more difficult and actually prove to be a challenge."
