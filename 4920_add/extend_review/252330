,Recommended,252330,9463064,"Posted: 13 March, 2014",all,Ov3RT4K3R,"Slender: The Arrival is a first person adventure game. You are only equipped with a flashlight. You have to explore various locations and search for clues to your friend's whereabouts, while avoiding an unspeakable fate at the hands of Slender man himself. On your way you can pick up various papers that give you background information on the story, or clues.There are no problems with controls and everything feels very smooth. The game itself is too short, it takes around 1 hour to finish.The graphics are good, you will not be disappointed. Slender Man himself looks awesome, in my opinion this is the best Slender Man model of every Slender game. Everything else in the game, from the trees, to the rocks and so on looks pretty well, no complaints here.The music is great, it really adds to the experience. You can hear that slow thumping in the background from the original Slender game when you pick up that first page in one of the levels. The sound effects are also good, sometimes you will hear the sounds of footsteps from someone or something other than you in the forest close by, or you will hear the Owls hooting at night, and other various forest sounds.I can recommend Slender: The Arrival to people who wants a good fun scare or a nice horror game and of course all fans of the original Slender Man game. Fans of the original Slender will be happy to know that the original game is remade in one of the levels.Sounds 8/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA"

Beautiful graphics, great suspense building and effective jumpscares. Only downside, was very brief, could realistically finish it in 2 hours. Took me 3.6 because I'm a thorough explorer and I died a lot... first time I saw Slender I just ran right up to him to say hi... But other than that, it's much better than expected. And well worth it at the sale price of 3.99. I would place it somewhere between The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Outlast, as far as style and gameplay. If you like either one of those, and a good jumpscare, you'll like this one. The story seemed like a prologue, so hopefully it's just The Arrival and we'll see some fully fleshed out sequels. Definitely tracking this studio to see what they come up with next."

76561198048974498,Recommended,252330,9627599,"Posted: 25 March, 2014",all,rjmacready,"I play a lot of horror games. I mean A LOT. I'm always in search of that thrill which horror MOVIES can rarely give me any more, which means I want a game to SCARE me. Slender: The Arrival is definitely scary. In fact, it's possibly the single scariest game I've ever played. You want to know why? BECAUSE IT CHEATS.Okay, a confession before I go on. I'm seriously beginning to suspect that I'm really BAD at video games. I mean, all that hand-eye coordination and lightning reflexes stuff...it's just not me. I have the reflexes of a snail (a fast and lively snail, perhaps, but a snail regardless), and I can barely even shoot straight in first-person shooters. I'm pretty crap, honestly.So how, you ask, do I manage to complete so many games, some on even the hardest difficulty levels? It's because I'm not afraid to go back to the last save/checkpoint and redo sections a bit better than last time (e.g. waste less ammo and medkits), and I'm smart enough to learn from my mistakes. THAT'S IT. Nothing else. But enough talk of me, and let's get back to this game...Let's start with save/checkpoints. There AREN'T any, basically. You complete a Chapter, and you unlock the next one for future play. But not much of anything DURING said Chapters (of which there are a mere six). Which means if you manage to turn on FIVE out of SIX generators, then DIE, you have to go back to the FIRST generator. I know this is some people's idea of a ""challenge"", but personally, it just infuriates the living Christ out of me. But hey, you know what? Sometimes this style of game design CAN work, up to a point, as long as the player:  a. Doesn't get thrown back a full twenty minutes of gameplay, and b. Can apply what they've learned the last time to a new round of play.Say, for example, in the scenario I've mentioned above, that you can learn WHERE the final generator is, just before you're unceremoniously snuffed. The problem in this game is...THE LOCATIONS OF THE GENERATORS ARE RANDOMLY CHOSEN. Which means that while the game does arguably still have a ""learning curve"" of sorts, such as vaguely getting to know your way around the humungous bloody mine complex, the learning curve is very limited because you still have to stumble around blindly looking for the next blessed generator.So it's the kind of situation where you'll activate three generators the first time you try, four the next time, TWO the time after that, FIVE the time after that and then all the way back to TWO for the, what are we up to, the FIFTH BLOODY TIME?!? In other words, there isn't much of a feeling of PROGRESS, something which I'm afraid I need to feel in ALL aspects of life, or else I just feel like GIVING THE ♥♥♥♥ UP. A well-designed game will make you feel like you're gradually getting CLOSER to conquering the bit which is troubling you, and doesn't give the impression that whether or not you make it through this time is just down to sheer blind LUCK...Which brings us to the next problem with this game. Far from feeling like it's all your own dumb fault when you DO cark it, this game is basically like playing a game of hide-and-seek where your pursuer has a distinct advantage over you, like being able to basically just APPEAR RIGHT NEXT TO YOU when they damned-well feel like it. Not to mention, as each successive generator/note/whatever is found, the stakes are upped, which means that if generator number five is in a confined little room, activating it will in all probability cause your antagonist to immediately appear in doorway of said room, thereby reducing your chances of escaping to precisely ♥♥♥♥-ALL. All because of the sheer, dumb luck of where the generator randomly generated.Sure I could probably try to muster up the courage to carefully stake out the entirety of the mine complex before touching a single generator, but by now my patience is LESS THAN ZERO and I could almost STRANGLE A PUPPY. And besides, I'd probably DIE before I even laid eyes on all six generators, and really, IT'S JUST A ♥♥♥♥ING VIDEO GAME, NOT A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, AND I HAVE OTHER THINGS I'D LIKE TO ACHIEVE WITH MY REAL LIFE BEFORE DYING IN IT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!The bottom line is this: Yes, I seek a decent ""challenge"" in a game, but I'm really not seeking the video game equivalent of banging my head against a brick wall. Or if I do, I want to feel like that wall is gradually crumbling under MY weight, not the other way around.Now, are you ready for the biggest shock of all? I'm about to give this game a RECOMMENDATION. I'm going to recommend it to all the people out there who believe that games SHOULD be stupidly hard, and believe that a game tossing in ""unfair"" random elements to make things harder is a perfectly legitimate way of creating a more ""challenging"" experience (and a good way to make a rather short game somewhat lengthier, I might add).I'm also recommending it to anyone who, like me, enjoys a game which is♥♥♥♥♥♥scary and relentlessly atmospheric (which this is); though I would certainly suggest caution to anyone who requires things like STORY and LOGIC in order to enjoy a game. (To wit: ""Here I am looking for pieces of paper in the woods, for no apparent reason, while some tall demonic being is zipping about trying to kill me...and while I do this, I have a flashlight in one hand and a video camera in the other, the latter seemingly just an attempt to emulate the vastly superior Outlast, in which the video camera WAS the only light source, and the protagonist was at least a journalist willing to risk it all to get a great story, not just some girl looking for her sister in a forest. Which I think is who I am and what I'm doing here. Something like that. To be honest, I forgot about fourteen retries ago..."")No doubt about it, this is definitely one game which will ""frazzle the nerves"", in both a good AND bad way. For now I'm giving up on it, roughly half-way through, even though looking at other people's reviews/criticisms suggests that the Chapter I'm stuck on is by far the HARDEST of all the Chapters, which would imply even more problems with the game's design than I've yet discovered (i.e. dodgy structure and crappy difficulty scaling). Maybe I'll feel the bravery to tackle this one again some day...or maybe I'll just decide to live out the rest of my years without the guilt of being a crazed PUPPY KILLER (see above, about fourteen frustrated paragraphs ago).To anyone who hasn't yet bought this...make sure you buy Outlast first. That's a game which knows how to RESPECT its players, without resorting to heavy-handed, bullying tactics to make sure the experience is indeed a ""scary"" one. So close, yet so far...Verdict: 7/10."

,Recommended,252330,20520131,"Posted: 14 January, 2016",all,Wolf,"Game name: Slender: The ArrivalReviewed by: WolfIn Summary...Slender: The Arrival is a superb horror game made in succession to the popular indie game Slender: The Eight Pages by Mark J. Hadley in 2012. The story follows Lauren, who is investigating a disappearance of her friend Kate, after arriving at her home late one evening to find her missing. Racing through the levels uncovering more clues via pages, the story begins to unravel and you will soon learn Kate's fate. With 8 chapters and a secret level, this game delivers a horrifyingly stunning grasp on the tale of the Slender man.Controls:WASD - move character.Mouse - look around.Left click - interact with objects.Escape - pause.Sounds:Slender: The Arrival is filled with horrifying sounds. If you've played the orginal title, you'll know when Slenderman gets near or is pursuing you, the screen becomes distorted and sharp noises peirce your ears. This can be especially jump-scare worthy in high-pressure moments, such as collecting the pages in Chapter 2, or turning on the generators in Chapter 3. Not only in addition to Slenderman, new characters are added in pursual of Lauren, meaning it's literally twice as scary! (bad pun intended)Graphics:Substantial. If you have the time, feel free to check out the screenshots I've made with this game, they're absolutely phenomenal. I do, however; wish the graphics were supported to double the resolution such as the option in games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter have.Game Balance:It is very easy to win this game. I have played multiple times through, so I've learned which paths to take and how to avoid Slenderman and others in a proficient way. Newcomers may find it more difficult, and if playing on hardcore mode, adds a little bit more of a challenge to the game. Still hoping for a mode beyond hardcore though, preferably a veteran mode of some sorts with more appearances, no lighting, and no sprinting.OtherFix achievements please. Currently there's a bug with the cloud saving, where if you resetstats in console, the game does not reset scrapbook nor steps, and deletes all achievements. This causes you to not be able to obtain the 10k steps achievement or the collector achievements. Easy fix = disable cloud saving. There's literally no need for a single player game like this.Final Rating:8/10In Conclusion:Absolutely a must have for any horror fan or veteran. This game offers a much more enticing tale and rivveting experience than the predecessor, The Eight Pages, as well as a much more stunning visual experience.Please feel free to follow mycuration pagefor more recommendations. Thanks for reading!"

Dont look behind you.Just like outlast, it has a storyline behind it, you collect notes, you collect pages, and you collect alot of other things, Its only you, Slender man, and his proxies, Really good background music for the eight pages part, The *thump thump* noise when you get your first page, but the music escalates with every 2nd page gotten, 3 to 5 to 7, the music gets higher, making you rush to get that final page.Rule number 2. dont go to the house in between pages, like on 3-5 pages^^^ doing that will just get you killed, I dont reccomend going into the building while your on your 3rd 4th or 5th page, I would instead Recommend going there first so thats out of the way. (This should be a guide not a Review LOL)Graphics, and Atmosphere are good, depending on your graphics card, Storyline is somewhat good, but still a good way to get that adrenaline pumping, Slender man popping out of no where (atleast around 10-20 feet in front of you) thus scaring the fudge out of you.10/10 Reccomended!

And while nothing really special, it was pretty fun, atmospheric and scary.Now, this game is basically the Eight Pages on steroids, which is both a good and bad thing...Let's start with positives:1.Game is very atmospheric and it gives you feeling of hopelessness. Since you only have a flashlight and a camera, your only options of defence is running away with your tail between your legs.2.Sound design is pretty good. Wind blowing through trees, camera static, creepy ambient sounds and echoes sound pretty great.3.There is also a new enemy type that you will meet on a few levels, adding some variaty.4.If you are easily scared, you'll probably get your heart and adrenaline a nice little workout.5.Game got some love with patches and some new (and old) levels completely for free, which is niceNow let's go over negatives and man, are there lot's of em:1.Story is basically non existent. You're there to find some boy or a girl, but why, where and when is never really explained, unless you find and read all the collectibles.Even then I had to go to on the internet to get my story fix. I know, it's a ""scary simulator"" but it is such a shame we don't get to know any of the rich lore behind Slenderman or ingame characters.2.If you're into horror games, have played a few, or are not so easily scared - you will get bored pretty quickly. This game relies heavily on jump scares and spooky sound effects, which, while scary at first, will get repetitive pretty quickly3.Difficulty is way to easy on easy (no pun intended) and medium but WAY to unforgiving on hardcore.On medium you're pretty much unstoppable, save for a few spots, but on hardcore some levels are so EXTREMELY annoying and unforgiving, you'll be sent to the retry screen so fast, you'll think that the game has crashed and got stuck on the same screen.Protagonists movement speed is something of the worst I have ever expirienced! Your movement speed is comparable to a turtle and sprint makes no sense at all, since it's completely random... Sometimes when you spot Slenderman, your character will run like a Nascar vehicle on a rampage, but other times (especially when you really need to) you really start to wonder if main protagonist you play as has a death wish or something, since her run speed will be so bad, a toddler would crawl past her while he was asleep...It also doesn't help that the game is just so dark 90% of the time, which lead to...4.This game is so friggin dark... I mean brightness cranked all the way to maximum but still dark - dark!But don't give me flak about that, I know Slender: the Arrival is supposed to be dark and spooky game, which is the point, but I mean really? This games darkness will give a black hole a run for it's money!Even with brightness at maximum, you are blind as a bat without you flashlight. You won't see crap and  it is really frustrating, especially on hardcore, because you flashlight have limited battery.Got 7 out of 8 pages but you flashlight depleted the battery? Might as well restart, since there is no way you'll be seeing anything, except maybe Slendermans buttcheeks rubbed against your face anyways if you're lucky.5.Graphics are pretty terrible, even for a indie game. I mean, most of the game is dark and you won't be seeing much anyways. It still isn't good excuse for this game to look like Half Life 1. Textures looks old, muddy and dated, animations are just... basic, and water, trees and grass will probably make a senior pc enthusiast cry.6.Game have been out for a year now, and it ran pretty terribly back then. Well, 1 year and 3 days later and it still performs somewhat terrible, even after patches...While not nearly as bad as before, on some spots however, this game will really live up to it's predecessors name, the Eight Pages since your top notch gaming beast machine will  cry and sweat  proficiently to spit 8 FPS out of this game7.For me personally, Slender: the Arrival got repetitive pretty quickly. While game started out really great, jumpscares got old and missions became repetitive and just plain boring. But It's hardly a problem though since Slender: the Arrival is so amazingly short...8.Yes, this game is alarmingly short. I mean REALLY, REALLY short. There is even an achivement for completing it in 45 min. Don't worry, it isn't hard since you can easily ace through it in no more than 30 min with some practice.TL;DR and/or conclusion:All in all, Slender: the Arrival is hit & miss. While some people will enjoy it, for me, it got boring really, really quickly.I was hoping for a really scary game with rich lore and lot's of exploration, but what I got was a boring, short, walking simulator with a lot of jump scares, bad graphics, non existent story which was way to easy on normal and way to frustrating and rage indusing on hardcore.My honest opinion?Try it at friends house, get it on sale, or spend your money on something else"

The game gets increasingly frustrating as you get closer to the end, and most of the time spent playing the game is trying to figure out where you are supposed to go, or dealing with enemies that apparently do no damage... I would suggest playing with the classic mouse and keyboard because I had a very hard time with a standard gaming controller; the sensitivity is either too high or two low and learning the controls is a frustrating feat for such a short game. I would not reccomend buying this game UNLESS you are a die hard fan of the original Slender, or if you enjoy scaring your friends.

Sure, Slender : The Arrival looks and plays better than its freeware counterparts but overall it's a disappointing game, especially if you put it next to Amnesia : The Dark Descent, a game that helped the renewal of the horror genre.The first chapter managed to set up effectively a scary mood. Exploring the house and its surrounding was really stressful and made me felt really vulnerable. I always expected the worse. The second chapter is more like a remake of Slender : The Eight Pages. While the scare factor was still there the experience felt repetitive. The third chapter is certainly where the game went downhill. The little child is creepy the first time he jumps at you but after a while it gets repetitive and at the end we don't care anymore. The chapter where the events unravel from someone's else perspective was really surprising but at the same time it was too short. At the end of Chapter 6, we are left with an unexpected but disappointing conclusion. The game just lasted 1h 30min.To summarize, the lack of work on the game design is what hurt Slender the most. Playing the game feels more like walking on an alley of jumpscare than facing dangerous threats.Don't get me wrong. I'm not against the idea of a commercial Slender game. I just wish the game could be more polished since it has so much potential.Hopefully, the next commercial Slender game on PC will get everything right.Rating :5.5 / 10"

Given that I'm writing this review in 2016, I'm going to assume that you aren't. It's weird to look back and think that a faceless guy in a suit had everyone scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ five years ago, but the entire horror genre was in a rut at the time, so I guess that helps explain it.I digress. The game itself is almost exactly two hours long, and does nothing that Amnesia or Outlast don't do better. It can, at times, be more frustrating than scary, since the basic mechanic it operates on is ""look for something while being chased."" In theory, this leads to the player being forced to enter every dark corner, knowing there's a chance what they're looking for might be there. In execution it leads to you running around like a chicken with your head cut off. It doesn't help that Slenderman teleports. A lot of these games rely on spatial awareness, knowing where your enemy is to avoid them, but that's not useful for an enemy that doesn't adhere to time or space. It sometimes feels like the game could kill you at any point if it just felt like it, which, again, is more frustrating.To be fair, other enemies come in that are suspectible to space-time, but these have their own issues. The initial appearance of mask-guy is fun and creepy. But then the game starts pulling in burnt zombie/ghost children, which there really isn't any precedent for in the Slenderman lore. The most annoying part of all this is that at the end of almost every scene in the game, the monster gets you. Which leaves the player wondering: ""Why did I have to retry when it caught me the last five times just so it could catch me in a scripted event?""I will give the game this: while it's only two hours long, it never does the exact same thing twice. Each scene plays by different rules than the others. Which keeps the player confused, yes, but also on their toes.If you still have some affection for Slenderman buried somewhere, this is recommended."

I found his design and behavior to be very intriguing, that was the original reason I picked this game up. I didn't expect too much from it since I had seen a playthrough of it when it first came out, BUT this game has truly stunned me! They added soo many bloody new things to enjoy! New levels, more story, another antagonist, and soo much replay value. I was very surprised at how satisfying the gameplay was, and it did quite a good job of making an erie atmosphere. Now being the manly man I am, I wasn't even scared for a second! But to some people I suppose this game would be considered pretty freaky. So in the end, if you like Slendy and horror games, I would suggest you give this one a go!"

The mystery will draw you in to make you want to learn more about what you are getting yourself into. It sticks to a very basic control scheme anyone can use. You can expect to finish the game in 3 hours of play, but there is decent replay value.1.	Story – 4/10 After fully beating the game once, I was still confused at what I just experienced. You read notes throughout the game which give little pieces of information about what is going on and if you do not collect a large majority of them good luck figuring this story out! I could make some good guesses at what I think the story is, but I could easily be wrong on these also.2.	Difficulty – 4/10 While there is one particular area of the game I thought I might never beat, the rest was relatively easy. In fact the last half of the game I did not get a single game over.3.	Visuals – 7/10 The graphics in this game are decent. If you run the graphics on a higher setting it looks pretty nice and adds a slight touch to the atmosphere which is always appreciated in a horror game. Speaking of visuals, your flashlight will be your best friend in this game. When it is dark, it is DARK!4.	Audio – 9/10 This would have to be the best aspect of this game. If you really want to experience this game play this game with the volume turned up! The game is often quite and subtle which leaves the player feeling on edge as if something is about to jump out at any moment. When the pace picks up a little though, so will the background music. You will often here the antagonist movement long before you see him and in some scenarios hearing a baddie before you see them can be life or death!5.	Replay Value – 7/10 The game is short, but there are pages of plot hidden throughout the game that once you find, are added to a scrapbook you can view at anytime. Items on the map are randomly placed each time, although it does not vary much. This game is also great fun with friends because face it, who doesn’t like to see their friends pee their pants in fright. There are also steam achievements and steam trading cards to be found in this game.6.	Final Verdict – 6/10 The gameplay is very basic, the graphics are decent and the audio excels! The story is very confusing, but does not hinder the scare factor. Playing alone with the volume high is sure to give anyone some good jumps. It is a very short game but I enjoyed it all the way through."

76561197970538611,Recommended,252330,31367388,Posted: 25 April,all,Westenra,"This is the third version of Slender I have played and it really caught me off guard. The first was a demo that consisted solely of the ""8 Pages"" level, which I could not beat for the life of me. The second was a version I downloaded offGoG.com, which ran like absolute garbage. This version is the newest and most stable yet, running like a dream even on the highest settings with my admittedly low-budget graphics card.If you are not familiar with the monster that is Slenderman, well, don't worry, you can still enjoy this quality horror adventure to its full extent. This game got a ton of hate upon release by 2kool4skool pleb-trolls who were fed up with the Slenderman following, labeling it ""shovelware"" because, well, it's fun to hate stuff. Without spoiling too much, Slenderman is a ""Creepypasta"" creation, a.k.a. a Reddit story made up for fun that caught on and inspired an entire mythos of horror fiction, including several fleshed-out YouTube series like ""Marble Hornets"" and ""Tribe Twelve"". Slenderman is a cryptic, extra-dimensional entity that feeds off the energy of children, following them throughout their lives and infecting the timelines of their families and future generations like a supernatural cancer. He has the ability to teleport, and alter the sanity of his victims, up to and including turning them into malevolent slaves. His ultimate motivations are unknown.The game itself is a solid first-person horror adventure, about 5-6 hours long, wherein you play a young woman investigating the disappearance of her best friend. The game-world is littered with high-quality collectibles that flesh out the back story, often vaguely, adding to the creepy and foreboding atmosphere. Levels often contain a commendable day-to-night cycle. In other words, you will start with a sunset and end with pure evening as you progress. The sound design deserves special mention; while the soundtrack is sparse and effective, what is really unnerving is the way everything retreats to an ominous, muted tone when entering interior spaces. You'll know it when you hear it.As far as infusing dread in the player, this is the best game I've ever played. The presentation makes you feel alone, vulnerable and confused. It's never totally clear what is going on, other than you are being baited and hunted. Every new discovery takes you closer to the edge of chaos.It's not without it's flaws, of course. The main character is a woman, but she sounds like a man when she runs. What's up with that? Also, many of the achievements are an unfair test of patience, forcing you to redo certain levels over and over to trigger certain events. Considering there are no saves and death results in a restart, this seems like an intentional middle-finger on the part of the devs.But I digress. If you are looking for an above-average horror game with great presentation and lore, look no farther."

,Recommended,252330,29133154,Posted: 8 January,all,The Daedalian,"StoryIn Slenderman The Arrival you play as Lauren, on her way to visit Kate at her home tucked away in the woods. Upon arrival you find that she is nowhere to be found, in the distance you hear a woman's scream, armed with nothing but a flashlight you head in it's direction. (Arguably a foolish direction to go but hats off to Lauren's ballsy determination) As you progress through each chapter in search of Kate, you will uncover clues and entries that point to darker forces at work than originally thought.GameplayThe Arrival is simple in controls and arguably just a walking simulator, however I don't mean that in a bad way. Each chapter is rather brief but offers a unique environment/atmosphere with clues and entries scattered along the way. Enemy mechanics are rather shallow yet there spawns are random each play-through/death, creating tense moments every time. Glitchy HUD effects add to the scares but at times feel unjustified or ""cheap"" like the games saying ""Alright enough of this running around BS."" Casually simple but certainly scary.SoundsNot entirely notable but definitely chilling. On a rare occasion some sounds clips came across like they didn't fit in the given situation, meaning foot steps when no one was around (Spooky, I know) or rustling leaves that overpowered all other sounds.GraphicsMuch like the sound effects and music, the graphics aren't much to write home about but exceeded my expectations during purchase. Character models and animations are clunky, but when you're gripping your mouse like it's Wonka's last golden ticket and twitch from fright, you tend to let the graphics slide.Replay ValueRandom enemy spawns and objective locations grant more replay value than previous thought. Increasing the difficulty requires a slightly different play-style, but as previous stated Slendermans appearance and HUD glitching feels cheap and at times frustrating.Wrapping UpFreaky and enjoyable. For the price it's a good game that deserves praise for it's ability to scare in what you could argue is a rather casual first person horror."

I found myself getting nervous even after figuring out how to solve a given puzzle, because the atmosphere is very effective.If you like the general atmosphere of Myst, this is basically that with more emphasis on creepy.Replay value is also good because certain items are spawned in different places each time, and certain game events/scares change between plays."

Although it was a bit of a short game as I clocked in around 2.5 hours, completing it in two sessions, I've got no regrets about purchasing or playing the game. It was a good experience I enjoyed, which is what matters. And if I must say so, I was quite a fan of the soundtrack for this game, which I also purchased as well. I find it goes well with the game itself and definitely adds in that scare factor. It can also be creepy as well. I was impressed with the graphics. And controller support was a nice bonus too, as I was initially unsure if this game had it or not.  And finally, I think this game has a pretty good story as well, which is an important thing I look for when I play video games.

The enemies you shall be running from are frightening and very well designed, each with their own unique mechanics and characteristics.Slender: The Arrival has a very simplistic story on the surface, starting with the player character, Lauren, visiting the isolated home of her friend Kate, only to find her missing and sets out in search of her. However, as the game progresses, small and even subliminal clues can reveal the nightmare fuel behind the horrors you witness.Unfortunately, the game was somewhat short upon release, but a healthy dose of extended and new levels from Blue Isle Studios certainly made up for that problem. It is still not as long as games like Outlast, but the various difficulty settings, achievements and small level of randomisation in the levels will always be alluring for those with the courage to go again.Slender: The Arrival is a worthy adaptation of the original Slender: The Eight Pages game and does an excellent job of making you feel as if Slenderman could be right behind you at any time. The tension and atmosphere are exquisite, the story is chilling and the scares are unforgettable. After all this time, I can still not get enough of this game, and can certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror experience."

,Not Recommended,252330,11880520,"Posted: 26 August, 2014",all,Gravelord Azathoth,"*Note: this review was written before the 2.0 update and many issues have now been fixed*This is one of those odd games to review. You see initially i was having an enjoyable experience and wondering why this game got lower scores but now that i look back i see some of the outstanding issues. At the beginning of the game I was pretty freaked out, you know, taking my time looking around every dark corner. This was good, the opening prologue level was probably my favourite part of the experience. But after the end of this level that's when things start to fall down. Slowly as you progress through each level the fear factor actually decreases. With brighter lit enviroments as you progress the game it took away some of the worry that i had since i no longer needed to worry about what was in the dark.(BTW i love darkness in games but when you make it so dark it's impossible to navigate i have an issue) Not only does the scare factor drop with the lighting system but when i first watched the Chaser from a distance i was more laughing than scared since the animation was jerky and the AI seemed to be in a state of pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This strikes me as odd though that an enemy that you will spend a lot of time looking at has crap animation while the Slenderman(the creature you'll want to spend the least time looking at) has proper and well designed animations. The other creature, Charlie, seemed to have near-non existant animations and when he was sitting still it looked more like a something from Doom where it's a 2D images worked into a 3D enviroment.The sound design feels well done with creature and enviroment noises adding to your already tense state. But i stopped for a minute when I heard the sounds from Slender: The Eight Pages. I guess it's supposed to be a callout to the last game but this is a new game and i'd like to hear improved versions of these sounds.Speaking of the last game, I did enjoy the Eight Pages remake level, which did a good job of calling out to the last game while still keeping a sense of originality.Now here's the big one besides the ending, the glitches. Now I only had one real gamebreaking bug but in horror games even if a bug isn't game breaking it can still absolutely ruin the immersion for a player. For example, the first time I played the Eight Pages level I had 7 pages and was freaking out ,worrying about the Slenderman but then I saw him and was baffled when he was about to kill me and then just left. I didn't see him like a retard and walked right into him and ♥♥♥♥ all happened. And I know this isn't supposed to happen since I tested the level other times. Other Slendy bugs were dying from him even though he was nowhere to be seen, him teleporting inside other objects and a weird one where he hovered above the ground. My gamebreaking bug was when I was caught by the Chaser and waited to die but the camera just sat there fixated on the Chaser's face like it had grabbed me. After a few minutes the Chaser started running away with the camera following it's face from the front. This continued for about 7 minutes before i gave up and had to restart the level.We now come to the ending. Now I feel like I could spoil the ending here and not ruin it for you at all but I won't for the sake of fanboys everywhere. What you should know is the ending is a major cliffhanger with nothing being resolved. It just kinda ends. Maybe I could have overlooked this but with the game being obnoxiously short it makes it un-compensatable. It feels like after the ending was actually once a level just a leading to the next level and they were just like, ""♥♥♥♥ it we can sell it like this"" and then just folded in.So all in all,PROS:-Nicely designed enviroments-Atmospheric SFX and music-Very well directed opening-Small enclosed enviroments(buildings, etc...)-Scary and well designed creatures-Interesting secret level-Some genuinly scary momentsCONS:-Embarrasingly short-Buggy creature animation-Poor AI-Massively well lit sections-Repetitive objectives-Too much audio taken from S:EP-Many glitches and bugs-The door opening mechanics-Extremely aggravating to get the secret level-Unsatisfying endingI wish there was a maybe button on Steam because that would suit this perfectly since there are good sequences but it is overall lacking so I'm afraid I can't recommend this unless it's on a decent sale."

Its few and far between scares, lack of clearly visible story, and lack of any additional content. Make Slender the Arrival a tough buy for any fan of trhe origional Slender the Eight Pages fan, and fans of survival horror games in general. Performance wise, the game is a mixed bag, with a quad core i7, 2 gig nVidia GPU, and eight gigabytes of ram. I got between the pitiful realm of around twenty FPS to what felt like about fourty. It is not a welly optomized game. With this in mind, the graphicaql quality of the game, maxed out on my rig, dosen't really meet the current bar for the genere. It's muddy, and lifeless, despite its seemingly large world. I got very few scares out of the game, and finished in about an hour or so, on easy. Raise the difficulty, and the game batters you. Glitches, unfair diffulcty curbs, and an overall bland narrarative. I was looking forward to this game, for some good scares with slightly upgrated visuals.

I'd always heard how supremely creepy the Slender mythos was, and I'd heard good things about the Eight Pages when it was free on the web (though I'd never played it). Alas. Yes, there are a few decent jump scares, but that's about it. Honestly, the most frightening thing about the game is how hot it makes my computer run. I couldn't focus on the prologue because I was too busy wondering if my PC was going to catch fire. In terms of gameplay, there's not much to it. You run around, pick up or turn on things, and try not to die. Funny thing about that, though. Running wears you out pretty fast, or something - I don't know. It's hard to say. You'll be trying to run away from something, and then you're not running fast anymore, and then OH GOD IT'S ON MY FACE. Retry. Retry. Retry. Since key objects are - in most cases - randomly generated around each level, all you can really do is hope they spawn close enough so that you can activate them before whatever thing is after you tries to kill you. Sound like Outlast? It's a lot like Outlast. Except you can't hide from things, and as far as I can tell, turning off your flashlight doesn't dissuade them from running over and clawing your face. Fun! Except not. Also, about that story: you are someone, apparently, wearing a hoodie and recording everything, because found footage, or whatever. And it seems you're trying to find your friend, or something, who apparently is a nut case and likes to draw with chalk on every surface for hours at a time in big scribbly letters. You get hints of something or whatever, but that's about it. Despite a decent score, and a few pretty vistas throughout, this game is really not worth the hour or two it takes to complete it."

,Recommended,252330,9463345,"Posted: 13 March, 2014",all,Shnucks,"Slender: The arrival is a horror game made on the Unity engine that plays around with the Slenderman myth.  If you haven't heard of Slenderman, you must have slept under a rock for a couple of years, since this baddy has been around for a while.The game starts you off as Lauren, a normal, teen-age girl who goes to visit a friend of hers who happens to be in the middle of the woods (Who would've thought).  But, there's a certain, horrifying exception to this friendly greeting.  Slenderman wants to join the party.  Kate, your friend, has gone missing for a while, and as you uncover her secret, you regret every thought about her.For the most part, the game is pretty terrifying.  If you've ever played a Slender game before, you'll get the basics pretty quickly, but some of the scares will probably be less effective towards you.  There are seven levels in total, including an easter egg level that messes with your head, with two more levels to be added at a later date.  Along with the similar controls, you'll find the gameplay to be also very similar to the other Slender games, which is disappointing.  I was hoping that they would add something new or have a new mechanic that's nececessary to play, but most of the levels are usually, ""Collect 8 Pages"", or ""Close all windows and doors"".  It detracts from the experience, but still keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times.Slenderman isn't the only creature that is present.  Characters such as proxies, Slenderman's slaves who were previous victims of the Slenderman, are present in some levels.  Oh, and one thing to point out.  This and Marble Hornets are NOT connected in any way!  People are confusing characters with Masky and Hoody from the youtube channel.  Even though the writers of Marble Hornets are working on this, the stories aren't tied.  Just wanted to get that out.Overall, the game is a terrifying game with some replay value as the scares are always randomized and even sometimes likes to break the fourth wall.+ Vewy Scawey+ Some Replay Value+ New levels Added Occasionally- Repetitive Gameplay8/10: Highly Recommended"
,Recommended,252330,16514531,"Posted: 18 June, 2015",all,GrandMasterian,Slender: The arrival is a fun yet terribly horrible experience. There arent many good horror games these days some examples of some good one are amnesia and outlast amongst others. This game comes at a close top. It has a good mix between tension and jump scares most are well placed and not repeating every 3 seconds. For a short game it gives you a lot of fun moments. It does have some drawbacks as the prive is too high for a game thats 2-3 hours worth of content and has no replay value. It also does come with its fair share of bugs nothing game breaking but you sometimes have to restart the game due to a missing object or getting stuck in a loading screen. I do recommend this game but not at full price pick it up at 50-60 percent off. 7/10 Great game.

If you like either one of those, and a good jumpscare, you'll like this one. The story seemed like a prologue, so hopefully it's just The Arrival and we'll see some fully fleshed out sequels.

Kate keeps having visions of the Slenderman and decides to move out of her house and sell it,which prompts Lauren to investigate and visit since she's a real estate agent. Her car gets stopped by a tree,so Lauren goes to Kate's  house on foot, finding her stuff/furniture all over the place,and drawings of Slenderman all over Kate's room and on the walls. She hears Kate scream and goes out to investigate.  She finds the 8 pages in the forest and is almost kidnapped by the Slenderman and tries to escape,but blacks out.  She then flips on the 6 generators in the Kullman mine,occasionally getting caught by Kate(as a proxy,basically a servant being mind-controlled by Slenderman)and escapes on an elevator.  She finds a tape and sees that Kate was turned into a proxy by Slenderman,she then finds another tape(first DLC level),where CR is investigating what happened to Charlie and gets killed by Charlie,who was also turned into a proxy.  She then goes to the radio tower as Kate's notes instructed her,but the forest bursts into flames and Slenderman occasionally appears,trying to block Lauren's path.  She evades the Slenderman and goes into the radio tower,where she finds a tape,plays it in the camera that's sitting next to CR's charred corpse,which reveals how CR was killed(won't spoil how tho). Charlie(as a proxy)runs up to Lauren and she blacks out.  She ends up in a destroyed-looking home,and after looking at a couple of notes(from Kate I'm not sure myself),hears crying.  She goes to investigate the crying,which turns out to be Kate,and Kate kills her,and the camera shows  Lauren being dragged offscreen(by I believe Slenderman,again not sure myself),and the camera shuts off,ending the game.In addition to the main story there's also 2 DLC levels(including the one I mentioned with CR,the other one I won't spoil),and a level called""Genesis"",which is a remake of the game that started it all,The Eight Pages :)The music is amazing,tho the game mainly relies on ambiance and atmosphere.The characters are pretty good,and the voice acting as well(tho there's not a whole lot of actual voice acting).The levels are really cool,tho they can get kind of repetitive with the gameplay at times I'll admit(even as a huge fan of this game)The atmosphere is probably the best part of the game(in my opinion at least), and I can guarantee that at least 1 time you'll get scared,brave with horror games or not(in fact,I actually cried once because I was so scared xD).Overall,this game is an amazing horror game that I recommend to everyone,and I applaud Mark Hadley and Parsec Productions for making this game,and Marc Steene for making Slenderman's Shadow,seriously I do :)10/10 from me :)UPDATE Oct. 18,2014: Just got the game on Xbox 360UPDATE May 23,2015: Got a pretty much near-perfect Any% speedrun,and also a near-perfect All Levels speedrun in early Jan.(just forgot to post about it on this review)"

The game is pretty great but it's criminally short with an unsatisfying ending. Personally it is pretty scary to me, I feel like anyone who wasn't scared at least once is a liar or is tough as nails. the only parts where I got stuck is the vhs part (because of the game not registering myself beating the first video) and parts where it is literally too dark to see what to do. the story itself ties in well with the first game but is also unique in its own right, slenderman is pretty spoopy especially when you're just starting to notice him in the background and he then disappears from sight. the first time he disappeared I was 100% sure he was behind me waiting for a jumpscare but strangely enough the game is pretty restrained for the first couple of minutes, it reels you in with the back-story and the mysterious disappearances. through the hidden level, it's implied that Charlie Matheson (the boy on the lost poster) is, more or less, the slenderman himself though this somewhat contradicts the optional level ""memories."" though this could actually imply through the ending of memories, not that he was killed by slenderman but somewhat acquired by the powers of the slenderman, it is also possible he becomes one of the proxies which could explain their ability to be seemingly everywhere and the fact that one of the proxies appears only after you pick up a train set and a rather familiar stuffed bear. That’s what makes this game interesting and fresh, not just the haunting, yet beautiful visuals, or the interesting story, or the homage’s to series like marble hornets and everyman hybrid, or even the ""scary"" internet slenderman, it's the amount of unanswered questions to be debated. i really hope for 10 or 15 dollars or whatever it is you give this game a spin, maybe if it's on sale and you're interested. This kind of game will simply keep you looking over your shoulders and the tree topped hills for weeks to come, looking for that mysterious, faceless man.Also as a side note, ♥♥♥♥ that cellar and give me back my twenty dollars spooperman."

Not much about the mythology is ever properly explained, and without prior knowledge of it you only get half of the experience out of the game.Sure, it’s a slow moving walking sim with some repetitive item hunts and cheap jump scares. But the real horror here comes from the atmosphere, you can never shake the feeling that whatever you do is empty gestures - the Slender Man is already planted in the mind of the protagonist and escape according to the mythos will be impossible. That underlying desperation and hopelessness is what makes the real horror here, not the jump scares.This is something that the game does very well in presenting with its empty and desolate yet beautiful settings, some fantastic lightning effects and of course the nail biting soundtrack. It’s not often you get a horror game where walking in a beautiful sunset feels like an unavoidable death sentence.There are some tedious parts though, especially the second chapter that is a remake of the original freeware title, due to the large size of the map and randomization of the item locations it can take forever to complete. There are only two of these big maps though and when you are past them some of the truly great chapters await.It’s an experience very much recommended for anyone crying from anxiety when watching the Marble Hornets series.Others may not be as forgiving to the uneven quality of the chapters or the cheap way the story is presented through scattered notes, but as a fan of the mythos it's one of the best walking sim horrors you can find."

The story of Slender, or Slender Man to be precise, was originally an internet phenomenon that had people grasping for the story of this illusive Slender Man that has been ""found"" in writings, pictures, and videos. People have collectively created or contributed to a character of horror through the internet by way of social networks, YouTube and word-of-mouth. S:TA is the next medium in the mythos of Slender Man as it allows you to explore a world where Slender Man exists. You're objective is to uncover the story, piece it together and above all, survive! This game is very atmosphere and has a great level of detail for an Indie game so dive in and let yourself be taken by Slender.

Almost everything in this game pisses me off to no end, and made me angry that I wasted 10 bucks on this awful ""horror"" game.THE GOODThere are a few good things about this game. One is the graphics. The graphics, while unimpressive in the lower settings, looks GREAT in the higher settings. The best parts of the game were walking around in the lit areas, exploring the forest at your own pase, as slender does not appear in these sections. It is a shame that they are very short. The last thing I like is the is the very first level in kate's house. You start out in the sunset, walking to an abandoned house as the sun slowly goes down. Once you get in the house, it's pitch black. You then find a flashlight, and can explore the house as much as you like. One of the rooms is locked and once opened, causes a great scare involving the slender man watching you explore the room outside from the window. Its a very creepy opening and makes a great first impression. Shame the other levels were not like this...THE BADHere's the fun part. Lets start out with it the biggest flaw that will ruin every horror game. IT IS NOT SCARY AT ALL.all the game consists of are cheap, and I mean CHEAP jumps scares that did not startle me at all. Now let me explain something: Jump scares can be well made. If the game uses the features and mechanics found in the game to make the jump scare, it can be done extremely well. Great examples are: Resident Evil 1-4, Outlast, and SCP containment breach. This game however, does not do that and goes for the cheap jump scares found in most♥♥♥♥♥♥horror movies like Insidious and the new Paranormal Activity movies. Another thing I hate is the gameplay.  I could explain it to you but ill just summarize the games objectives for you. In the second level, guess what you have to do? Get 8 pages. In the third level, guess what you have to do? Turn on 6 generators in a large map. In the fourth level, guess what's next? YOU HAVE TO CLOSE 8 DOORS AND WINDOWS!!! Its just the same task over and over and got boring very quick. now lets talk about difficulty. This game is hard. But not the good kind of hard that tests your skills or anything, Im talking about INSANELY cheap deaths. There are times were a character who is not slender man (whom I cannot say the name of as that would be spoilers) chases after you and jumps on you, leaving you limping for a few seconds. But sometimes out of the blue, SHE WILL KILL YOU WHEN SHE JUMPS ON YOU! There's nothing that tells you ""Hey, your going to die if you get attacked again"" and  also, you do not have a certain amount of times you can be attacked, believe me, I tested it. The same applys for the slenderman himself. Sometimes he will appear and give you a chance to escape, or sometimes he will say ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and insta-kill you. This is extremely frustrating in the final level where he appears right in front of you, making you either barley come out alive, or escape, but to then be insta-killed by his damn tentacles. Finally, the game is very short. wanna know EXACTLY how long it took me to beat this game? 58 MINUTES. Sure, my recorded hours say 2, but that is only because I spent a hour testing the games settings to see which would run best on my laptop. While I was happy as this experience was over very fast, its bad for the people who somehow enjoy it, as there game will be over in a flash.THE VERDICTThis game is honestly, the worst horror game I have ever played. Don't even buy it on sale, unless you somehow get it for free, or get it gifted from a friend,it is not worth a penny. 2.5/10 AVOID AT ALL COST!For more reviews, go to our true reviewersgroup:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereviewI apologize for most of the poor gramar found in this review.Also, lets face it, the only reason this game is popular is becuase that retard Pewdiepie lets plays the slender games 24/7."

Even on easy difficulty. I am a kind of person who do not remember roads easily and how chapter 3 level is made like a maze with two enemies who run much faster than you do doesn't help it.Overall it was a very frustrating experience for me rather than scary.

It's still cumbersome to navigate the maps and find the clues though, so if you are easily frustrated with that like me; be prepared.The controls and graphics are definitely the best part; the maps are brilliant in color and lighting which really sets the mood and creates a fear factor.I'd pay $10; usually on sale for $2 which is a steal!Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

The atmosphere of the game is what makes it really good and the lurking enemies can be quite a challenge. i had to set it to easy to make it through getting the eight pages.

I was actually able to follow the story even with being distracted by my stream since I streamed the whole 4.2 hours I currently have on it.I was able to jump right into it and understand it and enjoy it, so that's a plus for a simple minded person like me. xDRatings:Gameplay: 4/5 (I would have to say 4/5 because it was an amazing story but short lived game! I really hope that they make more since it is titled ""The Arrival"", but who knows! Still great gameplay though!)Graphics: 4/5 (Putting this game on top quality makes it beautiful, sometimes at night with the flashlight things look a bit funky but not enough to affect the score greatly. Slender and Charlie definitely had me running away with how good they looked.)Storyline: 5/5 (I personally really enjoyed the story and I was able to keep up with it. It immersed you in every part of the story to so you could either relive it or create it. For such a short timed game, it was definitely a good story keeping in mind it incorporates Slender.)Sp00ki level: 5/5 (I'm easily scared but I would still even give it a 5/5 because Charlie is VERY spooki when you're trying to do stuff and he comes and screams in your face. Slender is a little unfair and unkind at some points, he wouldn't even square up and fight me... BUT oh well. All the characters are definitely spooky and will rustle your jimmies.)"

(In fact, it was encountering Chapter 'Genesis' which so far has basically just been the Eight Pages level copy-pasted that spurred me to write this review)2- Slenderman himself: I know what people find scarey is subjective and one person's horror is another's comedy but it's very hard to be frightened by Slenderman abducting me and assaulting me with bad picture quality when he's done it over 50 times, the saying 'familiarity breeds contempt' comes into play here and this ties into my previous point about repetition. Dying instantly due to a shadowy figure snatching you from the aether and dragging you to parts unknown never to be seen again is terrifying, having it happen to you ad nauseam just makes the experience tedious since it translates what should be a frightening experience (""Oh my God, he's going to get me! Please don't hurt me!"") into something more akin to frustration (""Great, I have to do this all over again, I give up""), the forest fire level (not a spoiler if it's in the achievements) epitomises this concept and was a point where I just gave up on the game for a while because of how annoying and tedious it was becoming.Overall, if you loved the Eight Pages or the Slenderman mythos in general (particularly Marble Hornets) then you will love this game and will enjoy it greatly for those reasons, if not or if you're unsure then this game's repetitive gameplay and design will probably turn it into a seemingly long and pointless struggle with little payoff (with the exception of one or two levels which deviate from the Eight Pages formula and are all the better for it, the reccording on the VCR being a prime example of this).It could be fun but it's hard to give an overall reccomendation."

Finally, a Slenderman game with an actual story other then some random chick gathering pages. Slenderman himself looks amazing in this game, (The only complaint I have is that the tendrils are lacking in their appearence.) and also, he's not the only one you deal with. The effects of coming into contact with the Slenderman are intense, much so that if you're not even expecting it, could rip you out of your seat instantly. You CAN get trapped. Slenderman does more then just teleport. Though, I do give this game a definite thumbs up, there is room for improvement. Falling through floors, Slenderman freezing in place and ruining cutscenes... there's some mishaps. But over all, definitely give this game a try.

The bloom effects and lighting are quite nice. I will say that the character model shadows are pretty pixelated, and the ground seems very low-res, but otherwise it's a terrific looking game.Seems like there is controller support, but for some reason mine wouldn't work (Xbox 360 controller for Windows).

Comparing it to this is like comparing how a Bike to a car. So there is some hardcore difference! it is exciting that the original developer got to bring this title to reality & sell it on steam.I was little bit disappointed with the result, but kind of was not expecting much.... so here is my review. enjoyVisualsWere great, the outdoors had a very beautiful feel/look.  but Indoor environments the textures were extremely buggy. With low res images and lack of detail in geometry. The problem with first person games is that you are going to see the environments up close… technically meaning that attention to detail is important.But with Slender: The Arrival it heavily lacked the amount of polish and overall looked a slighty improved version of the prototype. (Talking about Gameplay/feel, not the features they added ontop)GameplayAt its core, it has extremely simple easy to follow gameplay. There are at times when you wish there was alittle more. But overall it pulls it off.Replay ability?Not really that much, the game is really empty at its core once you have completed it. Nothing really new you could gain by playing it again. The only thing is if you wanted to get all the achivements. But even that is a feels like a grind/chore when you have nothing new to keep your interest.Final thoughtsThe game is a fantastic achievement, however I don't really think i can justify it as a finished game. Gameplay and mechanics... Yes that is finished. But lacking a good solid art direction in the indoor sections hinders my decision on it been finished. (ie: less repeating assets, less pixelated textures, more detail in the Architecture structure of the buildings.(for example in the mine). as there really was no story to tell in that environement that you could see. It was dull uninteresting environement with typical random decal textures of Graffiti  sprayed everywhere. and repeating assets, no evidence  what so ever of who lived/worked here before. it seemed the developer simply duplicated assets around the level and rotating them around a bit. without thought of level design from the players perspective.If you do end up getting this game. I guarantee you will get a fright out of it during some point of gameplay however you will eventually see the small holes that shine through that strip it the title of a ‘AMAZING game’ but rather calling it a good game.Thank you."

,Not Recommended,252330,13605056,"Posted: 25 December, 2014",all,Hopesick,"There's a common complaint among fans of horror video games that very few of the titles in the genre have any real subtlety anymore. It's hard not to agree after having played such games as Dead Space or any recent Silent Hill game. Slender: The Arrival at least attemps to reverse that trend by waiting until around the twenty-minute mark to actually show the eponymous character on screen. Even so, The Arrival is little more than an amalgamation of boring horror cliches that do very little to actually frighten the player once they've figured out the game's basic mechanics.The main premise of Slender is that you are a guy... or a girl... looking for someone named Katie. It's not exactly very big on the details, and I guess the developers wanted to leave those up to the player so that they wouldn't have to go through the trouble of writing an actual plot. The player spends most of the game wandering through a forest that's roughtly the size of an average high school auditorium looking for ""clues"" that look more like the drawings of a troubled 9-year-old who thinks he's ""so hardcore"". All the while being pursued by some faceless guy in a suit that was likely ripped off from Agent 47.Let me step away from the idiotic premise for a moment, so that I can harp on how technically unimpressive the game is. Notwithstanding the fact that it's only $3 on sale (honestly, it's not even worth that much). The Arrival looks like just another generic ""indie"" game that was developed by a team of college kids in their mothers' basement. The lighting is godawful; the player's flashlight is the only light source that actually illuminates the surrounding area. Aside from the player character's head bobbing back and forth, there is no animation to speak of. Slenderman appears out of view and causes some cheap distortion in the player's view. That's it. Nothing else. Even the game's indie credentials don't absolve it from the fact that it was obviously developed on a shoestring budget by a bunch of people who have no idea what they're doing. The ""soundtrack"" consists of a handful of boring ambient tracks that try desperately to create a tense and oppressive atmosphere, but manage to fail at both, only serving to exacerbate just how boring the game actually is.Aside from all of that, between the bad lighting, poor level design, and sparse information, the game's main objective is too difficult, and the game itself too uninteresting to inspire the player to rise to the challenge. If you have a friend or family member who is into Slenderman and also under the age of twelve, this might be a worthwhile purchase. Otherwise, don't even bother, just stick to Marble Hornets."

BEAUTIFUL graphics with such simple details. You view the world through a video camera in a 'Blair Witch Project' atmosphere.The environments are stunning during the day; a beautiful forest in what looks like upstate California with fall leaves, sunlight filtering through the branches and lensflares on your camera. But then at night, the beauty is tarnished as you're alone and hunted in an ebony black wasteland of wood, isolated and with nothing but a flashlight to protect you.Slender isn't the ONLY one after you in this game either...A bit of a scavenger-hunt game with find-it tasks, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Shop around and buy it for cheap so you can at least experience once of the original gems of indie horror games.What does make this game interesting is the story, but sadly the revelation of the story is ruined by obvious jump scares, chase scenes, deaths, and whole-level reloads. It's frustrating that such a deep story (which allows for a fair amount of interpretation as you try to work out 'what happened?' and is predicated on hints of folklore, generational sacrifice, and community paranoia) is hampered by the mechanism for how the story is told.I get that this is one of the hallmarks of the gameplay (collecting pages) - but the problem is that you don't feel you really have the luxury, time, or ability to really hunt for and find the pages in order to fully experience the story. Instead you're constantly running away from something, and hoping you didn't miss a key page or note or story item.On their own, these two methods of horror games are great (slow burn of a complex, psychological story and being chased by scary things), but mixed together in the way it was in this game just makes it annoying and frustrating. I wanted to learn more about the story...but bloody Slender Man and the Chaser and others kept getting in my way, leading me to just enabling god mode so I could least enjoy what parts of the story I was able to piece together.It looks like Blue Isle learned a lot from this game, and Valley is an example of a great game based on collecting background notes that form a story - obviously it's not a horror game and so they've removed the jump scares and death chases but it's a better example now of the studio's excellence at forming a narrative tied to gameplay in a logical sense."

With players viewing the action through Lauren's video camera, the game is at first deeply atmospheric but flaws that hinder the experience soon become apparent.The majority of Slender: The Arrival involves the player walking through dark, open environments where the Slender Man can appear from anywhere. On a first playthrough, Slender: The Arrival is very tense, with each step forward making the player feel uneasy. The overall atmosphere is bleak with finely presented environments, eerie music and collectible notes helping construct an unsettling experience. Players familiar with Slender Man lore will undoubtedly find the experience more unnerving than those who are not.Despite the rich atmosphere and tangible tension, Slender: The Arrival turns into a trivial, almost dull game once the Slender Man actually appears. The first time a player observes the Slender Man, their inital response is most likely one of fright. However, each time the Slender Man appears on screen, the frightning effect is diminished. Players will soon realise that the game consists of a foe that can teleport around the environment to provide cheap jump scares and little more. It soon becomes tedious and if one were to turn around and see the Slender Man merely floating toward them as if it were on a wire, it all becomes easily managable.Slender: The Arrival is good during the first hour but it soon becomes a tedious collection of jump scares which fail to fright and interactions with a folkloreish entity that strips away all creditable mystery or menace. Even harder difficulty settings fail to improve the frights in a lacklustre horror experience."

It was a fresh idea, but it wasn't exactly compelling or fleshed-out enough to warrant spending any more than 30 minutes to an hour with it.Slender: The Arrival aims to lenghten, and provide greater context to the original idea, but it hardly manages to do either successfully.The story is presented to the player through signs and notes that are scattered around each environment in the game, and its your job to collect them and determine what happened in Slenderman Land. Who (or what) is Slenderman? What happened to the family who lived there? Who are they, and why is Slenderman targeting them? The game definitely raises more questions than it answers, so be prepared for dissapointment if you were expecting a decent payoff. Even if you do manage to piece it together, the story is textbook horror, and it doesn't offer any significant surprises or revelations.The game is dissapointingly short as well, clocking in at 2 hours or less on normal difficulty, depending on how often you need to retry the difficult sections of the game.If you go into to Slenderman: The Arrival with low expectations, you might find it enjoyable. The visuals look nice, and the audio design is suitably creepy when it needs to be. In all honesty, it's impressive when you consider that this is Blue Isle Stuidio's first game, but at the end of the day though, Slenderman: The Arrival is undone by its cryptic storytelling and ridiculously short length. I'd only recommend that you pick it up when it goes on sale."

,Recommended,252330,22777076,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,Ænima,"Slender: The Arrival was developed by Blue Isle Studios in collaboration with Mark J Hadley, the developer of the original Slender the Eight Pages in 2012. The Arrival is an excellent psychological and atmospheric, story driven horror game in which the player takes on the role of Lauren, who is investigating the disappearance of her friend. As well as facing new enemies such as Slender Man's Proxy, the player can immerse themselves in an all-new, unique and innovative storyline. Players are introduced to a 'scrapbook' feature in which they can view the collectibles that they are able to find throughout the game. The Arrival is a truly interactive and immersive experience. Players will also be rewarded with longer gameplay, stunning visuals and a soundtrack equally as beautiful as it is terrifying and tense. Fans of the original Slender game are presented with a remake of The Eight Pages. Chapter 9 'Genesis' contains all the original landmarks and page locations from the 2012 game, the only difference is that of much improved graphics and lighting for a greater gameplay experience. I recommend this game to all fans of horror whether they be new or familiar with the genre. A must have; 10/10[NOTE: CHAPTER 9 'GENESIS' IS NOT PART OF THE 'SLENDER THE ARRIVAL' STORY LINE, IT IS JUST A REMAKE OF 'THE EIGHT PAGES' FOR FANS TO ENJOY!]"

It's all words on the screen.-The player switches between two or three different characters throughout the course of the entire game. You don't really know which one you're playing unless you've paid attention (especially in the secret level).-The Chaser's identity is not revealed until the end of the game, and the identity of the monster that kidnaps you (Charlie Matheson Jr. from the posters) is not revealed ever.-The Chaser is not a threatening enemy, if you know what you're doing. She's just tedious and annoying.-The Hardcore Ending is a complete rip-off.-The flashlight and key in the prologue are in different places in the beginning of the game every time. Sometimes, I couldn't find one or the other.BOTTOM LINE:The game has it's flaws, but is all around an acceptable horror game, and I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a good atmospheric horror.

,Recommended,252330,8937438,"Posted: 1 February, 2014",all,Tyler,"As a large fan of horror games, I have a huge problem with them. Most horror games rely on the initial shock of whatever it is you're dealing with. In this case, the whatever it is you're dealing with is Slender Man. He's creepy and extremely startling. He'll scare you to death the first run through this game. Slender, or better yet the mechanics that make up Slender, rely on the unknown and the confusion that's conjured in your own head. Being lost AND hunted make for a stressful situation. And they only lay it on thicker as you continue. But after the first playthrough, you know exactly what to expect and you know exactly how Slender and his hooded companion are going to react to you and your actions. The shock wears off and you're left only a little startled every time your camera lense gets a bit of static. All of that boils down to the lack of any real replayability. Nothing is left to keep you wondering except a few collectables. If you are looking for story in this game, almost the entire narrative is found within the many collectables found in the game. The collectables and the narrative found within those collectables adds a very miniscule amount of replayability. Which brings me to my conclusion; I think this game is very worthy of its $9.99 price tag, but doesn't have much more to offer after the experience."

The story of Kate the Chaser is one of my favorites, and I'm not actually sure if it's been fully solved, I even had some trouble with that one.I've seen a lot of people mistaking Kate for Jeff the Killer. That's uh, cute. Jeff is mentioned nowhere in the game, the only Creepypastas in Slender: The Arrival are Slenderman himself, Kate the Chaser, and Charlie.Now to review the game itself. Is it scary? Not to me, but then again, I'm not scared easily, and this game is pretty old anyway, so the scare factor and fandom has died down a lot. This game has a great story, and this makes a great follow-up to Slender: The Eight Pages, which is also a part of Kate's story. I find this game to be amazingly challenging though, at least when you actually meet Kate as an antagonist, and you have to deal with her AND Slenderman. I also really like the music to this game, it's a bit depressing, but it fits the game. If you're looking for something with a good mystery, and you like Creepypasta, then this game is for you. I highly recommend it.9/10."

Occasionally you have to avoid an enemy such as Slender Man, but this doesn't make up for the lack of actual gameplay. And the plot isn't that great either. Don't waste your money."

I had the chicken skin going and everything.But as  a gamer with ADHD, this really is a challenge.It should feature a god dam RUN button.. Walking is really time consuming and I find that I was losing attention quickly.Especiall when you die and restart. That is just torture in itself.But the run feature as well to avoid confrontations. Seriously, in real life, one would run away from danger. But this character when you confront danger, you still just ""walk away"" like tomorrow is another day.As for defence... Well there is nothing you can do, you get attacked and you are dead. Simple.Would be cool to have something. This would probably be a better game as a fps game.I know that it's not designed to be that way. Just a suggestion or a mod added to it would make this more fun to play like Alien VS Predator 2...Also, achievements. Gaming companies need to stop making achivements like completed NIGHTMARE level. Not everyone can do it and don't want to do it. The fact that you finish the (any) game is and achievement. Sometimes, a person wants to play the game once and that's it they move on. Achievements like this is just making people play the game again for nothing on a level they don't want.Also achievements where you need to see how you die, or fail x amount of times and what not. That is really annoying. It seems they lacked imagination and focused on how to get achievements for playing bad instead of playing well.Although these are what I believe would make it a better game, it is designed for what it is and if you have the patience for it then this game is good for a good scare."

76561198067964464,Recommended,252330,23759509,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,cmaexi,"When Slender: The Eight Pages was released in the summer of 2012, horror fans praised its short, experimental, and completely free take on the genre. Manically dashing through the forest and trying to snag all eight pieces of paper before the creepy Slender Man finds you remains a surprisingly unnerving experience. Cut to spring of 2013, and we now have Slender: The Arrival on PC. This paid-for sequel attempts to pump up the horror experiment into a bigger (though still quite short) game, but it quickly becomes apparent that the simple mechanics of the original Slender crumble under the weight.Most importantly, The Arrival remembers that the core of any good horror lies in its boogeyman. The Slender Man himself still stalks you with the same terrifying persistence he has in the original, exuding a menacing presence that evolves throughout the story in some unexpected ways. Though his iconic design may be simple, I still got freaked out every time I spotted his silhouette in the distance. You can't fight him, only run from him, and that in of itself makes him more frightening than most game monsters.The world he haunts is larger and denser, as well. Instead of a dark forest, you’ll wander through abandoned homes, creepy mines, and sunbaked hillsides. Some of the better-lit areas look genuinely great. Trekking through autumnal forests and rummaging through homes that actually feel lived in make the world of Slender an interesting environment.Some impressive sound design surrounds you with an ambient soundtrack and jarring noises, and it really adds to the already creepy atmosphere. Boards creak, children whisper, and there are some truly terrifying moments that wouldn’t exist without the impeccable use of audio. Like all great horror games, Slender is best served in a dark room with a pair of headphones.These parts, at least, are done pretty well... but it's simply not enough. While I appreciate the lengths that developer Blue Isle went to flesh things out, The Arrival relies far too heavily on the rudimentary game mechanics of the original, which was only ever meant to last for a few minutes. Like its predecessor, the vast majority of The Arrival essentially boils down to finding a certain number of objects while an increasingly dangerous enemy stalks you. Whether it’s pieces of paper in a forest or generators in a mine, you’re repeating the exact same actions in every part of The Arrival. It feels like being asked to finish a Where’s Waldo book while your house burns down around you.The fact that I got tired of it during a game this short shows just how repetitive The Arrival is. While a lucky player can dash through in about 20 minutes, it’ll probably take most people a few hours thanks to the unfair nature of the enemies. Slender Man and his minions don’t mind warping directly behind you and causing instant game over. The worst offender of this comes once you reach the abandoned mine and are introduced to a second enemy type. The Proxy, a creepy knife-wielding kid, stalks you throughout the level as you (yup, you guessed it) once again attempt to find a series of objects. He continually killed me with no warning whatsoever, which as you might imagine, gets pretty frustrating.Although the mine level was genuinely spooky at first, it and many other areas quickly lose their terrifying charm once you’re forced to replay them dozens of times. I appreciate games that are tough yet fair, but those that arbitrarily punish their players sabotage their own fun. This problem persists throughout Slender: The Arrival. The horrifying atmosphere that Blue Isle manages to create is consistently squandered by dull mechanics and unfair difficulty spikes.The VerdictSlender: The Arrival manages to deliver some truly impressive scares, but you’ll have to wade through the muck of repetitive tasks and unfair enemies in order to experience them. I found more enjoyment in playing the free original installment, which delivers a powerful horror experience without the annoyances and filler. By trying to stretch the initial concept over five separate scenarios, Slender only succeeds in proving that some ideas are better left in the experimental phase.~cmaexi 24.06.2016"

It has a few good scares and the whole concept of a supernatural entity stalking you is very interesting, however, game lacks depth. There are also some irritating difficulty spikes and the game is simply unfair in some instances. Few levels are memorable and to the game credit creepy as hell, unfortunately tyhe game seems a little bit too short and extra content is nowhere to be seen so far.Overall Slender the Arrival is a mediocre game, which relies too much on oversimplified game mechanics combined with creepy atmosphere. On the plus side music is great, and ambient sounds are perfect at creating tension, however, there are better games fo play so save your money or wait for extra content to be added or a discount price."

But, there are two things I don't like about this game. 1: The antagonists are easy to avoid. All you have to do is turn and run, or flash a light in their face. A horror game needs scary. Scary is made by scary antagonists in their meth lab of scary. Scary antagonists are hard to avoid. Slender is not. 2: There is a really short story. I finished this game in about 30 minutes. Sure, it does leave a lot of mystery, but there is a limit on how much mystery you can have. Too much mystery leads to confusion. Confusion doesn't sell.Overall, this game may leave you up all night, curling up on the floor, and crying into your carpet, but I still give it a 6.5/10.0"

Its not ALL jump scares like some people might say, but they are a bit more common at some parts than I'd like.I'll give it a recommendation, but only if its at a discount. The game game only lasts about 4 hours. If you want to try to get 100%, look for the secrets, or speed run it, then you might be able to get another hour or two I guess.

The soundtrack did a very good job of immersing me into the game and the ambient noise from the scraping to the water droplets was well implemented and complimented the atmosphere that the various areas had.

One chapter its 8/8 pages, the other one you have to turn on 6/6 generators, another one you have to close 8/8 windows. The ""monsters"" don't look scary at all and the game becomes increasingly worse after the interesting prologue. Many things are left unexplained. For instance how much chalk the woman writing the notes must have used, writing her thoughts all over the place. And I mean LITERALLY ALL OVER THE PLACE. Is the protagonist going crazy? Is the stuff real? Why is there another ""monster"" and is it who I suspect it is. And lastly and most importantly: Do I even care? I think not."

Some of the levels appeared to be a little bit randomly generated.  The enviroments were good for an indie game but I did feel that ""getting lost"" was a part of the gameplay but it was also a bit annoying during a fire level.Overall though it was a bit easy the first play through, a little over an hour even with pauses/retry ect.  It did have a couple of cheesy parts that were goofy and not scary.I'd recommend for anyone looking to play a small horror game in place of a horror movie.

I finally decided to pick this game up after a last years Halloween sale. Right from the start there is ofcourse improvements. The graphics and level design are good, it sets the mood very quick. By starting to play this game most of you probably know the story about how the Slender man works. This is what scared me the most. The constant feeling of having someone nearby and following you. Helping with this is the music who sets a dark and hectic tone. It will smack you in the face without any regrets and the jump scares will be in your face when you least want it. If you are in for a quick and fun enough scare for a weekend you may grab this with your friends of you are too chicken to play it on your own.If you want a taste of the game or want to see the whole game being played you can watch my playthrough how far you want at:http://www.twitch.tv/ecksdeegaming/c/3934822As a plain horror experience, I give this 8/10As a regular game, I give this a 6/10"

The mechanics of the game are fairly shallow and it really has almost no replayability, once you know the scares and story, but it is definitely worth the single ride.

You will almost certainly♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants in fear. 10/10 Too scared to play past part 1Let's paint a beautiful picture for the people.  You're 1987 Volvo is driving down a wooded road on the Appalachian Trail (Or somewhere along the lines of that), when all of the sudden your car loses control and slides into a tree.  Your phone isn't getting any reception and there's no other cars or buildings in sight.  You know your friend Kate's house is right down the road and so you make your way down the dusty pebbled pathway. Down this longwinded path you notice a long brick fence, and contemplate: just who exactly can afford such a fence, and who exactly are they trying to block out? For there is no other houses or population for that matter in sight.  Regardless, you wonder down this road and find a 1998 Range Rover abandoned on the path and make nothing of it whatsoever, because the only people that own Range Rover's are divorcees who ran off with their lawyers. I'm getting carried away now.You reach the end of the path and see Kate's house (Her mother's in reality) and in a remarkable 5 seconds it goes from day to night and you nonchalantly carry on with your way into her house.  It's dark, the bass is heavy and there are scribbles of trees and Slender himself on the wall.  You wonder around this dark and lustrous house in search of clues and wonder just where your friend Kate is.  Among further investigation you notice a pamphlet from Kate's mother's funeral service, as well as a letter (clue 2) talking about how weird things have been happening around the house lately and they aren't really explainable.From there, you head outback after covering everything in the house and you'll find another clue (not disclosing its location) and off you are into the woods to help find Kate."

Then about a year later, i buy the game for myself and i decide to go through it to you know, get some scares out of it, and I didn't realise how much had been added to the game since! The game is now a LOT better to play through and is a lot more story based around the slender games which I think they finally did a good job with.

The Arrival gives a very immersive story, leaving you with questions that make you dig deeper into its lore. Lots of gameplay packed with jumpscares and unsuspecting moments that will end in cringing and death. The game is manageably difficult and fun to play at night. The replay value is there, as different difficulty options leave you to play in different ways to survive. Even the original Slender mini game that every child clammered to play when it first came out is included and the nostalgia is still there."

There was never really a GREAT Slender game, but there was also never really a terrible Slender game. Slender: The Arrival is Parsec Production's (the original creator of Slender: The Eight Pages) first attempt at a story-driven horror game. Let me say, it's definitely an experience.The story's introduction is kinda slow, but the game's pretty so its no big deal. Your friend, Kate, has been missing. You travel to her house in the middle of the forest, and when you get there, the doors are open and the house is a mess. After finding clues and her room key, you see that Kate was terrorized by something for quite some time. Obviously, there's a TON more to the story, missing children, looking for pages (of course), and you even get to play as Kate for a mission.These missions aren't always ""Collect 8 Pages"". Sometimes it's just looking for clues, other times you have to start generators, but I won't spoil any more.Slender: The Arrival is a spot on attempt at a horror game. I pooped myself and jumped out of my seat a couple times, and I can't wait to see what else Parsec Productions and Blue Isle have for this game or the series.9/10"

I didn't find the characters very scary, sometimes due to clunky AI, but I was generally scared at SOME bits of the game, mainly the flashback chapters. I liked that the game mixes up the slender games goal of finding eight pages, and there is more story to be told in this game than in previous games. The atmosphere is much scarier than slender man himself, especially ""the abyss"" level, the sounds and the atmosphere blend perfectly. The game had lots of replay value, going back to find all the secrets and easter eggs that you may have missed. I give the game an 7 out of 10, only because I thought the story was fairly intresting.

76561197979438474,Recommended,252330,8675449,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,Zednaught,"Slender: The Arrival is a horror game based on the popular (and free) Slender: The Eight Pages.  The game is relatively short (should be less than 2 hours for most people), and divided into several different chapters that each feature different gameplay.    Fans of the original will notice a substantial visual improvement, and effective use of sound.  This game understands how to execute a horror  experience- make the protagonist defenseless, and build up tension before a single encounter.The longest chapter is a recreation of the original Slender gameplay of collecting 8 pages, with them and their corresponding landmarks randomly distributed, with each further discovery angering a hostile presence in the woods.  Simple enough, and it's absolutely chilling. Collecting the pages is reasonably guided inside a large area, but still confusing at first.The sound and dim lighting crete a constant sense of unease, and when -something- appears, it caused a feeling of dread deep in my gut.  Even knowing that it was silly to be surprised multiple times, I'd still jump.  Twisted tree branches seen outside my flashlight often seemed like gnarled arms reaching out to me.  There's something about games like this, and the Amnesia or Penumbra series, that strike at something deep and primal in the subconscious.Every chapter after the first and second was not as impressive, and only one of them stood out to me.  For gamers concerned about value for their dollar, this may be an issue.  The story, told mostly through found letters, is pretty incomprehensible, and although good horror never shows all its cards, there's not a lot to grab hold of here.Personally, though, I think the quality and intensity of the experience is worth the low asking price.  A solid recommendation."

It meant to have a story behind why the Slender Man is after you, and a few others. What do I think of this game you may ask? Well, this review will cover that.First off, I will start with the setting and character's. The game take's place in an unspecified state of America. Most of it take's place in park with a radio tower and a mine complex. Now on to the character's. The game's protagonist is Lauren, a woman looking for her missing friend named Kate, who has recently disappeared. A man only known as CR can be read about in the in-game collectibles.He apeared to be somehow involved with Kate and the Slender Man, whom does not need an introduction.The next thing I want to cover is the overall gameplay. I think it is both good and bad. I will start the good. The atmosphere is probably the best part of the the game. It gave me an unsettling feeling throughout the game. Another great thing about The Arrival is the genuinely creepy music. It gets more and more tense as you complete the objectives. And also, not being able to fight back can also keep some people on edge.Now for the bad. Unfortunately, there are more bad aspects than you might be thinking. Let's start with the objectives. Pretty much every level involves somehow interacting with a certain amount of objects. It does'nt take very long for the game to start feeling quite repetitive. While a recent update added two new levels to branch off from this, those two levels are'nt very good and may leave quite a bit of gamers feel pretty unsatisfied after completing them. Another thing I will cover is the overall scares. They start out great, but lose their charm less than halfway through the game. The Slendern Man himself begins to dwindle as the as the game progresses. While he seems terrifying at first, he later starts to become less and less scary to the point that you can easily walk past him and not have even the slightest sense of fear. The two new enemies added also begin to have this effect. The hooded person at first seems pretty scary, but it's cheap jump scare attack becomes pretty un-scary and rather just annoying and cheaply animated. The skeletal figure is also pretty unsettling, but soon just apears to be a generic horror cliche. Another thing is the game's incredibly short length. The game can easily be finished in less than two hours, incuding the bonus level.The VerdictSlender: The Arrival simply feels rushed. The music and atmosphere are great, but the repetitive gameplay, cheap scare's, and extremely short length just ruins the experience. If you want a cheap and short horror game, buy Slender: The Arrival. If you want quality scares and fun gameplay, look elswhere.Overall, 5/10"

You soon find yourself running down a road leading to Kate’s house and by the time you reach the outside walls daylight has transformed into total darkness. You find the front door of the house wide open, inside completely empty. Your first action is to search for a flash light to lift the darkness and then set about investigating Kate’s disappearance. The whole idea of being alone in this game can be pretty daunting especially when you know there is a faceless man stalking you.Slender doesn’t really appear too much in the Prologue but he makes enough of an appearance to let you know he is there and watching you. You’ll be standing still and hear gravel shifting or footsteps behind you and then my personal favourite, a door shutting by itself!.You will find clues throughout the house in the form of scrapbook items which you can collect at any point and view via the Book in the main menu, these items give you some insight into what is going on within the game.In total there are nine stages, eight of these are story related with the extra stage being a revamp of the original Eight Pages and for those not familiar with the previous game, the aim is to collect eight pages scattered around a wooded area but you have to find all eight before Slender kills you. Pages can be found tacked to objects like trees and cars and you can very quickly find yourself running in circles looking for them while praying your flashlight doesn’t run out.The game also introduces two brand new stages namely Homestead and a secret stage only revealed after finding a secret object while in the stage Flashback which itself has been split into two stages to accommodate Homestead. Now the end of Flashback is called Escape.There is also a new enemy to deal with, one that does not appear in the original release and you’ll find him on the third stage.Overall the game is very short and can be easily completed in less than an hour. Maybe what it needed was a longer and stronger storyline, one that wasn’t so repetitive. But seeing as it was already a well known game across the steam community it was to be expected that not much would change coming across to the consoles. Though with new content there is something to look forward to and of course there is the main protagonist Slender who without a doubt will make you jump when he randomly appears throughout the game and trust me, turning around to get a face full of him, turning my screen all distorted and full of static was enough to give me goosebumps or attempting to make my way through a burning forest with his tentacles appearing in front of me trying to grab me, made me wonder why I didn’t just remain in the cave.The game is a lot of fun to play, especially in a darkened room by yourself or maybe with friends I would also recommend playing it with headphones in or if you have it surround sound because it makes the experience that much scarier. If you are a fan of the games and all things Slender you shouldn’t be too disappointed and if you’re someone who has only ever heard about Slender it’s definitely worth checking out. To sum it up, if you’re looking for a storyline forget it but if you love being scared senseless while wandering around in the darkness then this should suit you down to the ground. Hopefully in the future Slender will get the retail game it surely deserves."

I played the beta type game, Slender the eight pages. This game is a fun thriller game play with headphones for best ""scare"". It starts very well and becomes scary during some parts. I also really like how they put a story around it so while you play you arnt playing looking for eight pages for who knows what reason. The think i dont like about this game is it is way to short six levels and 3-4 of them are the only scary levels. It is great how it starts off getting you to know the story of what is going on but still keeping you questioning then starting the second level out just like the beta version. After that (was very easy after playing the free demo version) the second level was very diffucult to me I liked how it was generators you were looking for not pages and how the little girl you had to look at unlike slender. Yet this level was challanging it also only took 5-10 times to finally beat it. The next few levels where kinda just run and dont die levels for me a get from point A to point B and dont die, sure i died 2 or 3 times but beat the game in the first sitting of playing.

(I felt this was the scariest part, if not the best part of the game)Now for the bad things:-You had Marble Hornets people on this project (No, this isn't even that bad, but I expected there to be Kate as a proxy, which was sort of a buzzkill.)-Obviously we get to play as CR, but my question remains WHO THE HELL IS CR?! All you've given us is the level ""Homestead"".-Hardcore mode.-We saw Kate as a normal human, but what the hell made her shorter, and more flexable?

76561198002280442,Recommended,252330,13292612,"Posted: 9 December, 2014",all,Rai,"Rather short game, and suffers from few flaws that are just stupid. If you pick up a document, the game tells you that it can always be viewed from the Main Menu. However, this resets your game and in case you were in the middle of a chapter, you have to start all over again. Chapters aren't overly long, so it's not a big loss, but it's still tedious and annoying. Though the documents aren't needed after reading them up once, they are in every other game similar to this, thus most players will fall for this trap due to natural player instinct.Another issue I must address is the running. It's way too slow. When you wanna run away or just get somewhere fast, and you aren't sure if your character is walking or running, something is wrong indeed. I never actually figured out if there was a hidden stamina meter, or if the running was just bugged, but at times it seemed to slow down really badly, and it can get pretty annoying pretty fast. Especially in those scenes where a player's natural instict is to run, it doesn't really add to the feeling that you feel like a flea in a tarpuddle.But is Slender: The Arrival a bad game then? Absolutely not. And to its credit, I must say that the parts that are meant to be scary really work! This game manages to create a frightening and eerie mood without relying solely on jumpscares like so many other horror games do. Plus the game randomizes certain elements (such as the locations of key items), so that there is at least something new on each playthrough. I wouldn't necessarily pay 10€ from it, but it's definately worth to try for a horror game fan.I do recommend this game to any horror game fan, but with a little bit of caution =) The menu ""trap"" becomes a neglectable issue once you know it, and despite the running being very boring at times, it doesn't ruin the game. But they are still there. But all and all, this game has potential, and the Devs should be given credit for it =)"

This game isn't terribly twisted or gross like a lot of horror games, it's just all about keeping your anxiety level high! Don't get me wrong, the story and atmosphere keep you creeped out, but what's really creepy is that, for much of the game, the slender man can appear anytime, anywhere, and all you can do is run as fast as you can in the opposite direction.It only takes a couple of hours to play through, if you're not trying to get 100% everything, but it's worth the ride.A negative would be that the story isn't all that interesting or coherent.

The settings are all very similar, and the camera overlay was a nice touch.It has a good atmosphere, with creepy sound cues and lighting. This could have been improved with more buildup of tension as seen in amnesia and in the slender vlogs, where you anticipate that something will happen around every corner. Still, the environments are well designed, and the graphics are very good, including shadows, hdr and a nice touch of colour distortion from slendy at various points in the game. The game also runs very smoothly, unlike the first game (8 pages) which had serious fps issues.The jump scares are fantastic, and really make the game. To see slendy in front of you and then turn around to find him behind you is terrifying, and is a good change from other horror games where you can just lock the door and know that you will be alerted to the monsters arrival when he tries to break it down.The proxy is a questionable addition in my opinion, and not well designed. While its good to have another enemy to run from, there seems to be no way of getting rid of her or to combat her. She will just stand there indefinetley when you point the torch at her, and when you runaway, she will suddenly appear out of nowhere behind you and kill you. Initially she is scary, but after the 5th time she gets you in a few minutes, she becomes more of an annoying obstacle than a terrifying monster.Overall, while the game does have its faults, it is still a fantastic horror game, and also a must have for any fan of the slenderman mythos and videos."

None of my experiences so far, in real life or with movies, comes close to what I feel when I play this game.  I thought I would be strong enough to deal with all that over-hyped Slenderman meme.  I am not.  It could be Slender, it could be anything, it hardly matters, I have never felt so helpless and terrified in my entire life.

,Recommended,252330,18538278,"Posted: 17 October, 2015",all,Scrubsauce,"I was first introduced to ""Slenderman"" by a co-worker back in 2010 when the original Something Awful creepy-pasta contest entry was just starting to gain some meme-level ground.  I spent a late night after closing at the drug store we were employed at looking over all of the classic photoshops of a tall, thin man holding the hands of children and appearing just out of the foreground in old black and white photos.  Browsing creepy-pastas and looking at a picture trying to find ""the monster"" somewhere in the trees became a bit of a spooky ""Eye Spy"" game.My curiousity in the concept of Slenderman would eventually lead me, like many intrepid fans, to Marble Hornets.  This isn't the outlet to critique THAC's series, but if you're interested in the writing style employed in Slender: The Arrival (STA), I would suggest looking it up on YouTube.About two years later, Slender: The Eight Pages (STEP) hit the scene and started blowing up online when ""Let's Play"" style shows and streams started to pick up steam in the gaming community.  I'll admit, STEP often lead me to facepalm when a professor would ask inquistively to the class ""what's a slender man?"" and a half dozen classmates would respond ""its this game-"", etc.  My roommates and I still ended up downloading the game and plugging a laptop into our 36"" Vizio on Halloween night 2012 to properly get spooked out.  The screams eventually died out by midnight as the novelty wore off and we started to figure out how to game the AI, but I digress.I'm offering all of this information up as I feel that my familiarity with Slenderman (the creepy-pastas, the various YouTube shows, the movie, etc.) greatly impacts my reccomendation for this game.  If you're unfamiliar with the whole concept of Slenderman this might not be the best way to start into those (sometimes super spooky) waters.STA, while not a perfect execution, really manages to nail a few of its key components.  The levels go back and forth between variations on the original STEP gameplay with ""collecting"" something randomly placed around the map while avoiding a stalking, and increasingly aggressive enemy, and what some may ""lovingly"" refer to as a ""walking simulator"".  Both gameplay styles are evenly paced out so neither have enough time to grow stale in long bursts.  The exploration levels, and well, the entire game looks gorgeous.  The environments stay with you in this game, even after a week after I completed my playthrough I still remember the striking landscapes more than anything else.  Various collectable pamphlets, emails, etc. dot the maps and help build out the core cast and their history.  I would reccomend tracking these down as they provide most of the world building and really highlight the writing contributions provided by THAC for the game's script.The player controlled character can feel kind of clunky and slow at times, and I undestand the limited endurance was a design decision to prevent constant sprinting away from enemies but in the portions without something to avoid this can feel somewhat limiting.  The graphics for props, buildings, etc. aren't anything to write home about, but the wilderness and skyboxes always manage to look gorgeous.  Finally, I think my main issue with this game is that after my first death at the hands of Slenderman (or The Operator, or whatever) the scare factor had mostly worn off.  Again, I attribute this to already being burnt out on STEP and other Slenderman series.  The model's head just doesn't seem right either, especially with the more defined cheek bones.  I prefer Slenderman to only have a human silohuette and no other details in the face, but again, that's a personal preference.So, if you liked STEP (and speaking of which, this game contains an HD remaster of that level unlocked after beating the main story), or are just a fan of anything Slenderman I'd reccomend this.  Its no AAA horror game, but its a competent couple hour romp."

It's not just Slendy anymore. There are new enemies, new challenges, new graphics, and new music. All of these add to the suspence and diarrhea inducing climate of Slender: The Arrival. If you have the money hanging around and you enjoy horror games, I recomend this. Games like Amnesia are scary, but they take time to get you into the game. Slender: The Arrival throws you head first into a vat of ""Omfg it's getting dark out and I have no idea what I'm doing"". This is a game where you know something's chasing you, you know something's going to pop out at you, but you still jump and scream like a cooked lobster when it happens. The game stays true to the original but adds other aspects, other levels of scary. I highly recommend this game if you want a heart racing experience and you're into wearing diapers.

It had a complete story line to lore you in, a beautifully building atmosphere, and the graphics where absolutely STUNNING. There are little few bugs from what I've found(And trust me, the second I get a game, I like trying to break the maps to said game.), and a nice map to free explore.But by far, the best thing I found about Slender: The Arrival, HAD to be it's atmosphere. It had a great build up that left the player on edge, which made the jump scares all the more better. The rustling of the forest around you, the crunching of the leaves, or in the case of the generator level, the sound of footsteps running at you, all help immerse the player. The game uses rather nice functions of forcing the player to do what they don't want to, such as entering a building or going down a hall to grab a note, knowing they'll have to go back and he might be standing there.Although, I will say, the complaint I have about this game is that the enemies themselves often get stuck on objects while coming after you. It subtracts from the game play to know if you angel yourself right or quick turn a corner, you could get them stuck there for a moment. In Slenders case, He'll become unstuck the second you move to far away and instead transport away, but in Kate/Jeff The Killer/ Whoever the one running after you is, They could get stuck there for a good while.This game is best played in the dark, with either surround sound or headphones in for best possible outcome.Overall, I'd give it a 8.9 of 10."

That being said, it's a good story, and it will get your adrenaline going. The story is more of a bonus, with the 8-pages (which can be played as a single game-mode at any time) still being the most exciting mode with the best re-play value. Among some of the story-mode levels, there are a few gems, such as a level that takes place in an abandoned underground mine where you must turn on a series of generators in order to escape, all while being pursued by Slender AND an unknown assailant! This level plays just like the 8-pages mode, so it' really just for more variety.My only""complaint""about this game is the seemingly random level of difficulty. Occassionally I will play a round of the 8-pages or abandoned mine level and run into Slendy and his friend at every turn, while the next round I'll find all the generators and never even see my pursuers.

And I was scared to play it, however when I bought it on steam, my experience changed. first of all, the controls are simple and easy to figure out and use, the graphics are amazing as long as the gamma is right (And as long as you don't pay attention to the graphics of the humans). Also, the story is very well set out, I am still reading the notes from CR and other people. The story slowly unravels amungst 8 levels. However, after completeing the game you get the original Slenderman The Eight pages map sort of remade! This game might be 40 minutes for some, however it is definetley worth the time.

Gameplay is mostly simple; finding a number of objects and completing a number of goals. The graphics and ambience and atmosphere is all good and Slenderman is creepy. this game can be very hard at times...espescially those times you are oh so close to finishing the map objectives only to be terrorized by the monsters. It is so dark you will often wish you had two flashlights instead of one. Not a bad game but feels like luck has more to do with anything rather than skill or logic or thinking ability.

The atmosphere is really nostalgic, intriguing and remind me of those 80s movies, when a good story really touched your guts and when we use to jump in out seats, to feel as if you had experience everyting that happen, when movies were, somehow, as reales experiences. Slender is very detail oriented, and most of the information and the background story is given in a very smart and indirect way There is the dynamics of looking for pages, and walk several times through the same places, but it doesnt matter, because its part of the agony of being followed by something evil that may have captured your friend... so you can only move forward. The game is short, though, you can have it finish in less than an hour, but it took me 4 hours my first time. Its a game I will play again, definitly, and its one of those experiences, as the 80s movies, that makes feel as if they have told me something profund."

Slender: The Arrvival is a short game which I payed £15 for. That was about £5. When I say short, I mean short. A campaign which can take under 20 minutes to complete, the game is filled with missions which all add up to about 1 hour of gameplay. Unfortunately, your given little knowledge of how to activate some of them. For example, the scariest chapter in the game, Homestead, can be played by clicking on the TV screen after playing a recording in which you play as the main charaters Mother. Most of the Chapters are pretty short as too.If your looking for a scare then this is the game to buy. I genuinly♥♥♥♥♥♥myself playing this game. It is an excellent blend of jumpscares, atmosphere, and a truly-terrifying story. The mission where you play as Charlie as a child undoubtedly disturbed me. However, if your looking for a fun horror game, then you should probrably look for another game. The gameplay is sticky and unevenly paced, and the scares mask over any type of enjoyment for the light-hearted.But out of all of this, the worst part of this game is each of the 3 endings. For players who bought the game without Steam, the game ends in the radio tower when you get jumped byCharlie. On the Steam version, the game advances to an old burnt down barn I had previously visited in the game. This is by for the best ending in the game.Unfortunately, it's all about waiting, but it does reveal the rest of the story. Within 5 minutes of this scary atmosphere, you die and.... game over.However, the final ending, which is activated by playing through the game in Hardcore mode, is so bad it's hilarious. For some reason the your character jumps off the radio tower and, dies. Yep, that's it.My personal review is a 5/10, because of how inconsistent the game actually is. It is far too overrated."

The graphics and atmosphere are great, and although the game does rely primarily on jump scares, I don't feel like that detracts from the gameplay. It also doesn't take too long to finish, if you manage not to punch your computer monitor in a fit of terror along the way.Perfect for those with heart problems, high blood pressure, and constipation. Also nearly gave my friend an aneurysm when they watched me play. Would recommend."

I'm not saying it wasn't a bad game, not at all. I enjoy how the game doesn't tell you what's going on and forces you to think of every level like a peice of a puzzle."

This game presents the figure of Slender Man, not only Slender Man, but also presents another figure in creepypaste that we know, namely ""JEFF THE KILLER"". This game is much better than the previous game ""Slender The Eight Pages"". With horror shades that are so tense, jumpscares that make your heart dance, and also a very beautiful graphics. If you are a creepypaste lover, I highly recommend this game for you to play. I really like Slender Man, and I really like this game. Be careful who the tall figure of a suit is behind you!

But even after all that i still recommend it.Oh, and i also have a question:The Environments in this game are so beautiful, i was wondering if you could add a free roam mode, where you can explore all in-game locations at your own leasure.

From the beginning He makes his point to let you know that he is upon you since the darkness has swallowed the woods, and you, who is completely at his mercy, must scavenge through the abyss of the dark thicket to find the classic 8 pages, only to find that there is more horror than you could imagine.This is a wonderful game, with some new twists on the classic Slender. The game has the classic ominous feel as Slendy stalks you thought the woods and you gather the 8 pages, with each page another layer of soundtrack and a more aggressive foe, building up the anticipation of the end, only bringing you to more discoveries. In which new discoveries you get to encounter a new foe that hounds you more violently than our beloved classic."

It has a story that will have you wondering when you're not getting scared. While playing this game, you will always feel as if there is something behind you. There's not much room for playability though, except for playing this game all over again after a couple of months."

The game is not too long but contains quite a lot of secrets and collectibles. There is also some RNG so replayability is there."
