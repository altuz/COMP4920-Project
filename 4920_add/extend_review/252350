,Recommended,252350,8999877,"Posted: 6 February, 2014",all,Angry Canadian Gamer,"As an old-school twitch gamer, one of my better memories was consistently beating the original Double Dragon in arcades on a single quarter. It was one of the first arcade beat-em-ups and arguably one of the best of its time. Now WayForward has finally brought their reimagining of the franchise to PC after a console release in late 2012.Pros:------ Neon introduces a few new concepts to the genre such as Gleam, which doubles your attack power for a short time after successfully dodging an attack and an upgrade system for magic attacks and passive bonuses in the form of mixtapes. The more of a mixtape you have, the more powerful that attack or bonus is. Enemies drop them, but you can also buy them from shops. Tapesmiths allow you to pick up more tapes in exchange for mythril, which you get from defeating bosses.- (Note: I played with an XBox 360 controller) While there are more button commands to get used to than the original, the controls feel very solid. Nothing seems janky or off. I suggest a quick glance at the Help screen to see all your available standard moves.- There is a good variety of enemies, some requiring a specific way to finish them off quicker than just mashing your punch button. Abobos are freakin' huge now!- Effects and voice acting are passable, but what really stands out is the soundtrack. Virt has done an amazing job making original songs for the game that have that definite 80's vibe and the remixing of the original game's tracks are very well done.- ONLINE CO-OP. It took the PC port of this game to get what console owners were promised over a year ago and never received, online co-op. Beat-em-ups are always 10x more fun with a friend, and with team powerups like sharing health that you can activate almost anytime by high-fiving your partner, it makes traversing the game easier as well.- Unlike the dark, gritty visuals of the original, this game goes for a brighter, cartoony aesthetic. This game knows its audience and opted for a campy, offbeat feel, almost making fun of the era it wants to copy, and it mostly works.Cons:------ All these attacks at my command and NO BACK ELBOW? Anyone who played the original Double Dragon knows that move is your bread and butter for making progress in the game.- Graphics are alright and the game has a cartoony vibe, but nothing really stands out. Also, apart from resolutions and windowed/full screen mode, there's no graphical tweaking. I'm not saying a game like this really needs those options, but when you see them in nearly every PC game, it's noticeable when they're missing.I feel this is one of WayForwards best games to date. Much like with DuckTales Remastered, they have honoured the source material while adding a modern flair. Join up with a friend and go save Marion!"

I will try and address them and give my opinion as to why this is probably one of the top three Double Dragon games.**Graphics:Solid art design, although some of the enemies are a bit more cartoony than previous DD designs, the colors, backgrounds, animations and effects are pretty solid. The game mixes 3D models with the occasional 2D background object, The alley level is particularly nice. Varied environments and enemies with vibrant colors.**Sound:Great remixes of classic double dragon tunes and some new additions. Music and sounds are near flawless in this game. Some may loathe the voice acting, but for the tone they're going for, it's appropriate.**Controls:The game controls solidly for me. A lot of ""Double Dragon veteran"" players have criticized how slow and heavy the Lee brothers move, but I think they haven't played DD for a while. DD was always a slower, more methodical game than other beat 'em ups. Neon is actually a little bit faster (go check youtube, watch Super Double Dragon, or DD II). The dodge button is responsive, although you're vulnerable if you execute some moves. The dash is not instant unlike DD Advance and DD3, and that can be a cause for some headaches.**Gameplay:The game has a lot of moves, and some combos . Clever players can find ways to juggle opponents multiple times and incorporate grabs and special moves while doing so. The Lee brothers have mixtapes that grant abilities and special moves like fireballs, hurricane kicks, etc. You can't steamroll through waves of enemies thoughtlessly though, as enemies have some moves with ""armor"", not many, but it does require some recognition on the player. Players who dodge attacks correctly get a temporary buff. It's a nice addition, though not as satisfying as Super Double Dragon's parry and grab mechanics from blocking.**Verdict:For Insider: 8/10I've played every iteration of Double Dragon, even the three fighting games (if you count Rage). I knew exactly what to expect from this game. I give it an 8/10. I've beaten it in normal and Dragon difficulty, working on replaying it again to do so in Double Dragon difficulty (which is quite hard).  Highly recommend it.For Casual: 6/10Don't even listen or Read IGN's super ignorant review of this game. It's a solid game if you like slower methodical beat' em ups. My wife is an RPG, Strategy game gamer and was able to beat this game a few times with me. She enjoyed the humor and although she doesn't always play beat 'em ups, she really enjoyed this one.  6/10For newer fans to the genre: 3/10 to 5/10These fans will probably hate this game the most. If you're used to the speed of Castle Crashers and want to blow through enemies with fast attacks and screen clearing moves this game is not like that. Watch some of the youtube videos for this game, but approach with caution.** Extras InfoGame's tone is different from prior DD games, at first I was frustrated by this as I wanted a serious DD game, but the game did get more than a few laughs out of me. There are plenty of easter eggs and references to 80s-90s games and culture."

But none the less its still a great game, and I would recommend it to any one who is a fan of the genre.One thing that threw me off and is one of my favorite aspects of the game is the amazing sound track.

Unfortunatly I advise anybody looking into this game based on principle to not purchase it.  It does not matter how cheap it is.  Take one look at the forums.  The game has not worked on Windows 10 with an NVIDIA card for much of anybody and the developer/publisher have had over two months to fix this for which they have decided to just ignore the problem and hope it goes away.  No support from the publisher/developer means they do not deserve our business.  I repeat this game will crash continuoulsy at odd intervals without fail on Windows 10 with NVIDIA.  DO NOT BUY.  Two months and no acknowledgement of a problem despite tons of reports.

There were at least two sequels I know of, which were also a blast to play. I think this game stays true enough to the game series that it could be seen as a sequel as much as a remake. It is fun to play on your own, online or with local co-op. There are upgrades to buy that allow you customise your play style to a certain extent. One play through will take 3 hours approx.

This is the best Double Dragon I've ever played, and I've played them all, including the arcade originals. If you've played the console version of Neon, it's the same game here, with one big exception: As of this review, the console version of DDN does not have online co-op, while the PC version does. That's a big seller for me. Also, it seems to me the PC version of Double Dragon Neon has more responsive controls. Play this with a gamepad or prepare to get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you often.If you haven't played DDN, or any DD game in general, it's your standard 2D beat 'em up. You can collect cassette tapes to gain new abilities and fighting styles and upgrade them. DDN is quite challenging, but not unfairly so. Learn to dodge or get ready to get whooped.

Double Dragon: Neon is a worthy successor to its legacy, an improvement in many ways and a love letter in others. This is kind of like the byproduct of distilling down all the side-on brawlers in arcade history, removing the impurities and foul aftertaste, and setting it to a high energy 80's movie soundtrack.On a mechanical level, Double Dragon: Neon is well designed and planned; the challenge structure and difficulty curve are both clearly designed with the history of the side-on arcade brawler taken well into consideration, sidestepping common pitfalls such as annoying AI and unreasonable level design. The character advancement system is a little unorthodox, but functions well. The soundtrack and visual design all blend together with the fast, skillful gameplay into a fun and energetic experience.Maybe most importantly, the game has an incredible sense of humor about it. Puns and 80's slang are used liberally, and the whole of the story has a kind of intentional ironic camp perfect for the modern tribute to a game so iconic of a bygone era.As close to perfect as it comes, there's still a few annoyances. Overcoming some of the challenges in the second half of the game require having improved versions of the passive-strength increasing ""stance"" mixtapes, which are either dropped at random or acquired from stores in specific parts of specific levels. With the levels themselves being linear, this means it can potentially be a real pain to upgrade. I also find myself needing to cycle mixtapes very frequently during some of the areas, even several times during a single fight; I imagine this is probably worse with two simultaneous players needing to frequently open the menu and switch tapes.Oh, and for whatever reason, I couldn't figure out how to play as solo Jimmy Lee. I have no idea why.These are very small flaws in an otherwise awesome experience. This is what more remakes of classic games should be, equal parts self-aware humor and amazing gameplay."

Due to what seems to be a memory leak issue, after a short while the game will crash to desktop. 3rd party programs attempt to fix this problem by increasing the amount of memory available to the program; this increases the time you can play before it crashes but cannot truly fix the problem. The longest I could play this game before crashing with a patch was about 1 hour 15 minutes. Without the patch, maybe 15-20 minutes at a time.Outside of that issue, the gameplay is fairly standard fare for a Beat 'em Up. It might be my overall lukewarm opinion on the genre in general, but I find it incredibly boring because of the same uninteresting combos you use for the entirety of the game. Variety is attempted through constantly introducing new enemies and environments as you play, but you don't really handle them any different, so I don't know if it really matters. Final thoughts on gameplay is that it feels like a chore you go through to see the rest of the game, after the game crashes (always at the end of a level, of course) neither I nor the handful of people I've played it with feel any desire to replay the level.Gameplay out of the way, though, and the game has a really nice feel to it. That ""mock 80's retro"" feel played up to 11 gives you something to smile about throughout the game and the soundtrack -- by the wonderful Jake Kaufman --  is a treat. I'm also a fan of the antagonist: Skullmageddon, an over the top Skeletor-like villain. I hear that the ending credits are simply amazing, but as I can't get the game working long enough to beat it I haven't actually seen them.Conclusion / tl;dr :While the aesthetic is charming, the incredibly repetitive gameplay and horrific bug(s) that nobody thinks they need to fix make this game something I can't recommend."

The combat in this game is the best I've ever played in a side-scroller beat'em up. It almost feels like playing a side-scroller Street Fighter game with RPG-esque elements thrown in with shops found throughout the levels. Dodging and countering are very meaningful and give a real sense of achievement when you can successfully fight your way through a crowd taking very little damage or using the environment to your advantage. In addition to your own ability to combo through a crowd, you are also equiped with different ""songs"" that equate to abilities/magics, one being a passive buff and the other a special attack. I liked the brawler feel so I went with an absorb health/spin kick combo, it works really well to keep your health up and bulldoze waves of enemies. I really enjoyed the humor of this game, it really hit me in the right spot.  The original version of double dragons was among the first games I ever got my hands on and played heck trying to get to work in our overused Nintendo. It feels even more fun to play it as an adult on here than it did as a kid. Even if you're not wearing rose colored glasses like me, this game will rock your socks."

Neon is one of the better beat 'em ups out there, peppered with jokes lampooning its own franchise as well as the '80s in general, counterbalanced by some irritatingly sloppy pieces.  Namely all its cutscenes, ending, and 8 company logos being unskippable.  Since so much of the humor is based on novelty, there are a lot of diminishing returns that just aren't designed for these drawn out, repeat viewings... which the game is centered around with a stat-grinding system.Another bad design decision is mythril collecting as part of the grind.  The gimmick achieves nothing beyond making half the stages not worth re-entering, cutting down variety.  Worse, there are only two stages in the game that let you apply them with only one being useful, so I hope you like sitting through rocket blast-offs.  This and the cutscene issue won't register as much on a first playthrough, given it's an easy-going romp into escalating wackiness, but they build up.Neon's enemies are on the cheaper side, loaded with armored, prioritized, or just plain invincible attacks that can take a while to learn.  It's the kind of game where a pistol shot has a 5ft wide hitbox and takes off half your life.  The tricky ducking mechanic is essential to sruvival but something of a double-edged sword.  Succeeding multiplies your attack power and fills your energy meter to instantly waste enemies like a total badass.  But mastering it is pure trial by clobber, since different opponents naturally have different attacks, timings, and provocations.  Not to mention other arbitrary factors like being able to duck under some attacks that hit the ground but not all that stop above it.  It's not very intuitive or forgiving, but more reasonable than the quarter-munching difficulty of the old days.  The satisfaction of turning every attack back on your opponents is quite sweet.There are occasional bugs and hang-ups, like suddenly not being able to stop running (happens most often against the tank boss) or your special moves refusing to come out as you stand there with a full meter.  Sometimes, the game just doesn't want to let you to perform a ground attack on downed enemies.  I once saw chemical fire from a vial never dissipate.  And while not an error, I do wish the game prioritized letting you grab an enemy you knocked into the air instead of bending over to pick up what they just dropped.  That little quirk has gotten me killed a few times in the Haunted Forest.Double Dragon Neon has a lot of room for refinement, but all these flaws are more than fair for a low risk, low priced venture.  The art direction is vibrant and appealing, the retro soundtrack is catchy, and in the grand scheme of things, it plays better than most beat 'em ups, old and new.  I felt the game start to drag under its problems after a playthrough or two, but trying to master it on a higher difficulty, found there was plenty of enjoyable depth behind the unbalanced learning curve.  Even if you just want an easy nostalgia fix, the easiest difficulty keeps the challenge frustration free, making it a solid investment.Now that Arc System Works owns the DD license, I wonder if Wayforward is not allowed to tinker with or create DLC for Neon.  Some quick fixes would go a long way and there is a great foundation for expansion here.  Aside from adding cutscene skips, the mythril problem could be solved by simply stuffing some in the dragon pinatas in odd numbered stages.  When you discount Abobo variants, there are only 4 traditional beat 'em up bosses total and 3 are the same guy.  A few more opponents, even if they showed up in reused stage assets, would add a lot."

Billy and Jimmy's new adventure is a reimagining of the first entry in the series, a game which (maybe) we all know and love, having new stages, new moves and power-ups, good voice acting and a great sountrack by Jake Kaufman, heavily inspired by 80's rock and pop music.Double Dragon Neon is a good-looking game; the characters have a colourful hybrid manga/cartoon style which looks a bit reminiscent of Marvel Mangaverse comic books, and are superbly animated, with impressive moves like roundhouse kicks and fast combo sequences. Backgrounds are also nice and have a good variety, ranging from urban landscapes to forests and even a spaceship, though sometimes they may feel a bit bland. Gameplay is excellent - the controls respond quickly, there is no slowdown whatsoever, and the range of fighting moves and special abilities are enough to keep things interesting.However, it is not a flawless game. Although difficulty is fairly balanced for most of the time, boss battles and certain moments when the screen is too crowded can be a real pain, especially to newcomers to the genre; the first battle against Skullmageddon (""I'm your worst night-maaaaah!"") can be especially cheap, and some minions like the teleporting ninja girls, though not unbeatable, may become a serious nuisance. Repeating a stage after many game overs and moments of serious button-mashing can be really boring, but is ultimately satisfying once the player learns the ropes of each mission.I feel this could have been a better game, although it is not bad - far from it, actually. It plays and feels kind of ""westernized"" (even though not to an extent that could ruin the experience), but WayForward Technologies (the same people behind the Shantae series, which is one of the best series of all time if you ask me) did a great job in preserving the superb gameplay that made the earlier Double Dragon games so great, and added new elements that are enough to keep things fresh. Players who yearn for solid, old-school-style beat 'em up should definitely try this one. - 8.5/10"

The devs obviously have a lot of love for the genre and Double Dragon (even though the style they chose funny as it is, has little in common with DD which was never what the latest trend of Kung Fury/80s style parodies are doing now - so some hardcore fans of the original might find the shift questionable), there are some great ideas behind it, some work, some don't (not sure if grinding and rpg elements add depth or just drag it) but unfortunately it all comes down to the game's main problem which is the sluggish controls and combat.Considering this is a Double Dragon game, you can understand how important this is. Everything feels slow, not very responsive - a thing that becomes even more noticeable and irritating in the few platforming segments - , limited movesets and even missing classic moves that have been the staple of the franchise forever (no hair pull/knee on face?!), some cheap difficulty and encounters where opponents and bosses have some iffy invincibilty at times, a bit of repetition with stage traps and worst of all: the weapons!Yes, as strange as it sounds I never felt so dissapointed with weapons picking in a Double Dragon game, one of the most famous mechanics the game introduced. The animations drag, the hit detection is not always perfect and picking and using weapons felt less rewarding and more of a thing to avoid so you won't get easily hit.And why no d-input support? At least for me the gamepads could not work with the game! :(Another problem for some systems including mine was the eventual framedrops and stuttering that happens after a while, I guess due to memory problems?Not everything is bad though, some stages have great art direction, the music is a blast to hear (what a great soundtrack, both new songs and homages and remixes to the classic ones!), and special mention has to be made for one of the funniest and greatest end credits in a game ever!Of course I may sound as if the game is horrible, but it is not! There is enjoyment out of the game and if you sit and remember the past horrible shoddy ports and various awful games that have tarnished the brand in the past, this is definitely one of the better efforts. The game might not exactly feel like a Double Dragon and the controls are not that good, but at least it is playable (!!) and a fun little beat em up that pays homage to the genre.It's just unfortunate that the devs could not repeat the fastness, fluidity and overall greatness of what I call ""The definitive Double Dragon"" of Double Dragon Advance, a game so many years older but - forgive me for the pun - so much more advanced than Neon.Still an admirable effort!I hope this is not the last we see of Billy Jimmy & Marian!"

At first I thought it was going to suck, being just some dumb cash-in on 80's retro.I ended up loving this game.The first time I played it was with a friend and we co-opped it in a single sitting. Playing it again, solo, I still had a blast.For anyone who doesn't know what Double Dragon is, DD was one of the pre-eminent beat 'em ups back in the day. Many series tried to emulate the simplicity of punching, kicking, kneeing, throwing, and spin kicking mobs of bad guys into bloody submission. Few achieved their goal.And that's really all DD is about: beating the tar out of a colorful cast of villains. The plot is paper thin, and that's okay, we're not really here for the story. DD Neon updated the tried and true formula DD 1 and 2 perfected by adding a ton of special moves and character builds to the mix. That might sound pretty not Double Dragon, but it actually adds a nice bit of depth to simple gameplay. Want to excel at offense? Defense? Physical attacks or special moves? Want to throw a fireball? Some lighting? How about a head crushing knee drop? The options are varied and allow the game to cater to many different play styles.The graphics are bright, colorful, and varied. The music is insanely good, offering plenty of original tunes as well as some sick remixes of classic songs. And the controls are good. A little slow, but it gives the game a nice pace.A game like this is why Wayforward is one of my favorite developers. A Boy and His Blob, Ducktales, and Double Dragon: they take classic games and create playable love letters to them.If you love DD, play this. If you haven't played DD before, but enjoy good arcade style action games, play this.What are you waiting for? Hurry up, buttlord!"

Back in the day, this was state of the art, and “Beat-em-ups” were awesome! Fast forward 28 years, and I'm playing the reboot. Here's my opinion of the game. WayForward, and Abstract Games did a really nice job with this. It's a blast from the past, with a few more controls, and a level up system. The early 90's vibe is great, the NPC characters say funny things, and the bosses are over the top. The arcade feel is still there, minus the quarters. They added moves, and combos that are great. Once you spend a little time with the game, you'll find yourself really getting creative on your beat downs, even more so if your playing co-op. Sadly one of my favorite moves seems to have been omitted. The hair grab, followed by three or four knee kicks to the face is gone. It's a minor gripe, but if you played the arcade version you'll be missing it. You can level up a special move, as well as basic overall stats through cassette tapes you collect and buy. You then can increase your level cap on these tapes by going to the tape smith to forge them using meteorites you collected from boss battles. Sounds confusing, but its just the games currency. The soundtrack is great. Remixes from the original arcade tracks, and some 90's ish tunes. Couch co-op is a blast, and full controller support for the Xbox 360 pad works well. The game will run well on most systems (not your grandmas Windows 95, but anything from 2012 and up should be fine).

,Recommended,252350,16192990,"Posted: 4 June, 2015",all,sarysa,"What can I say? This is a love letter for kids of the 80's. I'd played Double Dragon I and II, thankfully not III from what I've heard about it. Double Dragon: Neon is heavily derived from those, and was intended to be a classic reboot. Since most 80's games made no real world sense, it relies on humor instead of trying to be serious, and it does a pretty good job. The game references 80's pop music, hard rock, hair metal, along with references to 80's television programs, including the very recognizable main villain.This game introduces to the series 10 special attacks, though only one can be equipped at a time. Like all modern games feel like they must do, there's an arbitrary level up system for ""stances"" you equip, as well as these special attacks. There are a number of special attacks initiated through button combos, much like your typical beat-em-up and fighting genres. Because of this level up system, it creates somewhat parabolic difficulty as it starts off hard, gets easier fast, gets kind of wavy until you decide to get the repetition over with, then becomes hard again once you unlock Double Dragon difficulty. Honestly I wish they'd have stuck to more classic style difficulty scales, but ""experience points"" seems to be a box to check when it comes to modern game design.A couple more universally agreeable flaws came pretty close to me giving this one a thumbs down, including:- After about 3 full levels or so, performance seems to gradually decay. It could be specific to the GTX 670 or certain families of NVidia drivers (and mine are up-to-date), but what happens is over time, there'll be increasing frequencies of frame drops until it affects gameplay too much (especially with platforming in the later levels) and I ultimately restart the game.- I've had the game crash, but it only happened once over 6 hours of split play sessions.- There's so many logos at the start of the game, it almost seems like parody. You can't bypass them either. Seriously, forcing me to look at your logos for 20-30 seconds won't make me appreciate your companies at all.- The ending also can't be bypassed even if you've seen it before.- It's a little time consuming going to the shop and songsmith. Probably should have had its own level on the world map. (that world map that does absolutely nothing)- It's going to take you some time to get used to control timing. Due to being tied to ""realistic"" animations, many actions like running and turning around are too sluggish for a video game.That said, I found the game enjoyable. For the $10 game tier, it's right where it should be."

And needs much love for fans who love Double Dragon, beat'em ups, and nostalgia trips of the 70s and 80s.The Good: The game has a vintage feel of controls like a blast from the past. The music in this game features remixes of classic theme music from past Double Dragon games, and some new original music thrown in as well that is up beat and awesone to beat down. Making you wish there was a sound track seperate to the game. Graphics is smooth and the art style and theme of the game with ""Neon"" fits perfect of 80s throwback. The game now features some RPG elements, such as power tapes that can increase your stats and powers as the levels start to get slowly harder with tougher enemies. There are a veriety of weapons for you to pick up and use. The bosses have predictable partens in this game, but provide challange. Most of the game has a lot of pop culture references of the 70s, 80s, and even 90s. Unlike the console ports, the PC version offers what all Double Dragon fans wanted in the game, which is online bro-op, co-op. So there is a lot of replayability with this game featuring co-op online or off.The Bad: The controls can feel a little awkward to handle at first. And can take time to get used to. There isn't really a lot of attack veriety in the game such as different combos or different attacks that can be performed to add in depth of gameplay. The game feels short and can be done in about less than 2 hours. The game also has a few difficulty spikes in some parts. So going back to previous levels to grind is an option if you can't progress the next level.Above all, this is a game that deserves recognition. It's been a long wait for those who are Double Dragon fans and beat'em up fans alike and feels like a breath of fresh air. As it's the classic story, the evil syndicate steals your girl, you go out to kick their head in with your one true weapon that is your fists, and save the girl. And the evil leader who is behind all of this is...a Skellator wanna be. Who cares if it sounds out of place? This is Double Dragon, and I hope to see more of the brawler/beat'em up style gameplay continue for future games to get better and better.X3"

,Recommended,252350,16941013,"Posted: 8 July, 2015",all,somebody336,"Double Dragon Neon is a pseudo 2D beat em up in where we play Billy or Jimmy Lee on a quest to save your girlfriend from a goofy skeleton called Skullmageddon . Starting off your girlfriend gets punched in the stomach and kidnapped, that's all the story has to offer. You are able to move forward and background into the level to avoid thrown items though in certain sections it becomes pure 2D in that you are only able to move left to right. Those sections are a little less enjoyable but a far better alternate to being able to walk forward to the foreground, falling and losing some health. One unique feature that separates this game from others of the genre is that dodging attacks temporarily grants you Gleam, which allows you to cause double damage so getting in close and risking damage is a very viable tactic, so you don't just end up kiting enemies. Unfortunately it can be very picky when it counts as a dodge and a lot of times I ended up with no Gleam, which is pretty annoying considering how hard this game is until you get the hang of it.From the get go it is clear that the game was built around coop and can be difficult to tackle solo until you upgrade or simply getting better at the game. There is even a dedicated high-five your button and a floating ball that appears at the ends of levels that grant money and items, in which you must attack it to keep it afloat but it is near impossible to do. Upgrades are earned via cassette tapes that sometimes drop from defeated enemies that allows you to access special moves or change your fighting stances. Fighting stances allow you to customize your character to suit your fighting style like allowing weapons to last longer and hit harder, increasing your magic or leeching health from your enemies every time you attack them. Special moves depend on your magic bar and allows you to shoot fireballs, throw bombs and summon a dragon to damage your enemies to name a few. Magic regenerates over time though by breaking objects you can usually find a battery to refill your magic or some soda to regain some health.Money is used to buy tapes or lives from item shops that may sometimes be hidden around the level. Buying lives only lasts until the end of the level so be careful not to go crazy with buying as many as you can expecting to have a ton of lives throughout the game. Every level your life stock is reset back to two which I personally consider a flaw but does keep the game challenging. The more tapes of the same song that you have makes the ability stronger and more effective though the cap limit is 10 of a single tape until you upgrade the cap via Tapesmith. You upgrade by collecting crystals that bosses drop when defeated and each time you level up a song it increases it's cap by 10 but it does become more expensive each you upgrade. I found the addition of the Tapesmith to be unnecessary and quite frankly annoying. There was no real reason for him to be there other than to extend the replay value but it just comes off as a lazy way to keep you playing.Gameplay is pretty slow paced and tactical. You can punch, kick, use a spinning flying kick as well as a few alternate attacks by holding down either the sprint or dodge button. It does feature a grab button that can be used to throw enemies but only when stunned. It's pretty basic combat and won't impress you but it serves it's purpose. There are also multiple types of weapons to spice things up like whips, katanas and boomerangs to name a few. Guns are also in the game but only enemies can fire them as your character refuses to  shoot anyone and instead uses it to pistol whip enemies. The game has no blood and is not all that violent instead opting to go for a goofy near cartoon like approach. I wouldn't know if I'd recommend it to a child though, so I suggest looking up some gameplay beforehand if you are looking for a game to play with your kids. After a couple of levels the game does introduce way too many gimmicks where you must do some light platforming, have arrows falling out of the sky or having to be careful not to be pulled into an air vacuum.They massively overdue the environmental hazards and you will rarely have a normal fight again after the first few levels. I can't speak for everybody but I certainly don't play this genre to platform or to avoid obstacles instead of fighting people. Most of the damage caused to you will likely be due to the environments instead of a fight. I'm not saying they shouldn't include them but the amount of hazards get ridiculous further into the game you get. An example is that your character can't take a punch and will drop his weapon and be sent flying a couple of feet back which doesn't sound too bad until they introduce bottomless pits in the worst places. Fortunately it doesn't take away a life only damages you though it does feel like a cheap way of causing a lot of damage to you. Enemies will not jump over pits but will wait on the edge until you are forced to jump over which usually ends in you taking a hit and falling. It's not an enemy strategy though, the AI is quite sub-par and is only programmed to walk right to you, regardless of any hazards.Fighting enemies is still fun though as every level they either introduce a new enemies to fight or make a few visual changes like adding space helmets or turning them undead. After finishing the game you can unlock two more difficulty modes to make the game even harder and increase loot drops. A  rather large gallery of concept art is also unlocked once you finish the game which is a nice little touch. Most levels include bosses which are the best part of the game. They are absolutely insane and you will not know what to expect next. This game does not take itself seriously at all so the bosses are very creative and odd fights. Three of those boss fights will be against Skullmageddon and as goofy as he is, he is certainly no pushover. Especially in your last fight against him. That was a very fun battle that has both of you smacking each other all over the screen in a epic fight. The only thing you gain from beating them is crystals to upgrade your tapes and access to the next level. One thing that I have not mentioned is that there are keys laying in some levels that allows you to open a treasure chest further into the level. Picking it up restricts your character from punching though and you will have to rely on kicks though you can always drop it if you are not interested in the extra cash and tapes.There are only 10 levels in Double Dragon Neon so it is not a length game though it will take you quite some time to max out the tapes if you are inclined to due so. Each level is vastly different from another and usually full of color. One level did have foreground objects blocking the your view of your character but that only happened once.They are not the best visuals technically  but the artstyle for the backgrounds are stunning at times. Each level also has some new funny movements or quips from your character like seeing in enemy looking down a ledge complain about how he dropped his contacts and you can kick him off 300 style if you choose to. Kicking TVs in another level has Skullmageddon whining about how expensive they are which never fails to bring a smile to my face. Voice acting is over the top and goofy as well. Expect to hear some of the cheesiest dialogue in the history of video games. Music is simply amazing in my opinion and has a very “80's” vibe to it. Every level has a new track to show off and that became one of my biggest motivations to play level after level instead of taking a break and doing something else.  Even each Tape has it's own song which is well worth a listen instead of just picking the ability you want and quickly going back into the game.Overall it is a good game to consider for any fan of the genre and is definitely recommended for those that want a coop experience."

The first is basically a remake of the original game's first stage, but every stage after is an awesome tribute to what people liked in the 1980s and surrounding years.

I picked up the phone and said in the calmest voice I could “I'm not giving it to you. Please stop calling my home or I'll be forced to contact the authorities. I'm not afraid of you”Putting the phone back on the hook I admitted to myself that the last bit was a lie. As I trembled, holding onto the wall to keep myself from toppling over, I wondered what this bygone era want from me. Why did they feel so entitled to having Double Dragon Neon? The game clearly came out in 2012.Yet, it seemed trapped in the past in all the right ways. It seemed to exist to prove that what worked in 8 bits and dusty pizzeria arcade machines still works today. But does the great gameplay of yesteryear mean that yesteryear is entitled to having it? Our millennium earned this fair and square. I needed time to think.I laid in my bed, uneasy, shaken, crying. Fifty thousand questions and possibilities rushed through my mind. Maybe they wanted their culture back. It's a simple mistake to make, the game certainly didn't scream “2014” very loudly. Maybe it was upset that we accomplished what they couldn't. We'd made what they dreamed of but didn't have the buttons or the horsepower to accomplish, and drew too heavily from what they felt they owned. But it's ours... rightI heard a knock on my door. Trembling, I grabbed the baseball bat from under my bed and slowly walked to the front of the house. I opened the door slowly, fearfully, and saw a beast right in front of my eyes. It was six feet tall, had a rad mullet the size of a man and held a boombox so close to it's head you'd swear it grew there. It's denim jacket blew in the wind and cassette tapes jingled on it's belt. It was the 80s, and it wanted my life.I swung at the beast as hard as I could. It's tubular mass flew off of my doorstep and onto the lawn. As it slowly limped away, I heard something come from my mouth I'd hoped I'd never hear. “Far out, bro!”. At that moment I realized that I was in far deeper than I'd ever expected I would be."

Just that sometimes the controls feel unresponsive or slow.The game is really hard, the general bashing of noob characters is not so much hard, but the bosses in particular the final 2 bosses (the 2 versions of Skullmageddon) are almost painfully hard.The game can be quite unforgiving in that regard.Overall a great looking game, feels like the original in many ways, hard as balls, and worth the cheap entry fee."
76561197975017173,Recommended,252350,9163947,"Posted: 17 February, 2014",all,warlock1,"First off, I should note that the system requirements state that you need Windows 7 or 8 to play Double Dragon Neon. I've played through it quite successfully on Vista 64-bit; there was one occasion of massive slowdown during the boss of the ""genetics laboratory"" level, but that's the only hitch I've found (and I have no way of saying with certainty if that was Vista-related, just thought I should mention.)So this is Double Dragon Neon. Is it fun? Heck, yeah. Bright, colorful graphics; fantastic 80s-styled soundtrack; tight, engaging mechanics; and one of the most goofy, over-the-top senses of humor I've ever seen in an action game. If you grew up with 80s cartoons or the original, arcade DD, you owe it to yourself to at least *watch* someone play this- from the nerdish uber-boss complaining about your breaking his televisions to the Williams' full understanding of their own expendibility, this game has a ton of laugh-out-loud lines.What this is not, I should warn, is an absolutely faithful rendering of the orignal Double Dragon. The basic mechanics are similar (wander left and right, jump the occasional obstacle, use weapons, punch things), but the relative simplicity of the original's three-button controls have been replaced with a control set that uses nearly every button on a modern control stick, and you will indeed suffer for not making use of all of those controls at least some of the time. The ""dodge"" button, in particular, is absolutely essential. It's mildly frustrating that the designers chose to fiddle basic gameplay in order to *make* some of those elements essential (weapon-using henchmen ignore your hits so they can complete their swings, for example), but most modern gamers will probably appreciate the deeper controls, rather than rueing the original's relative elegance. No double-tapping to run or pressing ""punch"" to pick things up here like in some of the predecessor's contemporaries.On that line, if you *do* find the game difficult, I would advise that you 1. Practice that dodge button and 2. Look into the powers and stances buried in one of the sub-menus. Once I discovered a ""stance"" which healed Billy slightly with every hit, the game took on a whole new perspective.By and large, if you have fond memories of the original and are willing to accept a slightly steeper learning curve than you might remember from the arcade (or your home system of choice), you have a good chance of getting a good six to twelve hours of enjoyment out of DD Neon at least."

Se on myös asia missä peli hieman putoaa lyhyelle: jos sinulla ei ole kaveria jonka kanssa pelata, et tule saamaan pelistä niin paljon irti itseksesi.

The original Double Dragon was nearly mythical in it's day, as it may well have been the first game to truly stir up controversy.  For the time it was very hard edged and violent, with it's gritty urban backdrops, menacing gang members and the most visceral fighting portrayed in a game thus far...  This wasnt just martial arts fighting - you mercilessly beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people.  You beat them down with baseball bats, stabbed them with knives and gleefully punched perm-haired, spandex clad ladies in the face.  By the standards of the day, it was shockingly barbaric...  And my ten year old buddies and me were utterly and completely irrevocably enrapt.  Our parents however were aghast at it, forbidding us to play it for fear of it warping our lil heads and turning us into thugs and killers - further establishing it as forbidden fruit and making a couple bucks of allowance money spent in it's company all the more desireable.  This ♥♥♥♥er was beyond worth a good grounding over.  We'd play it, get rolled by our folks and then brag to our friends about it.  Even now It's iconic theme song and opening scene where you emerge from the garage with the red Trans-Am lurking in the background still get a few hairs on the back of my neck standing up...  It was almost like a ♥♥♥♥ing religion.  So here we are now...   27 years later, graced with this - Double Dragon Neon.  This to me is less of a re-boot and more of an homage, both to the game and the era.  The savage edge is gone, replaced with a sort of happy go lucky swagger, and loads and loads of charm.  The whole game is a tribute to the hokiness of the 80s, and it is glorious.  I swear to god, this thing makes you think ""Man, if I had a mullet and a jean vest I would seriously be cool as ♥♥♥♥!""  The music is the perfect accomplice to this being an incredible collection of redone tracks from the original game drenched in synthesizers and electric guitars, and fresh tracks that fit in perfectly, sounding for all the world like vintage 80's pop-cheese.  The art is very good, with cell shaded characters with very nice detail and facial expressions that really give them personality, all set against backdrops liberally slathered in hot pink and electric blue (lest you forget this is the 80s).  The gameplay is pretty standard beat-em up faire, and holds up fairly well, if not intuitive on the level of say Castle Crashers.  Again though, charm is the strong point here..  Sure, you beat the crap out of folks, but this is silly and cute crap beating now...  The characters all spout corny one liners and make little quips as you exchange blows that can be absurd and hilarious and make it enjoyable to wade through wave after wave of these guys.  The game's villian, apparently replacing the fairly manacing Machine Gun Willie is.... Skullmageddon. (No, really - it's his name!) and he is a particullar delight.  He taunts and heckles you in this nasally Skellator voice while you fight him, making horrid puns and one liners all the while.  It's dumb, but by god I love that guy.  It's funny to think how this tongue in cheek kung-fu romp could be descended from the bloody knuckled brutal original, but indeed the world has moved on, and I think that it is all for the better.  The original game would be considered rediculously tame by today's standards anyways, and if they were to try and reclaim the crown they once held I think the result would be dreadful.  This is for those of us who remember the shock and awe of the original game and want to enjoy a little hot neon rose colored nostalgia.  It's like a high school reunion, where no one is still trying to be badass - we have jobs and families and we want to have fun, and share some slightly skewed, over-exaggerated memories...  Ten bucks very very well spent.   Also, the fantastic soundtrack is avaliable for free on bandcamp - nice little bonus there!"

It is a game that takes itself much less seriously than the previous games. I will not compare this game to the older games because nothing will compare to the nostalgia of the old games. It would be an unfair comparison at best and I would advise you follow suit. It is a side scroller beat em up at it's finest.The Good: The game mechanics are really good. The graphics look good for what the game is suppposed to be and the effects are really nice in my opinion. The game makes fun of the 80's A LOT. Which in my opinion isn't a bad thing. There isn't much to say about it past that. It's not that there aren't many good things about it, it's that it's not a super complex game.The Bad: Glitches. Lots of glitches. Though nothing too terrible and nothing that I don't think could or should be fixed in a patch. Can't use pc gamepads without some sort of third party software. For the PS3 owners this is not a problem as MotionJoy fixes that. Xbox 360 owners also do not have a problem as the game started as an XBLA game. This is one of the few instances where I don't feel dirty after saying I played an XBLA on PC though (I'm not being an elitist when I say that. I just mean that a lot of XBLA games are gimmicky).The Ugly: Nothing really.Summary: Buy it. It's very good if you like the genre and is even better if you have a person to play with you."

I feel like the hit detection is bit of a miss in this game and something that seriously could be improved. The humour in this game is not even retro its just plain horrible. The main villains voice acting is one of the worst things about this game and when your own character utters the line ""I double dragon dare you"", your stomach kind of churns a bit and you vomit inside your own throat.

I hadn't picked it up since until I got a hankering to play a side scrolling beat-em-up and I decided to go back and finish this game, and, kinda like my joke review implied, this game is an unapologetic love letter to the 80s, to the extent that the game pretty much is Double Dragon HD: I Love The 80s Edition, as everything from the neon and bright color aesthetic to the fact that the main villain is clearly inspired by Skeletor is a shoutout to the 80s.But you don't play video games for aesthetics, you play for the gameplay....mostly....and I can say that if you're a fan of beat-em-ups from the 80s and 90s you'll feel right at home here. For the most part the Lee Brothers control fine, if a little floaty and a little slow, but that isn't much of an issue since most of the game is designed around the slower movement speed, including enemy placement and frequency. You'll note that I said, most of the game is designed like that.This means that there are a few moments where, though ""gittin gud"" really is the only way to beat the game's 10 stages, sometimes the game wants to be faster-paced than your characters really are capable of dealing with. Also it does take some cues from its coin-operated older brothers in that the bosses, particularly the final boss, seem designed to eat your quarters with how much damage they can deal.But that's all offset by infinite continues, with the only real setback being you have to replay the level. This will be kind of discouraging, and might result in a few thrown controllers (please don't throw your keyboard or laptop), but since the game saves at each stage AND what upgrades you get through the game's Mixtape system, these setbacks are more annoying than particularly gamebreaking, and with some dedication you'll eventually get it.Bottom line, should you buy this game? Well, the only way to answer that is by answering whether or not you like beat-em-ups in the first place. If yes, then yes, buy it. If no, this probably won't make a believer out of you, but if you're curious, get it on sale.Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome. Just throwing that in there."

The reason why I'm choosing thumbs down as my official score though, is because of how horrid its multiplayer connection is. So TL;DR - if you're playing single player, you'll have some fun. But most people will be trying to get this game for coop since it's advertised as a coop game. And to them, I say: If you want couch coop, you should be fine. But online? Run away. Run far, far away.That said, onto the bullet points.+ Clean, crisp graphics+ Fun and lively characters/enemies+ Awesome 80's era imagery and dialogue+ Relatively straightforward beat em up, can't really go wrong if that's what you're looking for+ Varied power ups and abilities+ IF YOU DON'T PLAY ONLINE, 2 player coop is what makes the game shine. Alot of mechanics (including high five power ups and ""resurrecting"" your ""bro"") open up.+ If you're solo you can turn on a ""bro bot"".+ Challenging. This isn't an easy game.- ONLINE MULTIPLAYER IS BAD. At least, when it came to my experience. Stuttering lag, desyncing, disconnects every few minutes, crashes...everything you can think of, it happened. I bought this game for both myself and a friend, and I'm currently regretting it.- Online latency can basically ruin Adobo fights and those that need you to dodge quickly. One of their main things is interrupting your combo with a hammer fist like attack. This attack gives just enough time and just enough of a tell to give you a chance to dodge out of the way. But online....nope. You will get hit. Every time. You're forced to use other tactics and so far I haven't found one that works well enough online. Of course, keep in mind my meager amount of hours in this game. I could just be showing off my newbieness.- Battle mechanics are noticeably much different than the older Double Dragons.- Running is....odd. Your character winds up and then starts running, which can lead to completely messing you up in all sorts of ways. There are certain mechanics that need you to run away or quickly get under some sort of cover. If you time it like you would any other game with running mechanics, prepare to find yourself on the floor.- There is no grab and knee to face. Why did they not add this? That was a staple in many of the double dragon games. It feels as if a large chunk of the soul of double dragon was ripped out of it.- enemies can juggle you pretty much indefinitely. I do love a challenge but it can get obnoxious, especially since enemies do a considerable amount of damage to you per hit.- enemies are also invulnerable when they're swinging a weapon at you. So if you try to interrupt an enemy that's wielding a knife, prepare to get hit anyway, and watch 1/3rd of your life disappear in one hit.So...yeah. I want to really really like this game and I guess if I play the rest of it solo, I probably will like it. But as stated in the beginning, the main reason why people are going to buy this game is due to the desire to play with friends. If it fails on that level, then the game fails almost completely in my eyes.Play solo? Go for it. Play couch coop? Go for it (if you want two controllers you'll have to look up how to get that to work. Supposedly it only works with one controller by default). Play online? No. Nonononono. You can try. You might have a better time than I. But I can only go with my own experience, and that experience says...no."

It is artisically sound and the gameplay is a lot more larger than the older versions.  Never once did I feel that it wasn't a part of the franchise.  To me it felt like how a modern Double Dragon should be.  I give this a thumbs up for most everything involved from storyline to the 80s cinematic cheese they presented in with the neat little package of added features like songs(powerups) and the small variance on the classic Double Dragon arcade side-scrolling beat em' ups.  The negatives I noticed where small but do matter:  Multiplayer online seems to be a ghost town and I had to configure the .ini file to get the controller on player 1 working correctly.

You can't just shut off Steam or turn it off on the task bar, stream waits for the game to shut down (which it never does) before closing, and with the task bar option Steam keeps it running. This happened to me on levels 6, and 9, levels with falling arrows very much don't like it when the falling arrows hit something. The community has found a work around for this problem. You'll have to open your task manager and right click on the game > set affinity and set it to only run on 1 core, this should fix it. Thanks to the community, seeing how the dev team knew about this for quite a while with zero feedback on fixing it.Risk it if you want, it is a fun and solid game when it works, try applying the work around if you hit the freezing problem. You will have to do it after restarting the game but it might be the help you need. Also remember it's pretty much unplayable on a win 10 machine, wish I could also say something about win8 but I don't have an 8 box."

It's a little slow, but the controls are tight and the move & ability customization is solid. The levels never feel like they over stay their welcome, I like the art style, and the humor is smartly stupid.As a semi-sequel or reboot to Double Dragon, I still like it, but I find it really weird. Double Dragon was never about humor, so it seems weird that humor is at the forefront of Neon. It's a parody of not only Double Dragon but the 80's culture, with jabs at other video games and a fantastical villian.Regardless, Neon is still an excellent game that I will probably replay on harder difficulties, which is not something I do often."

Secondly when there are too many enemies on screen the framerate really suffers.It is obvious that they have ported this from either ps3 or xbox360 & it really does show because a little game like this shouldn't have those issues.With that being said is it worth the Ten dollars. If you haven't played it yet I would say even with the problems absolutely  it is worth the ten dollars.For those that have it on ps3 or 360 & can wait to play it on pc. I would wait till they iron out the bugs & at least give us the settings to change.

The controls are unresponsive and sluggish, just like in the 90s. The hitboxes are hilarious. The dodge roll doesn't work half of the time, because you are animation locked and the game doesn't even run well on a modern PC, while it has no right to be so hardware demanding. It doesn't look that good to justify that. The cutscenes cannot be skipped and when you're out of lives you have to restart the entire level. Have fun dying to the first boss, because you have no idea when he is going to attack and when you can safely hit him, because only the special attacks are highlighted well. Also it takes forever to beat him down. Enemies in general are very boring and it is annoying when you dodge INTO a kick (although you are clearly dodging)...I recognize I might not be very good at the game, but still, it definitely got flaws and is not worth the asking price imho.

Apparently its very difficult, this game is slow and hitting anyone is very difficult.  Even in areas where you cant move up and down, you may end up just punching the air like an idiot.  The enemies can just strike and hit you almost anywhere but to hit them you need pixel perfect accuracy making it feel like the computer is using cheats.  If an enemy starts an animation for attacking there is no way to stop it.  When an enemy appears on screen such as the geisha girls their invulnerable until they attack, leaving you to stand there like an idiot waiting for their attack, in a game about action, waiting is never fun, matter of fact it kills it with these silly rules the devs made.  Worse is enemies can move off screen where you cant see them, they can just stand there infinitely hurling things at you.  Often during a battle you will move somewhere to attack an enemy only to have a barrage of stuff come out of nowhere from the other side where an enemy appeared you didnt even know was there.*This game suffers from horrible crashes very often, with no save points it means starting levels all over.  Also the game runs real slow, devs have tried patching it but so far the problem remainsMaybe for a game like this we need 3 or maybe 4 titan cards.Rating:  2/10  Value:  $1.99"

Art is decent, but don't pay full price for this. My suggestion is to check out the dark arts of retro console emulation if your fat, domineering wife has thrown out all your old hardware."

The game is relatively short too, so you can blaze through it by yourself, or even better, with a bro at your side. Skull-maggedon is the best villian I've come across in a long time. His plan is straight forward, he made me laugh, he had hidden jokes in his boss fight (possible unintentional 'Face/Off reference in one of his attacks or I read too deep into that), and his ending is one I won't forget. But, alas, this game is short, like the original. It took me roughly 3 hours to beat the game, and I'm tempted to ask my bro to play with me on a harder difficulty.

Having now played and beat Normal difficulty on Steam, with Online Co-Op, I love it even more.  The nostalgia I get from this game is great, with the level design, the enemy AI, the controls, and the superb soundtrack, this game easily takes me back to my favorite Double Dragon games: 1, 2, and Super Double Dragon.  I was thrilled I got to play Online Co-Op (with a random person), since the PS3 version left out this key element.  I guess I have to say thank you to whoever it was I played with, for helping to make the experience that much more enjoyable.In my 2.7 hrs of play, I think I was fortunate to not have encountered any of the major bugs posted in other players' comments, though there was one bug in which the game froze while transitioning from one area to another.  I forget what stage # it was, maybe 8...?  But it was the stage where after Billy and Jimmy ride down a long slide in a plant creature's lower jaw, they land in a graveyard-type area and fight undead characters.  I had to return to the map and restart the stage, and the problem never occurred again.  There was also some brief choppiness on some stages, but only lasted for a second or two.Highly recommend this game to any hardcore Double Dragon fan, and anyone looking for that old school, fun brawler feel in a game.10/10 = Incredibly fun new take on a classic brawler, even with the bug and slight choppiness I mentioned above.System: Windows 8, GeForce GTX960"

You'll see a lot fo comments saying comparing it to retro brawlers but honestly, I disagree. ""Brutal but fair"" is a better description, considering how old beat-em-ups were focused on unfairly eating your quarters. Compared to a more chaotic game like Castle Crashers, DD:Neon is more slow paced. Time your dodges, counter effectively, and it ends up being a more rewarding type of combat. Think Street Fighter's pace vs MvC3's spamminess, if you're into fighters.It's also well balanced between co-op and single player. When you're solo, the bosses and enemies slow down a little, use stricter patterns. In co-op, everything is dialed up and harder, but you've got your buddy so it's all good. My brother and I managed to beat the game just fine on the hardest setting, so don't let 'retro' difficulty intimidate you, just play carefullly.All the comments about music and aesthetics are true. It's just a fun throwback to late 80s/early 90s big city/scifi type cartoons. I'm hoping for sequels just for more Skullmageddon."

The story is simple but awesome - and I can't help at chuckle at parts of the dialogue.

Now, for the muliplayer review:Whoever designed the co-op mode's connection system is an idiot of the highest order and I hope he or she has to suffer trying to play this hunk of garbage as Player 2 for eternity.  I bought the game for my friend even though I'm tight on cash right now since I'm moving, thinking it would be worth it.  Guess what?  It isn't.  All the fun I expected to have with my bro will probably never happen because I'm experiencing the worst lag I think I've ever experienced since I began PC gaming circa 1999.  Trying to revive him is a nightmare and he usually ends up dying because while trying to position myself over his corpse, I take three or four extra steps and end up elsewhere.  For a game series that has always relied on skill and timing and made you feel accomplished when you could get through the games with only one or two lives lost (or as is my personal case with Super Double Dragon IV for the SNES, zero lives lost - try it, it's fun!), this was a real downer.  Again, I recommend this game fully for its single player mode.  Great 80's feel, awesome music, and just the right amount of grinding to become powerful.... but if you happen to be reading this and you're planning on paying good money for the co-op mode, don't bother.

,Not Recommended,252350,18951869,"Posted: 8 November, 2015",all,MrVariant,"This game is fundamentally broken.  There is no easy mode which could have been good with checkpoints.  Furthermore, Wayforward has made broken games (without fixing, so we have to call them Way Backward) between level 3 crashing in this game and from what I heard, the final level in Ducktales (I got too disgusted by the enemy health to bother finishing that game). Onto the review of what actually works.There is wasted potential in Double Dragon Neon. There are a lot of moves to unlock, but unfortunately, the interface is godawful.  There is no way anyone would know to press tab to shift between menus for customizing controls. For example, Space is jump and M is default for special moves (not explained in the horrible tutorial) whereas the other keyboard controls are on the left: Z-punch, X kick, Left Shift- dash, left ctrl to duck for dodging. I liked the music idea (of collecting cd's and hearing a song in that special moves/stances (stances are a customizable way for stat growth) menu by pressing T) though a soundtrack would have been nice to have in options.Furthermore, this game is Double Dragon 3 hard.  It was an accomplishment for me to make it past the 1st level.  However, it's because you have to master dodging. The risk/reward mechanic is kinda good but annoying to get past regular enemies sometimes, especially when enemies find themselves just outside your punching range, though kicks help fix that issue.  I felt it was nearly unplayable until I got the fireball in the 2nd level as these guys can take a beating and having to constantly gleam (dodge at the right time to get more attack) can be a chore if you prefer beat 'em ups where you can just button mash or rush enemies.Now at level 2 with the fireball, the game gets to be fun.  However, again they drop the ball by not allowing the stores to be accessible from the stage map. You have to visit the stores and buy extra lives and upgrade moves. I barely beat this level but it felt like I got a lot better.  Unfortunately, the game crashes at level 3 (on windows 10), making it a broken game only worth trying when it was on a $1 sale."

So I can personally atest that its popularity isn't strictly due to nostalgia.Now I will say that you may get immediately turned off when you get owned on the first level, and near as you can tell you didn't do anything wrong. But give it a chance and you won't regret it. Giving it a chance in this case meaning set a mix tape for your stats and special attack. Also be sure to remember to use your special attack. Do that and dodge a little and you'll get it.But once you get what the game is going for it is amazing. Suddenly you find yourself really getting into it. The story is ludicrously over the top and thus amazing.This game is flawless though. The controls can feel a tad unresponsive at times and I did encounter a glitch that forced me to restart a level. Neither of these should majorly interfere with your enjoyment of the game however."

I know that's not a lot, but I want to make one thing abundantly clear about the genius design of this game.First, yes this is Double Dragon via Wayforward's goofy sense of humour. The moment you start the game up you are battered with screaming 80s nostalgia and Double Dragon injokes and a game which clearly refuses outright to take itself seriously. AND THIS IS IN NO WAY A BAD THING.Let's be honest, Double Dragon is a product of its time. It has no business being a modern remake. If Ubisoft or EA or whoever did this, it'd be trash. It'd be like Duke Nukem Forever. Highly anticipated, woefully disappointing and a slap in the face to our memories. Wayforward KNOW this. So they jacked the game up to 11. Neon is in no way just a fun catchword. It is the SOUL of this game. Everything from the music to the character designs to the one-liners and the first boss (and probably bosses beyond that!) SMACKS of 80s ethos and design. It's nostalgic in the best way: It reminds you of all that was great when you look at the past with those rose tinted glasses, AND pokes fun at how bloody ridiculous it all actually is. It makes you laugh at it and yourself and also warms your heart with the reminder of how things used to be, and the ACTUALLY FUN things about it too.The second most important thing about this game's genius design is how SLUGGISH everything feels. I remember playing the Streets of Rage and Final Fight series and marvelling at how quick and responsive everything was. Moves fired off nearly immediately and combat was straightforward but detailed enough to be entertaining, especially as both series expanded.What struck me immediately upon playing this game was every movement has a lead-up time. Running, every attack, each attack feels slowed down and has a big tell, and more importantly, that it's GLOBAL. It affects EVERY character in the game, enemies included. Every attack still feels like it hits hard and has a lot of weight, mostly due to great sound design and the effects displayed, but everything was over the top and had huge tells to it. Then it struck me as to why this is a genius design decision. Because of the ducking/dodge mechanic, this means that you have time to counter-attack, time to know what's about to hit so you can react accordingly. Rather than it being a twitch-game, you actually get to think about how you're going to attack an opponent. You can learn their 'tells' and counter them effectively. It balances out the brutal difficulty with ACTUAL SKILL. You can no longer just face an enemy and hammer the attacks repeatedly and hope for the best. Now you can actually learn to dodge and counter opponents, stun them to lead up for throws which will topple other foes so they don't flank you, you learn new moves and special attacks which allow you to deal huge damage and counter other special attacks, weapons have their own unique abilities and are suitable in different situations...These two points alone make Double Dragon Neon far more than just a cheeky, fun, silly remake, but turn it into a very well designed game IN ITS OWN RIGHT. If it wasn't Double Dragon, it would still be a fantastic sidescroller beat'em up. For this alone, despite the short amount of time I've played it, I recommend it.Great fun, very much tongue-in-cheek, and if you are a child of the 80s the first boss will have you in stitches."

Once you start getting into the swing of the game and its eccentricities, you'll know exactly why certain creative decisions were made. This game was clearly designed as a reboot which emphasizes on the martial arts craze during the 80s and 90s, the toy-advertising cartoons with cheesy villians with even cheesier voices, the prevelance of synthesized pop music and the visuals of 80s neon lights. Everything from the visuals, the music and the dialogue are brilliantly done to the point that you'll feel more than a touch of nostalgia from it.The controls are solid, with the slight delay in attacking a nod to the original game's attack-lag, meaning combat needs to be thought-out. The old system of exploiting patterns to win battles is still there, but the difficulty is still intact, particularly for Double Dragon difficulty. The RPG system of building up stats and powering up special abilities and attacks is a great touch which gives players a few extra options in how they want to approach combat.I would highly recommend this beat 'em up to anyone looking for an entertaining jaunt through the 80s."

For instance, if your main display is like mine, and 1920x1080, with your old monitor as secondary and running 1680x1050 the game seems to only want to run @ the lower of the two.

Double Dragon: Neon has done nothing to change that.The graphics are an appreciated step up from other Double Dragon games, but the animations needed to make all of those work make the fighting feel laggy and unresponsive. Sure, I can see the enemies attack coming, but I'm stuck in one of my own attack animations so I can't dodge it. Not to mention, even in the 80's, the only characters I can think of who start running like that are Shaggy and Scooby Doo. It really makes walking feel faster than running to have to watch that animation every time, even when my finger meerly slips off the button.The dialog and voice acting give the game a zany 80s feel that I like in games, but I never have been a fan of games that mock you for not being GODLIKE at them. Enemies laugh and mock you whenever they knock you down, and Skullmageddon, the antagonist, will ask ""Why is this taking so long?"" if you aren't killing him quickly.

In other words, you've had every opportunity to own this game in some form or another.When I first saw screenshotse for Double Dragon Neon, I immediately cringed and thought of the abomination that was Turtles in Time Reshelled. Upon firing it up, it was a relief that graphics were the only thing it had in common. Double Dragon Neon is a fun take on the series, with the 80s style turned up to 11 and an engine that actually makes it enjoyable to play. It's nothing ground-breaking, but it's still A LOT of fun to play.You have a system that revolves around mixtapes, which grant you a boost to certain stats (such as power, defense, magic, etc), or allow your character to use special abilities, such as throwing fireballs, healing, or summoning dragons to crush every enemy on screen. You level up your mixtapes by collecting any that fall from enemies, or you can purchase them in store with money you collect from enemies. Once you max out your mixtape, you will want to visit a tapesmith to upgrade how many you can hold, which will further develop your stats.And you'll need it. The game, while not terribly difficult, can be unforgiving for players wishing to play it like the 1980s classic and just mash out buttons. You have new abilities, such as duck, dodge, and rolling that you MUST learn to use in order to evade enemies and set yourself up to kill them without being hit. If you successfully dodge an attack, your character will gleam, which grants a bonus to your attack. Learning how each enemy attacks and what the best method of disposing of them keeps the game fresh, and fun. You may want to switch your mixtape stance to offer more defense in a particular area, or you may want to boost your magic to fight at a distance. Half the fun is figuring everything out and grinding to upgrade your stats (although non-RPG fans may not find the latter very fun).Is Double Dragon Neon the best in the series? I think so (although the GBA versions are very good). Is it ground-breaking like the original? Not so much. But it's fun. Grab a friend for even more craziness.8/10"

It brings the Double Dragon Series into updated graphics and adds tons of unlockables and moves that add to the strong gameplay.  The music is half remixes and half new.  The new music is mostly 80's style vocal stuff, and it's not that great.  Its purpose is to add to the overall charm of the game.  DDN is an over-the-top game by far, with you destroying tanks with your bare hands, ripping apart biological weapons and then riding the remains down a cliff.  The voice-acting is also hilarious at times, with the ""Bad Women"" saying suggestive lines like ""On your knees, please!"" and ""Punish me!"".  Also notable is Skullmageddon, the new antagonist.  He has a high nasal voice and constantly  gives orders to his goons throughout the game in the most cocky tone imaginable.  His entire purpose is to add to the ""So bad that it's good"" vibe that this game gives off.  I noticed a considerable amount of slowdown when playing the game throughout, but it isn't horrible.  It's by no means fast-paced, and I recommend the Ps3 or Xbox 360 version if possible, but this version is still very enjoyable for a Double Dragon fan.  If you haven't played a Double Dragon or Beat-em up game before, you won't understand most of the inside jokes within the game.  If you like the genre and/or series, pick this game up, otherwise you just won't enjoy it that much. 7/10 Overall Score."

My initial experience to the game was that it felt slow but what can you do? It's not exactly a traditional sprite based beat'em up with attack wind ups to make the attacks look smoother. Actually, the speed is appropriate for some of the gameplay mechanics to function properly (gleam).Initially, in the first difficulty setting you may not understand the game fully even with the in game tutorials. DDN encourages crouching an avoidable attack to gain attack bonuses so that you can take out enemies more efficiently. You'll undoubtedly acquire mixtapes from enemies to either have stat bonuses or a special attack that uses up meter. You'll get to have 2 tapes on max (one special attack and one stats booster).By the time I reached the later difficulties my experience when playing the game was at its max. My character's stats were appropriate to the difficulty and the game became fair and less frustrating. It's up to you to get good at the game and enjoy its quirky 80's aesthetics.

The art style, music, and other elements are heavily inspired by the decade that brought us the original game.  One special move called the ""Bro-Dozer"" has a theme tune reminiscent of Kylie Minogue's cover of ""The Locomotion"".  The voice of the game's main villain closely resembles that of Skeletor from Filmation's animated MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE series.  The game even pokes fun at the concept of the ""load-bearing boss"".Nostalgia aside, the game is fun, if a bit challenging.  Special moves and abilities can be acquired by collecting ""mixtapes"" (another nod to 80s music culture).  Collecting extras of a given tape increase the power of that special move/ability.  After several plays, you'll become powerful enough to beat the first boss and collect chunks of ""Mithril"", an ore that allows further upgrades of mixtape abilities.  This means that a little bit of backtracking and level grinding is needed to power up enough to survive the final battle.

If you grew up in the 80s and 90s, then you'll appreciate a lot about this game; everything from the blatant references to that era, to the way it plays, it's just a giant love letter to simpler times. I've seen a lot of reviews from journo sites that write the game off as not being appealing or being too repetitive, and I can see how that may make sense from the perspective of someone who isn't familiar with the property or what this individual title represents. The truth of the matter is, it might not be for everyone, and I can accept that. But you have to give credit where it's due, and WayForward have outdone themselves on this title to make it shine the way it does.If you're a fan of old school beat 'em ups, love tongue in cheek humour and references to pop culture from the 80s, then you'll enjoy this game.

I also noticed that a friend on my list had this on their wishlist, so I bought it for them too.  I also asked a few others if they wanted a copy, so I got them that as well.  Anyhow, I've had a lot of fun with this game, and I feel it has the right balance of difficulty and skill ceiling, since it forces you to adapt to the game's mechanics early on, unless you wish to keep getting beaten on.  Plus the game has upgradable stance and technique ""mixtapes,"" and these carry over in the New Game+, definitely increasing the game's replayability.  However, it is not without some issues, as I will detail below.I bought four copies of game, although it was on sale for a buck.  I want to say ""Sorry WayForward!"" but the game has two technical issues that make the game into a royal pain, and have never been addressed.  Typical of a ""dump and forget"" console-to-PC port.  One issue that's quite common is the game suffering from memory leaking, which in turn causes the game to stutter a lot as time goes on.  Since it is a 32-bit program, I've decided to use Large Address Aware and make it use more memory, should it start leaking again, and buy you some more time.  Alternatively, just exit the game and restart it, as inconvenient as it may be.The second issue is that the game can and will randomly freeze at certain points of the game, in my personal experience it was in Stage 9, when the arrows were falling from the sky.  One fix people used was to open task manager as the game was running, and setting CPU affinity to only use one core.  I did this and encountered no freezing, though it could've also been a coincidence.I've also heard issues with the netcode/online multiplayer aspect, but I cannot comment on this since I have not played co-op with anyone yet.  And this game, while it supports keyboards, plays MUCH better with a controller, preferably an Xbox controller.All in all, do I reccomend this game?  Well, considering these issues, I want to say ""wait for a sale"" since I can't guarantee what I did will also help others who may experience these issues.  But if the game had no issues, then this is easily worth the 10 bucks they are normally asking for it.edit:  gimme reward pl0x"

The combat is enjoyable and fluid, easy to get into but with some technique that can be improved upon as you grow as a player. The game is as 80's as it could possibly be in every conceivable way, and the music, while purposefully cheesy, is amazingly well done.I can't recommend this game enough if you get a kick out of cheesy 80's tropes, or beat 'em ups in general."
,Recommended,252350,14087645,"Posted: 20 January, 2015",all,Bad Man Xaldy,"Double Dragon: Neon is an absolutely fantastic video game.Double Dragon: Neon is everything it wants to be. Not only is the gameplay satisfying, but it also delivers spectacularly with the soundtrack, forged by the man Jake Kaufman himself. This game is wonderfully tongue-in-cheek while also paying homage to the earlier games of the series. Now, while I want to call this game perfect in every respect, it sadly isn't. However, I still feel very passionate about just how great Double Dragon: Neon is.Now as you all probably know, this game is a sidescrolling beat 'em up with co-op capability, and it's great. The gameplay has a decent sense of depth for a 2-D beat 'em up since you are given the ability to dodge and perform combos with a bro. The sound effects are all robust and clear and really give you the sense that you are beating the living daylights out of someone. The voice acting and kind of humor this game has are both delightfully silly. And to top it all off, the hype soundtrack is not only fitting for this game, but it's also available for a free download. This game is just bodacious-- and for only $10!The bro-op really is just boss, by the way. Juggling your opponents together to utterly annihilate them, the high-five mechanic that allows you to split health or give each other double damage, and sharing (or fighting over) money and healing items. It's friggin' bro-op.Now I could go on and continue singing this game's praises, but it does have a couple issues. The netplay leaves much to be desired, and the game is capable of stuttering and crashing. I personally have not consistently experienced the latter, but they are definitely issues that have needed to be ironed out. Fighting Roxy, that jetpack girl, is also pretty bogus. That last part doesn't really matter, though.Now this part of the gameplay here you may love or hate, as it is quite different from the other Double Dragon games. As you progress through the game, you'll grab these nifty little upgrades called Mixtapes. These are, in essence, how you level up your Billy (or Jimmy) to make him stronger. You can equip two different Mixtapes at any time: One of your Mixtapes will be stance which boosts your stats passively, some of the stances having unique effect on gameplay. The other will be your Sosetsuken, otherwise known as your special attack. Grabbing more of the same Mixtape will enhance it, making it more powerful. In addition, you can actually upgrade the maximum strength of your Mixtapes at the Tapesmith. This all adds a sort of RPG feel to the game, which I personally have no issue with. If you feel like the Mixtape system cheapens the game, don't worry! The harder difficulties will still prove challenging even with a maxed out Mixtape.Even with this game's issues, I would absolutely reccommend this game. It really is a solid game that's even better with a bro. Or you could buy Nekopara, I guess. If you're a dweeb."

,Recommended,252350,28576504,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,Baloo,"Bro-Tacular is the only way to describe Double Dragon Neon. This homage to the 80s has successfully put a new coat of paint on a tried-and-true gameplay style, and oozes replayability. Jimmy and Billy Lee have to save Marion as she is captured by the evil Skullmageddon. (""Skeletor has nothing on me!"") Billy and Jimmy bust through through ten stages of neon awesomeness, complete with ""Bro-op"" gameplay, Bro-ver the top puns, and air guitar. Neon is a real love letter to the franchise, the genre, and the decade that spawned it, culminating in a fantastic game.The gameplay is crisp and varied, but plays just the way you want an old-school beat-em-up to. Neon doesn't do anything fancy to try to change the gameplay from its predecessors, while drawing upon other legends of the genre, like Streets of Rage 2 and Guardian Heroes. Players punch and kick their way through generous amounts of baddies, the likes of which include geishas, flying robots, and everyone's favorite beat-em-up staple: Dominatrixes. Jimmy and Billy pick up ""mixtapes"" along the way containing different special moves (called ""Magic"") and stances that allow for on-the-fly changes of special moves that cater the enemy situation. Each mixtape even has its own 30-second music clip on the select screen, adding to the charm. Special move usage is dictated by a lightning bar, recharged by killing enemies. Billy and Jimmy also acquire stat upgrades along the way in the form of stances, giving the game a bit of RPG-flair akin to Treasure's 1996 Sega Saturn exclusive Guardian Heroes. The stances allow you to focus on which Money collected from enemies also allow you to buy upgrades to your mixtapes in different shops found in the game.But what would a beat-em-up be without great co-op gameplay? Also included in Neon are a Bro-mantic Hi-Five feature that enables power-ups and life sharing during gameplay, as well as a possible rewind technique by your partner upon losing all of your health, both of which enhance the the game's ""Bro-op"" feel to the point that Double Dragon Neon feels empty and frustrating without a buddy, an experience I wouldn't recommend. Both local and online co-op are possible, which gives the game a lot of flexibility to be played with friends, whether they're in your presence or not. My only gripe with Neon is it's length, being a relatively short ten levels. However, the game's formidable difficulty and great gameplay lends itself to great replay value, which makes it easy to overlook.The graphics are slick! Everything is in 2D and has a great hand-drawn look to it. Backgrounds are distinct and colorful, and  and the music perfectly matches the 80s theme, with synth-hits and guitar riffs reminiscent of your Dad's old Devo vinyl. The soundtrack is great enough to stand on its own, and I recommend a download of it here:http://virt.bandcamp.com/album/double-dragon-neon.The PC port of Neon does everything you want it to, being fairly easy to run on less-powerful computers, while still looking great. Neon also has native controller support. However, this is limited to the Xbox 360 controller, and the game does not allow for control remapping, a slight misstep for anyone without a 360 USB controller.At $10 MSRP (Or less if you're patient enough, I picked it up for $3.75 during the last Steam Summer Sale), I heartily recommend WayForward's reboot of the notable beat-em-up series. Double Dragon Neon hits the mark on all fronts. Totally Radical Dude!"

Having grown up with the NES and SNES Double Dragon series, I was coming into this game with high expectations.Double Dragon: Neon is a beat 'em up game which was released in 2012. The PC version offers various resolutions, and offers very smooth 60 fps beautiful cell shaded animation and graphics. The soundtrack here is probably the best original score for its release back in 2012, and offers throwbacks to the 80's with very catchy lyrics accompanied by synthesizers and drum machine beats.Game's tone is different from prior games in the franchise, at first It was frustrating, but the game did get more than a few laughs out of me. There are plenty of Easter eggs and references to 80s-90s games and culture. The music is good and the game mechanism is simple and easy to master.I would simply say that this a modern remake of a classic beat 'em up game with everything done right!"

,Recommended,252350,30338066,Posted: 5 March,all,BrandSilven,"First things first: Are you a big fan of the previous Double Dragon games? Did you grow up playing them and enjoying them? Well, Double Dragon: Neon is just a bit different. Just here to set expectations. Is Neon a Double Dragon game? Yes and no. It has the basics of a Double Dragon game, some of the same music, same main characters (in at least name), but if this had been released as ""Dual Drakes: A Double Dragon Parody"" it would have worked just as well. If you get the game expecting a Double Dragon parody with overblown 80's stereotypes, as well as broadly painted stereotypes of enemies (including a big bad guy who sounds exactly like Skeletor from He-Man), you'll probably love the game.There are some things to note: The game has a rudimentary leveling system, where replaying levels over and over are required to get the most out of skills. You may not need to do this, but it does make the game easier. You'll run into invulnerability frames on enemy attacks. Meaning, if you're punching a guy in the face and he decides to do one of his long windup telegraphed attacks, he'll take no damage or stagger from your attack and you'll get hit instead without anything you can really do about it. Yeah, it can be kinda cheap getting hit even though you had better position and timing.So, I do recommend the game. If you're expecting something that takes itself a bit more seriously, like the previous Double Dragon games, you may be a bit disappointed. Just be aware of what you're getting and you'll be fine."

I only watched that one oh-so-cheesy Double Dragon film back then on VHS.Anyway, this game contains (who would have though it?) references to the 80s era: Synthie pop, rock, neon colors, old-skool arcade style brawling and a villain who's obviously a reference to Skeletor from the Masters of the Universe franchise.Maybeeeee there could been more villains to beat up, some characters return over and over again.It's even more fun playing it in online co-op mode, so make sure you find someone in the community to join with.If there'd be a sequel one day, I'd consider to add it to my collection."

Back in the day, so many greater companies were producing those as one of their main pillar of income. Nowadays, we have indies to hold up the torch, sometimes even with a sprinkle of innovation.This game though has some innovation, is of an old-school franchise, is executed with some serious talent behind it and doesn't compromise. Tis a brogame, man.You now can chose and upgrade special skills, which is the main innovation behind DDN, and it's fairly well executed. The only thing I dislike a bit is the slow movement, but I barely play any brawlers anymore, so maybe that's a point that's modern.It's a really good game and seems to be real fun in coop, but I had no opportunity to try this out.The technical aspect of this port seems to hold up eventually. Thank god."
