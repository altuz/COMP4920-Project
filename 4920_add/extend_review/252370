Or if you die and need to load a save, you have to sit through it AGAIN before you can get to the load menu.--Final confrontation feels a little too trial and error.--UI/HUD elements feel a bit rough.--Extreeemely short.Likes:--A rabbi having a crisis of faith is a character type I've never played before, and judaism more generally is a theme I've never played before, so I was very happy playing as a new type of protagonist in a new type of backdrop.--Two cameos from Rosa Blackwell!!! And a cameo from Sam Durkin!!! Also, the apartment that the Lauders live in is Emil's apartment from Blackwell Epiphany! I LOVE IT!!!--I like that the game has ""moral choices"", but that choices are not intended to be a question of whether you (i.e. Rabbi Stone) are good or evil (you're a good guy no matter what), but more a question of faith and principles. You're not just choosing between good/evil or goodcop/badcop. You're choosing between the human response and the faith response. Because you/Stone are depicted as having a crisis of faith and are therefore sitting on the fence in this regard, both choices make perfect sense and seem equally acceptable. It feels less like the game is judging your choice than it often does with the blunt good/evil type scenarios you usually get. And when I say ""crisis of faith"", it's not that Rabbi Stone is becoming an atheist or anything like that. It's not that kind of crisis of faith. He's just reached a point where he's unhappy with his life and starts to feel that his faith is not getting him anywhere, so he's having trouble putting his faith in god's will instead of his own. So your ""moral choices"" are a choice between giving a situation to god's will or giving a situation to your own will. I like that this gives the moral decisions a slightly different flavor than usual and it's something I wish would have been even more pronounced. (Although I am not religious myself, I still found this very interesting in character exploration terms.)--In the final encounter, I was impressed with how many different outcomes that encounter could have depending on the choices you make in that scene and the choices you made in earlier scenes. I was also extremely shocked and saddened with one particular outcome of one particular choice.... daaaaang that was harsh. Fortunately I was able to avoid it on another attempt. Whew.Final Thoughts:While it didn't quite blow my mind the way that the Blackwell games did, it was an interesting new character and subject, and looking at moral choices through the lens of a crisis of faith was a kinda refreshing take on a tired old gaming trope."

It delivers this dialog in the context of a murder mystery that is told in a way that only a game could. The game oozes with atomosphere not only through it's art and sound design, but also its writing and puzzle design.

I ended up using a walkthrough to find out the solution and it was not at all clear how you were ever supposed to know that information.- The final segment of the game is tedous. You can't save during it, and if you fail you have to watch the opening scene animation all over again, then hit space bar a million times after you've loaded the most recent game to skip through dialogue you've already read. I think I had to do that 5-6 times before I was able to beat the game properly.Having said all that, the subject matter of the game was very unique, and even though I'm not Jewish I found it refreshing and interesting.

Nothing big but I like that.For me the real drawbacks are the length of the game, like I said, and the fact that it's a little out of reach, since it has jewish elements and I can't say if some things are for real or not and can be a little hard to get into it unlike, say, Deponia and their comedic settings.

In what other game can you play as a down-on-his-luck rabbi? This opens room for all kinds of conflicts you can't find anywhere else, and The Shivah takes advantage of its unique angle, even though the story doesn't turn out to be anything spectacular. The game's creator, Dave Gilbert, has a bad habit of writing great down to earth, slice of life stories (as he did as well in the Blackwell series) that culminate in ridiculous situations which are a far cry from the relatable realism we see in the beginning. It was hard for me to take the final climax that seriously and I was disappointed that Rabbi Stone showed little to no character development.If you enjoyed the Blackwell series, then you probably know what to expect in terms of gameplay from The Shivah. A point-and-click game with occasional bouts of frustrating stretches where you wonder back and forth between locations, trying to figure out what detail you are missing. Your choices in dialogue do cause some small deviations in conversations, and there are several different endings that depend on the choices you make in the last scene (I would save before entering the final location so you can try again if you don't like the ending you get).Despite its flaws, I would recommend picking this game up on a sale, as the story is engaging for its short length (think around two hours to beat).

But ... it's about that.The game Rushes to it's conclusion so fast, that you can finish it in half an hour when you know the puzzle's solutions, only 3 (!) NPCs are important to the murder mystery, the mystery itself is found out through a quite clever puzzle idea, but that idea is overused and about the only thing you can do to advance the Plot. A certain way of talking is used as a joke, but while funny initially (and again at the end) it soon loses it's comedic value.The end fight itself is done in a unique and clever way, and fun once you figured out what to do, but the leadup to that fight is a series of more or less random dialoge choices that will lead to game overs over and over again unless you find the right path via trial and error. A puzzle shouldn't be done like this. This wasn't a puzzle. It was a chore.So what could have easily been a 9/10, ends up a short 6/10, or perhaps a 7/10 if you like the music and the setting.I can recommend the game wholehardetly if you can get the Key cheaply in a bundle or on Ebay, but don't expect too much from it.

From the start, the game works hard to build up a noir atmosphere, complete with the heavy voiceover. The jewish bits work fine with it as well, as a lot of the fun in the story comes from protagonist Russel Stone, wrestling with heavy moral issues. This he does, while balancing his role as a rabbi with his new role as a brooding noir detective, and i have to admit that i enjoyed that mix quite a lot. The semitic bits never gets in the way of the game though, and i appreciate that a little part of the game consists of learning some jiddisch for example. Also, it takes a lot of place in the dialog, and there is fun to be had seeing things from, and acting from the perspective of a rabbi, and the dilemmas they face.This does a lot for pushing the story along, and i enjoyed interacting with the character, and slowly unravelling the thread of the investigation. The problem is that the game is over when you are just getting started.It’s not that you don’t see the end coming, though. The game is paced very nicely. When mucking about with the investigation, you always feel like you are making progress, and you get that little AHA-feeling of discovering something new, and when you finally reach the end, there are no loose ends. But it also feels like you just got the hang of things, and now, you're all done. And that's a bit of a bummer.The game is also pretty good looking. The visuals might get a little bit flat sometimes, but everything looks and feels nice and atmospheric, with it's glorified sierra look. It also made me miss a point system, for added replayability.The voice acting and writing can get a bit hammy, but all that stuff is forgivable considering this is a game from a studio of just a few people. Considering that, i don’t expect Hollywood performances, but instead enjoy it for what it is.The shivah is not an epic, but that's kind of sad, for it has potential for a far bigger and more involved story in it."

Just use a walkthrough to get through the hard part.- Nobody calls the police even when they should really, really call the policeThe Shivah is a short experience. It took me two hours, including the time it took to exhaust all dialogue options and click on every object to read their (often witty) descriptions. Rabbi Stone is a fine protagonist, who manages to be bitter without becoming entirely unlikeable.  Dialogue branches will generally take you to the same conclusion, but the option to respond in different ways personalizes the experience enough that I didn't miss having more meaningful choices most of the time.That said, therearea few choices to be had, which will affect what ending you get. Refreshingly, the changes are all logical consequences of your actions, rather than the game simply giving you better endings as a reward for good behaviour. (Although needless to say, being the best person you can be never hurts.) Unfortunately, very ending cuts off a bit too abruptly, but there's enough sense of satisfaction from the climax of the story that I didn't feel too cheated. Overall, the game makes for a good short story.One additional note: I didn't realize before picking up The Shivah that it was a crossover with the Blackwell series. Luckily I love those games, and the character cameos here were subtle enough not to detract from the plot. I recommend fans of The Shivah try the Blackwell games if they haven't already; Blackwell fans might also enjoy this game, with the caveat that it's an earlier and therefore less polished work."

On the one hand, it's a point-and-click adventure with reasonable, enjoyable puzzles, a really solidly written story, and a (thankfully sensitively handled) Jewish twist on a classic film noir recipe. You play as Russell Stone, a down-on-his-luck rabbi running the saddest little synagogue in Manhattan. Faced with imminent bankruptcy, you suddenly find yourself inheriting a tiny fortune from a dead former member of your congregation who, by all rights, has every reason to despise you. With the police eyeballing you as their most likely suspect and your faith teetering on the edge of total collapse, you set out to discover exactly what's going on, armed with nothing more than a mean left hook and a knack for answering questions really obnoxiously. I quickly found myself liking the cast and appreciating the effort that went into the voice acting, and you can tell the dev team put a lot of love into bringing the story to life.On the other hand, it's noticeably short (I finished the game, replayed it, got every ending, and snagged every Steam achievement in under three hours), and it introduces features that get used exactly once before being set aside for the rest of the game. While this is better than a game that runs too long and relies too heavily on adventure game non-logic, I did wind up feeling just a little bit cheated.

If there was something I was dissapointed about it was the voice acting, the accents don't much all the time with the characters, the pacing and acting in the voice wasn't always appropriate, and at some lines the volume was diffrent and made the voice feel off place from the game.The game has multiple endings and a couple of achivements, but i felt like the end part was a little rushed. the dailoge options and gameplay mechanics to get the ""good"" ending weren't merging with the story and characters fluently, and i felt odd ""winning"" the game. still the eventual conclusion was good and worthwhile, and i liked it didn't only invlove solving puzzles but also saying the right things.All in all, i recommend this game, it's a fun old school adventure games that can fill a couple of hours and also a piece of history since the company made award winning games after this one. But frankly, if you want to be blown away and get a game that is really a testament to why classic adventure games were so good, get one of wadjet eye's later games.7 out of 10"

Most of the areas that you can visit are confined to 1 or 2 screens, and most of the information is garnered through snooping around on computers. There is an Internet search function as well, which I found to be neat, but it's easy to get stuck if you can't think of the correct terms to search for.

As a game, it is horrible. As a story, it is barely okay.The bulk of the game is made up of reading e-mails after the ridiculous ""hacking"" of three e-mail addresses (one of which is your own, but it still requires password-guessing). According to the developer, ""finding out"" passwords after finding ridicolously obvious clues is a good puzzle -- not only it is not, it is tiringly repetitive here. After the e-mail reading, you have some really straightforward chitchatting and then you can come to the endgame.The endgame is one large puzzle which can end in disasters in so many way. So most of your time playing this game will spend on re-re-re-re-re-playing the endgame and try to solve it with try-and-error. Because there is very little you can learn to help you to find out in advance how to avoid the pitfalls.As to the story, it is schematic and largely incoherent. It is also very short. I would be willing to pay for a two-hour game if it comes up with a gripping story, but it is like the overly simplifed, bared-downed draft of a thirteenth-class film noir.If you like this childish amateurship or you are a devouted fan of Dave Gilbert, buy this game today.

If you love the genre, you may find it to be worth some nostalgia.+ Interesting and rarely seen cultural context in games (Jewish life)+ Thoughtful non-dialogue narration.- Average to below average voice acting and dialogue for the most part.- Bland, generic plot with little characterization.- Extremely simply gameplay, even for a point and click game.- Very short (1.5-2 hours).This was not an awful game but it is a game that I feel showed its age. When it was released, perhaps it felt a lot fresh but I have to judge it from a modern day context. I expect a higher level of dialogue, characterization, and voice acting nowadays, especially for this type of game. The main plot never at any point really invested me in caring about it and it was lacking in anything truly compelling -- it feels like an episode of some detective/police procedural.However, the use of Jewish culture was a definitely plus as that's something you rarely see in video games. When those parts shined the brightest the game was the strongest. Jewish culture has a rich existential tapestry to draw upon and I wish the game would have delved deeper into that (ala something like A Serious Man). It does some in Rabbi Stone's inner monologue but it gets pushed out by the seen-it-a-hundred-times-before plot and other characters. How can we feel at all invested in the fates of Lauder, Raj, or Zelig when we know so little about them? Due to the shortness of the game (1.5-2 hours to play through), it'd be very hard to have a lot of depth.Additionally, there is not much of what one would call gameplay. There's not really any puzzles or secrets to discover, just a few places where you have to mostly guess.I appreciate the Rabbinical response options and achievements, though.

So what is? in short, the fact that ""classic"" adventure gaming is no excuse in my mind for treating an adventure gamer to Sierra-like RANDOM, PRACTICALLY UNAVOIDABLE, REPEATED DEATHS. I had to play the ending scene more than 10 times, until I ultimately gave up and reosrted to a walkthru. It saddens me to write this, but I'm done taking this kind of abuse from Wadjeteye."

The protagonist is a rabbi who is doing his best to hold his synagogue together.  He tries very hard to stay true to his religious beliefs while his congregation is falling apart, but finds himself in a complicated moral dilemma when he is forced to accept a cashed in life insurance policy.  The police start investigating him, his fellow rabbis are shunning him, and shadows are creeping behind him.The story, plot, and script is well written with extra attention to making every decision a challenging moral dilemma.  Each moral decision affects the end of the story, similar to Telltale games like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us.  Outside of the story based decisions, the puzzles are very detail oriented, and I recommend keeping a notepad on the side to write down clues.  Not every clue is going to be obvious, but each scene is pretty limited as far as interaction goes.  I completed the entire game in about two hours without any outside help.  If there was more to explore in each environment, the overall experience might have been a little more compelling.  Some type of pillow shots would have been welcome to build up suspense and reflection.The graphics are a bit on the simple side, but are well visualized none the less.  The voice acting is decent, and the ambient music helps flesh out each situation without feeling too contrived.  You’re not going to play the game for the audio and visual effects, or be compelled to download the soundtrack, but the game does well with what is provided.  The main focus is on the story anyways.Overall, despite it being short and simple, the moral dilemmas really made the game well worth the price I paid for it.  I do have to give a warning to those devout of any religion.  The game touches on subjects that could be interpreted as being sacrilegious, and may be very upsetting to some.  The environment and circumstances do touch on real life situations that are not completely unheard of.  I hope that anyone who plays it realizes it is a story of fiction first and foremost.  I do recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good whodunnit mystery."

,Recommended,252370,8346574,"Posted: 27 December, 2013",all,InsomniaJacket,"I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Wadjet Eye Games.  On the one hand, I like how they're a game company that specializes in adventure games, a genre that I spent my childhood absorbed in.  On the other, their puzzles can leave a lot to be desired, what with goals and inventory items not being 100% clear.  But what I've always respected from them was their drive to always try something different from their last project.  And with The Shivah, I can see where that drive started.The Shivah is the adventure game equivalent of a novella (about an hour if you know what you're doing).  You play the role of a Rabbi who finds himself caught in a web of intrigue from one of his previous synagogue attendants.  The story plays out in typical noir fashion, not really striving to break the mold of the classic criminal tropes.  But it's the characters that really make this game stand out.  To see this from the perspective of a lowly Rabbi adds a new take to what can be a fairly predictable genre.  As a result, the game provides you with a keyhole glimpse of the Jewish faith; not a crash course, but a clear distinction of its unique heritage.Like the game suggests, it is an almost-standard adventure game, complete with point and click methods of continuing the story.  I say almost standard because of the sleuthing mechanic, a feature that would find its way into the future Blackwell series.  And also like I said before, it may not be clear what you need to do.  There can be times where you'll be clicking on every entry in your notebook to look for a new clue, when the next step is to retrace your steps to another location.  You know: standard adventure game tactics.  Thankfully, the logic behind most of these puzzles is grounded, so they can be naturally discovered through time and thinking.Sure, it doesn't reinvent the wheel.  But it doesn't have to.  This is a project that offers a unique experience to step into the shoes of a Rabbi and learn something about Jewish traditions that I didn't know before.  So in the end, I'd call that a worthwhile purchase.  Especially at 5 dollars."

An austere protagonist guides this bitter but throughout moral detective adventure. Great experience to play a jew, this game is a real privileged uncommon plot to partake in. The voicework seems crude and roarse but gives personality to the pixel characters, and sets the tone the rabbi is in. In a detective game thread in reddit, someone commented that here some actual detective work was supposed to be done, and it is true. The interface reminds you of the clues, but it won't guide you by the hand; also, not everything is apparent, as it wouldn't be in a investigation, especially shoveling about emails.

Out of nowhere Stone receives the news by the police that an ex-member of his community was found dead and that he left Stone a lot of money. But why? And how did he die?The story's not the most exciting one I've seen but it's okay. It made me curious that there's something like a Jewish crime plot created as an adventure game. But outside of that gimmick ""The Shivah"" is rather mediocre than good.The game is very short. And solving the puzzles involves a lots of email reading. Not really exciting even though the mails provide you with clues like possible login data which are a pain in the *ss to figure out without consulting any walthrough guides. The rest is talking to people and going through clues a few times.I've played a lot of adventures games and the best of them give you a variety of actions: dialogues, using and collecting objects, going to lots of places. So the gameplay in ""The Shivah"" feels a little dry.One of the biggest problems is certainly a bug problem. In my case mail texts and dialogue boxes would just appear for a part of a second and then go away (so important information might get missed). If you notice the same thing, press the ESC key. But beware, it happens throughout the game, especially after leaving the Steam screen inside the game.But what's good in the game? Well, if you love point & click adventure games, a Jewish crime plot is at least a change.I like the music, the graphics are nice and the voice acting is a nice touch (even though it could be better sometimes).Plus: You can consider learning a bit of Yiddish vocabulary and reading Jewish jokes as neat bonus features.So: I neither say ""Go play this game, god damnit!"" nor ""Avoid this!"".

But nor was I entertained for long. This game is short- short enough to finish in one sitting, if you're on the ball with the few puzzles there are. Unfortunately, the game is too short to make the most of the interesting puzzle mechanics it briefly dips its toes into, or to do more than scratch the surface of its philosophical concerns of faith, grief, and communal obligation. The immersion and the menace of the noir storyline is similarly compromised by not going far enough, not getting tangled enough.But the puzzle mechanics are at least engaging without being overly complex- there's no pixel-hunting nonsense to worry about. In featuring elderly and Jewish and middle-eastern people in prominent roles, the cast stands out for offering something your average adventure title otherwise lacks. I'm not Jewish myself, so I can't comment on how sensitively the religious subject matter is handled, but as a relatively clueless ""goy"" I felt neither excluded, nor condescended to by it.I enjoyed the game and would recommend it as such- as an adventure game it's a brief but satisfying exercise.

When a former congregant is murdered, the rabbi decides to throw a metaphorical deerstalker hat over his yarmulka and go sleuthing.The game is short, with only handful of sparsely decorated locations.  There are no inventory-use puzzles.  Items can be picked up and examined for clues, but they can't be combined or applied to the environment.  As there's so little in each location, pixel hunting isn't much of an issue.  Gameplay is typical of the genre, with a couple of potentially frustrating puzzles that become quite easy once you realize that you solve them by acting like a rabbi.  How does one do that?  Don't worry, the game will tell you.  Repeatedly.The two things that make this game recommendable are: 1) The humour is excellent throughout, from jokes on the rabbi's computer, to his reactions to certain items and people in the environment, and voice-acting bloopers accessible once you've finished the game.  2) The heavy Jewish ambiance and symbolism.  I don't think there's another game like this, at least none that I've seen this side of the Israeli border.  The cursor is a chai (Jewish symbol of life), and the music always feels like it's three notes from shifting into Sunrise, Sunset.My only complaint about the game is length.  I would have liked it to have been about three times longer, and three times bigger, so the mystery could take it's time unfolding.If you've been looking to scratch that broken-hearted-rabbi-hunts-for-a-killer itch, this is the game for you.If you actually have that itch?

I'd never seen a Jewish point-and-click before this one, so I was curious to see what this was about. Not surprisingly, it's about Jewish people-- but that's about the only prediction I got right, this game is genuinely surprising. The creators did really well with their choice of music, settings, names, in-game computers (the jokes made me laugh a lot) and even the inclusion of Yiddish words, so you're bound to pick up at least a few Jew-isms, which is great to say walking away from a point-and-click.The game-play itself is fairly straightforward, and the story progresses quite nicely if you're smart about it. The clues are honestly not that hard to find, it just takes a bit of thinking to figure things out. The atmosphere and the story itself inspire a sense of dread and desperation, though I can't help but love the main character. There's a lot of zionist themes (surprise, surprise) in this game, and while I'm not a fan of zionism itself, I appreciated the dialogue, discussions, and explanations. I was terribly uncomfortable listening to Rabbi Stone's introspection and existential crisis, but it was something worth listening to, and I enjoyed it for that reason. I also enjoyed how the game touched on issues within the Jewish community, it's a pretty brave thing to discuss those things in a video game.Definitely pick this up during a sale, it's only major flaw is that it's too short, but otherwise it's a gem.

Its biggest shortcomings come in its lackluster length and reliance on a select few puzzle mechanics.Nevertheless, Its strong atmosphere, unique themes and the way it makes players think and use all the resources at their disposal make it a worthwhile experience."

The Shivah is very short, but that isn't necessarily a terrible thing.  It's as long as it needs to be.  The puzzle design is simple and logical and the penalty for failure is light.  The player can beat it without getting all the achievements, which suggests multiple paths (or at least approaches).A good game.  Probably worth a buck or two more than its current price, but then it has been around the block a few times."

Puzzles should be more than ""I have ten actions available to me, and have to do them in exactly the right order or I lose"", and especially not two of those directly in a row."

It is very short though as other commenters stated. It could have been a much larger, the story has potential, but I liked it."
