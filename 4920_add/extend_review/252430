I'll just list the points I like and dont:+Combo System+Story is good+Support system is good and helpful+requires Skill and not spamming the attack button-Bugs, still a lot of them-No damage recovery (As in knockback recovery and whatnot)-slight input lag-Crashes occassionallyAs for the Bugs of Day one:=combo Page is faulty=Crashes for no reason=Load times' still a ♥♥♥♥♥Overall Good game"

I am yet to play this game for more than 15 mins without it crashing or glitching. Every now and then the enemies will just turn into white pixels, which can be a completely jarring experience. The combo system is intriguing as it allows you to air juggle, along with incorporate a number of different weapons in combat. However using the assist character isn't a fine tuned enough feature to use outside of the brief puzzle/platforming parts. The levels, background illustrations and character design are gorgeous and the steam punk feel is fresh and consistent, however sometimes hard to appreciate the manic action on screen. Speaking again on the combat, while it has its flashy moments, its not the most rewarding system. True it packs in a bunch of abilities such as dashing, side rolls, and dives, but battle range from simply pressing one button to beat the crap out of all on screen enemies, to furiously trying to dodge bullets and fight at the same time. I think this game has tons of potential, but it needs some serious updating to be worth it."

It's crashing, lagging sometimes and the animation is not always as fluent as I'd have expected it to be. But even if there's those bugs (which are able to fixed in the future anyway), this game share a similar gameplay to Dust, just less fluent. But it is still very interesting and worths a shot. Co-op not yet tried, but It's probably pretty nice!I recommend it, but keep in mind it's not perfect, and if you're searching for a solo adventure with a flawless gameplay of the same style, look after Dust : An Elysian Tail."

This is my first review.Cons.This game has alot of problems from the Shaky cam; to the framerate dorp when your playing with another person, and finally the voice acting.Last but not least the fact that you need to download openAL just to get the sound working.But strangely i have to recommend this game if you can get passed that like i did.ProsThe Combat is really good but not too easy where it's just buttion mashing.The cutscenes and art in the levels look really well done.There's about 20 combos you get by leveling up.Some good quick thinking plaforming.Suport characters that are really useful.Boss rush. Which i record myself doinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzDnxra2vAs&list=UU3X76JzyV18SBqGsVBIz5Mw&index=6collectactables to unlock art and costumes.And a pretty good story that starts off small.Let's not forget this game was 10$ before they made it co-op which was a bad move imo. You don't bring your firends to your house to play on you gaming pc...that what consoles are for. Unless you have poor firends like me who are amazed by and want a gaming PC."
,Not Recommended,252430,11567158,"Posted: 5 August, 2014",all,Tetsuo9999,"The great art style of this game is not a good contrast to the stiff combat and unresponsive controls. It is very difficult to get certain combos out without mashing (which is something a polished character action game doesn't have), and the launchers tend to only work sometimes. I could see this being fun with two players, but the combat needs a serious rework before I could recommend it. It is fun when it cooperates, but after a few hours of play, it feels like you're fighting the controls and input lag more than the enemies themselves. I got about halfway through before stopping, but this would be a decent buy during a Steam sale, not at full price unless the control/input issues are improved upon."

I WOULD recommend it granted if the develepors or someone comes up with a solution as it is very addictive in all."

The story is.......not what you would call ""original"" but entertaining all the while. My main problem with the game is that sometimes some levels drag on for a bit longer than they should, but there are alot of fun combos you can do, the art style is incredible and the support characters are highly entertaining and are oriented into puzzles too. (I have not yet played ""co-op"" so i cant give any insight pertaining, but based on how smooth the game is i can only guess the multiplayer is too)"

The music is uninteresting and the game offers to incentive to use most of the combos. Bosses are uninteresting and the game tries to be hilariously edgy while simultaneously allowing the player to glide about using Dusty's ears as a parachute. Overall a weak title. Avoid."

I've tried many variations of fixes in order to hopefully get this game working, but alas....there was no success at the end. Constant game freezing, enemy sprites are just showing the hitboxes, and of course, Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime errors.The game devs seriously need to get to work on fixing this game before it can be verified as actually being 100% playable on any and all types of PCs, because as of right now, this build is a travesty of wasted gaming potential that barely anyone can actually sit down and play.Until said issues have been resolved, this game gets the thumbs down."

Other similar games have no trouble running on my computer, but this is a pretty big issue in my opinion. Doesn't help that there's input lag with the fps drops. It's a game with good potential if the technical difficulties didn't hold it back so much."

,Recommended,252430,25976301,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,IUserious,"I put off getting this game for a year because of some bad reviews saying it had input lag and crashed a lot. It was on sale for 60% off today and decided to see if any of this was true. Well I was glad to find out that it wasn't true. Maybe the developers have updated it since the last few discussion board threads and negative reviews because this game plays smoothly for me. No audio problems, no crashes, and definitely no input lag. Unless people are talking about the ""lag"" between heavy attacks, in which case, that just means you can't buffer your attacks, rather you have to time your button presses.I absolutely love this game! The animation style is incredible, Dusty's voice is awesome, and being able to level up the combo system keeps the game fresh and interesting. I would have preferred the cutscenes to have real time dialogue and sound fx instead of just Dusty narrating everything, especially since the story is a decent revenge one.However, that doesn't hamper on my experience too much as I am in love with the game's fighting mechanics. It would have been nice if the pace was quicker, especially since you're controlling animal characters it would have made more sense--but the graduated combo system and the support allies make this a fun and fresh beat 'em up!"

Very buggy and unfinished feeling!! How do I get my money back?? Tried giving it a chance to maybe clear up the glitches but it kept doing it.
,Recommended,252430,31406972,Posted: 27 April,all,komobutt,"Revenge is a dish best served dusty.Seriously though, the game itself is on the better side of meh. Gameplay works well enough, and the different forms of combat do fine on their own, but it really isn't anything to write home about. Same goes for the art and music. they aren't awful, but there are games similar to this that look much better. story's simple enough, some guy has a bad thing happen to him, and he's out to get the guy that caused it in all his edgy glory. If you really want a beat-em-up where you play as a western gunslinging, scythe-wielding bunny/human(there's a free DLC that allows you to make that change), it does the job well enough. If you absolutely NEED to get this game, it's on sale for $4.99 at the time of my writing of this review and it's the best price i can think of for a game like this. Otherwise, it's best to wait for it to go on sale again if you really, really, really want this game."
