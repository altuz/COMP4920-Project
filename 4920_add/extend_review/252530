,Recommended,252530,8007954,"Posted: 11 December, 2013",all,Yo-Landi Visser,"Where do I start... Oh well, what I like about Germany? Beer, maybe sausages? No. It's MAN bus manufacturer, and OMSI. It's been almost 3 years since OMSI 1 came out, and a long journey from 2012 announcement has ended. It's finally here, but does it stand up to the name of great simulation like the last one? Is it worth the asking price? Let's find out.After starting the game, pretty simple menu greets you. It has everything including tutorial, options, starting new game. Everything is self explanatory. Options may be confusing for people who aren't really into computers and configurations, but I'd say, set overall settings to PC 2006 or 2011 (options names) and you're good to go. Controls could be confusing too, but driving on keyboard (even is game is designed STRICTLY for steering wheels) is pretty well done, and is fun. I've had no problems setting up two steering wheels in it. After short configuration, I've finally started the game up. After pretty long loading, game had no bus whatsoever. So I've pressed ALT, and then a simple menu came out of nowhere. That little thing is handyas from here you can get new bus from there, fix it, choose timetable or change the Bus display. There is a lot to have fun with. So I've choosen Advertised MAN NG272 and then the fun began. First of all, this game is not for casuals. You need to know what exatly you need to do in order to start the electricity, engine, and then finnaly move your bus. You need a basic knowledge of how buses work in order to find OMSI 2 fun. So after some clicking with mouse on virtual cockpit of my NG272, I've finally heard this bearutifull beast. WOW the sound design is AMAZING. Everything is in place, even creeking of the joint of the Bus. Sound quality is TOP NOTCH. It's better than most games out there.Graphics however aren't that great. 2D trees crossed to make a 3D like impression, 2D bushes, and blocky buildings with pretty low-res textures and berlinians who walk pretty badly... but who the hell looks at graphics in simulation? Bus Models are top notch. Well detailed, well textured. However the deal breaker could be optimisation. It lacks a bit, but it's certainly better than the first one. After configurations you can get most out of it, that's why everything is so complicated in options menu. I'd recommend setting Texture Max Memory to max of your graphic card. Lags in game could be a little annoying while loading next map tiles, but you'll get used to it. Ai can also be pretty jerky, and pretty tough to cooperate with, but hey, when you get used to it, it doesn't really matter. We all need to give credit to Marcel Kuhnt and Rudeger Hulsmann (yes, those two guys created this game) for even doing such a great job on other aspects of the game.Physics are top notch. Every bump has it's feeling. You feel the mass of the bus, and also how well in handles (when of course you know HOW to drive a bus). You will feel significant difference driving on snow, and or dry asphalt. It's incredibly well made. What shines in this game is it's flexibility. You can do everything you want in bus. Open windows, manually open doors, press all buttons on cockpit and see what they do. It's like, literally, you can do EVERYTHING you always dreamed of with a bus, including even manipulating Roll-Band displays.Another great thing is it's modability. You can install user created buses, maps, scenery objects, sounds, Ai etc into this game. What's even more awesome, is that OMSI 2 is backwards compatible with all user created content for OMSI 1. Yay!For what it is, and for what it provides, yes, OMSI 2 is worth the money. Your childhood dreams of being bus driver finnaly came true, and what's more important, they are on steam, available to everyone. Aswell as Euro Truck Simulator 2, HEED THE MOCKERS. Don't listen to anybody who say that simulation games suck, because you will miss the pinnacle of simulation games on PC. However you look at this game, it's maybe not perfect, but it's excusable, due to low human resources of MR Software. I mean, come on. I've never saw two people creating such good game with such attention to detail. After starting up OMSI 1 and OMSI 2, I felt like they were both passionate about busses. Bus driving seems boring to some people, but believe me - it's a hard job. Those two guys captured the true feeling of that job. Game itself shows how much they loved what they did in this game. It shows how dedicated both Marcel and Rudiger are to simulation and re-creation of real-life feeling of such universal job. Yes, animations are lacking,  graphics too, and optimisation a bit aswell, but we cannot deny the fact, that nothing beats the OMSI 2 in terms of physics, sound and design. Other companies (Including TML Studios) cannot even think of being close to what OMSI 2 did. I won't spoil how many new things are in game. Certainly MAN NG272, thus argiculated bus support is there, which is a very nice touch. There have been improvements, and they certainly add even more depth to already impressive and deep simulation.It's a good game, for a good price. Pick it up if you're not affraid of it's downs.8.5/10(Original review restored)"

It is a game crafted with love and attention to detail, unlike certain other simulators.. *cough* Train Simulator.So what's so good about OMSI?+ The buses are very high quality, and almost every button in the cab works. Every little function in the bus actually works. Even the driver window slides! The bus sounds are top notch, and this game has one of the best sound engines I've ever heard.+ The game simulates passengers, and it does it very well. The passengers evaluate your bus driving, and will moan at you if the bus is too cold or too warm or you attempt to short change them. They will want to get off your bus if your driving is not up to scratch!+ The game fully simulates a 24 hour clock, and various types of weathers such as rain, snow, fog, etc. You will notice less cars and passengers at night, and lots more at rush hours.+ OMSI has a huge modding scene, which means you can download tons of new maps and buses for free. There's always more to do, and you don't have to fork out £24.99 cause you want some different scenery.+ Timetables are fully simulated, and AI buses follow them just like you. You can even take over an AI bus if you wish.+ The included Berlin map clearly had a lot of detail put into it. Compare it on Street view or compare images and the similarities become obvious right away.+ The game is supported with Official DLC's which are of great quality.+ The game has full steering wheel support which is really great if you have one.Okay, so what about the negatives?- The game WILL micro-freeze and suffer from framerate issues. If you are really really sensitive to issues like this, I would not recommend it. If like me you are willing to look past these issues, you will be fine. It doesn't prevent me from enjoying the game.- There are various bugs here and there such as the AI hitting you sometimes, passengers noclipping through bus stop shelters, etc.- The graphics are by no means amazing and they could be better, but I do think they do the job.- The game can be intimidating at first and the tutorials really are quite useless, don't bother with them.- The settings can be hard to configure, and aren't as simple Low, Medium and High. This can also be seen as a good thing as you can customise them best to your system."

Yes, they are a bit irritating but the gameplay is so good that I don't care about it. The game has an huge community (mostly german but there are also enough english speakers) with an large database of FREE mods like: new busses, new maps/routes, bus modifications, reskins etc.It's also very easy to mod it by yourself.DRIVING:(Please note: I'm using a steering wheel with force feedback as controller, this adds more driving pleasure to the game. It might be different when using a mouse or keyboard as controller)I start off with the most important thing of the game, driving!When you get in your bus for the first time, it could be a bit overwelding. The amount of buttons and switches are enormous. It isn't an easy to pick up game. If you want the full experience out of the game, you need to invest some time in it to learn how it works (the errors and the AI behaviour is a bit odd so in the beginning this can be quite frustrating but after some time you know how they respond so you can change your way of driving on it), and of course how to drive the damn thing ;-).If you get the hang of it you will see that it's quite fun and challenging to drive a bus. You have 12 meters behind you to keep an eye on and a schedule. You also need to take care of your passengers that want to be comfortable and on time at their destination.PERFORMANCEOmsi doesn't run on a fancy big graphic engine. Even the fastest PC can have some lag in this game. Omsi hasn't got a stable frame rate because the scenery is on any place different. But I can give you some predictions of what frame rate you will get:Low-end PC: 10-18 FPSMid-end PC: 20-40 PFSHigh-end PC: 30-60 PFSI know 18 FPS doesn't sounds much but there isn't really much fast action so it's acceptable and playable.MODDINGOmsi is a great game to mod! It has an open folder structure so you basically don't need to install any tools to get going. It takes time to know how to mod but an experienced modder shouldn't have any problems with it.Installing mods is as easy as extracting an archive file. And the good news is, they are all free!But when you want to instal a new map for the first time, you will find yourself getting loads of errors due to missing files. For many maps you need to download a whole list of other objects or maps to get going. But once you've installed a couple maps, you don't get many errors any more because most maps use the same objects.CONCLUSION+ Realistic driving physics and controls+ Huge amount of detail+ Fun to drive+ Large amount of free available mods+ Easy to mod+ Best (bus) driving simulator- Crashes sometimes- Some bugs- not easy to pick up (you need to invest some time to learn how the game works)- Not suited for everyoneI would definitely recommend this game if you like simulators. It's one of the best driving sims out there (yes, it beats Euro Truck Simulator 2 on the driving experience). If you can ignore the bugs and you are open to spend some time on learning the game and read some tutorials that you would have hours of fun with this game!Greetings from the Netherlands =D"

This game also comes with 2 maps (Grundorf and Spandau, Berlin) and are pretty well detailed. This OMSI is cirtainly one of THE BEST bus simulators out there, even though it is very buggy. The DLCs are also highly detailed, and are at very competative prices when compared with DLC for Dovetail Games' RailWorks.You may notice that (when you boot the game for the first time) no passengers will buy any tickets, this is not a glitch/bug, you need to change your settings by:1.

It cannot compare with Bus Simulator 2016 as it is honestly the most realistic and authentic bus sims can get. That being said, many people who have played this game, no matter how well their computer is, this game will deffinetly lag. There is just that bad of a platform for this game to run on. If this one thing could be improved, it would be for this game to run on a proper 64 bit system.However, this game, even though the prices seem high, is quite reasonable. Although I bought it when the price was $38.69 CAD, I feel that it is worth it. There are a hundred different map downloads online with an active community that makes maps for free. There are also DLC downloads. Some are great, such as the x10 Berlin and Chicago payware. There is also the upcoming South London which will show everyone that this game has potential to be made very well, in left hand drive as well as right hand drive.All in all, I love this game so much and the occasional stutters can not outweigh the awesomeness of this game! Played it for 6 months with 200 hours. You should consider buying this game if you are a self-aclaimed bus lover. So much so that you dream about it in your sleep...wat."

Personally, I would recommend this because of how authentic it is bus-wise, and how everything in the bus is clickable. But caution, you will need a powerful PC and lowered settings to run this game stable. If you get bored of the same old busses, lines/routes, there are various add-ons you can buy to expand the OMSI universe (Maps & Busses)."
76561198106942124,Recommended,252530,22523654,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,topline730v8,"I’ve had OMSI 2 for quite a while now and I’ve done many hours (My hours shown above doesn’t Include the tons of hours I’ve logged while on offline mode). So I think it’s about time I done a review.There are many games out there that wrongly claim to be a simulator, not this one. Without a doubt this is the most realistic bus simulator available. It’s definitely not game that you just can pick up and play and you won’t get very far without at least taking a look at the manual.The standard game comes with two maps, a small fictional map and Spandau in Berlin set in the years 1986 to 1994 with a selection of MAN buses from that era. As well as the official payware content there is tons of map and bus mods available adding greatly to the experience. My personal favorite mods are the Bowdenham and Szczecin MapsFirst off the good points. The game is extremely realistic the buses handle accurately and every switch and lever is clickable. You can control almost every aspect in operating the bus including ticket sales, destination displays, doors, lights, heating and so on. In the Berlin map, there is a chrono feature where the route and varies and ticket prices change depending on the time period selected. There is selectable weather conditions that can affect how the bus handles.Too often, games are often let down by poor sounds but not in OMSI 2 where they are truly excellent, the buses sound just like the real thing. Almost every sound is recreated such as the suspension rattling on bumpy roads, the whine of the transmission and even dashboard button sounds.Now to the bad points. The graphics aren’t particularly great by modern standards and the game is poorly optimized. It will take quite a bit of time tinkering around with the settings to get respectable framerates. The AI traffic is dreadful often crashing into you but thankfully AI collisions can be turned off. More casual players may find themselves a little overwhelmed by the lack of ingame help. Some may also find the price a bit steep and it’s never included in the Steam sales.Despite these issues, it’s definitely not a bad effort considering it was made by just two guys from Germany and not some big developer with a massive budget. In a way this game is kind of like an old Italian sports car in that much of the time it won’t run properly and will completely infuriate you but the times when it does work, it’s just brilliant and sounds epic.So to sum up, OMSI 2 may frustrate at first but give it a chance and it can become very enjoyable. You may even learn a little bit of German in the process. If you like very detailed simulators and have an interest in buses I would definitely recommend it."
,Recommended,252530,23434814,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,PinkGrind,"A die-hard simulator, that's for sure.Good things to note:Really amazing detail on the busses. Everything is clickable and the sounds are fantastic.Large maps which are open and unlimited to drive onFull control on what you want do. For example, if you just want to drive across the cities without a schedule, that's totally possible!Decent physics, and good thermal physics.Fully customizable weather and time. Play whenever you want on the calendar in whatever you want. The weather is simulated nicely.Gameplay takes place in real-time.Not so good things to note:There is quite a large learning curve for this game. Hopefully you can ask someone who's played the game for help in learning; not many good instructional videos/just instructions online. The in-game tutorial sucks, just don't do it. I got stuck so many times because things just weren't explained that well.There's not much in the way of goals in this game. Your only goal is to drive and follow your schedule very closely; when you get to the end, there's not much incentive for the driving you just did. I'd like a career aspect to this since being a bus driver is a job.AI can be dodgy - best to leave collisions between them off.Performance isn't all that great. The game is not optimized very well and loading in map chunks hangs the game from time to time. I have a really solid PC, recently built, and I get about 45 FPS average on what I presume to be lower settings. This is a good segway into:Options menu can be confusing. There's no 'normal' sense in the way of graphics settings; no resolution settings or other normal stuff. The controller setup is tricky too.While the detail on the busses is second to none, other details seem a bit lacking. By this I mean low-res people and scenery and both are very repetetive. Just to clarify, the map doesn't repeat, just scenery objects.Overall, it's a fun game. Definitely a bona-fide simulator. I can't imagine playing this game without a steering wheel so keep that in mind. Also keep in mind you'll need like an hour or so to learn some stuff and what to do in the game. After the learning curve, it's quite a relaxing game! Put on some of your favorite tunes and you got yourself an evening!"

I have a lot of patience for games that quite clearly try, but this game doesn't try, at all. It's very buggy, unstable, poorly made, and is yet another title that give simulators a bad reputation.The truth is that 30 € for this poorly executed and clearly unfinished title is bordering on criminal (esp 4 years after release where it's still riddled with gamebreaking bugs), and charging 370 € for the DLC, which is mostly nothing more than a a few more busses, is absolutely unacceptable. Sure, there is free modded content for the game, but the paid content simply isn't worth the price tag. The game is very unstable and unless you have enough RAM to load the entire map into memory when going into the game you'll be fighting with terrible stuttering and low framerate because the game for some reason refuses to use the GPU for the graphics. Without a proper settings menu there isn't much to do about the poor graphics or the performance, but you do need to move the FPS slider to 60 or higher where it belongs because for some obscure reason it's by default set to 30 fps. You also need to be aware that the default key assignments make no sense and don't correspond with any other game or simulator released in the past 30 years. You can redefine all the keys, thankfully, but you need to remember all 100+ key assignments because the prompts can't figure out to tell you the keys you've set and unless you're good at memorizing the layout of buttons in the busses, you need the shortcut keys to do anything.It's quite clear that this game was made by a few guys with a dream, no money, and not enough resources to make their dream into what they wanted. It attempts 100% realism, which is fine, but it means you practically need to be an experienced (German) bus driver to play the game because it doesn't explain anything properly. The UI design needs a LOT of work and some serious effort need to be made into teaching you how to play the damn game.The busses are very accurately modelled and every single button works and has a function, and with that comes the problem of actually playing the game: You need to know what every single button does and what every single warning light means, and what the correct procedure is for doing absolutely everything you need to do from getting the bus moving, to setting the route, to taking on passengers.That wouldn't be so bad if the game made a decent effort at telling you how to operate the busses, using the IBIS (which normally is a multi-day class by itself if  you want to be a bus driver), or what each button is, but that is not the case. There's not a single tooltip anywhere and the tutorials are absolutely hopeless. If you can get through the awful excuse for a translation you'll quickly discover that the tutorials will ask you to do things that they never explain how to do, or that they require you to remember long convoluted procedures. The game also doesn't tell you whether your bus is ready to go or not; it's up to you to remember (memorize) every single step you need to take every time you start on a new route. There's no checklist or anything to remind you if you've missed anything - and there's a lot you can miss."

Tell us the German name as well, or at least provide tool-tips!Controls:- Despite claiming full joypad support, the joypad controls are far too sensitive; the slightest movement results in screeching tyres and complaining passengers. A separate program like Xpadder is required to use the more linear steering setup of the keyboard version.- Some controls needlessly require separate on/off buttons to be mapped instead of a single toggle switchOverpriced. You only get one map and a tiny tutorial map. Including more maps would make it a fairer price.Good luck with getting through the poorly-translated, buggy tutorials and setting up the convoluted controls before your 2-hour refund window expires!On the positive side, once the initial period of frustration is out of the way, it does provide a fairly satisfying in-depth simulation of bus driving. If you can overlook the many issues you should get some enjoyment out of it (you only need to look at the thousands of hours some of these other reviewers have ploughed into it to confirm that!), however it is very expensive and therefore I can only recommend it if this sort of thing really floats your boat.

76561198065931408,Recommended,252530,29680454,Posted: 3 February,all,Madman,"OMSI 2 is like the Microsoft Flight Simulator of busses. Over 90% of the buttons, switches, are clickable and have different functions. OMSI 2 took me a few days to learn how to properly set up lines and routes in the game, so for those looking to jump right in and start driving and picking up passengers, OMSI 2 is not for you. This game requires a decent rig to play, especially if you want a decent frame count. It's upsetting that for a game that looks like this I get lag in certain areas and I have a good PC, but after you do some work on getting your video and graphic settings perfect you will get a fair FPS count. All in all, OMSI 2 is a fantastic sim that keeps me playing this at least once every couple of days for a few routes that normally last up to 40 minutes. The DLC is overpriced, but I've still bought a few of them and the DLC is high quality, but not for the same price of the game. This review is a little all over the place, so I'll end it by saying, forget Bus Simulator 16, that game plays like garbage and the passengers talk to you like you're an idiot. Definitely worth the money for the base game!"

That said, there is -NO- simulator as realistic and with the huge sortiment of maps and vehicles OMSI has. They have been quite slow in getting OMSI 2 stable and its engine is sort of outdated, but with a modern PC you can get a serious amount of fun even out of huge maps. Plus: the community has always been developing things for the community, that is: out of my 5-6 current standard maps only one is payware, and that one - Rheinhausen - is worth every bit. So don't mind the payware when testing, and if you like OMSI, it's a month's pocket money of a schoolboy compared to other DLC games like Train Simulator to get everything there is.If you like versatility in maps / bus repaints / buses, and if you like a real simulator, there's no way around OMSI 2. I wish Aerosoft were quicker in fixing bugs and they'd even develop OMSI 3 somewhere with a better vehicle AI and a better engine (you do smell the dust on it in the background).

WASD or whatever you prefer.Other than the confused start this game is a must-get if you are a bus fan or like to try out simulators.There are a few crashes and bugs that still need to be resolved but hopefully that will be resolved. Another thing, 3/4 tutorials are german but apparentlyh being translated to english soon so try and stick to the manual until the tutorials are english, that's if this is your language.So if you're looking for a bus simulator and willing to get the best experience out of it, I recommend OMSI 2!

Real time play ensures you try to meet your schedules. Fully controlable vehicles, everything from lowering the step to adjusting the sun blind.The AI vehicles act realistic, like indicating one direction and going the other. They try to cut you up & cross lanes just in front of you. Go through red lights. Try & beat you at getting somewhere first. This is a real challenge with collisions turned on. However, buggy AI vehicles 'ghost' through themselves & tend to collide with you. So its probably best to keep collisions off ATM.Theres no company bosses to answer to. You just get in a bus, select a timetable & away you go!!! Or, if your like me, play a freelance driver. Set a destination, head that way & pickup or drop off whoever you come across. Theres no company bosses to answer to. This is only to mention a few things. Its practically a 'digital job' !!Flip side of that is its very slow for updates & bug fixing. I understand theres been internal issues going on causing these long delays. Still buggy a bit as mentioned and theres been an ongoing problem for many with Multithreading.

If you can lower your settings enough or install a 4GB patch to your OS then you're normally fine. Mod support - yes, I said it was great that you can mod the game so heavily, is lacking - no central library of other available assets so you can spend a good hour or two trying to get each (unofficial) add-on to work.Lastly, the attitude towards English-speaking players from the official forum community is frequently offputting and doesn't help us to feel part of it.

Definitely it is a game for me too, but there seems to be some issues/bugs.After reducing threads (or what ever was that option called that the game itself proposed after the first crash) helped a lot to the crashing. It still has some random crashes but not too often. Sometimes you manage to lose open window somehow behind the game so that you cannot access it anymore and there seems to be no way to get the window on front again. Sometimes the game doesn't seem to recognize when you arrive to the last stop and then I have to drive a little loop to arrive the stop again. And the line destination setting doesn't work if you write the destination with all minor letters even it looks like that the destination is found from the drop down many correctly, cure for this is to open the line setting window again and press okay (since this time the game has set the minor/major cases correctly), if you fail to notice that you might lose passengers since they don't recognize the arriving bus to be their one.Still, after knowing these bugs you can get decent ""game"" play and at least I enjoyed it a lot.

I was curious about how things were in Europe and decided to try it out. After a lot of time and patience spent learning the ropes I decided it wasn't really worth the effort.The sim is somewhat unstable and needs a very powerful system to run it. My cheap 1 Gb AMD R7 360 graphics card gives borderline performance, but at least I can run most of the sim and DLC with it. For some reason Chicago Downtown is not playable on my system with frequent crashes after single figure framerates in the many traffic jams that are encountered.The bus models are excellent, as are the engine sounds, although the passengers are decidedly terrible. The AI traffic is passable, although perhaps a bit too predictable. Real life bus driving is not an exact science, as the sim seems to want to portray.What the sim does:- Tries hard to make the user believe he /she is driving a bus in service, dealing with customers and busy city traffic.What it doesn't do:- Any of the above.The sim is a very optimistic attempt to simulate bus driving, and the developers have to be commended for their efforts. The buses look and sound real, it's just that everything else does not.The door controls in particular are a chore to operate, and negotiating give way junctions into moving traffic is not for the fainthearted.I enjoy playing car racing games, but perhaps if I was a professional racing driver I would not enjoy them at all.If you like buses and fancy something different then give this one a go. You don't need a steering wheel to manage the buses. With a little practice you can even use your built in laptop mouse to steer.The big downer in this sim is that a bus driver needs to be able to see both rear view mirrors and the full width of the bus without having to press a button or a control device to achieve that. Sharp right turns mean that you need to change view to watch your nearside mirror as you turn so you don't mount the kerb or collide wth any street furniture at the location. Then having made the turn, you need to change back to the default forward view to proceed safely. I know this can be achieved with a POV ""hat"" type of controller, but it still means trying to do two things at once to achieve a safe turn.I cannot really recommend the sim, largely due to the instability issues and the need for a high spec system to run it. There is also a fairly steep learning curve before you can get up to anywhere near service speed."

Many of them claim to have decent machines to play OMSI on, well they don't because buses that jump and down only happen on low-spec PCs.This is a simulator and not some kind of dirt rally driving game. This is as realistic as it gets as far as bus simulators go and to be honest, this really is the only one of its kind out there at the moment.You have to learn how to select your route and line (Bus) number. You have to learn how to operate the buses because nearly every switch and button is modelled to work like the real buses. You have to learn how to use the ticket machine e.t.c. In other words, you have to read the PDF manuals and watch YouTube videos to help you familiarise yourself with the game.The physics and sounds of the bus models are pretty darned good with suspension and the buses rattle and shake when driving over rougher roads with broken tarmac and pot-holes just like in real life. There are automatic announcements on some routes and you can even download the current real-world weather to drive in.There is quite a lot of paid DLC to expand with more routes and more buses including lots of freeware maps too.The game is of course pretty old now and is not really optimised for todays PCs as it's only 32Bit and limited to 2Gb of RAM which is why you need to download the seperate 4Gb patch but its still a perfectly good working game and lot's of fun."

AI buses take passengers, just like player's bus. Whenever he likes, player can jump to bus controlled by AI, and take control, leaving his own bus to AI.Routes are long, some of them demanding, tight schedeules etc. Lots of fun.Day-night/weather effects also are implemented. Want to drive night bus, rainy/snowy day ? Did you know that wet / snowy streets change how ie. braking system works ? On a frosty day not setting properly air conditionig will cause passengers start to complain thet its to cold in the bus.Graphics may not look so awesome like in newest FPS games, but this one has unique setting and feel, and is highly detailed.Game has lots of player created maps and buses (search for them on omnibussimulator.de)  available for free, but also great paid addons, which add buses to whole game, and maps with loads of schedeules to follow.So, if You're bus sim fan - its recommnended, lots of fun awaits You,otherwise consider this as good but somehow specific game."

From th e first purchase, there's not much content unless you buy quite a bit of DLC. The vanilla flavor of the game has only a whopping two maps to drive your Bus in, and only a handful of different buses to drive, many of them seem to be repeats. How ever, despite the two maps, one of them does have many different routes for you to take, so that's nice. From my experience, the other just has one.This game does have a bit of a steep learning curve, and it did take me several attempts of picking it up and trying to go through the tutorials to figure out what was what, and then once I got that down, I had to try and set keys for my Logitech G27, which only added to the complexity, as you have more controls you need to be aware of for your bus then allowed on the Racing wheel's extra buttons. I'm not kidding, you literally control everything on the Bus. From doors to heating system, to interior lights to opening and closing your driver side window!Beyond that, driving a bus, picking up and unloading passengers is actually kind of fun. If you find a route that you like, you can find yourself sinking some time into this game, if you like running around in circles, that is. Of course you have to make sure you are not late, punch tickets, print tickets, give change to passengers, etc etc.The biggest thing that stops me from enjoying this game is that it crashes for no apparent reason with almost no indication of an update from the developers in the near future. The last update, according to steam, was in May. This really makes you wonder if the developers are doing something for this game or not, or if I've missed something.. Granted they are adding DLC but there has been reports of crashes happening still.There are mods you can download and add into this game, but I haven't dabbled to much. It might help you out, maybe fix the game crashes, but you should proceed with caution.Despite the game crashing bugs and the hard-to-learn controls, this game is .. Tolerable. Adequate. I would love to see where the developers take this game, but as far as I know, it's a hit-or-miss situation. Should you get it? Honestly, I wouldn't, at least not right now. The bugs in this game are to much to bare to really enjoy it. Believe me, I wanted to enjoy this game, but when it crashes in the middle of a route, I find that to be a little disappointing. You might have better luck then I do, and if you want to try your luck, go for it. Otherwise, I would stay away."

Right from the very get go you are left completely wanton, now i realise that this is a german sim but come now guys not everyone speaks german, what use is it of me downloading an english install only to have everything in german (one demerit). Okay so moving on seeing as there is apparently no way around this, next we have the interface, while it could be a little bit more userfriendly and perhaps presented in a more visually appealing way after playing around with it you should be able to navigate it with relatively minimal stress, which brings us to the tutorials, while relatively straight forward actual translation of that information becomes somewhat cumbersome because the keys are not quite mapped as described in the tutorial (Shift Z for example is actually Shift Y). So alas feeling rather chipper with myself having ever so painfully navigated the first few steps i find myself confronted with a situation which requires me to pan the camera in order to view a certain piece of equipment, now take into consideration i am using a laptop which has no center mouse button an up to which time i was dreading not to have to come across such a situation so needless to say dead in the water. Now the point been here that that while there is some kind of game controller customization (ie, key mapping etc albeit very limited) there appears to be no hat switch functionality, further more precise tuning for racing wheels such as the driving force gt and so on which have 900 degrees of turning radius more or less is extremely lacking and to be quite honest borders on non exsistance. Okay so resigning myself to the fact that it'll take me forever and a day to actually do a successful trip (passngers the works) i decide to just jump into the game based on what little info i've manged to muster up and here goes im in the bus its actually running and in gear everything seems like we good to go so give her the gas and bam im bouncing, crashing scrapping the whole works, more like a rodeo than a bus ride okay so i let things settle down a bit (apparently if you crank the graphics settings too high the game goes beserk all this despite having a more than capable machine so lower the settings and things seem to be a bit better, now just to perhaps say something obvious, im paying for an experince in its full glory and not some half blur world and footlong draw distances but anyway moving on...) so driving along now everything is just dandy trying to get a feel for things go and step on the brakes and half near fly out the windshield (theres that pesky precise game controller tuning thing again) so basically you want to use the brakes with without actually using them hmmmm go figure. So In a nutshell ive owned this game for two days and thats about the progress ive made, esentially as much progress as a moss growing up the side of an old english castle wall. Now before the naysayers get all excited i am yet to try it out on another machine which is more than a monster enough to push the graphics, did i mention that the laptop is no slouch either btw pretty sure i did but anyway thats that. For the record i am a hardcore die hard sim fanatic so pls reserve otherwise personal vendettas to your loo, i know the benchmarks of great sims and this one while it will have its second day of rekoning with me on a different machine at which time its final judgement will be passed as it stands i give it 1.5 out of 5.

Let me break it down for you, the gameplay is amazing, it is very realistic driving (even with the mouse and keyboard), but it had some issues too. The game is not really optimised, so you will not be having the highest frame rates, but since not much is going on, it is not much of a problem. Additionaly, alot of things (errors messages, some tutorials, and other things as of this time) are in German, so you might have some issues there, though it is constantly getting better in English so I do not see this as a problem. My last complaint is that the menus are not very good, and it is confusing to learn how to get around them. Now on to the good stuff. The driving is excelent, and it is just a very good game if you are willing to put in the time to learn how to use it properly. I would definatly recommend this to anyone who likes simulators, and has the money (as it is $35). I would not recommend this game to anyone who already have OMSI 1 (as there are not many changes), or who is not that into this type of simulator, there are many others out there to make sure you like it first.

Yes, setting it in late eighties to early nineties Berlin doesn't increase its sex appeal any more than announcing that Anne Widdicombe finally got a Brazilian either.However, there's something special about OMSI2 - Der Omnibussimulator 2, or simply put: The Bus Simulator 2 in English. It's truly magnificent if you want Germans to swear at you or if you want to waste half an hour on figuring out what ""Ernerungsterif"" or""Betriebsfahrt"" means. It'll leave you frantically skimming though the manual as you try and figure out why the bus all of a sudden seized to move (curse you, auto kneeling mechanism), however all is forgotten the moment you roll out of the depot on a dark Sunday night as you make your way to your first stop though the calm Berlin streets. There's nothing quite like driving a night bus in BS2, your passengers, albeit few and far in between, really gives you a sense of satisfaction. Sure the passengers has about as much excitement and enthusiasm as the performers in a strip club has during their 9AM Monday morning performances but they still sit there in your bus, quietly waiting for their destination, they leave you thinking about who they really are. Is the younger chap five rows down making his way across town at his lovers behest.The technical aspect of BS2 is less so, it crashes as frequently as Lindsey Lohan runs out of cocaine. The graphics is about as exciting as a carton of milk is to look at, you're lucky to find a tree with at least one polygon and god forbid you leave the carefully designated routes as you will encounter the sky dome with no warning whatsoever if you do.BS2 shouldn't be good, it shouldn't make me want to play it for hours on end, but something about is just so appealing. Maybe it's because the two people (really, two people made this) made this game purely based on the fond memories they had when they rode on the buses operating on the Berlin Municipal bus lines 25 odd years ago.It's pure nostalgia and passion, the audio side of the game is nothing short of perfect and the game itself is nothing short of amazing. It doesn't take more than a minute or so behind the wheel of my bus of choice before I'm sitting feeling quite content with life.The review submission page asks whether or not I recommend this game. Yes, BS2 is as polished as Battlefield 4 is and still are. Yes, it really is about driving a bus.It's not for everyone, but I do recommend this in a heartbeat if you have even a vague desire to play this.I do, however, feel that I need to add more requirements to the list provided by the publisher:You need a gamepad, preferably a wheel in order to drive in a way that doesn't look like you've had 6 racks of beer and 7 bottles of vodka.It's also based in Germany so there's quite a bit of German language involved.

It's set in Germany in the late 80's and early 90's, and you can drive buses from that era. You drive on bus routes with a timetable, pick up passengers, sell them tickets, and drop them off at their destinations.Pros:Realistic controls. Each control on the dashboard does exactly what it would do on a real bus.Great sound effects. The buses sound just like they do in real life, with gear changes, shakes, bumps, etc. There are also some nice sound details like outside ambient sounds becoming louder when windows are open.Nice weather effects including rain and snow.Large variety of different buses to drive, including single deckers, double deckers, and bendy buses.Includes a map editor so you can edit existing maps or make your own.Various mods that add extra buses, maps, etc.Cons:No Steam Workshop support for mods.The English version of the game isn't fully translated, and some dialogue boxes are still in German.Performance isn't great. You might have to lower the settings on larger maps to get a decent frame rate. Even on a high end PC it struggles on max settings.The game can be unstable at times and randomly crash.Only 2 maps are included with the base game. There are some DLC maps but you have to buy them separately.Overall I would give OMSI 2 a 7/10. It's pretty realistic, but it can be unstable and does lack in content without buying DLC or installing mods. Though the game was only made by 2 people, so you have to give them credit for what they were able to make."

The game has aswome community. if you need help with something some one will usally have an answer. THIS IS THE BEST BUS SIMULATOR I HAVE EVER PLAYED."

It's the only thing putting me off from purchasing and playing it. Excellent realism for the buses but the outdated texturing for scenery and rubbish AI kinda makes me wish I was rich so I can buy the rights to the game and make it modern with Unreal Engine 4 or something. It needs love and attention; not recycled nappiesI played 2 hours of back and fourth to settings to make the game look and function properly. The menu system is tedious to navigate around and it looks awful too because it's Windows, it's 1 step away from looking like a fully fledged (Microsoft Access) database. I couldn't even find the instructions to work my bus and there was a lack of tutorial within the menu. So after 2 hours I was frustrated because I couldn't get the game how I wanted it. I had low fps, missing textures and a clunky UI to wrestle with; I was thinking whether this was meant to be a game or a chore?I'm not going to tell people not to buy this because there are advanced humanoids out there smarter than me who can get this game to work and there are genuine follower's who like the game for what it is. I like buses and I like realism but this game has spent far too long in Wonderland and has become outdated.HINT: Unreal Engine 4 is free to developer's in case your worried about cost, all they ask for in return is a small royalty cut when the game is released. You already have a huge fan base so that won't be an issue."

,Recommended,252530,20713843,"Posted: 23 January, 2016",all,Andysj2017 (CZGA),"Omsi 2 is a game that you cannot take seriously.You can try, you can set up your fancy steering wheel, clip on your TrackIR, have the IBIS app on your mobile phone of choice, even wear a floppy hat, but when you get started, you learn that the AI is just too dumb to play it seriously.Part of the fun is the mishaps that happen on the way, which there will be many. Under the hood the game is actually pretty darn great, good bus physics, and the sound design is just one of the best in gaming history (and that is no joke). Collision physics suck, mind. Well, they're great if you want to shoot your own bus, or another bus, into the stratosphere.For the most part the quality of the content is good, very good in fact. Originally a tiny dev team it is clear that this was a labour of love, and that effort shows in the stock content and some of the DLC. SOME, not all. Very much like Dovetail, Aerosoft are willing to put any old map/vehicles on the Steam store to earn them some cash. This makes purchases very hit and miss, and finding reviews in a place other than Steam could be difficult. In general though, pretty good, and Omsi 2 has a great modding scene, some of which equal or even better the quality of official DLCS.Omsi 2 is oddly engaging, and entertaining, and sort of falls into that realm of Farm Simulator or Eurotruck Simulator where really the game should be boring as hell, and maybe it is, but you still come back for more. There is a odd satisfaction of driving around a sleek, modern hybrid bus, or one of those real diesel smoke spewers of the 80s, you can practically smell the stubbed out cigarettes and that yellow liquid that could either be beer or urine or both.What this game begs for is optimisation. The game engine of Omsi 2 is pretty much as good as it can get, DLC creators try their best to improve matters, but the core game itself could do with a proper polish up (pokes Aerosoft in the ribs, you listening?). I would love to see this in something like the Unreal Engine or Unity, doubt that would happen though. Any half decent rig should be able to make very few concessions in game settings, but don't expect constant 60s.If you want to buy a few DLCs to expand on the stock content, the Berlin X10 is a great buy (huge map), as is Hamburg. The forthcoming Omsi 2 Add On London DLC (formerly the mod called The South London Project) is one I'm very much looking forward to, not only to drive some iconic buses, but also to terrorise the streets of my nations capital."

Both are great and work greatly. The Volvo even goes as far as using MOBITEC Destination Displays with the MobiICU400.A game truly for the bus fan, one which gives you the most control over your environment and vehicle. If you are here for a simple sim, you might want to try City Bus Simulator 2012 or City Bus SImulator Munichen by Astragon Software.

I was really dissapointed, so i was playing the smallest map and only 1 route and i was getting bored of it. So after about one month i stopped playing, i dont recommend this game to anybody exepct if you meet well above the standards. The buses are pretty realistic and nice, the driving feels nice. The time and how to turn on the bus at the start is quite long and hard. Its sort of annoying since people wont really being playing this game to learn how to drive a bus. The passengers mean while sit like they're holding an invisble balland just dont move and yell complaints at you not great and the passengers almost are the same only about 10 diffrent passenger clothing. This is also in German i know how to speak some German but it is hard to understand and hard to learn how to drive. Then coming back to not using this for learning you would have to know german to learn how to drive, so if you live in germany its a real boost.

How is the gameplay overall, it SUCKS!  OVERALL ANYWAYS... There are definitely well....just there are some good points of this game. It is very simulated as far as what a bus driver does before he or she even turns on the bus. Most of the buttons on the dash and around you are push activate buttons, HOWEVER they are in GERMAN. I guess that part makes sense considering the gamemakers theirselves.So when someone says they have it in English they aren't 100% correct. There is GERMAN dialect in almost every aspect of this game even if its as small as a button on your dashboard.As far as the steering is concerned, unless you have a wheel and you can control the sensitivity then its a challenge to steer  but not impossible. I tried EVERYTHING, my PS4 controller which took me only so far, then the keyboard which was horrible, and the mouse.  Using the mouse to steer and accelerate was not bad. You just select mouse to control drag the cursor up to ACCELERATE, and down to BRAKE. Left to steer, Right to steer pretty simple and halfway decent.Now this review is based on the fact that I haven't downloaded the DLC for Chicago Downtown which thats the main reason I bought the game, cause after all everything in route is in English. Also a few YOUTUBERS did a great job displaying gameplay for CHICAGO (shoutout to Squirrel).I am however afraid to download the DLC for Chicago because when I first started downloading and installing this game it right off the bat was giving me troubles. Crashed a few times and some of the tutorial shortcuts didn't work. Even crashed at tutorial 2. For a better tutorial go to YOUTUBE and look up OMSI for Squirrel or OMSI for StudiousGamer.SO MY FINAL VERDICT, based off of the 8 hours of gameplay would I recommend this game to anyone. NO. I paid $35 and unless I get the Chicago DLC and actually can play it I will feel that this is a complete waste. IF YOU ABSOLUTELY want this game, its $30 on Aerosoft website, $29 with tax on Amazon however with Amazon Digital Download you DO NOT GET A REFUND."

When you 1st get the game and start, things can be tricky, the game is set by default to lock keyboard steering wheel (make the wheels lock when turning) so if your using a keyboard to drive you SHOULD turn this off. The mouse steering mode is much better though, it provides a more smoother and enjoyable experience.The game is tricky at the start, and you I would reccomend changing the controls the way you like them so it makes things easier. The tutorials are great, they are very detailed in telling you what to do, however, you can't change the keys or options during them.The graphics are not amazing but are fine for me, I don't mind about them anyway. There are some notable bugs and glitches and also graphic issues which are only solved by restarting the game. Some bugs include: slow buses, black textures, passengers stopping and will not board the bus and a major one is that sometimes no passengers appear at stops. Other than this, the game is fine. The game is set in 80-90's Berlin and is a highly realistic to what Spandau area looked backed then, bus stops and lines are real and so are the veichle repaints. The game is highly moddable, and you can change about anything from passenger numbers to making your own lines on the default map or any others on the map editor. I would suggest getting freeware maps from the internet as you will get bored after a while with the normal game. I have also purchased payware DLC via steam which are mostly maps and are great.Overall,  a great game for anyone who has an interest in it, highly reccomended."

,Recommended,252530,16784276,"Posted: 29 June, 2015",all,cR11,"OMSI 2 is overall, a very good game.Basically if you want to know whether you should buy it or not - if you don't want to drive a bus don't get it, simple as, but that's the obvious. It comes with a few paid DLC packs, including Vienna, Hamburg and recently released Chicago which are all good, but some people don't realise you can download so many third party maps and buses.It's one of the best driving simulators there is, in my opinion. It's just very prone to errors and freezing, it's not fully developed and at least for now it's easy to work around once you know what goes wrong. However, it really does make up for it for the amount of third party maps and buses you can download. Downloading maps - things very easily go wrong and that's where OMSI can hopefully improve in the future, in making the game stable and simpler to use, possibly. Once you understand basics of downloading buses and maps then it is usually easy to work with.I wouldn't recommend buying the game if you aren't going to download any maps however. You'll only have Berlin-Spandau and Grundorf which get very boring after a while. There are so many maps you can find, small and big ones.I do enjoy the game very much though and I totally recommend it!"

If you don't mind some quirks there is a lot to like here. The detail on the bus models is amazing and the sheer complexity of all the things you can alter and change on the bus is quite overwhelming to begin with. Reading the manual and having a pen and paper handy to make some notes is a must. The attention to detail in the sound is something to behold. After a bit of digging on google I discovered that the destinctive transmission sound was so familiar because the busses that used to transport me to and from school in the UK used the same transmission as the double deckers on OMSI.Learning the routes takes some time and keeping to the schedule is very hard to do without upsetting the passengers. If you want a real driving challenge this will keep your mind active for a long time. There is just so much to consider all at once. It's very hard not to become flustered at first. Stay with it and you start to become pretty addicted to the challenge of getting that bus there in one piece on time with satisfied passengers. A lot of love has gone into this by the creators who have succeeded and then some IMO of encapsulating a period of history inside a game that brings a great deal of enjoyment to play.

They're fun to drive and smooth, with the exclusion of the NL202 (partially) the NG272.(see negatives below)The X10 Addon bus, the MAN Lion's City DD (AKA DL05, 07,08 & 09) are well made too.2. The WorldsThe base Spandau map, is distinct and well created, with rarely any glitches, but it does lead to an issue.Berlin in the X10 Addon takes place primarily in the south west of Berlin, with the famous Berlin Zoo and the town of Zehlendorf being immersive and well made.3. The CommunityEver since the original was released in 2011, many players of OMSI have made add on buses, maps, repaints and more for free, which really has increased the longevity of the game and has allowed OMSI players other the world to come together. Not to sound flowery, but its nice to see others adding content to the game based on their hometown, so there is a varying degree of maps and buses to utilise and explore. Again, there are negatives to this.4. The Game's ExisitenceThe game existing is a good thing, due to the lack of well made bus simulators, which this definitely is. Amongst older simulators like the Bus Simulator series and even the really old Bus Driver from SCS software, it stacks up pretty well.Whilst, yet again, this is a good thing, it leads to an negative.1. The BusesSMALLER ISSUESAs stated before with the NL202, there is a tiny nitpick and this can also be stated for the 'Three Generations' addon of the 2013 Citaro C2 bus.The braking is quite tight, even if you don't apply too much pressure, which can lead to passengers complaining. adn on the C2 bus, a jerky ride. The NG272 has a larger problem. I understand the point of the swaying connector of the bus, hence the 'articulated' name, but the squeaking noise it makes when turning corners can be quite annoying, especially on the more corner heavy route: the 5 (or 130).The Lion's City DD can also have texture errors, as the bus is quite demanding, meaning that sometmes textures don't load, leaving the windows opaque, preventing anything to be seen from the inside.BIGGER ISSUESThe more prevalent negative however, is the fact the range of buses is quite poor for both the base game and the X10 addon. Only 2 double deckers with slight variations and 1 single and articulated bus for the base game, as well as only 1 single decker for the X10 addon. Its pretty poor, which leads to many (me as an example) paying for addon buses to use in the maps.2. The WorldsBASE SPANDAU MAPI appreciate the effort placed into recreating many cities around the world for players to explore, but in the long run, these efforts will be forgotton and people will wonder why there isn't more.For example, the base Spandau map in all honesty has only 2 day routes: the 5 and 92.I don't count the 130 and 137, just because they take place in a different time period, its essentially the same as the original, except for the extension of the 137 form Freudstr. to Falkensee Bahnhof.I'm sure players have seen the AI routes like the 13, 54, 94 and 97 routes (for example) and though why they aren't fully playable. I don't see why a revisit to these routes to extend them to their actual destinations would not be considered.To make it a free or even a £5 at most fee would be great and would leave the map feeling more complete and open world. This is a feature that more average gamers to the genre will likely find an annoyance, and drops its recommendation value quite low.X10 ADDONI don't have every DLC, but I know the same can be said for the X10 Addon, as only 2 Berlin buses (the 115 and X10 are full routes)  and 2 routes (I think the 626 and another route) in Teltow ( a town in the Brandenburg area (or county as I'd relate it to) is fully playable.Lots of routes like the 110, 285, 601/X1, 621, 623 & 625 buses are only partially playable and it can be quite blatant.For example, the 285 travels from Dahlem Waldfriedhof to S+U Rathaus Steglitz in real life and the destination blinds even state Steglitz, but (and this is especially apparent when selecting the Appenzeller terminus, as the same thing happens) the route ends abruptly ends on a road called Wupperstr. in Zehlendorf, making the route quite short, shorter than the 5 or 92 from the Spandau map.This is a let down, as the route tends to use a double decker from time to time and using it can seem unnessecary depending on the time of day and amount of passengers spawned in the world.Despite the long paragraph detailing the 285, this occurs with the 110, which is almost criminally poor in how the route's terminus (Grunewald Roseneck) is a lie, as you see it at its real terminue (U Oskar Helene Heim) when driving commonly the 285, but possibly the 115, 623 and X10. But I'll leave it at that.3. The Community-TO BE CLEARThe community isn't the issue, but they are used by the developers, to create less add- on content, or relieve the feeling of leaving consumers underwhelmed, with the high price to pay for so little. The communities and their products to average consumers can be a minefield to understand, as downloading and learning where to store add on buses can be a cinch, but downloading maps and some repaints can be hard to understand and find out where to place them, leaving the consumer alienated and helpless. Believe me, this has happened to me and its not usually creator's fault, as they try to explain what to do for installations, but sometimes their native language is different.-BUSESThe various communities have varying buses with varying quality. Some can be excellent amd some can be poor. I've come across a few which fail to work normally, or have a slight issue that can't be resolved, which again, makes things tough for the consumers. The lack of double deckers, is quite apparent, as the only double decker fan made bus, is a Lion's City DD, that has a few issues, but an official version, as mentioned before, can be used with the X10 pack. Single deckers make up around 80% of the fan buses, which can be an issue to those who wish to drive a new or different double decker on a longer, busier route. Articulated buses are fine, but tend to be less reliable with high density passengers than double deckers.-MAPSFans have gone as far to recreate Spandau in a fictional and interesting way, (New Berlin- Spandau Map) as it utilises the many AI routes, but completely change the routes for some, which can be seen as a positive or negative. Assets have had to be reused from the original map, which is noticable sometimes, but is acceptable. The map however, for me at least rarely works and the text of issues relating to the map and any others that occur, tend to be in German, so English and other language speakers will have an annoying time tryong to figure and work it out.As stated before, maps can be a hassle to implement into the game's files.Seems I've reached the text limit."

It has lots of great details and effort behind it, but at the same time, game has lots of bugs and preforming-issues. Style of the game is realistic, and unrealistic at the same time. It's hard to explain. Objects are blocky and character models a bit clumsy, but it has unique atmosphere, and game feels alive. People that hop in the bus feel like they really have somewhere to be, and you are incharge of their schedule working out as planned. Buses have very detailed interior and exterior, and simulation of driving is very deeply thought out. Maps that come with the game are based on 1980-2000, and it really shows, car-models, instruments in buses, and everything else are retro. This is the best and most atmospheric bus simulator out there."

It has the potential to be the best Bus Simulator of them all, but the designers have issued a very flawed game. I have a very high spec gaming pc and yet, this sim lags regular throughout. Numerous ghost vehicles, ( all white). Map runs out and game over. I play all the sims including : Fernbus, Bus Simulator, Euro Truck Sim, American Truck Sim, and most of the Flight Sims as well and Omsi 2 is nowhere near their standard. Perhaps the makers of Omsi should give them a call and find out how it is done. It's a real shame as i believe this could have been so much better.  I would not recommend it at this moment."

The reason for this is it has a horrible bug if you have a low frame rate where the bus bounces out of control. This means that sometimes it can spoil the experience of driving. If you do have a good PC though, it is fantastic. There is so much freeware and DLC for this game which makes the driving experience all that more fun!"
