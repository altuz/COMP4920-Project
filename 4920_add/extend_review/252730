,Recommended,252730,7878168,"Posted: 2 December, 2013",all,philstuf,"For a game that’s just shy of 20 years old, this is proof-positive that some things are timeless.  As a long-time owner (yeah, I got it when it originally came out in 1995 on CD-ROM...), I can truly say the charm remains, as does the irreverence.  Despite the years, the sarcasm and prodding by the “host” is just as relevant now as it was then.  I always leave the game with a smile on my face.Not only does the Steam re-release introduce a whole new generation to YDKJ, but it ditches the CD-ROM and related issues (Try grabbing the original disc and installing it on a modern, 64-bit O/S.  Won’t happen without a LOT of work)...My only real gripe is that the game is perpetually stuck at a 640x480 resolution, and going full-screen requires a manual change of the PC’s resolution to 720x480**P.S.  DO NOT forget to snag the others in the franchise.  They're worth every penny!"
,Recommended,252730,7906166,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"Going back to You Don't Know Jack after so many years and sequels, it becomes clear how little the formula has changed over the almost two decade history of the franchise. That shouldn't be taken as an insult to the series, but a compliment to just how timeless and clever the original still is.If you've never played YDKJ, the gist is that it's a game show in your living room (or wherever your computer might resides. A raunchy, hilarious, shamelessly offensive, and remarkably clever trivia game that never misses a chance to break the forth wall to insult you, as it simultaneously pretends to congratulate your correct answer. The developers clearly loved what they were doing and that shows through in an abundance of little touches that add so much, from the fake commercials to the terrible names they bestow upon you, to the unrivaled abuse of pop culture in every question and the effortless delivery by your host Cookie. If you aren't laughing, you may very well be dead inside.The only ""con"" I can give YDKJ is that given its age, some of the questions and references are a bit dated. Those without ample knowledge of the 80's and 90's might find themselves a bit lost at times, so if you are hoping for something a bit more relevant one of the more recent games may be a better choice. Everyone else shouldn't hesitate to pick this up, grab two friends (and some drinks while you're at it), and get ready to burst into tears as you learn:You Don't Know Jack!"

Still holds up to this day (for the most part), and a large amount of questions will make sure you never see the same one twice. Great to break out when your friends are over.Due this being a re-release of a '90s triva game, some of the questions are no longer accurate and many of the jokes are timely pop-culture references.

In its day, it was one of the greatest games of all time, purely for the sound and music.  The action ""behind the scenes"" in terms of audio made this game visceral.  Streaming it over a 56K dialup connection was laboriously slow but worth the wait.  Later gaming consoles brought about titles like ""Buzz"" for the Sony Play Station.  But this was the grand daddy of them all.  From the host who made you feel like crap if you got an answer wrong, to the ability to ""Screw"" your apponents, this was one of the best party games available in the 90's.The best experiences were when you played with friends, though it does have a single player option.

,Recommended,252730,8244806,"Posted: 23 December, 2013",all,TerminalHunter,"My god.This game (along with the first Roller Coaster Tycoon) defined my childhood. There were a few PC games I played in the wee years of my life, when dial-up was the only way to connect to the World Wide Web. The original You Don't Know Jack was one of them. To be fair, I had a censored version, for some odd reason. I don't think the game was purchased for me, I just remember finding it. Still, it was the funniest thing I could think of -- this game came out in 1997 and I must have found it a few years after that because my earliest memories playing with a computer started a few years after that. I was barely in elementary school, yet I played this trivia game whenever I could. I guess you could say it started a life-long pattern of being able to recall weird, strange, and seemingly random facts. It's like when babies listen to mozart, except I was impressing myself with all sorts of weird knowledge.And You Don't Know Jack is really interesting in that regard. This game is more like Jeopardy! than it is other, less meaningful trivia. Except Jellyvision and everyone behind it knew how to combine those silly pop cultural references that the vast majority of people seem to harp on and actually injected some interesting knowledge into it. Questions of the classics, but asked in a hypothetical question with the Flinstones or some other television character inserted into it in order to have it make more sense or to properly frame it. The tagline, spoken in game, does it the most justice: When pop culture and high culture collide. It's a good trivia game, as in it actually tickles your brain and asks questions of a difficult yet interesting and worldly manner. But it also comes with a high octane humor and witty introspection that has me coming back to the game, even now, even before it was available this way on Steam. I showed this game to some friends a few months ago, except I had found my original disk and loaded it up on a Windows 98 virtual machine. I went to those lengths just to play those same trivia questions again. I might have gone through them all, except I played the censored version.... what more wonders do I have in store?So, I might be biased. This was a game I grew up with, and here it is - apparently restored and bundled with every other You Don't Know Jack Game (except for the 2013 edition) for $5. How could I say no?"
