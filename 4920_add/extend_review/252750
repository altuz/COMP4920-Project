,Recommended,252750,17474702,"Posted: 10 August, 2015",all,pixtar,"'MouseCraft' is a combination ofTetris and Lemmingsas puzzle game with mice.Desc:Your goal is to guide every 3 mice in each level to the exit (cheese). Each level gives you certain amount of blocks which can be rotated and placed everywhere. You have to collect in some levels blue crystals to unlock the next level.Within the first level you only have ""normal"" blocks like the Z, L or I of Tetris but over the time you unlock new blocks like a jelly block which prevents a mouse to die when it fall down more than 3 blocks. There are altogether 80 levels.Pros:+ low raising difficulty level+ beatable game+ cute animations+ built in level creator(+ achievements [all are fair])Cons:- too easy (only 5 or 6 levels are a bit harder)--- no Steam Workshop (game concept is crying out for! and it still has a built in level creator how silly)- only story mode (means 80 levels)Recommended!, only if it'son sale, because it's not really challenging.7/10"

You get a set amount of differant blocks to use and you must place them in a way so the mice can get to the cheese with out killing them. You also must try and collect the crystals as well. As you progress through the puzzles you earn more blocks, being differant type's, jelly blocks for                                                                        the softer landings and bomb blocks to blow stuff up and many more.There is also Steam Acheviements to be earned as well.

,Recommended,252750,14399368,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,ElleWolfe,"Bought this a while back when it was early access because it looked so amazing and I finally got around to playing it. I have to say, it's highly amusing and entertaining. Of course the first levels are simple, as with any game you have to understand the basics. This actually reminds me of the gifted program IQ testing, being able to predict an outcome many steps ahead (except with much less mouse death).  I find some levels incredibly easy and others I rage at and have to walk away from for a few minutes. At one point I was yelling and calling the developers of the game some choice names... all in good fun. I wouldn't exactly compare it to tetris, its about using your pieces wisely, not fitting them together neatly. If you are actually trying to complete all of the goals (all three mice, all the shards) it can be challenging... and I feel for the first mouse, who I have dubbed ""bomb squad mouse,"" for good reason.Summary:PROS-Adorable graphics-Yes, it is actually challeging if you seek perfection-No crashes, well made-I'd call it a brain game, exercising logic, prediction and cause/effect-Mice. And Schrödinger.-Is nothing like a phone game in my opinion. And may it never become one.CONS-May cause shouting at inanimate objects-Really that's it, except a minor bug. After level 30 or so my game stopped showing ""perfect score"" at the end of a level, the little TV says 0/3 etc, though the Stats accurately show scores so it's hardly a big deal. If anyone else has encountered this problem and fixed it let me know.BUY THE GAME."
76561197970170056,Recommended,252750,13182980,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,Stense,"Pros:-Fun fusion of puzzle styles.-Cute graphics.-Great music.-Easy to pick up.-Satisfying solutions to puzzles.Cons:-May be too easy for some, lacking in many real head scratchers until late in the game.-Simplistic in places.During the winter of 2012/2013, I went to war with the mouse expeditionary force that had invaded my flat. Taking advantage of the crumbling foundations of the old terrace building I live in, they attempted to take over. Eventually I managed to fight back the mice incursion and block off their access into my territory. I tell you this as I think it’s important to be transparent with the fact that the mice and I have history. So hopefully you can trust that when I say the mice in Mousecraft are adorable and I really wanted to keep them safe, I really mean it.Mousecraft is the new game from the wonderfully named Crunching Koalas. The idea is simple, guide mice through a level to the cheese. Because science. The gameplay is a curious mix of Tetris and Lemmings and I have been utterly charmed by this game. It’s bright and colourful, the music toe tappingly jolly and the fusion of puzzle classics works intuitively and offers some fun mazes to take on.Right off the bat, the game made me smile by featuring a cat scientist named Schrödinger. Poor old Shrödy has a problem, he desperately wants to continue his animal experiments but he doesn’t have enough dosh to fund them and build his mouse powered pipe dream. Fortunately for him, and indeed the scientific process in general, a mysterious benefactor steps in to offer to fund the experiments in exchange for crystals the mice collect.Each level gives you a set of obstacles to get across and a few “Tetrominos” blocks to form a path for the mice. Once let out of their mouse wheel, the mice won’t stop until they have the cheese at the end. And who could blame them? While things start very simplistic and a little too obvious with the solutions to each level, the game adds features regularly enough to keep interest up. It’s not long until you are faced with obstacles such as robot rats, exploding blocks, perilous falls or acid baths.This leads to some unfortunately ethical quandaries. Just why is this mad scientist cat doing these experiments in the first place? What possible reason could he have had to construct mice hating robot rats, and then to put them together in the same maze? Why does he need mouse activated high explosives as part of his mouse based experimentation. In short, I’m dubious as to whether Dr Schrödinger’s experiments meet the regulations required by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.Luckily, our mysterious benefactor doesn’t appear to care about such things and is happy to allow all sorts of out of control science to go ahead. So the game is free to chuck in more tools for aiding the mice, such as a jelly block to break their fall (mice can only free fall three tiles), block busting bombs to clear the path or crumbling blocks to separate the trio of mice and put them on different paths. It all feels well balanced and thought through, creating fun puzzles that are satisfying to pass but don’t frustrate. It may lack complexity and experienced puzzle gamers may not be too challenged on most levels, but the whole experience is satisfying and presented in such an amusing way that it doesn’t detract from the enjoyment of the game. Some levels can feel too similar to the last and there isn't much variety in the sound effects, but it introduces new elements regularly enough that any hints of repetition are dealt with quickly.With four sections of twenty levels each, there are plenty of puzzles to solve. On top of that there is a level creator to build your own fiendish puzzles, although there is not yet any in-game method of sharing levels with the community. User-made levels can be downloaded by getting files from people on the forums, but hopefully a more intuitive sharing system can be implemented in a future update.I’ve been enjoying my time with Mousecraft. It’s a cute and perfectly paced puzzle game with some great ideas and adorable graphics. It’s currently part of the Indie Piñata promotion (a selection of games on discount with further discounts if you own any of the others in the selection) and offers players around 5-6 hours of charming puzzling for the main game. It’s helped me put the mouse war of 2012/13 behind me and heal old wounds. For that, I am eternally grateful. Mice, all is forgiven.FromCoffee Break Gaming."

There's no time limit so you can sit back and carefully consider all the possible ways of achieving that goal.The levels start out very easy and get more challenging as you progress. You'll eventually find yourself staring at the screen, running possible permutations through your head until.... ""eureka!"", you figure it out and feel a right smarty-pants... until you see the next puzzle.Different kinds of Tetromino-shaped blocks are introduced throughout the game to keep it fresh and interesting. These include jelly, explosive and electric blocks. There are also water and acid hazards to add to the challenge.The game is addictive. When I finished it I wanted to go back and gold-star every level. And when that's done there are a bunch of Achievements to be had as well. Most of them you'll get playing through the story mode, but there are others to aim for, too, like frying 10 mice!For one of the Achievements you have to make your own puzzle in the Level Editor. You know, Nintendo are really pushing level design in games like Pushmo World, Mario vs Donkey Kong, Smash Bros and soon, Mario Maker. Well, you can do it in MouseCraft, too. It would be nice if levels could be shared via Steam Workshop instead of in the forums, but it's a minor gripe.Overall, I really enjoyed Mousecraft and wholeheartedly recommend it to puzzle game fans."
,Recommended,252750,28675340,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,eaturbyfill,"At first glance, MouseCraft looked like it may be aimed at too low of an age audience for me to find challenging. I was wrong. The game continues to introduce new mechanics every so often, stepping up the complexity of the puzzles and keeping levels varied. Another plus is the ability to design your own levels. I think this game could appeal to a wide age bracket and does an excellent job at stimulating creative thinking. I never encountered any bugs or issues with the game & highly recommend it."

At first it's ok, some what interesting but quickly becomes tiresome.  Late game puzzles have you timing things to split one of your three mice down a different path to trigger some explosion or collect an item, then you remove the block that split your mice and all three get to the end - rinse & repeat. Lemmings had you doing different things with your lemmings, these mice just run in one direction.  There is no real story so it's just progressive puzzle solving but the progression takes too long and is far too limited."

This is a game that should be ad-paid on mobile, but it's $15 on Steam instead. I'm not even exaggerating. The puzzles and mechanics are ridiculously simple. I'm not talking casual-level simple, I'm talking 'may entertain a small child' simple.This is NOT a cross between Tetris and Lemmings. You don't have block falling from the sky that you have to accomodate, you just pick them up and place them where you want them at any time you wish. You also don't have a team of skilled laborers. You just have 3 idiot mice that walk forward and can climb 1 block and fall up to 3. The ONLY thing this game draws from Tetris is the shape of the tetrominoes, and the ONLY thing it draws from Lemmings is rodents that continually walk forward.Both Tetris and Lemmings are better games than this, and you can play both of them for free.This is a rip-off."
76561198060219701,Recommended,252750,18039561,"Posted: 14 September, 2015",all,lostcraft,"Highly recommended, with an additional ""Very"" if you know what a Lemming is and if you still wake up to the crunch of Tetris blocks dropping from your room's ceiling.Here's a new batch of rodents to scratch your puzzle itch. And you can't drop 4-pieces for a Tetris.There's this mad scientist cat Schrödinger running experiments FOR SCIENCE, all of them involving three mice making their way through a puzzle-maze thingie. It's your job to make sure at least one mouse makes it safely from its little wheel to a faraway piece of cheese.That's the core premise. Your mice are blissfully stupid and just walk in a straight line until they hit an obstacle they can't jump over, which causes them to turn. You're given a couple of ""tetris"" pieces, and must drop them into the right spot to create a path to the exit. Mice don't jump very high- one block, that's it. Mice also can die from a long drop, or being squished by a tetris piece. It's a dangerous lab for sure.One thing that MouseCraft does absolutely great is establishing the puzzle formula and then adding to it. As usual the first few levels are really easy, and once you've got the basics down, more and more elements are added. In order to make it into later levels you need a certain amount of glowing blue crystals, which your mice can pick up on their way. Enemies (robot rats) start to roam the levels. Blocks can be destroyed with pickup bombs, slippery ice blocks and bouncy jello blocks are added to your arsenal. And more often than not there is a simple solution to a level, but in oder to rescue all three mice and collect all the goodies, you'll need to think around corners a bit. At around level 12 I found myself starting to really think, instead of just recognizing a standard challenge ""that has been done in other games"". It's a solid puzzler and it seems to deploy its collection of blocks, timing, environmental hazards and the greed to score ""perfect"" to great effect.It's also a downright cute game. The 3D models are nicely animated, from the sweet little mice to the downright hilarious Schrödinger, who always keeps an eye on the experiment with gleeful joy or puzzled amazement. The sound effects are okay, but not outstanding; the music however, really can get stuck in your head. It's all really whimsical and cartoonish; my only gripe is that the mice themselves just lack the personality of their Lemmings ancestors.Controls are simple and easy. Blocks are picked and places with a single mouse click, and the interface allows quick restart and even has a ""fast forward"" button to speed up the slow pace of the rodent odyssey. You also get an ""active pause"" that freezes time but allows you to still place blocks- all you need is there in the form of friendly large buttons.Despite the child-friendly presentation (no violence at all, even a dead mouse just turns into... a cartoon mouse ghost) the puzzle difficulty starts to ramp towards the end of the first ""map"" (20 levels), and the game boasts a total of 80 levels- so I haven't even made it to the halfway mark and can't say how tricky things will be later on. It's probably too hard for children, who may still enjoy watching someone play the game. It has this thick cute charming feel.80 levels are a good amount of content, too, especially when you're the kind of player who MUST have all the perfect scores. And if 80 levels are NOT enough, you can make your own with an easy-to-use level editor. With Steam integration in place, you can easily make your own contraptions and share them as you see fit.The price is probably a bit higher than one expects from a ""simple puzzler"" these days- but the overall quality of the game easily justifies the price tag. You get a really polished, solid brain-twister here, you can make your own levels, and did I mention how insanely cute the mice are? Really, give it a go!"

There are a good number of specialty blocks/items that make figuring out a safe passage for your mice an interesting puzzle, but luckily the player is allowed to learn these since new blocks/items are phased into gameplay rather being dumped all at once.There is not really much of a story as far as I can tell; I've made it halfway through the stages and it has been trap after trap.

Crumble blocks break as soon as two mice walked on them, TNT blocks explode after three seconds as soon as they're touched, goo blocks avoid your mice falling to death and so forth, while the goal is always the same: reach the cheese platter with as many mice - max 3 - as possible while trying to fetch all the Anima (blue, crystaline, floating thingies) scattered throughout the levels.The levels are pretty short and to the point, the difficulty has a pleasant learning curve and the game has its very own charme from a graphics and sound perspective. The game is not overly difficult, but some of the puzzles will make you scratch your head more than once or twice nontheless.Over all, I don't regret a cent spending on MouseCraft and am hoping that the devs will continue to build on this promising puzzle game and its odd, but loveable, characters."

Both of those games are classics, everybody should know Tetris and while Lemmings isn't as widely know, it can be considered a cult hit.For those that weren't playing games during 90s, in short Lemmings was game where lemmings needed to be lead safely to exit. That was done by assigning different tasks like digging to few of the lemmings. As that has to be done at the same time when lemmings were dumbly walking forward, things could get quite hectic. In more difficult levels that lead quite ofthen to giving up by blowing up all the remaining lemmings.What Mousecraft has taken from Lemmings is that mice have to be lead to cheese.  They're as dumb as lemmings and will keep on walking forward, no matter if they will drop to acid pool for example.How those dangers are avoided is that blocks can be dropped and that block will for example cover pool of acid. Or more commonly those blocks can form stairs that mice will climb up to the cheese. Challenge comes from shape of the blocks and fitting them with the obstacles. Blocks have been predefined to suit the level. How they suit the level and help the mice with their objective is up to you to figure out.Regular blocks are just the beginning as later levels introduce blocks that have new features.Game can be finished in a weekend, though finishing all the levels perfectly provides additional challenge. To me it felt like most difficult part of the game is somewhere in the middle. Last part of the game has less challenging puzzles, challenge comes more from timing everything right in order not to squash the mice with the blocks.There's no Workshop support, so sharing levels created with the level editor is not as easy it could be.Get it, if you like puzzle games."

The graphics, music and effects for a puzzle game is great.The game divided into 4 sections and the beta version only available 2 sections and 1 more level from the 3rd section, which means 41 levels. There should be 80 levels in the full game.As the game goes, new features will be unlocked, giving more variety things to the puzzle.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After the launch of the game, I played through the whole game in several hours. Most of the remaining 39 levels are not tricky. So if you hope for some hardcore puzzle game, this may not give you satisfactory, and it's a little bit expensive for the game this short.Hopefully there's a level editor. I'm looking forward to release some more difficult puzzles."

,Recommended,252750,30250663,Posted: 28 February,all,KatFrog,"Mousecraft is a fun puzzle game where you are trying to save the lab rats from all the perils of living in a lab.  Yes, yes, supposedly you are helping the crazy cat scientist do his ""experiments"" and test his ""inventions"" but you really are just saving the lab mice from untimely deaths.The first levels are fun and interesting, but the game ramps up in difficulty.  Every time you learn about a new type of block or situation, you have a level or two to learn and then BAM!  You have to step it up or turn into the Death of Lab Mice.I recommend this game to puzzle platform lovers everywhere."

Still liked the scientist cat peering at the mice from the background. Helped give it a little bit of a creepy vibe :)Not voice acted. No Xbox360 pad support. Has solid resolutions support. Cutscenes were kind of cheap slideshow. The puzzle themselves, the engine, and the overall tone and feel of the game all felt appropriate, slick and rather straightforward. The interface makes sense and so do the controls."
