,Not Recommended,252770,15387851,"Posted: 15 April, 2015",all,Dragir,"Ok, i bought this game not too long ago, despite the reviews because i saw it had some promise. I thought the system in it to make your own block and design your own armor and weapons via voxel editing was pretty neat. This has been a growing trend in video games as of late. I also thought it was pretty neat that you could build your character like you could. Again, pretty neat. Thought i saw something on the unity asset store just like it.Now that the nice stuff is out of the way...The game is broken. It crashes, constantly. EVERYONE is having those problems. Have some fan boys here, but lord are they really niave to think that this is how normal development is supposed to work. I'm an indie developer. I have an upcoming title that i have been working on, and already have the networking code framework complete and ready to be fleshed out with instantiating objects and players and world events and all that sweetness. Needless to say i have been at this for quite some time. I have 3d modelling experience, animation and loads of forum management, community management, and server management experience. A decade worth.And I know when people are jerking me around for the most part.Now. I burned myself a tad. But thats ok. I mean, i bought a chucklefish game for the gods sake...I bought this game without first looking at their forums. And when i played the game, it crashed. It was a laggy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I could be lucky if i could find anything that didn't look like a cruddy generic weapon. (Pretty sure i was meant to make my own. so not really a big deal.) And like many others couldn't run the game without a CTD within 5 minutes which is tell tale of a memory leak.So what do i do? Look on steam forums. See they are pretty quiet. ""Hey lets check out the website and see what is happening there!"" Website looked pretty damn good. It represented its game well, and misrepresented it at the same time.Its misrepresentation is pretty much the same as the misrepresentation on the steam store. There is no multiplayer. It was disabled last build because of some issues and stuff like that or something. Not a big deal because they are saying they are going to bring it back next update...Now when i say they, i mean y2bcrazy, because this alleged other developer ""AlwaysGeeky"" is either never on steam posting, or they are really the same person and its and anonymous shield for y2bcrazy to deflect hate with. Which is a pretty sound tactic if you have feelings... Feelings are obsolete and have no place in the gaming industry. There is a difference between caring about your community and letting your feelings run your business. But lets not talk philosophy.Now here is the cold harsh impression of the game and the developers that everyone has been waiting for..I checked their forums.. They were filled to the brim with over 2k plus PORN BOTS. They deteriorated so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that if i had checked those forums before buying the game, i would have never bought it and the rest of you poor guys would not be reading this review, and would probably most likely be making a huge mistake. I mentioned it on the steam forums for them, and got an answer, which was surprising after seeing the state of the forums... His response to the forums porn issue? Shut them off. He took them down, Those forums no longer exist. Took the easy way out.BUT WAIT! Theres more! I even offered on the steam forums to help them. Added y2bcrazy and AlwaysGeeky as a friend, And told y2bcrazy when he accepted about all the♥♥♥♥♥♥i can do and would have even sent them screenshots of a lot of my work when they replied.I got flat out ignored. I would have helped them clean up their forum and get it properly secured which would have taken me about 20 minutes tops.The end result. These ""Developers"" are ♥♥♥♥ing lazy. I know how hard it is to develop a game. I have been doing it by my damn self with nobodies help for a while now. I know its not easy unless you count grass simulator or shower with your dad simulator...But there is really no freaking excuse for not checking your forums and your site and letting them deteriate that damn far... None. Get some volunteer mods. Childs play. Risking your forums being defaced by a rogue mod who might not even have access to an admin CP is nothing compared to having your professional image sullied by porn bots.Thier excuse is they are re-working the game engine. I'm sorry, but i don't believe them at this point. That, and they are ""developing a game they want to play..."" See now, that strikes close to my heart, because i am developing a game i want to play aswell. BUT it irritates me to NO ♥♥♥♥ING END, when people use that as an excuse to treat people who are asking questions, (even if they are being rude.) like dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ It is unprofessional. It is disgusting, they use that saying like it is a catch all to describe how much they care about their project but then contradict themselves when they treat their customers (again even the rude customers.)♥♥♥♥♥♥poorly. It is like saying ""I really care about my game but i don't care if people don't buy it because i'm a public ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.""ProTip: If you can't be understanding of frustrated customers, either hire a community manager who can, or go back to working your day job at McDonalds and stay the hell out of the game industry. Seriously, if you can't simply hire someone or select a volunteer to be the voice of your passionate hot headed devs, you don't belong here. But you probably won't listen to me anyway. Have fun filing for bankruptcy with your mom at the age of 25... That will probably be embarrasing.Pros:Customization is only as limited as your imagination, EPIC.Cons:Lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥Devs.Waste of money,♥♥♥♥♥♥multiplayer is disabled because,♥♥♥♥♥♥Quests are♥♥♥♥♥♥Monsters are♥♥♥♥♥♥Resource gathering, Seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥Memoryleak,♥♥♥♥♥♥Not mod friendly,♥♥♥♥♥♥Third to first person camera control, horrible♥♥♥♥♥♥Character doesn't actually aim where your camera is facing, basic♥♥♥♥♥♥Devs treat customers on the steam forums who only want to know what the hell is going on like, YOU GUESSED IT.♥♥♥♥♥♥Fanboys who will roll over and accept any excuse like they know what development is all about, Again,♥♥♥♥♥♥Maybe if you sacrifice your first born son, you might get something worth while out of this game. MAYBE.I understand the game isn't finished. But when hell freezes over and my great grand children are down there licking yellow snow cones and starbound hits 1.0 and is everything chucklefish ever promised us with actual results instead of excuses and a useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥ blog...*Breathe in...* (Well maybe not the starbound part, that is really unfair... I guess.)Basically. I will change this review if the game turns out to actually be worth changing it for.♥♥♥♥♥♥i'm not even mad about this game. So here you have it. My review. Enjoy spending your money elsewhere.""Oh but dragir, you only have two hours ingame!""So what? One of the devs only has 20 hours. I'm pretty sure i am not missing out on anything. And i doubt anyone can really run it that long. Rebooting the game every five damn minutes from CTD is a waste of my time. Until its fixed i will be spending my time on things that matter. I also don't need to play the damn game to form an opinion when there are numerous youtube videos and lets plays all over the place that i can form an opinion from. Pick another arguement from your hat of straw men."
,Not Recommended,252770,31124625,Posted: 13 April,all,Khorne,"This game had a great potential, but the developer has the same problem than the developer of Cube World : communication and honesty.You cannot launch a game in Early Access, expect people to give money and don't give information about the development, state of the game etc....The developer has the time to congratulate other people on Twitter for their works, retweet things etc... but not the time (or don't understand the interest) to make a propre news/thread on Steam to show to customers where is Vox going (or if it's dead).- Last update came out last year during summer with no changelog and not a news since.- Nothing done on Github since 7 months (except space added in a readme file)- Not a single topic explaining the situation in Steam DiscussionFor all these reasons I cannot recommend people to buy this. The goal of an Early Access is to play and contribute to a game development. There is no development (or at least no sign of it) and no communication from and with the developer possible. So you better play and buy games from developer that respect the fundamental of Early Access."

So I will review what the product is at its current state.Pros:* Finding various things in chests is fun.* The effects when shooting magic are pretty.* Haven't found a bottom to the map yet.* Character and weapon customization are quite in depth.Cons:* Almost always there is about 10 minutes of gameplay until the game crashes.* Once you find all of the items in the chests there is practically nothing to do. (there are chests everywhere)* No Multiplayer! (The game advertizes Co-op & Multiplayer while at the current state there is Neither)* Glitch into the map often and just kind of sit there thinking about things - kind of like when I'm in the shower.* No actual updates in about a year or so... (There are a few pictures showing ""updates"" but not much more)* No triple monitor support. (Personal preference but I like playing games at 6000 x 1080)* Very empty world. (like there are a couple environmental things like trees, cacti, skeletons, one house. Otherr thanthat this game is in very early stages of development.)* Building mechanics are something to looks away from.

Don't waste your hard-earned money. Even the ""developer"" removed himself from the store page. The developer himself seems to be one of those people who aspires to be a developer, poses as one on his Twitter page, but this game isn't even a quarter-way finished. He also claims that Vox is both a game and a game engine as a way to excuse this failed attempt.I'd even go so far as to say he probably made this game to cash in on the voxel-based game craze around the time Minecraft became popular. He probably made this thinking people would flock to this as well and fill in the gaps, in a similar fashion as Garry's Mod.OLD REVIEW:I've had this game in my library for more than two years. Mostly unplayable, no updates. I'd pay Steam to remove this game from my library if I could."

,Not Recommended,252770,31052181,Posted: 9 April,all,Four Horseman,"Well, I have owned this game for years, seen it's good times and bad times. I have waited to post a review of the game due to the fact that it's simply so far from finished.I find myself no long able to wait. When I first bought VOX the devs were very active with the community...positive and upbeat, always answering their critics with fair answers.  Slowly however, as game sales started to drop and the patches became fewer and farther in-between the dev(s) simply disappeared from the forums.  A year went by without a word from the dev, and also without any updates to the game...then 2 years.All of a sudden a big update hits, great news right? When the community asked for patch notes the dev responded with sarcasm, saying: ""everyting has changed"", and he was not kidding. He did not even want to take the time to release a changelist after not updating the game for 2 years.Well, it's been about a year since the last patch...the engine is now open source but the game is still for sale here on Steam.  The dev still refuses to interact with his supporters on Steam, but you can find him screwing around on Twitter all of the time.I had high hopes for VOX, I really did; as of now though I have uninstalled it. No doubt the dev is upset that the game has not gone as planned...but when you ignore your paying customers for years at a time it only compounds the problem."

It's really a pity, because the graphics are really interesting and it has some interesting bits that most voxel-based games do not have, like trees completely falling down once you cut through the base, and the ability to customize your character in really interesting ways.Sadly it's not worth pursuing, and really didn't have enough content to be worth this price to begin with.

,Recommended,252770,9591388,"Posted: 22 March, 2014",all,thezorch,"NOTICE: This game is a work in progress. In buying it you are investing in further development, which you will benefit from as the game is updated as certain development milestones are reached. Being an Early Access title expect random crashes and bugs. Ignore all neagative reviews complaining about the bugs, apparently some people don't understand what Early Access means.Vox as its title suggests, is a voxel-based sandbox game in the same category as Infiniminer and Minecraft. The game uses a more rastarized art style as apposed to the more blocky style of Minecraft. The game engine uses modern shader effects and lighting in ways Minecraft doesn't without a GLSL Mod. Where Vox differentiates itself from Minecraft is its focus on adventure and role-playing. Instead of starting the game as one character which you cutomize with skins, you create a new character the way you would in most other RPGs and give that character a name. You then create the world you want to enter and you're given some control over the biomes and overall size of the worlds you create.Each new game starts you out in a town populated by named NPCs. Chests with loot litter the nearby countryside, whcih gives you some nice starting gear. Some of the chests are monsters, so be aware of this when looting them. Combat uses a Zelda-style lockon which helps in aiming your attacks, especially when using the bow and arrow. Sound effects at the moment during combat are minimal, though this may change throughout the development cycle of the game.Vox has a fairly detailed crafting system which has some similarities to Minecraft, but goes a few steps further and also allows you to make improvements to certain times like tools and weapons. Like Minecraft you smelt ores you've harvested into bars which you then use to craft items. You can also harvest plants and harvest wood. You can also edit any item in your inventory at virtually any time.Sound wise, Vox is baren with just a single repeating upbeat tune that drones on during the day, and a more melodic and slow tune that plays at night. Day and night cycles go by rather quickly, hopefully this will be fixed, and nighttime doesn't seem to change the game much. Its not like Minecraft where nightime becomes hazardous for the player if you haven't built shelter. This may also change in the future. I'm hoping for more variety in the music rather than the SNES-esque tune that plays now. Over time it can become annoying and you'll find yourself turning the music volume down most times.Overall, Vox holds immense promise so I recoomend that anyone who likes Minecraft please spend some pocket to get this game and help contribute its further development. Additionally, I much give the developer kudos for making the engine for this game open-source. We need to see more of this."

It has crashed a few times but not enought to make me stop playing the game. The crashes abort your current quest but your inventory and the world inventory stays intact. So if you stored stuff in chests its still there after the crash.The customization of the character is the fun part. This allows you to create an avatar of your choice. Although as you get armour, helmets, boots and gloves they will cover your customizations. I added a thumb to my hand that stuck out but when you added a glove that disappeared.Crafting is detailed and you can make a lot of equipment, weapons, armour, potions and even furniture.This is definitly worth the money and have already gotten value for money.Well done, keep up the excellent work."

Memory leaks and undefined crashs make an end to the fun.I will update this review with every patch because i belive it has a huge potential but at this time for me its unplayable.FPS was okay as long as SSAO is turned of.My system is an Alienware M11X R3Processor: i7-2617M (2,6GhZ Turbo 1,5 GhZ)Graphics: Geforce GT 540 MRAM: 4 GB"

It -is- in Alpha, crashes are expected. But until the game reaches beta, to me, it isn't worth the $10 to get it. I got mine on a sale. So if you're going to get it, wait for a sale and try it out yourself once, with it in mind, that it's an alpha game.My only real quirrel right now is that, the News page for the game has not seen an update since July of 2014, and I haven't noticed any sign of updates thus far. I haven't looked extensively either, admittedly.Put simple, I cannot suggest this game until it reaches more stable versions and more content is there, such as Multiplayer."
