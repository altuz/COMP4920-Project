The game expects you to know everything right off the bat when you launch it the first time. That means, no tutorial. Practice mode? You run in a map collecting points for nothing. No bots, no goal, nothing.  Don't ever get this game."

This should be f2p.I recommend it but not for full price, get it on sale with a couple of friends.DON'T BUY IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE FRIENDS."

If you are interested in the game buy it have a play around for an hour or so, you will have played the whole game by that point and can decide whether or not you want to refund it. PS. No Oceanic servers for my Australian bretheren so keep that in mind."

I wish they were more people that play this game and showed interest in it. I still however recommened this game, I just really hope it gets more people to play on the servers sooner."

76561198030414441,Recommended,252850,25895713,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,Ralgaoud,"Streamline looks more complicated in gameplay videos than it actually is. Within a few rounds you can get a good grip of the game. The game can include up to 16 players. 15 Runners plus a Hunter. The Hunter has the ability to kill the Runners in one hit. The runners compete for points by collecting orbs of differing values while using a dash meter. The dash meter is filled by pickups and you gain more points if you collect orbs while dashing. The movement in the game is context sensitive, as you can wall-run and do similar acrobatic feats while holding a button. If you are killed, you become a ghost. A ghost can no longer collect orbs, but can gain an increasing amount of points by punching a randomly assigned, still-alive runner. The game is played in 3 rounds that last a few minutes and the point total is cumulative, so if you die early in the first round, you can try to make up for it in the second round (and perhaps sabotage the runners who have amassed more points than you). If you are still alive at the end of a round, ghosts disappear and a sudden death commences, where you are finally able to kill the hunter by landing a hit on him, you just have to survive long enough and land a hit. The Hunter is scored via a letter grade (F- to A+ it seems), while the runner with the most points wins.There is intergration with twitch, as you can host or join lobbies by linking your twitch account in-game and then using the developer's twitch player athttps://streamote.tv/. You do not have to install anything, as some people seem to be confused on how this works. The end result is that you are able to find lobbies via this website, join a party, and play with a streamer (or if you are a streamer yourself, host). Viewers are able to view the stream of the game and use a point system to influence the game through different global buffs/debuffs that they choose when to activate. They can also bet on who they think will win and rack up more points via bingo in the lobby.To put it simply it's a competitive score-based platformer with asymetrical gameplay (Hunter, Runner & Ghost). It also involves optional stream integration, so that viewers may influence the gameplay. It's still early-access at this point, but feels solid and I have enjoyed the quirky experience so far. Recommended."

,Recommended,252850,30128626,Posted: 23 February,all,Uzee,"Streamline is fast-paced game with 2 (technically 3, but two of them are similar) game modes. In the first one a player tries to hit all the other players with a stop sign, while everyone else collects points by doing parkour across various terrains. The second game mode is similar to quidditch in that players try to score goals with a golden ball, but they still do parkour rather than fly on brooms.Players move very fast and rounds are full of additional effects that influence each game (chosen either randomly or by viewers' vote if the game is being streamed on twitch). Things such as the floor turning into lava, players exploding if they touch each other and the camera view rotating at disturbing angles make the gameplay diverse during each game.Moreover, you customize your character with items gained from packs which you open out of play similarly to Hearthstone. From making your character run around in their underpants to having them wear antlers, a gas mask or a hoodie. You can even change your race and gender at any time. Also you have a taunt action which makes your charater do a little performance such as doing the chicken walk or dabbing. It's perfect for when you want want to show off while winning the game.I got Streamline during a free weekend that was held a few months ago and I've been hooked ever since. I already reached the maximum currently available character level but don't plan on stopping. I just find it that much fun.P.S. As mentioned above all in-game items are cosmetic, so they don't influence the player's perfomance in the game, i.e. the game is not pay2win. So only play if you've got da skillz :P"

The community and the devs are involved all the time and always responsive. Fun game with good mechanics and great viewer interaction.

76561197992076180,Recommended,252850,26152307,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,eauclean,First and foremost a super fun game. Gameplay is tight and fluid both as the hunter and as a runner. What really makes it shine is the Twitch integration: people can play along while watching and actually influence the arena in the game they're watching. Easily the best-in-class game for streamers and their fans to play together.

I played for a bit, after trying to find a server with other people playing, which took half an hour, i got into a match. With 3 other players.It feels like a mini-game ripped from a bigger MMO, only without MMO. I thought it was f2p to be honest, and then i went to check out the store page, and saw a 20 euro price tag.It feels like reading an unfinished book, that someone stopped writing after the first two chapters, and put it for sale just to make up money for wasted time. Early access, meaning: ""pay to check out someone's idea, that might never work out""."

,Not Recommended,252850,30170228,Posted: 25 February,all,Jojy Guy,"So I was looking around twitter and I found that steam had a ""Free till November 18"" or something like that. I got the game, cause I thought it was a limited time play time... So like where you only have 5 hours to play it or something like that, but after that day it was still there. I didn't get it for my friend, who uses an account at my house. I was a bit bummed and was requesting it be free again. Nothing happened, and I never played it since. It's really laggy in game and a little on the menu. Game is really boring and enraging, not what I want from a parkour game (raging is understandable but this is because of fighting other players). I might go back to it, if they add a story mode or playing it locally with bots or something like that. I will give this a 4/10 until that is added. I can't recommend it yet."
