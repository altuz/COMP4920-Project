But it is so, so charming - you know with the charm of B movies: naive, cute, full of hilarious dialogs, overdone accents and caricature characters.The voice acting makes this game unforgetable, it is so ironically bad (I am sorry, actors) that it is almost spectacular. Igor is a star of this game, I bet he will be your favourite character and all his phrases will put a big smile on your face.The game itself is a point & click adventure with tons of puzzles and mini-games. The puzzle part is interesting and pretty challenging. Some of the puzzles confused me and I was close to rage quit (but I guess it is because I am too impatient).Art is really pleasant here, locations with hidden objects are drawn beautifully, every detail is carefully designed.Achievements are fun and interesting to do. Verdict - time well spent!Dracula: Love Kills is a lovely puzzle game, seasoned with plenty of irony, fake transilvanian accent and one hardcore decision - to bite or not to bite."

A very pretty point-and-click game, I really enjoyed it, and played it a couple times.After the game ends and you're thrown to the main menu - press ""continue"" again, because that's how you start the second chapter. The person who will be at your side here will depend on whether you've been a good boy or a bad bad dragon."
,Recommended,252890,26744333,"Posted: 22 November, 2016",all,Mifititi,"Definitely recommended.Perhaps plot wise this isn't anything new - saving the world from evil is hardly a new theme - but what makes this interesting that you play as Dracula himself. He could be good or bad and that depends literally on the player. Choices matter! That is really an interesting aspect that I haven't really seen a lot on hidden object games. So the story isn't new in its genre, but everything else makes up for it.So, the characters. Besides Dracula, they're not particularly multilayered, but it doesn't matter. HOGs are rarely as much about characters as they are about playing a detective. In this case, the relationships between characters are quite interesting and change, depending on your choices. It was quite humorous at points too, especially the quarrels between Van and Igor.The art is really, really nice. Dark on one areas, light on others, more realistic on some and fantasy like on the rest. It was extremely nice to look at. Though the Queen Of Vampires' hair is a bit ridiculous..Gameplay is pretty easy, but some of the puzzles are hard. And the thing is, that even if there's a strategy guide, it doesn't always offer help. I think it's a slight minus because you immediately lose a chance to get one achievement. If there's a strategy guide, it should have solutions to ALL puzzles, no exception. But there was quite a lot of puzzles I haven't seen in other games - or can't remember at the moment - and nice power ups to collect that helped you along the game.I don't know if it's my PC or not, but the cut scenes seem a bit... buggy, I guess it's the word. Voice comes on time, but the rest of it doesn't. It's better than in the physical copy, so I didn't mind.Since I mentioned the physical copy, I have one. I can't use it anymore but the fact that I bought a version on Steam should tell you something. It was one of the first HOGs I've ever played and I still like it a lot. For the price it has, I don't think it's a bad game at all."

I solved a couple of them with 1-2 clicks before I even know what the goal was.  Where the game fall short is the achievements, if your first playthrew is not under 5 hours, you have to start a new profile. You have to go threw the game twice at minimum, but most likly 3-4 times if an achievement dose not unlock properly.If you are looking for 100% achievement games, I would tell you to pass on this one. If you are just looking for a good point & click I do sudgest this game."

And as ever, the inner perfectionist got the better of me and demanded of me to achieve all there is to achieve. So there we are.Aside from a small glitch that I lost one of my achievements just before I would have completed all, thus having to play the entire game plus extra game a third time, it was plenty of fun. The storyline is not too overloaded, but it also is a very clear line. And you even have a moral choice here. It is nothing as deep and imersive as Mass Effect or similar Triple-A titles, but it does get across a point. At least for me.The graphics, the music and the atmosphere of the game all harmonize perfectly. To me, ""Dracula: Love Kills"" is one of the most enjoyable point and click adventures with Hidden Object and Puzzle elements out there. And now, after playing it straight for several hours today, I will fall into bed and pass out to have some well-earned sleep."

There is a bonus chapter along with replayable hidden object scenes and mini-games/puzzles.  Voice acting isn't that great, but I've heard worse.  Your character learns powers that allow slightly different interaction with some objects, so you must identify where to use them and which one (if you choose the wrong one it just won't allow you to use it, so you don't waste anything by trying).  There is an annoyance (at least on my computer) where the mouse cursor sometimes pauses or hangs while mousing over objects.  Other than that, fun game."

It has very bad voice acting, so if it was just music, it would be better, and the annoying ""slurrrp"" sound every time you find blood... the story line was a bit annoying. I am very bad at puzzle games, but i love them, and the puzzles in this one are fun. i know a lot of people who love puzzle games too, but story, voice acting and more can drive them away.

,Not Recommended,252890,8565796,"Posted: 4 January, 2014",all,nerdfury,"A little bit of background information: I generally stay away from hidden-object games as I consider them to be monotonous. However, I have enjoyed many ""point and click"" adventure games in which hidden-object scenes appear every so often.I would consider Dracula: Love Kills as an adventure game with an abundance of varied puzzles as well as hidden object scenes. It's not a pure hidden-object game. While it started off in an interesting manner, and while it indeed has many challenging puzzles, I cannot recommend the game, because I feel it completely lacks any atmosphere. As a result, getting to the end of the game felt like a monotonous chore.What do I mean when I say lacking in atmosphere? Well, I found the storyline and character interaction/progression absurd, and most importantly, I felt like the developers just lumped in a bunch of random objects to form hidden object scenes -- random objects which have no place being there, given the time period and locale (Example: objects of Chinese origin within a medieval tomb). It made the entire game feel rather tacky.Dracula: Love Kills isn't an awful game, and I think the developers did quite well in coming up with some of the original puzzles. However, I think there's many higher quality ""casual adventure games"" out there (Azada and Nightmare Adventures: The Witch's Prison are two games that I recall having an engaging atmosphere and storyline)."

All this requires the victim to stand there patiently, listening to another ""oof!"" and crash of branches in the night.Player-specific reasons to buy this game:- If you play DOTA, Dracula sounds like Tusk's little brother. This makes all the dialogue scenes much more interesting.- You can play tic-tac-toe with crabs, against crabs. If you do not pay attention, you can also be owned at tic-tac-toe by crabs.The less-than-perfect thing about this game:- If a vampire is measured against his or  her enemies, you kind of feel sad about Van Helsing there.Also there are hidden objects and puzzles, also lots of pretty art, if vampires wandering into hedges isn't enough for you."

I've seen better, but mostly I've seen worse.  The 3 characters had great (for a HOPA game) over-the-top dialog and the voice acting was nicely done too.  There were plenty of actual HOPA scenes.  The point-and-click part of the game was at least a bit different (with vampire powers) that what you usually get in these games.  The puzzles ranged from easy to fairly difficult for me, one of which I skipped because I could not wrap my head around it.  Recommended."

,Recommended,252890,23715280,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,HimeJezabel,"Aww yiss. What a quality game. I'm generally a fan of HOGs and played this somewhere between average to bad games and this game was such a breath of fresh air in the sense of quality.This game is apparently a sequel to 'Dracula Origins' published by the same company, but I've not played that game (yet). I still had no trouble following the story; Dracula is woken up by his servant and together with him and Van Helsing they set on a quest to find Mina; the love of Dracula's life who had been kidnapped by the Queen of Vampires.As you progress in the game you unlock new vampire powers to use in your quest.The game has many positives; superb voice acting from all characters, a lot of humour in the dialogues, high quality in the looks of both scenes and characters, and the sweet words of 'Location complete' when you have completed a location (duh). The game also shows on the map where there are things to be done, even in the hardest of modes. The different locations across the world are also pretyt interesting and well done.The game also has at least two possible endings, depending on your choices throughout the game. These choices also comes into the viewpoint of the bonus chapter.I left the game on a lot while afk, so my game time means nothing; but I was actually surprised to see I got the achievement for finishing within 5 hours.All puzzles can be skipped or hinted through, but then will not get you the achievement. You cna however spam hint as much as you like outside of the HO scenes.Negative for the game is probably that the HO scenes can get easy as you, if you click slow enough on hard mode or spamclick on easy, can pretty much click on every item and eventually get the scene complete without looking at the items you need. The scenes are usually so cluttered though, that it's not that easy this way. All scenes are played at least twice, so you get familiar with them.Another negative, though small, is how easily Van Helsing and Dracula teams up after just been mortal enemies.The game also pauses on alt+tab, so you may not ditch out of the cutscenes or dialogues that way (there is an achievement for not skipping any of that). It is useful for the 'finish in 5 hours' achievement though.Small note; the game Dracula's Legacy, another HOG, has nothing to do with this game and is from another company completely. I did have a sad :("
76561198101115250,Recommended,252890,18850027,"Posted: 2 November, 2015",all,greytrek19,"This game made an excellent overall impression. The format, while still familiar, is a welcome break from the cookie-cutter puzzle/HO products that populate the market. Not only are the HO scenes well crafted (they rely on clever or innocuous placement of objects rather than the common cop-outs of fading or obscuring them), but the progression sequences, while heavy on the collection of item sets for puzzles, also at least tend to make consistent sense, as opposed to all those games in which you might be asked to forgo your crowbar and find the tiny key to that shatterable glass cabinet. Indeed, the general flow of the story is far more linear and logical than the winding, obtuse, quasi-Wonderland adventures into which we are so often flung. The puzzles are mostly in the same vein of those you'd find anywhere, but a sprinkling of fresh ones (a version of the game Connect Four, for example) keeps them interesting. The most unique addition is the inclusion of vampiric powers - fueled, naturally, by imbibing blood - which act as keys to otherwise inaccessible items.The big problems here are the game's storytelling, attempts at roleplay, and sheer repetition. The interpretation of the supposed source material (the Bram Stoker novel) is downright laughable when it isn't simply cringeworthy. Dracula himself looks like he was scanned from the cover of a bad romance novel, and sounds - I kid you not - like Antonio Banderas; Van Helsing, an unassuming Dutchman in the book, is rendered as an imposing English noble with a fashion sense ironically more akin to what we traditionally associate with the titular vampire; and Igor is just a pathetic character with an even more pathetic voice who quickly becomes the Jar Jar of the game. The game also tries its hand at roleplaying, letting you choose either to ""turn"" or set loose each of the three or four minions of the villainess, promising that there will be ""consequences"" to your choice. In practice these consequences are reduced to a different outcome at game's end, which for most of us comes second fiddle to the actual puzzle/HO gameplay for which we're really signing up. The other motivation in these choices is supposed to be securing blood to charge Drac's special powers, but since the use of these powers is always necessary to proceed, the game is forced to give you the required number of (scarcely concealed) bottles of blood, simply plucked from the environment, which renders the only ""consequence"" the need to take three seconds to find these in each scene. Finally, the game's formula does get quite old after a time - collect tools and sets of puzzle pieces, complete puzzles, repeat until chapter is complete, repeat until game is complete - but, let's be honest, that's kind of just expected.Despite all this, the truth is that this game is actually a breath of fresh air. Longer than most, far more innovative than most, and sometimes more creative than most, it's the first of the genre in a long time to make me feel like I was playing an entirely new game. That means something in this market, don't you think?"

I enjoy these types of games as a welcome break from frenetic action games.  This one is particularly good this time of year (I played it 3 weeks before Halloween).  The story is fun and the voice acting is cheesy/good.  The painted artwork is lovely and the settings add a nice gothic atmosphere.  The  puzzles range from quite easy to very challenging, but you should never get stuck because there is a hint system available and an option to skip puzzles if needed, thereby eliminating frustrations and letting you move on with the story.  The game is a good value for the $10 pricetag.  It has a lot of replayability since you'll often want to retry areas to improve your time or chase achievements.  If you enjoy hidden item games, I would also suggest the Midnight Mysteries series.  Happy Gaming."
