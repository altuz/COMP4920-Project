The only ""feature"" they promised and delivered was the intuitive control. The navigation is pretty much the default for 3d software.Incomplete. Not a work in progress. Not an early access. It's simply a pre-alpha quality release being sold as a final product. Typos, bugs, endless crashes. Not Steam quality standard.You can hire extra engineers, but can't get them to do anything. The development was aborted before that. You have a tooltip they call a tutorial on description. But it explains what they planned to develop, not what they actually did. You can sell your skyscraper. And sometimes you'll be able to buy it back for the original land value... and sell again for the skyscraper value... and repeat... If for some reason the game sells you two vehicles with the same name, your save file is wasted. the game will crash when you try to sell or move the vehicle or when the building process is over.For ages 6 and below. Not challenging. One of the only simulator games where anyone that can read will probably get everything right since the first attempt. If you sell your buildings, you'll get rich. If you rent them out, you'll get rich. You can just set the price to maximum and ensure maximum profits. Nothing to calculate, no need for operations research. Any building will sell for maximum price within one year. And you can't build a new one faster than that anyway... no need to hurry then. If you set the rent out price to the maximum, you'll get the maximum sale value every 4 years. You'll start slower, but will build up steady income faster (exponential income growth). You can use your steady income to ensure you won't run out of money when investing more than you have.As a matter of fact, your only job is to allocate workforce and machinery. Too bad that's about half a thousandth of the skyscraper building costs. In other words, you can fail pathetically and will still look successful.For some reason, you can rent out your skyscraper as soon as it's about 20% done constructing (60% total building time). That means you only need money enough for 60% of the building process. From that point on, the rent will give you more than you can possibly spend on its construction.No maps or modding. No scripting to fix their bugs. Simulators really need modding capabilities. Especially if the developers decide not to finish the game before (or after) selling.Only worth buying if it has a 98% off discount. The only two challenges in the game are:1 - Play for one hour without quitting out of boredom or having the game crash.2 - Try to have fun playing this. Your role is irrelevant. There is no real challenge.3 - Go bankrupt without intentionally cutting all your revenue streams.TL;DR: the official game screenshots will bring you more challenge and fun than the actual game. They've worked harder on them than the development."

You control how many people, dozers, cranes, etc are working on your tower. Gameplay is oddly linear: you can't do anything until you've finished ""excavating"", then you have to build a foundation, which is the most boring part, and then construction starts. That last phase is the most exciting -- you get to play duelling cranes by allocating your cranes between the concrete team and the steel team.Not much to it.

STAY THE F*_*CK AWAY FROM IT!!!This was one of the first games I bought on Steam and, boy, what a way to start.The first thing that struck me was the bland and undetailed graphics that just made my eyes share some tears for how bad they looked. I'm not the kind of guy that judges a game by it's graphics. But, damn! The graphics of this game sucks right across the board! The world overview is just a Google Maps image used as a texture and slapt over a overly simplified 3D ""model"" of a ""city"". Do I need to go further on how the graphics on this game sucks? In case I do, lemme tell you that you have only TWO models of skyscrapers to choose from and, as you might expect, they look like HORRIBLE. And when I say HORRIBLE, I REALLY mean it.The gameplay is so bland, so poor, so repetitive and counfusing that I actually felt sad experiencing it. You will spend maybe five to ten minutes micromanaging stuff to get your skyscraper done and that's it. Your skyscraper will be finished and you'll not feel a single dent of accomplishment for it. You will, in fact, feel sad for having wasted your life with such a poor and boring excuse of a game. Wasn't it enough, there is a bug in the game that will start playing thousands of samples at the same time making a hell of a noise, just like a freaking stun grenade, and, if this bug don't blow your eardrums instantly, will definitelly leave your ears ringing for a while. Sound fun, eh?!This game is an offence to anyone who bought it. And the best part is that the developers just don't give a flying f:3ck about it being bad; they just don't bother paying attention to the feedback given by the costumers to improve it. Well, if the developers made this ""tvrd"" (that's latin for sh*t) of a game only to make some quick buck and not improve it any further, I say ♥♥♥♥ the developers and ♥♥♥♥ this game.Have my 0, ZERO, ZED, NONE, NULL out of 10."

,Not Recommended,252910,8579525,"Posted: 5 January, 2014",all,No Dread,"So, I bought this game expecting it to be kindof underwhelming, even as someone who likes management games. Unfortunately, it didn't even match my lowered expectations.Initially, I thought I could have input into the skyscraper's design; fiddle with floorplans and construction methods and so forth. What I got was 3 arbitrary choices for sky scraper design and 4 slider bars to tweak quality/quantity/type of rooms in the building, and the number of floors. That's it.At this point I thought 'oh well, maybe they make up for this with complex and engaging mechanics in management of the actual construction. I could dig that.' What I expected now was a game with plenty of 'make sure this resource is managed well' and 'hire/fire staff as needed', but also a game with slightly complex decisions like choosing companies to contract with, or buying resource sources. Also random events, and a solid progression as described of 'start with multistory houses, and work up to mega skyscrapers'. What I got was a game of 'hire/fire people as needed. that's it.'By the time I finished the tutorial/learning process (completed one skyscraper), I decided I'd build another. I maxed the speed the whole time, and found myself entirely and utterly bored. This isn't really a game so much as an add-on for some other, non-existant game with the other 90% of the process. I am generally not critical of games, but this game is only worth a dollar or two as it stands. These simulator games seem to be turning out to be a money grab, rather than a genuine simulator.

When I saw this game, thought it could be a good micromanagement simulator, but it started to drive me crazy even before the gameplay because I couldn't launch it (actually I spent more time trying to make it work than playing the game). There's no strategy in it, it's a one way road where there's a right path, and everything different will result in game over. And when the ""road"" is just twiddle sliders, most people will get bored within less than 10 minutes. I don't blame who greenlighted it (because I think I would too), but it's the first game which made me want my money back."

The screen remains blank. The Steam overlay freezes in place, and the game stops responding.The issue lies not in my hardware. My i7-4790k, gt740, and 16GB of ram well exceed the minimum specifications. The issue lies purely in this peice of software(search online, many people suffer the same affliction).As far as I can find, there is no fix. The game is broken and in an unplayable state. I would strongly recommend not purchasing ""Skyscraper Simulator"", save your $10USD for something else.TL;DRPros: -A dang fine black screen before it crashes.Cons: -Lacks any kind of depth/gameplay in its current state, because it does not work.Other Thoughts: I am used to Early Access games being flawed, however this is beyond that.

Buying temporary kiddie tattoos from the vending machines at the front of KMart is less of a waste of your money.  There is no point to the game.  Some of the mechanics that you're promised just are not there.  I wish that I'd read other reviews before I bought it.  At least I got it for a couple bucks, so I didn't lose that much."

The gameplay is extremely limited and there's pretty much nothing fun about it. Hire some workers, set max speed, and wait for the construction to complete."
