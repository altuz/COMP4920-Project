By 100-150 hours, you'll be flying around the map to score some crazy looking goals (in your opinion). But then, that's when the fun actually begins: mastering the basic moves of the game is basically mastering 1% of what you can do in this game. You'll end up playing more and more and more, until you realize you've just spent three hours in practice hitting the same shot again and again. Yes, this game is higly addictive.

To do those insane aerial maneuvers, you'll need quite some training.The Main Motivation comes from being a competitive game, either via ranked games or normal matches against other players. There is also a single-player mode, but that's more for practicing and getting into the game than a selling point for the game.You can also unlock stuff for your car, like hats, booster color, tires and patterns to put onto your car.I've never been a big fan of either genre, yet Rocket League manages to pull me in and gets me excited about every match i play. Even if you're playing with random people, it's not that bad and you can have quite some fun, though having a good team which is working good together would be the most fun.So, hope to see some of you on the field :)"

,Recommended,252950,23012151,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,Rocket (NOT A FURRY),"Rocket League is one of my favorite games.  Why?The game's system is the best that i can imagine. Your advantage over other players isn't measured by how many hours you have, how many dlcs you got, or your level. It's measured by how much you've learned and perfected.You start as a derp car that can't hit a ball 20ft above the ground. Then you keep playing against people of the same skill, until you see someone who can do some cool/pro/funky/op stuff, then you see his goals and you think: ""Wow, look at that shot, i must learn how to do it!""Then in a matter of time, you learn how to do it and even do better. One step closer to become a Rocketeer.some more training and you can hit the ball wherever it is.even more and you can aim the ball wherever you want.The controls are great, comfortable and very easy to learn. If you use a controller, you will not have an advantage against who uses a keyboard and vice-versa.The graphics are nice, you can play it with a microwave using low graphics, or a medium computer on max graphics with a solid 60 fps. They could be better though (?)The levels normally represent your skill very well if you aren't a lot above-average or below-average, with a Rookie playing like a rookie and a legend playing like a legend. (The level ""Pro"" is just wrong, you probably aren't pro yet if you are there)The matchmaker does its job well. Rather than your level, it takes your ""skill"" in consideration, so you will often play with people only slightly better or worse than you. This isn't bad, it is actually very good for you to learn and get better.Can i say anything more?NO item in the game gives you advantage over other player, all cars have the same speed and the only thing that changes is the hitbox, not a big deal when you learn the controls. The DLCs don't make you better or anything, too."

They worked day an night and now everything is working fine at least for me.So, i played this game on Beta on PS4 and i was pretty hyped about the launch. It didn't disapoint. I have it for free on PS4 and bought it on steam to play with friends.The game is a ton of fun. The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master.Graphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options (FOR FREE).We can face AI opponents with diferente skill levels (that can make a huge diference) or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill (sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours).There are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not.Its great to play with friends. Hard to quit playing even if you're really tired.I seriously recomend using a controller. I use my DS4 with Bluetooth (using inputmapper) and it works perfectly. For ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce (helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller).A word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems. Keep up the  good work.Great game. One of the better for sure to release this year."

,Recommended,252950,17801404,"Posted: 30 August, 2015",all,Butt Man,"Rocket League ReviewGame DetailsGame:Rocket LeagueGenre:SportsDeveloped by:PsyonixPublished by:PsyonixRelease Date:7 July, 2015Metacritic Score:86 (Link)Game Review""Lets play some Carball!""Rocket Leagueis a game which combines soccer and reckless driving. It is a sequel to the game SARPBC, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars and it is produced by Psyonix. It includes cross-platform play between PS4 and PC, having an huge playerbase currently.GameplayYou will have lots of fun with this game guaranteed! The controls are ultra-simple to use, you will get used to them in a blink of an eye. I play the game with a controller, which for me it is the best way to play it, but it is enjoyable to play with the keyboard + mouse too. The game itself is ultra fun! The ball physics with the rebounds and all feel impressively well, as the cars handling. It is incredibly easy to play, yet extremely difficult to master. You also have to use strategy in this game in order to win the matches, much like regular soccer. If you are just a ball chaser you will have difficult times winning, you have to think about your positioning and timing very well. You can also do incredible trick shots and jump shots due to your boost, which are incredible hard to master, but after some time you will start to get the hang of it. The worst part are some camera angles and the bots AI, but unless you plan on only playing offline games, the AI wont be much of a problem. It feels so good to make some incredible plays, even when you fail you will have tons of laughs. It is a very simple game with simple ideas, yet they work perfectly and make this game a blast to play for both casual and professional players.LongevityThe longevity of a game which relies on an multiplayer-focused game can be debatable, but in this one I am sure you will spend enough hours to compensate the money you spend in the game. At the moment I have spent 35 hours and intend to spend many more. You have tons of cars, paint jobs, hats and other customization stuff to unlock during the game that will keep you entertained for the first hours (I unlocked everything in around 20 hours). You also have 4 different game-modes (1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4) which give some good diversity since each one of the modes has its own strategies to follow in order to win them. You also have an offline season mode available to play, but it is kind of boring in my opinion given the multiplayer options you have. Practice mode is also available, a great place to tune your skills up. The ranks and leaderboards system will also entertain you, it is great to climb up against your friends in the diverse list of leaderboards available.Graphics and PresentationOnly have good things to say here too. By the moment you enter the game you will know you are in for something special. Slick menus with an ultra easy interface plus amazing songs will make you excited right at the first time you open the game. You got plenty of voice commands to use in-game which is definitely a plus presentation wise. Now the graphics. Another win in this spectacular game. Great graphics for a game this simple. All works really well, the colors, grass, car details, everything looks great. The level of detail in the cars and their customization objects is great too. These are some impressive visuals, even though the main focus of the game is definitely not the graphics.Music and SoundsThe soundtrack in this game is amazing. I was totally not expecting it, there are really some great songs in it, got some of them stuck in my head. There are only around eleven songs in it, but most are awesome and don't get old. The various sounds in the game are also great, from the sounds of the different boost types, ball hits, drifts, crashes, everything works really well.MultiplayerThis is the big deal in this game. And oh boy, how fun it is to play it with or against friends. You will have tons of fun making the best goals ever as well as the biggest fails in history. It really gives you tons of laughs. You have also the option to play ranked instead of casual games, which make for some more intense, fun matches! The playerbase is huge, around 100000 players are online in most of the time, so you will find games in a matter of seconds. The community is in it´s majority very friendly, but like in all multiplayer games, you will find some toxic people playing the game too. You also have different server regions to choose from so you can play without worrying about lag. Unfortunately I did have some crazy lags in some european servers. It is rare to find a laggy server but it happens and can get very frustrating, specially when you are playing ranked. Yet, I am sure the devs will fix most of the server issues soon, so no worries about that.SummaryPros:Newcomer-friendly gameplay, yet difficult to masterGreat controlsAmazing soundtrackGreat graphics and presentationAmazing multiplayer with lots of fast-paced, intense matchesCons:The Bots AI is pretty weakSome connection issues in multiplayerMy personal score:9.0/10If you enjoy high octane reckless driving and the world's most popular sport, Rocket League is for you. It is one of the most fun multiplayer games released in the last years. The base price is great value for the game you get, which will get you hours and hours of great fun! Embrace the latest gaming trend in Steam and PS4 and have a blast playing this soccer-meets-cars gem!"

This is a game about cars playing football (or soccer depending on where you live) and it is simply just amazing. The gameplay is great, it's easy to play but hard to master. If you have friends to play with you'll have an even better time with it than going solo, but going at it alone can be quite enjoyable too. There are no server issues and all DLC is purely cosmetic with there being no direct advantages to using a certain car over another (although each car has different hitboxes).The main mode will have you playing 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and chaotically fun 4v4 matches and the game gets updated often with free game modes such as Hoops and Dropshot. You can tell the love the developers have for this game with everything they do and how they listen to the community and the game greatly improves thanks to it.This game, although it looks simple, it is honestly extremely well-made and perfected making it a game that will have you coming back to it.

Literally years. We've put thousands of hours into it. It's one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because it's always fun.Rocket League, I'm happy to say, is SARPBC with improved graphics and gameplay, better accessibility for new players, plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character. It's going to comfortably replace SARPBC in my top five games, all-time, across all genres. It's also replacing SARPBC as my absolute favorite multiplayer game - online or local.Positive+ Fun, deep, brilliantly fast-paced gameplay+ Games are long enough to mean something, but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating.+ Games are almost never over until the final buzzer. Results can turn on a dime - and when they do, it's always because a player or team has stepped up, rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself.+ The learning curve is fairly smooth, but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high. Despite the aforementioned years playing SARPBC, I still see players in Rocket League pulling off moves that I can only dream of.+ There's massive flexibility in how you play, more than any other game I know of. Offline with bots. Offline split-screen. Online. Online split-screen. Online split-screen with bots. 1 v 1 if you don't feel like playing on a team, or 2 v 2 / 3 v 3 / 4 v 4 if you do. And the game is just as suited to mano-a-mano matches as it is to team play, which is (again) a very, very rare quality.Negative- The one slightly disappointing thing I'll mention is (at launch) the lack of variety in maps. SARPBC had a bunch of quite inventive, distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics. Rocket League's maps are aesthetically different, but structurally uniform. Luckily, word is that some 'crazier' maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free DLC.  I'm still thoroughly enjoying what's already there, but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome.ConclusionIf the idea of fast-paced soccer (sans rules) with cars even vaguely appeals to you, get this game immediately. It's one I fully expect to still be playing - and thoroughly enjoying - years from now."

76561198047672025,Recommended,252950,34836088,Posted: 9 September,all,Conker,"This is my go-to game on steam and also the one i've put the most hours into so i wanted to finally review it. I honestly don't ever see a time where i'll stop playing this, the gameplay never gets old. The physics are spot on for the ball and car handling. If you play Ranked then you will only ever choose 1 of 4 cars to play with that have the best physics, turning radius, hitbox etc.I will say that it's one of these games that you will either get into or you won't, there's no middle ground really. Actually originally i was gonna hold off on getting this but then i technically got it free when i bought a Steam Controller which came bundled with Rocket League and Portal 2, i woulda got it sooner if i knew how fun and addictive it was...or maybe i wouldn't have so i could spend more time playing all the steam games i neglect cos of this one lol.There are 4 standard game modes being 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and chaos which is 4v4, 3v3 usually being the most played and also most balanced. 1v1 and 2v2 are the most tense, if you make a mistake in those modes you will pay for it. The 3v3 mode allows more leeway for mistakes. The chaos 4v4 mode is the most goofy fun one, but only new players tend to play that one, so it's hard to find a game of chaos with skilled opponents which is a shame.There are also special game modes which include an ice hockey one where the ball is now a puck that slides around the pitch. Hoops which is a 2v2 basketball mode (i'm not good at that mode). Rumble mode where you all get powerups which enable you to swap places with the enemy or mess with their driving physics, that mode is the most luck based, it's fun to play for 5 minutes but i honestly haven't played it since it released. I think Dropshot is the most recent mode where you have to score by breaking the ground away on the opponents side and drop the ball through the hole you created. That mode is pretty interesting and probably my fave along with the ice hockey one.Negatives would be that Psyonix are becoming increasingly greedy in how they priced the DLC cars. When they first introduced the DLC cars you got 2 for like £2.50 i think, and then it was about £1.60 to buy each car separately. And finally now to get new cars you have to f*ck with their crate and key system. No longer can you just....you know buy a f*cking car you might want! you need to buy a key or set of keys to open a crate which among other useless cosmetic items MIGHT contain the car you want.I'm not spending £20 on keys to unlock 2 cars, or spending hours trying to trade crates or a number of cosmetics with people, i don't play this game to trade, If anyone that works at Psyonix reads this can you please give us the option of buying the cars outright again, i don't think it's too much to ask in all honesty. Rule number one of game development should be don't force your playerbase to use a system they hate, especially when you used to be able to buy the cars from the store.I think a lot of more casual players may not even realise that there are new cars you can only get through the crate system. I know some fanboys may defend these practices because some of the money goes to the Rocket League esports division. My question is why am i being asked to pay for someone elses prize pool? Why don't Psyonix pay the winners through sponsorships or something like wtf really, makes no sense to me.The other negative and it's a big one, the one that will turn you off the game is the playerbase, this community is the worst i've experienced, i don't play CS:GO so i'm sure that's worse but dude, you will play against or with the most childish, racist, immature and fickle gamers you can imagine. One minute your own teammate will praise you for scoring or saving a goal and the next they will spam ""what a save"" over and over when they hit the ball passed your own goal and you fail to save it in time, i had this happen to me yesterday.There are players who will start playing against your team if you hit them by accident or don't let them have the ball for 90% of the game, hell sometimes they just start playing against you for no reason at all. I will say i think the verbal abuse through the chat window has gotten better, you can disable the chat and also report people, i think Psyonix may actually temp ban people now for that kinda stuff, i've seen people on the forums complaining about being banned for that.If it were up to me i would get rid of all of the chat and emote spamming from the game altogether. This is the other thing about it, people use the emote spam to save face when they miss the ball to pin a mistake on you, telling you to ""take the shot"" or spamming ""centering"" or ""in position"" when they just handed the ball to the other team, then when the other team scores cos of their mistake they will spam ""What a save"" at their teammates.I'm not saying i'm amazing at this game, i can admit that i'm average, i'll go for weeks without playing this sometimes and then suck when i come back to it. I'm only Gold II in ranked right now. I think that gives me a good broad perspective on the playerbase though. A tip would be to disable chat and also don't play ranked when you are new cos that's just messed up, learn to play and then join ranked mode.To be more positive you do get nice players from time to time, but they are few and far between and also to be honest it actually comes across as creepy to me when they are nice to you in the chat, it's so jarring to what i'm used to lol.The matchmaking system also needs to be reconfigured, some games will have you matched with a whole team who may be 2 or 3 levels higher than yours or vice versa. This happens more often than you would think.The game offers a lot of content and different game modes though, Psyonix also continually adds new free stadiums and game modes through updates so the game feels fresh and continues to evolve over time."

If you are subscribed to any of gaming Youtube channels or websites, you are probably already familiar with the game and you know that there is quite a lot of hype about it. And that hype is not unjustified.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You are in control of a car and your mission is to score enough goals to win the match with other players. You can play multiplayer (with actual people) or singleplayer (with bots). Also, there is a freeplay mode for you to sharpen your skills.Pros:The way this game looks is astonishing. Grass, cars, turbo effects, the ball, the arena ... they really look good. I mean, look at the Store page screenshots!Multiple game modes for both online and offline playing (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4). Ranked cannot be 4v4, however. If you play on ""Unfair"" difficulty against bots, you can also play 1v2, 1v3 and 1v4.There is a tutorial in this game and unlike some other games, you can actually learn stuff from this one. For basic playing, there is a short tutorial just explaining how to move and jump, but if you have time and will to take your playing technique to the next level, this is taken care of by more advanced tutorials. This is probably one of rare games where you actually want to play tutorial multiple times.Car handling is near-perfect, it really goes where you want it to go. Also, you can drive one the walls, fly and even drive upside down on the arena ceiling for a short time.A very special thing in this game is so-called ""Ball View"", where camera is always pointing towards the camera. You can turn it on and off at appropriate times to maximize your efficiency while trying to hit the ball into opponents' net.Car customization content is absurd. You get hundreds of wheels, antennas, hats, car types ... you are guaranteed to find a combination that suits you.Next thing about car customization is how you unlock parts. This is the best way I've seen it handled: you get something for every single match you play. Yes, you've heard right. No matter what you play, with bots with real people, 1v1, you always get something.After playing every match, you also get a chance to save a replay of the game you have just played. These saved games can be then watched from perspectives of all players, there is also a free camera mode.Matchmaking seems to be working well, I've never been in a match that would be completely unfair or unbalanced.The soundtrack is amazing, it consists of 11 songs that are also available onAmazonandiTunes.You get XP even for playing with bots, but you get only 50% of you would get with playing online. Still, it's a great way to encourage people to play more. You also get some XP for losing.This thing runs great even on old computers and you don't even have to have all the setting set to low!The community is really active, there are almost five thousand threads created on Steam Discussions, there are tons of Youtube videos and streamers playing it.Cons:Only occasional lags when playing online. Also, sometimes servers are dead for a minute, but that only happened twice to me. Not a problem at all.There is PS4 support, but no Linux and MacOS? Come on!The final verdict:With practically no bad sides and tons of good stuff in this game, I certainly recommend it to everyone, not just fans of soccer or racing. I'm not a big fan of either of them, but I enjoy this game a great deal. You can customize your car in more than 10 billion combinations, the game really encourages you to play and the feeling when you play is amazing.This is certainly one of the best games released this year. There are so many people playing all the time, there are streams, Youtube videos, tons of discussions, simply amazing. You can't be sure how long is this going to last for, so try grabbing it as soon as it gets any discount or even now, as it is certainly worth the full 20$ price tag.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

There is more:Even though on the first look this game's concept appears simple and goofy, the depth of gameplay found here is insanely high. Rocket League is one of those games which allow you to do amazing plays and moves if you dedicated time and effort into it, but at the same time provide a lot of fun while played casually with friends.What to expectThis game is the sequel to the PS3 game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars from 2008. Therefore the game idea isn't new and the gameplay doesn't differ a lot. But since the same developer Psyonix stay behind Rocket League, their experience allowed them to address problems and improve the game (as well as shorten the name :P).Rocket League provides fast 5 minute rounds inside a box-shaped arena. The edges of the arena are curved to allow players to drive up walls and even on the ceiling. The team size can range from one to four players on each team.The gameplay is fast and because of the playingfield's small size goals can be scored from the other side of it, since there are no obstacles in the way other than a potentional defending player. Blocking the ball and doing a counterattack right afterwards happens within seconds and can turn an entire game.The carsThere are multiple car models to choose from, but their handling or top speed does not differ. Only the hitbox of the cars are slighly different - which creates some tiny variation in the ball interaction. However the main purpose of having multiple cars is to customize it without interfering or imbalancing the gameplay. This works very well and choosing a car is a personal preference rather than a statistical battle to determine which car is the best. The car customization comes with color, surface type, additional decal, wheels, antenna, goofy hats and particles for the rocket trail.""Rocket trail?"" you may ask. Well, in Rocket League every car has a Rocket Engine attached to its back allowing to boost itself to greater speed. The best part is that you can jump and shoot yourself into the air with it and being able to fly. This creates gameplay in all three dimensions. Instead of just dribbling the ball on the ground, you can launch yourself into the air and hit the ball before your enemy can. It is not easy and adds a decent learning-curve to the game.The experienceThe game is very polished. The options menu allows key rebinding serparatly for keyboard and controller, very in-depth adjustments to the camera position/behaviour as well as a large choice of grafic options for the Unreal Engine 3.Textures are very detailed, particle effects very well made. The grass on the ground is fantastically animated. Even though the arena/stadiums are the same, there are four different theme versions, ranging from a raining indoor park to a full blown stadium with thousand of people cheering.The cars handle very well, can turn fast and stick to the ground unless you want and tell them to drift. Once airborne keeping the control of the car or wanting to do what you want is difficult but not impossible. The physic engine of the game does it's work very well. The ball itself is predictable and doesn't behave random at all.You unlock new parts for your car customization after completing each game - no matter the outcome of the match. The account progress is ok, but nothing incredible or important. This game shines when it comes to it's gameplay.The sound effects as well as grafical effects while playing or just driving around are incredible enjoyable. Boosting to full speed makes you feel powerful, ramming people and even destroying them creates satisfing explosions. And when scoring a goal the ball explodes and creates a shockwave on which you can ride on with your rocket launcher. Directly afterwards you get a replay of the goal in slow motion. At the end of the game you can save a replay of the entire game and watch it whenever you want.Setting up goals and blocking the ball also feel rewarding by the system and on a team-spirit basis.Since the game has high skill ceiling, experienced players can crush any other ones. The matchmaking system works very well in that regard, that you get matched up with equally good players and even indicates if it doesnt find them and slowly extends it's skill range in order to find players as fast as possible. You can group up to play together in normal and ranked games.You also have the choice of selecting multiple regional servers such as Europe, Oceanic, West- and East-America, as well as queueing up for multiple modes (e.g. 1vs1 and 3v3) at the same time. The game will put you in the first fitting game it can find for you.The game also provides a singleplayer campaign against the AI, as well as tutorials and training for various parts of the game such as defending the goal and scoring goals. For those who just want to get used to the controls or test can hop into the sandbox mode.I also like to mention that you can queue up for an online game from any menu or singleplayer gamemode. So while searching you can play around in sandbox mode.Downloadable Content (Supersonic Fury DLC Update)As announced by Psyonix, the first major update hit Rocket League. I first was disappointed that they want to go the DLC route. Not because i dont like to pay for content, but more because of the bad reputation the word 'DLC' has nowadays, fearing that Rocket League gets looked down for doing this markt strategie. But my fear should vanish.The first DLC just includes two new car and customization items for a small price. The real update includes free stuff for everyone. New map, new specator mode, better ranked play, improved main menu background, and so on. With the new update the 20€ i pay for the game are even more worth it. And Psyonix plans are to keep going, maybe even into the direction of modding and crazy maps.So yes. I am excited for every upcomming Update and DLC.ConclusionI recommend this game to everyone. May it be casual players, those who play in a group to have fun together as well as the ones who like play competitively. Playing this game has the perfect fun/frustration balance and great learning curve."

How I could miss such a diamond I do not know. Usually I am not that much into racing games, which isn't really too much of a problem since I wouldn't exactly call it a typical racing game. Still it uses familiar driving mechanics and combines it with the most basic soccer rules. 2 teams of rocket-boosted-cars try to catapult, push, nitro-boost or bump an oversized football into the other teams goal.On the ""battlefield"" you find small nodes which add a little to your boost-meter, which is quite limited and you have to carefully time the use of you nitro-boost - if it's time to defend and you find yourself in the other team's half you are not going to get there on time. If the ball is on the way to your opponent's goal you will want to have as much boost as possible to ""kick"" the ball as hard as you can and also to outrace the other players.You can jump and even double-jump with your car, you can flip and turn in any direction whilst in the air in order to maximize your blocking possibilites and to kick the ball with a spinning move of your car's rear. It's hard to describe but play it for 1 hour and you will get what I mean. :)Rocket League is crazy, it involves a lot of skill but does not have a particularly steep learning curve. There are only so many moves you can make and the real challenge is to master them all. Matchmaking works like a charm, new games are found quickly and you can decide wether you want to play ranked or just for the fun of it.I imagine if you play 3v3 together with 2 friends on your team this game gets even greater.The only things I would wish for in future updates are a little more map variation and some different game modes.Since there is pretty much only one stadium with several different textures and lighting, things could get a tad repetitive after a while. I can really see the potential of ramps being in there, maybe some minor upgrades/boosts ready for pickup and so on... You could go really crazy expanding the existing formula.Other than that - I can recommend this without any shadow of a doubt!"

If you're someone like me, who doesn't like cars or football, you may be put off by this at first, but it's definitely not what it seems, it's no wonder it's so popular. Definitely worth it!Now for the full reviewRocket League is a game where you drive around in a rocket powered car trying to score goals. Sounds boring doesn't it? It really isn't. Rocket League suprised me. It's not one of those generic sports games I was anticipating it to be. It's a really addicting and competitive game. The game is highly physics based, meaning you'll see cars jumping and flying around. Realistic!Your team can have up to at least 4 players, with matches lasting five minutes. The goal is basically what you do in football/soccer, score goals. The team with the most goals wins. This can be a challenge sometimes as it does require team-work, unless it's 1 v 1. There definitely isn't a shortage of players, with thousands of players on Steam AND it's cross platform capability with players from the PS4, which isn't really seen that much in games. Finding a game shouldn't be too difficult either, the matchmaking system's perfect.The game highly advises you to use a controller, except when I started playing, my controller stopped working, so I resorted to using the keyboard. Honestly, it wasn't that hard for me to adapt. It does take time, for some people, but after that the controls become pretty simple, though I would still recommend using a controller, as there are plenty of people who struggle with the keyboard and mouse.The game isn't just multiplayer, there is a single player and a co-op mode. In single player, you are able to access a mode called Season. This puts you with your own unique team, and places you in a tournament against bots. I haven't really played much of it but it seemed pretty simple. If you want the most out of your money I would stick to the multiplayer as it's much more entertaining and challenging.There are quite a few different maps in Rocket League. Each one looks amazing and colourful, with quite a bit of background detail which isn't a suprise due to it being made on Unreal Engine 3. Despite all the activity going on in the match, performance was never an issue. This game runs rather smooth for what it is.There are different types of cars, all of which are fully customizable, ranging from colours to patterns to wheels etc. You can unlock these different customizations from completing matches. Not to mention, there's plenty of dlc that add different cars and customization items, that have quite reasonable price tags.Rocket League is one of those games where you can loose track of time playing it, and I'm glad I replayed it after months of it sitting around in my library. It's highly addicting and I can see why it's so popular. It also has such an amazing soundtrack that plays in the background of the main menu, with some really memorable songs. If you have spare money, I'd definitely say this is worth it, a near flawless game. The DLC seems quite reasonable as well.Pros- Highly addicting- Amazing detail- Highly customizable- Great performance- Amazing soundtrackCons- Problems with keyboard controlshttp://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC82dWrFqCEIf you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

,Recommended,252950,17458172,"Posted: 9 August, 2015",all,Tom,"Rocket League is a physics based football type game(no I will not call it soccer). It is actually a sequel to a game called Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.  Rocket League was released in early July 2015 on the PC and PlayStation 4.The gameplay is very simple, you control a rocket powered car and you use it to play a game of football. To many this may sound boring and unfun if you aren't a fan of either cars, or football - let me reassure you though, even if you aren't a fan, I guarantee you will have fun whilst playing Rocket League. The game is highly addictive and it will keep you playing until the early hours of the morning with that ""Just one more match"" feel to it.Rocket League has a single player mode, an online multiplayer mode and a local multiplayer mode. I haven't played the single player as the multiplayer is completely where the action is at. The match making system works flawlessly, you will not have any problems finding a game, as of right now there are over 20,000 people playing. Each match lasts 5 minutes, and can consist of teams of 1, 2, 3 or 4 people. Personally I enjoyed the more hectic type matches of 3 or 4. Another nice little bonus is that Rocket League also works cross-platform, meaning you could end up being in a match with PS4 players which is one of the first I've seen run this type of system.The controls are very simple, and you can pick them up in a matter of seconds.It is highly recommended that you play this game with a controller though, I have not heard any success stories of people using keyboard and mouse to play.Graphically, Rocket League is an awesome game to look at, just the right amount of lens flare, smooth animations and gorgeous looking backgrounds and arenas to play in. The game is ran using Unreal Engine 3, and it has been pushed to look stunning.I wouldn't exactly say Rocket League to be a difficult game, it has a very pick up and play vibe to it, but it will take you a couple of hours to become a real asset to your team mates, rather than just driving back and forth on the map chasing the ball.I have been playing Rocket League for almost six hours now, I am by no means a master at this game, and it feels as if I am only scratching the surface of the skill level you can reach. Like I said, this game is highly addictive, you will really struggle to put it down after you boot it up. The fast paced action and quick matches keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.This game runs as smooth as a babies bottom, the 60 fps, high resolutions and customize-able graphics make this a really PC game that is highly worth your time.' We are looking at one of the games of the year right here.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playhttps://youtu.be/5oRwCiNd994If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The community is so much better than other games, not as toxic, more friendly, more fun, The developers listen to the community and constantly try to improve the game to make it more exciting. It's not pay to win, so anyone can do just as well without spending any extra money.It is also optional to play with either keyboard + mouse (like myself for 1,450 hours) or use a controller. While a controller allows for more specific angles, the game is still as fun without it. You can still get a professional level on keyboard + mouse, it is just preference, however for people starting out I would suggest using a controller if it's available as it CAN allow for some better shots.Overall a  fantastic game, definitely one I'm not giving up on anytime soon."

,Recommended,252950,23716445,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,Jadarma,"OverviewRocket League is a very popular, iconic multi-platform game that doesn't do much, but it gets by formidably with the few it has. Speaking as someone not interested in either cars nor football(Yes, football. The real one!), this game is incredibly addictive, and worthwhile if you have a few friends to play with.The Pros:Incredibly Fun- Simple concept, easy to get the hang of but with a very high skill ceiling to keep you motivated in playing for a long time. Scoring some trick shot goals or plain luck bounces of the wall both fill the adrenaline in your soul. Winning is rewarding, and losing just makes you want a rematch.Great Visuals- The level of detail is pretty decent, and cranking up the settings at maximum really gives it a nice feel in terms of visuals. The car models are very detailed, weather effects are decent, and praise the Gods for the adjustable FoV!Customization- Playing unlocks car parts to customize your ride with. You can unlock several car bodies, paint types, wheels, hats (yes, TF2 style), exhaust particles and antennas. There are loads of possibilities and you can feel the car is truly yours. The only gripe I have with this is that you cannot save multiple ""load-outs"" and you cannot have a different setup based on team color. (Some accessories look godly on Red but awful on Blue and vice versa.)Game Customization- You can host private matches with all sorts of modifiers, from gravity, to ball size, to boost speed, time and goal limits, anything! Go crazy and experiment!Good Influx of Content- About once a month or two, new content is added. A new map here, a few more antennas there, a new game mode sprinkled once every season.The Cons:Unfair Input Method Balance- Unfortunately for us PC Purists out there, this game was designed for controllers. Specifically, the boost flying. Doing it on a keyboard is next to impractical, it is very unintuitive and hard to master. You can still play very well with a keyboard, but face against a team of controller users and you will be in for a bad time. The simplest fix that I CANNOT BELIEVE they didn't implement: The option to sort matchmaking for different input methods.Horrendous Matchmaking- The system is mainly broken. If you play ranked, you will occasionally find yourself in a match with people 30 levels above you, because they play with a newbie friend that is unranked. It seems the game gives the team rating by calculating the average ranks of the members, and ignores Player level completely. So if players who are Veterans + but did not play ranked will be matched with anyone with their same rank.Community is a bit Toxic- Not being PC or defensive, just a tad warning that you will get the (albeit maturer than) CoD attitude of ""lol newb get rekt"" from time to time.Paid DLC-specific Achievements- There are new car DLCs to buy and fortunately they are purely cosmetic... but they decided to add achievements to them, so achievement hunters beware! You can't perfect this game without taking out your wallet because they decided it's a real challenge to ""Win an Online Match with this new Car!"".ConclusionDespite the shortcomings, this game is incredibly fun. But do not purchase alone! Convince three friends to get it too and buy the 4-pack. Aside from better price, you will get a vastly superior experience when playing with people you know.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work,consider joining my groupandfollow my curatorpage!

But there is something which they cant fix and can make your experience one of the worst that you will ever have.What i am referring its to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community on this game,i swear i've never seen such a toxic community on my entire life,and i've played games like CS:GO,CoD and others. If you decide to play this game with people that you've never seen on your life,then im almost sure that in 5 matches that you play at least on 4 you will be trash talked by a 13yo kid who plays this game the entire day and likes to blame YOU for some mistakes.To be honest you cant enjoy this game for 15 minutes without being trash talked,you may think that ignoring might be the best fix for this,but after hearding words like ''Niger , Kys , You suck , EZ , WHAT A SAVE!'' for like 300 times you may think that ignoring isnt one option. I'm wondering why they don't ban people who behave this way to make the game better and enjoable,i really have to admit that sometimes i almost unistalled the game just because of those kids.Although i really recommend this game,but here goes some few tips,Disable the chat before matches,specially on competitive ones,just allow the chat for your teammate also be patient and try to dont get mad (even though i really think you wont resist for long after being trash talked by a 10yo kid) and the last tip,try to play this game with a friend,its going to be way better. I wish you luck out there,you will need it if you are going to play it solo."

On my medium spec system it runs at 80-100fps on max settings.Longevity: As mentioned before, this game challenges you to learn new things and experiment to grow in skill. I always feel like I am getting better, and not just stagnating in skill.DLC: Best cars in the game are free! DLC just for cosmetic purposes!There are of course, other good elements to this game, those however are the main points in my opinion. I'd rather alert you to the potential difficulties in the remainder of this review.The bad.Matchmaking: The matchmaking does a decent job of pairing you with good opponents. BUT! If two players of unequal skill levels are playing together in a party, it will find a match to the skill level of the better player. This makes it unpleasent for the lower tier player. Ping is NOT at all accounted into the matchmaking. I live in an area far from the server locations, I am used to getting 200+ ping. Anything under 250 ping is playable. Sometimes however I can enter a ranked match with ping in excess of 600, this is not playable, and is basically a garunteed derank. This won't be a problem for most people, but for those of us living in the dark parts of the world, beware! Not the smoothest experience.Community: While not nearly as bad as the CSGO community, it has it's fair share of trollers and salty kids. This should be a given with a large multiplayer game, but it's liable to get worse as the game grows, so take note!VerdictIs Rocket League a good game? ... Yes.Is it fun? ... Yes, especially with friends.Is it worth the price? ... Yes, definitely, but if you struggle financially, wait for a sale, as is the case with all games.Should YOU buy it? ... If you like the idea and want to try it out, yes. If you don't like racing or soccer, you may still love it (as is the case with myself), if you want a serious racing or soccer game though, look elsewhere.HIGHLY RECCOMENDED"

I’ve been playing it for almost 200 hours and I still have a lot to learn. Overall, it’s easy to play, but hard to be good at. If you want to know more about that, I suggest watching some montages of the gameplay.At the time this review was written, there are nine casual game modes (but that number will probably grow), including hockey, basketball, and more standard modes. All the different modes are truly awesome. The game mode with the most players is 4v4, the least is 1v1. Ranked currently has four modes: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and solo 3v3 (where each player solo queues).There’s also many different arenas, and more will probably be added.When I play competitively, I realize that there’s a lot of strategy in terms of positioning, ball control, and communication. I think one of the most important things is to coordinate your efforts. It’s sometimes difficult to communicate when solo queuing, and that can lead to multiple players going for the ball at the same time and ensuing in chaos.  However, when you do communicate, the teamwork makes the success ten times more rewarding.The community is a mixed bag. I’ve met some pretty salty players, but that’s why there’s a mute button. I also run into many people who are very friendly and try to communicate. Most people, whether friendly or not, spam “Savage!” and “Wow!” whenever anyone scores a goal.This game fits any mood – whether it’s falling asleep at your desk at 3:00 am, playing super seriously, or just messing around.For me, it never gets boring. There is always room for improvement, there is nothing as rewarding as scoring a sick aerial goal."

Or I guess Rocket League?Rocket League is one of those ideas you're surprised has not been done yet. But it's totally been done before. What Rocket League does is refine, simplify, and intensify.Pros:Stellar and easy-to-grasp controls that invoke ""Easy to learn but hard to master""Stellar visuals and optimization on PC. The grass looks magnificant!A good variety of cosmetics to use.Absolutely god damn fun. Matches are energetic, intense, filled with determination, and sometimes insane errors.A neato soundtrack. Personal favorites areWhiplashandFireworks.Nitpicks:The game does not have a lot of unique modes beyond it's simple Soccer mode, with several varients like Snow Day.Cons:The ranking system (As of Season 1) is absolutely broken. Those who have fallen far behind the ladder have absolutely zero chance to rank up. As of Season 2, the ranking system will be swapped to something like CS:GO, so this will definitely fix these problems.As with any multiplayer game, it's supplement AI are not the best to play with, making modes like Season not so enjoyable to play. Thankfully, most online matches normally don't involve them, so they don't affect the game in a similar fashion that bots do in CS.The ReviewRocket Leagueis the result of a well-refined concept that's made it's debut back in 2008 asSuper-Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars. While SARPBC had a whole lot more modes, maps and content,Rocket Leagueis a lot more light in content, but that's because that was something the devs didn't focus on. Instead,Rocket Leagueis a much more refined and focused game.The game plays and feels amazing, and this is because of what's changed since then. The cars have weight to them, which gives the player the feeling that they have much more control.It's team-based play is also very solid, because you're playing as an individual player, there's a lot of real coordination and technique that makes it so different from playing, say Fifa. It's so refreshing to play a sport game that brings out something that most of those games don't, and it's the indidviduality of the players. The want to stand out among others, or to stay behind and support your friends, that's the ingenuity ofRocket League.It does lack in content however. It may be offputting that the simple, Soccer-based mode is really the only mode in the game, and a lot of the maps are in a similar layout, but that's what makes this game feel so refined. It's excusable because it's so fun to continue playing match after match. It's like Soccer;It never gets old.It's presentation is solid too. It has a surprisingly beast soundtrack, with the likes of Hollywood Principle stealing the show. It's visuals, while not on par with big Triple AAA games, looks crisp and beautiful. The grass on the fields look mighty damn shiny, and the cars models are smiplistic and detailed.Psyonix did a fantastic job taking a good concept, execute it once, and refine it years later into a much more enjoyable experience. Rocket League may not have a ton of maps, or game modes, but what it has is a game that will continues to amaze (and♥♥♥♥♥♥ me to all sorts of levels.TL;DR - Rocket League is a energetic and satisfying game that feels more like soccer then games like Fifa.

,Recommended,252950,19882021,"Posted: 23 December, 2015",all,Cool Guy,"I was recommended this game after offhandedly mentioning it to a friend, and it ended up being one of my favourite games of the year.  Where to start? It's multiplayer focused football with cars. Some people seem to dismiss it as a simple game that will get boring fast, but I would disagree. The game's core mechanics are so well polished that playing feels fluid and natural from the get-go, especially if you play racing games. The car handling is very simple, nothing like the likes of GRID or GTA IV. I think this handling system is good for the game, complex handling mechanics (gear systems, realistic turning, etc) would probably hamper the experience, when the game can be very fast paced and precision heavy at times. At higher levels of play you will use your boost to fly through the air, tilting your car to direct it towards the ball in mid-air. This requires practice and precision, and is very satisfying when executed correctly. This game has a high skill ceiling in that regard, where goals and saves can be pulled off, and the difficulty of them can skyrocket depending on the situation.The multiplayer is good, there are dedicated servers, in fact ONLY dedicated servers, which is something I've never really come to think about. The game modes range from 4v4, 3v3, 2v2 to 1v1. All are different in how they are played, but 3v3 is the mode I play the most and the mode that is considered ""standard"" in the game. In 3v3 you can learn about player rotation on the pitch, defensive roles, attacking roles and backup roles. Look these up on the steam guides if you are curious. The servers are split into casual and ranked games, where casual games do not impact your MMR or ""elo"" but do give you EXP and affect your all-time stats, and ranked games will impact your ranked points and MMR as well as your all-time stats. The ranked system uses points to monitor progress, starting at around 200, and you gain points on victory and lose them when you lose a match. I play this game alone mostly, and an issue I have with casual games were teamstacking in 3v3 games, where I would be matched against 3 players who were all friends, and the games would be fairly one-sided from having to play against a team that most likely communicated their play amongst themsleves. Since switching to ranked games I have not felt the urge to go back, there is even a mode called ""Solo Standard"" which is exclusively for single players looking to play 3v3 without the worries of facing a coordinated team.Teamplay is a large part of rocket league, all modes except 1v1 require coordination to be played well, perhaps with the exception of 4v4 mode appropriately named ""Chaos"" where there are so many cars that strategy and balance dips from having too many cars on the pitch at once. You will have to learn simple things like proper round start etiquitte, player rotation, setting up passes, scoring goals from passes, scoring aerials, outmaneuvering the opponent, and so on. The community is a mixed bag, sometimes you will encounter jerks who spam chat-commands ironically, sometimes you will have a pleasant game full of sportsmanlike players. So not that different from most other communities, I'd say. You can even turn text chat off if you want to.Overall I can say that this game is one of my favourite games of the year, and I will continue to play it... indefinetely? Maybe."

I've honestly been doubtful to get this one, but don't have any regrets buying it - not even after playing it on and off for a good year.After first being introduced to it by watching E3, I told myself to keep this game in mind because I might want to buy it sometime in the (distant) future. A little bit later, checking out some twitch as usual, this game was just everywhere. So I watched some streams and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Much more than I had anticipated. So eventually I decided to just buy this game and give it a go. I have to say it's been long since I bought a game at full price, but it has been totally worth it.What I like+ Gameplay is VERY enjoyable: intense, hilarious, chaotic and rageworthy+ Easy to learn, hard to master+ Tutorial + training areas!+ Matches are short (5 minutes), making it ideal for casual players also+ You don't need friends for this game, however I do recommend playing with them+ AI (computer controlled) cars are pretty decent+ Car customization!+ Game looks gorgeous+ Some nice catchy tunes that totally get you into the mood for some intense Racing/football+ It's best played with a controller, but mouse and keyboard do work fine too+ Price tag is about rightWhat I don't like- Fairly toxic community at times (hence why I recommend to play with friends)- AI cars (not always so decent)ConclusionOverhyped?

I have to say it's probably one of my favorite multiplayer experiences ever. NO LAG on online multiplayer, great graphics but still very well optimized, and a fun community that simply loves the game. I'm not one to choose these kinds of indie competitive games but the gameplay at least had me wanting to use it as a local multiplayer game (yes, it can have up to 4-way splitscreen). However, after playing one match online I ended up playing for a few hours straight.I highly reccomend this game. Since it is new, the player base is fairly large (about 40,000 in matchmaking from 11pm to 2am) it will surely give you hours upon hours back on your money.10/10 Will binge play this until my fingers bleed.P.S.

It is one of those games that must be part of any collection even with it being relatively new still, and has amazing replayability.Even with around 250 hours in game, I still feel experienced enough to say that with a mixture of gameplay styles and techniques to try such as aerials; it makes the game much more fun than it appears at first view. It's not just a demolition derby football game, it has a diverse set of mechanics which makes it differ from any other game and unique in it's own way.It does help to play with friends, but playing by yourself is also just as good. Playing with friends means funny muck ups and great goals are even better as you get to share them with people who are enjoying the game as much as you, and makes for great experiences, but by yourself is just as good sometimes.The concept behind the game is so simple yet can be difficult to master when compared with footage with really good players who harness their car's ability to move in different ways for the advantage, but then that is just more reason to play the game to become better and learn how to score goals in different ways."

If you're only buying this for multiplayer, I recommend waiting until the devs sort things out.Vehicular Football/Soccer is not something one usually thinks about, so it's not something one would imagine they need in their life.In a single match of Rocket League, I learned that it's something most people need more of in their lives. I still have much more to experience out of this game, so I may update the review as I go. As it stands, Rocket League is an incredibly fun indie racing-sports game. You are a car/truck, and you play football/soccer by driving into a giant bouncy ball. You have rocket boosters. You have vertical jump boosters. You can wall climb, ceiling crawl, bicycle kick, and sometimes explode.Rocket League is the embodiment of ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"" gameplay. This means it is very accessible, but there's skills you can work on to improve your game. If you play just one match of Rocket League, you'll know how to play all the basics. For the advanced, there's learning better ball control with double-tapping, flying, and so on.Teamwork is absolutely effective. Get this, get your friends to get this, join a party and play as a team. Just like actual football/soccer! With flying, exploding, spinning, rocket cars.I'm still working through the game's content. There's offline exhibition games, a Season mode, online play, and tutorials. I'm hoping for some really intense online bracket tournaments involving multiple teams, but so far I've only played regular online matches. There's also local split-screen play, and cross-play with PS4 players! As of right now, I feel like most players are PS4 online, because no one seems to use the chat at all.I have one small gripe, but it may just tie in to the server troubles mentioned above: the matchmaking could be better. The matchmaking system is competent when it first sets a game up, but if a player drops, it doesn't seem to try to bring new players in. If a whole team leaves after a match, sometimes it will hang on the matchmaking for so long, it's faster for your team to just quit that match and create a whole new match, with new matchmaking that works. But bear this workaround in mind, and you can avoid those waiting periods.Update Edit: Although there's no traditional dedicated server listings, you can setup Private Matches with just your buddies or what not. Retracted that comment from matchmaking gripes.Just pure, nonsensical, sporting good times to be had here. A must have unless you despise racing, or sports, but honestly, you might even find yourself having a good time then too.To think that I spent 2 years hyping over Batman: Arkham Knight, and that whole ♥♥♥♥♥torm goes down, and I have more fun with Rocket League in fifteen minutes than I probably ever will with that game. And for only $20."

Why?I start playing this game with the intent to only play an hour, and realize many hours later how long I've actually been playing. Whether I'm experiencing a bitter defeat, a glorious victory, or a five minute overtime bout I'm still having a blast. I yell, I shout, I pump my fist in hoorah for that aerial save I just made. And Istillcan't get enough of this game.Rocket League is a very well polished sportsy footballesque game where you drive cars and try to shoot the ball into the opposing teams goal. It's a simple concept but with all the moves and tricks your cars can perform there is suprising depth in how to play as an indvidual and as a team. You can perform all types of moves, you can do just about any type of roll or flip perceivable, single jumps, double jumps, and you can even fly with your boost. This is one of the few games that I've had this level of drive to master my play, and with two whole days of game time logged away I feel like I've really just mastered the basics and am just now scratching the surface on higher level play.I'm often a bit hestitant to jump into online games, especially ranked. I find ranked matches in general to be stressful and a little too adrenaline intensive, yet in Rocket League I've had nothing but a blast playing competitively even when I was as green as the turf I was driving on. I've never even hesitated to try new things in competitive games or to try and master aerial shots and other such techniques that are easy to screw up. In short, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and the drive to better my play has been a contributing factor to my enjoyment. Playing with a friend makes the game all the more enjoyable, being able to shout at each other over VOIP about each amazing shot we convert or each epic save we make makes an already exciting game all the more awesome.Bottom line. This game is FUN. It's just fun. You jump in, you find a match, you play, and you have fun. It's not overly complex, it doesn't add lots of un-needed features. It's straight up action packed fun.P.S. And of course, like any good driving game, you can customize your ride so you can kick butt in style."

Psyonix's Rocket League, the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, finds imbecilic fun in pulling turbocharge-fronted flips in a baked good truck, and the white-knuckle framework in working with your social occasion to control the mammoth ball on offense and resistance. The smart and liquid ludicrousness of Rocket League wires into an authentic respectable time – paying little personality to servers that now and again work perfectly.The crucial mode puts two social events of three in obviously differing however execution unclear vehicles (however 1v1, 2v2, and 4v4 assortments exist) as they race here and there the pitch looking for after the class' greater than typical likeness a soccer ball. The goliath thing is, you don't have to know anything about driving diversions or soccer to play. The models are basic: drive really energetic around glorious, flickering, neon shaded fields and do bolster traps while trying to crush a never-endingly ricocheting ball into a misleadingly tight space.The heart of Rocket League lives in that thought unfathomable change. It's thanks in wide part to the utilization of what I would call ""material science in any case,"" where the laws of gravity and essentialness get a splendid climb to think about driving on the dividers and housetop, and unconventional mid-air heading changes that would condense the driver in this present reality. By the by, its astounding change is so arcadey and fulfilling that I reliably need to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the traps when an immediate push or pound will do.Furthermore, those traps are the principle surface-scratching look at Rocket League's layer of philosophy under the unmistakably tumultuous squashing of metal. Tapping your ricochet get places you unmistakable all around, where tapping it again with a course held plays out a somersault, barrel roll, or bike kick. It may sound clear – and truly, it is – yet timing a hit to interface with a speeding ball, and controlling the course you send it cruising, down to right edges, takes some expertise. There are genuine, uncommon levels of fulfillment to be tapped when you see an accessory sorting out a shot from the corner and read the condition, pummeling on the brakes to push the ""go"" into the objective with an impeccably masterminded barrel roll. It's electric.Outside of the enraged and inebriating gameplay, Rocket League has deficient couple of parts to substance out the experience. The player-advancement structure – where winning matches, performing in-redirection deeds, or doing anything truly, wins you encounter – opens to some degree stable of insane vehicles or therapeutic decals and embellishments.It's engaging to drive a truck wearing a sombrero, without question, however since there's in every way that really matters zero mechanical refinement between the dozen or so sportsters, trucks, exotics, a couple thought models and no shy of what one hardened yogurt truck (select to PS4 players), there's no certified estimation improvement that developments how you play a match. Recollecting that is all superbly sensible for a level multiplayer playing field, I would have expected to see every auto go on the qualities and insufficiencies determined by their certifiable accessories: wear autos as snappy however difficult to-handle strikers, trucks and vans as slower yet more grounded guardians, and the adjusted yet all around advantageous roamers some place in the inside. It appears like a missed chance to incorporate a more basic association with your cars in the parking spot, particularly when making a squad to play through a whole season.By the by, there is an other advancement twist found in comprehending how to utilize the shocking mechanical noteworthiness of Rocket League's different controls and whimsical material science. Whether that twist takes you through online focused or arranged matches, lovely showcases, up to four-player neighborhood obliging play on split-screen, or each of the 36 weeks of a completely widened season mode, the Rocket League experience is constantly about getting into the going with throttle-pumping match.Recalling there are leaderboards to track your bits of learning and general limit, Rocket League servers battle to bolster the converging of PlayStation 4 and PC players seeking after for same and cross-arrange matchmaking sessions, rendering the lion's share of Rocket League's online segments – including the online party structure – spotty, most perfect circumstance. Luckily, the AI is critical on either burden setting above Rookie, both as partners and adversaries, so Rocket League doesn't lose much in a totally separated proximity, which is uncommon, since its online suite is, in a manner of speaking, unsteady.Rocket League is a phenomenal circumstance where the execution of a key, over the top accepted is so solid along these lines beguiling that it needn't issue with a monstrous measure of additional parts around it. The surge of tearing over the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on focus with a hold bike kick is sufficient to bring me back on different occasions for only ""one more match,"" even without basic improvement frameworks. Rocket League is a phenomenal, silly, simple to learn and hard to star development sports redirection which requests that you get a few sidekicks and play a few rounds.(All reviews are captured from the Internet and hustled through a royal ine of synonym tools three times both for laughing and to store time.

,Not Recommended,252950,29866540,Posted: 11 February,all,Interknet,"I would recommend this game, but there's a lot of annoying things that come with it.The Community.Oh the community in this game. Have you ever played CSGO? Yeah, it's like that but from what I've experienced it's worse.You'll get called out for being a crappier teammate quicker and more frequently, even though what counts to having a good teammate is yourself. I mean this by the fact that Doubles more-so than Standard is like marriage; it either works, or it doesn't.You can't simply have 2 people playing in the exact same way, otherwise you won't accomplish anything. But you'll get called out on it because your teammate is nothing other than a sore loser. It's nobodies fault that you were paired with someone who has the same playstyle and isn't compatible when it comes to Doubles. Kidding, it's your fault, YOU suck, YOU are the problem. (Sarcasm, if you missed it).The DevelopersI wish the developers put as much work into the game when it comes to dealing with the community, rather than focusing it on more DLC and maps that nobody truely asked for. Sure, some of the maps are good, but when a lot of them suck it's not helped by the fact you're limited to a preference-based system which seems more like a placebo effect.The DLC isn't anything special, the cars are just from other games they pair up with to make DLC in the game and the most annoying difference is that the other game who makes the DLC on Rocket League usually supplies their DLC for free.Though, I don't mind, I wouldn't be using the DLC anyway. The only point to DLC that I see is to support the developers, but I can't support the developers in such a way when they can't fix the simple things instead of the half-arsed features that deal with disruptive players.The report feature is good (not really), but for what good it does I might as well just not bother playing if I'm looking to enjoy the game which is hard to do when you're put with people that come across as if they grief regularly. The bans are pretty lax, which is a shame because a lot of players that do cause problems are the ones that pick up and play for 20 minutes at a time maybe, then come back 1-2 days later giving plenty of time for a ban to wear off. There's no real reason to care about being banned for griefing in this game. Hell, I've griefed a few times to put it to the test, but I've never seen a ban come from it.Ranked feels simplistic and, again, half-arsed. Sure, it may function, but it's hardly anything special. Matches still seem to go off a hidden point system, for example; you win, you rank up but the next match you lose you rank down. So here's the problem, at a lot of ranks you can experience the same skill level of players, and that doesn't work so well when you're trying to rank up to what 'should' be considered a good rank. See in CSGO, MGE or DMG is about the average. You can feel the difference to being Nova 2 as opposed to DMG, but in Rocket League Prospect 3 is pretty much the same as Challenger 3, only you can use that 'rank' to stroke your ego when insulting your teammates and such.Conclusion, some whatAll in all, I can't recommend this game. It's not fun anymore and it's dragged down mostly by the community, and the features needed for it to be fun are non-existant even after almost 2 years of it's release.Eventually I'd like to see that bans aren't as lax and the ranked system is better along with the report system. It was good for the first 2 seasons, but it seems the developers couldn't keep up with the increase in players and more so the toxic ones.Hopefully all the money earned from eSports and the DLC will go towards improving the issues aforementioned."

It's a game that you can either pick up every once in a while or play it religiously. Sure, at the beginning of the game there is a bit of a grind to get all of the default cars/decals/etc, and there are many other items available through crates, events and DLC. The community is okay (there are some toxic players, but many players in this game are pretty nice) but make sure to always have a teammate to queue up with. The rank system is kinda messed up, as it could take multiple games to division up but then you could lose that division with just 1 loss. Also, there is a new ban system for blacklisted words! Most other PC players don't care, but PS4 and Xbox kids probably will report you for anything that their mommies don't wanna see on their screen.OVERALL a very good game, I would recommend it to:-casual gamers-competitive gamers-people who like sports/cars/action-people who are ready to have their life sucked into the black hole that is Rocket League:)"

(I'm still pretty bad myself) I play this game pretty much every day and I never get bored.I can play with friends, either competitively or just for fun. In competitive mode, you can climb through ranks Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Champion, and if you make it through Champion you will become a Grand Champion. If I want to play for fun, I could get a big group together and make a private match using a bunch of different mutators and gamemodes, including ones we made up. If there's no one to play with, I can still just play solo or play any other mode with random people. If I don't feel like doing that and I just want to improve, I can play some of the many custom training packs made by people, or just play the ones made by Psyonix.Also this game has a level system. It goes Rookie (1-9) Semi-Pro (10-19) Pro (20-29) Veteran (30-39) Expert (40-49) Master (50-59) Legend (60-69) and Rocketeer (70-75)This game even goes beyond gameplay. The customization is pretty much endless, having decals, cars, wheels, boosts, trails, goal explosions, toppers, antenaes, and engine sounds. Also you can customize your car's colors for each team (Blue and orange). Also, certain items can come painted. This will change the color of it from the default, which you can use to your customization needs.There are just so many things to do in this game, and the community is great. Obviously there are some people who aren't so great, but I'm sure every game community has those people.In conclusion, I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to play competitively, play for fun, practice, collect items, climb through ranks, and maybe even become good enough to play in tournaments for prizes."

It's got jump jacks and jet engines that you can actually use to fly for a brief period. It drives great. You can even drive along the wall. Drifting is as simple as holding down a button. Easy to use camera controls and UI elements make sure that you know where the ball is. The presentation is amazing and can get you hyped very easily. The game itself is simple to learn but with the boost system there are some very advanced techniques to figure out. Multiplayer supports 4-player splitscreen as well as 8-player online, even both at the same time. And if you're playing by your lonesome, the AI players can keep you company. Did I forget to mention this game also has crossplay with the PS4 version?Rocket League is excellent and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's enjoyed arcade-style sports games like NBA Jam or NHL 3-on-3 Arcade."

And you unlock the items just by playing matches, which makes it very easy to get new items.The camera options are very convenient, Allowing you to change the FOV, Height, Angle, and distance of the camera.Now, for the actual game, the seasons mode is very fun and competitive, allowing you to pick from different teamates, and to choose how many cars are on the teams. 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 are the option. 4v4 is my favourite so far though, as it's rather chaotic.Possibly the best thing about seasons mode is that even by yourself you still get very competitive, and that's something that i dont think many games deliver on.The music is a bit garbled and im not sure whether or not its supposed to play all the time, as it usualy stops within a few secconds.Overall, for a game that was just released, it is very fun and i'd recommend it to everyone, whether they like sports or not.

Surprisingly competitive once you learn a few basic maneuveres, after this you begin to climb the skill tier. Simple yet efficient tiers break up the skill gaps into pools at a decent rate for beginners. As a rookie you will spalsh around with the other casuals and gain a grasp for hitting the ball and maintaining control of the car. Next comes Semi-pro, in this pool you start to get a feel and learn to see where the ball is flying and position yourself accordingly. At Pro you're on your way, this is where the community opens up and stratergies become more meta and kick offs take some priority. Veteran feels like you're being thrown in teh deep end because higher tier Veterans have advanced onto flying with that car and Aerials become the go to plan of attack. Expert is where Crossing is how to beat the defence line having someone in the air to topple enemy teams. There are three higher tiers but im not quite there, being Master > Legend > Rocketeer. Occasionally ther servers are overloaded or lack some players so you get to be the big fish and splash around with lower tier players while the game finds some players more suited.Constant DLC is a awesome bonus, and new Mutator gamemodes make for an awesome custom mode with friends.Overall a decent game, whether you're a PS4 Casual to a Competitive Player it suites all."

When DLC came out, it was a bit of a downer, but thankfully it was just cosmetics. If people are dumb enough to buy cosmetics for a game they already paid money for, that's fine by me.However, after a year long break, I've returned to the single most toxic experience i've ever had in all of gaming.In ranked 2v2, your teammate votes to forfeit at the tender score of 0-1.They call you♥♥♥♥♥♥when really you're the one doing all the work.You can be winning 6-4 and then your teammate decides to join the other team after throwing abuse at you all match.You can mute them, but that seems unfair to the actually genuinely nice people on there.Reporting♥♥♥♥♥♥players does nothing either.I cannot recommend this game anymore.EDIT: I came back at the start of a competitive season, and over 70% of the people i played with were awful. now its more like 10%, quite far into the season, so I assume they got mad they were getting nowhere and went back to playing FIFA.

,Not Recommended,252950,31349765,Posted: 24 April,all,Retoro-San,"Rocket League is one of those games that is easy to learn and hard to master. It's one of those games I'll come back to because it's so easy to pick up for a measly five to ten minutes and set back down.There is a ton to learn in the game even if you are high up in the skill ranks, and grinding up the ranks can be a ton of fun.The game looks nice, the controls are fluent, and the competitiveness can get intense. That feeling of getting the game-winning shot in an overtime that has lasted for five or more minutes is ineffable. There's game modes coming out with consistent updates keeping this game alive for years to come. There's so much good to be said about the game itself, which is why I, like many others, have hundreds of hours in it. You'll easily get your $20 worth out of this game just by booting it up and learning the ropes for your first dozens of hours.However, the biggest flaw this game has is simply the community. If you want to get really competitive, you have to deal with it. It's by far the most toxic community I have ever encountered, and I have games such as CS:GO, LoL, and even some CoDs. This game takes the cake, and Psyonix will not do anything to stop it, which is my number one reason for the red thumbs down.Your mileage will likely vary, but I'm basing this review off of my experience. I personally cannot go into a 30 minute sitting without getting into at least one game without a severely toxic teammate. You would assume Psyonix would have at least an autoban implemented into the game for people that say certain phrases such as ""kys"" or ""****ing f**got."" I have invested over 450 hours into the game, and I have yet to hear or see the banning of a user who used such explicit and hateful language towards others. On top of that, you get the occasional teammate that will score on your own goal and throw the game just because, but I do not get those too often.""But, Retro, you can just turn off the chat completely/disable text chat."" Yes, but being realistic, this game requires a decent amount of communication. The sarcastic use of the quick chat messages is still being a little toxic and completely unhelpful to teammates. All it does is beat down your teammates and have them perform considerably worse for the rest of the match.If you plan to get this, go for it. It's a great game, however, the community is the absolute worst I have ever seen in a video game. I can't recommend more for you to get this only if you have nontoxic friends who are willing to help each other out and improve in the game together as a team. Solo queuing in doubles and 3v3s is an absolute nightmare due to the toxic players.Psyonix. Please. I will change my review the second you deal with toxic players the right way. Right now, too much of your community is a mess."

This game screams fun regardless of if you've played 1 hour or 1000 hours. Even if you're losing, you find yourself having fun. And that's the mark of a seriously great game, in my eyes.Rocket League can be played casually or competitively, boasting both unranked and ranked queues. It is a simple enough concept that people are already familiar with even before playing their first game (it's damn soccer dude, if you don't know you've been living under a rock very far away from Europe, possibly on the moon Europa). But then, it has such an incredibly high skillcap. You'd probably still be learning new manouevres and the like well into 2000 hours (give it time though).I don't play with a controller as I don't own one, but I know that 99% of people recommend controller over keyboard/mouse. And from an unbiased standpoint, I would agree, as the analogs make ball control and fine movement much easier than WASD or the like. Regardless, if you do choose to play keyboard like a dummie (read: like me), then consider making a custom bind that doesn't use the mouse.I could go on and on.

It simply is fascinating not only for adults or children but for everyone.Secondly, the skill ceiling of this game is higher than the skill ceiling I saw in any other game and actual pro players didn't reach that ceiling yet.The cars have differences, yes, but they are not that big of a deal and every hitbox/turning radius can be found in all regular cars so premium DLCs don't give you any advantages.That leads me to my next point: all DLCs are just cosmetic, that means new gamemodes and arenas will be free forever.The match length of 5 minutes is just perfect for both the eSports scene and for just playing a few matches to have fun, although you might find youself some hours later still playing Rocket League because it is that addictive.The developers just manage everything perfectly, yet they were/are just a small company:- Almost every good idea of the community has been implemented in some way, Psyonix works perfectly together with the community.- Almost one and a half year later the game still gets a ton of free updates/improvements and they care about the game and the community as if it just came out, yet they have made alot of money with Rocket League so they could just settle but they don't.- A lot of money from the keys for the crates flues directly into the eSports price pools.There are so many more aspects just as cross-platform gaming that makes the game to the best we have right now in my opinion.Anyway, it just costs 20 bucks, often it is cheaper on steam sales or on third party sites, so just try it, I bet 99,99% of you won't regret it.However, thanks Psyonix for this awesome game!Now I have to get back into Rocket League just to play a few matches which will end in me still sitting here playing in 5 hours...What a game!"

,Recommended,252950,21923742,"Posted: 19 March, 2016",all,TekTonixx,"Rocket League is one of those games that pop up every once in awhile and make a statement and a change. The simplicity of the game which the eye first meets, to the fine complexity of the game that is not first seen but learned through experience is what makes the game so great. When you first start out you may not realize you can even double jump or fly, yet the game is still so fun. Then you spend some time playing your judgement gets better and you learn to make moves effectively in order to be competitive. You then notice there is training and so on and so forth you start changing camera settings and button layouts so you can be as effective as possible. This game has so many layers to it. Iv noticed there's a really steep learning curve to this game and then you plateau for awhile. Then you kind of step your way up and up as you then notice you have a few hundred hours into the game and your still not bored. Iv never seen a game that can keep me so addicted to and yet it's such a simple idea. What makes it great to me is how there is no aid in shooting or blocking it's your rocket car against physics and gravity with your car as the force to change its directing. It is so satisfying to score a game winning goal or the game winning save for your team. Once you start playing with friends and communicating you realize how serious it gets. I can't think of anything that's bad about this game the work they are doing is great and now Xbox one is coming into the cross play making it one of if not the first games to allow PC, PS4, and XBOX ONE to play together. If you have not bought this game and I was one who looked over it a few times but still had it on the back of my mind it was one of those, oh if I have an extra $20 I'll buy it. NOOO if you have the money I don't care what your plan was with that $50 steam card this game is a must have and I'm sure every single rocket league player can say the same thing there's much more than to what meets the eye."

,Recommended,252950,20210219,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,CONIN,"When released, I marked the game as ""Not Interested"" almost instantly because I don't dig neither soccer nor racing games that much.Then, I bought a Steam Controller when it became available through the Steam Store, thus, I received a copy of Rocket League (along Portal 2) but I didn't bothered at all and soon I forgot about.One of my Steam friends noticed my Rocket League in his Steam Activity feed and asked me to install the game. I said NO.The next day he asked me again to install the game. Again, I said NO. For the next two months or so he kept on asking me to install the game on a daily basis to no avail and I began to dislike the game even more because of that.One night I had literaly nothing to do, so I decided to install Rocket League but not to give it a chance but for my friend to stop asking me to. After the brief tutorial I lost track of time and realised I had been playing for about two hours. At the same time, my friend bought a Four Pack and shared the copies with some of our friends; at the blink of an eye we were all hooked into the game.In less than a week, 25 of us (and growing) already have the game and fell addicted harder than with heroin to the point of keep on playing for 7 continuous hours:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXaAaAor_F8PROS:- Addictive gameplay.- Lots of fun.- Easy to play.- Keyboard n' mouse playable.- Colorful visuals.- Great music.- Several game modes either online or local.- Powered by Unreal Engine.- Cross platform: you can play with friends that are in either PS4 or PC.- ""Mutators"": you can change the behavior of several things.- Highly suggested to play with your friends.- Lots of fun/sarcastic/senseless customizations.CONS:- Just a few stadiums to choose from.- Most of the cars' aesthetics look like they were designed by a toddler.- You can only choose from two team colors (orange or blue) when playing closed/private matches.- DLC's are somewhat irrelevant unless you really wish those extra cars and soundtrack, otherwise, get the base game."
,Recommended,252950,17112432,"Posted: 18 July, 2015",all,Sławetny Watażka,"Rocket League is, as description claims, a sequel to a PS3 game with an overly complicated title that probably contributed to the fact that not many people have heard about it. Neither have I, so when I watched a video of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, I was surprised to learn that Psyonix basically got the whole formula down with their first attempt; mechanics have hardly changed since the first entry into what might be now considered a sort of a franchise.That Rocket League is now enjoying far more success than its predecessor is very clear. Some of it may be down to the good timing since it doesn't have to compete with any AAA behemoth, some to PS+ free release and its very important strength: it is highly watchable and thus enjoyed free promotion from streamers and youtube personalities. But it doesn't fully explain the explosion of entusiasm it garnered.I think the main reason is that it's almost a perfect execution of its idea. It's addictive, but demanding. Fun from the getgo, but surprisingly deep in terms of its mechanics. If you have all these elements and add polish the result is an extremely engrossing competitive online game.You start off by simply attempting to hit a ball, preferably in the direction of the enemy's goal, but in the beginning every hit feels like a success. As you learn to have more control over the car, which thanks to the tactile responsiveness of controls happens at a rather quick pace, you find yourself mixing in more advanced techniques to gain the edge over the enemy. Occasionally you will manage to pull off an impressive move and you will want that to make this a norm. Once you get your technique down to an acceptable level it's no longer enough: you need to ""read the pitch"", predict your opponents' moves, cooperate with your teammates (or not, if you choose to play only 1v1 which you're entirely free to do!).This aspect of the game is hard to overstate.  Playing Rocket League constantly demands and leaves room for improvement, both individual and team-based and given that player base is currently huge and matchmaking great, you're going to matched against players just right for you.There is always one caveat that applies to every online game in existence: your mileage may vary. If you're unlucky, you may very well have unpleasant experience with it. You might end up with a series of online problems or bugs. You might very well not be so drawn in by the mechanics or be in the minority of people this game doesn't resonate with. But I say: buy. It's unlikely any of it will apply to you, and if the price is the only source of doubt for you, wait for the first sale and get it then, though in my opinion it's well worth the price of admission."

You do not need high resolution graphics for a game like this!Audio: The audio is clear, crisp and really good to listen too, specially the rocket sounds of each trail you have, being different and acting different!Controls: Depending how you play this game, the controls matter! I tried keyboard and mouse and although it is doable, it is a lot more complicated! I use an Xbox 360 controller to play this game, with BALL CAM always on and the game is suprt easy to master!Gameplay: The gameplay is basically football but with cars... Nothing special or hard to get your head around.  There are some amazing players in the game, with some amazing shots you can make and for some odd reason, playing this game actually makes me intense and tense up at times, when taking a shot.The game is good fun and I would recommend this game if you like cars and/ or football...

,Recommended,252950,24187951,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,AngryWolf,"HOTSHOT my friend already gave a fantastic review, so I will talk about one very important aspect to decide before buying the game:Keyboards vs. ControllersI never had to use a gamepad, okay sometimes I did for 2-player sessions on the same computer, but apart from that, this is the first time where I had to realize, controllers do give you the edge. And you need it if you don't want to uninstall the game after seeing others performing stunts practically impossible with the keyboard.In a very fast-paced game like RL keyboard handling can easily turn out sub-par, as the followings are difficult to do:Problems with keyboards* Precision turning in a very short amount of time. Keyboard is not analog, so you have 2 choices: hold A/D/W/S and release when done, or tap those buttons in a rapid succession. You will find that you are going to be slower than guys with controllers.* Acceleration and aerial turning forward is bound to the same key (W), so you would have to release W before flying in the desired direction. But, it is just too easy to forget, and you might end up forward flipping.Not all controllers are supported!This is one annoying feature, but after realizing that I would never become pro with a keyboard, I thought I could just dust off my old gamepad that I used to play NHL/FIFA/Mortal Kombat/NFS games with, but no, RL didn't even bother telling a message to me that, ""no I will just ignore your ***** controller!""So you will need either an Xbox 360 controller for PC (either wired or wireless, doesn't matter, as long as it is for PC you will get a suitable USB cable with it), or what is better: an Xbox One controller for PC. Why better? People say the sticks feel better, so you will feel them easier to handle.Oh yeah and PS controllers might work too but they aren't as convenient.Will I need to install a driver?No, at least on Windows 10 it's like plug and play.How the controller works in the gameIf you never had an Xbox controller like me, first thing to notice as a difference from regular controllers is that it has only 2 front buttons, rather than 4, and they will work like this:Front right button: accelerationFront left button: breaking / going backwardsTop left stick: turning (on ground and aerial)A: jumping / pressing accept buttons in dialogsB: nitro boostX: driftingY: changing camera mode / pressing cancel buttonsTop right stick: camera angleD-pad: navigation in the menuHardest parts are getting used to:Accelerating and going backwards with the buttons on the frontAcceleration + nitro boosting + forward flipping at the same time (note: actually with nitro no need to accelerate)Not accidentally hitting the jump button when you want to use the nitro boost.ConclusionAt first it will be very hard to get used to the controller, it's like learning the game again, I actually went through the tutorials again, it felt really dumb. But keep practicing, because in the end I am pretty sure you will beat the guys using a keyboard having the same skill level as you."

You play as a rocket car which you can custom design via unlockable special effects and truck body parts. The goal of the game is oh so simple, get the ball in the other teams net but the gameplay and strategy on accomplishing this is where Rocket League becomes something truly special. Everything from the music, graphics and sound effects draws you into the gameplay and really puts you at center stage of all the action regardless of your skill level. The art style is right on the cusp of the so-called ""Uncanny Valley"" meaning everything looks just real enough to not look like a cartoon, but just cartoony enough to keep the ambience fun and light. If you can convince some friends to take the plunge with you, this game is exponentially more fun when you're playing with friends and the game DOES feature multiple split screen options so local multiplayer is not only possible, but comfortable. I was having connection issues when attempting to play online, so online play might be spotty, but the game is quite popular already and it's literally the first couple days of the game's release. Having said that this game is worth having just for the local play with friends alone and I can see this title being a huge hit for the Steambox release coming up soon. BUY THIS you wont be disappointed."

Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh.

This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.Master - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.Legend - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""Rocketeer - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will.

Forget the referees and the dirty plays, this is a game built on adrenaline! The duking out of BattleBots and the overwhelming success of pulling off incredible, aerial manuevers. All in an attempt to score a goal with a seemingly arid ball is always exciting. You sport orange and blue RC cars for their respective teams, both of which come in a good number of models with customization options, such as a different shade of the existing colors, paint jobs, tires, antennas, flags and hats. I would say the variety of dome arenas are a visual marvel with a large amount of terrain to cover ground in. Though unlike its predecessor, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, Rocket League lacks any bumps, dips or hills on their playing fields. Despite this minor discrepancy, which I'm sure time will give light to with more DLC, I wouldn't miss out on the physics sporting event of the millenia for it!"

That said theres an odd bit of lag which can be expected, its hugely improved since release.- The game is clumsy in the sense that is difficult to master, everyone has a level playing field in that there are no stat changes or perks etc. Ive never felt cheated by this game.CONS:- Perhaps there could be some variants on the types of maps, you could have goals at different angles, different shaped arenas, or traps/death pits etc. I think it would have to be tested but it would be DLC i would probably invest in.- Whilst its good as it is, maybe some more customisation on the cars would be good. All superficial of course, maybe editable number plates etcVERDICT?This game burst on the scenes out of nowhere, I loved it so much playing it on PS plus that I had to have it on steam and give the devs my money.

In reality those features do nothing but take you further from what you want, just football.In rocket league the aim is to get the ball in the opponents goal more times than they can get it in your goal in a set amount of time. You can use flips and rocket boosting to get the ball in the goal and stop it going in yours. And that's the game. It may sound minimal and in reality it is, but because its so minimal it means getting into the game is incredibly easy. But mastering these mechanics will take forever.Every single game is different as everyone is better at something or pefer a certain playstyle. Unlike fifa where you're worrying about the multiple other ""features"" screwing you over, in rocket league it really is just some people in cars with a ball. And that's why this game is great.The ONE negative about this game is the servers. The reason the servers have been taking a dump on themselves is because of the immense amount of people trying to get on, now its only around 10k people on pc. But ps4 players who paid for ps+ got this for free this month so they've had 100k+ people trying to get on. This was a massive underestimate from the developers and I personally think it screwed up their launch immensley. However it seems to be running ok now so lets hope they've got it under control.With the correct attitude from the developers this game could become one of the most popular sports games on pc. People thinking this would become a big esports game aren't thinking straight. It's a game based entirely around the physics of a ball. It may become as big as FIFA's pro scene but thats a mere scratch on what esports really is.I rate the game 10/10 as it does what it does in a fantastic way."

Essentially soccer with cars and a giant ball, this game has you drive around an enclosed arena, bumping into other players as you try to knock the ball into the goal. But in keeping with the arcade spirit, the physics are a bit on the unrealistic side, which is why your car can hop up and twist, you can drive up the sides of walls, and head-on crashes only cause you to bounce back (though, admittedly, the physics may be too unbelievable for those looking for a real athletic challenge). You also can play matches up to four-on-four, either online, via split-screen, or in a mix of the two, though the more populated matches tend to be a bit too chaotic. There's even an exhibition mode where you can play against the computer, and these matches also go up to four-on-four, though this gets old pretty quickly -- well, unless you customize your car with a pirate flag, purple boost smoke, and a sombrero.

,Not Recommended,252950,24264662,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,3bdelilah,"Let me get right to it. Rocket League is an amazingly addictive game with a lot of depth. Just when you thought you know how to play, other higher-level players will come and shatter that illusion. It also feels amazing seeing players pull off amazing moves, and then after several matches you try looking badass, failing each time, until it does work, and you get progressively better at it. It's a textbook ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kinda game in that regard. The controls are responsive, and it also looks amazing visually at max settings. But... why a negative review then? Hear me out, don't down-thumb like a sheep because I don't ""like it"". Because I do. I love Rocket League, my play time is proof of that.Then what is it? On the surface it's very simple, but deep beneath it's a very troubling issue: Psyonix has announced a crate system á la Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2. And as far as I'm concerned it's literally the worst timing to implement such a controversial system, with the recent outcry regarding the CSGOLotto-gate and the two little sh*ts Martin and Syndicate, as well as Valve's involvement in all this (going as far as ""advising and consulting"" these shady websites). Psyonix was - and to a certain extent still is - a developer that I hold highly because of their pro-consumer attitude with a lot of effort put into free post-launch content. To keep affording their contributions, they already sold DLC with new cars and other cosmetic items, but I didn't mind. Why didn't I mind? Because you already knew what you'd buy, it's not a surprise. You can spend the 2$ on a DLC pack and know exactly what you'll get.But with this new upcoming system, it'sliterallygoing to be a lottery. And I know what you're thinking, ""lol he uses the word literally wrong"". No, I mean it. It's literally a lottery. To make matters worse, while regular gambling is regulated at a minimum age of 18, even children can play Rocket League. Crates will be dropped ""free"" randomly during regular gameplay, but you can only open that crate if you buy a key. Which essentially means it's literally gambling: you never know what's in a crate unless you spend the money on a key to open it. Maybe it's a great and rare item, maybe it's a duplicate you already have dozens of. And to top it all off, you won't even be able to sell your items on the Steam Community Market. ""We don't want it to make prone to exploitations"", they say. But that's bullcrap, it's only because of the console versions that they won't - or can't - implement a selling system. So what happens when you've spent money on this lottery only to have many duplicates? Who knows, probably you could just use the current trading menu with five items of a certain class that convert to one item of a higher class.This is not just about you. This is also not just about disabling the crate system and just playing the game as we used to. This is about a morally grey system that can take advantage of vulnerable people for uncreative, greedy financial benefit. And I don't want to take part in this, and neither should you. But I expect thumbs down and ignorant comments."

As a result, the “original iteration” of this game left much to be desired.SARPBC was the first self-published title from Psyonix and they have actually gone back and tended to several, if not all of the issues with the game, what a lovely bunch of human beings.Skip over to 2015, Pysonix announce a brand new, aptly named sequel, Rocket League.GameplayMany of the previous titles core gameplay mechanics have been preserved, this is still very much a physics based soccer game in which two opposing teams are looking to score extravagant goals using their presumably named Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars (I’m never writing that again).Generally, the game plays out something like this:Players start in one of four possible starting points near their respective goals.The Ball is placed in the middle of the pitch.After a 3 second timer, the match begins with the above rules in place.The opposing teams try to get The Ball into each other’s goals.Players can pick up Boosts, laid out across the map, to slowly increase (small boosts) or totally fill (larger, floating boosts) their Boost meters allowing for rapid manoeuvring and repositioning around the map.Once a goal is scored, the scoreline is updated and the game resets to the first point above.It isn’t all that easy to see how a game as simplistic as this could be so captivating, and yet Psyonix have managed to make Rocket League an incredibly fun filled title, packed with goals that’ll make you scream OMG, saves that’ll have you going WTF and – regardless of your experience – you’ll most certainly make some costly mistakes, at which you’ll be going Whoops…Games have a timer of 5 minutes, not including replays or Overtime (when a match ends in a draw, Overtime kicks in and the game takes on a “Golden Goal” or “Sudden Death” format in which the first goal scored ends the game and wins the match).You’ll find that a lot can happen in those five minutes – you may also find yourself unnaturally invested in winning – Rocket League is as much a game of skill and refined mechanics as it is about positioning and, ultimately, a bit of luck with your rebounds!The game is easy to pick up and although I recommend using a controller, it is certainly playable with a keyboard and at the end of the day, that comes down to personal preference.ProsStriking visuals across the vast range of environments and effects. Everything from the rocket trails to the sand particles of the Wasteland map – all look incredible.Improved physics, consistency and playability. The physics of the Rocket League universe feel just right, allowing a novice player to quickly familiarize themselves with the mechanics of the game, whilst also allowing an experienced player to continually hone their skills to perfection, the results of which can be extraordinary to watch.Several Gameplay modes including Casual (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4), Competitive (1v1, 2v2, 3v3) and some Mutator game modes which affect variables such as Ball Weight/Size, Gravity and Boost amount.Runs on any decently spec’d machine, provided you adjust the graphical settings accordingly.DLC is cheap and you are supporting a lovely group of developers, as demonstrated by their willingness to go back and tend to the various issues with SARPBC. They also extended the time that we could play a certain game mode as everyone loved it. Thanks Psyonix!In-game drops that allow you to customize your vehicle including hats, flags, decals and rocket trails, all of which can be used interchangeably.Something amazing will probably happen every single match. Probably. OMG! What a save!ConsAs with all online, Competitive game queues/modes, Rocket League has its fair share of people that will flame you, although negative experiences will surely be few and far between and flaming in Casual matches is virtually non-existent.Players are free to choose a region in which to play in, so you may be matched with people who have 250+ ping, this doesn’t happen often as they are mostly putting themselves at a disadvantage here, but if you get one on your team, you probably won’t enjoy their company.#@&!Pysonix made the bold decision to not give up on their original concept and this time, that concept has been realized almost flawlessly.Ultimately, Rocket League is an intuitive, incredibly fun filled title that has the potential to provide an endless amount of entertainment, Psyonix are aware of this and are constantly listening to community feedback in order to give us the best experience possible.It’s refreshing to have a dev team so intent on at least CONSIDERING our feedback, let alone taking it into consideration.TL;DR: Psyonix have taken their original concept of rocket-powered battle cars playing soccer and turned it into an engaging, intuitive title that anyone can have fun with."

,Recommended,252950,20291109,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,DAGGS,"What a great game! I´ve had it since the Sale started and I already have 16 hours on it and I´m addicted.The controls are perfect, the car responds exactly like you expect it, so if you mess up, it's your fault.The game design is great, from opening the game to being inside a online room, it takes usually less than a minute, you're always playing and almost never waiting.The menues are clean and you can understand everything right away, the only thing in that regard I didn´t understand at first is that the bodies, tires and all the rest of the things you can change, have absolutely no bearing in how your car will drive, they´re all just decorative, which was a little confusing at first (the placebo effect made me think the newer cars were faster).Being in Chile, my ping is always really bad (it seems that the only servers in South America are in Brazil), I'm around 150/200 and people nearer the server have 20/30 ping, so sometimes it gets laggy, but the game is playable the same, I can make goals and win games even if I don't have the best ping in the room, they made a great job making it so everyone has the same chances. But I hope still that they open some servers in other countries.The only bad point for me (it seems I'm in the minority) is that I don't like the music, I have to mute it, it's all fruity techno and I feel like this game should be more heavy metal, but it's OK, you don't need the music, and during gameplay you only hear the cars.If you're on the fence, buy it, it's an amazing, well-designed game, made for competitive people, the rush you feel when you finally learn the controls and make a great play that ends in a goal is incredible."

(No hate on sports fans, I'm just a lazy ♥♥♥♥er sitting on his desk all day long)+ Soundtrack is great+ The car customization, it's really wide and you have a ton of options to choose from. (More coming ^^)+ The game runs on my pc really well. Can play it on ultra with fps rarely dropping below 60.+ Unreal engine+ Game's price is spot on+ DLC is worth buying if you're interested in having more customization options. Since the DLC is cosmetic only, it won't affect gameplay and thus is really well done.CONS- Can get a bit grindy for some (personally idc)- Community has become pretty toxic lately, but what would you expect from a competitive game anyways. (Huge thank you for the small heroes who aren't being toxic, I love you all!)And to sum this review up, this game is 100% worth getting.

I would say how you get better/stronger in the game is from your own determination and practice. Even so, you can still have some fun when you start playing and it will only get better from there when you start mastering more advanced aspects.Lastly, the community is alright though it is still better than most. If you learn and understand the key aspects behind how teamwork works in the game such as Positioning and rotations(these should be fundamental), then people in your team shouldn't be giving you much trouble. However the game may get bit too competitive in which players may start throwing insults especially if your beating them by alot. Nonetheless, there are still people out there that will always complain about stuff but its tolerable in this game.In Conclusion, there is more to this simple game where it creates more enjoyment as you become better as a player.Understand key concepts and you will enjoy this game. I apologize for the large body of texts, perhaps dot points may have been better."

Key factors are the very smooth controls and probably the best learning experience any game can offer:In the first few hours you pretty much drive across the field desperately trying to hit the ball. And you fail ... Hard ....... Many, MANY times, but you laugh at your fails and at all the other players' fails too.After a while you can get decent shots with the ball and you start to take the game more seriously. But what makes you really angry are the guys that can shoot from up in the air, which you think is very unfair.So now you also want to become one of those flying monsters and you're going to have a really hard time trying to hit those aerials until you can finally wreck your opponents.Did I say finally? Well, No Way! Now it is all about actually shooting the air balls on target from right underneath the ceiling and off the walls and stuff...Uh, are we still not the biggest pro in the world now? The answer is a big fat NO! There are still many more things to learn pushing your skill to maximum and beyond ... and on ... and on .... and even further.This experience is also pushed by a pretty good matchmaking system that (almost) always puts you into challenging matchups no matter what skill level you are at.Rocket League really is a great game and if you consider to buy it, just go for it - a decision you won't regret. While being a little sceptic about the initial hype with nearly every streamer or youtuber playing the game, I have to admit what Psyonix delivers to us here justifies all attention and excitement about the game.10/10"

Fun, addictive and skillbased.Best played with a controller IMO.Some people complain about a toxic community. I haven't encountered much of that but I rarely play ranked. As when playing any real life sport this game makes you feel that tension, hope to do better and small annoyance whenever your opposition outplays you. Still; 95% of all people I played against were good sports and took it with a smile whether winning or losing.I mostly played 3v3 and 4v4 and feel that there is where the game truly shines. When a team works together on positioning and helping eachother, complement eachother so to say, is where the game goes from good to the best sports-like game I've ever played.This game makes that football/soccer feeling more present than any Fifa game ever has so far. Hitboxes and physics are precise and a joy to behold when you interprete the ball's path and your angle on impact right.This is one of those games that set new standards IMO. Already to be considered a classic and a worthy one of that title. You owe it to yourself to try it to see what sport games can be like in the future. More precise, more tense, more fun, more sports.This is  a great game. Try it out! (and get a refund if it's not up your alley but atleast try it to see what it is)."

Rocket league is just perfect in every way shape and form. There's something about it that makes me keep coming back for more every single day. The strive to be great at the game is so oddly compelling and truly satisfactory when you actually see yourself improving.Losing in this game doesn't hurt as bad as other games such as league/hearthstone. There is almost no luck in this game. You look at what you did wrong every time and start remembering. Predicting where the ball will go next and where you need to be next to get that shot or save.Playing together with friends in a party is probably the most fun I have ever had playing a game and with the new mutators/dlc this is only the beginning of the fun.This game will turn you into a teenage girl before a house party. You're going to go through so many different styles of dresses and the dlc only makes it worse. The endless combinations of cars/decals/paint/hats/trails is a lot of fun for finding what you like best. I personally suggest playing with all of the cars until you find your favorite. I use the Dominus from the Battlecars dlc and have never switched to another since.Bottom lineIf your looking for a game that has so much potential for your skill to grow, Love to play with friends or by yourself, and like to customize your playing experience, then do yourself a favor and buy this ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece."

When you want to have an adrenaline rush big enough to pump you up and have a great time, but small enough to keep you relaxed, this is the game. Unlike, say, CS:GO or StarCraft 2, Rocket League brings the best of both worlds: casual and competitive play, and blends the two together to give you the most fun possible. The skill cap in this game is incredibly high, and you can never stop learning and getting better.It's fun to play, it's fun to watch, and also it's fun to fool around in additional modes (currently there are basketball and hockey variations, along with Rocket Labs, game mode with custom, funnily twisted maps.) Oh, and did I mention how much fun it is to customize your car? It's crazy. Pick a model, paint it in different patterns, pick the wheels, boost pattern, add a hat, an antenna (or don't), and you can roll around in your awesome pirate- or Holy-Religion-Jesus-Something-themed vehicle.You can really feel the speed of your car, and the adrenaline kick is enough for a dopamine rush compared to getting high on chocolate-flavour after-workout pizza weed straight from the best weed plantation on the face of the earth.Buy it if you want to lose your 15 hours from your week, every week. If you only want to lose 5 minutes of your day, every day, still buy it, since this is the length of an average match. But be warned: you're going to quickly develop the ""one more game"" syndrome (if you haven't yet.) You have been warned.But seriously, buy it."

Nonono you WILL at least play 4 matches until it even crosses your mind to quit again, you maybe think that 100+ Hours are not much in a Game and i would give you right there, but then i need to remind you that 1 match only takes about 5-6 minutes. so yeah, 100+ Hours is a good time in my opinion.Quick Review over the importances to say about this Game:-basically football without human players, just cars-matches that take about 5-6 minutes each-crate system maybe a little too similiar to CS:GO-1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4s in many different gamemodesGamemodes-Normal 1v1,2v2 etc. as you see everywhere-1v1,2v2 etc. in a ranked system-Rumble is basically normal 3v3 with powerups to♥♥♥♥♥♥each other off, great variety and great fun-Hockey, well its hockey, what did you expect. ball is a puck and the floor is ice-Rocket Labs, normal 3v3 just on experimental maps you wont see anywhere else, great fun for trying something new-And the Last ist Basketball, this gamemode isnt too much fun since the maps are abysmaly small but its pretty good for learning how to flyAnd thats basically it, not much right? Well yeah if you look at it that way its really small in Content, however this Game is damn competitive and addicting if you can get into the scenario of car football.If you are still into that then by all means, buy it.thanks for reading through my ramblings :3"

Boy was I wrong. This is in all ways a great game. First off, it's really easy to get into. No crazy rules or anything to memorize, its just one of those games that is easy to pick up but hard to master. Optimization for this game is STELLAR. I was personally expecting my build to run it terribly as it runs most other games pretty bad but I was happily surprised to find this game to run smooth as butter. There are also a ton of customization options, a decent amount to start off with and more are unlocked through playing matches. Controls feel fluid and ""right"". What I mean by that is a lot of games these days the controls just feel off and ehh. I was playing with a PS4 controller and it works flawlessly and the controls are great although the default sensitivity I found to be a bit low so I had to adjust that. My main problem I have with this game is the matchmaking system. Honestly it's not great as beginners will be paired up with pros which is a pain so expect your first few hours in the game to be an absolute wreck. Another thing I have to say I don't like about this game it would be the maps. Don't get me wrong they are all really pretty but all the maps are essentially just different backgrounds of the same pill shaped stadium. It would be cool if different maps had certain features to them that made them for unique (like ramps in different parts of the maps). Other than that this is definitely a must buy, i'm really sad I hadn't tried this out sooner."

With an incredibly well realised visual aesthetic and presentation that oozes class. It's money well spent even if you're just playing on-line alone.

Essentially a soccer game where you drive a car to bump a giant soccer ball around, Rocket League has plenty of epic saves and amazing goals that keep you coming back for more. There is even a ranking system plus a competitive matchmaking mode for those who want to test their mettle against similarly skilled players.Psyonix has also pledged to not introduce powerups or any changes to game balance, which is fantastic as all the cars handle the same essentially. I've heard rumors that some of the hitboxes and handling are slightly different between cars, but it is negligible at best. I've missed these kinds of games, where there are no silly ""perks"" a la Call of Duty or car customization that can give you an edge in any way. It's just you, your car, and the ball. The new DLC cars are mostly novelties and haven't given an edge to any particular model of car, which is fantastic.I've been following this game for quite some time so I bought it almost instantly when it was released. I highly recommend you pick it up if you're a fan of competitive sports games. Seeing as it's been top seller on steam for a couple weeks now, I'm sure this game will continue to have a healthy, active community for a long, long time."

I saved up and scouted the house for the remaining money I needed to buy the game. Finally, I was able to afford the game. When I bought the game, I wasn't disappointed. I spenthoursplaying this game. Before I even knew it, I was at 100 hours, then 200, then 300 and so on..If anyone is considering or on the edge of buying this game, buy it. This game has stood the test of time and is still one of the top games on the steam store, and it has sold over 5 million copies. While some people may think the physics of the game are off, and some of the cars are ""interesting"" looking, I can assure you that after playing this game for over 600 hours, this game has stuck with me and even pushed out some other games.I love this game because of the impact of teamwork throughout the game, you have to work with other in order to win, (unless you are playing Solo Duel) and it brings friends together. I found some great friends while playing matches and ended up playing with them more. Once in a while, a teammate would not be quite the skill level of the other players in the matches, and sometimes you will be put in that situation as well, but as long as you work together beautifully with your teammate, you could win, even against the toughest matches. In my case, this would be the time when I was playing with one of my friends and were pitted against aSeason 2 Grand Champion(a very good player for those who do not know) and on top of that aRocketeer(the top level rank you can receive, Level 75), while I was and my teammate were mere veterans. We ended up winning that match. We were so excited that we managed to be such high levels.My recommendation for everyone, before this turns into an essay, please do buy this game. It has such a small price for what it could be compared to other games. Psyonix has always had a mindset of a non-pay-to-win game, and they have completed that in Rocket League, with only cars and crate keys that you can buy with real money. No one has a higher advantage over another player, just because they have more money. And even with that, some of the money that was put into their esports prize pools, to the players, to the community. The constant updates add new maps, cars and decals, and they do not change the main essence to the game.I have loved this game from day one and will continue playing this game. If you also agree, vote this game for any of the awards you think it deserves. I believe this game deserves more recognition than it already gets."

It's essentially soccer, and it only takes a quick glance at the gameplay to realize that. You can hand someone the controller, and it instantly clicks.But you can learn new techniques after 10 hours of playing. The same can be said after 20 hours. Even after 100 hours, players can still learn new skills, and eventually dunk a wall aerial into the upper 90.Don't get ahead of yourself, though. It takes a lot of wins, losses, blown leads and comebacks to get into the higher level of play.Under all this strategy and technique, Rocket League is all about finding fun within competition. There's no feeling quite like shocking the rest of the players on the pitch when you crush a lightning pass with an aerial barrel roll. So hit the pitch, practice, make some friends and surprise yourself with what you can do in Rocket League."

I've put in over 400 hours now and it's easy to say that you never stop learning of new things to do. That's the magic of this game. If you have the drive to become better, you have that opportunity. Every game is a fresh pallette for your to learn from. Engaging in aerials and challenging the ground play is commonplace for even ""fresh"" under 100 hour players now. It's remarkable how the community has grown.The basis of the game itself is the player base. You can focus on the inevitable sketchy personalities there are, or you can play and find those worth spending your cooperative playtime with. I've always been interested in learning from others and it's been great playing with 30+ good teammates along the way. If you're the type that wants to push yourself and get better personally, this game is absolutely for you. The ball physics do become more predictable and make sense as you pay attention and see the trends. Player personalities do show through and your study of the behaviors does matter. The game is far from surface-deep.Original post Jul 17, 2015:  This game transports me back to the feeling of all the great old-school sports games. I remember yelling at my friends every time the game winning shot went and we whined over the indefinite ball physics. That isn't to say that this game isn't polished. It has a nice energetic electronic soundtrack and it doesn't try to inject excessive personality. The elements it has are well done. Some examples...-Graphics: not too cartoony, not overly gritty.-Venues: although little variance, lots of ambient and lighting differences keeps things fresh.-Customization: Make your car your own with a rich color pallette and some neat effects.Bought this at regular price, it is totally worth it!

Ranging from raw basic mechanical skill, to dribbling, aerials, positionioning and so on the games are always exciting and there is always something new to learn and improve.Even if the game was just the so called ""Soccar"" it would already be perfect.1v1s, 2v2s, 3v3s and the casual chaotic 4v4 all are play very diferently, even if it's just the amount of players that is changing.The devs, however, keep adding free casual modes (Mutators for private matches, Dropshot, Rumble [Mario Kart style gameplay with power ups], Hoops [It's own version of basketball with cars], and even Hockey. Like Soccar, every game mode plays and feels diferently.Psyonix is also doing an amazing job in pushing the competitive scene with the RLCS and other big tournaments are just in the horizon for Rocket League (Dreamhack here we go).If you want an online game that is competitive and it's very rewarding to both play and master it RL is the game for you.If you want to play it casualy and without pressure, Psyonix also got you covered with awesome casual and party modes.PS.: with the Switch release coming soon theres a bright future for Rocket League and Its community."

Different cars have different physics (only minor and really slight changes to its handling and hitboxes. Yes, you can buy different cars with the DLC's and yes you might have some advantage doing so, but in my whole experience with the game I only ONCE had the feeling, that another car might have changed a single shot in one game. There is actually a top list of all cars in the game and the free cars are rocking the top 3 spots - i think this is enough to prove that this game isnt a pay-to-win. The other car costumisations are just optical, but you can pimp yo ride together and have a ""firefighter"" team, just like me and my mates.Matchmaking in this game works really well and you barely get any players, that are way above or below your skill group.This said, ranking up feels really satisfying and you feel like you deserved it. Same goes for deranking of course. I've had some really fun times with friends when I was playing casually, but sometimes you just wanna win some games and it just feels so good, when you win a game after a long overtime with a well placed aerial shot.Speaking of that, this game has a really high learning curve and the skill ceiling is pretty much non-existent. You can always improve on stuff like aerials, game sense and goalkeeping.The only thing I can recommend to improve is to paly games and have a fixed teammate. This helped me a lot.Now to the points I  dislike about this game. The community.... Sometimes youre lucky and noone in the entire game uses the quick chat ""OMG"". It doesnt really matter if ""This Guy"" is on your team or the other, he will still ruin the game for all the others. There is the option to mute him, but it still is sad, that this beauty of a game is ruined by kids.In the recent updates the developers added in some really interesting things like experimental maps, new gamemodes and ranked seasons to make things more interesting. I think this is an important factor for the game. We've all heard about those developers that release their game and just abandon it because they already got their money. I really wish there was some kind of workshop inplementation for costum maps, but since this game is multi-platform this is a problem for the playstation folks.Rocket League is a possibly competetive ""racing-football (soccer)- team-based game in which the better player is often rewarded with the well deserved victory. This means that luck is a factor, but a good player can change his playstyle accordingly to counter this luck factor."

,Recommended,252950,19157775,"Posted: 19 November, 2015",all,Wertysd,"Rocket Leaguehas a simple concept, hitting a huge sized ball to a goal using rocket boosted cars. It's easy to get into, but the skill ceiling allows you to keep learning and getting better after every single play session.  That happens to be one of the most addicting parts of the game for me, always feeling like improving.The game can currently be played from 1v1 to 3v3 as ranked and 4v4 and Mutator Mashup as unranked/casual variations. Mutator Mashup being mixes of different game settings, affecting for instance ball size. Allowing you to play with a huge sized cubical ball in a low gravity field etc. Not forgetting, Rocket League also has a number of different styles to play against bots. Their difficulty goes fromthem putting the ball in their own goalto them beingsurprisingly hard to play against.If you happen to be the first one of your friend group trying to decide whether to buy it or not, it can be perfectly played alone. Having friends of course making it easier to communicate, other than a few commands e.g. ""Defending"",""I got it"" etc. On a final note,you should really own a controller, as the game plays a lot better using a controller in my opinion. Althought the buttons can be rebinded on both keyboard and controller.Pros:It plays against other players, so there's no endBig player base, finding games fastThe graphics are really pleasing AND it's well optimizedAlways room to improve your skillsCons:May require a controller in order to get the most out of it"

The matchmaking is easy to jump into for some instant action on dedicated servers, and a simple party system makes it easy to play with friends online or split-screen. The game play is quick to pick up but there are so many nuanced techniques to master that it is suitable for a wide variety of players both casual and competitive. It's also visually stunning and runs great, but the graphics are just an extra treat, the real substance is a game that leaves you wanting more and more after every match.

At least, it doesn't hurt since they're committed to not fiddling and tweaking and throwing in gimmicks to the core modes. Most choices are cosmetic and what counts is how you play. No pay to win! How about that?So hop in and bop the ball around with others at your skill level! And when you get up to the point where people are flying off the walls and knocking the ball into your goal from midair, rest assured it's not because they bought fancy gear or gained enough levels to give them perks.

When you played the round when you won or lost you get new items or a new car. You can customize your your car boost engine to for an example: snowflakes, sparkles and much more... You can customize your tires of the car and your antenna which can have your country on or other things like skull, heart, snowman and more... You can even put on the head of car for an example: a crown, taxi lighter and more...You can choose which color of the car you want. On the blue is green or blue or mixed, on the red its red or yellow or mixed together.From level 1-10 your ROOKIE, from level 10-20 your SEMI-PRO, from level 20-30 your PRO, from 30-40 your VETERAN, from 40-50 your EXPERT, from 50-60 your MASTER. And that means each time your level goes higher you will face more skilled player from multiplayer.The gameplay is simple, hit the ball in the goal, when your ingame you can pickup a small or big yellow things on the field which give you boost, with boost you can get fater to the goal before other enemy team shoot on it. But if your teammate shoots the ball almost to the goal, use the boost and go fast and shoot on the goal and win.My rate: 11/10Just like jacksepticeye said: SPEED IS KEEEEY!!!!EDIT: I love the new updates and DLCs, it makes you wanna play even more and im playing it since I did this whole review.

I knew it would be good based on gameplay I'd seen and seeing the features it has. I was worried I'd get addicted, and I am. Bought it. Too late to turn back. Worth it.Visually, the game looks great. The particle effects, the stadiums, awesome job. You really get immersed into everything.The controls are very easy. Right now I'm using a mouse and keyboard. After a few hours straight of playing, my W, A, S, D fingers were sore (lots of movement in this game). I plan on trying the game out with a controller (which seems to be the popular way to go).Like other reviews say, it's a breeze to pick up but hard to master. But so far in only 3 hours of playing, I would say I can hold my own quite well. Been matched up against pros (there's ranks that will appear under names such as Rookie, Semi-Pro, Pro (I think it goes higher)) and I've been able to outmaneuver them. The game takes some patience. Setting up shots for your teammates, waiting for the right time to thrust in and hit the ball; not just driving crazy and hitting the ball just to hit it. If you're worried about how you play, there's tutorials and training you can go through. I haven't done any of that (I'd rather learn by diving straight into a match) and I turned out fine. But there's lots of help if you want to get better.As far as the DLC, I haven't bought any, but they look neat. The cosmetics and car types are very appealing and bring a fun element to the game. I have several thousand hours in TF2, so maybe I'm biased :P And you acquire some after matches, it's not like you have to go in and buy stuff, that's just the DLC that costs money. Everything else you get by playing the game, which I love.I highly recommend this game. You don't have to like cars or soccer to play this. It's just fun."

Awesome maps, and has a competitive part to it, where you can play ranked matches. It also has cross-platform multiplayer, which is something R* should do with GTA Online. You can play with your friends if they're on PS4 or X1 and you're on the master race. Valve should take a look at RL and see how servers should be.

Rocket League is the sequel to that game- arcade football with RC cars.If that sounds simple, that's because it is. However, as many players of the original found out, it's deceptively simple. While the controls and the aim of the game are easy to pick up, there's definitely a big gap between a good player and a bad player; mastering the physics of the ball and your own car take a long time.Rocket League is a step up from the original in nearly every single way. The game looks gorgeous, has a great soundtrack and the customisable options are off the charts.

I bought it by saying If so we play together and enjoy so I have no regret. We can consider this game ""haxball in the third dimension"". That's because They two are the games which looks like easy while watching but after playing, you realise that you cant do what you think in.There is not so many words to say about the game, since it has no story or something like that. To get used to play is crucial and I dont think that you dont need any skill when you play. You memorize the ball physics by training after a while. If you learn to set the kicking ball timing, the rest is about luckiness. There is something called aerial kick that I can't do well and think it is the only hard thing in this game. It might be de done by training and playing but somehow I cant. Though, I dont really play so much. I play 2-3 games in 4-5 days.In short, I suggest you to buy this game. You won't regret but It starts boring you after 2-3 games."

I've been playing the game on and off since its launch and it has been quite interesting to see its evolution. At first, most of the newcomers who hadn't played in the beta or the previous title were quite terrible and that included me too. We were content with just hitting the ball, then we learned hitting the ball effectively with boost and flips. It took longer but we reached the skies eventually, learning to control the vehicles in mid-air and scoring aerial goals.It's not just a game of skill, it requires quite a bit of thinking and mental awareness. You need to be aware of where the ball is, where it will go to and how it might bounce, but then you  also need to be aware of your opponents, your teammates, what they might do and if they're capable of doing it. It doesn't hurt to know what you can pull off as well.Overall, I've found Rocket League engaging enough to play for 450+ hours and I don't regret it. Even though the game can sometimes make you rage, the core mechanics are so solid that you will likely return once it has had a chance hook you."

I would recommend Bad Rats instead if you have the change, but this is a starter game to get you into the strategy game genre of games. I would say Europa Universalis 4 would be the next game you pick up after this one and you'd already know some of the basics of the game. I was disapointed though when I couldn't change my car to green and for that I will have to take off one point. Also I lost a match and they should recall this game because its not fair that the guy I'm playing is better than me. I also found this game a bit racist because your car can't be black so it is promoting racism to younger audiences. I can predict that this game will be on the news in the future and did you know that Dylann Storm Roof shot up that one church because of the racism depicted in Rocket League? This game will cause many more black shootings in the future and eventually cause a massive worldwide race war that will leave whites victorious and over 4 billion people dead. This new white regime will be the 4th reich and will reign for thousands of years prosperously in a never ending golden age. Rocket League is responsible for this atrocity and everyone worldwide will pray to the Rocket League god ( Van Merc ) the best car because it has more mass. Everything is pretty cool and chill in this world ruling civilization unless you are not white. The one downside is that if you are caught playing any other game you will be put to death a sacrificed to Van Merc to satisfy his quench for blood. Rebels in the 4th reich regime formed together to start planning to overthrow the 4th reich Van Merc regime so their god ( Bad Rat ) can reign as the world leader. But to take over the 4th reich they will have to get the gang back together. First they went for vacuum rat because he would be the easiest to find. They found him cleaning houses in his new vacuum company. Then they got cannon rat and bulldozer rat. The two rats were now construction workers and they used to be called the dynamic duo. The last and hardest rat to find was fat rat and he was so hard to find because he was trapped in a sandwich. ( classic fat rat ) Now that the gang was back together they now had to challenge Van Merc to a game in Rocket League. Van Merc gladly accepted because he has never been defeated before because he has more mass. The rats would have to pull out all the tricks in the book if they wanted to win this one. The rats unknowingly have been training for this game their entire life from killing countless cats and were ready. It was game day and skins were bet on Van Merc 10000000 to 1. No one thought the Bad Rats gang could do it but they could. Some things happen, fat rat falls over a few times, but the bad rats gang were victorious! The 4th reich Van Merc regime fell and every person was allowed to live and you could play any game. IGN hailed Bad rats as a classic and fat rat was the new god that everyone prayed to. and they lived happily ever after. the endoverall 6/10"

Each round is set to5 minutes, if the score is set to draw at the endof the clock, you go to overtime, and the first teamto score wins.Might not sound that fun, neither thought I whenI first saw this game popping up at Steam.But when I started playing it, it was a whole differentthing. This game is freaking addictive, fun and competitive,and just blew me away.Rocket League is developed by Psyonix. Not the mostknown developer team, but they do have some experience,mainly developing Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Carson Ps3 and Co-Developing Unreal Tournament 2004 with Epic Games.And that shows, as the core mechanics are tight and precise.The Nitro-cars can use boostersyou fill up by driving over glowing circles around the field,you can double-jump and do trick-shots, and it's sosatisfying to score goals, doing that one insane trick-jump thatjust manages to nudge that ball into the goal, then watch the gloryin replay. Teamplay is important in this game,having a team mate passing the ball just right so you canboost in and do a trick-jump and score.The game is also fair, as there's no bs perks or unlockableitems that can give you an advantage in the match.The unlockables are straight visual changes, as well as the cars youunlock throughout the game. So everyone is playing onequal terms, and it's skills and team play that will determinethe winner.You can either play against Bots in customs matches,or seasons mode where you'll play in a leaguespanning over a set number of weeks.The bots are pretty good at Pro difficulty.At rookie they're too easy and dumb, so playingat Pro is the sweet spot between useless andunfair.If you're after some more intellectual opponents,head over to the multiplayer.This game supports 2, 3 and 4 player split-screenfor playing with friends.If split-screen ain't your cup of tea, no problem,this game features Match Making and Dedicated Servers.Set up a private lobby with your friends or play againstrandom people. This game features 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3 and 4vs4matches.Currently this game has a pretty large player-base for an indie game,and that's thanks to Cross-Platform play between PC and Ps4.The graphics are splendid, colourful and visually exciting, so nothingto complain about here.I really don't have much of any complaints regarding this game,tho some might feel as there's little content in this game,with there only being one game modeand no performance-enchanting upgrades for your cars, but,in my opinion, that's what makes this game great, everyone isplaying on equal terms, and the core mechanics in my opinion,is so fun and addictive that it doesn't really need more gamemodes to satisfy me.If you're a person who appreciates these types of games, this onemight be perfect for you, either you just want to casually playalone or with friends, or take it up to a competitive level, this gamejust works, and will give me many many hours of funentertainment.I strongly recommend this game for anyone wanting to trysomething different and looking for either casual funor competitive play either against bots or online.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more reviews and recommendations, please visithttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6966222-Bad-English-Game-Reviews/"

It's a very relaxing game, and it's a good choice for me to have a rest when I'm tired about ohter games. I'll never be tired of this creative game.But here comes a terrible news, this game had been introduced to China. Yes, you may think that I ought to be happy because I'm a Chinese player as well as living in China. But on the contrary, the agent in China is Tencent, it's a very famous game company but also with a lot of awful history. Moreover, recently Tencent wanted to popularize a game platform call ""TGP"", to make it like a Chinese Steam. And not long ago, TGP had intorduced Stardew Valley to China and had converted it into Chinese. So problems arisen. TGP(Tencent) did not chinesize the game themself, they just copied the code, the patch which were chinesized by other inofficial workers without authorization and permission. They wouldn't not pay for their thievery, and those workers could not get the help as well.no laws and economic capabilityBesides, Tencent had done many sick things. Let take Monster Hunter OnLine as an instance, in addition to make profits, they had opened ""closed test"" several times(yum-yum, for the information I searched online, it had ""closed test"" for nearly three years). And ever time the test opened, they would sale the invitation codes as a part of their profits. And meanwhile, they would sale props such as StaminAidDrug, sale appearance to players, and the only way you could get it was to purchase them by money.(not the coins in game, but in reality)They made it like a offical  version, but actually it was one time of the ""colsed test"".Not only the MHOL like what I said above, Blade and Soul, The Magic Blade(a game produced by Tencent themself) had all suffered this conditon. And when the game released officially, they had made enough profits and then let the game half-dead.So, I truly appreciate the developer brought this game to Chinese distrct, but I do not wish the agent are Tencent(TGP). I don't know what will happen before long, maybe charge a lot of money, or maybe change the data, or maybe release a car with Chinese characteristics and charge a barrel of moneyyes, Tencent had done this before. They created a powerful prop and charged it for 998 RMB(nearly 140 Dollar), or maybe nothing. But I think many players also do not want to see Tencent(TGP) to introduce this game to China.At last, I have to give the developer, not the game, a negative conmment."

The concept of the game is simple and very enjoyable. Even though they reccomend you to play with a controller, I found that the keyboard and mouse controls were easy to use so I did'nt bothered playing with a controller. There are ALOT of car customisation so you can make your own car look unique and unlock more items as you level up. Multiplayer is fun. There is a casual mode where you play for fun in 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4. And if you are a competitive person there is a ranked mode where you can play 1v1 2v2 and 3v3. Single player consists of quickmatch with the A.I or local and a season mode. Season mode is well detailed, you can choose your team, how many players per team, how long the season will be and more. Also you can adjust difficulty as you play. There is something for everyone in this game. For a 21$ game it looks amazing the details on the grass and the environment is amazing and it runs smoothly.

Rocket League puts you in the shoes of one of these vehicles as you do your best to try and put that stupid god damn ball into the stupid god damn net if only your god damn team would stop charging at the god damn ball like you're part of a god damn peewee soccer team.God damn.Never has a game made me feel as inadequate as Rocket League, it's like living in a box while Tommy Two Tooth lives in a relatively clean dumpster. I want that dumpster, Tommy.The game can be played with anything from two to eight people, who's objective is to hit the giant ball into the giant net. This is easier said than done half the time since you have 6 or 8 people charging into the ball with the hope of it somehow finding the net. I mean, I'm guilty of this two, but I have the excuse of being ripped on MDMA for most of my life.Sounds simple, right? Well, it is, but it also mixes in a few other elements. Not only does your car move fairly fast, but it also comes with a turbo feature so you can haphazardly drive up the wall and fly off the ceiling. You can also double jump to reach a high flying ball and miss completely. One of the more advanced techniques is to use the turbo boost mid air so you can fly of sorts and miss the  ball while it's still in the air. My favorite feature is hitting the ball and having it accidentally fly into my own net, having my friends laugh and yell at me while I wonder why I'm sober.Haha, just kidding. I don't have friends.Missile Franchise however has one major advantage. And that's how easy it is to pick up. You can go weeks, if not months of not playing and still be fairly awful as you were while you still played. It's hard to take a game like Rocket League seriously and that's probably it's strongest point, mixing in both casual and hardcore players and showing that we're both equally garbage.Should you play Rocket League?I say you should, it's fun, fast, and frantic, it's great to play with others, and it also lets you destroy little kids to the point that they make high pitch noises and Pikachu sounds for the rest of the game until they quit.Seriously, I'm not joking, we did that once, we broke him.Projectile Tournament gets 8 cars flying aimlessly through the air out of 10.The curator:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation"

In this day and age the publishers that be think that template EULAs should be used on all platforms.Publishers,The EULA, that was added on 2016/09/08, states thatI (the consumer) cannot use the license on more than one PC even though I own a license to use it on the PC platform. Compare section 2(1) against section 5.1.b.  In otherwords you are trying to make the license be bound to 1 computer.  Section 2(1) makes sense in that I have a license on/with a single platform.  But section 5.1.b does NOT make sense in this day and age.  Espectially when the distribution platform is Steam.  Steam controls/limits only 1 active/running game at a time. AND when the game is paired with Steam Cloud which easily migrates saves between one computer and another I cannot believe that you added section 5.1.b.*#2) is that a EULA was added POST-SALE. I was not presented with a EULA at the time of sale therefor one CANNOT be added after the fact especially when it bans my use of the software if I don't agree to the license. e.g. I should not be able to use the newly patched version but I should be able to use the version prior to the patch that added the EULA in-game. Also I have no recourse, on the Steam platform, to use the previous version that did not require the EULA. (Steam's backup system doesn't work like a traditional backup system.)#3) Also Psyonix in section 6(7) says they can decide if your account loses access to VC/VG with no mention of any recourse the consumer can take to refute the claim. e.g. they are the police, judge and executioner.#4) Lastly Psyonix is specifically removing a right Californian's have. See the bottom of section 8. Thus this cannot be good for the consumer if they are removing a consumer right.All in all this was a bad move by Psyonix. It is a bait and switch licensing in terms of #2. You cannot even exit the software without agreeing to the license (unless you use Task Manager. You cannot even use Windows' ALT-F4). That seems a bit illegal doesn't it?*Post updated on 2016/09/09 0207 because I re-read the EULA and it indeed says 'at the same time'  I swear it wasn't there the 1st time I read it.  I apologize."

Despite the negative review I will swallow my opinions and keep playing but that doesn't mean that the game is going to right direction.The latest updates have only been about removing important things from the game and adding pointless content such as gazillion stupid toppers and stuff that can be bought in crates.Some examples of this:There used to be a few maps that differed from the usual and actually made a slight change into the highly repetitive gameplay. The community couldn't handle this and kept crying about it until those maps were removed from competitive games (and the best of these maps, Neo-Tokyo was even removed from casual). Another map, Starbase Arc, was added in the same update. It was also a no go for people because using a few extra brain cells to play in a hexagon is not possible, and Psyonix removed that in the next update.The cars in the game have felt quite balanced but it's obvious that there are a few choices over others, Octane and Batmobile, as no other car is ever seen in high level competitive games like RLCS. What does Psyonix do for this ""issue""? Standardize all cars into a few hitbox models so you won't accidentally find some variation to your gaming.All of this ""dumbing down"" to focus on esports is making the game just boring. Back in the day you could have every 5th match in an arena that forced you play differently and have some variation, now you can grind 8 hours and see the same damn map over and over again while playing with cars that all feel the same.And if being offended by getting features removed from the game wasn't enough, there is always the toxic community to help if your day was too good. It can't even be explained, you have to experience it. And after that you never ever want to experience something like that again."

,Recommended,252950,17255024,"Posted: 27 July, 2015",all,Mr Thy,"Football (soccer for the US people out there) with cars. Cars that can jump, flip and even fly. The game is the definition of ""easy to learn, hard to master"". And it's deceptively addictive.It's recommended to at least follow the tutorials to see what the cars are capable of, but after that you can jump right into it, either in offline exhibition matches, a full season, or online (which, by the way, is crossplatform with PS4 users).Teams consist of 1 to 4 players, and last 5 minutes. Should the 5 minutes end in a draw, the game enters sudden death mode, where the next goal decides the winner.There are different cars to choose from, but each car behaves exactly the same, except for the hitbox (the ball bounces off differently).It's a competitive game by nature, so in the end you'll need to master techniques like ball control, flipping and flying to be able to stand a chance later on. Management of your turbo boost is key to this. The boost is limited (but can be replenished by driving over specific spots in the field). Besides to get somewhere fast in emergency situations, boost is also used to make your car fly. By flying you can defend and score goals while the ball is in the air. This gives you a certain advantage compared to people that don't master this skill, because they will be stuck to the ground most of the time, and they will have to wait for the ball to get back down.The only downsides to the game are that it sometimes randomly crashes. Tinkering with graphics settings solves this for some people.Some online games have a bug where some players are invisible.Being a competitive game, be prepared to face some egotistical players in public servers. Everyone rushing to the ball leaving your own goal wide open, stealing goals or even ramming into teammates on purpose. Once you find some nice friends to play with, the game can be incredibly fun.Definitely recommended 8/10"

The game looks good, controls are precise and can be a lot fo fun.Two problems, one, theres just the basic football mode, nothing else. There could be different shaped arena's for different game modes. The secound problem is the AI, they just make a b-line for the ball. And AI in your own team is the same, you could have possesion of the ball but one of your team may just drive into the ball and take it away from you, this becoms very frustrating when a member of your own team will just drive the ball into the net. This has maybe only happened twice though in the 6 hours I've played so it's not a big deal.I would thoroughly recommend this game, it'd be a sin not to buy it."

But for people who just want to have a little fun one late night can pick it up with a friend or two, and suddenly it's so much better. I'll point out a few pros and cons about it (that I know of, and personally think is good/bad) because a lot of people think this is the best♥♥♥♥♥♥ever. It is not. There are many games better than this. But anyway.. What this game has to offer is:-Good soundtrack.Of course not all the songs appeal to me, but most of them do, and you can just have them in the background while working on something else. IF you buy the soundtrack that is. Not all the songs are available though.-A lot of car customizations.Even without the very neat DLCs, you can still get exclusive holiday items, if you're up to farm them, which can be a little time consuming. But other than that, all the cars look good, and you can have a lot of cool and goofy styles, if that's your preference.-It's pretty-looking.Honestly, it's one of the prettiest games I've seen (imo), and I play it on the lowest of the lowest quality. I still see the beauty in the maps and how well done some of them are made.-It's fast paced.Now, some people aren't as good with fast paced games, which is why I'm mentioning it. I love me some fast games, but I'm not really sure if this is a pro or a con. It can be discussed.Now, because I've already given the pros, right up there.^ I dunno what else to put in. It's a fun game and a great experience with friends? idfkWell, the only cons I can think of right off the bat is:-The matchmaking system.Some would agree with me, some would be like ""BUH SUM PPL HEF ROOKI/VETEREN FRENDS THO"". Well y'know what? It's still trash. Honestly. I shouldn't be in a match versus a Veteran when I'm still a Pro. Same with Semi-pro honestly. Yes, the ranks doesn't mean too much, but it can get people on the nerves when they always get a bad team and the other team's much better. Etc. Etc.-It's a sports game.Even though it's not exactly like football (football with cars, wow) it's still football. For those who don't like sports game, or sports in general (except for e-sports) should avoid this. Unless you want to try out something new, that's up to you.-Hitting your own teammates.Yeahm you can hit your own teammates without any consequences, right? Except you can ♥♥♥♥ their position up and lose a point. That's just one example out of many. But I can see how it can be (a little bit) good too. You can hit your teammate in case they got no boost. But usually it just messes up their position.-Easy leveling up.Even though it might not seem like a big deal (levels don't matter) it messes up the matchmaking system, because some Pros and Veterans should play with a lower rank. Again, this can be discussed.Well, I dunno what else to add. For people who don't get the ranking system:- Rookie is the lowest rank, and the first one you'll get. (Level 1-9)- Semi-pro is a rank you get after reaching a certain level. (10-19)- Pro is another rank you'll get after reaching a certain level. (20-29)- Veteran is yet another rank you can get. (30-39)- I'm unsure of the rest of the ranks, but I'm sure there are at least two more. I'm terribly sorry!If I had to rate it though, it'd be 8.5/10. Yeah yeah, sue me, I'm just a human."

I have zero interest in either but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is this game ever fun.The controls are smooth and responsive. You feel like you have total control of your car while you are rocket boosting through the air and drifting through the field. There are plenty of customization options for your vehicles; from different types of boosts, rims, car models, paint jobs and decals, antennas and of course, hats! All of these items are purely cosmetic and don't effect overall gameplay which makes the game even better. Leaving out cars and items with different stats makes the competitiveness of the game a lot more fun when it all comes down to skill when everyone is on equal footing. Teaming up with friends and setting up big plays is an absolute blast. Winning a game feels rewarding and amazing while losing really makes you beat yourself up knowing you got outplayed. The game does a pretty good job at matchmaking people who are the same skill level as you based on your rank.So far there is only one game mode (..and I kinda hope they keep it that way) with the option of playing; 1 v 1, 2 v 2, 3 v 3, and 4 v 4, with 4 v 4 being the only mode that doesn't have a ranked option. The best feature about the game personally is the local 4 player co-op. Playing in the same room with friends is a blast and one of the best party games, even if there is a competitive aspect to the game. The soundtrack in this game is amazing trance mostly created by Mike Ault and Hollywood Principle. I could sit at the main menu and listen to the soundtrack for hours it's that good.What it comes down to is Rocket League is just pure fun and I would recommend this game to anyone."

Unreal engine 4 makes this game an absolute joy to look at while also still being relatively easy to run. The texture quality is gorgeous, down to every last car and stadium. The environments are quite amazing to look at, they do a great job of immersing you in the match. Combine that with the sound design of the cars and the crowds, and you actually start to think you are inside of the arena driving the car. This game also has some of the best particle effects I’ve seen in a game. Every spark, every engine trail effect, and there are a lot of them, just look amazing. This is easily the best looking game I’ve seen this year, and definitely up there for best looking games I’ve ever seen.CONTENTRocket League has enough content to keep entertained for a long, long time. With seemingly endless amounts of ways to customize your car including decals, boost trails, paint colors, types of paint, wheels, HATS, and antennas. Add all of those with a good selection of cars, you can have millions of different combinations. I’ve been playing this game for a long time and I still haven’t unlocked everything in the game. Another great thing this game offers is competent AI to play against. Rookie mode gives you an excellent way to practice at the game, while All-star mode gives a challenge to the experienced Rocket League players. Pick your team in season mode or grab some friends to play online, and be entertained for hours.GAMEPLAYRocket League is a very unique game by nature. There are certainly not a lot of car soccer games, especially not with boost power-ups and jumping cars. Even though there aren’t a lot of games like it, Rocket League nailed their gameplay. It’s an arcade racer at heart, which is perfect for the fast paced action of the game. The cars handle very well, on the ground, gliding on the walls, or in the air.  The gameplay can be very tactical and team based at times. You have to utilize your boost at the right time, you have to make sure you get the right angle on your shots and passes or they will go in every direction but the one you meant. Teamwork is incredibly useful, it’s the difference between winning big and losing big. The gameplay also takes some unique twist when you add or take away players. You can have 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 or even an unfair mode where you play by yourself against multiple AI players. Overall this game is incredible fun to play with friends or by yourself."

I bought it a few days after they did and I am not dissapointed. This game is extremely fun and has hours of competative soccer/car badassery. This game is so fun it makes losing almost an enjoyable experience.Pros:Great single player game playEasy to Party up with friendsFast match quesGreat game mechanics and physicsGreat for all age groupsCons:Takes about 5 to 10 games to get the hang of positioning, boosts, and so forthI wish there were more than 2 different camera angle optionsNo penalty for quitting a gameThe games are 5 minutes and people quitting after being down 2 goals is way to commonNo different game modes (yet)ConclusionGreat game to buy. Its worth every penny. Its one of those games where soring an average goal makes you feel like a boss. Hopefully they add more game types and customizable features. This game exceeded my expectations and I hope that they capitalize on the potential this game has for future development."

,Recommended,252950,19575340,"Posted: 8 December, 2015",all,subZero,"Rocket League must be one of the few games released this year that I can recommend with almost no embarrassment nor awkwardness. So, it's not cringeworthy, then what is it?Rocket League is mostly about having casual fun driving cars with nitrous. The goal in the game is to actually make a goal. With a ball. So, football with cars, 'eh? It might sound a tad lame or somewhat ridiculous idea but trust me. It works, somewhat. The game was made in about couple weeks time by a couple of handless monkeys and an orangutan. You can always get the best out of the game by buying the newest DLC's (read ""cars"") and going nuts with the biggest and baddest hit registers that money can buy. Also, don't forget to tag along your rabbit foot, if you don't know how to play, don't ya worry kid! Just smack the ball as fast as you can, and wait for the goal, it'll go there.As always, the game is ridden with Polish, Russian and other ""bugs"" who like to get busy with your hiney, with a telephone pole. It's not half as bad as CS:GO or DoTA2, but still, very inconvenient for the rest of the world.Pros- Semi-good servers in EU - Oceania - US- Cartoony graphics- Fun to play- Easy to learnCons- Some of the servers lag. A lot.- Matchmaking needs country limitations.- No anti-cheat (first cheats are appearing as you read this)All in all, it's a pretty decent game as long as you play with your friends.3.5/5"

It rewards individual skill, teamwork, and takes a step away from the upgrade systems we're so used to seeing in competitive multi-players. You will not be rewarded with upgrades over time to give you an edge over the competition; however, you will be given cosmetic upgrades as you progress and build your skill at the game. This promotes skill-based, team-focused gameplay and discourages relying on performance upgrades that you truly haven't earned to best your opponent. It's simply one of the most enjoyable multi-player experiences I have ever had. Buy this game. Now. Do it... do it."

Been playing since the first week it came out.Reading through some of the negative reviews, I saw a lot of people saying the game is ""two dimensional"" or ""very shallow."" If you spend most of your time getting angry and playing angry, you'll never be good at this game. You have to analyze your mistakes and learn from them. Watching some videos and seeing how others play definitely helps your game. You'll notice over time how much better you really get.This game isn't all about staying on the ground and doing front flips into the ball. Although it can be frustrating at first, expanding your arsenal to the air, learning new moves and improving on your weaknesses can make this game super fun. Only downside to this game is that you really can't play for more than an hour or two at a time (although I've played longer sometimes) because it can be boring after a little while, but during that hour, it's a hell of a lot of fun.Really recommend playing with friends as well.

It's easy to pick up- you'll start to hit the ball consistently.Here's the thing- this game is stupidly hard to master to the point where you don't even know where's the skill ceiling. And as you're pretty much addicted to it, you have the motivation to consistently practice to improve.This is what makes this game so special. In other sports games you can tap 'pass' or 'shoot' and the computer will do it for you. In RL, things are much harder. The only controls gifted to you are the controls of your car. The freedom to create play is thus unreal, as it is unrestricted by anything. Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense. This is what makes RL so special- it is less of a sports game and more of an actual sport."

,Recommended,252950,25453008,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,Twitch | LeverageL1,"With a total of over 600 hours played I thought it about time to write a review. While this is of course subjective based as is most reviews I hope it provides you with what you are looking for and helps you to decide if you will be purchasing this game.Common thought |Coming from mainly fps and mmo type genres I can't recall a time where I was ever interested in a sport based game in fact I dispised them. I had to be persuaded just like those I have had to persuade before they realise this is a great game that deserves a chance to prove itself. If you are like I was you have probably thrown this game out the window because you think it ""looks boring"" or ""its just soccer with cars"" and thats a shame and my goal is to help you reconsider.Match Length |Each match of Rocket League lasts 5 minutes (Custom games excluded). The match ends when the timer hits 0 and the ball hits the ground or a goal is scored.Game Modes |I will start by explaining the non-competitive (Unranked) game modes. I won't go in depth but hope to provide enough information so you get a rough idea of each one. At the time of writing this review there are 8 modes which include: Duel (1v1), Doubles (2v2), Standard (3v3), Chaos (4v4), Snow day (Ice field with a puck instead of a ball), Rocket Labs (Experimental wierd shaped maps), Hoops (Basketball court with the hoops elevated) and Rumble (A new game mode which gives players power ups every 10 seconds which can effect both the ball and other players).I personally prefer Duels and Doubles as they require more effort on my part. Standard is fine and is the most common in the pro scene however I am not a fan of that many cars on the field at one time and usually stay in goals to avoid the mayhem. 4v4 is just a cluster ♥♥♥♥ and I never play it. Snow day was fun for about 5 minutes but not something I will be going back to. Rocket Labs can be fun for some random games and provides variation from the standard maps. Hoops was also fun for about 5 minutes and I feel the court is to small and should be made larger or even the same size as the soccer field but that might come across as wierd since a basketball court is smaller then a soccer field... anyway I don't play it and won't play it again. Rumble suprised me actually. It's quite fun and its hard to predict what can happen. You opponant may shoot for goal but then the ball is frozen in mid air for a few seconds which is then saved followed by a punch which sends the ball to the other end. I will be going to Rumble when I want some variation to my game from time to time.Competitive |This is where the game gets fun however does have both pros and cons. The competitive (Ranked) game modes include Duel, Doubles, Standard and Solo Standard (3's but you queue by yourself).Ranks - A total of 10 matches are required before you will be placed into a rank. There are 4 tiers which include Prospect (Prospect 1,2,3 & Elite), Challenger (Challenger 1,2,3 & Elite), Star (Rising Star, Shooting Star, All Star & Super Star) Champion (Champion, Super Champion & Grand Champion) Each rank within a tier has 5 divisions. Once you have reached division 5 in that rank you then have a chance to move up 1 rank.PROS:1. Its hard! - Games that are easy are boring, Rocket League is a game that you progressively improve over time and there are always players at your level which means you don't always get owned. When you score a goal or win its satisfying. After 600 hours when I get a goal it still feels awesome.2. Teamwork and Communication - Strategy is definitely something that will improve you game. Pulling off mad plays or passing at the right time then stepping our opponant to score a goal is cool as ♥♥♥♥!CONS:1. sometimes versing unfair opponants where you verse someone greatly better then yourself or a smurf which is incredibly irritating.2. The addition of the Wasteland and Tokyo maps in competitive play. I feel they shouldn't be included as the field is different then the rest of the standard maps. This means some people may get these maps more then others which I feel is unfair. Tokyo being in competitive takes it to another level. The map has elevated sides and is just rediculous. Wasteland and Tokyo should be in non competive only.Final Thought |Look the game isn't easy, it takes time to get good and a very long time to get great but don't automatically disregard the game as♥♥♥♥♥♥before you play it thats just being naive. I've read some of the negative comments on steam for Rocket League and they are a perfect example. I understand the game isn't for everyone but what I am saying is it is worth trying if you don't like it refund it. I could have continued this review and I am sure I could have written it better I haven't written many reviews. if I can update it I will later but I hope that this helps."

Nothing like chasing after the ball that's going towards your goal, flying, and knocking the ball away to win in the last 10 seconds. No other game will make you freak out over simple stuff like Rocket League does... unless you play/watch competitive Smash... or you are 10 and play COD. This game is meant to be played with friends so you can communicate and scream at each other for giving up a goal. I can now read my friend's mind after playing with him so much.I've only had a few problems with matchmaking, and that was when I was starting out and was really bad. Now I'm just sorta bad. I've also only had one problem with the servers timing out, punishing me, and locking me out of matchmaking for 15 minutes, but it gave me an excuse to do the aerial training and play 1v2 with bots. Also, bots suck most of the time, but are extremely frustrating at other times when they get perfect shots off at ridiculous angles. Just play with friends or strangers if you have no friends. Just go make a friend. Or don't. Its your life.9/10 - there is no Turkey hat for ThanksgivingEdit:This game has become my favorite game to play on Steam.  I cannot recommend this game enough.  The level of skill you develop with this game is pretty incredible.  You go from barely being able to time your jump to hit the ball to doing incredible aerials off the walls to get an incredible shot on goal only to have the defense make an equally incredible save.  With some of the hits that I manage to get and the incredible angles that you can get shots from is shocking to say the least.  Its amazing that your brain can wire itself to think you have to roll at this millisecond in order to slip it between two defenders and roll it into the goal... but I'm just rambling now.Now stay with me here, I'm gonna say something that you might freak out over.  You can turn back now if you want.  Still here? Alright... 3... 2... I think this game has the same feel as Smash does in the sense that there is just an incredibly high skill ceiling.  Yep, I said it.  But seriously, watch some of the top players in the world who play this game.  Its a work of art how they can move their car so accurately whether it be in the air or on the ground for the perfect shot or pass.  Oh the passing... I almost forgot.  Once you get to a certain level of play, you start thinking of how to pass it to you teammate who is flying down middle for a small tap in goal.  I'm not talking about centering off the corner, I mean like popping it up in the middle from mid field and basically setting it for a teammate to get a shot on goal.  It become something more than ""hey lets hit this ball as hard as we can"" to ""hey, Imma try and tip it up for you and throw off the defense for an open goal"".Only one last thing to keep in mind is that while a lot of the community is nice and friendly, there are a LOT of toxic players who play this game and they will drive you nuts for the 7 minutes that it takes to complete a game.  Be warned.  If you get this game or currently play it, be nice for everyone's sake and have some fun :)All in all, my favorite game on Steam -  10/10 they gave us a cockroach for a hat"

Competitive is optimized well and they are always tweaking it. Competitive can be frustrating but that is the same with any game. Overall i would say this game is a solid 9.5/10.

Not only that, but to have a massive fan-base to be a part of, and Devs who want the best for us players, make this game really stand out. The vehicles are really creative in design, but help the matches in their own way as well. You can but also can't have every vehicle do well in Offense and Defense unless you know how your vehicle works. If you have a larger vehicle, try for defense and guarding your goal. Small and nimble? Try to out-do your opponet in offense. Besides that, there's one drawback...Lag. It's killer. And I MEAN killer! If you have lag at all, expect to do absolutely terrible because you eventually wont know East from West when driving. If you have multiple games and a normal computer as I do, tone down your graphics to Mid-Low. Not all the way low, 'cause then it looks like mush on wheels, but low so it works good. Then try one level higher and find how your computer does with Mid or Mid-High. Remember, performance is better than graphics. Especially in this game.Putting that drawback aside, this game is very, very good. It'll give you a rush when the going gets tough, but it can also annoy the heck out of you when you cannot seem to get a goal or win a match. To wrap this up, be a good sport about losing and enjoy the game as much as the rest of us do. Keep on playing everyone, and I'll see you on the field!"

This isn't a ""oh 20XX only final destination"" type thing, this is moreso like banning Hyrule Temple.-Network issues - you will hit the ball so many times and NOTHING will happen, you'll just pass through. Then there's the issue of seeing one thing and the other actually happening, such as you hitting the ball but on the server side you flipped too late or something. Very bogus.-Physics sometimes don't make sense - ball seemingly speeds up for no reason, car takes a very long time to fall but the ball seems to fall very fast (or sometimes very slow, really depends), hitting the ball below max boost can *sometimes* put it to full speed while others not, it seems very inconsistent-Not a lot of transparency from the devs - ""all cars are exactly the same....okay they have different hitboxes but other than that they're still completely the sa--...okay yeah they all have different turn radiuses but that's not a big deal cause everywhere else they're still the same.""Choosing your car IS important, some need cars that pop it up easier, like the hotshot, and some want to keep it on the ground, like the merc. Except you probably shouldn't choose the merc if you can't powerslide properly yet as that has almost the worst turn radius in the game. Why they feel the need to hide this from the players is beyond me.They also completely hide the matchmaking, having hidden MMR that pairs you up. Even though the matchmaking sucks. You either get dominated or you dominate. Hardly ever in between. Even though I was in bronze I was still getting matched up with gold players. Which is absolutely ridiculous.I still recommend this game because if you play it for ten minutes here and there, it's really fun and if you wanna play a lot more, it's still really fun. But everytime I play I eventually stop because of frustration. Mostly because of the physics engine ♥♥♥♥ing up, like not transferring momentum properly.Also, side note as this is not critical of the actual game, the community is VERY toxic. If you aren't good, everyone trash talks you, including your teammates. A lot of smurfing goes on and they are consistently ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, making fun of people that only have 30 hours in the game whereas they have 700. So yeah, be aware of that."

One thing that caught my attention was the idea to customize your car with a bunch of items. The method to add items to celebrate a few of events was good. Honestly this game kept busy for more hours this year.What I did to write this review was to propose to add some DLC like NBA FLAG that contain the alpha period items (Goldstone Wheels, Gold Rush Boots, Gold Nugget Antenna and Gold Cap Topper) of course at a price higher than other DLC because all players have started playing later to can somehow get all items, even if it was limited edition and I guess the best way to do that it is to pay for them.Also, the system to reward the ranking standings is good. But, the are players who cant climb the leaderboard and can not get awards. Propose the idea to do items DLC for every end season that contain the items which were offered as rewards for respectively season. Again at a price higher than the other DLC. I can bet that there are players who play this game for idea of collector items game like me. I hope to add this idea to the game. Congratulation, you do a great job!"

I'm writing this review because I felt it was necessary to inform others on this or to try and help someone to decide wether or not to get the game.I bought Rocket League a few days ago (after posting this) and I must say I was excited to jump into it. I started playing the single player/seasons mode to get used to how the game works (after playing the tutorial of course). After only 2 hours of game play i absolutely loved it! Even if it were just vsing AI.The graphics: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10 (there isn't much to it other than just scoring goals and defending, but even with these two small main objectives, it's a hell of a lot fun)Overall view of it: 9/10I enjoyed the 2 hours of what I played of the game, however it then came down to the multiplayer.Since I live in South Africa it is usual that i get +-100 ping on any European server I play on (Europe being the closest to where i stay), which I knew i was going to encounter, since on any other game I play, 100 ping is nothing and barely effects me. However with Rocket League it's different.With 120 ping, i could not play, constant jittering back and forth. I understand the game was just released, i expected servers to be down, and have some connectivity issues, however I did not anticipate the game braking 100 ping.In the end, the game itself is absolutely amazing! Fun to play with friends or competitively (I can get very competitive when i vs anything/anyone, even with the AI). However if you live far from any of the servers (Europe, US East, US West and Oceanic) and are expecting to play with decent amount of ping, don't. I cannot emphasise enough how much i love this game, but unfortunatly, i cannot play multiplayer, even when my connectivity is at it's fullest.I sincerely hope that they expand on their servers (possibly bringing one to africa :) ? ) and I wish the game best of luck for the future.P.S. (get this game and a few friends, and never see the sun again ""c'mon guys, one more round? :)""  )"

,Recommended,252950,29104528,Posted: 7 January,all,[RRL] PatMan,"I was not paid to write this review. I paid for my copy of the game (and three copies for friends on steam). I paid for the keys to open crates in-game.PC Used: i7-4790k; GTX 1080; 24gb RAM; 1tb SSD.4K support on PC version works flawlessly and a single GTX 1080 provides more than 60fps constantly on Ultra settings. It is eye-blindingly gorgeous.Synopsis: Rocket League is football, hockey and basketball with cars.Review:Not since the days of picking up Mario Kart for the first time has a racing game been so engrossing and immediately addictive. Rocket League has a thriving online community, integrated play between console and PC players, and enough fun and engaging customization options to allow everyone to drive a car that feels immediately theirs.Dare to look beneath the hood and you will find this is a game that has a subtle but definite skill curve. Even after hundreds of hours you will find that you are still improving the look of the car and modifying the way that you play. The geniuses at Psyonix have built a game that genuinely seeps with their obsession to get everything just right. From the car mechanics, to the ball physics, and to the curvature of the arena walls that you will begin driving up and using as though gravity does not apply to the likes of you.There is a great crate system. Crates are earned through play-time and they require keys to open. Keys can be purchased at an additional cost or earned through trading other items or crates for them). It is often possible to land items in crates from time to time that can be extremely valuable; for instance, I now have numerous rare animated car decals and painted wheels that are worth between 20 keys and 40 keys each (twice the value of buying the game!).There is nothing quite as satisfying and rapid a multiplayer experience online and I whole-hardheartedly encourage you to pick up a copy of this game because you will get much more than your money's worth. The main mode is football, but hockey is just as satisfying. A tip for playing football is to not race to the wall and to anticipate the rebound and position to meet it there. In hockey, the opposite applies and you should gun up the wall to meet the puck on the wall and fire it around the arena towards their goal.This game is the first game I would say has ever come close to a 10/10 for me. Sure, there is even more to look forward to from this game in the future with continued meaningful updates. But whether you buy on xbox, ps4, or Steam, you are in for a brilliant experience. You do not even have to like or be good at FIFA or real football to find this enjoyable, which is testament in itself that it truly holds its position as a bonafide e-sport of its own.The e sport competition each year with the best players has a prize pool of $125,000 and will keep growing.CONCLUSION:Amazing stuff. You won't be disappointed."

All the reviews were good but there was something about it that I thought, didn't appeal to me.I was totally wrongWho would have thought that mixing football and destruction derby/micro machines/whatever would be such a success!This game is so much fun and totally easy to get to grips with but difficult to master, no doubt.The cars are awesome, remind me of my old micro machines and you can do plenty of customisation to them, purely cosmetic. Decent soundtrack and nice looking environments/textures.I regret not getting it sooner but i'm looking forward to playing this lots in the future. great game!"

Within a few seconds both the ball and every player will be flying all over the place.I've had so much fun in the few hours I've played this game already and it's only getting better. The graphics are great and fit the insanely fast mayham perfectly, the maps are all the same but they all have different themes.One thing that's great about this game though is the high skill level that you can reach. There is such a big difference in a newbie and the top players that it's hard to put into words, getting better at this game just feels so rewarding because of how much of the cars movement you can control. Speaking about controls, they're great. It never feels clunky and they're easy to get used to. Matchmaking is decent, Playing with players with a higher ping can lead to a few seconds being spent to get every player in sync, though it doesn't last long and it makes it a bit more fair to the people enslaved by terrible internet providers. You won't have trouble finding a lobby to join, you join a random lobby, either one just starting or one in progress, except in ranked mode, where of course you start a brand new match. The music in the game is great aswell, though it's only heard in the main menu which I found was a tad disappointing.I can't really think about much I didn't like about the game, I've had so many fun moments that they've made me forget all the frustrating games I have encountered, with either toxic teammates or people leaving, though that's hard to avoid.So overall I would strongly recommend this game. It will keep you entertained especially if you have friends to join you, and always remember to aim for the moon."

YOU GODDAMN KID, LEAVE ME ALONE OR I'LL CRY I SWEAR!!).That said, I keep going back to the game, because after I've taken a few deep breaths and spent a lot of time swearing angrily and grumbling to myself like an alcoholic with tourettes I decide that it's time to beat myself in the♥♥♥♥♥♥with a hammer once more as ten year olds laugh and point at me for not being able to hit the ball into the net.Better yet, is when I'm 100% sure I AM GOING TO FINALLY SCORE!! but my teammate decides NO, -HE- IS FINALLY GOING TO SCORE!!

At first, you're gonna suck.. HARD, but that's okay. You learn more from your loses than your wins. This is a purely kill-based game that the more and more you play, the better you'll get, thus the more fun it will be. There's single player, there's multiplayer, you can play by yourself in an exhibition match with a few bots if you want, you can play a tournament (in game called a season) with the bots to win a few achiemvements if you wanna test out your skills. There's even a very immersive tutorial and extra practice modes for you to improve your skills on. There is always something for you to find or achieve and even when you've gotten everything, you can always improve. It is just boundless fun."

I told my self i would stop but every day i kept doing it. Finally my mom did it. She made me quit. She took my computer and i was forced to stop playing rocket league. Now im back to smoking again.All jokes aside: Game 99.9/100 would recommend to anyone who has a brain.

There's no other word in the English language to describe the absolute beauty and cleverness of the game. Every second counts, and there is always something happening. You can find a match in 30 seconds, almost always. There is a Season/Career mode which lets you be a part of a ""pro"" team and face off in an actual Rocket League season against bots of varying difficulty. I've been craving a competitive alternative to the all-consuming abyss that is CSGO, and i 100% believe that I've found it."

It feels like everytime you play, ridiculous plays happen, causing both teams to get hyped up. It's easy to learn the basics, but there is an insane skill cap meaning truly great players can run circles around you... so that means there's a ton you can get better at, so you can replay it endlessly. The game is quick to load, so you can hop right in and play. Games are fast but intense. There are unlockable items, but one item unlocks pretty much everytime you complete a match. There's light car customization (cosmetics only!), and honestly this is probably the weakest part of the game... it could be so much better, but it's enough to have fun with and provides a decent amount of uniqueness. There's some affordabale DLC for more personalization.No real complaints about the game... you can sometimes get bad teammates, but you can always re-queue and get different people. It feels like the game is probably going to keep growing, and is only at its early stages of life.It's highly advised to play with a controller... I haven't used keyboard and mouse, but very few people seem to... you can still do well with them, but the precision of a controller with steering and rolling your car is a huge advantage right off the bat."

If you don't have any friends the game's bots work well, although they are pretty easy even when set to their hardest difficulty. I'd equate the bots on ""All-Star"" to a real player who is around ""Semi-Pro"". There is an exp point system and leveling up, but it doesn't do anything other than change the status displayed underneath your name such as ""Rookie, Semi-Pro, Pro, Veteran, Expert, Master, Legend"" of which you can opt out of displaying. There are multiple camera options (can be very helpful) and graphics options. There are multiple servers in many regions, and you can toggle which regions to connect to. Also, the developers keep the game updated and release both free and purchasable content from time to time.The game itself is soccer but with cars. Cars that can jump! And if you are good enough, cars that can even fly haha. There are boost pads that speed you up and you can use the boost to ""aerial"" as well.Cool side-note: This is the first game for PC that is cross-platform with both Xbox One and Playstation 4 players. If you are playing a match and notice someone's picture says ""PSY NET"" that means that they are using a console.Not much else to say other than try this game out for yourself!"

It was the game that got me to give up my Call of Duty days on console. Why should you get this game? There are two main reasons for me to list among the hundred others have mentioned.1. This game has the best developer support I have ever seen in my 15+ years of gaming. Their reddit is loaded with fan suggestions that make it into the game. The devs are quick and responsive about server downtime, and do their best to offer new content in the most inclusive ways possible. All DLC is optional, as it's mostly cosmetic. They just recently offered support to Steam Workshop maps just so it was easier to enjoy community mods!This game is the product of the best ongoing conversation from developer to gamer. Period.2. Rocket League is easy to pick up, but hard to master. This formula is becoming really popular with most modern releases and I'm glad it's here as well. If you and friends want to buy a simple game for the laughs, this is it. If you want a game that can challenge you every day you play it, this is for you. If you're looking for a game that has a ranked system designed to help you grow the more you play, this game is for you.This game has been one of the most exhilarating and addicting games of my life. It's amazing how such a simple concept could become such an incredible experience.NOTE: PLAY THIS GAME WITH A CONTROLLER! Thank me later."

You might start the game and find yourself being terrible at playing soccer, missing the ball or crashing against your teammates.But the more you struggle to become better at this game, the more fun you have, because in this game as you go higher in the skill cap, you also go higher on the playability and just have a good time overall.But beware before buying this game, if you are not prepared to dedicate a bit of your time to improve your performance at Rocket League, you will probably just stay stuck at a certain skill cap.Rocket League is a game that trully requires dedication and effort.But it's cheap so do whatever you want.

I love this game specifically because driving games have always had a soft spoit in my heart and because the competition is always a blast to play against, but let this be a note for people interested in this game:Though this game is a blast to play, the first few hours will be the most difficult. Though the initial busrt of excitement of playing this game got me through my inability to play well (note that I am still not too good, despite my hours), it may not be the same for others. So if you do run into a wall where it becomes difficult to play because you're not doing as well as you like, try to watch some Youtube videos, or find a few friends to play with. Playing with friends makes the game so much more enjoyable (and possible), and watching the videos really helped me later on.The only reason why I've played as much RL as I have is because I strive to get better and do awesome things, and I suggest you do the same. Just mindlessly playing this game gets really boring.Lastly, don't go into this game thinking you'll be a rocketeer in an hour. You probably figured out from what I've said previously that this game takes a lot of practice to do well, so keep in mind it will take time to become skillfull.(P.S. several comments say that Psyonix's servers are iffy, but for me [in central KS] they are fine.)"

I mean, what more could you wish for?This is a great game for both the casual player and the one willing to invest hundreds of hours into mastering every single aspect of this game. The classic ""easy to learn, hard to master"" experience.It has a working online match-making system for teams with up to 4 players, which never lets you wait for your match for longer than half a minute. But there is also a season mode for the single player experience as well as split-screen coop, both online and local only, for up to 4 players, which already is a sensation on its own for today's gaming standards.And as if this was not enough already, the game also properly works. It is kind of sad that one has to congratulate a game developer for making a proper, finished game - but judging by the flood of early-access-pre-alpha-beta-not-finished games that pop up everywhere, one has to really compliment Psyonix for releasing a game that is as well polished as Rocket League is. You are likely to never run into a game-breaking bug, or any bug at all, and Psyonix did a great job of getting the best performance and quality out of the Unreal 3 engine.To sum it all up: I can really recommend Rocket League.

Looks cool, but meh, it's just soccer, and over the years I've almost had my fill of driving games... I did this several times. I could see the draw but never was pushed to get it.Then came the free weekend. I decided to try it, cause why not? It's basically a demo of the game for a weekend. Well, after about half an hour I was freakin hooked. My niece and her husband came over to hang out and he and I were hotseating the controller after each match. It's freakin epic. It's almost as fun to watch as it is to play. We were almost hoarse afterwards from cheering and jeering during the game.Needless to say, I purchased the game and a couple DLCs because it's so damn good. The pacing is perfect. Every moment has you on the edge of your seat. It's literally all killer no filler. Even in the rare times you wait for new players, you are still playing in the lobby, no downtime or boredom.

Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still♥♥♥♥♥♥Pro - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller,♥♥♥♥♥♥head.Veteran - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!Expert - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.Master - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.Legend - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""Rocketeer - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA).Think about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game.

The SP is amazing and probably the best part of the game the AI is actually pretty good, but a competive game like this is always better when played with other people. Or at least it should be.I am also uncertain if the different car parts and types actually make a difference. There isn't any stats listed but certain cars feel faster then others.EDIT: After spending the evening playing it with some friends I have switch my recommendation to yes, however I still stand by what I say, this game needs more content and a better online system before I will say it was worth $20.

Instead, every car has the same speed and abilities, making every match as fair as possible. Without fancy upgrades or items it all comes down to skill. Double-jumping at the right time to make that save; flipping your car mid-air to perform a perfect shot; activating boost to reach the ball before your opponent does. In a time where every game tries to be bigger and more over-the-top, it's a breath of fresh air to play something simple that is actually fun.Edit: Some days ago, the mutators-update was added. It's a free update which allows (not forces) players to modify game elements like gravity, ball size, bounciness, etcetera. It makes for both a hilarious and refreshing experience, while normal modes are still available. Free updates like this make Rocket League better than most AAA-titles, at only one-third of the price."
,Recommended,252950,31232713,Posted: 19 April,all,Genesis 3vz,"I was first skeptical about buying a random car game with soccer in it and was presumably gonna just refund after the first game but once I played a few more to see how ""trash"" this game could really be. I sow how diverse the skill level is in the game and how funny yet serious the community communicates I realized it's made for anyone. The customization in Rocket League is wonderful. Upon just starting, you're given few cars, decals, wheels, toppers, boost, etc.  As you play, more customization options are randomly unlocked upon completing a match which felt awesome it was as if anyone could be rewarded on how bad you were at the game but for some odd reason made you strive to better yourself to be the best. The ways you can customize cars is endless which is also a benefit that most games don't give, with no two cars looking the same. The customization has no effect on the stats of each car, giving everyone their own unique diversity. On the topic of stats, the bodies of each car do have individual stats. Hitboxes, turn radius, and acceleration times all become a factor when choosing a car that suits you. In conclusion, you can't always judge a book by its cover. I went from thinking this game would be a complete disgrace to loving whole heartedly and I've been into many YouTube channels based on (ex: campingrusher my personal fav.

The great thing is, you don’t need to know anything about driving games or soccer to play. The rules are simple: drive really fast around bright, glossy, neon colored arenas and do fancy tricks while trying to smash an endlessly ricocheting ball into a deceptively tight space.The heart of Rocket League lives in that feeling of unrestricted movement. It’s thanks in large part to the use of what I would call “physics plus,” where the laws of gravity and momentum get a colorful overhaul to allow for driving on the walls and ceiling, and ridiculous mid-air direction changes that would liquefy the driver in the real world. But its fantastic movement is so arcadey and satisfying that I often have to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the tricks when a simple nudge or bump will do.I rate this 10/10"

I have only played it 26~ hours so far, but I feel like this game is really worth the 20€. I felt like this game was really expensive, and that it would be one of those games you play for a few hours and have fun, and then you never play it anymore because you get tired of it, but Rocket League is really not like that, except the ""fun"" part, I have played 26 hours so far as I mentioned earlier, and atlest 25 hours are happy hours, and the other 1 hour is chilli'n in the lobby.This game is so much fun and I would recommend everyone to buy it, yes, it's pretty expensive, but it's totaly worth it in my opinion.I am accualy gonna rate this game 10/10, Rocket League can not really improve anything because it's so perfect I think, or they could add more hats/cars/map etc, but I'm sure they will. Another thing that would be so much fun is different game modes/workshop friendly, so you could make like parkour maps, or fly maps with infinite boost. This game got so much potential and I hope they add more stuff, even though the game is amazing so far.This review became pretty long, but as I am trying to say, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!(Some people say they have lag, especially european servers, but I dont feel that at all)"

,Recommended,252950,31556039,Posted: 5 May,all,botch,"I figured since I've now put over 1000 hours into the game, I should give it a review...This is by far my favorite game ever. The controls are very smooth, the gameplay is fast-paced and super competitive, the customization that comes with the cars is limited; yet there is so much you can do (they have to keep it that way to stay true to orange side/blue side), and the content updates are always jam packed with new stuff and usually always free. Even if I am getting flammed by my teammate, I am still thoroughly enjoying the game. It is great if you just want to play something casual and mess around with friends or if you want to take it seriously and climb the ranked ladder. It is just such a fun idea for a game and I never knew how much I needed it in my life. I love this game so damn much.This doesn't mean there is no cons to the game though.. There is quite a steep learning curve and it will take quite a few hours of gameplay to be able to fly and pull off crazy plays. The servers have been awful the past few months and I do hope they get that situation together (I will say it is not game-breaking, just inconvenient sometimes). Last con, for me personally, is that they have maps like Starbase Arc and Wasteland in the ranked playlist. Those 2 maps are quite different from the rest in terms of design and shape and really throw off the ranked playlist.10/10 would 100% recommend this game."

There is other DLC you can pay for to support Psyonix but it's not a pay to win type DLC scenario.- Very chilled, the community is one of the best I've ever experienced in online gaming. Had a bad day at the office? Come home and play some Rocket League to relax. Getting battered by EAids on FIFA? Play some Rocket League to remember why you play games, for enjoyment. Not playing well? It's alright, most teammates will be very understanding and there are quite a few who will offer you tips on how to improve!- You don't have to be good to enjoy it. I've played almost 50 hours on this wonderful piece of art and must admit I'm still pretty bad. I can't aerial to save my life and am an awful goalie.

There are many things that Rocket League is good at, and others not so much. Psyonix did a great job with game experience, graphics, and not so much the Compet. system (in some ways more than others)Rocket league has a fenominal experience... A great theme song to launch the game, and the vibe gives you excitement, you're ready to play the game... But hold your horses! You need to first learn how to play! (All though it could be improved) It's great, lets you learn the basic controls and get a grasp on what you're playing. An exciting game, and very competitive, and aggresive if you let it. You can be pretty much anyone you want to be in the game, to an extent, be a Merc, blowing everyone up, or be in the New Type-S and do Freestyle dribble goals rocking your certified Parylax Mystery Decal. It's rewarding, especially when it takes nearly a year fo ryou to get to Rising Star. You get so pumped when you know you've made it all worth the wait, hard work, and endlessly farming XP to gloat you're a higher level than them... And all of this... 580.7 hours on a Blue Star. Maybe a Season 2 Rocket Trail or two, but seriously? We've become blind from the fact that we spend all of our time... staring into an screen. Just 5 more minutes... Always the same thing...And what else could add to the already unbelieveable amount of detail and finishing touches? Graphics. They are astonishingly good for what this game is. I have never experienced any glitches or faults in the textures, and there are very little ways to screw up the game. This game is VERY well built, and practically troll-proof other than Just messing around by blowing others up into flames, or just trolling the goal hog who keeps saving all of your air dribbles. I have yet to experience any glitches like going thorugh the wall above the goal like others have, but it seems very hard to do, and I'm sure has been patched. They have been pushing out new content constantly, and are like a well-oiled machine. They never stop. New decals here, New Crates there, and a whole new trading system everywhere. Cross-network integration is seemless, Other than communication, sadly. Psyonix have done an EXELENT job and I would have been missing out if I had missed this when it got popular! (But missed Alpha items) Sadly.Though, there are tons of things I LOVE about this game, there are a select few I don't. One of those is part of the competitive system. But before we hate on psyonix, lets thing positively. Servers are rarely down, matchmaking is always getting improved, and Rage Quiters get what the deserve. But these are the good things, and the only bad thing is about Internet. and Power outages, Lost connection, or bad ping. All of these are counted against you, immediately ranking down one division. This sucks. A lot. Especially with my spotty Internet, It's gone down and back up 9 times in the past 2 hours, and have to wait until Sunday. Luckily, I was able to rejoin the game most of the time. a couple times I got disconnected and divisioned down. And eventually after the 3rd disconnect, I lost my rising star rank and spent the next 2 hours (after a motum restart which seemed to temporarily  fix the problem) I spent trying to rank up to rising star again, not knowing when season 3 ends. I know Psyonix can't do much about this as I'd rather get punished for something I did not deserve than a quiter not getting what they deserve.Overall, a FANTASTIC game, great everything from support, to forums. They have great gameplay and community, graphics and cross-play is seemless. I give this game easily a 10/10. Even it has some negatives,  There are no games in the world of 7.4 billion people that could exist. Nothing is perfect, and as soon as you realize that, the better."

'Rocket League became♥♥♥♥♥♥ they added crates in it to get more money' or 'Lord Gabe has reached even Rocket League.'  Well you should think before you say kiddo. The game that we see now, all the cars, fixes, maps and graphics, this all costs money for them.  They can't just spend all the money from their wallet and make everything free. Moreover, those crates aren't that bad.Firstly, if u don't like seeing them in your inventory, just go to settings and  hide them man.In one game you can get both crates and normal items, so they don't depend on your drop.Secondly, they are so rare, even if you don't like them, you can trade them on something you actually want.Thirdly, the keys are pretty cheap and the crates contain so much cool stuff, those wheels or cars, or black market decals, this sounds cool, at least for me.Lastly, they even say at the bottom of the crate that if  you open it, that half of the key money goes to the rocket league price pool, so that rocket league will improve itself as  a cyber sport gameI guess, this should be enough proof to stop all the hate about the crates.P.S. Don't expect Rocket League  to allow selling content on the steam community market. They don't want to repeat Payday mistake."

I have 400+ hours on PS4, and didn't hesitate to buy it on PC as well.You can pick this game up and instantly be able to participate in a meaningful way in online matches, but the game will push you to progress along with your competition. You will start out celebrating a goal, then celebrate a backflip goal, then celebrate an aerial goal, before celebrating a backwards/upside down/freestyle/aerial goal.Matches have a 5 minute timer, and so you end up saying ""just one more game before bed"" until you realize it's 2am.If you have friends I definitely recommend bringing them along the learning process with you. If not, then you can meet plenty of nice people from within the game.UPDATE: 1000 hours in the PC version now. I also have the Collector's Edition for XB1 and PS4 now.

This game is just about playing football with cars, it's fun and it's extremely addictive. Also, a lot of stuff is still added to the game (some free, some as DLC), like new game modes (Snow Day, Hoops, Rumble), new cars, standard items, painted and certified items etc. The only thing i would say is bad in Rocket League is that the developers adding non-standard maps into standard playlists and they don't care about that it changes the gameplay and majority of the players don't like those maps. It would be best if there were separate playlists with standard and non-standard maps for all modes. I'm sure it would make both sides (those who like non-standard maps and those who doesn't) happy. Unfortunately the developers still don't want to hear about this, hopefully they will in the future. But this is really the only thing i found that i don't like in Rocket League, there is nothing else, all other things are positive so i definitely recommend this game. Also, nominated for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" award :D. Result: 9,9/10 (just because of those non-standard maps, otherwise it would be 10/10)Update: After the autumn update 2017 the non-standard maps are no longer included in standard playlists (those non-standard maps were remade into standard ones). Psyonix announced they changed their policy and from now they will focus only on standard maps. The non-standard maps are included now only in separate playlist (Rocket Labs) and Rumble mode. Now i really don't see anything that would be bad in this game. Result: 10/10"

Our opinions may differ. Thank you.ConsLet's get this out of the way.• Game is largely based around the controller, playing with a keyboard and mouse will not give you the ""full experence"" so to speak.• Oh heavens, I'm in Salt Lake City. The community is just filled with rude salty players. (Of course, this is just from my experience.)• God, the game's beautiful but dayum that's not a lot of frames.• Psyonix, was making the Mac version so hard? (I bet it was so good work I love youuuuu <3)• 4v4's will melt your brain.ProsOh dear this is gonna take a while...• The game is beautiful. (If you have a good computer, that is. If you're like me you play on the lowest settings.)▪ The cars are well designed, and the hitboxes feel perfect. The small variances among the cars, like the turning radius and again, the hitboxes, are a nice addition and proves the devs' attention to detail.• DLC is cheap but rewarding; never misleading or disappointing.•MASAMUNE IS BAE• Matchmaking usually doesn't take more than a few minutes.▪ It surprisingly makes you want to learn and practice more, something that I personally don't usually do in games.• Free training is simultaneously the reason I live and the reason I'm trash lol• The trading system is actually used, and has a very good payoff that makes you want to play more.• Rumble hype.• Customization is very fun and engrossing to an extent, I can find myself picking out colors and trails that match with a certain car.

Playing solo is tons of fun, but it's much better playing with someone else. This is a team based game and if you play solo you run the risk of getting stuck with people  who don't know right from left and have an IQ below 90. That would be my only negative, but it can be resolved by playing with someone and it's easy to meet people while playing.The community feels a bit dead on the forums compared to almost every other popular game I play. I'm really not sure why that is, but it's not a huge issue or anything. Matchmaking is a bit funky, sometimes I get put against people of equal rank and other times they are 3+ ranks higher and this is when I don't wait a while for matches.. Sometimes I go solo q and get matched vs premades of 1 or 2 ranks higher..Outside of grim dawn this might be the best game for under 20$ that I've seen."

Essentially a simple, well-refined formula, with an arsenal of modern bell and whistles to put it far above the competition. The visuals, audio, netplay, customization,  and interface are all a pleasure, but the tactile controls are what really shines. The game encourages you to ""Become one with your vehicle!"" Okay, it doesn't actually say this directly, but its implicit. The whole idea is to use the rocket car as an extension of yourself, the way a tennis player uses their racquet. When you're diving in among everyone else, the anticipation can be enough to make you flinch and jump in your seat. This game is exactly what e-sports needs: more balls and less fluff."

Hasilnya? Game yang sederhana namun adiktif! Rocket League kini telah merambah ke PS4 dan pelanggan PlayStation Plus US bisa mendapatkannya secara cuma-cuma pada bulan Agustus kemaren.Kelebihan+ seperti layaknya bermain bola tetapi menggunakan sebuah mobil.+ harga yang terhitung murah dengan permainan yang sangat menarik+ ketika game ini keluar, ia termasuk 5 game terpopuler di steam. bahkan sampai review ini saya tulis masih menduduki 10 besar player terbanyak steam.+ file size gamenya 2.29gb cukup kecil dibandingkan dengan semua game yang baru saja keluar.+ pemainnya banyak sehingga finding match cepat sekali.+ seperti dota 2, dan counter strike. dsini cuman ada skins yang tidak dapat merubah status kekuatan anda.+ soundtracknya keren-keren+ online play 1v1,2v2,3v3,4v4. baik itu match biasa ataupun ranked match.+ online stats setiap player sangat lengkap+ ada voice chatnya+ compatible with gamepad. tapi jujur lebih mudah pake gamepad.+ graphic sangat detail dan ringan.+ background music ketika di home menu, sangat enak di dengar. benar-benar seperti ketika anda bermain Pro Evolution Soccer yang dimana menu = musik yang enak di dengar.+ background music ketika bermain sama dengan PES tetapi yang membuatnya berbeda adalah ketika waktu sudah menunjukkan 10 detik. anda akan mendengar penonton bersorak berhitung dari 10 sampai dengan 1+ bisa crossplay. artinya anda bisa matchmaking dan ketemu orang yang bermain menggunakan ps4.+ customize disesuaikan dengan level anda. jadi makin tinggi level anda makin banyak customize tersedia untuk anda.+ setiap mobil anda, ada catatan kemenangan. sehingga anda tau mobil mana yang membuat banyak kemenangan anda.+ mobilnya bisa lompat-lompat, ada boostnya juga, bisa terbang-terbang.+ waktu matchmacking cuman 3 menit tapi serasa sejam.Kekurangan- kadang laghing karena rocket league belum memiliki server asian.- permainan ini tidak mudah untuk dipelajari anda butuh waktu untuk mempelajarinya.- tutorial tidak otomatis ketika masuk game, sehingga banyak yang berpikir ketika pertama kali main, ""ini adalah permainan yang mudah""- beberapa user tidak suka settingan default view camera. dikarenakan terlalu dekat, dan membuat user bingung memainkan rocket leagueApakah Game ini direkomendasikanyoi bro, ini adalah game yang sangat saya rekomendasikan. jujur saya bukan penggemar pemain Pro Evolution Soccer tetapi jika anda memainkan ini anda akan mendapatkan pengalaman yang sangat jauh berbeda dengan permainan lain. mengapa saya katakan demikian karena anda disini menggunakan sebuah mobil untuk mencetak sebuah gol kemenangan.susah gak mainnya? yah jelas susah karena ini termasuk gameplay baru untuk sebuah permainan klasik sepakbola. jadi saya sangat merekomendasikan bagi anda yang mempunyai gamepad untuk memainkan game ini.kalau susah tutorialnya jelas gak? tutorial jelas kok, tetapi beneran susah bener. awalnya saya juga nonton twich, dengar-dengar cerita dari orang katanya gamenya keren. terus liat di youtube n twich keknya mudah ini gamenya ah.. pasti saya juga bisa. ternyata susah coi... selamat berlatih yah, soalnya saya baru level 7 waktu menulis review ini dan alhamdulillah sudah bisa mencetak gol walaupun bukan aerial gol.terus graphicnya bagus gak? yah jelas bagus, game baru. dan lagi cuman spek rendah kok.klo dikasih rate, kira-kira dikasih berapa? klo saya, saya akan kasih 9/10. kenapa cuman 9, soalnya 1nya itu bwat gw susah jadi pro :D,,, ahahahahhaa,, gitu amat yah...dengar-dengar katanya ini game laghnya? gak juga kok, klo di awal seh saya juga lagh, tetapi waktu baca review orang-orang kaskus, saya jadi pilih server ocenia, ternyata lancar jaya.. :Dsekian dari review saya, selamat malam."

Even better if you play with friends, which is mostly why I play this game.Bought this game back in August because my friend recommended it to me but I mostly played on my own and lost a lot of interest for it. I only started returning to this game in April because more of my friends started playing it again and ever since then I've started to fall in love with this game again. This game both suits casual and competitive gamer, I myself am a competitive gamer along with my friends and the competitive mode is just as good as casual at the best of times. Overall I think that this game, along with the updates made this game way better than the original game which was a PlayStation 3 exclusive (and one I never played as I never heard of it until Rocket League came out). A downside is that the official dedicated servers can suffer from poor performance at times, for example the servers can produce a lot of lagspikes at the worst of times and it can be very annoying. The game in my opinion is also not worth £15 so I would highly recommend buying this game during a sale if you want to buy it. Other than that, this game is one of my new favourite games of all time and I 100% recommend you buy this game whenever you can :)Also, feel free to check out a video I made on Rocket League which shows the fun and excitement you can get out of it!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k0PP5ZVX5g"

Check it out! It's likely that you'll have some fun with this one. It is subtly complex, which I really appreciate in a game. Most of all, the developers are not wallet-gouging DLC lovers. Instead, they offer paid DLC that isn't necessary for the full experience, along with fresh FREE maps for everyone with each DLC update! I buy the DLC simply to support this practice because I think more developers should be doing this nowadays.Anywho, I highly recommend this game, and hope that you check it out. It's a fun one. :)"

You start out thinking ""Man this is pretty fun""  Even when you start out you'll be making crazy shots. Then you figure out there is an air roll button. ""What? Game changer!""  That happens over and over the more you practice little things. Every little improvement you make you will notice. Feel more and more confident with the more control you gain.My favorite part though has to be how great the devs have been. They release free content periodically. They did impliment micro transactions. But it's only for for cosmetics and they give you the option to hide all of that content. They also give you the option to hide the ranked section. They even allow  you turn off voice and text chat if you want to avoid some of the player hate while you're learning and making the inevitable mistakes :P.I don't use these personally but I think that the devs giving players the option is amazing. It's like... Here you go, if you don't want to spend more money and you know you have a tendency to then hide them so you don't feel enticed.

The game is FREE on PS42. There are 1.2 million people on PS4 playing this game3. There are 5000 (peak) on PC playing this game4. This is cross platform, thus PS4 and PC users share the same dedicated server service.5. The developers did not anticipate there being this may people playing the game.6. There are currently not enough server due to the PS4 users and they're adding more as time goes on.I believe the developers are now aware of the situtation and will do their best to support all us PC users.I would definitely recommend this game.

BUT IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR A SMOOTH TASTY MAYONNAISE RECIEPT YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE!Homemade MayonnaiseTime: 5 minutesMakes: 1 cupIngredients2 large eggs, at room temperature2 teaspoons fresh squeezed lemon juice (or vinegar)1 cup of neutral flavoured oil (like light olive oil, grapeseed oil, walnut or sweet almond oil)A pinch of good quality fine grain sea saltTips for Successfully Making MayoUse room temperature eggs. Cold eggs will often result in mayonnaise that does not thicken.Always add the lemon juice first. Lemon juice helps breakdown the protein in the egg yolks so they emulsify better.Start with a VERY slow stream of oil. A few drops at a time is best until you notice the mayonnaise starting to thicken. Once it has started to thicken you can pour the oil in a little quicker.Season the mayonnaise with good quality sea salt and add only a tiny pinch at a time. Mayonnaise can become too salty very easily.Only use fresh squeezed lemon juice. Bottled lemon juice will give your mayonnaise a funny flavour.Use good-quality, free-range eggs — because this condiment is made with raw eggs.Directions1) Gather all your ingredients together. I’ve found that a sturdy whisk works best and a bowl with high sides will help prevent splashes.2) Separate the eggs. Save the egg whites for another purpose (like meringue) and place the egg yolks in a small bowl with high sides.3) Pour the fresh lemon juice into the bowl with the egg yolks and whisk them well. Egg yolks contain a natural emulsifier, lecithin, which helps thicken sauces and bind ingredients.4) Slowly, a few drops at a time, pour the oil into the bowl while whisking constantly. Once the mayonnaise has started to thicken, pour the oil in a slow and steady stream. If the oil starts to build up at all, stop pouring and whisk the mayonnaise briskly until the oil has incorporated.5) If the mayonnaise starts looking too thick, add enough water to thin it to the consistency you like. Add about a teaspoon of water at a time.6) Once all the oil has been mixed in, the mayonnaise should be thick and fluffy, with your whisk forming ribbons through the mixture. Season it carefully with fine grain sea salt. Add a small splash of water if you would like a thinner mayonnaise.Store your homemade mayonnaise in the fridge in a covered container for 3 days.Oh yeah, and the game is pretty good to"

You can unlock some things to customize your car, and that adds some personality to your ride, I like that.

I've always been a fan of creative gameplay mechanics and the dudes behind SARPBC came very close to achieving that but couldn't quite make it. Rocket League's fixed all the problems in the first game delivering a solid and polished experience that will definitely win your heart. As I'm writing this, I'm 800 hours in and still learning something new every day.

Jumping and double jumping / flipping in the air are quite simple to grasp, while mastering how to control your car in the air through boosts and getting those sweet aerial goals is the cherry on top for those who're looking for a skill challenge.Ball physics need a special mention too. They're so incredibly well done that you'll never blame the game for a ""weird bounce"" or an ""unlucky shot that you aimed well but RNGeesus didn't want to go in"". Well, maybe you will, but you'll know you aren't right. The ball reacts just as if you were playing billiards: hit the lower part to lob it over the opposition, hit it dead in the middle to throw a land-to-land missile and hit its sides to angle it at the expense of quite a bit of power. I swear I've even seen how it slightly swerves in the air if you manage to apply some spin to it when hitting it, but that might be my camera angle playing tricks on me.The only flaw I could possibly find in this game is the absence of a couple, or even one, extra gamemode for those times you're feeling goofy and don't want to play plain old (but good) soccer in a standard arena. But considering how young the game is, I'm sure Psyonix has something in their mind regarding this.Get in the action everyone's talking about, you won't regret a single minute, or maybe you'll regret getting addicted.10/10"

It's easy to learn but hard to master. I've had so much of fun with this game. I recomend this. The community for this game is lovely. I've been watching NeatMike and Kronovi lately and it really does make you want to play and master the skills of Rocket League. If you do buy this game, please do buy all the DLC too. The DLC cars are outstanding. My favourite car in this game is the Takumi. There is a crate system, and it's not all that bad. It's pretty decent. You should buy this game. Competitive or casual, it's really fun.This game is a solid 8/10. Good work. ^^"

Takes football, and makes it AMAZING. Like, really amazing. For those who have seen the Top Gear episode where they hit a giant ball around in cars. It's that; just with rocket cars, going 100Kph in 5 minute matches of absolute chaos. It's also cross platform too! Although, I feel that causes an issue I'll get onto later.The game is constant entertainement, the customisation of how you can make your car look, is limiteless, from the badass sports car with flames or go faster stripes, to the derpy-looking truck wearing a propellor cap! The concept is so simple, but every game is a constant burst of adrenaline, and thinking: ""Gotta go fast!"" The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the OST, is gorgeous. Literally, I could give this game a 10/10 right now... There are some issues that have to be addressed.There's some issues I do have with the game though. For example, the camera can twitch a lot when not targeting the ball and ontop of that; it's extremely difficult to pull of any major stunts with a keyboard. It's a game that requires a controller really, and that puts it down a bit on a practical standpoint.The servers SUCK (This could be because of the fact that it's cross platform though). At this current moment in time for the game you need the best of the best internet to be able to play the servers with a solid 40 ping. If anyone else uses your internet in your household (Much like mine) it will be a constant game of teleporting around, trying to strike for a goal and being put back at your side, because of lag. Hopefully this will be addressed at some point, but until then this game gets:9.4/10 Solid game, beautiful OST and graphics, but practicality-wise, a few things need tweaking. I would recommend!"

Even against bots there's a beautiful split between competition and just laughing out loud. The AI itself is pretty decent, ridicuously good at predicting where the ball will drop so you won't win lots of headers, but forgiving enough on pro that you don't feel like a total reject.The online mode though is where it will shine. Everyone will make world class shots and then ten seconds later miss the ball completely or score an own goal. Like I said before, laughing all the time.It's contact football combined with Mario Kart, Micro Machines and I throughly recommend it if you just want to blow off some steam and muck around for a bit."

I haven't had that much fun in years.Pros:1. Very fun to play2. You can customize your car (custom wheels, toppers, antennas, decals, rocket trails and even body kits)3. There are different game modes, such as classic 3v3, 2v2, 1v1, hockey, experimental, rumble, basketball, dropshot4. You can even create custom game and invite other friends to join your match (It's hilarious that you can even change the ball into giant cube or make rocket boost infinite and 10 times more powerful)5. You can save your match and replay it any time from different camera modes (solid montage material)6. New content and constant updates7. Cross-platform supported (Console players can play with/against PC players)8. There are bunch of cheap DLCs with some extra nice cars9.

You'll learn fast that just because you can fly around the map at top speed with ease, that's not always the best approach. It's not the kind of game you'll sit and play for hours at a time, but its one you'll come back to over and over again. Each game takes only 5 minutes, the game is less than 1gig of HDD space, and it loads up quick. Girlfriend runs to the bathroom while you're watching netflix together? Load up Rocket League, play a match and by the time she gets back you're already done. Plus, you won. Achieve victory while others leave the room. Micro-accomplishments gained by tiny rocket cars on a soccer field. $20 seems a bit high priced, but you can always ask Steam for a refund :) A great pick-up-and-play game while taking a break from shooters and RPG's.

Of course it's ridiculously fun. Who would want to live in a world where it wasn't?When you get right down to it, there are two kinds of people out there. Those who love soccer and those who hate it. There isn’t a whole lot of middle ground... The amazing thing about Rocket League is that, as a game, it works extremely well for both kinds of people. I think it comes down to the fundamental nature of rocket cars. Because everyone loves rocket cars. And once you add rocket cars to something, no matter what that thing might have been before, no matter how boring or lame it might have been in its previous existence, it sort of becomes a whole new thing.  A totally awesome new thing with rocket cars.So you’ve got all the best elements of sports – the thrilling victories and crushing defeats, camaraderie and loathing, amazing moments that transcend simple competition – and then you throw in a whole bunch of rocket cars zooming around and flying through the air and demolishing each other in huge explosions, and it gets even more awesome.

They were too lazy to implement a text chat block, where if you got reported or caught by the automated system they would remove your rights to text chat, but no, they just have to outright ban you from playing the game for 24 hours. If their goal is to prevent toxicity, theyre doing a poor job seeing as how I can insult peoples ability to play by using their quick chat options, or simply typing out something that isnt vulgar. Sure bad toxicity has swears in it, but that doesnt mean its only made up of swears. You go into any match in this game you realize when the enemy team scores they'll spam ""thanks"" or ""nice save"". I, personally, couldnt give a sh*t, it doesnt bother me when they do that, but I know some people actually get triggered by the quick chat because they see it as being taunted.I rarely talk sh*t or taunt others, but the one time I do or the one time I talk in chat to sh*t talk my friends in text chat I get banned from playing.I havent even mentioned how I played money for this game, its not a free service, but my review is getting too long so I wont go on.Tl;dr It's absolutely rediculous that I can get banned from playing the game in its entirity simply because you swore, even if it was towards your own queued up teammates as a joke."

There's a huge stigma about microtransactions in games, especially in a game you paid for, it's understandable from a F2P game, they need some sort of income to keep the game free and to keep making content, But when a game you buy decides to pack up some little DLC's into various crates and gives you the chance at getting the particular DLC you want, that's dirty. What could've become more DLC is now locked behind a freemium gambling paywall, with the real DLC I could chose what I wanted and happily pay for it, now I'd have to buy a key, then use that key on a crate, and hope that I get the item I wanted, if not, I'd have to buy another key, potentially spending more money on useless items, than I would on an actual DLC pack I actually wanted, not fun.This game was fantastic, the graphics, the feel, the cross-platform, now it's just another soon-to-be F2P money ♥♥♥♥♥.To sum up the EULA, Psysonix has complete control over you, they can sell your data on, They can take the game away from you and deny you access for life if they see fit.

This review is particulary directed to those wishing to purchase the game residing in Oceania and Asia. There are massive issues with the rocket league servers which has persisted over a number of updates and the devs appear to have no intention of fixing the issue. On an average game I would have ~100-180 ping. However, this doesnt represent the true value of the ping as it feels like 900 ping. When you fly up to hit an aerial 4 seconds later you'll find yourself nowhere near the ball and being teleported across the map into the other opponents goal. I have tested multiple different internet providers and locations within my State but the issue still persists. I will be willing to change this review if the issue is resolved. Although this is the only negative its a pretty big factor regarding overall gameplay"

,Not Recommended,252950,28302426,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,Daeburon,"im giving this a (hopefully temporary) thumbs down.the latest patch really screwed the pooch. the latest patch was supposed to introduce an ""arena preferences"" feature, so you could play less of the maps you dislike, and more of the ones you like. first, you can only thumbs down two maps, and many players have several they dislike. second, the likes and dislikes dont even seem to work, you still get put into maps you dont like very often, probably more than before. finally, they also added the ""labs"" (experimental) maps to the standard queue. these maps are really different with many problems, and now players are forced to queue into them. (edit: Psyonix removed the labs maps for now, to fix a bug with them being selected too often, but said they will put them back when the bug is fixed)so, instead of actually playing more of the maps you like and less of the ones you dont, its become the opposite, literally. total fail. if/when this is fixed, i will change the review.edit: the following maps are not part of labs maps, but are still in ranked and standard, and you will get queued for them even if you dislike them, hate them, never want to play them:Aquadome: I run this map fine, but many players report poor fps on this map, even if other maps get very good FPS. Psyonix said they improved it, but some still have problems. This map is way too ""busy"" in appearance and is resource heavy. too many polygons and animations going on.Starbase ARC: also way to ""busy"" in appearance, with poor color choices. ball blends in with background, small boost pads are hard too see.Tokyo: Probably the most hated map in the game. too narrow, doesnt flow well, has the most annoying ledges on the sides that make the map not fun. it doesnt matter if you dislike the map, the game will queue you for it anyways. if you leave the map in ranked, you will get a temp ban, if you leave in unranked, you lose MMR.other than the issue of being forced to queue for maps you dont want to play on, this game is amazing, and easily GOTY of 2016, in my opinion."

,Recommended,252950,22442544,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,Orion0091,"Rocket league is a deceptively simple combination of soccer and cars with rockets on them. In the game, players participate in matches of up to 8 people. The objective remains to have more goals than your opponent(s). There are no other rules, so hitting players out of the way and even demolishing them are both valid methods of scoring. Matches last for 5 minutes. If neither team gets more goals than the other, overtime will be initiated, during which the timer is lost altogether and players play indefinitely until a goal is scored. Those are the basics of the game.In terms of presentation, this game meets expectations. The graphics are pretty good, the car models have good detail and can even be given different textures, the backgrounds have enough detail to clearly set them apart from other stages, and the framerate is just fine(based on how long I've played). Overall, this game does a fine job of making itself look good. There isn't anything ground-breaking here, but it's more than enough for a ""sports"" game.When it comes to soundtracks, this game doesn't have one. There's absolutely no music during matches, save for a few stadiums where a 5-second music clip may be played when a goal is scored. The only place with actual music is the main menu, but it's acceptable since few sports games have in-game music to begin with. Most of the time, you'll be accompanied by the sound of your car's revving engine.The gameplay is where most games shine, and Rocket League is no exception. This game maintains ""easy to play-hard to master"" gameplay. The cars are capable of jumping, flipping, drifting and boosting across the field. The walls are sloped, allowing for the cars to drive up them without falling. Cars will flip and boost to hit the ball as quickly and powerfully as possible. The game will reward you with points for executing tasks, such as centering the ball for a teammate, taking a shot on goal, and defending your goal. The matches tend to be rather fast-paced, and the ball will shift sides frequently. Gratification for doing something well is instant, as centering the ball or taking a fast shot will commonly result in a goal. By far the most interesting and nuanced aspect of this game is the boost. Cars can accumulate boost by driving over pads scattered across the field. Players can expend this boost to speed up greatly, allowing them to make powerful shots and demolish other cars by driving into them. Additionally, the boost is used for sending your car into the air to meet the ball, known as an ""aerial"". Aerials can lead to some amazing goals and can often     give a huge advantage to players that execute them well, although they are quite difficult and time-consuming to learn. Players will find some pretty impressive maneuvers as they play, which only adds to the depth of this game. Overall, the gameplay is magnificent.The game has one more major aspect that needs to be addressed: customization. Players can equip their cars with toppers, paint jobs, flags, wheels, and boost trails that can make their cars look unique. There are also different cars themselves, which alter the overall look and the hitboxes slightly. The customization is vast, and allows for much choice. Adittionally, this game has DLC which includes the DeLorean from Back to the Future, two cars based on the Fast and Furious movies, the Batmobile, DLC based on the Mad Max series and other original DLC packs that include car types and accessories.In conclusion, this game is well worth $20 and is a unique experience regardless of whether or not you like ""sports"" games.TL;DR: IZZ GUD BUY IT M99"

The gameplay is in a nutshell 2 teams of up to 4 players competting to score the most goals beforethe match ends using adorable rc cars wth rocket boosters. The soundtrack is good graphics look nice and it has lots of different maps to play on. However the maps are only different in the background (no traps or anything like that) there are some glitches in the game like being able to actually leave the arena and explore infinity and beeyond :/ . If you are a new player and want to get good fast the game has a good amount of tutorials for you to learn and practice, there are 3 difficulties to each practice rookie,pro and allstar each one is increasingly harder. the games focus is on multiplayer (wich is really good) but if you want a singleplayer experience you can play exhibition (create your own game ai or players ,choose maps etc and choose mutators) or you can play seasons wich is basicallya tournament (singleplayer) beetwen your team and a bunch of other teams (ai) you play a certain amount of  rounds until the teams with the most wins compete in the finals whoever wins wins the seeason and the game. There is an impressive amount of customazation (however ya spell it) in the game, mostly for your. you can choose what flags,toopers,color paterns etc you want on your car. splitscreen is supported in this game and all game modes are customazable. this game is true gem in all of gaming and if you like sports games this is a must ownVerdict 10/10 Amazing!"

Nevertheless it's worth reiterating.Rocket League is phenomenal.I first caught wind of it watching a WarOwl video of him having fun with it and instantly knew it was gonna be a hit. Polished, saturated but comical visuals. Wonky but balanced physics. Great online community and support from developers. A perfect example of a product that was released only once it had achieved that level of polish that would ensure it became a hit.I'm only 10 hours in so I have a long ways to go before I master flying boosts, timing, positioning and maybe making a sucessful save every once in awhile.

The concept is simple: it's soccer with cars. It feels more like an action game in the way that you must drive fast and even furiously to make spectacular saves and humiliating goals. It takes a while to develop strategies and learn the basics, but it is so satisfying to singlehandedly run the ball down the field and slam it into the goal in the rival team's face. Getting a new customization after every match whether win or lose keeps me coming back because even though I suck, I at least get a new hat to put on my rocket-propelled car.One aspect that is particularly nice is that players are typically very nice. Limited communication options help keep toxicity to a minimum while still allowing players to communicate with a simple to use chat function.Rocket League is argueably the most fun and perhaps the most rewarding gaming experience I've had this year, so definitely pick it up when you see it on sale. Plus, there's DLC to drive the friggin' Delorean from Back to the Future. How could you say no?"

The gameplay is soccer, played by controlling a car with a double jump and a rocket booster. The game is a sequel to a lesser-known game on the Playstation 3 called Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. I played a ton of the first game, and this game improves upon it in almost every way. The only thing that is weaker in this game is that Rocket League currently does not have different types of arenas to play in. The developers have mentioned that they will release maps in the future that differ from the normal arenas. For example, the first game had a completely circular field with a tunnel on one side that served as the goal. These types of maps added to my enjoyment of the first game, but as I said, there are supposedly plans to bring them to this game as well.

At first, it's a hell of a lot of fun and can challenge you in a unique way that you may never have thought before. Eventually you will find that the challenge is to master the art of flying in the air to hit the ball, and if you're lucky, an aerial goal.This is one of those games that does not have a lot of things to do but you will want to return anyway. It has a decent match-making system to pair you up with like-skilled players. Updates come out every few weeks or so. The game looks amazing and plays well, even if you're using the keyboard and mouse (Get a controller. Seriously.)Pick this game up, it's a hell of a lot of fun especially with your friends."

Because playing with people on the PS4 is a unique experiance.It's well optimized and potato computers like mine can get a good 40 fps.

But by centring a straightforward vehicle-based football game around a floaty physics system, you have the ideal mix of accessible and complex gameplay. While each match sees you try and complete the same objective - getting that ball into the opposing team's goal by any means necessary - the endless amount of possible variables within these heated battles makes for plenty 'ooh' and 'aah' moments. While successfully executing new techniques and tactics can be exciting, it is equally satisfactory to accidentally net a fluke goal from across the pitch. A thoroughly enjoyable game that is well worth its price tag."

When you charge down the pitch and take that shot if feels like you did it, not like you hit a button and a little computer guy did it. Its also hands down the most fun I've had playing multiplayer in years, the matches are quick enough that a bad matchup doesn't plague you for long a new match is coming in 5 short minutes, and every session I play, even with internet randoms nets me a few good games.It also runs great, has a sizable community and matchmaking is really fast, you rarely wait more than a minute or two.

For example some shooter games have football in it where you can stab each other with a knife and have to actually hit the ball with the knife to keep it rolling.They were often silly mini-games and lacked a community since players were busy with the main part of those sorta games.Rocket league however has that silly football/soccer gametype as the main gametype and it is bloody glorious.Sure the AI is beyond crap but it's way more fun to play with/against other players anyway.  It's sheer silly fun in which you often can't stop playing until you turn into a total zombie...a happy zombie at that haha.The fun thing is that this game is even pretty competitive outside of the silly nature, in 2v2/3v3/4v4 matches it can really take quite some skill to beat good opponents and the skill-level will surely increase over time.I hope this game gets updated a lot in the future but even the state it's currently in is already very entertaining."

It takes you back to learning a game when you're a kid. When you first start you're terrible and the games are silly and you score on yourself, but there is a massively high skillcap (GO WATCH A MONTAGE). The most important thing IMO is how often Psyonix releases these dank updates where they really are listening to the correct issues from the players. The new map is really simple and doesnt bog down your machine. They're trying new ranked bracket ideas. They give you tons of free goodies to put on your car and a few cheap cars if you want to spend extra. This is really great and I'm glad they are being inovative and listening to our feedback, but none of this matters if you're building on a weak set of game mechanics. I've made it to the highest ranked division (other than top 100) on this game and I still feel like I have a lot to learn.

I like that you don't need to be a pro to be good at this game, as the fact i was able to jump straight in without being a burden to my team felt awesome. I do have a couple of suggestions though. AI units are... not exactly... great. i mean, for a team based game, the AI's do surprisingly little ""teamwork"". they literally just hit the ball as hard as they can in god-knows what direction and hope to get lucky, but I know the game gets updated fairly often, so of course, that can always be changed or something. Also, this is only minor, but it would be awesome if we could save separate customs to different colours of the same car (eg: blue team paladin has the wings decal and a different trail, antenna, and topper, while orange team paladin has the stars decal and a different antenna, trail and topper, so depending on what team you are placed in, you'll get one of your different customs.)This game is absolutely amazing, and runs (and still looks good!) on surprisingly low specs. Good job, Psyonix, this is a musthave for anyone that likes rockets, cars, soccer, balls, hitting stuff, explosions, teamwork, and the future of eSports.tl;dr - Awesome, fastpaced racing/sports mashup that anyone can jump into and enjoy.

Yep its that crazy of a game.Matches are really quick and intense, action never stops. Zero downtime...finds next match really fast.Cross platform play with ps4( no party invites yet cross platform) but it does help make the matches fill up. More games need to take notice.Season mode for single player with bots is actually enjoyable. Not many games pull that off.Split screen.Amazing price point on Steam and as of writing free on ps4 with plus.A true sport for gamers. If this isnt an Esport....what is?My only wish is in the future we could see larger than 4v4 matches. Seems like it would be perfect 8v8.9/10"

Got this game when it first came out on PS4 as the free game of the month (no money spent). I play it far more than any other game I own, so much so that I bought it for PC. I own all DLC on PS4 and some DLC on here. Anyways.Pros:- Not pay to win at all- It's extremely addictive (high replay value)- The community is nice most of the time- Button Re-mapping- Many different adjustable settings for the in-game camera (Height, Depth of view, Distance, etc.)Cons:- Passive-aggressive chat spamming gets annoying (What a Save!, Wow!, Wow!, Wow!)...that's pretty much it.

The matchmaking mechanic still needs more work and they should tweak the party mechanic to make it a little easier.  Right now the only way I could find add friends to your game was through steam which was a bit clunky.  The other thing that I couldn't find is a way to have your party of two join a 3v3 or 4v4 online game instead of always just the 2v2.  I tried it with a friend who had just got the game and we got clobbered 2v2 every time...lol  So either play with friends who have some experience or avoid the party thing unless you want to loose every game.  Great little game though and very addictive.

The game is highly addicting, and also frustrating..if you have a terrible team, or you're terrible as well. I consider myself alright, but the intense moments is what makes this game great. Trying so hard to pull off a cool pass, or even an epic goal only to fail horribly and let the other team score. I can't tell you how many times I've actually scored for the opposite team, it's embarrassing. I love this game though, and I haven't even had it for a 3 months yet.

With many people to play with for multiplayer whether it's a pal or family next to you, Steam friends and even those playing on the PS4 thanks to crossplay, there is no shortage of people to play with. Unfortunatly server issues still exists but when it's fully fixed, the multiplayer will be amazing.

Such a simple game but yet so brilliant. Awesome fun time with friends. Even in the current 14hrs I have when writing this review I can see that its an amazing game.Good points:-Simple, yet fun-Hats-Good graphics (Unreal engine)-Good physics for an arcade game-Plenty of customization options to make your car stand out-Devs are consistant with updates adding new things like different arenas/game types-Loading times are quick and the servers seem very good, no connection issues yet-Soundtrack is really goodBad points: (really had to nit pick to find bad points)-Hate your friends when they steal your goal-Could do with a little bit more to the progression other than just customization, but I'm ok with this-Maybe more vehicles could also be added, in the 14hrs I've played I've already unlocked all the cars (other than DLC)-The game is also heavily controller based, I haven't personally tried playing with the keyboard, but I'm guessing it probably wont be easy-Everyone who plays online are extreamly salty, even if you are loosing by one goal all your team leaves, this is by no way the games fault, just the stupid people of the earthThis is one of those games that is really easy to pick up and play, but harder to master. The replayability of the game is also good, found myself always jumping on just for a quick game to then find myself playing 5-6.So yeah, buy the game, play with friends, have a lot of fun..."

,Recommended,252950,19104478,"Posted: 15 November, 2015",all,Vissari,"UPDATE: Rocket League has since added plenty of additional modes and ranked features that make this game an absolute necessecity for any gamer out there, experienced or otherwise.To put the base concept of Rocket League out there, it’s a simplified version of soccer involving up to 8 total players driving rocket powered RC cars. You pick up boost on the field, launch yourself in the air, and drive up the side walls, it’s a casual, simplifield take on the soccer experience. However, it is absolutely astounding how much the game will grab you, and how exhilirating it is to expereince the chaoticness that can happen. How much this basic concept has such strong legs that the game is able to get away with a lack of features compared to other sports games. It hardly needs them. That’s not to say the game lacks features at all. For starters, you have 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 standard modes, all of which can feel significantly different when it comes to field control, and teamplay. There’s ranked modes as well, but these are far more limited, you have 1v1, ranked duo 2v2, and solo 3v3. A game like this is definitely needs ranked 3v3 teams and possibly 4v4 teams, but don’t worry lads, within 2 days of release, the game was picked up by ESL. In fact, the first EU cup for the game is taking place today, including, and I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, a team named PlsHaveMercy going against No Mercy. I know who my money is on.Outside of the online play, you have an exhibition mode for quick games against bots, a season mode, drills to hone your skills, a replay mode to edit your favorite victories together, and your garage to customize your cars. You unlock parts as you play such as new tires, cars, paint, decals, boost trails, and hats (you didn’t think you could get away from hats could you?) that you earn nearly every game from playing. The customization is a nice touch, but the majority of time you will be playing this game will mostly be online, going to the garage inbetween matches. That isn’t to say you will never stop playing online, since the game’s servers can occasionally be extremely laggy, but to be fair, there’s good reason for this.On Tuesday, Rocket League launched for $20 on PC, of you have PS+ on PS4, you can play it for free right now, add in Twitch and you had a game that went from 0 players to over 120,000 players in just a couple of days, completely overwhelming the developers expectations, and thus their twitter, their forums, and of course their servers, leading to some significant outages. The game has completely taken over twitch, and is now the one of the top sellers on steam. What myself, and many others will be wondering, is the lasting power of this game. It has significant potential to be a big esports title despite its casual nature. But current lack of support for ranked 3v3 or 4v4 teams is a pretty major disappointment. We will have to see what the developer does down the line, their new found popularity is bound to have some development changes outside of the already announced customization DLC.I know the sports genre is a tough sell on PC, probably the most difficult, but few will be disappointed in the gameplay that Rocket League offers. It’s highly addictive gameplay has already been noted by many, and ESL’s presence will soon spread its way over to PC. Today’s tournament is PS4 exclusive, but PC support and tournaments will soon be making its way to PC, and yes, Deadly Gaming will be competing. Calling now, we’re not gonna be a squad, we’re gonna be Team Rocket.8/10"

It wasn't until recently, that I got queued against players with much higher ranks then I have. Following that, I got annihilated by them which let me put the game aside for a while.

If you are experiencing high ping, don't even try to play it. The game behaves really strange (ball glitches around, player moves left and right completely random etc.), like nothing I have seen so far.Pros:+ Fun to play+ Fluent gameplay+ Graphics+ Price+ Matches are short (7-8 minutes)Cons:- Matchmaking system- Microtransactions"

First may I say that the game is a very different experience when you play with a different skill group. Starting off from most shots being taken off the ground, to crazy aerial shots being taken. The more you play, the more you will become better. There is dlc, addons, etc, but it hardly has an effect on the gameplay. It's mostly for looks, or if your just collecting all of the battle cars/decals. The community (for the most part) is friendly, but a few times you could run into somebody who has a bit of a ""character"", but thats any online game. Personally, this game is really good, and i would rate it 9/10."

You can be casual or competitive, and the gameplay is fun and addictive. Microtransactions are for cosmetics, and the one issue I have with that is how addictive it is to buy them. The cosmetics come in 2 ways - DLC packs that include cars and a few rocket trails, or crates that work similar to the loot boxes in Overwatch. However, you earn these crates at random and have to purchase keys to open them. Cosmetics in the crates can range from wheels, to animated decals, to rocket trails, and more.

The price is great and worth every pennie. The game seems to get a little repetitive after about 10 matches, but only when you are playing by yourself online. With friends everything changes and just having friends to play with makes the experience so much better. The game even supports 2 player splitscreen which we barely ever see on PC.

It's fairly easy to pick up and it has so many different ways of playing(online, with friends, with bots, freeplay, etc) you’re bound to find one you like. There are lots of unlockables to customize your car and plenty of steam achievements to keep you busy, which is a huge plus for me.

Even -I- was interested.A friend of mine got the game and showed me a little bit of it and I was like ""Omg, I want that game.""I ended up getting it and fell in love with it. I was up till almost midnight playing this game and gradually getting better and better at it. I'm currently a lvl 10 after 4 hours of playing the game.I don't know if that's good for 4 hours but I will take it. The game is generous with unlocking stuff and has plenty of DLC.

Moments of complete awe and wonder as to how you got that goal, it will fill you with focus and confidence. You'll start learning how to hit the ball off the wall and then you'll start experimenting with aerial and maybe even driving backwards! Sometimes you might like to drive slow and dance around some players to make them rage quit. There will also be dire moments of frustration, complete madness, screaming, throwing things, smashing walls, breaking mice, keyboards, keyboard trays, desks, monitors, headphones, fish tanks and finally, limbs. This is type of game that really sets the bar when its comes to REAL competitive gameplay that is well structured and utilizes a simple preset chat system that can help you rub in that goal you got, or make you feel like a complete fool! 14 keyboards down and counting!The graphics are amazing, the physics engine is top notch and the game is virtually bug free! I've never played such a well made game in such a long time.My only dislike for this game is with internet connectivity lag issues and server rubberbanding. The rubberbanding has mostly gone away completely now (thanks!). However, if you use a wireless repeater/router to connect to your modem, make sure its faster than 300mbps. The signal likes to fluctuate in strength and it will cause all sorts of terrible input lag in game, ranging from really wide turns, sloppy handling, losing complete control of the car, not being able to time boosting and jumping properly. I recommend this game be played on a network with a wired connection. I've experience much less lag with a wireless network card, but wired is the most stable.P.S...Learn how to be a goalie to get used to aerial so mastering flying is easy.

Netcode will change your position, speed, and orientation if there are lost packets, and replays will show you conveniently swerving to perfectly avoid a block or shot where you where driving completely straight.  The physics are predictable, but only after you learn them; the hitboxes are based on invisible borders that may vary widly from the appearance of the vehicle.  The graphics are nothing to speak of, the music is awful, the statistics are meager, the default controls are not set up well, ""support"" for anything beyond 1920x1080p60 is a lie, and the camera gets locked behind the wall.  Despite all of that, I still play it because it's fun."

There is a certain depth to the game that makes it interesting and fun at teh same time. With this being said the skill cap is very high and I have found that after about 20 hours you can see a marked improvement in your play. If you say this game is bad because you lose all the time, please shut up because it is just a game and if you are losing pick up your game. If you lose, say gg and do better next time. That is the nature of this game. Some nit picky things that will help in large ways: actually hitting the ball, often times players go for the ball and swerve left or right too early but with practice this game be avoided the majority of the time; knowing when to hit the ball when close to either goal, if you are near the enemies goal try to center it for a teamate and if enemies are near your base, use common sense- centering it isnt always the best idea; lastly, use your quick chat, it will allow for better communication as a team and overall better teamwork.If you don't play this game I recommend it and hope I see you in game!"

You unlock a new cosmetic for your car almost every game- you even get free items when a player fails to connect during pregame.

You might be waaaay better than one person that you find online, and then get absolutely destroyed by the next player you play against. You might be able to hit the ball, but a player that is better than you can fly and hit the ball, and a player better than them can do all these crazy things with their car that they never thought was possible, and there are still people better than them! It's absolutely crazy!The only thing that I can think of that would improve this game is introducing more training.

There's a few courses that are really colorful and out there, and some that are basic.  I really love this idea, as it gives you something to look at.  RL has become so popular, and rightfully so.  Thousands of people play this game, and the number increases daily.  The developers are actively working on this game, which plays aHUGEpart in RL's longevity.RL is very simple and easy to pick up.  Keyboard controls are okay, but it's better if you're using a controller, which RL has full support for.

Lets throw in some trick jumps and nitro cars, oh and boosting! Lots and lots of boosting!""So, what is Rocket League? I guess we'll start there.Rocket League is a football racing hybrid game, you are one of up to 8 high flying, boosting nitro cars playing on either Team Blue or Team Orange. Your objective? Put the ball in the back of the goal more times than your opponents, 4v4 is the way to play this game and it is exhilarating to say the least when there are 8 high speed cars rushing for the ball going at who knows how many miles per hour.The control and movement is fantastic, It manages to maintain it's familiar car driving feel but the developers have added a number of features to add to football element which are very easy to pick up and learn, you can jump and flip in any direction to try and intercept any potential enemy goals, you can double tap your jump button dash forward to gain even more speed, you can boost to crash into the opposing team to potentionally take them out of the match for a brief moment, heck you can drive on the cieling if you wanted to! The game will refuse to give you any moment of pause, adding to an even more intense feeling.The graphics I love, it's very bright, cheery and filled with life with abstract patterns and great field designs, ranging from day to night, weather effects, large arenas filled with roaring crowds and wide open grassy pitches, sound design is just as exhilarating as the game itself, the crowd never lets up, the satisfying sound of the ball exploding when a goal is scored and the engines of your cars getting ready to charge to the middle of the arena will make you narrow your eyebrows and grin as you prepare to crash into your opposition.Customisation is a worthy thing to note as well, there are many car bodies, exhaust fumes, patterns, cosmetics and colours for you to pick from to make your nitro striker truly your own and bodies do not come with stats, meaning that you can use the body that YOU want to use, not because it has +5 acceleration. Your customisation will be limiting at first, but there is even more to unlcok by simply playing the game and gaining levels, so replayability? ✓.There is a reason why this game is so popular right now, I rarely write reviews after purchase but I can honestly see this game going places, It's fast, it's fun, it's exhilarating and competitive. Thanks to multi-platform integration with PS4, there'll never be a shortage of people to play! If you are at all on the fence about this, I honestly recommend you give it a try. the value is more than most Triple A titles these days and provided you like cars, football or both, you will have a blast."

Rocket League is a game that has the old school gaming feel where you can just start the game and within seconds be connected to a game, really good for the pick up and play if you dont have much time. Playing by yourself can be dull at time, given that you sometimes may be paired up with people that are too good, or people that like goofing around, which can cause the game to be stressful. When you play competitive this gives you a whole new reason to not fool around and play serious, because the matches and points matter, that is what i mostly play on. Playing with people from your friends list can add a huge amount of fun to the game, because you are playing with them more and more over time and then you start to build that team chemistry, and then the real fun begins. All in all, this game is good when you are pressed for time, but this game can also cut into your other games because this game can be so fun and you constantly will lose track of time.Overall this game is a solid 9/10, for the price point and the hours you can play it is a massive positive and well worth the money. Get it, and go out and get your boost on."

In Player vs AI mode, you compete against up to seven opponents to try to stop your computer-controlled teammates from driving the ball all the way from the enemy goal line straight into your own goal. In Player vs Player mode, helpful mentors within the community will recommend you not play the game at all, because Rocket League-- like fencing and squash-- is a game of elites and a sport of which the underclasses are unworthy. The last game mode is my favorite, in which you peacefully drive around a field alone with the ball for a few minutes while waiting for your audience with the Bronze Ranked Queue House of Lords.10/10 would drive around an empty field alone again"

Then comes the bad side of Rocket League where apparantely the devs thought it's a fair system to put up a really high ranked player and a low ranked player against 2 others that are the same level between those two ranks. Probably the most idiotic logic I've ever seen in my life. The only outcome of that will be that the high ranked player is going to do all the work and carry the ♥♥♥♥ out of the other. This is not fair at all. I've seen people do tricks and♥♥♥♥♥♥that I've never seen before everytime this happens. I'm challenger elite and 75% of my matchmakings consist of a Superstar/Champion (highest blue rank and first purple rank) and then a guy who's prospect elite (highest of silver) And these guys are pretty much a magnet for that ball since 90% of the game it's just the high ranked guy hitting the ball constantly.The devs probably won't do anything about it anyways, they got their money and we got this.In the end, I like playing with friends, but not competitive, it's broken as hell.If you buy it, remember, the competitive is not as fun as it looks like.

Then I saw someone fly up in the air and hit the ball and I realized there was more to this than meets the eye initially. The skill ceiling in this game is ridiculous, as the best player would have to instantly predict the path of the ball when someone hits it AND move into the right position and pull off the shot. 225 hours in I can make some pretty sick shots, but I still am learning and there is still a long ways to go.The early gameplay all takes place on the ground and can feel like a bunch of dogs chasing a car, but as skill/time progresses the strategy seeps in and you can hit the ball higher in the air, from further away. Instead of chasing the ball you know whether to make a play or fall back, and can pull off increasingly better defensive plays and shots/passes.If you get frustrated by having inconsiderate or noob teammates this game will probably frustrate you. Ball chasing teammates can ruin the game, but luckily the games only last 5 minutes and there is unranked play that you can join or leave freely."

The new hockey mode is sweet, and I just can't believe how deep into my gaming rotation it's gotten.  I've played over 900 games (almost entirely online multiplayer), and it's just a blast!  It's become a bigger time burglar than Civ 5, and that says something.  I've been dying for a new PC NHL hockey game, and oddly enough, this has really helped to fill that gap.  The skill level really scales up.  It's simple enough that a 5 year old could pick it up in a matter of minutes, but the skill at the highest levels is pretty spectacular.  This is one of the first game where I've ever befriended strangers to play with.  Thanks Psyonix!UPDATE:  I love they way they are growing the community and the esports.  Rocket League is one of the best sports games on Steam today.  I declare Rocket League to be HappyHappyGameGame's 2015 game of the year (Narrowly defeating GTAV and Fallout 4)"

,Recommended,252950,21746864,"Posted: 10 March, 2016",all,Zeldric,"I was really skeptical about this game as you probably are too. You see it has some great reviews but are still doubting if you will enjoy it or not. You don't think anyone else has the same taste in games or even knows what fun means. This game is pretty addictive which is made even more so if you have people to play it with. You can enjoy this if you are either a casual or a competitive gamer as there is a lot of room for fun, growth and improvement.Besides getting a controller, the best thing you can do for yourself when you start is slow down. This may seem counter productive but don't just hit the ball (unless you have to get it away from your own goal fast). Patience! Take a second for a more precise aim instead of a rushed hit and you'll save a lot of time and make many more goals. Think about where it will go after you hit it and why. Line up your next hit/shot/pass before you even make the first one. A stationary ball will go the direction you hit it but if it's already in motion, spinning or bouncing it will react completely differently.  The hard part isn't hitting the ball; it's making sure you (or a teammate) are ready to hit it again."

,Recommended,252950,17521133,"Posted: 13 August, 2015",all,Mumblesh,"I really enjoy this game, it has an old skool simplicity about it.Object is simple, you just have to get the big ball in the back of the other teams goal, using a vehicle, and that vehicle can wear a hat. You can jump, dash by flipping about, and boost using a limited suppy of replenishable boosty nitro type stuff. The graphics are pretty and controls are nice and tight.Sure I'd like to see some options to tweak weight and gravity (ball and cars) here and there to maybe fine tune things to my liking. And I'd like a bit more custommization of AI behaviour and car stats in general to give them some individuality, but that's just me. It's a tough one, you don't want to unbalance the game by having some vehicles having an advantage over others. But having some with more speed over strength seems like a good way to seperate them, cos' as it stands they all seem the same performance wise except that some are physically bigger, and therefore that may already give them an advantge over the smaller ones all other things being equal.Anywho, this game is fun fluid entertainment, easy to pick up, hard to master, and gets people around the screen in the way games used to years ago... surely a good thing. Maybe you will get a bit tired as there is a lack of different game types/variations. Still it's worth a look.Update: This game has had a lot of developer support since my initial rambling. Some of the in game options I had wanted to see are now available. It has new maps and tweaks and just keeps on getting better."

,Recommended,252950,25473560,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,Nolan Patrick (The Puck),"Okay. So let me start off by disputing something. I bet you're saying, ""You only have 9 hours on this game. You have no right to review it."" Well, I have 9 hours on steam. I've played this game for over 200 hrs. on Xbox One (""How dare you. PC Master Race""). Sorry for breaking one of the 10 commandments in the PC Holy Bible.Review Begins:Now that that's out of the way, we can get into the review. Rocket League is a game of skill. To play this game you will need to invest time. The objective is score goals and win. Yes. Just like soccer/football. In the beginning, you will find yourself struggling to even hit the ball. Later on you will discover this thing called arials (Yes. What you're looking up right now). Maybe you'll even become the next greatest Rocket League Esports player. Just don't go into this game thinking you're automatically going to be the greatest player ever. Obviously I like this game. I've played over 200 hours of it. But will you like it? Probably, considering most people I've asked who've played over 4 hours said they liked it. So let's get into the features of this game.Features:Text chat: This feature is expected in any multiplayer team-based game. Rocket League has it. Do you have time to type? No, since the game has tons of action, but you still do.Voice chat: Another expected feature in any multiplayer team-based game. Rocket League kind of has it. I heard that in their new update (Which I will discuss later in my review) included it. I personally never hear people talking in games. I have occasionally on Xbox but never so far on PC.Skill gap: As I've stated above, this game has a huge skill gap. You are going to get destroyed if you're a rookie (The lowest rank) and you challenge a rocketeer (The highest rank). You need practice. In fact, some nice modders made a mod for this game called Rocket League Trainer. I suggest you check it out if you are going to buy this game.Practice: As mentioned above, you need practice. Rocket League has an in-game practice mode, but it probably won't help you too much, though it will a bit. Like I said, you should take a look at Rocket League Trainer.Cosmetics: This game is filled with cosmetics. Cosmetics are what you unlock for playing the game. The battle cars were meant to be cosmetic, but they all have different stats (such as turning radius). A great beginner car is the octane. Even the pros use it. Even though the stats are slightly different, this game is still a fair 3v3. Nothing is ""Overpowered"" or ""Underpowered.""Flying: You can fly. It's frustrating missing the ball all the time at first, but eventually you'll start hitting it.The Rumble Update:Yes. This is where I'll talk about the new Crate System (Not new to games. Believe me. You've seen it before in CoD and CS:GO).First let's talk about Rumble. Recently, Rumble has been my favorite game mode. In fact, it reminds me of Mario Cart. Rumble is normal Rocket League with powerups. I suggest you look up a video on it. Explaining every detail would take too long.Now for the Crate System. Why? Why Rocket League? Basically, you get crates from playing the game. You get excited. You go to open the crate. You see all the cool items you could get. You try to open it. NOPE! Sorry. You need to buy a key for that. I DON'T WANT A CRATE IF I NEED TO BUY A KEY TO OPEN IT. If they're going to make me buy keys to open crates, why don't they just give me the crates with the keys?This crate system is why Tmartn is going to start playing Rocket League.""But it's all cosmetics. It doesn't effect gameplay."" You're right. But notice the amount of cosmetics that are behind this paywall. There are tons. Also, the quality of cosmetics that are behind the paywall are much better the the quality of those that you get for free, imo. Cosmetics that aren't behind a paywall: Decals. Cosmetics that are behind a paywall: Animated decals.Psyonix, make keys a rare thing to get (I said rare, not impossible) or add a system like the cryptokeys CoD has. Like 20 _____ = 1 key. There. You still get your money from impatient 12 yr. olds with their moms credit card and you make people like me happy.I give this game a 4/5. There was a time that I would give it a 5/5, but with this new crate system, I have to give it a 4/5. Would I recommend Rocket League? Yes, if you can look past the cosmetic paywall."

After a while i started practicing and got better and i realiuzed that after you spend a little bit of time on the game and start thinking about what you are doing rather than just sporadically hitting the ball you will feel so much more achievment. People also say this game gets repetitive, it does. I only experienced repetitiveness during the first 30 hours or so, then i started progressively getting better and i realized that each match has its own different quirks that draw you in such as analyzing car movements and judging where the ball will go, aiming and measuring distances to assist in scoring, and more. Overall i have to say that this game is astounding and its will keep my attention for hours on end and time will fly despite the matches being relatively short, i give this game an 8/10"

Upon buying Rocket League you quickly learn how much depth is featured in this game and the skill required to do different things. Starting the game you have no clue how cars can hit aerials but soon you are in the air to nail the ball into the back of the net. One of the greatest things about Rocket League is that it is a hack-free game. For example, there are no wall hacks or boost hacks or aim hacks that you can get (to my knowledge). This keeps the game very fair. Sadly, this game does have smurfing but I (Challenger 3) run into them every 100 games or so. Even in the lower ranks smurfs are not a problem. This game has a similar feel to Cs : Go in the competitive way due to ranks being awarded completely by skill. Your ever increasing skill gives the player a sense of accomplishment and extraordinary happiness when acquiring a new higher rank. Whether you played SARPBC in the past (which you probably have not) or you are a newcomer to the concept of Rocket Cars playing SocCar, Rocket League has enough depth and enjoyment to keep players coming back for more and more."

,Recommended,252950,22681820,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,Sinishred,"Rocket League is absolutely brilliant.This is a game where teams of three R/C cars attempt to smash a large ball into their opponent's goals. Sounds simple, doesn't it? Yet, the controls and game physics - among other factors - make this game incredibly deep and satisfying. There's no randomly-generated elements in this game; everything is pure skill and nothing but pure skill. Personally, this makes it impossible for me to get angry at a crushing defeat, because I have nobody to blame but myself for failing my team... most of the time, anyways.The vehicles themselves have (relatively) simple controls: accelerate, brake, powerslide/roll, jump, double-jump, and boost. As previously mentioned, the depth comes from the game's mechanics, rather than controls. Every strike of the ball is a split-second calculation: where do I hit the ball to make it bounce in the direction I want? Will an opponent intercept my shot? If I wait, will the ball be stolen from me? Can I reach the ball from here even though its bounced off another player and rolling down the wall? Even boosting must be used cautiously, as you have a limited (but refillable) supply of boost which is burned up rather quickly.The visuals, oddly enough, are better than many Triple-AAA games I've played in recent years. The available options will allow the game to run on most hardware, with some tweaking. I use a relatively powerful machine, so I don't know how well optimized it is, but chances are that framerates will only bottom out on rare and unusual cases.My only real complaints about Rocket League are mostly nitpicks. The vehicle customization options are slightly limited - you cannot customize any of the bodies beyond switching them out entirely, and most vehicles only have seven (sometimes exclusive) paintjobs. And then the movie-based DLC cars can't be customized at all, so you're not allowed to use the DeLorean's boost effects on the Batmobile.WEAK. SAUCE.My second complaint may actually affect the core gameplay - the bots in this game are unhelpful at best. They'll blindly chase the ball with no actual attempts to put the ball in the opponent's goalzone. Considering that they fill in empty slots on unranked multiplayer servers, this can be a real detriment if you get unlucky.In summary: Rocket League is everything that any competetive gamer worth their weight in gold wants from a video game: Chess with Reflexes. And it is beautiful."

Rocket League brings something totally new to the table, soccer with RC cars. Pure Genius.Rocket League is such a simple game to learn but such a hard game to master. There are tons of different moves you can learn how to do and master. It would seem by the idea of hitting a huge ball with an RC car that is all a bunch of randomness but there actually is a method to all this madness. Rocket League also does have a ranking system, there are ranked games and un-ranked games. You also have your own personal level that classifys you as either a Rookie, Semi-Pro, Pro, Veteran, Expert, Master, Legend, and finally the Rocketeer.Rocket League also offers tons of different visual upgrades for your cars thatr you can earn by completing games. There are many different types of bodies to choose from as well as different boost trails, flags, toppers, different types of paints, and decals.Rocket League offers so much content for such a low price and has many different DLC to get also which can improve your experience even more.

Rocket league is a simple, physics based game of skill against other players. It's not so much that you're driving around a car as you are a billiards cue with rockets. There isn't anything to unlock to improve your gameplay, only practice and insight. The cars don't accelerate (though they have different turn radius and hit boxes) differently from one another and the unlocks are all aesthetic. This means that unlike fighting games where characters may have different move sets or quality of gear, or an RTS where you have to micro manage lots of little things to win, Rocket league comes down to who can play the best on truly equal footing (lag excepted)."

And it works, let me tell you. I originally bought the game to mess around with friends on but after the first 50 hours I knew that it had so much more to offer than that. It's skill cieling is so astonishingly high that not even the best in the world have reached it yet. My favorite thing about this game is that new ways to play are constantly being discovered. Unlike in a game like Counter Strike where the only new things you're going to find are a certain place to throw a flashbang or a smoke or something, there's always something new top discover in Rocket League: fast kick-offs, pinching the ball, dribbling, bounce dribbling, power shots, air dragging, half flips, and the list just keeps going. Get this game if you want your life to be sucked away by a seemingly simple, yet endlessly complex masterpiece."

The simple to learn, hard to master mechanics lend it a very realistic feel, and the main con I have so far is in the occasional (reasonably rare but getting more common as time goes on) bad matchmaking. The DLC items are purely cosmetic, and the game is not pay-to-win in any way. The DLC items, IMO, are cool enough to pick up though, despite that. My personal favorite is the Takumi from Supersonic fury, and also the included carbon fiber paint type. This brings up the subject of customization. It is quite varied, even in the base game with no DLC, the only lacking area being the paint types. There are plenty of toppers (Top Hat, anyone?) and the variety of antennas, wheels, boosts, and actual body types are quite good too. The gameplay itself, in writing, sounds like it would get repetitive quickly but, especially when playing with mutators, is always fun and entertaining. This has to be one of the most addicting games I have ever played, if not the most. The gamepad controls are excellent and logical, and are remappable. The keyboard controls are reasonably intuitive, but I personnally vastly prefer the remote for the analogue sticks and triggers. The physics are quite good too, they feel very realistic in mass but the cars handling and boost mechanics are very arcadey, which gives the game an overall arcade feel. I enjoy this game quite a lot and can see myself playing it for quite a long time.EDIT: Why is wasteland in comp? pls no psyonix. Also, I have no idea what people are talking about when they say you need a superboss titan Z i7 5960X origin PC for this to run at max. I use an ancient i7 (averaging around 20-40% usage) and a gtx 960 4 gb (average 50% usage @ 1680x1050) so running it at decent settings shouldnt be hard.Overall- 9/10"

You're able to predict where other players will hit it. You're able to coordinate with a team and adapt to either offensice or defensive.It's extremely team-based... it's soccer after all! Pay attention to the ball's next destination and always anticipate a pass from a teammate. You'll meet people who are very good at the game, and you'll make great friends through it. Whether you play duels, doubles, standard, or anything else, you will have a blast alone or with buddies.Get it! You have nothing to lose!

The best part is that the devs are constantly adding new things to the game such as the ice rink or the upcoming basketball court, all for free too.There are two downsides to RL though.First, there's a map called wasteland. Pretty buggy and kind of disappointed it made it to the competitive (ranked) gamemodes.Secondly, licensed vehicles, e.g. the batmobile, are not customizable. It was only $2, so no biggie, but it would have been nice to  to at least have been able to add a flag.The pros outweigh the cons.

76561198202512084,Recommended,252950,30340490,Posted: 5 March,all,TicTacs,"The idea of rocket-powered cars flipping through the air in Thunderdome-esque matches of cage-soccer sounds like the incoherent ramblings of a madman, but it turns out to be just crazy enough to work. Psyonix’s Rocket League, the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, finds dumb fun in pulling turbocharge-assisted front flips in an ice cream truck, and the white-knuckle strategy in working with your team to control the giant ball on offense and defense. The fast and fluid absurdity of Rocket League fuses into one hell of a good time, despite servers that rarely work perfectly.The main mode puts two teams of three in visually diverse but performance-identical vehicles (though 1v1, 2v2, and 4v4 variants exist) as they race up and down the pitch chasing the league’s oversized equivalent of a soccer ball. The great thing is, you don’t need to know anything about driving games or soccer to play. The rules are simple: drive really fast around bright, glossy, neon colored arenas and do fancy tricks while trying to smash an endlessly ricocheting ball into a deceptively tight space.The heart of Rocket League lives in that feeling of unrestricted movement. It’s thanks in large part to the use of what I would call “physics plus,” where the laws of gravity and momentum get a colorful overhaul to allow for driving on the walls and ceiling, and ridiculous mid-air direction changes that would liquefy the driver in the real world. But its fantastic movement is so arcadey and satisfying that I often have to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the tricks when a simple nudge or bump will do.And those tricks are the first surface-scratching glimpse at Rocket League’s layer of strategy under the ostensibly chaotic mashing of metal. Tapping your jump button puts you in the air, where tapping it again with a direction held performs a somersault, barrel roll, or bicycle kick. It might sound simple – and really, it is – but timing a strike to connect with a speeding ball, and controlling the direction you send it sailing, down to precise angles, takes some skill. There are real, potent levels of satisfaction to be tapped when you see a teammate lining up a shot from the corner and read the situation, slamming on the brakes to nudge the “pass” into the goal with a perfectly timed barrel roll. It’s electric.Outside of the frenzied and intoxicating gameplay, Rocket League has scant few features to flesh out the experience. The player-progression system – where winning matches, performing in-game feats, or doing anything really, earns you experience – unlocks a small stable of goofy cars or cosmetic decals and accessories.It’s fun to drive a truck wearing a sombrero, sure, but because there’s little or no mechanical difference between the dozen or so sportsters, trucks, exotics, a few concept models and at least one ice cream truck (exclusive to PS4 players), there’s no actual sense of progression that changes how you play a match. And while that’s all perfectly justifiable in the name of a level multiplayer playing field, I would have loved to see each car carry the strengths and weaknesses implied by their real-world counterparts: sport cars as speedy but hard-to-handle strikers, trucks and vans as slower but stronger defenders, and the balanced but all-purpose roamers somewhere in between. It seems like a missed opportunity to add a more meaningful connection to your cars in the garage, especially when making a squad to play through an entire season.But there is a separate progression arc found in learning to use the surprising mechanical depth of Rocket League’s many controls and flighty physics. Whether that arc takes you through online competitive or ranked matches, easy-going exhibitions, up to four-player local cooperative play on split-screen, or all 36 weeks of a fully expanded season mode, the Rocket League experience is always about getting into the next throttle-pumping match.And while there are leaderboards to track your statistics and global prowess, Rocket League servers struggle to support the influx of PlayStation 4 and PC players hunting for same and cross-platform matchmaking bouts, rendering most of Rocket League’s online features – including the online party system – spotty at best. Fortunately, the AI is formidable on either difficulty setting above Rookie, both as teammates and opponents, so Rocket League doesn’t lose much in a completely offline existence, which is good, because its online suite is largely unreliable.MY OPINIONRocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds."

It can be difficult to pick up at first, and I really do recommend you do the practice sessions first so you can acquaint yourself with how to move your vehicle around the best way. You'll probably fumble a lot trying to hit the ball at all let alone accurately.The great thing about this game though, is that it's always fun, even if you suck. Playing the game with friends is highly recommended too as it absolutely doubles the fun, and I really like how matchmaking takes parties into account to assure you'll be on the same team as your friends in online play.The one thing that I'll complain about is that the AI can still do really dumb things, even if you're playing at higher skill levels I have seen some bots just casually drive the ball into their own goal for no reason. It can be quite frustrating to play offline if you're essentially carrying your team.I should also mention, that if you're ever starting to get bored of the standard arenas, I highly recommend you try some of the rocket lab arenas to completely change things up. It seems right now that not many people play on them but I promise you they are worth it and demand a whole new strategy and style of play."

,Recommended,252950,17804886,"Posted: 30 August, 2015",all,megacorpse,"So back a few months when I went in to do my learner's liscense test, I went in to my local pet store because obviously, that's where you go for a driver's liscense, and I grabbed the nearest animal, funnily enough it was my grandma, yes, I sold her to the store for enough money to buy the boxed set for rescue heroes seasons 5 to 7, yeah it might be an unpopular opinion but it makes sense because Jake Justice is the coolest guy and he has the most screentime in those seasons. Yeah I was getting off track but I don't think you understand how much this guy means to me. But back to the pet shop, when I saw my grandma in a glass cage labelled ""mongolian gerbil"" I cracked. At that very moment, I started freezing up, but while I was doing that, my mouth was uncontrollably uttering lines from the assembly guide of my personal favourite table from ikea; the Arkelstorp. Now I only like this table more than others like the Feodor chair because it can hold the copious amounts of ice cubes without breaking, I only like ice cubes because this guy I know who sells me my bimonthly subscription to pcgamer sold me a bucket of ice cubes and I got addicted, they're incredibly good, now back to the trigonometry test, I don't remember how to do this, do I need to use the sin function or the cos, I keep forgetting, but I still shouldn't move, because that goose I need for dinner won't stop moving around and looking for food. I need to just keep silent and always have my hunting rifle ready.♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was too loud being nervous waiting for the goose and I ate my learner's liscense test. I just gotta stick my hand into my mouth and trigger a gag reflex. I did that and I actually threw up all over myself and the floor, now this is an extraordinary amount of throwup, it's like a constant stream of sick coming out of my mouth for 20 minutes, at the point where I stopped, I had a small audience and people were throwing money at me to continue. That was when I was actually starting to crack under the pressure of an audience and I started screaming quotes from my favourite wrestler Hulk Hogan, now I wasn't just screaming at the average decibel level which is around 90, I was screaming at around 900 decibels, now at this point, the features of the building I was in started to melt and distort horribly, and in a blink of an eye my eyesight was inverted, and I was in a whole different environment,I was taken to grandpa stromboli's shack where he sold ketamine, which is also known as horse tranquilizer. He sold it because back in the day his good buddy vlad the impaler, he had a copious stash but the grammar police inspected his house and he needed to get rid of it so he left it with grandpa stromboli, but the police weren't police, they were hitmen sent to get rid of him. So my grandpa was going to cut me a deal but I was wearing a macho man shirt, now grandpa wasn't a fan of macho man, so he decided to call my mother, who also disapproved of my macho man and hulk hogan love, but she was a bit more merciful, but under the influence of grape flavoured fanta she was a monster, they forced turkish propaganda onto me, they forced it upon me until I was bloated like a beached whale, this marks my end, but that doesn't stop me from trying to pass my learners liscense. When I was transported to grandpa's shack, they took my learners test and they marked it even though it was only 10% finished, they gave me a fake liscense and they refused any refund and filed a lawsuite agaisnt me for physical abuse on the Vine CEO. So this leaves me in debt to Vine, scammed 50 dollars from the Alberta Liscense Registry Office and in a horrific bloated state, catch me via the hairdryer or channel 16 aka the fireplace channel, I'll be making a cameo around 4 am pst."

I was trying it out on the free-to-play weekend a while back, and was recording for my channel as I had never played it before, and was curious.I played the tutorial, useful to learn the moves, but the real fun begins when you get onto multiplayer.You can customise your car with bits and bats, and it looked pretty swanky. I then played a few rounds, accepting all free addons for my car, and at the end, it looked like a completely new beast.I loved every minute of the game. Sure, there are some die hard players, but that means didly squat when you have 4 rookies racing for the ball, and everyone collides with each other, or end up racing on the ceiling.I even managed a few goals, and that feeling is great. And a backflip is a great move, in my snazzy car until you realise its going to your goal, and.....Anyway, I recommend all to get this game, its very good fun"

,Recommended,252950,16986292,"Posted: 10 July, 2015",all,ProdigyXP,"One of the most fun and addictive games I have ever played. Absolutely a must to play with friends (or even pubs). Single player is fine for learning the mechanics, but multiplayer is where this game shines.Others will explain the details of the game far better than myself, but basically this is a game of soccer (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4) where people are replaced by cars. While the cars can appear different (a lot of cosmetic customizations), they handle identically. You collect boost from highlighted areas on the field that automatically regenerate after a few moments. You can use the boost to give yourself a burst of speed to try and catch up to the play, drive the ball with some extra force, or even blast your car way into the air (some people are amazing at that). You can also jump/hop/flip your car a bit, which can benefit you by giving you a little extra oomph.Once you ge the hang of the basics, the game will start to really come to you. After your first MP goal, you will likely be addicted. The matches are only 5 minutes long, which actually seems like the sweet spot for keeping the games tight and white-knuckled.If you are looking for a fun, relatively inexpensive multiplayer game to play with friends, this will likely scratch that itch for quite a while. Simply put, the game is outstanding fun. Also, due to it being a cross platform game, the amount of players is FAR greater than what Steam will show you. That number just represents the PC crowd. For example Steam was showing around 5600 players during my last game, but there was over 70,000 people playing the game. This should certainly help keep the multiplayer servers active for quite some time."

The team-play and the setups you can make with friends/teammates are unreal. When you score a goal it feels so satisfying as  loud goal horn goes off and the ball explodes blowing everyone back. Making UNREAL saves flying through the air and saving the game for your team feels phenomenal.This game is absolutely worth every cent it's asking for. When I saw this game was only 20 dollars and free on PSN this month, I was astonished. This could easily be charged as a $60 AAA title. Why even play Fifa anymore when you have this. Pick this game up seriously. The devs even say that they plan to make free DLC in the future which is a big plus in many players books.10/10"

The game is easy to learn (rocket-powered cars playing football/soccer), but difficult to master. The different maps and car customizations also add a decent amount of variety. I normally don't like training mode, but this game's training is very help at teaching the angling and timing of hitting the ball. One of the downsides is of course the matchmaking, although that's the case with most games. I often find myself in games across the planet with 200 ping. Also, if your teammates quit because you're losing, they are replaced by the most depressing version of the AI (there are ""rookie""/""pro""/""all-star""), and the rookie AI seems to be for the other team in that it will consistently knock the ball back to your side of the field or even your own goal. The game would be far more balanced if the AI were replaced by ""pro"" versions that actually have some understanding of the game mechanics beyond just aiming for the ball. However, these inconviniences are my only complaints, and they don't detract enough from the quality of the game for me to not recommend it."

I bought it as soon as it came out, after I'd seen Northernlion and Baertaffy play it on YouTube. This was a year ago and I've switched between dota, csgo and this for the last year. It's one of the few games that actually stuck with me.If you haven't already tried it out, it's well worth the price. The gamee is very simple, you drive a car, and try to score a goal on the opponents side of the field. The game focuses mainly on Mulitplayer, so if you're looking for a singleplayer game, this isn't really for you. Playing against bots gets boring quite fast.I'll say a little about why I think the game is fun, and unique, and why I think it's a game almost everyone can enjoy.I think I can compare Rocket League to Counter-strike in a way. The game is easy to learn, but hard to master. You'll play it for about an hour and already know how most things work, but you'll need 100's of hours to get good at it.There are ranked modes, and unranked modes which I love, because it makes the game competetive, or you can just play to goof around with other players. The community is mostly amazing, of course there are some toxic players, but most players are actually quite chill.The developers are the best I've ever seen. Forget about the one's who doesnt listen and takes years to fix bugs and answer at all. Psyonix listens to the community, and will fix whatever we need, in no-time. Seriously, I've been on the subreddit /r/RocketLeague since the game came out, and they've fixed just about every flaw with the game thats been pointed out. They also interract personally with the community, and sometimes they'll answer in a hilarious fashion. You just can't not love the devs.Pros and cons;Pros:-Easy to learn and get into.-Fantastic Community.-Customization for cars, which does not affect gameplay.-A lot of different cars.-Best developers out there, Psyonix is god.-Incredibly fun.-Updated regularly with new maps, cars and customization, and holiday events.-Beautiful graphics, while not in need of an amazing computer.-Feels very smooth, has the option for 144hz refresh rate if needed!-Crossplay between PC/PS4 and PC/Xbox One. (With quickchat visible for both.)-Queueing up for a game usually takes under a minute, even seconds at times.Cons:-Ruined my schoolyear.-Never get to see bugs/glitches, Psyonix fixes them before I get the chance."

DLC is done right i.e. all items are cosmetic - there's no pay to win model. All cars have equal sized hitboxes and equal sized boost capacity. One of the few games where the only difference between winning and losing is skill. There's no theorycrafting, no spreadsheets, no lame stats etc. Just plain fun.The only letdown is that it's a bit of a wild west as far as cheating is concerned. One of the problems I've particularly encountered is what I can best describe as 'multiboxing' as in World of Warcraft where one player controls more than one character simultaneously. Often leads to a very unfair advantage. Also it would be great if there were a feature to report AFK players and offensive player nicks."

The rules are less binding, as are it's physics, but that is what allows for a greater degree of chaotic enjoyment.You can spring your vehicle into a jump, use boosters, and use a bit of the arena to your advantage. There are some customization options for your car, although colors are somewhat limited due to trying to still keep team colors a thing.That is pretty much all you need to know about the core game to dive in.It is a very colorful, vibrant and fun game that's only flaw is one of it's greatest strengths. It's beautifully executed simplistic gamepaly means for an easy to dive into, fun game for some people to blast out a few hours of time, but not enough to create a continued experience or maintain any sense of longevity due to it's basic content.Definately a solid 9/10 game though."

I used to love a game called 'HEAT Online', it was a creative car game with lots of different modes, but it went down not so long ago and I've been keeping my eyes out for a similar game ever since. Car games aren't for everyone, but I'm sure that people who don't like them will definitely enjoy this. It's the perfect game for a lot of light-hearted gamers out there like me who love quick and clever driving mini games. It's simplicity and genius added with high-end, unglitchy finished product programming make this a 10/10 game and definitely one of the best and most fun unique car games in a long long time, it's also very easy and intuitive to learn, especially with a controller... bottom line is; we need more games like this.Shout out to the new driving game 'DISTANCE' too :D it's still in development - you'll probably like it if you like this."

The first hour you play you will be disappointed, sometimes even rage but you get used to the controls very fast. It's a fast moving game that brings out the I really wan't to blow that guy up inside you. But once you get the movments down your addicted. The graphics involved in this game are not out of this world good, but it's a nice transition from Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.  It also dose a nice job of letting you Customize your car even though it's a little strange how you level up and get items. Like when you play a car and get like seven items and not one is for that car. It needs a little work on the interface, it's really all over the place If your not used to it. I also think that there should be more levels for the bots, because when I played first i was winning every time on rookie and then I moved on to pro and I could not even make a goal. Overall the game is a must play and please please don't even try to play this on an old computer I'll save you your time and effort now, I'm am ok player when it comes down to it but I played on a bad computer low graphics and it was baaaaad I could not even make a goal so be warned."

Racing as both a spectator sport and as a gaming genre, is total ballsack, and I would never waste a dime on that kind of junk.For some reason when you rub these two genres together hard enough, you get that magic gaming spark. This is a rewarding, adrenaline-fueled, nitro-boosted hellsport that will make you curse your own lack of skill one minute, and have you almost on your feet cheering for yourself and your buddies the next.Making a car go fast is boring, but learning to make a car jump, juke, and borderline literally fly at the perfect angles to bounce a ball your friend lobbed to you into a goal? Most exciting thing I've done on the internet in a long time.I reccomend playing with at least one friend, and with a controller if possible, cause keyboard and mouse are meh for this one."

I use a 360 controller and it responded well to the input, if it is a tad hard to follow the ball at some points, however there is a handy arrow that points the way at all times.One thing I did find funny was that we played over ten games in a bid to become ranked, and after we won the first game the rest of the games were played against “Pro” and “expert” players. This was quite a difficult feat for us 3 rookies (One of my pals hadn’t joined us), and we were getting our butts kicked 8-0 during these matches.I guess we will get better as we play it more?On a side note I started a single player season to try and improve my skills, and I am having fun on Pro  (but still losing badly)…there are lots of cool car bodies and accessories to unlock and overall this was a fun game to spend some time in with with my friends.Grab it while it’s hot!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OVVnjOfSII&t=1s"

I play with mouse and keyboard and in the beginning its kinda hard to control but you'll get used to it. I find the concept of the game original who would've thought that cars and Football/Soccer would match xD the only downside is the ranking system in Ranked, I find the rank up system not really fair the Elo system would've worked better.

,Recommended,252950,25732086,"Posted: 27 September, 2016",all,NinjaVenom,"Rocket League is, what some would describe it to be, a ""soccar"" game that has you commandeering a vehicle and using it to get a ball into the opponent's goal. It's basically ""Crash Course Football"" in a dystopian setting involving nitrous oxide and rocket jumping.The abilties applied are equivalent to that of an acutal footballer/soccer player, such as ""Bicycle Hit"". It's more simplified from the typical soccer simulators to perform these abilites since you're driving a ball into your oppenent's goal with your car. Because of these simplified mechanics, it allows you to construct even the most spontaneous techniques, making for an intense set of games. But the game is difficult to get used to due to its implementation of physics.The customization options are quite accessorizing. You can select from various different cars, including the DeLorean and Batmobile if you have the DLC, You can alter the colors for the specific teams, and you can also select the fuel trail, wheels, roof accessory and antenna for the car.One of the two special game modes is Hoopz, a basketball version of the game that makes it more challenging and skill-based for the players. This mode pushes you to utilize advanced ablilties in order to put the ball into the hoop. The other mode is Rumble, which involves randomly generated powerups that give you a better advantage of scoring a goal. These powerups include a harpoon, freezing the ball and switching places with your oppenent.In conclusion, this is most definitive form of soccar to play. This game was build from the very concept of soccar and fully executed into a broader experience, giving you addtional ways to play. Despite struggling with it at fiirst, this game will be the most fun you'll ever have with friends."

(I mean..as If the title didnt give that away yet).Even though it takes quite a lot of time to really be good at the game, the basics are easy to understand and learn. I mean, at the moment I'm writing this review, I'm 200 hours in and in competitive I'm still stuck in bronze. But the game isnt only about competitive, there are a lot of fun gamemodes which are perfect to play with friends. For example there's the gamemode rumble. Everything is the same as the normal game..but with powerups like tornadoes, boosts, and magnets. Perfect to play with friends!Then we have the music..which just perfectly fits the game, its soooo good. 10/10 hahaI understand rocket league might not be a game for everyone, but I really enjoy it, so I would rate it a 9/10."

If not, stop reading and go watch one now!  If you have then imagine that but at 4 times the speed with cars that can jump and boost to even more ludicrous speeds in an arena where driving on the walls is not only allowed but encouraged!  This game is pure no nonsense balls to the wall fun, whether you like football or not (I don't much like it personally) you will have a lot of fun with this.The handling of the cars of just the right level of arcadey fun that you always feel in control and you very quickly get to grips with the camera which does about as good a job as it can trying to keep up with the ball!   Once you have the basics of the game down there are plenty of tricks you can pull to keep the ball away from the opponents and going toward their goal.  On top of these there is lots of neat car customization which includes the usual decals, flags, wheels and boost smoke colour and of course the hats!  Hey it works for TF2 so why not put a hat on your car :)There are a couple of modes, exhibition and season vs the AI which is the best way to start playing until you start to figure out how stuff works and then there is the online mode.  Whether you play in a random group or with friends the online mode is a lot of fun and will keep you going to many months to come!All in all this is a thorough recommendation from me, football has finally become fun again for me and all it took was cars in hats!"

Out of all my games in my library, this is one of few that earns a spot in my favourites. I may not have a lot of hours in comparison to a lot of other Rocket League fans out there, but Rocket League is my favorite game to play when I am just simply tired and want to chill a little. The concept is genius, it is a proper sequel to Supersonic Arobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars, it is beautiful in terms on the fact it was made on Unreal 3, physics and gameplay is tight and the DLC for this game is cheap, fun and acutally worth the money. More so.Another thing that should be noted is that there is little to no bugs whatsoever.There is only one thing that annoys me and that is the community. The community is not exactly the forgivable type.Now, as I said the game is fun and exciting. What earns it this is the fact that the competitive scene of it is fun, it has a lot of exciting gamemodes and as far as I am aware they are coming with more gamemodes, customization is wide and well done, and the soundtrack. My God the SOUNDTRACK is just amazing. First I thought it was going to have that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FIFA feel, but all the music is composed by proper artists that are not just in it for the money. No matter what your taste of music is, you can actually enjoy it.Overall rating: 8.5/10. In terms of how little the game costs and how much gameplay you get out of it I'd recommend it on its highest. It doesn't matter if you hate football or cars or both even, you will like this game."

That sounds AWESOME!This is probably the idea that you get.This game manages to combine a world-loved sport with fun PhysX and turn it into something even better![10/10]THE PLAYERSSo, after playing (mostly casual), I have made a few conclusions on this game's community.There is literallyNOtoxicity in the community!Even though I usually queue with my 2 other friends, solo queueing is usually not bad.BUT,casual's skill grouping is pretty broken.More often that not, I get grouped with shoddy teammates, most of them who don't speak English.[9/10]THE GAMEPLAYLet me start by saying, you don'tNEEDa controller to comfortably play this.I have played with keyboard and become quite proficient.Teamwork is a necessity in this game, as it is much like REAL soccer.Crossing, stiking, and saving are all things that NEED to happen for success.I suggest playing with other people. In teamspeak with my 2 friends, we are able toeasily coordinate when to cross, strike, and save. We can coordinate who willgo for the ball and who will wait for the ball and who will wait for the strike.The PhysX are pretty accurate in this game, and there are plenty of maneuvors for hittingthat ball into the exact spot you need it. Also found in this game is boost. Boost can becollected in certain spots in the map, in small increments or full charges. Boost is usefulfor outrunning the opponent for that tip in or that open goal save!Each game, lasts about 6 minutes.Gamemodes include 1v1 Duels, 2v2s, 3v3s (in puck (for Winter) or ball) and 4v4 CHAOS.There are a few CHEAP DLCs, which I have yet to try...[10/10]CUSTOMIZATIONThis game has, over 10 billion (10,000,000,000) different customizations for YOUR car.You can change your hat, your  wheels, your paint, and even your car model itself!These are unlocked afterEVERYmatch, win or lose.There are new items added all the time,There are also flags, for countries, teams, and even games![10/10]TL;DRThis game manages to combine a great, fun community, with laughter inducing PhysX, and insane customibility![9.9/10]BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW,  AND IF YOU LIKED THIS GUY, GIVE A THUMBS UP!"

Car customization is great, allowing for a unique player look. It is quick to pick up and it takes time to build up the skill to be great at timing your shots and doing tricks etc. I would say that it is more of a game you would play for half an hour or so rather than long runs as it can get repetitive but it takes time for the novelty to wear off and it is something I seriously recommend playing for a laugh with friends."

This is a very well balanced casual and competitive game with a towering skill ceiling. It has been a real joy to see my skill improve from day one to now over one hundred hours of gameplay. There are a variety of cars to choose from which all behave the same for the most part (there are slight differences in the hitboxes and turn radii afaik) and you can also customize these cars with paint schemes, skins, hats, wheels, and antennas (these do not change car performance). You can choose to play 1v1 up to 4v4 either casually or competitively with a rankings ladder and all of the maps look great but have the same layout (devs have mentioned adding more unusual layouts in the future). I was on the fence about this game for a month or so after release but I am kicking myself for not picking this up earlier. I have played 104 hours and the game hasn't become stale.

Thus the system requirements aren't high, you can run the game on max graphics with a cheap PC as well at least in 60 fps.I won't say anything about the gameplay because you can find all the informations in the ""About the game"" section above this rating.CONTROLLER OR KEYBOARD: The game is more diificult if you play it with keyboard and mouse so I absolutely recommend a controller for the game if you want to feel the real experience.CONS: Actually, I can say only one negative about this game which I think all the game contain. This is the obscenity. But dont worry because these people are not appeared regularly but when they are there in your game they won't use the voice chat in a proper way. But you can mute them so don't worry about this issue.PRICE: I bought the game with some discounts on a lower price but if you play it with your friends this 20€ will worth the price. However VALVE often offers discounts for the game so it doesn't take so much time to get it on a lower price.Well, that was all I wanted to say.

Looks brilliant and isnt hard to run for most, tons of custimizatoin optoins for your car ( Would like to have different colourd teams beside orange and blue but thats me). However I dont like how allot of people are not pointing out its flaws. This game as a sequel is just not as good, yes this game is a sequel to the fantastic but underated SUPER SONIC ACROBATIC ROCKET POWERED BATTLE CARS a title that I really miss but understand the choice of a re name. Not only does that game have more maps WITH DIFFERENT LAYOUTS some good some bad but also loads more single player content. What really got me sturring tho is the fact they are realesing a map from Super sonic and the map has been completely changed in terms of layout WHICH IS WHAT MADE THE MAP FUN. One BS reason some people have given for this decisoin is that rocket league is more of a competitive game and that kind of map would be terrible for competitve play, well you know what they can very easily account for both casual and comepetitve play by including the map with a standard form and  ITS ORIGINAL FORM Like Smash brothers PLUS how is having different map layouts bad for competitive play. But I digress Rocket league is still great game and I reccomend it to anyone, I just hope the success of this game doesnt get to the developers heads. I hope some of you have manged to read it this far, last little notes servers are pretty good now but EU still gets Lag when busy but overall good.

You get pulled in by the magic of a ball, and a rocket-powered shoe-box that is you car, trying to control something that just wants to bounce around. While hell-bound demons try to take it from you, mind.The polish on this game is 1st class. Playing with a controller is magical. I have only purchased a controller because of this game, and boy does it feel good.The skill curve is pretty steep. Some people don't progress past larning how to hit the ball hard. Being teamed up with these people is horrible, as is playing against them, because it will make you play worse. Some people are demon kings who have sold their soul for the ability to shoot the ball across the field into the top portions of your net, glue the ball to any portion of their car, and hit any ball in the air if they so choose to. Playing with these people is like petting a unicorn.Aparently you have to practice a lot to  get that good, but you just have to let Rocket League consume your life, your soul.

It brings together people from console to PC (PC MASTER RACE!).The concept of the game is very unique...Not.There was a game I remember playing about 7 years that was the bae, but glitchy as my mom on steriods. Just the feeling of sucker-punching that big ball right into that net, NEVER BETTER. Also, I adore the fact that you can put hats on your car, AND THEY DONT COST MONEY.

After over 100 hours I still can't explain why I think it's so great, but it's so easy to just jump into and play, that it's become my go to game when nothing else in my library is of interest at the time. It's simple, exciting, challenging and pulling off amazing moves (for my level, I'm hardly championship material) is an amazing feeling and brings me back for more, despite the numerous failed epic moments. Games are populated very well, with people generally at my level to ensure a good game where I'm not too overwhelmed by people of skill levels many times greater than my own. Learning to fly and score goals from an unwieldy rocket powered car is quite honestly one of the best things I've ever experienced in my long gaming career. Could not recommend this game any higher.

It's design is very energetic and it all looks and feels awesome! I am always pumped up and ready to play just from the start screen!  The controls are responsive and the camera is always where you want it with a press of the spacebar, or X button, or whatever you linked it to.  The programming is stable and well written: I never missed a shot and felt like it was the game's fault.  It has a great price! At whatever point you get bored of it, you will already have well gotten your money's worth.  Here is a list describing its replayability:1) It's a sport game...sports are usually like that.2) The better you get, the more fun it is!  No matter your skill level, you can always improve, pulling off aerial tricks that beginners and even intermediates can only dream of!3) You have various achievements and customizations to unlock, if landing slo-mo-worthy goal after goal wasn't enough for you.4) There are many modes and maps to try out. Train up with CPUs, or play with real people quickly and easily to WRECK OR GET WRECKED!! Play normal soccer (if using rocket powered vehicles to play soccer is normal) or play with wacky power-ups that help hide your lack of skill. There's even a Hoops and Hockey mode if you really wanna mix it up!Despite all that though, you willhatethis game when you are losing, or if you are a beginner.  Thats only something to get over and not the game's fault. Just look at me: my die-hard-Rocket League-fan friend had me, a newbie who bought the game mere minutes ago, play with him online with others close to his skill level, while I had a computer that could barely render the training sessions!  It nearly scared me from the game completely, but I got back to my desk, used a better computer (by the way dont worry about framerate issues, an ""ok"" computer can handle it fine, and the options menu is there for a reason), and I practiced against CPUs until I could score a simple goal.  You will need practice, but the servers always put you in matches with people that share your skill level and after some practice it feels SO GOOD to get a GOOOOOOOOAL!!!! and do flips in your opponents face.Pros:That pumping soundtrack is top-notchQuick and easy preset chat phrases for when you dont have time to typeYou dont have to master a bunch of statistics to be a proThe game's so popular, there's always people to play with onlineConsIt takes practice to really enjoy it, but it pays offIts addictiveNotes:Its best with friends over SkypePlaystation controllers make it betterGet it.Rocket Leagueis a 9/10 game that you want in your Steam Library! Or Xbox library. Or PS4 library. Or soon for your Nintendo Switch-- you get the point."

,Recommended,252950,27886432,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,AlexWrench,"It's 3v3 soccer (futsal?) with rocket cars - a match made in heaven. Success depends on a mix of technical skill, reading the opponents, and common sense strategy. At the same time, there's plenty of chaos: nobody can control the ball forever, anyone can put the ball in the goal, and an amazing play can happen at any time. The controls feel great and offer a wide range of motion, riding up walls, high speeds, and even flight...after some practice. Player eliminations (executed by hitting an opponent at full speed) aren't rewarded or condoned in any way by themselves, but sometimes they're exactly what you need to win.Rocket League was my favorite game the month it launched, and it's still getting better every month. It's great alone, online, and even in local multiplayer. Essential Steam."

I've found that as you play the game, you'll master more tricks. I've gotten pretty good in the few (few meaning 58) hours that I've played Rocket League.The developers, Psyonix, are also incredible. They really care about their players and do everything they can to make sure that people are having a great experience. They also charge reasonable prices. No DLC for $40 *Cough* EA *Cough* I thank them for everything they've done, and will do, for us.I'd definitely recommend this game to friends. I've already gotten one friend hooked on Rocket League, and I hope to get a few more on board. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a few goals to score. ;)"

Definitely worth it.10/10 Can't wait to become a competent player."

Play online on Rocket League and make yourself even more embarassed as you can't even control your car to atleast touch the ball... Only hitting your teammates isn't gonna make you feel bad now... Your noob skills will make you wanna kill yourself as you share your fate of losing miserably at an online fps with an online car football/soccer thingy...

Adrenaline boosted gameplay in the tightest of matches and crazy stuff happening on the gamefield. Probably the most efficient euros -> fun -ratio on steam especially when on sale. Most people use controllers and I also recommend using the xbox 360/one/elite or ps3/ps4 controller (the one you are used to or more comfortable with) to play this game. After trying out Xbox elite and Razer Wildcar (xbox) I must say the Wildcat is the best controller so far to play this game. Steamcontroller would be a bit cheaper solution with extra buttons in the back aswell. Wildcat takes it over Elite for me just because of the technology (microswitches) behind the actual buttons."

I hate sports games. I love Rocket League.""  You'll be surprised to hear yourself say the same thing if you're like me and this guy and don't play either related genre to this game. Smooth controls (keyboard or controller), challenging, rewarding, replayability is off the charts (multiplayer), great game for 10 minutes available or 3 hours.  As of now, I've played 180 hours in about 2 months, delightfully taking my freetime instead of plenty of other awesome games that I also want to play, but will have to wait until tomorrow.Good Community 10/10Oh, there's the trolls. Yea, there's the same people you find in any game that allows mics or type-chatting who want to tell you that you're a noob, when they failed last game like you happened to this game, Oh But, you can mute in game mics, you can mute specific player, you can report players, and mostly you'll be ignoring their chats while you push yourself harder to help your team win.  I played a game where a guy scores on his own goal in the first minute, when there's plenty of game left to win. Guy says ""Nope. I quit."" and rage quits. My team couldn't stop laughing at the genius of rages.  Yea, you have that here and there, but my friends list on Steam went from 5 people to 30 from people in 2 months that I've met who love the game, and have a blast playing it together with me, talking smack to each other over mics while trying to beat the other team.  Has taken my community of gaming with friends to another level.Cross Platform 7/10It's pretty cool that they are frontiering cross-platform gaming, but console users have been spared the ability to read your insults or compliments that you type (for better and worse I suppose).Skip eating out a lunch and buy the game, then add me on steam and you can tell me I was right. 10/10"

76561198147136139,Recommended,252950,29784787,Posted: 8 February,all,Rodulf,"By far one of the best games in my library. I recomand trying it out with a controller though. So I will write an in-depth review of this game called Rocket League in wich I spent around 270 hours going trough many ranked leagues.Graphics:Awesome! I'm not looking for graphics in a competitive game which comes with a lot of action so I don't spend that much time looking around but I am satisfied about the looking of the cars which come with soooo many options to pick! Boosts are awesome, decals are awesome (if you can get a animated one OMG IT LOOKS SO GOOD), car models are of all types and affordable that you can get for a really cheap price and you will 100% enjoy!Physics:Collisions and hitboxes can be improved but those are good enough to not have a game breaking impact, you miss a goal because you hit the ball in a wierd possition and it jumps across the map with 10000 kmph but that's ok, it happens :)Once you get the ability to fly you will be so satisfied when you score an aerial goal, omg it's so exciting! All the wall jumps and freestyles that you can do bring so much excitement, only if you try you can jump off your chair! Even after 270 hours I am still learning and enjoying this game!Community:Surprisingly good! Many of the guys that i've met in 1v1's even came with me in a private practice to teach me how to hit an aerial or such, there are often guys that bm you with a ""What a save!"" when you miss, but other than that you are not going to see game after game ""kys"" or flaming non-stop. It's definetly a great community that I love a lot! You can find so many friends that you can play duo's and have fun.Personal enjoyinment: 9/10.I don't know if it's just me but I start winning around 4-5 games in a row, I get in a good division (about 2-3 rank-ups) and after I get matched with a whole new level of experienced players! *and I start dropping ofc*Ranking system can be a little bit improved, you win and lose a lot, 2 wins can get you a division down and 3 wins can get you a division up so in 30 minutes you can even go up a league! (or go down one :))But I love this game, it's 100% worth the 20$ and the DLC's, I just love it and I play it daily."

76561198240549844,Recommended,252950,25645489,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,The Senate,"Rocket League is by far the best competitve multiplayer game I have ever played.One of the many great things about this game is how accessible it is to new players, despite having a very high skill gap. Not only is it very easy to get into, and very addicting, but it is incredibly hard to master. The dilemna between the game being accessible and the game having a high skill ceiling has been handled perfectly. Additionally, there are both casual and ranked playlists, as well as private matches. No matter how casual or hardcore you are as a gamer, there is almost certainly a place for you in this game.The game is also incredibly rewarding, especially during those moments where you make those goals you never thought you would. In gaming, one can only derive satisfaction from achievement if the achievement was difficult to attain. Not too difficult, but not so easy that the sense of accomplishment fades after a few hours. This is another thing that Rocket League has nailed. Dribble goals, double taps, off-the-wall aerials, and freestyle goals (to name a few) are all incredibly satisfying to make.The controls are tight and responsive, and mechanically the game is near flawless. The physics are also very accurate for the most part. Hitting the ball feels satisfying, due to both visual and audible feedback. The sound and graphics are both well done, and serve their purpose well. There is car custimization, as well as player trading and cases. I tend to ignore these things because I'm not big on cosmetics.The game plays faster than most, and can even be chaotic at times. This is something that I enjoy, although I could understand others not appreciating it as much. It is very engaging and hands-on. Matches are only 5 minutes, making it easy to quickly jump into for a game or two.Another thing I believe is commendable is the commitment the developers have shown to continually updating their game. They have introduced several new and fun gamemodes since launch, including Rumble, Hoops, and Mutator Mash Up. All of the new maps and modes are free. It seems that Psyonix is more interested in the overall longetivity and quality of the game than making as much money as possible. The same cannot be said for many triple-A games these days.That's not to say that everything is perfect. There is no shortage of player toxicity in this game, and unfortunately until recently the report system pretty much did not work at all. I am glad to hear that this is slowly changing, though. Also, the game's matchmaking can feel somewhat frustrating at times. There are micro-transactions, although they are much less prevalent than in many other games. They are there, though, so If you hate that kind of thing, keep that in mind.Overall, I cannot overstate how great this game is. I feel confident in saying that if you enjoy completitive multiplayer games at all, you will enjoy this game.I would give numerical rating, but I don't feel that a number can fully capture how high my opinion of this game is."

Some games I play well; I land my aerials and precision shots are spot on. Other games, I almost feel like I'm back at square one, struggeling to get to grips with even the most basic concepts of the game. I guess this could be applied to any competitive skill-based multiplayer game.

It can get a bit repetitive, but if you stream it on Twitch, that knocks the feeling out. Overall, hitting a ball with less weight than a feather with a car that can barely fly is fun, if you can get used to players flying over you and hitting the ball when you're 1 INCH AWAY FROM IT!!

It never grows boring, since you can always change something or play the standard game and rise your skill.The personalisation is huge and you can open chests for even better designs (or just trade with one of your friends or the steam community). In the game itself are enough free decore Items, but it is pretty obvious that the ones you have to pay for are alot better.All in all is the game fun to play in between or for hours at a time, but it is even better when you play with your friends!"

It only takes a single match to understand the mechanics, but it will surely take hundreds of them to become a master. When a game can make its 5 minute matches feel like 30 seconds, you know it is something worth sharing and is something wonderfully created. If you don't at least give this game a try, the only person you are doing harm is yourself; it is that good. When other games on the market fail to meet expectations or completely break on release, it's games like Rocket League that give us all a little hope (albeit the servers on launch), and it's indie developers like Psyonix that deserve all the recognition and credit in the world, so PLEASE!

,Recommended,252950,29496960,Posted: 25 January,all,ushanka,"This game is honestly one of the most fun and original takes on soccer i've ever seen. You can't make this♥♥♥♥♥♥up, it's football with rocket-propelled RC cars. How can that not be fun? It does have a few flaws, but they are barely noticable. The game is quite hard to control with keyboard and mouse though, which really isn't good for a pleb like me with no controller. It's easy to learn but hard to master. The community is not very talkative, but generally friendly and not too toxic. The ELO system is a joke, and as a new player just starting out you get either carried or crushed a lot. However, it gets better the more you play. It's not optimized very well, and runs quite bad even on the lowest settings. The bots also pull down your FPS a lot, so i don't recommend it on small laptops / notebooks. 8/10."

There are wayyyyyyyyyyyy too many children on here cussing each other out and myself for whatever reason they want (probably not all children). Example I say in team chat, ""Don't sit in the goal the entire game, be ready for a play."" Teammate replies with idiot F***face $#!@ head etc. in team and open chat.I enjoy this game a lot but I will quit playing in the middle of a competitive match if my my moral is hindered. I'm 23 but I have anxiety and depression and I don't want to be around the negative language and poor attitude. I play rocket league to relax from the 55 hours I work every week. I play rocket league because it's the only game i'm good at that my friends can't make fun of me for playing badly because I'm better.I have little faith in the ""report player button"" and I am sure, and have witnessed players continue to continue this behavior match after match. Sure I can mute them, but I shouldn't have to. Nobody should have to mute anyone to enjoy a game."

,Recommended,252950,29900187,Posted: 13 February,all,Mariuz,"As a competitive gamer, it's not often I'm able to find a game that continues to be enjoyable while I'm getting getting completely dominated; but Rocket League delivers that perfectly. I've played for almost 400-hours and I have yet to figure out why, exactly, this game is so fun to so many different people from so many walks of life. But whatever the reason, Psyonix has delivered a near-flawless hybrid cross between a Single-Character-Controlled Sports game (Soccer, Hockey, Basketball), a Racing game, a Flying game, and a competitive multiplayer experience.Pros:- Replayability is consistent.- Servers cover /many/ regions. (Most of the world.)- No single Battlecar has a distinct advantage in all fields over every other Battlecar. (There are pros and cons to every Battlecar.)- Battlecar customizability feels endless.- Fun for casual gamers.- Fun for competitive gamers.- Quick 5-minute matches so you aren't forced to risk losing after 45-minutes.- Split-screen playable Local OR Online.- Psyonix listens to players and integrates desired features.- This Pros list could go on and on.Cons:- Not the easiest game to just pick up and play.-- New players may become discouraged by having difficulty hitting the ball at all. (Don't give up! You'll get it down relatively quickly!)- Online players can be incredibly rude (as with any online multiplayer game).- It takes a LOT of time to become a skilled player.- In-game voice chat quality is unbearable. (Most players use third-party VoIP programs to avoid this issue.)It has been years since I've found a game that has me as addicted and dedicated as I am to Psyonix's Rocket League. This is a game I'll be playing for a long, long time.9.5/10EDIT: Paid DLC is not completely cosmetic, as DLC Battlecars have different hitboxes and turn radiuses than base cars. This, however, does not make any paid DLC Battlecar specifically better than base Battlecars. Every Battlecar has its pros and cons between hitboxes and turn radiuses."

For example, I had 2 season matches where my AI teammate scored no less than 2 goals, they weren't accidental tap-ins either they were purposeful dribbles up the pitch to score. - I had to start defending against my own AI team mates! :o"

Who knew that killing other players didn't have to be the only way to compete with video gamers? I love practically everything with this game. Like all my games, I try to collect all that there is to collect and this game has a lot for that. You can customize so much of your rocket vehicle that it should be rare to ever see any two players look alike, unless they're brand new or on the same team. Every mode of the game was enjoyable and unique. The bot games actually helped me get a lot of the achievements that this game has. It's so nice and it felt great every time I unlocked something new for my vehicle(s). Lots of good memories and blood rushing moments happened on this game. Sadly though, I don't like the price of the DLC, the limitation of the color choices when it comes to the to teams, and the fact that there's no consequence for leaving in the middle of a game. Hopefully this game will offer more to unlock and collect other than just new colored versions of the same hats."

I can't say enough positive things about this game.First of all, their development team is impressively active and will reply to the community in a very quick time about questions/bugs and whatnot.Secondly, the game is fun for all skill levels. I had a blast when I first started out even though I was utter garbage. Now that I have over 500 hours in my belt, I have improved dramatically but still have so far to go.Finally, I have made several friends from this game that I would not have made any other way.

It's a fast pace game with absolutely lovely mechanics. Whether you want some action, to have fun or just to relax on your chair (or couch) this a an awesome choice. You will spend a huge amount of time on this game playing, trading or simply using the soundtrack of the main menu as a background of your other activities. I really like the trading system that they've made, because it's different from the one in CS:GO. There are hundreds of ways to customize your car and in order to get some of the rare items you don't need to spend even a cent, because while playing you will get crates and other items which you can trade for something else with other players. So get this game and have a good time with it. 10/10"

In the morning, I have about thirty minutes of me-time before the long day of work begins.So the fact that I use those thirty minutes playing Rocket League should tell you a bit about how awesome a game it really is.Other reviews have accurately said most of the pros of this game, but the big pro for someone as busy as me is twofold: First, there is very little time commitment: you can pick it up for five minutes and put it down. Second, Rocket League is so fun and involved that by the time I've played a couple of games, I feel more awake, energetic, and ready to start the day's work. It's better than coffee, and far better at clearing my head and reducing stress.If you have a lifestyle that requires you to budget your time carefully, and need something high-impact to clear your head, Rocket League is for you.

,Recommended,252950,29429276,Posted: 22 January,all,Myth ` -`,"Rocket league is one of my favorite games for more than a year. I don't play it that much as I used to, but it's still fun to play. I like that RL has many game modes (from hockey, basketball to power-up filled rumble) that makes it interesting to play. It's nice to see that developers make updates frequently, with many new useful features (party chat, vehicle presets). Adding case opening kinda confused me about if it's not too much for this game but if you don't mind that your car isn't super shiny or that you don't have any great  tuning on it, you may not notice that there is a case opening. I like the ranking system in way I see if I'm close to rankup or not. In the end, I think this the best driving competitive game so far."

,Recommended,252950,27718718,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,ionvortex,"Rocket League is one of the most surprisingly good games I've played, and at $20 full-price, also one of the best values.I am not usually into sports or sports games of any kind. I also only casually like to play racing games. So the formula of mixing the two seemed unappealing. But I was in the mood for something different, with so many gams in my collection being FPS, RPGS, or FPS/RPG hybrids. I saw a few reddit memes and I had a few friends playing, so I said 'what the hell' and bought it.And it was an excellent decision. The first thing I noticed when I fired it up and got into a match is how tight the controls are. Sloppy controls and detection could ruin a game like this. In the training levels, you learn that the basics of the game are really easy to learn and difficult to master. Next, I jumped right into some real games, and I've been having a blast ever since. It is a great game to play in short spurts, since each match is only 5:00.It is also a great game to come back to after a while because the creators have been awesome at giving new content, both DLC wise and for free. This is a great model on how a developer should support their game.The two areas I would like to see improvement are in the ball physics, which can be a bit wonky at times, and the match-making system. Match-making doesn't seem perfectly even, and smurfs easily creep in. Also, I do wish they could lock players out of server regions they don't belong to, because these create high-ping matches that are really difficult.Overall though, I can't recommend the game enough.This game is best with:1. An xbox controller (or whatever you have)2. Friends, so you can talk strategy, trash, and enjoy the mayhem together. The community is not that great, so I wouldn't recommend it to a lone wolf who wants to do multi-player.3. An open-mind about what kind of games you like. I never thought I would have gotten into a game that is essentially a variant of soccer, but I did."

I find this game very different from others in one particular way, reward. Sure getting cosmetics is cool and all and you get those win or lose mind you, and yeah you get some cool titles to show off your in game play time, but i think that the real reward is your progression as a player. Going from barely being able to hit a ball and getting lucky goals to being able to fly through the air with only the grace a rocket powered car can portray, and scoring an insane ariel goal is an amazing feeling.Pros:Fairly priced DLCUnlimited Skill capMultitude of game modes and mapsFresh content monthly.Cons:Cases (understandable though they need to make money)Ranked can be janky sometimes"

From the user-friendly interface to the killer sound design, every part of the game shines. But even without all the trappings, the customization, the loot boxes, and the expansions, Rocket League is a sublime experience.The core gameplay is so intuitive and enjoyable that anyone, regardless of their skill level or desired skill level, can pick it up and play, enjoying it immediatley."
