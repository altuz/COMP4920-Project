I purchased the 4 pack and that was also 75% off as well. I gave a copy to a friend and a copy to my son, SO TO LATE for a REFUND now. Then I see the store page after the sale was over, & its the same price as what I had origionally bought the game for WHY? If this is an honest mistake, then I will delete this review in an instant, BUT if not and this is just another scamy sales tactic then ...........................http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=777485595IM REALLY UPSET over this change in pricing, so soon after a sale like this one !  If it was say 1 year later or even 2 years later it would not be so bad, but 1 week :P :(To the Developer & PublisherThank you greatly for the game and the fantastic discount I got ? WELL never really got, because YOU just scamed me for the price and the price NEVER really changed RIGHT? all with in a week from end of sale :PDeveloper: ElefantopiaPublisher: ElefantopiaOK know on a more positive note here, the game is very a nice Tower defense type Strategy game and does play smoothly I love the art the very cute McDROID Robot and the colours Im presented with, with in this game. BUT when all the shooting and action starts from the enemy waves the game starts to lag and stagger for me, not fun when this starts to happen, Son said its my laptop and GPU possibly cant handle the extra load when the action starts. This I really dont understand because other games even RIVE play fantastic with out any issues and many others a s well.Look all I will say is buy at your own risk now, I never really got a 75%off discount NOW did I ??????"

Everything is good, from gameplay, to progression, economy, enemies, ect.Every match you plant seeds in pre-placed seed beds, which produce strawberries, which act as the games currency for buying and upgrading towers. This adds a additional element many tower defense games don't have, as you need to defend your strawberry patches. The other currency is diamonds. Diamonds are gained from certain enemy kills, and are used to buy tower upgrades and special abilities.There is alot of variety with the towers and upgrades, and the game is fun both in single and multi player. There is a limited number of campaign levels, estimated about 5 hours playtime. However there are hardcore and survival versions of almost every level which can ramp up the game time considerably, and are very fun. Playing online is also considerably fun.All in all a great game, worth the money and recommended to tower defense and arcade shooter fans."
,Recommended,252970,24529388,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,Justin_Brett,"So, speaking of outlandish premises, here's another that has that in spades. Is it a better game than Last Hope? I'd say so, and I would recommend it, but with some caveats.The game stars the titular McDroid, who the game refers to as a dog-bot, and his friend a talking shuttle named...Shuttle. They return back to their friend Planet (who is a sentient) after a trip to find thing are a bit different. She's completely silent, mutated creatures are roaming about, and mysterious messages are around from an entity called the Somanto Corporation. You can probably see where this is going, and while I didn't find it too insufferable since you play as machines, the game does have an environmental message.To heal Planet you'll need to heal special flowers to bring her back to the way she was, and to do that you'll need to protect Shuttle from the mutants Somanto's action have let loose. Like Orcs Must Die or Spacejacked you control McDroid and have an avatar in the fights. Unlike other games though, you don't just get money from killing enemies: instead you have to collect seeds strewn across the level or dropped at scripted moments and plant them. They'll sprout strawberries every so often, which you need to grab and bring back to Shuttle. Then you can spend them. Certainly a unique change but not entirely a welcome one, although you do unlock a unit that will do that for you later on in the game.You can spend the berries on turrets, extra health or equipment for McDroid and Shuttle, and...Bonsai trees? The game has a terrain mechanic to it, where you can put trees in the same spots as your towers; they don't do any damage on their own, but spawn greenery in a certain radius. If a turret is in that distance, it deals much more damage. You can only put things in certain spaces, but McDroid has room for at least one turret or plant to carry around with him, so there's a lot of room to experiment.Where it gets tricky is that the enemy has their own terrain, a lavaish field that deals constant damage to anything inside it - this is another game where your towers can get attacked, although thankfully McDroid can repair them by default, and quickly too. Plants can counteract the field, but they sort of cancel each-other out, so it's a good idea to have your turrets get rid of whatever is causing it, usually the corpse of some bigger monster. To do that though you click on it, which distracts them away from anything else, so you need to pick the right time.It might sound like the levels have a lot to keep track of, and you're right. You're almost always on the move in McDroid, whether it's to collect some berries, shoot some debris, or boost your towers. That becomes a pain in certain things, like if you want to upgrade a tower; you need to have him holding the one in question before you can, which is cumbersome at times. To upgrade your kit you also need to personally collect gems that drop from destroying certain things or opening chests. You do get a grace period when the level's over to collect things you missed, and there are a few levels where you need to do other things in addition to surviving all the waves, which ensures you won't get booted out before you can get them all. You can use gems in levels to buy specialty things, such as some helper units that attack enemies for you or extra spaces for turrets and plants.I finished all the main levels in McDroid except for the last one, which almost seems designed for co-op (which the game has), since you have to keep track of things in all four directions. That took me five hours. That's probably the biggest caveat: besides the story levels, there just seems to be more challenging versions of those levels and some endless arena levels. The game's twenty dollars full price, but even at five dollars, which I bought it at, you'd need to really like the game to get much out of it besides the bare minimum. I can't really say it's a bad game, since there does seem to be a lot of effort to put in, and it looks really nice. I might be less pleased with it if I have gotten it at full price, though. If you want a unique game that's a bit imperfect, McDroid could interest you."

Don't let the video or graphics fool you, this game can get really hard quite fast. The fact it also allows co-op on every level is another plus which makes the game that much more fun. I recommend this game to anyone that loves TD's and is looking for a challenge."

Its light hearted, but certainly has some advanced humor.The gameplay is deceptively challenging, with a number of different activities to balance in each level. Should you leave one un-attened for too long, you will quickly find yourself in a pickle.The tutorials are not entirely intuitive, so make sure you look at all the signs! Fortunately the gameplay is starightforward enough that you might not need it, though there is more depth than there appears to be at first glance.I enjoy it, and look forward to playing more with friends!"
,Recommended,252970,12136341,"Posted: 18 September, 2014",all,Gauge,"A very nice and colorful take on tower defense, really feels like a war of push and pull. Very snappy and responsive controls I was not expecting the game to respond so quickly. Nice colorful characters that do not get on your nerves at all. They have a lot of fun with the dialouge which makes the characters endearing... at least for me. Its like running around and gardening as a dog. There is very much something here for both the casual and hardcore players. I recomend you bring a friend for many of the levels it always felt like I could do so much more if i had just a little helping hand. You can't really stand still to admire your grand defense in this, there is always something to do ecouraging you to stay on the move which I like a lot."

76561198010212318,Recommended,252970,12483754,"Posted: 13 October, 2014",all,Bucketoffish,McDroid does something refreshing in the TD genre. This game provides a bright artstyle with adorable enemies.  It reminds me of a better version of Pixeljunk Monsters. I can see the company easily publishing worthwhile DLC since levels offer replay value and there are fairly limited tower options so far.  My only complaint is that it isn't a 60 dollar game with more content.  I haven't played much of the co-op but what I played was fun. I'm very surprised this wasn't pushed on consoles since it would make for some fun couch co-op.

Long story short: You crash-land on a planet and need to refill your strawberry-juice-engine. While planting and harvesting strawberries, you have to keep the ""local population"" away from them and prevent your own destruction, because they bite and shoot.Handling is very easy,Just run, collect and upgrade. Shooting at enemies is done automatically, but you can also choose a primary target by just clicking it. All weapons fire is then focused on that.There are many different weapons and items which will help you doing that.You will find blueprints and diamonds throughout the game to research and upgrade these.Your McDROID has an arm with which it can repair damaged turrets and your shuttle.After you finish a level, the challenge and nightmare mode for that level will become available for more fun.And if a level ist just too tough fou you alone, you can invite friend to help you out. Yes, this game is multi-player.Is it worth the price? Yes. Definitely."

Not really understanding the decision to only allow the droid to pick up a finite number strawberries or gems.....really annoying when you are trying to pick up gems for upgrades but you can't because your guy picked up the strawberries instead.  Also,  Need to maybe make a no kidding tutorial.  I had no clue what was going on other than by pressing buttons and seeing what happened.Good feature is the auto attack while you are running around.  I noticed the hit box is a little unforgiving when human controlled.  Game needs some patching which will surely come as more players check this out.  6/10"

If i am missing something please let me know, but according to it i finished the tree of life and thats pretty much the end. So i payed £13.50 for a few hours of gameplay some which were just painful grinding to get diamonds. i have to compare this to say kingdom rush - £6.99 for  70 hours+ gameplay. in its current state this game is well overpriced.Now deleting!I purchased this with very little to go on, only around 3 reviews at the time of purchase. It's a great game i do however think it is more inclined towards multiplayer if you want to advance at a reasonable pace. I seem to have to be ""grinding"" to get diamonds to unlock upgrades etc in single player. Also the tutorial doesnt really explain things very well and as your thrown in at the deep end ( in single player ) it can seem a little overwhelming, As you realize that your wasting the diamonds you need for upgrades on mines etc, evetually it causes you to play a lot more strategically to save resources for upgrades.Graphically its nicely done and it all plays very well. The only problem i really encountered was whilst i was carrying a turret at one point i seem to become lodged in the ""mother ship"" there seemed no way to free myself and it forced me to restart the level. Also i noticed that trying to traverse the pathway from level to level with the keyboard causes your droid to walk diagonally ( i saw a few people fall off the path - having the same problem ) this problem however doesnt occur with a  controller.All in all a good game with only a couple of minor flaws ( that i have found so far )"

Levels progress slowly, it takes forever to kill enemies, the diamond upgrade system also seems like a grind. The fact that there is a tower on the player just seems gimmicky, and just makes it so you are constantly hovering over enemy’s with your mouse, a brainless activity. I want to like this game but just don't. It may get better, but I don't want to spend time to get there."

Requires plenty of multi-tasking and a steady mouse to keep track of all the moving pieces. I pretty much pick up most tower defense games and this one certainly stands out amongst the many flavors. Note - the game is not easy if you expect to breeze through the levels in short time.I've not tried co-op yet but I read it's one of the selling points also.
