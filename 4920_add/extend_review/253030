After dying by hitting objects in the level you want to play some more so that you can get to the next level. The faster you go the sun actually goes up the sky instead of down.  This game is fun and nerve bending at the same time. I recommend this game for those who like challenging fast pace games that keep you on the edge of your seat."

So addictive that you will keep saying ""one more go"" after smashing against a wall.Race The Sun reminds me of an old flash game that I used to play in College years ago, it was called Tunnel Maze Game and your objective was to dodge and jump obstacles that popped up at you, giving you a split second to react while your character surfed within a tunnel. If you know the game I am talking about then you will enjoy this game.Gameplay wise, not every retry will be the same, meaning you could initially learn a portion of a region and then next try find yourself going a completely different way or into another area. The great thing about this game though is that the world will change every 24 hours, meaning it is forever changing. Not only that but it is user content friendly, meaning you can create and publish your own worlds for others to try.Overall, if you are into games that test your reflexes or you have that determination to try and get a better score or do better than the last try. This game is for you."

Before the sun disappears, your solar craft must make it as far as possible without hitting anything. At the same time, trying to stay in the light & grab as many power-ups, tris or wormholes across the landscape, to boost you along as fast as possible. There's a fantastic sense of speed building up the longer you survive, often flying past objects so close you could touch it(and sometimes mistakenly do lol!).Lighting effects of the sun streaming rays of light through the various shapes of the artifically inspired worlds looks awesome, while also being a key mechanic functionally in the game design!The world is randomly regenerated every 24hrs to provide new challenging combinations, plus in-between there is plenty of community maps to try on the Workshop. There are also specific challenges to level-up & upgrade your default craft to work towards longer term.  Some of these are really hard!Great to play on the big screen(in your lounge room), for a brief daily distraction(since games can be very quick indeed sometimes):) or even a longer session where you reach for the clouds & conquer your(or friends)high scores! There are some tough achievements & a game plus mode for the hardcore out there.Race the Sun is easy to pick up but hard to put down... while always striving for that elusive 'high score' just over the horizon!Menus are a bit strange to navigate with a controller & the bright white tones can overwhelm, but other than these minor factors, this is a top quality & very addictive little indie title!If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"

Race the Sun is not only a fun little addiction but hopefully also a harbinger of the return of boutique developers.If Race The Sun’s tracks remain as consistently well-paced and tiered as the raft of stages we’ve experienced to date, then it can be considered a success rather than an experiment: a confident genre hybrid worthy of your time and patience because who knows, today could be your day.Race the Sun is very close to a perfect pick-up-and-play game, except for the bit where it’s very hard not to keep playing once you’ve started. A quick break easily turns into one more attempt, trying to plot a different course over the cluttered plains, maximizing Tri collection while minimizing the risk of turning into a cloud of debris.An original take on the arcade time-trial formula.Race the Sun is an elegant endeavor, pairing slick action and stiff challenge with systems that make you want to come back day after day."

,Recommended,253030,30659057,Posted: 21 March,all,ErickaUnlimited,"OverviewRace The Sun is an atypical single player racing game that puts you in control of a geometric solar powered craft on a never-ending, futile journey to keep a fully charged battery and keep the sun from setting. As you race towards the always distant sun, you’ll have to circumvent an ever-changing obstacle course and collect power-ups and energy boosts to keep the sun in the sky for as long as you can. Watch out though, as one frontal collision and your run is over and back to the beginning you go.The game itself comes at you from a very minimalist approach, though there’s a bit more to the game at first glance. There’s some real satisfying work that goes into completing it and it really kept me hooked, but Race The Sun suffers from longevity issues which makes leaving a lasting impression on you difficult to master.The main game, as mentioned above, you pilot a winged solar craft through courses that change once every 24hrs. While many of the obstacles will remain similar at first glance, the position at which they come to you, the order and the location of the power-ups will all be different each day. There’s an in-game counter stating when you can expect a new course to play on. This is a wonderful device that keeps the content fresh without having to constantly release DLC content. The game, to an extent, creates it for you.As you proceed through these levels, you’ll be given side challenges that will help level up your craft. These can range from how many icons you collect [called tris], your bonus multiplier, how many power-ups you use and so forth. They are scaled from a simple easy to hard scale and the value of tokens earned is based on that scale. As you level up, you’ll gain new, permanent abilities that you can toggle on and off based on your play style or the type of challenge you’re working on; these range from a magnet to draw in tris, the ability to hold additional powers like shields and jump abilities, a larger battery pack and more.There are no traditional difficulty settings in Race The Sun, but instead different game modes that stand in their place. Your typical playthrough would fall under the “Normal” category, while you can unlock an “apocalypse” mode; the game’s version of “hard”. In juxtaposition to those, there is also a casual mode with no sun that allows you to just play the game in a stress free environment, as well as a top-down version.I never ran into many problems while playing. There were some instances of FPS drops that were really irritating on such a minimalist game; a few times it cost me my run. They didn’t stop me from playing, but it wasn’t a problem I was ever able to locate and fix either. The only other issue I have with the game was the difficulty spike between normal runs and the heightened “apocalypse” mode. I consider myself a junkie for difficulty, but even as I learned the ins and outs of the courses and their routines, it felt far too scaled upward to remain as enjoyable. I found myself completely ignoring this aspect of the game, which is a shame.The height of the game’s enjoyment came, for me, with doing the in-game challenges. However, once you fully level up your craft you no longer have a list to work on, making the game fall back on just racing the sun. While fun, there felt like a chunk of purpose was removed from the game when I had nothing else to strive for other than my own personal record. That nearly tangible feeling of excitement vanished just like the challenges did. Aside from the Steam achievements, I no longer had a reason to keep playing…so I didn’t. I wish I had a reason to go back.ProsA great test of reflexes and skill if you enjoy racing-type games.Friendly UI setup.Easy to drop in and out of for short or long sessions.Lovely art style with a good use of colors and B&W canvases.There is a level editor, though it takes some practice.ConsThere are instances of FPS drops for some users.Lacks a proper end game to keep user presence and longevity.The “apocalypse” setting can be daunting for some users with no way to adjust it.Overall, I really enjoyed Race The Sun. The simplicity in its design balanced out the sharp difficulty curve as you learned to play the game. It balanced it’s color scheme and rigged layout with splashes of color and smooth [for the most part] gameplay. While I wish there was more to keep me going back, I enjoyed every minute of it."

And when I say it's addictive I don't mean, ""oh what a nice little game, I'll play for a few minutes then get on with my day...""  No, it's more like the kind of addiction that grabs you instantly and never lets go.  I'd say it's impossible to play, ""just one round.""  No no.... you'll be like oh man I gotta do that again, I know I can do it better.  Wait wait... I know where I screwed up just one more round.  Oh man, I can't let that stop me.  Just a little more.""But DJ so what if it's addictive it just looks like a silly time waster and I can find those for free.""  Once again your dead wrong.  What the game lacks in graphics it more than double makes up for in gameplay.  It's a racing game that gives you just as much thrills and spills as any racing game out there.  It's a game of dodging stuff that will leave you holding your breath as you narrowly miss that wall with a feeling of relief when you do.  It's a game to challenge you to beat your friends high scores that's just as enjoyable to achieve as the best competitive multiplayer game out there.  It's a game about change as each new day brings a new map to challenge your friends to.  It's a creators paradise where you can create maps and challenges for all your friends and community.  Belive me when I say, this game is a whole lot more than it looks.You honestly can't go wrong adding this gem of a game to your game library.  Buy it when it's cheap, but even at $10.00 I'd still say it's more than worth it.  It'll be your best spent money all week."

,Recommended,253030,8015743,"Posted: 12 December, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"Race The Sun is one of those endless runners we've seen hundreds of times before on our mobile phones. But we've rarely seen one appear on Steam. It's because Race The Sun is stylish, fun and addictive, and not necessarily in that order.You basically steer a ship across a randomly generated world with tons of objects to avoid and power-ups to collect.It's fast paced and objective based. Well, it's not required, really, but it helps you upgrade your ship later on and might make your life a little easier. There are always 3 random objectives to complete, and with each objective you complete you'll earn 1 (easy objective) to 3 (harder objective) upgrade points. Upgrades can be a higher multiplier right from the start or the ability to store 2 power-ups instead of 1.While racing you have to collect yellow power-ups to keep raising the sun. Your ship is energy powered and staying in the shadows for too long will slow you down, resulting in a lower score (because, obviously, you can't collect items as quickly anymore). And if the sun goes down it's game over, too.In the end I was pleasantly surprised by Race The Sun. I grew tired of endless runners a long time ago, but the combination of random worlds, power-ups and objectives make this game feel fresh somehow. Praise the sun ![Rating: 78/100]"

Runs at high quality on the integrated graphics of a laptop; if you tote around one with a dedicated GPU, you don't even need to turn it on - you can play on-the-go without burning through your battery.Even though sometimes you want the next map to just roll around already, I think the decision to rotate them once every day is very spot-on. It forces you to just relax, pull back a bit, and remember that games should be played in moderation."

I highly recommend focusing on hitting max level before considering to do anything else, also since you'll get to experience the most optimized way to play the game.You get one seed to play with per 24h with its own leaderboards, which is fine, since the game's concept is early route planning and endless avoidance with quick decisions on your feet.The maps have set patterns, so even if you're not that great at video games, you can still memorize them and act on instinct after you get familiar enough.Overall a great game, good experience, would recommend to everyone and anyone who looks for both a casual or a challenging experience."

I don't want to say that this game is horrible, but even without my hopes and expectations I had when seing the screens of this game, I am sure that I still wouldn't recommend it. It is just not my cup of tea and I'm going to tell you why...I like racing games, especially the fast and highly unrealistic ones I played in old times. Obviously this game is nothing like that. To be honest, I expected it to be somewhat like StarWing (SNES, 1993), because it almost looks like it. I bought this game, because its ""fast"" gameplay and interesting look seemed promising. Well, this game did not meet my expectation in any way. Please do not get fooled by the screenshots that imply that there is a variety of space themed or interesting levels. Those are temporary warp zones and not even fun ones to play either.At some point this game can be fast, but is it any good when you cannot manouver fast enough to react to certain objects (not even with the steering upgrade)? The controls are extremely limited. You are only able to steer left and right, a button to activate your power-up and that's IT. NO turning your vehicle upside down or sideways to fly through narrow spaces. Actually, you are able to perform an aileron roll (commonly refered to as barrel roll), but it does absolutely nothing besides reminding you of how awesome it would be to quit the game and play a different one. You are not even able to steer your vehicle up or down, while in midair. Even the rare and short space zones cannot be navigated 3Dimensionally. The control settings say that you can map ""up"" and ""down"", but it's only for the menu (what a freakin' joke). You can only jump, which is one of three power-ups. In this game nothing spectacular or exciting will happen, due to limited gameplay features..To be fair, the normal game mode is very easy and to a certain extend fun to play, but if you wanted to go deeper into what the game holds in store for you, you have to play its Apocalypse mode, which except for the beginning of each level is absolutely random and requiers 50% of pure luck and 50% of skill. Besides I really don't want to get started about what's wrong with that game mode and I only want to say that it is frustrating NOT because it's difficult, but because UNPREDICTABLE level elements can ruin a good run instantly with cheap deaths. I mean, of course you get better and learn certein patterns that might repeat and yet still a high share of luck remains. Not even trial and error will get you further, but rather plain patience and multiple runs. For all those achievement hunters out there: obtaining the hardest achievement in the game is not too hard, but it can be so boring that it makes you actually wish for a breath of fresh air outside, watching a real sunset for over an hour, rather than playing this monotonous game. Really, there's not much variety to be discovered in this game. It's just a game with unused potential. I like its cover picture though..."

If you like adrenaline-fueled arcade racing then this might be the game for you. But when I say racing, you aren't really racing oponents - as the name says you are racing the sun. You weave through obstacles at high speed in a solar-powered ship with only limited batteries, and the sun is sinking ever closer to the horizon. How far can you make it before the sun sets?I really enjoy the way the maps work. Each day at a set time the world gets reset; a new set of procedurally generated stages are laid out and are used by everybody for the next 24 hours, with daily leaderboards as well as tracking of all-time high scores.Surpisingly it isn't terrible to play on a keyboard, but a controller is STRONGLY recommended."

Good music, soft color schees.I don't really like low drawdistance and the fact that it renders only 180° in VR.There's also unnecessary progression in this game with upgrades, scores, etc, etc. I blieve it's made to keep people playing, but that's not for me :-("
,Recommended,253030,30439592,Posted: 10 March,all,[LUE] TormakSaber,"You play as an aircraft, powered by the sun, racing through procedurally created regions. The sun is ever setting, and by collecting speed boosts, you can give yourself more time to race the sun through ever more hectic regions. Along the way are other powerups and combo tris to let your score climb ever higher, as long as you can keep up your speed so the sun doesn't set. If the sun goes down, if you drive in shadows, if you bump objects, you slow down, and if you stop, you die. The game can get very intense in later levels as you make hairpin turns on twitch reactions, diving from speed boost to speed boost in a frantic attempt to keep the sun juuuust over the horizon. There's also world portals that will teleport you to user-made levels, some of which are detah traps, and others which are just pure bonus score increasers and will send your score sky high.As you play the game you can unlock challenges that, when completed, will unlock new decals and cosmetics, as well as upgrade the powerups you can get, or let you carry more of them. A new level is generated every 24 hours, so leaderboards are changing constantly, and there's always a new level to try to route yourself through. The game also boasts an extra difficult Apocalypse mode, and a slower, more puzzley Labyrinth mode, for extra challenges. There's also a no-sun-timer DLC available if that's what you're interested in, too.Truth be told, I don't know if the game is worth ten dollars. It's really fun and engaging, and new levels every day encourage constant improvements and score increasing on new leaderboards, but at the end of the day, it really is something that you could play on any old games website with flash games.If you're interested in Endless Runners, and like them, defintiely give the game a go!"

Your goal is to stay alive as long as possible to earn a high score. The course is divided into regions, which start off fairly relaxed as you fly through wide open spaces and around static objects, but gets progressively more intense as you squeeze through narrow gaps and make split second reactions to avoid moving objects. The race ends either when you crash, or run out of sunlight.Along the way you can collect various pickups. Blues increase your score, greens let you jump over obstacles, yellows give a speed boost and increase remaining sun time and purples allow you to respawn one time after a crash.During a race you can also work towards completing challenges such as collecting x number of pickups or earning a specific score. Every few challenges completed will grant you a level up and unlock a new pickup, or an item to equip on your craft. These items grant useful abilities, for example, the magnet will attract nearby pickups, and the jump storage lets you carry two jump pickups instead of one. But you have limited item slots, so your choice can influence your playing style.The map is procedurally generated every 24 hours, which means success depends more on skill than memorising the map. It also helps to keep the game fresh. Graphics are minimal, but that's actually a good thing. When you're flying at such high speeds, more detail would be distracting. Controls work well with either keyboard or 360 pad. I haven't noticed any bugs or crashes.Race The Sun is a simple concept with excellent execution, and it can be really fun when played in short sessions. I currently have logged 78 hours on Audiosurf and 29 hours on Aaaaa playing half an hour at a time, and I can see myself doing similar with Race The Sun.I definitely recommend checking this game out, and with such a low purchase price, there's no need to wait for a sale."

You can keep going on battery for a short time, but you are basically a solar powered glider racing towards the sun. The longer you go the deeper the sun will sink, shadows of obstacles will grow longer and harder to avoid, which will slow you down or even stop you, all while obstacles get more plentiful and trickier to navigate around as the game progresses.One of it's main features is that the scoreboard and the map are reset every 24/h, which keeps it fresh and it's a great way of making exploiting kind of pointless. The leveling system is kind of interesting, but very linear and one-dimensional.Overall it's a stylish little game. It's great fun and optimal to pull out for 5 minutes every now and then."

You contol a solar powered speeder, attempting to stay in the sun so you can keep blazing through a minimalistic world, gaining points over time as long as you stay alive. Unfortunately, the sun is still setting even as you are shooting above the ground, so you have to pick up yellow boost powerups that temporarily cause your speeder to goREALLYfast, so fast that the sun raises in the sky as you are going faster than it is setting. There are blue triangles scattered across the level that give you points, and getting five of them multiplies the passive point gains you get.The level you play in are separated into regions, each region giving you harder and harder obstacles. The level is procedurally generated every 24 hours, being consistent for all players for that day.Hitting a wall kills you, and the run is over. If the sun sets, or you simply sit in the shadows too long, you will lose power. This isn't an instant loss, but without power the craft starts slowing down, eventually coming to a stop if you can't get sunlight fast enough. When you do come to a stop, the run is over and you have to try again.There are little tasks that the game gives you to do. There are easy, medium, and hard tasks. Completing the tasks will give you experience that goes towards leveling up, leveling up unlocks more features. Easy tasks give one experience point, medium tasks give two, and hard tasks give three. Please note: the multiplier and boost are only available after you unlock them, but it's only level 2-3, which is simple to get. There are also a ton of more fun features you unlock as you level up, like power ups, and ship decals.You can't beat the game, you just go as long as you can, getting as many points as you can. There are leaderboards that reset each day as the level is regenerated, so you can compete with your friends, and the world.Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this game, and I hope you get it.Unless you don't like these kind of games, I completely understand."

A slower-speed option could help newer players through the awkward progression system, but the game is still solid.I've never really been a fan of the runner genre, but this game cleans up the issues and polished the best parts. Still, the amount of content is fair, but I don't think the game is incredibly replayable. Most reviewers are around 5 hours or less, with very few above 10.

This game could have been a straight forward survival game were all you had to do was dodge objects and see how long you could survive.  Instead the developers added an excellent mission system to challenge the player to explore and try new things.  The natural growth of your skills combined with a thoughtful quest system makes this a very rewarding experience.The title says it all in this game.  As you fly towards the sun you must avoid the different objects lie in your way.  The father you go the more difficult this becomes; columns with fall over to block your path, balls will rolls into your way, and at times you'll be bottle necked into a tight space.  Not only that but you must keep in the sun light to power your glider.  The sun will slow fall on its own but if you stay in the shade of the objects for too long your battery will start to die and sun will fall much faster than normal.  You'll be motivated to explore to collect Tris to gradually increase your multiplier which is necessary for getting a high-score.Thankfully, you have power-ups and attachments that will help on your journey.  A yellow boost will both increase your speed while simultaneously raising the sun.  The green power-up lets you jump over obstacles were as the purple power-up shields you from a fatal collision.  Over time you'll unlock and level up attachments, some of which let you hold onto multiple power-ups.  Other attachments let you survive longer in the shadows or increase your ability to turn your ship faster.The attachments along with other perks are unlock though the mission system.  At all times there are three tiers of progressively challenging missions.  The first tier is usually so easy its just a matter of time before completing the quest.  The other two tier offers more challenging tasks you'll have to go out of your way for.  These goals range from doing multiple double jumps, flying through multiple zones with no collisions, or building up a really big multiplier.  When you complete a quest you get experience points based on how difficult the challenge is.  Build up enough experience to level up and receive a reward for your hard work.You really feel a wonderful sense of progression playing this game.  Overtime you'll get used to certain obstacles and become more confident with the super tight controls.  Everyday offers a new procedurally generated level.  As soon as you begin to memorize and master one world the next day offers a different layout.  This is great mechanic that keeps the players on their toes while making for an excellent competitive game where you can compete with friends on a daily basis.  For everything this game offers it does a superb job.  Anyone looking for a fun game they can really sink their teeth into I highly recommend Race the Sun."

A Bit Slow Paced for A Fast Endless Runner.Genre: Minimalist Endless RacerDeveloped & Published by: Flippfly LLCPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux and iOS.Business Model: Cheaper Base Game + Single Optional DLCCopy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay ThoughtsAs it says on the store page, Race the Sun has you driving a solar craft across a vast, endless space filled with obstacles galore. Your only timer is a constantly setting sun that you must race towards. If the sun sets or you get caught in a long shadow for too long, the craft will run out of power and the race is over. Each world is separated by regions that get progressively harder as more objects and obstacles are thrown into your path. Within certain districts are portals to optional levels to change the pace up. Workshop support allows you to try out community created worlds though I found these got a little too difficult for my taste. There’s also a leveling system where you need to complete goals (given to you in a set of three) every time you race. Some are pretty generic with completing a certain amount of score or reaching a certain district while others can be overly difficult (do a barrel roll 20 times in a single try, yeah, still can’t accomplish that task). Additionally, your solar craft can be configured with different attachments and badges. These are unlocked as you level up and seem to be quality of life changes to your craft, not real game changers.It’s a simplistic game where all you do is steer around objects and hit as many power ups (speed boosters and jump boosters are the most common) as you can. The high speed action takes some skill and split second decision making in order to be successful. Even then, you can easily get plastered against a wall for not reacting fast enough and that can get old fast. If there was a main complaint I’d have, it's that unlocks take way too long to get. Even after a couple of hours, I still haven’t gotten a single badge and there’s still more than half of the attachments left to unlock. There’s a constant sense of frustration at not getting much reward for making even the slightest amount of progress. I often got tired of doing the first region over and over again because I crashed on a simple rock at the beginning of the second region. I feel like there could be a better way of handling it but I have yet to see an endless runner do anything about it. Race the Sun does have procedurally generated levels but the structure is largely the same and all that really changes is what objects are in each district. RtS used to have daily challenges but they seem to have been patched out.PC Settings and Sunrise DLCA fairly decent set of options can be found in Race the Sun. There’s a large amount of resolutions to choose from with fullscreen on/off. A quality slider that vaguely goes from fantastic to fastest. Vsync can be enabled/disabled. There’s two audio sliders for effects and music. Both a keyboard and a controller can be used and both work equally well. The keys can be rebound with optional secondaries. The Linux version seems to work quite well too. Anti-aliasing seems tied into the quality slider. I never had any performance problems or crashing. Video and audio work well together in this game too.The Sunrise DLC is for an optional world where there's no leaderboards, setting sun or optional objectives. It's ok but I kind of feel like its superfluous with multiple Workshop levels having the same rules. It at least looks quite pretty but I don't think $2 is worth pretty.Final ThoughtsRace the Sun has a good visual/audio design and it's one of the few endless runners I’ve run into that doesn’t try to waste your time with some nonsense business model. It's also a decently skillful runner too and has a good sense ofspeed, not dependent upon gimmicky controls or QTEs to slow you down. However, I find that the pacing is a little too long between unlocks. They can take far too long and too many runs to obtain and what you end up getting doesn't really change the game for the next hundred races. So, it can be a little too boring. If you’re ok with a repetitive endless run that isn’t looking to suck the money out of your wallet, Race the Sun is something to consider. Just don’t expect too much excitement and a lot of re-racing the first region.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade"

I love games like that), but quickly upgrades, achievements, accelerated movement, compounding level complexity, and ever approaching impending doom (the setting sun) escalate and elevate things beyond the competition.The game runs, as expected, incredibly smoothly on my i7 980x and GTX 680 at maximum settings and resolution. I suspect more modest systems would run it quite happily as well.The graphics are a bit retro, but very clean and adequately appealing. Most importantly, it effectively conveys a sense of speed.If you've never played any games in this genre (or happen to be a fan of them), Race The Sun is most akin to the Android game ""SpeedX 3D"", or the flash games ""3D Missile Game"" and its newer sibling ""Accelerator"".Links to the mentioned games:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamelion.speedx3dhttp://missile-game.bwhmather.com/http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/627313Bottom line: If you like ""infinite run"" games, RTS is a winner even at full price, and a steal with the current Steam discount."

If that wasnt' crazy enough I unlocked Armageddon mode and it quickly humbled me.The world resets every 24 hours so there are new challenges every day with the new map to explore.I've played with a controller and keyboard - both feel very good - I prefer controller myself though.I had a few issues getting it to start - but the support from the developement team was very quick and thorough - my issues are resolved and the game runs very smooth...now I just need time to practice so I can go for top scores."

The actual gameplay is a different factor, it can be VERY challenging in terms of actually making it far at least for me.The obstacles you'll be facing start off very easy but then turn extremely challenging and a lot of the times very cheap. Especially playing through it the first time, you will not be able to predict how to dodge the objects which means this game forces you into death until you learn the patterns. This was a little bit of a let down only because I was looking forward to reaction time playing a role here not just guess and check.To put it simple, you will die, you will die a lot. You will also try to avoid dieing but most of the time you'll have to do that in your second try.Does this put a damper on the game play? To an extend yes, but it doesn't hurt the over all game. The game looks great, plays great and frankly has some awesome moments that remind me of Journey. I'm sure there will be quite a few people that will enjoy playing this game on and off between classes, work or on lazy days.8.0/10 if you pick up during a sale and 7.5/10 if you purchase it at full price.

The developers, despite what I'm sure were good intentions, have made the game - if notimpossibleto play, then at least annoying to the extreme. Flippfly appears to have little regard for player imput, or indeed, play choice in how to play the game. They have implemented sounds that, if you find them annoying as I do, and want to turn them off - too bad. You'll have to turn off all game sound to mute the whiring, overheated computer fan sound of your engine.But I can deal with that. No, the reason for the negative review is the breaking of the game by compulsory community maps. I'm all for community participation in games, but when you areforcedto play maps off the workshop, the game becomes frustrating and broken. They are either overcomplicated, unintuitive, or simply completely broken - one places you in what I imagine the creator was a ""cinematic"" view, which has the kind of serious flaw of completely dislocating you from your ships position, resulting in crashes where you thought you shouldn't have been.Despite continual complaints against this forced participation and lack of player adjustablity, Flippfly has refused to even acknowledge there is a problem. If and when they fix these issues, I'll more than happily recommend this game to any-and-everyone. Until then, though, I can only recommend it if you're looking for a frustrating, unoptimizable, and, as a product of the two, broken game."

This is refreshing feature that can make me come back to the game to test my reflex skills.I like the minimalist art style and that the level is broken down into several regions with increasing difficulty. What I don’t like is the simplicity of the gameplay; there needs to be more pick-ups, ship abilities and controller buttons to press.With the Steam Workshop there might be some cool user levels to add variety.  But most people will get bored of this game quick, including me.  If you want to play this game you should wait for a bargain sale because you will probably only get a couple hours of fun.Race the Sun is a good game, but it’s one of those PC games best served on a tablet to pass the time.

In this game, you are, literally, racing the sun - when you stay in the dark for too long, you die. As the sun goes down, the shadows cast by the various objects become your worst enemy, making things increasingly difficult to survive. The developers implemented a leveling system, giving you access to several powerups and decals for your plane for completing various objectives - namely things like ""score X amount of points"" or ""don't turn left through 1 region"".

It is very beautiful for being such a simple looking game. What makes it really interesting is that the main level design gets changed every 24 hours so there is a new challenge everyday. The objective of the game is to go as far as possible before the sun sets or you crash. The game uses only the left and right arrow keys and the space bar, which makes it very simple to play, but it also supports controllers. Most of the user created levels are very good and do things you wont see in the main game. I highly recomend this game."

,Recommended,253030,11971721,"Posted: 3 September, 2014",all,Anti,"After way too many hours of this game, I think I can finally write a review that does the game justice.First off, you should watch both trailers so that you understand a little bit about how the game looks by watching someone play it.  They both sum up what things look like very well.  I'll write my review first from a mechanics aspect and end with an aesthetic aspectControls:The controls for race the sun are very simple and, I think, intuitive.  Arrow keys make you turn right and turn left; Space bar is jump.  They are remapable though I'm not sure I would ever want to.  Controllers are supported, but the game plays just fine with the arrow keys.  I'm pretty twitchy from playing shooters and RTS though.  You can tap the arrow key at varying speeds and get performance similar to a joystick or controller.  I've never found the controls to blame for any of my deaths after about the first 15 minutesLearning curve:Race the Sun introduces a leveled progression throughout this otherwise arcade style game.  Your first run is very simple: Dodge things, and try to hit the yellow speed boosts.  As you advance, power-ups like jumps, world portals, emergency portals (a get out of dying free card) and even portals that instantly warp you to the end of that level start to appear.  You level up in an interesting way: by completing challenges that the game poses for you, ranging from simple (like jumping 10 times) to complex, like only turning left for two regions (levels) in a run.  You have three at any time, and the simpler ones are often worth less, but makes it so that you can always progress.  By introducing these new features one at a time, you can get to grips with the new one instead of the game dropping a lot of confusing stuff on your head.Customization:Another consequence of the leveling system is that the game rewards you with mods for your flyer.  They do a variety of things from increasing the amount of jumps you can hold, to letting you grab power ups from farther away, to turning faster.  It's a nice way to tailor your craft to how you like to play. Additionally, you'll get the ability later on to choose multiple to equip.Procedural Content Generation:The levels in Race the Sun are procedurally generated.  Under normal circumstances, this would probably be infuriating, because every time you crashed you'd have to learn a new world (you'll crash often).  However, Race the Sun generates the same world for everyone, probably based on number sequence for each day to act as the seed for the generator.  There's no  downloads involved, and you can play instantly when you boot up the game or play offline anytime.  Since the levels are generated, you can also go as far right or left as you want.Graphics:Simple, yet good enough.  Shadows are dynamic based on the height of the sun, and actually imact the play of the game.  After all, your craft is solar powered.  Most things are simple hedron shapes, but it looks good enough that the graphics don't ever distract me.  Besides, since the sun is always in front of you, you usually only see the dark side of objects.  Occasionally you can blind yourself in the sunlight (it halos nicely when you're staring straight into it) obscuring things around you but is never bright enough to actually blind you.Gameplay:I think the game is fun as hell.  As you can figure from the youtube trailer, you move FAST.  You will miss things by next to nothing. You'll crash often trying to catch that one speed boost that you know you can't make and it will only be your fault.  I've never found myself blaming the game for a death.  The games are the perfect length to hop on and play one between doing other things.10/10: Perfect execution on what it set out to do.  Doesn't try to do too much.  Looks good, plays better."

The hardware you need to play is minamal and it never gets old because the levels reset every 24hrs. The more you play the more perks you unlock. So if you have played enough you will start off the game with a 3x multiplier instead of 1x and im sure there are other things that you can unlock later that I do not know of. The way you rank up is you complete challenges such as turn right through 1 region or collect 150 tris (blue triangles). If you have $10 this game is a must get.

It would be good if you could at least go backwards for a little bit, incase you made the wrong move. Overall, I recommend it."

If you know, you could likely make a lot of money out of that knowledge!-Regardless, this is a very simple game. You dodge the obstacles and gather the power-ups and ""coins"" (glowy triangle pyramids in this case). Sooner or later you either run out of solar energy, or, more likely, you hit an obstacle. You'll be annoyed, you'll likely swear some...and 30 seconds later, you will be playing again. Bit by bit you learn the track, and your score creeps upwards, and the next day, there is a new track. You do it all over again...and you love ever moment of it.Pro:*Simple, anyone can play this.*Exellent pick-up-and-play-for-5-minutes gameplay.*Superb ""goals"" that is attainable for anyone over time (only turn right for one zone, etc).*Gets your heart pumping as you zoom past obstacles, and frequently, into them.Con:*As usual with this genre, you are only travelling in one direction, and cannot turn around. I realise listing this as a ""con"" is subjective, ignore this point if you do not agree!*Likely to waste a LOT of your time, this game is addictive, you've been warned!Summary:An ""endless runner"" that is very simple, yet both stylish and fun.

The challenge system (by which you gain points towards leveling up, which in turn unlocks new upgrades and decals) is also simple, but incredibly addictive, and these challenges are creatively thought out, and will force you to approach the game in all kinds of new ways. It keeps the game from getting boring, and is always a great incentive to come back.I only wish the game had a bit more to offer beyond level 25. I have five hours on record here, and it was enough to let me reach the maximum level. There are two alternate game modes to unlock, both of which are quite unique and interesting, but it was the challenges that really kept me coming back, and it was frustrating seeing them disappear upon reaching the max level, even though there were clearly several left that I hadn't been able to finish.All in all, an absolutely worthwhile ten bucks, and a wonderful diversion that rewards patience, tenacity and skill."

The problem is I hate these types of games because all they are are a series of punishment. The only gratifying thing about the game is how far you can get and how much better you can perform than others. When the focus is on that, and not on the enjoyment of the actual gameplay (which suffers from mechanics that are just simplistic and unintersting, unfortunately), it kind of ceases to become a game. Games should be fun, and Race The Sun just isn't interesting for more than about 15 minutes at a time.It's nice that the level changes every 24 hours because it will keep things fresh for long-time players. But it's also Race The Sun's greatest flaw, because it puts this artificial ceiling on just how good you can get, and that's going to turn off new players.At the end of the day, Race The Sun is a niche frustration/self-punishment title. If that sort of thing really gets you off, then check out some YouTube videos, because this may be the game for you.

Often times onehit is all it takes to down you. That being said, as you progress in attempts you unlock new abilities; which include: boost, revive, jump, multiplier, etc... These abilities are custumizable and are unlocked in the way of challanges, which at first seem very difficult, but continued play will see them unlock. As for the achivements, some are glitched and others are just daunting, this is one of those games that each achivement earned is a trimuph. The game supports steam workshop which generally, provided reskined backgrounds, which are often a nice change from the usual background. Once you reach level 10 you unlock armeggedon mode which throws all the higher region difficulty at you up front, I recommend the game for those who like games in the vein of Temple Run or other other endless runners."

Although given the high-speed style, it might be more accurate to call it an endless runner / high-speed reaction game. The idea of mixing an endless runner with one that randomly changes is quite a good one. It gives you enough time to practice and perfect a race through, while using the random generation to prevent it becoming monotonous.The levels that are generated look very nice. It all has a minimalistic look to it, but there are specific styles of level that are created. You do begin to start to no longer notice the appearance and instead see everything as just obstacle / clear area.There isn't all that much to the game itself. It's quite simple. You can unlock new modifiers to play with, or use content from the workshop, but there will come a point when you've exhausted all that.I would tend to say that this is a good game.

Every time that I want to play something more relaxing to clear my mind, I find myself playing this game. Then I can continue something else what I was doing. You can play pretty much with every controller as well, because the controls are pretty simple.Though, as I said, it needs skill, if you have another person who likes this game, you can compete with your friend to get higher highscore (the map resets everyday, which is amazing). Also, there's Steam workshop, it's not that popular game, but there's few maps to try out and try to complete.Cons:As much as I love the leveling system at this game, it's boring that it's very easy to get to max level in just few hours. Then the game becomes more like ""I just want to play it for relaxing"", not ""I want to complete this game now"" -kind of game.-------------------There was The Steam Awards competition in 2016, where you could choose a game to each categoryI chose this game to "" The “Test of Time” Award "", because this is actually the game that I have big pauses between my game sessions, but the game that I have played since 2011 (yes, even before it came to Steam), and it is always as relaxing as it was the first time I played it.

For myself, I like to play it in the early morning when the sun is just coming up and the red hues shine through my window. I find this relaxing and calming, even if I crash my ship. It gets intense quite quickly, but if you relax and don't get tense, you'll probably do a lot better. Though, that is easier said than done. Either way, great game, definitely get it.I also played it on my channel and will be live streaming it soon ^^https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNtmxz0eQ4Y&index=1&list=PLy0EzovB5V3RPRrsrnRvvKtoLkWxPuEGC"

Also because the map changes every day you can play it without it getting dull and you have a new score to fight for.Just spend three and a half hours, instead of 30 minutes. But at least now I have a better highscore for today.One of the best games I have played in a long time!"

Its a game you jump in on, play for an hour and then keep it aside for a few days/weeksNevertheless the simple artstyle, steam workshop support and the challenging modes will keep you busy for a long time to come.overal a 8 out a 10"

Very simple mechanics that are easy to pick up combined with a map that changes daily translate to a fun experience that is always changing. The game has you flying a tiny solar powered craft against a setting sun, and while this sounds simple, the increasing amount of objects, combined with the ever shrinking amount of sunlight work together to increase the tension of the game exponentially as time speeds on.I also recommend getting the Sunrise DLC if you want to relax with this game or want to practice flying the ship without the tension of having to race against the dying light."

I leave with more smiles than I came.Never got through all regions or unlocked everything.It gets my recommendation for being a calming speedy racer.

,Not Recommended,253030,29869417,Posted: 12 February,all,Iamfishyfishy,"I got this game a few years ago and I haven't even touched it since. Rarely an update would show up, and even then it did very minimal.The gameplay itself is rather simplistic: You manouver a small air-craft through levels endlessly until you either crash or the sun sets, hence the name ""Race the Sun"". The game is easy at first, turn right, turn left, maybe jump. Pretty fun for the first say what, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, multiple hours, depending on who you are. But that's the entire game, you repeatedly play the same level with a little extra thrown in or taken out every day, yes it changes every day, and avoid obstacles while making it as far as possible. Shadows will slow you down. That's the full extent of the game, fairly shallow to say the least. There are these so-to-speak, World Portals, which will take you to a user-made level. Since there's no telling if they've made it literally impossible, that could potentially be fatal and cause you to start over again. There's no checkpoints, no saving, nothing. You start again.There's an ""Ultra-hard world"" called Apocaplypse, which supposedly makes you go faster than before and is significantly more difficult. Moving on from that, there's the paid DLC which you can purchase for a measly single level, which has almost zero challenge unless you're that uncoordinated. All you do is endlessly fly until you deliberately crash or exit the game. This is a good level to play if you're looking for a relaxing time and you can mute the in-game music so you can listen to your own while you do that, typically good if you have a controller and somewhere to lay back and chill out.In general, the game lacks simple things like more diverse levels or more music, just things that make it fun. As a player, I don't see why we should have to make our own levels to add anything interesting to the game, we should be able to choose from a few levels at the least. Yes, it's great you can make your own levels, but players shouldn't have to be doing majority of the work for developers. If you don't mind a rage-game in disguise and are willing to pay $10USD, knock yourself out. Otherwise, steer clear, this game just reeks of cash-grab."

It gets a bit stale once you complete all the challenges, but it truly is an enjoyable experience. The achievements are insanely difficult, but some people may be into the difficulty that this game's achievements provide.Pros:-Updated often, showing that the devs care-Maps change daily, so you never experience the same level twice-Steam workshop is a fantastic addition-Super easy to run at higher graphics settingsCons-It's really more of the same each time. I feel like you can't get better once you've learned how the basic controls work"
,Recommended,253030,34788735,Posted: 6 September,all,Z/-\|\|[)O1[),"WARNING!: EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE GAMEPLAY!That is what it should say on the store page for Race the Sun.From the small amount of this game that I have played so far (as of September 2017) I think this game is amazing. It is, as stated above, extremely addictive. A lot of the levels (especially as you progress to Apocalypse mode) are VERY difficult, and at times, controller-throwing-worthy frustrating. However, It is extremely replayable, and, with patience you will eventually start progressing faster. Oh, and did I mention that the levels CHANGE COMPLETELY every 24 hours, AND it has very nice soundtrack that suits the game PERFECTLY. It also has decent compatibility with LinuxThe one complaint that I have about the game is that I have a lot of difficulty setting up my Steam Controller to work with it. However, that may just be user error on my part (wouldn't surprise me). But that (and limited spare time) is the only reason I don't have more time on this game.I would highly recommend picking up this game at some point.9.99/10 ""Very Noice."""
