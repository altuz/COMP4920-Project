Not sure what I'm missing here, but it doesn't seem like a very intriguing game as it stands. Will check back regularly to see improvements, patches, and addons, but I don't find it keeping my interest in it's current state.(/Original Review)HOWEVERI WILL recommend either buying this game, or keeping your eye on this game, purely based on the fact these developers go way above and beyond to try and get everyone to enjoy it. Publicly, my old review was not agreed upon and I don't mind that. But that didn't even stop these devs from contacting me to let me know they're making changes and improvements, and even personally informing me of a new expansion coming. I'm definitely going to put this on my regular checklist of perpetually updated games.I may not enjoy the game like I do for others, but the developers are top notch - something you don't see more often enough with vidya these days. I hope you guys keep the professional attitude and personal touch in the future. It puts you way above a lot of other devs, and it's something we game enthusiasts really need.Thanks, guys! Can't wait to see what's to come."

But by Sunday evening we had all of these crashes fixed. I know it`s not a good excuse, but for a small team we couldn`t catch all the crashes ourselves before releasing this massive update.I hope to see you come back to give the game another chance, and sorry that your first experience with the game was during the two days that we had all these crashing problems.)ive seen so many games that i have backed only to be left to rot in page 2358 on the steam store and this one AINT one.so the dev team left a few bugs, but their small and that is to be expected! and the repair patch came out moments later so im left happy! :D"

Facing 4 AI in a free for all along with zombies is truly brutal. I would train thousands along with all the ai training thousands marching them to attack me and the other AI causing tens of thousands to die throughout the game. What did the zombies do? all those tens of thousands of troops got up and became a zombie. Talk about hardcore, not only fighting AI in extremely massive battles but also having to worry about all the massive armies that die become zombies?Let me tell you it didnt end well for me or the ai since thousands were dead infront of everyones castle. Having to worry about the enemy along with zombies is no simple task which makes it more challenging. When you fight there are 3 parties fighting which is you, the ai, and zombies ah and some random ogres and dragons every so often. This game is a very unique RTS game that has tons of replay value and content along with the weird crafting system which i personally am not into but it does add something most RTS games dont have.To answer if the game is worth it i would say yes and would very much suggest gettng it, sure you can find other good rts games but definitely not as unique as this. I mean, you not only fight AI you also fight zombies all at the same time. Pretty dang unique if you ask me and definitely not something you will find in another game."

I really like that the more you play the more units you can unlock through the mission rewards, and the trade centre is a great idea.  However, I do believe there are a significant number of bugs to fix as I have experienced a great deal.Pros:* Fun - Probably the most fun rts I have played in some time* Interesting buidling mechanics - I love that you can extend the outer walls and how you can go quite defensive to start* All races play very differently - I really like how different  the Orcs are, it really feels like you can make a horde* The maps are large and well balanced - They feel large at first, but it means you have to move and attack* Its hard - Im probably just rubbish at it (although I play alot of RTS), but I died on the first mission which is basically a tutorial. Thats never happened to me in a game before and I like the challenge (that was on normal mode)* Very active devs - You can see this within minutes of looking on steam and the ingame chat, its very good to seeCons:* Bugs - there are alot, but looking on steam they update frequently)* Visuals - I dont mean the gfx (which arent great), buit its quite hard to tell units apart. I think this is made slightly worse on the first campaign level as there are so many bodies, but it does get easier on the single player maps*  Units AI - The units seem to work great in smaller groups, but when you select the enmasse several dont move at all without helpTLDR; Buy it now, but it needs future support from the developers (who look super active)"

76561197978673857,Recommended,253190,23007381,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,Lesardah,I bought this game for the single player campaign and was not at all disappointed. It has a great story and each of the episodes are long and challenging (sometimes TOO challenging). They are also adding to the game constantly. I can't wait to see where the saga goes.
76561198162813338,Recommended,253190,21632175,"Posted: 4 March, 2016",all,DreadStyx,"This game has worked its way into accomplishment for beta to opening,Just like kingdom wars 1 its VERY smiliar but VERY different the part where it looks and feels is similar and the gameplay is different.Ive been beta testing this game since the day in came out. For beginners the first thing you should do is do the campign to get to know and feel how the game plays and works.I have encounterd this bug multiple times where in a Multiplayer mode you see diferent things then your teammate. But most of the bugs has been fixed from beta.When you first play hands on you should play all the races that you think best fit you or is your style.Humans-Good for beginners,1st Best race at defense. Hard in early game.Orcs-Third defense of the 3 races,Good for people who understand the game. They are best at early game.Elves-Once you play them it seems tricky but youll get use to it,With there stealth you can sneak capture towns.For feedback to the DEVS for a small team they deserve many cookies. I suggest making a new race (Dwarfs) like we all wanted in kingdom wars 1 the dwarfs would be master at defense then the humans at the best health but the slowest units and lesser damage. They would be the slowest race to build up their Econmy due to there advantages in defense. There main resource is stone. This is just a fan suggestion of mine but i could see adding the dwarf as a race could cause a promblem due to the the dwarfs being used by other races currently. But as i seen most people dont really use them.As I said keep on doing what your doing DEVS the game is great but can be even greater (New race c;). I highly suggest this to people who love Total war games,Kingdom wars 1,etc these types of games."
76561198042917560,Recommended,253190,17010245,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,Shadownamesto,"Kingdom Wars 2: Battles is an incredibly interesting concept in todays view of rts strategy games. It takes mechanics from all over, with resource nodes from games like age of empires or empire earth; huge scale combat from the total war games including the batallions of x amount of units per squad. It's so nostalgic and at the same time thrilling to play a game like this. As much as I'd like to praise it up to the stars and call it the new messiah, I can't do that fairly. So let's look at some of the negatives I've noticed during gameplay.- Archers: These guys are useful, but good god can they not aim at times. If you stick them on a wall, sure they'll aim as well as they can, but when you have about 3 orcish marauders (orc archers) left in a squad firing at your 5 squads on a wall, and killing them like flies while hundreds of arrows rain down upon the orcish invaders, and not a single one is hitting them, it's a little bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not even a case of them having godly luck by dodging, the archers just don't aim at them. They aim a bit to the left, or a bit to the right, and every single arrow aims in that spot instead of where the enemy is actually standing! It's infuriating! The siege is the same too, missing countless shots and wasting ammunition to try and flatten the ground next to the invader. AGH!- Terrain: This is a little bugbear of mine, but it still counts in this. On some maps you play singleplayer, I've found that if I try to play humans, and have stone walls defending the core of my city, I can't place anyone on the outer layer. By outer layer I mean the humans have a kind of bastion style design. If intruders break through the outer walls, they have to break through the inner gates. But the inner gates are broken into two parts. I won't fully explain it since I'd sound like an utter moron trying to explain something I don't know about, but look it up. I'm sure there are a few images flying around of the human castles by now.- Balance: As of the current release of the game, I've found that the elves are insanely overpowered. Now, in a lot of games I've played over the years, elves can be quite dangerous, but if you try enough, they'll fall over flat on their pretty little faces. In this game? Good god. They're the same as all others, don't get me wrong. Push enough and they'll still die. But in terms of resources, they will outlast you. How? They get a building called a symbiosis tree, which allows them to CREATE resources. Yup, I really mean that. They can create gold mines, stone mines, even more berries if they so fancy. This means they can keep pumping out entire armies of powerful troops, while you're scrounging around the map desperately trying to find some gold for another squad of knights.- Walls: Useful, correct? well, not when the wall is blocking all your arrows trying to murder a single zombie battering down your damn gate, and you can't open that gate because the zombie is hitting it. Infuriating, especially as an orc, since you only get one exit out of your plateau. Truly infuriating. It's made even worse when you watch your archers arrows hit thin air way above the barricades and the enemy on the other side is perfectly safe. Worst bugbear ever.Now, I know that a lot of these problems should be solved during the next couple updates, and admittedly they'll take a while. I'm an impatient person so I want them as soon as possible, so I can enjoy this game even more. But on the whole, for the feel this game gives you when you play this, it's totally worth it in my opinion. Especially for the price right now. £10.99? I'd pay £20 for this game, just because it's brilliant, and brings back the main thing I love in games like this; strategic options. Rush them, or defend. It's your choice."

I gave it a decent chance, I really did but this game does nothing for me.1) You cant save for yourselfin the campaign. It auto saves at check points. Thats it. I had to do the second level a couple times because of that. How can i not be able to save in a modern game.2) The engine on this game is terrible. I run BF1 no prob and then this game comes around and makes my machine chug. The ♥♥♥♥ is up with that.3) Voice acting in campaign is just straight terrible.I won't be finishing this game, which makes me angry. I would recommend not buying this game"

So this game is for you.It's only early access - there're some mistakes and flaws but it remains a great one.A lot of opportunities to get your enemy down or defense your own city. You can earn some * extra * out-of-battles resources to make your race stronger in the next battles. It also allows you to call a dragon ( but would be very expensive and hard to take ).Basically I wanted to buy the new game or additional to it * stronghold - crusaders 2 * but when I * suddenly * stumbled upon this I found it much better. IT HAS strategy possibilities. You can play alone, everyone against everyone (4v4) or 1v1 or 2v2 united.Shortly say: a good game with strong prospects"
76561198135544415,Recommended,253190,15216526,"Posted: 5 April, 2015",all,RabbitDarko,"This is a very fun little game. The single player is lacking, Needs a proper skirmish mode. Hopefully we get one. Other then that its similar to stronghold crusader, but with fantasy elements similiar to lord of the rings. Are the graphics amazing? no, not really, but its fun and its not taking itself too seriously. I play total war games when i want complete realism on the battlefield. The game is large scale, and i cant stress enough, just fun. You start with a town or whatever from which you build peasents. 1 squad of peasents is like 15 guys. So you build some squads and then you task them out to do things like..work mines for stone, kill pigs for food, loot corpses for gold and stuff, etc etc you get the idea. Each race is different, for example the elves do not chop down trees like humans  do. they are nature lovers or whatever so, they work with the earth.  You build houses to increase population cap. Each house adds 10 squads, each squad can have 15ish men in them. I dont know the max population...i havent hit one yet. But you can see from the video up top on the store page that the battles can be big. Theres upgrades and tech trees, things mostly make sense, like if you have catapults on your wall, they fire stones but in doing so they deplete them from your stock pile. Makes sense to me, Stones arent infinite and free to just toss around.  Theres alot of detail in the maps, The huge cities and towns are really pretty and well thought out. In closing....I dont know how popular this game is, there are clearly more of them, and this is the most recent, but i had never heard of these games before this one. so i cant compare the rest or anything, but man i feel like i stumbled across a little gem. This is true old school rts. Build a barracks get infantry. I compare this most with the lord of the rings rts battle for middle earth. Basically if Battle for middle earth and stronghold had a baby, this would be its offspring. Also reminds me ALOT of warcraft 3 so maybe battle for middle earth cheated with warcraft 3, and stronghold never found out, so stronghold helped raise the kid as his own. LOL"

The battles can be pretty epic with a fair amount of unique units for each class. Campain's decent and does a proper job at teaching you how to play, though still giving enough challange to keep you on your toes when fighting the ai.My biggest complaint is the massive lag I get when selecting and moving large armies, maybe it's the graphics card I use (I have a AMD Radeon) it's almost game beaking with the screen freezing up and trying to maneuver your troops. I've heard the devs say they're working on this and hopfully it'll get fixed soon, but if you're someone who likes his fps at its highest then i would recomend waiting until this is patched, otherwise it's genuinly fun.Also big points for the undead that can be used to your advantage, never played an rts where you can kill your amries off next to the enemy base just to have them raised as undead to finish them off."

Aggressive, Defensive, Random, Normal (semi-aggressive, semi-defensive)]Conclusion: A great game for early access, I love RTS' like this. Crashing and glitches that need to be worked on a bit, some optimization. PLEASE MAKE COMPUTER AI HAVE TO USE/GATHER RESOURCES, I understand that the AI may need to be better before this is done but just please do not leave it like this for the future. Overall a great game so far, don't expect a shining piece of art but if you like RTS and/or Fantasy games I HIGHLY recommend this early access title.Edit 1: One more recommendation, as far as the enemy defending worked, they just seemed to hangout where ever they were recruited, it would be nice if the enemy built stone walls, towers, etc and stationed troops on walls."

,Recommended,253190,19257676,"Posted: 24 November, 2015",all,mOOSE,"I am a big RTS fan, and this game is pretty revolutionary when it comes to the zombie mechanic. (You can turn off the zombies if you don't like them.) The game is basically any other Medieval RTS title, but has zombies! You fortify your castle and upgrade units and structures, there's a whole crafting system in this game, which is weird, but kinda cool. For most new players, like myself it took a few games to realize that I had to craft upgrades from the main menu to actually use them in game. But once I figured it out, the game really came to life.Basically how it works: You play campaign/multiplayer/singleplayer vs AI. Once you have played a few games, you will get these special resources, now I don't know how to actually acquire them, but it seems like the more games you play, the more you get. Anyway so once you have these resources you can craft certain upgrades that can be used in game. (For the Humans, Halberdier for example.) And after you craft the upgrade you can use it in game. Pretty cool stuff.All in all this game is pretty awesome. I mean it needs some more refining, and at random times may crash. (Save Often!!!!) It'll get framy and just gucky, so be prepared to have it crash, also sometimes your units won't respond to orders, I've noticed if you stop moving the screen and click it usually works. lol other than that this game is a diamond in the rough, totally worth the money if you wanna support the devs. It's really fun in the state that it's in. Can't wait to see what they do with it in the future!10/10 Would get sieged by Zombies again."

Read the reviews, everyone seemed pleased with their purchase, and it's not a bad a game per say. But... if you are interested in multiplayer games, there is a wretched desyncing issue. But it doesn't inform you of an issue. So while I was in discord with a few friends, playing a match against one another. One person was laughing that they were burning peoples cities down, while... On the defenders screen, literally no battle was occuring. Eventually we were not even playing the same game. Pretty disappointed."
,Not Recommended,253190,29183594,Posted: 11 January,all,Freshairkaboom,"Okay, lets be honest: My previous review was written in the golden age of this game. Since then, things have changed. The game's biggest problem is its low playerbase. It's still fully possible to play in singleplayer, but it's not fun in the long run.The activity level of the devs has gone way down, and if it wasn't for the global chat, you'd never find anyone to play with ever.It still has a lot of problems and bugs popping up, and at this rate I don't know if they will ever be fixed. I must give this game a thumbs down simply because there are safer bets out there.Take my word for it when I say though, I absolutely adore this game. Look at my total amount of hours in it and you'll see. When two good players clash in a 1v1 match, it's absolutely amazing. The games can last hours, or they can last 10 minutes.This game still lacks in diversity though. The best strategy in the game is still rushing your opponent and keeping up the pressure so the zombies will take care of them while your economy is untouched. However, most players know each other so well at this point, that we often make custom rules to make it more interesting.The most fun thing ever is letting your opponent build up a defense for like 40 minutes, and then trying to rush it down. That is in my opinion what the game was built for.I wanna say, only buy it if you have friends that want to invest a lot of time into it too."

The game has you start off gathering resources and training an army. After that the game turns into wolf killing simulator 2015 for a little while. Once you have your army ready for battle and your peasants working... then you are ready for battle! Battle consists of:-Killing enemies-Killing houses-Killing enemy soldiers-Killing your own men who turn into zombies-Watching your own men get killed by wolves that they passed bySo in all the game is definitely in alpha, but for $15 it has a great deal of potential."

If your peasents are harvesting a tree near a cliff edge, they will often times forsake the tree next to it and climb all the way down the mountain to harvest the tree down the cliff that is closer horizontally.2. Dragon animation is choppy and poor. When it flies over a wall it sort of warp lands on the other side. It also shoots fireballs out the back of its head when you target a location behind where it is looking.3. The graphics are fairly poor compared to other rts games of this time and genre.4. The peasant animations are also choppy and the cycling for the chopping animation on trees does not transiition smoothly resulting in them rapidly raising the axe two times in a row.5. I got the dragon slayer achievement just by letting the enemy ai take out the dragon and I looted the dragon treasure afterwards.6. The boulders from the trebs tend to explode in mid air above their targets at times.7. The level of castle customization only accounts for placing buildings, you can't choose where to build your walls and you can't place indipendant towers so establishing a defensive position is only possible with units and possibly occupying ai creep camps.8. Sometimes only a few units in a group attack the enemy, letting potential increase battle effectiveness slip by since the rest of the group just sits back for 5 seconds waiting to join the battle.9. The map variety is zip for single player. They are the same sections of land repasted in different patterns. Not much variety from the original F2P version of Kingdom Wars. (not a bug)10. The enemy ai likes to sit outside your gate while you slaughter them with arrows because they forgot to bring siege equipment with them.11. Also not really a bug, but I don't find it really feasible for zombies that are already loose conglamerations of flesh and guts to be able to tear down solid stone walls.12. Peasant ai sux.13. Peasants don't finish off a tree before they go ADD and decide to go look for another tree to chop down. (unless the decay animation is really slow and hangs around for a while after the tree has been exhausted, but I wouldn't know since there is no indicator as to how much wood is left in a tree)14. Not a bug, but you cant have multiple save games of single player battles/skirmishes. Makes me frustrated that I cant save at any point in the campaign missions.15. If you save during the zombie horde survival single player mode, and let yourself die then you can quit the game after you get the reward and continue again and repeat and get a lot of crafting mats. At least that happened to me after I got to wave 7. (I only exploited this glitch three of four times).14. ECT.Overall, I love the concept and idea, just poorly implemented. To be honest, I would reccomend The Lord of The Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2 over this any time. Therefore, I do not reccomend this game until they fix and polish the mechanics of this game.Sorry for the grammer mistakes, but I don't feel likefixingthem."

Suddenly you have this nostalgia of old games with modern mechanics and it really is fantastic.One of my favourite features - zombie survival in an RTS! You have a castle like a normal game but you're tasked with surviving wave after wave and this can be done cooperatively! After every 3rd wave you unlike crafting materials that you can use after the battle to craft the various cards and race upgrades.This is just a taste of what the game offers and I have barely scratched the surface my self, but with such helpful and ACTIVE dev team members in game chat (which is visible throughout all games and menus) I felt compelled to write my first review of a game in a long time.Buy it, support the produces and watch this fantastic game grow - there's a lot to offer and the team have an amazing philosophy, something we cannot say for most modern games these days."

When you tell units to move often the flag doesn't appear at their chosen location, and if you select a group to move it's pure guesswork where they'll end up.Upgrading troops is a pain because there is no noticable indicator they're ready for upgrade unless you click on them individually, additionally once you've upgraded one unit type (i.e. archers) the UI bugs out for all subsequent upgrades.The graphics are poor, and there are several anomolies including blue and white screen flashes.Presumably as it used to be a FTP MMO there is no save option in the single player campaign, you have to wait for checkpoints which can be hours apart. I tested the checkpoint save system by waiting till a checkpoint and exiting, and on reloading it had lost 40 minutes progress, it was at this point I decided it was time for a refund."

(in the end I lost, I ddint have enough recourses becuase they were all gone and my market would not give me any gold for all the meat I was trying to give it, so in the end I lost becuase I could not defend my walls)Overall this game in its current state is a 7/10maybe in the future it can go beyond that but for not it doesnt seem like it, and also if they do not fix the bugs and quirks happening throught this, my rating for this game would drop to a 4/10.

,Recommended,253190,28251583,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,Lollipopsunder,"(I bought this game on sale, so keep that in mind when reading)The graphical style of this game is its lowest feature, but if you can get past it or it doesnt matter to you then youll find a fun, albeit imperfect game. Kingdom wars 2 is an RTS in the classic style with some intresting intricacies and improvements on the overall formula. There are a few main recources: food, gold, wood, stone, and population. Where the game shines in my opinion is the differeing abilities to gather these recources. For instance, after a battle you can task peasants to loot corpses for gold and valuable loot, and as they do so they will also make sure the soldiers that died dont come back from the dead. Which brings me to arguably the most fun part of this game, the zombies. The zombies are a dynamic RTS threat that I have not seen done anywhere else and they are enough to pick this game up if you see it on sale.When fighting the zombies you have to take a completely different approach to combat. If you send waves after waves of enemies to get chopped up by them youll only make the situation worse, because those freshly dead corpses will rise up from the grave to haunt you. If they get out of hand they can easily overwhelm you and with a combined effort topple your walls and destroy your recources crippling you completely as they overwhelm your stronghold. Being defeated by the zombies is almost fighting them.Keep in mind this review is only for the single player, as I have not tried the multiplayer, but even as a solitary experience I found this game worth a buy at sale cost."

Then most of the bloody bodies on the ground come back as zombies .The devs do throw a wrench into the game just as you think you are winning a mission to make it interesting.There was a mission where the enemy just kept coming and coming ...i was down to my last wall and they broke in , i charged at the orcs with whatever i had left but it was looking bleak. Just as i was bout to cry and fap over losing a 2 hour battle , a cutscene happened ...this was the way the mission was built ...has a lotr twin towers type ending then get saved at the last minuteBugs:there are tonnes of bugs , some can prevent you from completing the mission and you might have to start it all over again .I had a mission where i couldnt cross a bridge  and i was 4 hours into it. I actually did restart it next day , and same bug was gone .Your own troops seem unresponsive sometimes.Ive heard some people cant finish multiplayer coz the end screen doesnt come up.If you load a save , there might be  cracks in the walls you cant repair and enemy will just pour through themI addressed the bridge bug with a mod on the game -chat (there always seems to be a mod on to help people out) , and tried to help me out .Im sure they will iron these bugs outGraphics arent the best in the world , but i dont care too much .The singleplayer is only 5 missions (""New Episodes will be released as a free expansion pack, every few months."" ) , but i spent hours n hours doing these.I also tried out a co-op mission and a survival mission (where u fight incoming waves of zombies).Every online mission you do gives you crafting rewards that you spend on cards (i.e. extra 2000 gold in game ) or the tech tree (giving you advanced troops for online play) and theres a sort of auction/trade button on the main menu"

The gameplay of the elves is so different from that of the orcs you would think you're playing a different game!- very interesting siege defense and battles. There are very few AOE style RTS games out there that♥♥♥♥♥♥such an emphasis on siege elements, and this game does it quite well. Both defending your forts and laying siege on the enemy ones feel exhilarating.ConsNote that this game is still in early access stage. I assume and hope that some of the issues below will be fixed/improved. But it is always possible that they won't be. So I think people wanting to try the game should know about them.- this likely will stay, but it's not too much of an issue for me. The graphics is quite outdated for a 2015 game, even with everything on the highest quality. But for an indie game it's really not bad at all.- the most serious problem is the constant crashing. 9/10 skirmishes i played ended up CTD. The official solutions did not work. And that's when i have a good rig i7 + gtx 980 ti- some of the useful features that are omnipresent in RTS games are missing. E.g the game wont automatically redirect to  a unit after you press the number they are tied to, nor are they shown in a specific color on the minimap to tell you where they are.- your units can be pretty unresponsive to your commands.All in all it is a very fun game.

76561198031785617,Recommended,253190,19853719,"Posted: 22 December, 2015",all,Paco,"This is a conditional recommendation.The multiplayer is busted on all adversarial modes, the campaign is unfinished and the singleplayer lacks a great deal of enjoyment due to buggy controls and resultant lacklustre gameplay. I recommend either getting this game now and waiting for fixes, or buying it later, so the devs still have an incentive to finish their product.With all that in mind, here are the reasons you should buy this game:Units: The units in this game are large scale and yet have plenty of time for tactical diversity. Varying formations and abilities hark back to the good days of Total War, whilst the Stronghold-like maps are utilised well to create interesting battle scenarios. However, the aforementioned lag makes utilising a large-scale army near impossible and the clicks needed to fight most effectively simply cannot be dished out. Furthermore, the movement is basic at best, with units sometimes not moving to where you want to go at the right times. This can be especially annoying when it means losing half your army to someone pouring pitch over them or them walking into spike traps. What remains though is potential - with optimisation and bug fixes the unit system will be enjoyable. Conditional recommendation. Get it once this is better.Buildings/Economy: The economy system works well. Things are well priced and utilised well, with clear diversity between the races (more on this later). There is a mechanic called ""trickle"" where you get small-scale income from various buildings/units, whilst gatherers bring in large-scale resources. This provides a multi-tiered system whereby you can manage the short and long term economic needs of your settlement. Furthermore, the design of the buildings is clearly different for all three and provides more clear strategic diversity, with the settlement sieges being truly compelling and enjoyable at the later stages of the game. What's wrong then? Well, the game pre-sets where your walls are going to go, so you don't construct your own elaborate fortifications and they will be the same each time, with the same set-up, regardless of map. This means that in terms of defense, it can get quite samey. Furthermore, for all races but the elves, the ability to snipe resource points from outside the walls can make defending in the long-term impossible.  More needs to be done to ensure fortresses fall and aren't merely starved out in a 2 hour long staring extravangaza. Again though, there is plenty of potential for this to develop as the game goes on.Other: The races provide good strategic diversity in terms of their late game potential and ability but the cards and tech development is a bit of a sham. For a lot of the cards and techs, they do exactly the same thing but are just reskinned. I can't see this improving.TL/DR: Poor multiplayer. Broken campaign. Fun as hell mechanics though and plenty of potential. Put this on your wishlist and keep a lookout for improvements."

And I'm confident that it will get much better due to the fact that the developers are extremely interactive with the community, asking players what they would like to see included in the game and how they would like it to develop.Most of the critical, ""not recommended"" reviews fail to understand or take into account that this game is still in development.Yes there are bugs and problems encounted but the devs are actively interacting with players and constantly fixing and updating the game.Yet, even in the present development stage, this game is fun to play with some very unique gameplay.I'm happy to stay on the ""development ride"" and looking forward to see this game achieve the success it deserves."

My only complaint is that the story mode is not complete yet but what is done was a real blast for anyone that likes fantasy RTS.Graphics are nice and upgraded from the original Kingdom Quest but could still use some work. From the max zoom out units can easily be lost in the back ground and behind objects while zoomed in figures appear a bit blocky and environmental objects are not scaled accurately to character size. However please remember I said this still looks better than Kingdom Wars 1 if you have seen it. If you have not please go try it, it’s another great game by the same people and amazingly fun for lovers of both RTS and RPG.Game ran smoothly for the most part with occasional jerkiness when I simple had the screen filled with more than 100 individual troops but I did have one unknown random crash while the game was loading. This only happened once and I have not been able to duplicate.All in all I can’t wait for the final product.Game played on a 3.3 Intel Xeon Processor, 8GB Ram, Nvidia GTX 960 4GB, Samsung 512GB SSD."

It is something that isnt done in the RTS genre, and it really opens up different avenues of strategy in taking down the enemy base. Another consequence of this game mechanic is that it forces you to make sure that you have enough troops when exploring or else you will be overrun by your -former- soldiers as they die off.There are many other reasons why this game is great but they are commonplace in the RTS genre.Now, for the reasons why this game sometimes annoys me.- You need to unlock the tech tree for each race individually using items and other things found during your campaigns. This makes it feel grindey just trying to get the tech.- There are a multitude of bugs such as units getting stuck and units not following orders- Siege rams are way too op right now. I shouldnt be able to take down three gates with a single ram against a fully defended castleHowever, despite these cons (most of which can be fixed by either game balancing or bug fixing) this game is a definite buy."

(hurts my eyes at first, squinting and whatnot. im using a 55"" TV and my glasses are scratched) but you get used to it and notice the GFX are decent.-edit-20 hours in... I think I left my game on... anyways. I get this feeling of Warcraft when playing. LIke warcraft 2 and 3 but a mix of age of empires and some TW... pretty cool.. This game currently has little lag for MP, from canada to au theres  ~ 0.1 second lag. not really a big deal. The huge battles make up for it. Orc for example has a pop of 80, and each 1 is 10 units I think..lol and you control 10 as a group.  Theres lots of upgrades and stuff like stances and formations that look really cool when you have 100+ units. They all level up and have personal upgrades too.This is made by a small dev team so if everyone could support them I think they will continue to improve this game and will make huge improvments each future game.plus free dlc/expansions. who does that?If you want TW but dont have the money or w/e and you can deal with less then AAA quality games then you should ppprobably get this.2nd edit-40 hours in. .. wow already?nice.. still enjoying it.need more players for sure.its a bit buggy.. random stuff..

If you chase me ill run, if you get my archers ill change up my strat super quick, with one building I can change all my archers to polearm and bye bye calvary. If i need calvary my building is already built. since orcs eat their mounts., MMM lol.Not sure if it needs balancing or everyone is just new and cant handle the rush/spam.I wouldnt wanna be on the recieving end thats for sure.But really... archers autospawn for free.. literally cheap.

A simple wooden palisade and a few buildings near rich deposits of stone and gold form the seed of what will grow to become a mighty city.

As time passes scouts are sent to map the local area...most do not return. The wild is littered with ravenous packs of wolves and fortresses dot the landscape striking at any who venture too close. It has been decided, as the old mines run out and the stirring sense of adventure grows in the hearts of the settlers, it is time to claim their destiny. Armed and armored brave companies of soldiers ride out to meet those fell beasts. The hordes of teeth and claws fall before a volley of arrows and crash upon stalwart shields. The forts are besieged and the defenders rush out to defeat the brave warriors, but they to fall to the mace. As the soldiers break open the gate they swarm over fortress slaying the brigands and cutthroats. At the end of the day, when the banner of the new kingdom flew from the tower the settlers knew they had the grace of the gods.Word spread to the now mighty kingdom of an ancient elvish city in the far north, recluses who killed any who approached their gates. The people of the kingdom knew that this new foe would be a hindrance to any further growth, they too must be eradicated, such was the divine will.

But as a player who has joined many of these said same games, I cannot stress how different this one is. The developers are EXTREMELY ACTIVE! Don't believe me? Look on the forums and click a random topic and you will see how.Now I remember when this game was first launced and how buggy it was, haha those who are vets know what I am talking about and all the glitches we all used to take advantage of. But the thing is, all the people in the player base post on the forums explaining in detail about these same bugs. Depending on how bad it affects gameplay depends on how much priority the developers give to fix it. When I say priority I mean those with a huge effect, developers try to fix it with the next patch, Those with low priority get fixed within a few weeks. Now those of us who were here since beginning had fun PVP and with campaign, but the game changers that EVERYONE mostly LOVES was the zombie feature. Haha I cannot tell you all how much fun I personally had in matches online with the zombies.The times in a FFA where 4 players are going head to head trying their all to take one another out, but alas due to all the deaths and carnage in the midst of the ruined battlefields undead would arise. Now in the beginning this was a major issue, personally I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVED IT!!!!!!!! Nothing more thrilling than that first player finally getting his base destroyed by your forces and wondering how the other 2 players are doing in their battle. Just as you are finishing up mopping uphis building in his base and of course handling the undead that appeared during your battle. As you are taking it all in you see either your base or the rear of your units taking damage. seeing it is a few steady stream of undead coming from the other 2 players side of the map. You cannot help but notice that the stream is getting larger and larger slowly forming into a horde, thus you must reorganize your troops before they die and add to the already large undead horde. Only once that you FINALLY (Ya those of you that had been in that situation know what I mean when you finally get them under control like an infestation) get the undead under control you decide to send a scout to see how the others are doing because these undead came from their end. Only to discover a massive horde beseiging both of their bases and them fighting for their lives against the AI. Ahhhhh haha I will never forget those beautiful games where all players put aside their differences of humans, orks, or elves and team up to exterminate the undead on the map before they completely take us all out.Those were proud memories I have of this game, memories that years from now as I get older I can talki video games to others my age or younger and tell them of a game that I really and honestly had alot of fun playing. Kind of like I do with Age of empires from when I was kid.Zombies now are a joke from what they used to be, they do not give that rush of a feeling but i guess in some instances it is possible to get that horde feeling even if it is just for a few minutes.-Wanderer"

All in all the zombies are a really fun addition to the battlefield, and seeing them wander around and do there thing is pretty cool, and alot of people bash them, but they add a whole different strategy to the game! you can lead a horde to the enemies gates and watch it attack the front gates and mob in through the mangles doors! Or my personal favorite: building a huge army and just charging over the walls and getting wiped out, but doing enough damage to let the corpses rot, and then wake up and start burning there town down from the inside! Honestly my only qualm so far is the peasents! They are SO stupid lol, and when you're playing against AI players that sit in there fortress its one thing, But I can imagine it would be very frustrating being in the middle of multiplyer game and all of the sudden have to divert all of your attention to stopping your peasents from being slaughtered in droves by a dragon, or the zombie hordes, or a HUGE pack of wolves for some reason, because they got bored doing what you wanted them to do.

It runs without problem in 4K with everything but shadows maxxed out, in spite of many units and animations taking place at any one time. It is very competitively priced as well.For me, a key strength of the game is the interesting storyline, which takes several unexpected turns along the way. The injection of zombies is an unforeseen ""X factor"" in the game and is a delightful twist. Graphics and animations are well done, detailed and suitable for for the races and monsters. The makers have chosen a slightly more painterly color palette over the usual choice of ""herioc primary colors"", which is much more appropriate for dysmal muddy, filthy and downtrodden depressed mood of these imagined medieval times.To me, the game feels mostly like a great book that is very hard to put down again and I am recommending it to everyone who is a fan of the genre."

As far as i'm concerned it's taken the crown off stronghold as best siege RTS.I was initialy dissapointed that you can't build walls wherever you want, but after some time playing I quite like that mechanic. It means you spend less time trying to line up walls and more time planning your defences and assaults. They've actually done a good job with the archers, where as in many RTS games they seel underpowered, in this game they can make a brilliant defence, and are something you have to seriously consider when looking to assault an enemy stronghold.I also like the unlock system. It adds a sense of progression to the game outside the campaign, and gives you something fun to try out after every few games. And the zombies are also a brilliant addition. I know zombies have been done to death, but never on this scale in a siege RTS. It's a cool little modifier in regular matches, giving you a reason to clear up corpses and making large battle sites a threat, and the zombie survival mode is great fun, and a different sort of challenge. Nothing beats loading up your walls full of archers with fire arrows :D"

Theoretically.It has so much potential. So many good ideas. The resource/card system is cool and adds a ton of different strategies, and other than a few balance issues its fun to play all the races.This game is so good, it has the potential to be my favorite game of all time. But it falls short with tons of issues.I had terrible sync drops in which I would be playing with a friend in the same room and our units would not be in the same place on the map, or his base would be totally destroyed but on my screen it looked perfectly tranquil.Game breaking glitches in which buildings that auto produce units, still continue to produce units after the buildings are destroyed making it impossible to get a strategic upperhand. It was so frustrating playing against my friend that plays orcs, and I harass and outplay him, but once his buildings are destroyed, they continue to make units and I could never make any ground.The zombie survival mode was fun, but after a few waves, my partner would always disconnect and drop from the game and so I end up just playing the rest out on my own anyway.The Campaign was the best part of the game, and thats not a good thing to say about this kind of game. The campaign should just be a tag-along to a fantastic online gaming experience.Overall, I would say this game is worth your time if you enjoy playing Real Time Strategy games. Or if you like building castles and armies and making your friends look dumb when you storm their weak and feeble peasants with knights or warg riders. I've had a great time with this game. I would have put more time into it if there was ever anyone but the one player that constantly beats me online."

I wish I had more freedom with the maps, unit color freedom, and it seems that regardless of what map you pick, you're still pretty much in the same spot (single-player mode) ....you can branch out to other parts but don't have the ability to restructure as you would in AOE.When clicking on ""idle workers icon"" it will highlight them, but doesn't seem to take you to them, so unless you are on top of area, you won't see the highlights....causing me to have to hover over wherever i see my color, in order to hopefully see highlighed workers.

Content was limited, maps were few in number, and the primary game mode was a half-finished survival style of game.I'm happy to say the game has been significantly improved since then. Yes, it's still a bit ugly (perhaps more specifically dated looking), has a clunky UI, and seems to ignore mouseclicks every so often. What it does do is provide an enjoyable gaming experience, within the very specific realm of a survival style siege defense game. The competitive multiplayer I haven't played much, but judging by comments, continues to go in the sort of balance circles we've become familiar with in recent years. (Rock OP, Paper is fine. -Scissors.)I don't consider the patches and fixes they've released for free to be a glorious gift, full of exciting new content, but they are still patches and fixes, a sign that the developers are committed to continuously improving and expanding the game.Kingdom Wars: Battles has always been a game for a specific nice sort of player, looking for a particular experience.

,Recommended,253190,22456421,"Posted: 16 April, 2016",all,Fancy Face,"Kingdom Wars 2 provides a brutal but satisfying RTS with a campaign that will carefully beat into your head the importance of slow, careful preparation. Fittingly for a game set in a medieval world, the elaborate fortifications that sprawl across key points of the map are crucial when it comes to holding and expanding your territory, and building up proper defenses first and foremost, both in campaign and multiplayer. Watching a ramshackle palisade grow, bit by bit, into a proper stone castle manned by hundreds of archers and swordsmen never gets old, along with seeing the enemy break on it.Additionally, the three races within the game all manage to be unique in both mechanics, playstyle, and design. The Humans are the most ""standard"" faction, training troops from buildings and taking resources from the map. Their workers are fragile, their units work wonderfully together, and their defenses are incredibly strong.The Orcs automatically spawn workers from their buildings, which are then sent through ""training"" to become stronger units. Their defenses are lacking, but their troops are strong, with their workers able to fight at range and in melee both, serving as their basic infantry.Elves are an interesting case, having one of the strongest economies, but otherwise unremarkable defenses and soldiers. The ability of the elves to spend money to make more money, without having to send their workers outside their defenses, is quite powerful, and allows them to build up massively if given the chance. Their greatest strength is their ""monstrous"" units-massive ents, for example.The Undead, fittingly, completely change the game once they show up. In Skirmish and Campaign both, they seemingly come across as a minor creep faction that can be dealt with easily, until they swarm you in the aftermath of a major battle and you realize every single corpse can and will become another enemy. Relying on the day and night cycle to combat their spread is crucial, before they turn into an existential threat.Lastly, while the graphics are seemingly lackluster, they serve well enough and allow the game to throw together truly massive battles with troops in the tens of thousands, with the only limitation being how big you are willing to make your army."

As a player of RTS style games for many years now, I can safely say this is one of the greatest indie RTS games I have played. In fact it is a solid RTS, for the price, and I haven't really seen anything that was comparable.It features:Progressive Gameplay; I.e. upgrade talent tree that is outside of the actual battles. You gain loot and such, then spend it to gain benefits, such as a knight, or spearman, buildings, etc.Common RTS elements and uncommon RTS elements, all that are good. Base building, troops, management of resources. Uncommon includes choosing to grow chickens vs pigs, to send a cart or not, where to build a farm, how to use the resources. Do I use the wood for this or that, what do I use the stone for, the gold for, do I use food for peasants or soldiers?Each match (this was awhile ago, sorry if review is outdated), plays out with a strong tactical gameplay set AND elements normally limited to turn based games. The maps are fair sized, and there are plenty of objects to go for. Want more gold, get a cart, some peasants, and send them out to mine. You may need to station soldiers nearby to protect them from enemies, including the undead.Speaking of the fallen, things that die have a tendency to, well, come back to kill you. If things are left unlooted, which must be done by peasants, they will come back and be an annoyance. At first this seems trivial, but can be abused to cause injury to your foes. Raid the neutral camp near your enemy's base early into the game with a medium sized force. This way if your troops succeed, a large dead force will strike at their peasants and fort, and if not hopefully many die, and the same result may happen to your foe.Neutral camps, the enemies vary, usually protect resources that you need in order to survive and expand, and are worth looking into.The game is somewhat complex, and has bugs, but is definitely worth the investment."

,Recommended,253190,25079880,"Posted: 22 August, 2016",all,Mr.,"So I am going to go on a whim and write this review purely on opinion and not on gameplay. Firstly, there are two main grouped sub-categories of people who will like this:1) Medieval/RTS fans will find this game unique, and kind of follows a old-school style of play where you primarily build up your base in one main location. If you like the Medieval/Fantasy theme that is also a bonus2) Players who can get over polish and odd textures. Yes, this game feels a little ""clunky"" but since this a review I have to be real, the game is still a little clunckly. But the interface and fantasy animation effects are only a means to an end, and that the game does require more polish. The animation for some units especially when they are attacking or mining a resources looks terrible, it just doesn't look right nor professional. However, since I've played a large variety of games, I've learned to ignore those visual effects and focus on the gameplay itself.Gameplay: So the reason I am giving this a thumbs up review is because I feel like this game does bring something unique to the table, it's a real-time base-building/ siege simulating strategy game that involves zombies. Now, that is quite creative as I don't play many medieval/fantasy games that involve zombies (well I guess if you play a lot of fantasy there is usually a necromancer, but nevermind that). Anyhow, the siege aspect of the game is very unique and I do feel like I am playing in the realm of some medieval world in how much preparation is needed to breach a wall.So here is where the cons come in, and this is very important because this list of 'bad aspects' of this game is what throws most people off when they first buy it (I bought it at the original price of 29.99$ on Steam despite numerous other sites that sell the key cheaply because I wanted to support the continued development of this game).1) At some point in time when playing this game, your going to get lag spikes, on some rigs it may never go away. The game engine seems to lack the integrity either to handle newer machines or it is just in general bad coding. I'm not an expert so I'll just leave it at that2)Again visuals and animations do not look fantastic, there is an endless amount of games I could list that have amazing visual effects for units in RTS games when it comes to mining, dying, spells, fighting, etc. etc. Kingdom Wars 2: Battles will need to desperately mend this problem if they wish to appeal to hard-core RTS fans since this is a major draw to the game is the pretty graphics, especially animation. It just looks sloppy and some of them look like they repeat a different action.3) Tech and boasts locked behind ""play wall"". So quite similar to a paywall where you pay real money to unlock certain tech and stuff in a free to play game, King Wars 2: Battles thought it would engage its playerbase by locking new tech and upgrades behind what I call a ""play wall"" during the main menu of the game. Meaning, you'll have to grind in this game via singleplayer, multiplayer, or whatever to gain gems, chests, or whatever resource in this game that could be only obtained from finishing a full match in this game. You can spend said resources on the main menu where there is myriad of unlocks for the three races presented in this game. Some people don't have time for this grind and it just puts you off because it feel force feed of ""yes we want you to play this game a very long time to get everything"" versus most RTS games put the tech and upgrades inside the game via a special building like a blacksmith, engineering bay, etc. But nope, not Kingdom Wars 2: Battles, they want to put a play wall instead of putting it inside the game where you unlock all these things inside the match like most RTS games do.4) The zombies aspect is not fully fleshed out, and quite frankly it needs a lot of work. Sometimes it doesn't feel it's working right and at other times the AI for the zombies is just stupid. Like it feels they attack anything and anyone, they don't have really anything special about them. They just feel ""there"" and you can't direct them in any sort of way in the game. You would think since this is a kind of a reference to a fantasy/medieval type theme, the three races in this game would at least attempted some way to use the zombies as a weapon against their foes. Nope, instead they are just FFA type enemies that spawn after troops are killed in battle via your or the enemy side.5) UNITS: This is a big problem for me, I do not like the way each unit is grouped and bunched with each other. A lot of RTS has a unit spawn, say, a barracks one by one, and not in a group for a reason. In a RTS games, you will want to mix somme elements with another via drag and click and group them to hotkey in the form of 1 2 3 4 5. . . . . However, in Kingdom Wars 2: Battles all the units spawn in groups, so really when they are walking around your castle etc. they may get stuck, and in other times it is confusing when you are running a siege because  you just have all these globs everywhere.6) Sieges and AI feel really bad. I mean sometimes the AI can attack you REALLY early, and sieges are really hard to manage. It just feels feels like a grind breaking down the enemies walls and fighting their army, and vice-versa once your base is invaded you pretty much lost.VERDICT: Yes I gave this game a thumbs up, but I did harshly criticize some of the design decisions of this game. King Wars 2: Battles does bring something new to the table and they took everything from a RTS game and completely took a different direction. It will heavily depend on whether or not the player can adapt to these changes. On a more positive note, the developers are constantly updating and supporting this game no matter how much flak it gets or how much people bicker and cry how about this game, they love this game like it is their baby, and I respect that. I also felt I had a valid reason for making these criticism since I did pay a premimum price for this title only to support them, and they did lower the base price to 18.99. However, I will praise this studio, they aren't giving up, and despite all the commotion and ""rioting"" they still struck on to mold this baby into the soon to come master-piece they envisioned. This game has come a long way, from early access, now to a full-released product, and they still say, were gonna work on this game and show everyone that were not going to stop until everyone is satisfied. I kid you not when I say a lot of other studios would have quit and thrown in the towel, probably put a premium price tag  on their game and disappear and years down the road suddenly release another game. I've seen studios who have done this, simply abandon one game and create aother one when the first few months look bleak, and often times their catalog of games always have the same mixed review rating because of vicious cycle. But not Reverie World Studios, INC. they stand by their product and look to truck away onwards and upwards until this game meets everyone expectation, and for that, I thank you, and say good luck."

This is an impulse buy at its finest. The single player maps are just you with the NPC already having a base made and ready for attack (mind you it's not a campain map) My first playthrough went a little like this...Start out inside wooden walls, build a few villagers and tell them to gather the resources, basic stuff... But then it gets better; I build an archery range and buy some bowmen. There are a group of neutral ogres just chilling outside my base, so I use my bowmen (just made, lvl 1 no upgrades) to kill all 8 of them, just kited them around and thought ""well that was easy"" but then I scroll to the left a bit more and there are a **** ton of wolves atleast 300 of the damn things. Thought ""Maybe this will be harder"". (When have you ever know wolves to stay in a pack that big?) regardless... my bowmen wipe them out easy no problem (Still the same bowmen, lvl 1 no upgrades) so after my 20 bowmen wipe out 300 wolves, I decide to actually build my base. First attempt I build a mill, villagers get stuck inside and I have to delete them... After that I build a house, villagers get stuck again, delete them also....  Then I quit the game, just couldn't take it anymore, and proceeded to play Age of Empires.Pros:The devs seem nice I guess ++Exit button is easy to find... +++Cons:UI: Non existent UI (Only when the building is selected and its just an eye sore) --Units: all the same and walk like a bunch of dumb stiff♥♥♥♥♥♥♥---Tutorial: I said ""What?"" and ""Why am I doing this?"" too much...

Your AI opponents have access to all the good stuff right off the bat, but you're as helpless as a babe in the woods. You won't make it through the tortuous tutorial campaign unless you are the kind of person who loves being wide awake while the dentist laughs evilly while he drills on your morals, so you enter the game clueless. You haplessly build up a city thinking that you are doing all the right stuff and all of a sudden your opponent(s) have dragons ripping you a new anal orifice. Dragons? Where the f did they get dragons? I'm still trying to figure out how to mine more gold, you say to yourself.  This game is an incredible lesson in humility, because you cannot win without losing, a lot, first.My inner masochist gives this 10 thumbs up."

Elves which are your best defensive faction because of their self-sustaining economy and strong wall fortifications, also invisible archers which are a pain. Orcs which are supposedly good at rushing but it doesn't normally work out for me, thankfully the orcs are also a strong faction in mid game with powerful offensive units, I believe they are the only faction with non-siege units that are effective at breaking gates down (ogres and minotaurs). There are also 3 mercenary unit factions that are fun to play around with (Dwarves, Dragons and now Undead). The gameplay is fun as feels like a mixture of Age of Empires, Stronghold and other classic RTS games. Graphics are outdated but you get accustom to them in time, especially if you are an old-school RTS player. Be warned this isn't a game you should jump directly into multiplayer in, its highly advised you play at least some of the campaign missions and some skirmish games first. As their is a tech-tree system that requires different crafting components you use to invest in. I believe you start with a fair amount of crafting components now to research some of the tech tree but this is an important point because without the tech tree research, you will be at a large disadvantage in multiplayer and unable to build the majority of your units / upgrades."

Although The graphics are not spectacular, there are some bugs and glitches, units are hard to read, and rough, but still responsive controls, The gameplay of this game is really fun! Why is this game fun; because you can play with your friends in survival mode, You can play against people in 1v1 games, you can do team battles or awesome free for all mode, you can literally siege your opponent base with siege towers, trebuchets, catapults, many more siege weapons and the battles are messy, but Epic, the combat is pretty fun too, which make the game more engaging. Even the zombies make this game fun because if your or enemy units die then they have a chance of becoming a zombie which could hurt you more or your opponent if you don't deal with the corpses.Yes, the game have generic fantasy tropes and have ton of generic rts mechanics, but there are few original mechanics like the card system, tech system and the MMOlike elements of guilds, trade, and social. Even though this game is average, I think average games are sometimes worth the purchase.And this game is worth it.Really interested in what the future for this game.

The whole game is.. just.... meh. The graphics i have to admit are pretty good for this game and all the models look great but that is all. I love the diverse upgrade/ research system you have out of game, it was a nice suprise, but the actual gameplay is sluggish from the slow camera rotation/movement to to almost sloth=like motivatino of the people you control. Their lines feel written for 6 year olds even with vulger language filter turned off and how the peasants and more so the soldiers move and interact is... un-inspiring to say the least other than being bad and unrealistic even for a RTS game. Soldier awareness and how they attack is not the best and tbh this game is very sluggish with control interface and unit command response, on top of that here seems to be no que system for building. For a peaceful RTS game if you can get past the giltchy lighting effects (especially lightning) and don't mind the bad A.I. this game is for you.Idk what to say really, i mean how you have humans, orcs and elves races to play as which i love how that's a thing along with multiplayer survival mode against motherf%&*ing zombies!!!!!! I have nothing strong against the game, it's not terrible, but even when i say ""it's ok"" i say that with little enthusiasm and a very ""meh"" attitude.  The game just doesn't cut it for someone who loves RTS and is also lookign for a decent RTS medievil game... OH UMM forgot to add about the frequent glitchy screen freezes and jumps, how the a.i. is pretty dead/broken and yeah very glitchy FPS. FYI no nothing is wrong with my computer it is more than godo enough to run and i'm not the only one with these issues.If this game peeks your interest buy it and give it a go. I woudl say wait until a sale, like at least 30% and also try it within 14 days and straightaway within 2 hours play and decide if you want to keep it or else after 2 hours you ain't getting a refund... i found that out the hard way with another game.

Thinking carefully where to spent your rare Resources and what Unit to build and where to place the Unit. There's only the ""Slow-Motion-Feature""  which ending me playing the whole game in slowmo, what is rather redicilous. Me personally can't even read the discrption of what differnt Buttons dp and what Upgrades they prduce before pounded to dust... and that's on Easy-Mode and Slow-Mo...2.) Same goes for the Second Point. I hate, I really hate games with ""Timers""... e.g. You have X-Minutes before Y happens... Mainly that means attacking something... and as mentioned before I like to play from a strong Base. E.G. Securing a Strong Base which can defend itself, perhaps produces some Resources and than turn over to the Attack Mission. That's not, at least for me, possiple.3.) The Suvival ModeThis could be funny: Facing endless Hordes of Undead until you finaly go down... but all Cards are the SAME. You can select e.G. Desert or Coastal Cards... but... they all the same only with different textures... and by the way, because of 1.) and 2.) I didn't survive the firts Night (with the Humans). The Elves are somewaht easier because the Resources are in their Keep and not outside like with te Humans. The Orcs I disn't try.4.) Online Connection RequiredI hate it if Games are requiring you to be online to play. Sure, there is a button to turn ths ""feature"" off, but first yoz have to be online to start the game, get to the Main Menur and hit this f*cking Button. Personally I think this Online♥♥♥♥♥♥is  a very-very-very bad modern thing. I don't give a damn about Multiplayer, why san't that be respected?Okay... if you like fast Action and do have a very high Frustration Treshold than maybe you could get some Fun out of it.

It's huge!Bought it for about 6$ and the game was fun in campaign for a while. But it has a lot of bugs and some are gamebreaking. It uses only 25% of a quad cpu and stutters like crazy seemingly out of nowhere and there is no fix for it other than a seemingly bad engine. Pathfinding is also very buggy, units get stuck in walls, rivers, under bridges etc and make your archers shoot at them forever. I played it for about 30 hours but half that time was trying stuff to solve the gamebreaking stuttering.The devs are pretty active but they seem to spend more time selling the game with borderline false advertising and moving all bugreports away from the general discussion that they use for a ""sales channel"". So take a long good read in the Bug Reports section before you buy.I didnt even get around to try the multiplayer which i read is pretty bad (you dont play the same game because of desync issues).This game and the way the devs answer the ""unknowing"" potential customers gives me a lot of ""Red Flags"" aka the WarZ case. Even the voiceover guy sounds like he is about to burst into laughter at any moment and he gives you the feeling that you are playing a parody.Stronghold 3 and Stronghold Crusader 2 are much better games and all the Age of Empires. Heck, even ""Craft the World"" are better spending time on. Dont even try comparing this mess to Warhammer."

(Basicly I'm against paying for an unfinished product because it removes the motivation to finish the game).I bought the game because it was supposed to be a mix of Total War and Stronghold. IT IS NOT.Well, first of it is VERY buggy, and when i say VERY, I mean VERY buggy. It took me almost 3 hours just to make the game launch, and when it finally did it lagged alot during the intro scene and narrating.  It annoyed me so much that i had to quit after only 20 mins of gameplay.Since this is early access you would have to live with a few bugs, thats true, and the bugs arent the reason why Im not recommending the game. But besides this being an early access game, it simply looks and feels like it was released 10-15 years ago. Animations are ugly and the game feels clumsy. There is no real introduction to the game, so you just have to learn by playing.Game graphics looks like a mix of The Settlers 3 and Age of Mythology, with the feel of Age of Empires II. Might not sound like a bad mix, but for a game made in 2015 thats just not good enough.I asked for a refund, think and research before you buy this game."

This is more of a castle siege game which gives you limited map control with defensive buildings.The UI for me is very slow to resopond, and I am running a high end gaming machine.The AI is unrelentless, I have been playing some single player on easy and I get rushed and harrased so bad.

And it's true, the construction is a highlight of the game. Watching the walls go up, expanding the walls, and reinforcing the walls with defences is very fun. That was the only fun part of the game I could find.The many bugs made the game frustriating. the graphics are painful and the saturation is driven up to hide it. The UI is a mess. Units aquire skill points, which means you have to go to each group of units and distribute their skillpoints one at a time. The AI is bad, and the neutral outposts seem to be pointless.The Combat AI really made it unplayable though. Telling melee units to attack a unit, they will attack exactly that unit, and only that unit, even if they need to walk behind 3 lines of enemies to get to him. You can't even form a wall to prevent the enemy from walking past you, not that the AI would anyway. Just stick with archers who at least autoattack. Worse, there are no formations or advanced orders. The best you can do is tell your units to form a line facing one direction or another, making combat tactics paper thin.I expected fewer poor design choices and bugs from an indy studio.Pros:-Cool wall construction and upgrade machanics ++-Old school style resource collection +-Old school style unit design+Cons:-Bad map AI, Worse combat AI --Blinding graphics and saturation ---Frustrating glitches --Lack of formations or complex strategy ----Old school unit design -Verdict:Don't believe the fanboyst. Unless you really want to built walls stay away, even at 50% off."

Also when you play the campaign that is where i get the hours in and it is not good hours in the is so much graphics lag for this game even though they said they patched it still is laggy play for battles.
