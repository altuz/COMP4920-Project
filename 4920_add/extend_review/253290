76561198140299850,Recommended,253290,15098068,"Posted: 28 March, 2015",all,foofaraw,"FOTONICA is an adrenaline rush, at the very least. A high speed running game with one button as the sum total of a player’s control. Don’t think of that as a limitation. Quite the opposite. Since this is first and foremost a sensory experience type of game, deriving much from little, it would be unfortunate if even the smallest part of a player’s attention were taken from the screen.The player, as “runner”, travels very minimalistic landscapes. Some are vaguely identifiable, such as rooms in a sort of building. (The more identifiable the terrain, the faster landscapes seem to go by as the eye/brain connection struggles for context.) The runner also jumps, but I hesitate to call this a platformer. It does have platformer characteristics, such as the pink dots one attempts to acquire by contact. And the varying size and levels of platforms. Some game levels, in fact, are almost entirely platforms. These are generally the more difficult; as players struggle to attain the secondary goal, SPEED.The primary goal of FOTONICA is scoring points. Every run scores points, even those ending in failure (carefully recorded on the Statistics screen.) Points are composed of distance traveled, dots attained and how much of the distance was in “gold” mode, above 60 mps. (There may be exceptions beyond the lower levels I’ve seen so far.) There are numerous levels, each beyond the first being unlocked through performance (so I hesitate to give too many details.) As well, there are 4 skill levels. Though they have Italian names, I presume them to be Agile, Energetic, Furious and Impetuous. Perhaps someone can clarify. Each game level at each skill level has its own leaderboard. A player can seek their own ranking, overall, or compare with any friends that have played. In addition to Arcade mode, composed of various tracks or terrains to run, there is Endless (presumably as described, though hitting 10,000 points (oddly enough) does indicate “completion”, but not the end. Each Arcade level also has a point of completion in which the player joyously jumps into a world of horizontal lines, not tracks or platforms.) FOTONICA also includes a third mode, multiplayer, which I am unable to comment on at this time.Each skill level is essentially an increase in speed, requiring different paths and strategies, often seeming almost as if a completely new level of the game involving new terrains. That’s the real excitement of FOTONICA, finding the BEST (perhaps only) path to the end, by exploring all the possibilities at the various speeds. Hints are offered. Sometimes the placement of a pink dot can offer a clue, as can the position of flag-like markers to indicate a jumping point. But be careful, sometimes a dot seems, at least at certain speeds, to sucker you into a dead end move.Very often the appropriate path or action is counterintuitive, such as jumping before maximum speed, in order to land more strategically. Or kicking off instead of running, for a similar purpose. Strange as it may sound, all movement is, as mentioned earlier, controlled by one button, ANY button. But that button does even more. It also controls landing from each leap, presumably to provide a smoother, less momentum disrupting transition. When at some point a leap goes too far, “the button” will also act to land the runner sooner (though at a cost to speed) to avoid leaping into space, the most common conclusion to a run. (After two days I have nearly 1,000 such “space leaps”.)In real life I can’t run without a price, and have been severely limited in doing so for about 40 years. Perhaps that increases my enjoyment of this game. For others with limitations this game is nearly perfect with its simplicity of control and color. It also offers a feature by which a player can offset the timing of their input, in either direction, by 2 degrees each. This feature certainly deserves examination by any player, impaired or not.The achievements are interesting and esoteric. One, in fact, is a total mystery, and the developers AREN’T talking. Ultimately what’s not to love in a game that gives an achievement for a huge number of face plants at high speed? (Which, incidentally, frequently leads to new discoveries.)A great game to be played with or without external controls, for a minute or for hours. Portrait mode is suggested, though you’ll need familiarity with the menus first, as it seems to have been an afterthought. Perhaps not the greatest of its type, but a darn good one that I certainly suggest, especially if it’s still so cheap. Hope to see you there."

With little to almost no change to the typical platforming/running formula something unique can be created only by giving its levels a minimalistic gridwire look and fitting electronica soundtrack to create a specific theme for each stage.Running at humanly impossible speeds feels just amazing, while you need to adjust running speed, time your jumps and dives right to survive to the next platform. The learning curve may be a bit steep, but as with all those games, they feel rewarding ever so much when you finally get it right.Santa Ragione has created something unique for them and I can applaud them for their job well done. You cannot make a wrong decision with buying this game, even if you just want to take it a bit more casually. Give it a try!Design & ArtMinimalistic art for a minimalistic game. While playing, visuals never feel overloaded but always sufficient for the established gameplay mechanics of FOTONICA. I would not call a wireframe look particularly innovative or interesting though. Luckily a possibility to change the overall appearance of the game exists.The levels of FOTONICA are distinctly unique and surprisingly well themed. Each of them lets you take a plethora of possible routes leading to the end. Finding the way that is manageable plus rewarding enough at the same time is up to the player.Sound & MusicThe mostly electronica soundtrack was composed by three individual composers and fits to a T. Each of the tracks lends a theme to their respective level and creates a sense of uniqueness. Visuals and audio go hand in hand here in my opinion and fit each other perfectly.Unfortunately, some notes are really high pitched and shrill and disrupt the otherwise marvelous soundtrack. Not only that, in some cases during my playthrough, sounds were not played when they were needed to which ended in some confusion. Apart from these minor bugs, an excellent combination of soundtrack, visual appearance and gameplay in my opinion.GameplayFOTONICA focuses, more than other typical runner games, on correct timing and appropriate running speed. You control your runner through one key only, which, while on the ground accelerates the player and on release makes him jump. In the air, the button initiates a dive through the air, making it easier to land correctly.Completing levels simply will not cut it, you need to find the best route through each of them and survive in order to break the approriate highscore. Testing your tenacity in three extra endless levels against other players or against up to four players directly in local splitscreen will leave you with much content to play around.Each level also has four difficulty levels that do not increase the difficulty by altering the level, but by increasing the game speed and making reaction time windows tighter instead. A really interesting approach.Personal Bonus vs. Penalty (10 points max)BonusAddictive gameplay, that pushes you to the edges of your patience (never feels impossible though, approx. 10 to 20 hours of playtime)Uniquely themed stages with fitting respective soundtracksEndless levels to push your limitsInteresting and working concept for increasing the difficultyConvincing feeling of speed, feels very good to look at running speeds humanly impossiblePenaltiesSome audio bugs and shrill noisesMastering a level on one difficulty will make it easier to complete it on other difficulties, because the routes stay mostly the sameVery little replay value, no additional randomized content next to endless modes"

It strives to capture the same sense of speed and momentum while remaining visceral and intuitive by simplifying it's controls to a single button.FOTONICA thrives of the complexity of its levels and the best parts of its gameplay only emerge at higher difficulties. When traveling at incredible speeds with multiple paths ahead of you the game loses the feeling of platforming and truly starts to emulate the euphoric velocity fueled fever dream it sells its self as.The elegant fluidity of its single button controls shine in these moments, allowing you interact with the game in a responsive and satisfying  way while remaining immersed. Unless you have on the input delay. Seriously, the input delay ""interferes"" with the experience in the same way a frying pan to the back of the head ""interferes"" with meditation.So far I only have a little more than an hour clocked in the game, so I can't speak to its continued ability to induce the much sought after state of abstract techno zen.

The graphics remind me of what a child of the early 80's would think future video games would prolly look like. The Music is very good. Jumping from platforms can be exciting as your characters arms move around like he/she/it is trying to balance themselves. But with all that said, the biggest problem this game has is that it gets boring very fast. Now let me explain this.Basically you are running along a narrow path the entire time, gaining speed, jumping onto platforms, through Trippy retro computer like enviroments. It looks nice. But the problem i have is with how the game plays. You only press ONE BUTTON the entire time, holding the button(Any button) down makes your character speed up, and letting go of the button makes him jump. The longer you go without pressing ""the button"" , the longer your character will glide through the air untill they reach the ground. If in the air, you decide to push down on ""the button"", your character will promptly rush to the ground. Your Main objective is to run and jump onto different plaforms, all the while maintaining your speed and not running off any of the platforms, for that will restart the level. This type of game design works well , and the game functions as intented, but it gets old sooooo fast. Any normal person would get bored very quickly, unless your a 15-20 year old stoner that likes ""trippy visuals"" and listening to Tangerine Dream. Fotonica is interesting and i commend the devs for making something unique, but i feel the average person would get bored very quickly. and it's asking price of $10 is way to steep for the lack of gameplay and limited amount of levels.If you like to pay daily visits to your local  independent pharmaceutical salesman for the latest in pizza toppings, then this game might be for you, but for everyone else , i wouldnt recommend this it."

I've already beaten it. I know that there are more difficulty levels and an endless mode, but I somehow expected a little more from a game that normally asks $10.It has a nice visual aesthetic, but at times only being able to see the outlines of objects can make it a pain in the ass to gauge whether you're about to jumpontoorinto the side ofa pathway, or just straight into a hole.The music has no inherent flaws, but the tracks are all short and have obvious points at which they loop that you'll undoubtedly begin to notice quickly as you are forced to restart time and time again, making the levels drag on. Also few of the songs are truly high-energy enough to do the game's ""high energy"" feel any actual justice, and some are downright annoying after a bit.For a one-button game I'd expect something like this to show up on iOS/Google Play Store, for $1, for mobile phones-- and probably succeed nicely there as well, as it's a fun game to play in very short bursts when you're bored-- but I personally don't feel it holds up as a pc game, even one that's currently marked down to about $2."

The gameplay is extremely simple - you hold down a button to speed up, let go to jump, and can hold down again in the air to accelerate your fall back to the ground. Despite this, it has a fairly steep difficulty curve  - I've only completed all the levels on the easiest setting. It's a simple, arcadey experience.If I have one complaint, it's that I feel there are too few levels.

,Recommended,253290,29750680,Posted: 6 February,all,PapaDelta138,"So, one time,TRONandThe Flashmet at a bar, withTemple Runserving them some drinks...That's like the very raw idea I got when I playedFOTONICA.The game is a first-person endless platform runner with geometrical visuals, and a really soothing soundtrack, with little controls. It gives off the feeling of a mobile game, because most mobile games are designed this way - with a one-touch playstyle. But, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, because this game could be one of those games with which you could sit back and relax with. Also, it's very enjoyable.Gameplay:So, it's got three modes - Endless, Arcade, and Versus. You'll get the idea from just reading them. But, let's get down to brass tacks. It's a first-person endless platform runner game, in which you sprint for miles and miles until you crash and lose. You have only one button to use, any button really, to jump over or dive under obstacles. The faster you go, the harder it gets to reach your destination (in arcade), and also the sooner the game changes colour (literally). I've actually played a game similar to this one, but it's not nearly as polished, or as upbeat as this one. So, even if the concept is not new, this game has used that concept the best so far.Visuals:It's like I'm inTRON. Like, legit. It's as if they made the game with just the object frameworks, and just went ""this looks better, let's leave it like this"", because they couldn't come up with good models to use or something. I'm probably just spit-balling here. But, it actually did work. It worked with the ambience of the game. Everything fits. So, yeah. You wouldn't have to worry about brilliant visuals, because even aSamsung Galaxy S7would run it nicely without exploding, and it would still look brilliant.Mechanics:Nothing to go on with this one. I expected there would be mouse control, to look around or something. Or maybe I could have a diving move, or a jumping move separately made. Or there would even be the usual WASD controls. But, there is none. Press any button, and you speed up. Release the button, and you slow down. Doesn't matter what button you use, those are the controls. It was too simplistic for my taste. And eventually, it will be tiresome.Soundtrack:One of the things you gotta buy the game for. It's got really good tunes, even though it's electronic (I'm a metal/rock fan). But, hey, atleast it doesn't sound badat all!coughunlike deadmau5cough... In fact, it will help you immerse yourself into the game. Nothing like a calm but happy beat keeping your ears busy as you run to victory!Verdict:It's more like a mobile game than a PC game, even if it can get somewhat addictive with its playstyle, because of its primitive mechanics, and overall experience, but I think it's still worth the buy ...but strictly during sale. It's one of the few platform runner games which has got some decent stuff to provide. I can totally imagine this with VR support. And even though it sucks that there's little to no diversity with the controls, implementing a few stuff (camera controls for instance) in the next game would be an awesome thing."

Main fustration is the minimialist visuals working against the gameplay as jumps from upcoming platforms are often times very hard to time properly. The floaty jump takes sometime to get used to as well, but in the end of it all when it clicks there does seem to be a method to these strange design choices. When you start going really fast jumping from ledge to ledge (on what seems like faith? maybe just in the zone?) it really does invoke a raw visceral thrill of speed."

,Recommended,253290,17305459,"Posted: 30 July, 2015",all,N E G A Z U L,"I bought it this morning, it was both on sale and on my list, so why not.I bought it for for some challenge, regardless of the overall experience.POSITIVE :And I have to admit I'm hooked ! I produce electronic music, so I always pay attention to sound-design. Most of the games I play have either no sound-design like Super Hexagon, or a really awful one, like Hero Siege and those mp3-quality swords and voices.And here, it's clean as hell, I was very surprised and very delighted ! Voices and shouts, breathing, motion, it's very, very precise and well-designed. And music is so good. I like this abstract, but heartful modern design.I went thru the first levels, nothing difficult, you run, you jump, with one button. It's not about the gameplay and the difficulty. You have to find the perfect timing (and you can take 4-5 different paths every level) for catch all the red circles and reach 10k points. You'll access next level without 10k points, and even if I think it's a mistake (at least for me), it keeps the game doable for somebody who don't want to play the same level for hours.Default difficulty is 2, then 3 and 4, I'd have like 5, definitely.I think this game is about the pleasure of execute each jump with perfect timing, not for the performance or achievement but for feeling it. Feel the air, the gravity, and the overall quality of the way you move, of the code they wrote.If you want a challenge and only this, it's not for you, you'll beat the game, you'll say it's easy and it isn't worth 9 bucks. I  think I would not buy it this price, since I'm more skill-side. But for 1,70 Euro, I have fresh air in my hands, thru a unique game.ABOUT GAMEPLAY :I read a review about the fact that you only have to push one key for running, and release it for jumping. And the fact it's boring, and it gets old really fast. In fact, you can change the behaviour of the game and frankly, it really changes the way you play. Default is touch/release gameplay, but in the options, you can change it : it will run automatically, and it will jump when you press.NEGATIVE :- Each time the jump ends and I'm back on track, it's difficult to see what's in front of me. It's really immersive, yes, for the better and the worse. I just have to stick with it and to get used to it but still, I consider this is annoying.- Why always black background and white/gold people and road ? It gets visually boring really fast. I think one can maintain this minimalist look all the game, and still can make it more interesting for the player. It's kinda weird I'm saying this because I actually enjoy the overall look of this game, but... I dunno, I feel it deserves more spice.So, I probably won't play more than a few minutes between two games. Or maybe I'll take a day for exploring it in depth and see what lies there. But definitely, for 9 bucks, it lacks something. Say, I would have loved a voice from time to time, since the shouts of the runner are so greatly designed. Or random events. Or something which breaks the rythm you take after one or two levels. Beginning/Straight-up level/End. Not so much.If you're still there (I don't write short reviews, sorry), should you buy this game ?Yes. Even for 9 bucks : the last game I played with this amazing feeling of sound-design clarity was Skyrim, one year ago. So even if you don't like the game, see it like a gesture for an amazing sound-designer."
,Recommended,253290,16408160,"Posted: 14 June, 2015",all,Ibaudia,"Is it worth 10 bucks? Hell no. Only get this if it's on sale.That said, this game has a sort of intoxicating quality to it, something that most AAA titles seem to lack, and a lot of indie games with similar mechanics (such as Super Hexagon and Boson X, just to name a few), carry quite frequently. Regardless of that, though, Fotonica still feels unique because of its artstyle, suprisingly innovative one-button gameplay, calming soundtrack, and beautiful, diverse levels. While all these things have been done before, none of them have been incorporated into one game so expertly. Fotonica deserves your time if not only for that.There are issues with the game, though; most notably how the artstyle interferes with your ablility to see platforms at a distance when playing on a smaller resolution monitor, and other things of that nature that really can't be helped, but said things never bothed me, even if they did end up hindering my experience. That was because the game itself, in combination with all of the elements that I listed previously, ended up being so relaxing that I just stopped caring about any objective flaws I might have come across. Maybe that's because the flaws just weren't very significant, but regardless of whether or not that's true, this game gets two thumbs up from me.Whether you're a casual or hardcore gamer, I strongly recommend Fotonica if you feel like destressing or just having some fun with an artsy little experience."

For the multiplayer mode, both players need to hold down the button for a couple seconds for the match to start. we have probably spent more time holding the button down just until the bar is about to fill up and then letting go than actually playing the game. if you got an evening to kill i'd recommend seeing whether guerilla toss is playing in your town. if they are not, then i'd recommend playing fotonica. this game embodies the spirit of guerilla toss because the name is written in all-caps and therefore sounds like it is being shouted by kassie carlson. we love you kassie."

So I guess I should say during the Inaugural Lunar Sale. Sales aside, I was immediately pulled in by FOTONICA’s really interesting wireframe style, and impressive sense of speed!The game’s details ask you if you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to run at 140mph. The answer to that question is: “Not until right now.”The game was, and still is, on sale for a whopping $1.99. So I immediately jumped at the opportunity to play this game. And I have to say I love it. I’m not much of an endless runner kind of guy. But the first person perspective, interesting graphics, and break-neck speed were really fun to experience.Also this game is hart wie Scheiße. one wrong move and you have to start the entire run over… Also no check points.I was playing this game about a week ago, and well… a game hasn’t made my palms sweat in a really long time. Not even Dark Souls. Apparently I was way into it. Sweaty palms, weak knees, heavy arms, sans Mom’s Spaghetti.I really enjoy this game’s sense of speed, and the challenge of running through a new level trying to figure out the timing you need to pull off in order to advance is quite enjoyable. For the most part.Most of my play time was probably stuck on one or two levels. THEY’RE SO DAMN HARD! I went into this game expecting it to be relaxing! Don’t get me wrong, it can be for sure… But, damn it’s rough sometimes. You really have to be on point to get through most of the game. Jump to early, miss the platform. Jump too late, hit the platform. Either way you’re falling into an endless void longingly reaching out to accept you.The dream like sound design, and calming music betray that fact that this game will really screw you over if you’re not paying attention.Fun Fact: your decreasing altitude is inversely proportional to your blood pressure.Overall I really enjoyed my time with FOTONICA and would recommend it to anyone that really enjoys endless runner type games. However, the game is normally listed at $10! Which I feel is a little too expensive for the price, considering what is available. There are about eight or nine arcade levels, and three endless levels. All of which can be played on a variety of difficulties.Interestingly you can also play with up to four other people, which is nice! But I don’t think that’s enough content to justify the $10 price. I would say it’s more along the $5 to $7 range.So just keep that in mind. I would say if you’re interested, and like endless runners definitely give this one a chance. It’s super cool, well made, and pretty trippy, yo.Like this review? Check out more at100HourSave.com"

(Thankfully it's not actually dubstep, as another reviewer has erroniously written.) The controls are responsive and engaging as well, and suit the sort of first-person-unicorn-dash gameplay that the designers chose.And that brings me to my one major gripe. Unlike Rez, whose arcade shooter game style was challenging and varied, FOTONICA is pretty much a one-trick pony. The single-button control scheme (somehow incompatible with the XB360 controller - whether through laziness or evil) means that each level amounts to repetitive trial and error with the ultimate goal of course memorization. This in turn means that in order to progress in the game, you will need to know each level so well that the element of urgency and adrenaline (an area where this game excels) is pretty much lost. Nor are the collectibles an entertaining distraction; there is only one variety, an inornate red sphere. This, plus the lack of checkpoints and the game's tendency to put the most difficult obstacles at the end of each course, is why I can't recommend this game.TL:DR?It's not completely non-fun, but probably fun and non-fun in equal measure."

The once colorless background and properties now turn into yellow-ish ones with a neat but sometimes distracting and bugging animation.Music & SoundFilled with electronica soundtracks made by Michael Manning, Nicolô Sala and Baiyon, the game lacks other sorts of music, which is kind of sad.Some of you will argue, that this is no big deal but i would like to have some variety in fast-paced games.Apart from the music, there are only a few other sound in the game -->  running-sound, a jump-sound coupled with a human ""hugh""-sound, sound of your body hitting the floor or an object, sound of collecting bubbles and a sound when reaching ""Golden Speed"".GameplayThere´s not much to do in FOTONICA.The game is divided into four chapters/difficulties and eight different levels.You run in a straight line for the entirety of the game while jumping and collecting bubbles.While running, jumping and falling you increase your speed as long as you dont hit any objects with your face.At a certain speed-level you reach the so-called ""Golden Speed"" where everything around you turn yellow-ish/golden and your momentum builds up even faster.Like all other aspects in the game, the controls are minimalistic, too.Just hold down a button to build up momentum, release it to jump and hold it again in mid-air to dive and land.Apart from running and jumping you can collect red ""bubbles"" to increase your score.They are scattered all over the track and are more or less hard to collect, while trying to finish the race.tl;drA rather unique-looking game about running, jumping and competing against other, trying to get the Highscore of a level.With its minimalistic and easy controls it is engaging for casual and ""highscore""-gamers.I would say it´sWorth a try"

Played more than just 40 mins, but my Steam doesn't always like to sync for some reason.THE GOOD-Incredibly immersive and intuitive - literally two controls ""On"" and ""Off"". Run or Don't.-Landing is simple, and jumping is easy to judge (see the bad for a brief comment on this, though)-Music is appropriate and helps keep ya going.-You know when, in Mirror's Edge, you'd get a really good string of perfect jumps and mounts, gaining speed and flowing through the world in one of the best gameplay experiences ever? Remember how rarely that happened and how often it was unpleasantly cut off? Well, the only way it happens here is if you screw up or fall into oblivion.THE BAD-when you go Super Saiyan and the screen goes♥♥♥♥♥♥Yellow, the sudden speedup pushes you forwards, and can make you 'misjudge' your landing. This can be day-ruining in frustration.-The 'dots' or Pacman Pills or whatever they are - the fastest route doesn't follow this and is a tad arbitrary, though enjoyable most of the time.-Making the sides of a linear path wobbly to make the map drastically different does not a cake make.-bit more variance? Maybe some aesthetic variance? Sure, the look is good, but a bit of something more 'out there' might be worth considering in the future.-collision with ledges can be hard to judge at times. Whether or not you automatically mount is sometimes just 'up in the air'.I am big on first-person parkour and this simplifies everything to core principles, and then turns the simple result to 11. Thoroughly enjoyable and worth playing. 6-6.5/10. Would pay full price."

,Recommended,253290,13775886,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,samppa,"Your only objective is to run through maps constructed of simple white lines over an endless black void.You hold down one button to run and as you run you gain more speed. It's never explained why you're running but when you really think about it, does it even matter. You try to reach the horizon and that's what's important. Letting go of the run button sends you leaping into the sky and pressing it down again makes you hit the ground, which is how you make your way through the tracks of empty highways, apartment buildings, a forest, whatever. The game emphasises the importance of landing after you jump up. It's pretty important.All of the Arcade Mode maps eventually end with you reaching the finish line and then falling into the same emptiness you were maybe trying to run away from. It's kind of philosophical, really.After I had played through all the maps I found out the game comes with different difficulty levels but I feel like they make very little difference. After you learn to land your jumps properly, it doesn't matter how fast the game moves because you can nail the jumps anyway.I guess like most running games, FOTONICA rewards you for not bumping into things. If you try to jump for a higher ledge but you don't have enough speed, you will smash against it and lose momentum. If you run well you gain speed and you can see the white lines around you change color. The best and most thrilling moments of FOTONICA are those where you run towards a ledge at great speed, everything around you shining in gold, you can hear the music get more intense and you see the road end in front of you and beyond that there's nothing but the empty void, so you just have to go for it.Run to the very end of the ledge, let go of the keyboard, take the leap of faith and hope your jump will carry you on to the other side. If you don't make it you just need to try again from the beginning.FOTONICA is no Mirror's Edge but you should probably still play it."

Harding,"FOTONICA is a special game, when I first got this game, I thought I could use it as a means to pass time when looking for  Ranked Match on the League of Legends. And FOTONICA did this very well. The game just feels like a one direction temple run with only jumping, and that it comes at a price. Although rather overpriced for a game like this, it is actually rather good. But can be easily outmatched by other time wasting indie games or popular platform games like Tetris. It feels like a game that could easily be ported to Mobile devices, which is a good thing, making it cross platforms. I just think the price should go down for the PC.I'd rate it 7/10"

,Recommended,253290,33370661,Posted: 8 July,all,slingmasta,"Bushnell's Law is an aphorism which describes how the best video games should be or often are ""easy to learn and difficult to master."" Fotonica nails this law. What you have is one of the most simple games I've ever seen, with a challenging but rewarding learning curve. Essentially, you hold down a button to run forward, release it to jump, and hold it down again to land and continue onward. The game's objective is to reach the end of a level by jumping across platforms as fast as possible without missing and falling into the void below. On easier difficulties, a slower running pace means that even a complete novice could ace any of the games levels within a few attempts. Ramping up the difficulty to the harder levels sees the player's avatar running at breakneck speeds where even a slight mistake or flaw in the player's execution means a restart.Fotonica is a game that will challenge and reward regardless of the time put into it. Buy it on sale for a dollar or two and have you've got a great casual game to play while waiting for downloads or updates. Or, go nuts and spend hours on hours perfecting the game and learning its intricacies. At the end of the day, Fotonica is addicting and satisfying, with solid mechanics, outstanding visuals and a grooving minimal soundtrack to boot. You can't go wrong here."
