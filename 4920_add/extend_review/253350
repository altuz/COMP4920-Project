He contemplates the shifting of the sands, the hungry gleam in vultures' eyes, and the sweet brutal revenge he must take. Break free in as dramatic a way as possible! Your adventure begins!Within 15 seconds of playing, you'll have savaged the local wildlife, defiled ancient ruins, and most likely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about a dozen evil warlocks just by being alive. A few steps later you'll already be discovering secrets as you bash through cracking rocks to uncover coins, gems, and... meat! Collect treasure for score, and replenish health by eating strange meats you find hidden in crevices, or even just laying on the ground! Fearsome barbarians eat whatever they want!Battle wizards and their beastly minions! Punch rocks until they turn into diamonds! Hack away at vicious armored soldiers intent on slaying you and taking away your totally sweet loincloth! Discover wondrous and deadly ancient mechanisms! Tame ferocious beasts! Flex your guns and pecs indiscriminately! Dangle from chains 1-handed like a true badass! Handle explosives with little to no care whatsoever! Dodge snake-based traps, the most fiendish kind of traps known to man! Experience love, lust, and loss! Followed by triumph! Possibly followed by even more lust, the most important emotion!All this excitement (And more! So much more!...eventually!) is packed into an experience just under 2 hours long, with 3 more adventures (episodes) to follow once they're finished and released by the developer. All future episodes will be available to you for free by buying this game (Episode 1), with the second coming very soon as of the time of this review (and I use the term ""review"" loosely!).If you can't wait that long because you're an impatient prick or have Restless Gamer-Finger Syndrome, this game includes an endless Horde Mode that strands you atop of a pyramid and pits you against an endless army of goblins, skeleton archers, and trolls! (Or possibly very large hairy barbarians, I can't tell, but they bleed all the same!) You might rage at the constant potshots the archers take, I find myself losing most of my health to them, but YMMV.Enemy variety is alright, we'll probably see different enemies in the upcoming episodes. I'm more annoyed that there aren't that many enemies hanging out in the main game's levels. However, the ones that are there are strategically placed for a challenge, and Horde Mode has all the mobbing you could want.Enough combat moves are available to keep you alive, but face it, all you really need is that badass Elbow Drop! Snake getting grabby? Elbow Drop! Need to deflect a barrage of arrows? Elbow Drop! Vulture trying to eat you? ELBOW DROP IT OUT OF THE SKYYYY!!!The other moves are your basic slash attack, a useful 3-hit combo that sends enemies flying, an overhead swing useful for crowd control and deflecting arrows, and a midair spinning attack that multihits (I find it hard to pull off, the timing is weird). Check the Steam Community Discussion page for more info on the attacks. The main game is easy enough to play through with just the basic attack and occasional 3-hit combo, the extra moves are more for Horde Mode survival.What else, what else... oh right, buy this game! The music fits the bill, the levels are well designed so they aren't monotonous, secrets aren't terribly hard to find thanks to the level design ""hinting"" at them, boss fights are entertaining, there are nekkid ladies, and that's about it. It's a simple and fun game that I'm sure is far from simple and fun to make, so throw your money at the developer so he can crank out those other Episodes."

To me it felt more like a hybrid of 8 and 16bit, as opposed to just an NES title, as many suggest. Really tight and fluid controls - I never died and screamed at my controller. Kickass music, some humorous scenes. Has Wallchicken. Has Epic boss battles.Honestly I wasn't impressed at first but it just got better and better. This episode took me about two hours, but I enjoyed it enough to want to go through again and see if I can raise in the leaderboards, maybe even do some Horde Mode. Even at 2 hours, with 3 more episodes it will hopefully add a good amount of time, and I'm actually hyped to wait for another.If you're an Oldschool Gamer, this is not a let-down."

I imagine the sorcerers who appear later in the game are a tip of the helmet to Tar'hai wizards from the ""Airtight Garage"".The game is brutal, punishing and at the same time fun and exhilerating.  It's perfectly designed levels, tons of playback such as finding all the diamonds, and has the control it demands.  Only two levels as I write this - found another incredible Golden Axe tribute part way through, a hidden area.This game is SOOOO worth the money and I hope they make more levels, but well worth it for one, certainly two.

Like trying to juggle enemys and then you get hurt because you touched them etc.Just a lot of moments where it feels you got nailed and you didn't really see what you did wrong this time compared to the time before where you didn't.If you exit mid chapter and then continue checkpoints are not the same as the ones you start from after dying. There's less of them.Which seems really pointless? Is that a challenge feature?

Replay value isnt really big here, unless you absolutely love the game. One thing is that this game has 3 additional episodes planned. The first episode obviously, and the 2nd was just added to the game. So I really like that, but some people might be unhappy to learn they aren't all already available. The first episode, is rather short actually, took me about 1.5 hours to actually finish it from the start. Granted, it took me a handfull of angry tries before I actually finished it. Plus I havent even touched Ep.2 yet, i'll save that rage-fest for another date.This game is really hard. What makes it hard? Its all about timing, patience and knowledge.

There are also boss battles typical to the genre and hidden gems to pick up for the Steam achievement. Tiny Barbarian isn't hardcore platformer in a meatboy or Spelunky kind of way and requires only little practising being a nice title for casual gamers too! It only takes about an hour to beat the first episode (if you're familiar with older platformers and their quirks) but you will receive the rest of the upcoming episodes for the same price.

Boss encounters are varied and well-crafted, with an encounter with the Serpent Lord in a room full of moving platforms being the high point of the game so far.Only one out of four episodes has been released so far, and it took me about an hour to beat the first time.

I don't think I've ever played a game with worse optimized gamepad controls, if you do decide to play do yourself a favor and stick to the keyboard. I did eventually switch to keyboard and I was immediately happier.Pretty much the only thing about Tiny Barbarian that impressed me was the variety in the level design.

I bought it once for myself and then again for my brother who shared the same love of snes and nes games.  It fits right into that kind of collection.  It's difficult and forgiving at the same time.

There is a good variety of enemies, mechanics and methods to take them down.  I absolutely loved this game and think more developers should try and hone their games to the level this one was.Oh one last thing, this game doesn't have a tutorial but it teaches through example.  To cite one example, there is a platform with a guy on it below you.  You jump and elbow drop the guy to kill him and break the block under him, discovering that blocks can be broken.  This kind of learning is missing from many games these days and replaced with tutorials.  I was very impressed with how natural it all felt and the level of exemplary game design."

,Recommended,253350,8242385,"Posted: 23 December, 2013",all,RykerrK,"It’s been a pretty solid year for side scrollers on the PC front this year so far; we’ve seen Dust, Ducktales HD, D&D Chronicles, Volgarr… it’s just been a good year!  And yet in comes Tiny Barbarian DX like it ain’t no thing.  While I can’t promise you will like Tiny Barbarian DX more than the other games that’ve come out this year, I can tell you I had a blast, and continue to have a blast.  This is the good news.The bad news is it’s not finished.  Not yet.  You can buy this on Steam for ten dollars, but a lot of people will get miffed when they “finish” the game in a bit over an hour for their first run-through and say “That’s it?” because at current count, the game is missing three more chapters.  If you want the rest of the game, you have to wait.  It’s being released on a “when it’s done” basis.  Updates will be pushed out through Steam when available (and the main man has already published a patch that fixed an issue with leader boards), but until then, you’re stuck with what you’ve got, which includes an hour-ish long Episode 1 and an Endless Horde minigame.With that out of the way, let’s take a look at the game itself.  The graphics are simplistic and stylized; too many colors to be a Nintendo game, but it’s definitely got a retro feel to it.  It runs at about sixty frames per second, and animation is fluid. The textures used for bricks tend to get old pretty fast (whereas, for instance, I didn’t really get that feeling when I was playing Fez), but enemy and character presentation is definitely solid.  Background details range from okay to “Oh, there were background details?”  You’ll find often you’re too busy focusing on the action to pay attention to the little stuff.Which is pretty telling about the game.  The controls are a snap, and responsive.  I was able to play with both keyboard and 360 Wireless game pad flawlessly.  One button jumps, the other attacks.  Holding up near a ledge will boost you up.  You stop pressing a direction, he stops moving.  Once you learn how your attack combos manipulate your movement speed when jumping, you’ll know when to stop and when to go… when to press an attack and when to hang back a second and wait for another time frame.  That’s good, because this game can get somewhat demanding as far as game mechanic mastery is concerned.  Timing on spell returns is fairly precise, and progressing through waves of enemies means you need to be paying attention with both hands on the controller unless you want to faceplant into the spikes below.  Luckily, even this isn’t an instant death.  The game is very forgiving, and has many checkpoints in each stage, and dying resets your health to full.  There are no lives; you play until you win, or quit.  I’ve done both.You play as the titular Tiny Barbarian, and you progress through five stages, defeating enemies and boss encounters in order to beat up a mage, save a girl and escape her prison.  No writing awards here; just tried-and-tired damsel-in-distress male power fantasy sexist piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥patch job.  As this game borrows heavily from themes presented by the likes of Conan the Barbarian and Korgoth, I wouldn’t have it any other way.  It’s supposed to be a romp through better times where you didn’t need a “why”, you just needed a direction (right) and a weapon to kill things with.  It works just fine.  Sometimes I did find combos not executing as planned (two short swings followed by a short swing instead of the three-hit combo) but I just chalked that up to personal fail.  It didn’t happen often enough to care.The music, as I have masturbated over in the past frequently, is fantastic.  I think I like it better out of context, but there are a few spots in the game where it matches up very well with the action.  Jeff Ball did very good work here.  Can’t wait to hear what the next chapters sound like, assuming he stays on board for them.  My ONLY complaint with the soundtrack is a half-compliment; this game has a theme which can be heard in several tracks.  It adds a continuity rarely ever heard in games these days, but at the same time it can become grating during your eighteenth death in the same stage.  The songs that depart from the thematic progression tend to stand out more impressively in the end.So I guess whether you buy this game is a matter of taste.  Clocking in at about an hour, this game can be speed-run at under thirty minutes.  That would take several playthroughs, but it’s possible.  Most of the play time in this game comes from the achievements, and leader board progression, which if you’re playing this game offline won’t matter very much at all.  Is an hour something you would pay ten dollars for?When I compare it to my Turtles in Time purchase back in the day ($60 for 25 minutes), it doesn’t seem bad at all.  The achievements are compelling, the game is challenging and was clearly designed with multiple playthroughs in mind, as there are plenty of hidden items and stashes you won’t find all of even on your third run-through.  At the end of the game, you are scored based on completion time, deaths and hidden gems found, so for once the scores in a game *aren’t* completely arbitrary if you enjoy seeing your name up on the leader board.It’s an hour game, with at least three chapters being worked on in the future.  And it’s fun.  And the music is great.  I have no problems recommending this to someone who still enjoys some Nintendo time and doesn’t mind a challenge.  Tiny Barbarian DX is worthy, and it’s incomplete.This is very good, when you think about it."

,Recommended,253350,7950537,"Posted: 7 December, 2013",all,Skeletroy,"originally posted onthatruled.com:Tiny Barbarian DX is a 2D action-platformer that was recently greenlit on Steam. You control the Conan-esque main character in his quest to…save a princess, I think? Hang on and let me back things up for a minute, this game just finished kicking my♥♥♥♥♥and I need a minute to regroup my thoughts.Tiny Barbarian DX doesn’t mess around. This is a retro style game, and it’s “NES hard”. Many games currently give you a “death count” while playing or upon completion (Angry Vdeo Game Nerd Adventures, Rogue Legacy, and Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe are three fine examples), and I died 35 times in the hour and 15 minutes it took me to get through the first chapter. Some of these deaths can be really frustrating and unfair, but luckily the game has auto-checkpoints every few screens. This isn’t “I Wanna Be the Guy”-tough, but it’s still pretty difficult.When you begin the game, there are no tutorials whatsoever. Unlike a game like “They Bleed Pixels” which has a fairly robust tutorial system, Tiny Barbarian DX throws you to the wolves. You know you can attack and jump, and pressing them in combinations with each other and with the D-pad does stuff, but…I still can’t figure out how I did a jumping spin attack. To be honest, the first time I started playing, I didn’t even know the game had started yet. Before you even get a title screen, you’re thrust into the action. A group of baddies are climbing up a mountain, all the while the camera is scrolling up to show you standing at its peak.PROTIP: This is where you start taking control.You’re now in a king of the hill type showdown, facing off against a never-ending horde of increasingly difficult opponents. After you’re eventually defeated (or if you just jump off the mountain), the game will begin proper. You have a choice between “Adventure Mode” (the main game), or “vs. the Horde” (essentially the same as the intro). Going into Adventure Mode you’ll notice that there are 4 chapters, although only the first one, “The Serpent Lord”, is available to play. The other three are not attained by unlocking them. They are still currently being worked on, and will be free upon completion for anyone who already bought the game.The music is chiptune-tastic. When you get frustrated by all the constant death, the music is there to keep you pumped and ready for action. A good example of this is my favorite track, “Rebirth”, which plays while you’re ascending a tower in a rudimentary elevator. I probably died in this section more than any other (the Serpent Lord battle being a close second), and it wasn’t so I could keep listening to the music. The soundtrack is available on Bandcamp, and is definitely worth a listen.If you want a fun, challenging game that’s low on story to the point of forgettable, high on action, and makes you feel like a badass for being able to get through it, check out Tiny Barbarian DX. And when you have gotten through it, just know that there are 3 more chapters to challenge you at some point in the future."

Died so many times but honestly, if you play the game without dying, you werent challenged. This game really make you feel like a badass barbarian. Can't wait for the future releases. Congrats guys on making a good game, this game is on my top 5."

I'd read great things about it and so on. Well, then I decided to buy it and man how I love it!Like many good platformers, it's all about a great level design and controls and Tiny Barbarian DX won't disappoint you on that front. It's tough, but fair. Challenging, but never in a way, that you can't figure it out and execute your tactics perfectly. The levels have variety AND it has great boss battles also.The graphics and soundtrack are also top notch, some tracks being so good I noticed my feet tapping against the floor. :)If there's some critique, it would be the grabbing system, BUT fortunately you can put it to automatic via options. And I really recommend it. Don't worry: It won't make the game easy, it just corrects one thing, that's a flaw in this game (IMO).Some people are criticizing about the lenght of the game, which I kind of understand, IF you jumped on the wagon, when there was only the 1st episode out (now there are two already), as it is the easier of the 2 episodes out so far (but don't be fooled, it's not _easy_ ). Is it worth the money then? ABSOLUTELY. The two episodes already have a hefty amount of playtime (4-5h) and there are still two episodes to be released, which probably raise the playtime to roughly 10 hours. And like I always say: quality over quantity, and in this case it really once again is true.Oh, and I really recommend gamepad or arcade stick for this one."

,Recommended,253350,16551971,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,Snickerabbit?,"Alright then...Right off the bat, you may believe that this game is just another pixel art indie game with no sense of style or substance. Well unfortunately, after spending about 2 hours playing this game, I can safely say that this game is 100% accurate to the barbarian lifestyle and a DAMN fine Run-And-Slash platformer.The overall presentation is immediately charming, with the first chapter starting off with a well implemented homage to Conan. From there, the game plays like a combination of golden axe and a low-fi rayman origins. You run, jump, attack, climb ledges (by the way, go into options, into config, turn on ""AUTO GRAB"" and thank me later), ride huge cats, get killed by rolling snakes. Y'know, the basics of any barbarian lifestyle.The game itself can be described as taking inspiration from classic arcade games like the aformentioned golden axe whilst implementing its own unique style to make it interesting. However, this game can be rather unwieldly at times, with one poor jump sending into instant death (VERY common in chapter 2), or setting you so far back in progression that you'd might as well kill yourself to start the screen again.The main aspects of this game that hooked me were the cute graphics, superb music and the simplicity of the controls when they weren't freaking out and getting me killed by gorillas and snake wizards.If I were forced to grade this game, I'd give it a 6.5/10. Nothing groundbreaking and the controls freak a little occasionally, but it succeeds in producing a satisfying experience with charming visuals and decent challenge that won't deter Noobs and Vets alike.P.S. The Manual (Check the library page) comes with a comic and an enemy and control breakdown. Nostalgia achieved."

,Recommended,253350,10703316,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,Jezziah,"This is a good mix of challenging gameplay, classic platforming, well-scripted boss fights, and stands as a loving homage to the Barbaric bash-'em-ups of old. Only now as I type this has the second episode been released - it's been worth the wait, as I'm enjoying it so far and it flows on nicely from the challenges of the first. Some good humour mixed with fun chiptune-style music and pixellated graphics that actually look the part - nothing seems messy or out of place from a game that could have barely scraped through on a Master System. Controls are quite tight, though you might feel a bit cheated when Tiny doesn't grab a ledge while he's right next to it. Recommended if you like a decent challenge and cracking good value!"

Beautiful, charming Pixelgraphics but unlike others it doesn`t just look oldshool it plays that way. It gets pretty hard fast but stays fair, it has no tutorials you learn the simple although deep mechanics just trough playing, with the Bombboss for example...Can't wait to finish this and then for the other Episodes."

No fancy story lines, no elaborate cut scenes, just you, your sword, and your loincloth trying to save a nameless blond girl from treacherous villains like snakes and monkeys.Pros:-tight controls, necessary in a game like this, and never once did I miss a jump and blame it on the controls-nice progression of difficulty, episode 1 was pretty easy, episode 2 got gradually harder and harder but not to the point of frustration.-great set pieces, while the overall platforming is solid, fun and varied, you will be going through levels and all of a sudden something awesome happens, I don't want to give spoilers but there are plenty of moments that will make you want to run outside in a loin cloth and flex for passing cars.-great old school graphics, while this game probably could have been done on NES, I like this style of graphics and if you are reading this review odds are you do too.- 2 episodes are currently available with 2 more on the way, these episodes are free if you own this game so no extra fees for their releaseCons:-arbritary savepoints are way too far apart.  Every time you reach a new screen that is a checkpoint, and if you die you will restart from that screen with full health.  These checkpoints are liberally scattered throughout the game so you will never have to replay long sections trying to get back to the point you died.  That is a pro, the con is that these checkpoints are not save points, and you will have to play for some time to reach an actual save point(usually about 20-35 minutes).  Not a huge con by any means, but if you are pressed for time like I am it may annoy you slightly, and given the extremely liberal checkpoints I don't see why there is not a save anywhere feature.This is a fantastic old school game, and I cannot wait for episodes 3 and 4 to be released, definitely a game you need to play."

I spent an hour to finish that and then went through it again with my much younger brother. So to then find over a year later that there was going to be a much larger game got me very excited. Well that was when the game came out and I can't lie, I haven't really played it since then. You see, back then when I baught this game I also started working full time and so the alure of AAA games at the time seemed better than a little indie game. But, I missed games with good pixel art, and saw this in my library, so here I am!I've gone ahead and finsihed the first episode, which is great btw. It had me frustrated many times, mostly due to some of the hitboxs and timing of hits being a bit off. For example hitting a projectile had me attacking a bit in advanced rather than when is was at me, the former also resulting in a loss of health :(  Due to this and other annoying factors the last boss fight was a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Seriously though, I don't want to spoil it for you guys, but the game is hard enough as it is with out bad boss design. Okay, okay, not bad, but it could be better. However when you do beat that boss as well as the other hurdels the game throws at you, you get a certain level of accomplishment that more than makes up for the bad.Its always so easy to mention the bad though, so I'd like to touch on the good too. Music, the chip tune music is great, catchy and changes when it starts to get repetitive. Pixel art, supurb! I'm actually a pixel artist myself so I can really appreciate how long it must takes to make something like this, spicifically with all the limitations this guys put on himself. And overall gameplay is also good, even the mount felt good to use, even though I found the sliding a tad annoying, I know why its there, but still annoyying.Overall a good game, I look forward to episode 2! Which I'll get to once I recover from the last episode."

It took me just over 6 hours to get through the two chapters that are currently available, but maybe I'm just awful (a highly likely possibility). It should be noted that there are only two chapters currently in the game, but more are coming, and what is there is well worth the asking price."
,Recommended,253350,29301088,Posted: 16 January,all,tearfromthered,"This game has a smart old school nostalgic design that manages to revive the golden axe genre in an awesome way. The fighting part of it is pure fun and glory, while the platforming sections  are  pixel perfect sort of challenges. There are very little save points so be ready to get at it for a good session of 30 min at least if you want you checkpoint to be saved on next boot. Variety, cute design and smart level design makes this game a must try in a period where those kind of homages are very numerous and not always up to quality."
