,Recommended,253370,7838126,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,jsmartmon,"EDIT: This is a more updated review than my previous one.I've used AGF for a while now and I have a lot more experience using the tools. I like the accessiblity of this program, as it is quick and easy to make complex landscapes and basic buildings and structures. They have also greatly increased the amount of different terrain textures and objects that you can place into your world. If you want to make anything fantasy medieval, there are plenty of objects and prebuilt buildings for you to use. I have yet to check out the added DLC, but it is still a great tool regardless. Personally, I only use the tool to make the terrain and put in buildings, then I just export it to Unity 3D and it usually works ok. The only problem can be when they update the program, you have to put in the new exporter tools into a new Unity project. Other than that, it is a great tool for both beginners and the more experienced."

This program was made in a way you have to buy the Premium version. Let me explain:-You can't buy the premium. You have to buy the normal version first and then the premium, that's not even the worst.-> in the basic version there is nearly nothing you can do with exception of walking around on your terrain which took you a few minutes to build because you only have 10% resources from the Premium version to build a terrain because you didn't buy the Premium add on.Without the Premium version I wouldn't recommend it to you. If you want to buy the Premium add on anway, go ahead.-Thumbs down -> 20Euro for only 10% recources you can use.Basic (10%) Premium(90%)No hate, just facts.-Pat"

This is purely design; there are plenty of engines out there that give you access to both.Bought this back during its release week years ago and was very much mislead to what its actual functionality was (for all intents and purposes, it was advertised as something we could actually make games with.. not just levels for games). I haven't clicked on my Software tab in literal ages (2-3 years at least) and when I saw this app I immediately threw up in my mouth because I remember the nearly 200 damn dollars I wasted.

I fully understand that sometimes, we get the item or object we ordered and it isnt exactly what we expected. Sometimes it is a bug, glitch, or malfunction within the shipping. And I get this. But what I was blown away with from the provided performance WITHIN the software itself, was very rough and not a great experience.My problems started right off the bat. In the game launcher, when you were suppose to select New Project, etc. the game-provided clicker was not corresponding correctly with your mouse's clicker. I had to put my mouse roughly an inch below the button to be able to click it.Thinking this was a launcher induced problem, I decided to ignore it. After opening the application and getting into the full window with the settings, depth, brushes, etc. I continued to have more problems.- The ""Fullscreen"" window, is not fullscreen. It is a window that does take up the FULL SCREEN, but can be clicked and dragged around your display. This was very hard to deal with when attempting to place the clicker (that as I said before, had to be put in a certain area to be able to click the given button) and accidentally grabbing the window itself.- With the mouse clicker issue, I was not able to use the remaining two buttons on the bottom of the left side bar, because my real mouse (where I had to place it) was technically off of this ""Fullscreen"" window, so it wouldnt function with the game. Quite hard to explain, but I hope you get the point.- The game seems to have a bit of drag, especially after placing down a certain tile of land or water, as it begins to slide in random direction as you attempt to guide the landpiece the opposite way.- Several buttons within the side bars seemed to be unfunctional, even after being clicked by the real game clicker, so land was much more difficult to create.Coming to believe there would have been many more bugs as I came around to playing, I unfortunately had only been interactive with the software for five minutes before deciding to quit using it as a whole.I hope this review was a good guide to those who are thinking about purchasing the software. It really is your choice, because my product might have been especially bugged compared to others. As an analogy I used in the beginning of the review, it is like shipping. Once it comes to your door, it could have been hurt in the factory process, shipping process, or even handling process. So you never really know how the software performs for you as an individual, until you try it.Thank you for reading the review."

The click and camera moving towards the mouse click thing has to go , it does not work well on any level of sculpting (for object placement if should be optional2. Moving around the environment , please mimic unity's style everyone who wishes to use this software should get used to it3. Objects placement , when placing castle objects you are not able to zoom back to the ground without goign into prefab design mode then going back to design mode,4. Terrain sculpting, a limit to how high your current brush can sculpt would be nice , making a slightly elevated flat section is not as easy  (I might not have found the tool yet)5 And this is probably where this software could pull the golden win , the ability to create prefabs from content packs fantacy / sci fi / vehicle , I like the idea of being able to create a building and then port it in various stages to my unity game.For instance if i am able to build a level 1 building design it texture it and send it through to unity then go on to the second level for that specific building , or build diferent kinds of spaceships with powerfull texturing options like Spore for exampleFrom the kickstarter campaign to the actual delivered product this is quite the let down in terms of what the vision was for this softwareThis is not a Game Factory (yet) but an advanced terrain prototyping tool prior to loading your project into unity and making it an actual game (using actual code, AI development) which i dont mind.I know its easy to critisize and for the price measured against other unity assets i can certainly not complainI am sure in the future we might see even greater things from this kit and taking all things into consideration I would recommend this kit for its terrain layout abilities and for what it might become"

On top of that in the prefab area if you make your own designs you can save them out as perfabs to use in your levels.This saves lots of time having to build the same thing from scratch, best part of the program by far, is you can pass on your levels to others and then they have the same prefab that can be used in there own levels.The terrain editing is wonderfully easy and very easy to inport into unity, and they look wonderful.Using AGF in tandum with Unity is great for building your own assets as you can add scripts to the assets to make animations for your presets I.E an opening chest ( I belive the windmill from the assets pack was done in Unity this way ) you can also add sound to the sets as well.for the people that cant afford Unity pro, and even though this is not a stand alone game maker you can swap levels with your friends and play the levels from in side AGF, there is some basic enemys atm but from what the devs have said there is a lot more to come.Dev support is one of the best I have seen, not only was they willing to answer all my questions, they even came on chat with me to help sort out a problem I had exporting from Unity (You big company's should take leaf out of these dev's book ).They did tell me there is a lot more comming soon although they did not divulge what any of it was.Anyway big thanks to Flint and Matt for the extensive help they provided, was way beyound any thing I expected."

Hold the right mouse button for one set of command and then press and hold the spacebar while holding the right mouse button for the other set of commands.

You can read my review of that here:Zombie FPSOk so now back to AGF itself. LikeANYgame making engine you will have to learn what and where everything is..i.e. the UI, buttons, dock, warehouse....ect. but once you learn that, things are very easy to do from what I have used of it so far. There are a good amount of ""assets"" to use to make your levels for what came with it. I do hope that the devs will add more assets/content to it, but perhaps you can do that with Unity assets, I haven't gotten that far yet, I am still stuck in Zombie-land right now.AGF is a GREAT place to start if you have never made a game before, it will get you used to how things work in MOST game making engines and from what I have done in the FPS Zombie part of the game making, you make your level/s get it the way you like it and once you are ready you can have a ""Game"" made and have friend's play it on their computers. No models to make, no scripting, just place and play type of thing...for me that is a GREAT thing and this is a GREAT tool to do that with!And the devs are updating often, I had a small problem and that was one of the things they put in the update (a couple of days later)...so they are around and they are listening ;)I hope some/all of you will look into purchasing AGF and enjoy using it as much as I am right now...HAVE FUN MAKING STUFF!!~mP.S. If you would like, you can play my very first zombie game made with AGF Zombie FPS here:My Zombie Game"

I think the concept is great and the world editior was a designed to match the greatness of the concept. Very easy to use and learn. My 8 year old son and I breezed through the manaual for the world editior. The problem was the question he asked me the moment we finished ""what now dad?"" I wasnt sure either.It seems like much of the support for this software was designed for people who are familiar with its history. I only started using it with the V2 release and I don't really know where to go next. I keep seeing this Unity 3d software come up throughout all of the documents so it seems like you need to get it to fully enjoy the features of the software (they do have a limited free version...who wants that).  I was hoping the creation of a game would be as easy as the editior was but no such luck. I am now trying to trade my software off sisnce both my son and I are now frustrated and uninterested  anymore.  They do offer personal direct support so that is pretty cool. It just seems like they are not ready for new people to get in on this. Much of what they support is people who have been with them for a while.

I have used FPS Creator ( old and Reloaded version), RealmCrafter,   Dark Basic, Stencyl and many others. By far this is the best game maker I have ever used. It has plenty of features that are easy to use. Unlike the other game makers, this one lets you import assets easy. Gives you a ""construct"" mode to make and combine other assets to form a new one. Can also paint your assets. So no need for Blender or 3d max except maybe for rigging. Sketch Up compliments this very well if you are wanting to make custom assets. No need for heavy code knowledge or experience either, simple drag and drop. Far less coding involved then any of the formentioned. (Yes even FPSC) They are up front with what you are getting. And support is wonderful.  Now forTHEcon, the asset shop is lacking items really. It would be nice to see them open the shop in a way that the communitycoulds sell custom made assets. Kinda like a big flee market for the ones of us who are lazy like me. :)From their site and they do mean this:""If you have given AGF a bad review on Steam please contact us.

I highly recomend this software to anybody interest in learning to build their own world  and start making games come to life. I would also like to metion that the customer service is a 110%.

People complaining that it is only an level and map creation tool are missing out the fact that that is exactl;y what it is described as, it is not misleading at all.It's called Game Factory because that is what it will eventually become with enough content, it has plenty of features already and the developers are open to new ideas so I odn't see how anyone could be complaining, all you need is ""Axis Game Factory's AGFPRO 3.0"" and the Zombies DLC and you can create your own levels but Premium has way more functionality, to complain and say's it's not a game maker is either because you have not assimilated it enough, not imaginative enough or you've only got the basic version, for a really affordable price.I have had a good few hours testing it and I have no issues with creating a game, in fact, I can't believe how easy it is to use once you get the hang of some major functions, I am also very impressed by how fast the software allows me to create whole areas or scenes for my levels. You don't actually level up but you can add more powerful weapons as you enter new levels, not unlike other games so I don't get how people can bring this awesome software down.IMHO, you can't beat it for the price but I would also recommend you download one of the DLC's to give yourself a few more fun additions. - Yes, there were some bugs that made the game maker not a game maker but they have been fixed now -If you run into issues and want to see new features you get to speak to the developers and have your say, all contact is built into the software and updates are regular - I have found a glitch or 2 but that has not stopped me from being creative enough to work around it, the software allows you to do just that, even in the basic version.
