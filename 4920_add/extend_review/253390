,Not Recommended,253390,33376543,Posted: 8 July,all,Sweet Indigo,"A game with a great sense of humour that is unfortunately let down by it's maze-like platforming and lack of a map. I never once felt like I knew where I was going and quickly grew frustrated at having to change the bullets one-by-one. There's a rapid reload ability, so why is there no rapid ammo-swap ability? Such a simple feature would have made the game far more bearable."
,Not Recommended,253390,14588143,"Posted: 21 February, 2015",all,A Wild Pokemon,"UPDATE: Literally within hours of posting this they put out two updates/patches, one of which fixed the original bug that prevented progress after a certain point. While the other points still stand, they've  fixed the issue (at least for me) on saves that kill completion of the game. However, at this price point, I'd still wait at least for sale to get at least your money's worth for the first few hours.First off - in terms of style, humor, and mood this game delivers exactly what you're looking for. It's witty, tongue-in-cheek, and one of those games where I could be posting screenshots all day.In many ways, it feels as if the developers and creators spent a lot of love and time starting the game and creating the idea, but eventually lost interest or ran into production issues because the game starts strong but quickly devolves into frustrating platforming puzzles and a punishing gauntlet of bugs.In early levels and stages, you're rewarded for your exploration with secret areas, collectibles, and so on. But later on, you run the risk of finding a collectible or jumping through an invisible wall which will render you unable to escape and forcing you to use the last savepoint to resume your progress. It got to a point where it felt like a rogue-like of chancing whether or not I would bug out or find a collectable.The save checkpoints are cute and humorously executed, because as many times as you do it it never quite gets old - however the sloppiness in code execution, combined with long distances between savepoints ultimately has led to a point where I can resume yet find myself in a place unable to complete the game, essentially remembering my location in a map yet resetting all the doors, trapping me inside.I really REALLY wanted to love this game - and in many ways I still do - but unfortunately because of the large number of bugs and sloppy techncial execution towards the end I can't recommend it in the state it's in. Rule one should be - you must be able to finish the game."

And you may find things you couldn't before coming back to areas with new bullet types.But be warned, if you don't like reading flavor text and prefer voice acting skiping over text, you will not get as much out of the game since it is all text which gives the game part of its fun, much like how a big part of CRPGs isn't the RPG part but the conversation trees part which is also very often text only without VO since there are a lot of tree options. And like CRPGs if you just do the main required dialog the game can be relitivly short but if you do all the dialog you can, it has a lot of good content there that takes more time."
,Recommended,253390,21970925,"Posted: 21 March, 2016",all,Sutorei,"Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora is all about the fusion of seemingly incompatible elements into something unique.What do you expect from a game, when the first thing you see are detectives in fedoras and trench coats, working inside a dimly lit police station with wooden furniture and red carpets everywhere? Maybe some gritty story about a rotten-to-the-core megalopolis, full of injustice and corruption, ruled by undefeatable criminal masterminds?However, it cannot be so grim, one would think, when the protagonist detective is a boxy woman, her partner is a boxy cat, and they jump and wobble as they move. Moreover, their whole world is like that too - boxy and jumpy. This visual style is lively and memorable, if limited, but one would think: can it convey something beyond a wacky-zany-surreal adventure?And then the heroes get an urgent request to investigate a recent burglary, and, shortly after, a homicide case. The plot only goes grimmer from there, holding faithfully to the noir canon. It does not get bleak and depressing, thanks to the carefully mixed light-hearted humor in the dialogues and interactions, that manages to ease the mood, without turning everything into an outright comedy. Also, the city and the characters you meet are not doomed to the worst: there's a big freedom of choice, and you can help citizens via side quests - almost all of your actions will be acknowledged in the game ending.The soundtrack helps game atmosphere greatly. When you play something noir, blues music with a juicy sax is necessary. In Hot Tin Roof that sax is accompanied by 8bit-ish synths - they fit in the ensemble as naturally as a xylophone or a rhodes piano would. The overall sound is chill and relaxing, and, with all the intricate sax solos, it stays in the background, as a good soundtrack should.That chillout mood is perfect for the gameplay - there's nobody to fight and kill, with aimlessly wandering green blobs in underground areas coming as close as this game gets to enemies. Your trusty Wobbly revolver is for overcoming obstacles and exploring the game world, which has its fair share of secrets. You collect new types of ammo as you advance in the game, and in a good Metroidvania fashion, you can always revisit previously locked out areas and use your new toys to find something desperately needed or just helpful and interesting.And remember -you don't have to reload your revolver chamber by chamber, hold R to instantly reload your current configuration!While this tip is present in the game, I wish it came by earlier.The game world is, again, a fusion of 2D and 3D. For the most part, you navigate it as a 2D platformer, but you can switch planes and make turns at some points. This actually simplifies the comprehension of the locations, as instead of sudden and not always explainable screen switches, you have obvious connections between streets, passages, and shafts. Another important tip: if you stand on the edge of the platform and can't see what's down there, most of the time there's nothing and you'll fall back to the ground level if you jump there.This experiment with mixing and fusing gameplay mechanics and styles results in a one-of-a-kind game, and it's well worth its price. As of today, Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora has roughly 7k owners according to Steamspy, and this rare gem deserves much more recognition.P.S.

The noir genre relies on good story-telling and it just seemed to be lacking in this game, but I guess that's due to the strong emphasis on the platformer puzzles, so take it with a grain of salt.Also, there are times when you can purchase items in the game. However, I found that it was very easy to mine for money early on, and once I bought most of everything that was available, money became useless.It would've been really nifty if I had been able to bribe characters for clues or tips to progress a case or complete a side quest.If there is a sequel for Hot Tin Roof (and I do hope there are plans for it because it was delightful!), I hope that Emma's cat partner, Franky, can do more than just act as a guide; I felt that at times she wasn't too helpful and she did get in the way when I fired the revolver, but she was good company.Overall, I enjoyed the game and there is replayability value since there are various side quests to seek out and there are (from what I've read) around fifteen different endings.If you like noir, cats, and puzzles that are more complex than what you'd find in Mario - I'd say it's worth a try!"

I'd watched 'Nerd3 plays...' of it and the clever dialouge drew me in. The art style is  fresh though at times I feel its a bit too sharp around the edges and needed more polish. I do feel the people who made it had their hearts in the right places and wanted to make a good homage to the noir genre.Disclaimer: I'm not good at platformers and this game turned out to be one. I wasn't aware of this when I bought it. I thought it'd be a P.I. puzzle solving, collecting evidence kinda game. On closer inspection '3D Platformer' is in the description as a bulletpoint and as a tag however the screenshots and trailer don't show this. It was too late for me to refund though.I haven't finished the game so I can't comment on the story. Look to other reviews for that.Pros: Clever/funny dialouge, lives and breathes the noir genre, cute rats that are not automatically bad guys (just a personal one).Cons: The platforming! Clunky controls, very difficult puzzles in the factory level that require more precision than the game allows (I'm stuck here). The gun bullets at first seem an interesting way of doing things but the slow reloading of them becomes labourious quickly and its difficult to tell which bullet you'll be firing first.Conclusion: I really wanted to like this game for its great character however I felt like I was constantly fighting it as I progressed due to stubborness rather than enjoyment. The factory level was the last straw for me. Some tightening of the controls and maybe more visual hints would go a long way."
,Recommended,253390,18442662,"Posted: 12 October, 2015",all,mckerrnel13,"I enjoy quirky games that have a sense of humour and aren't overly-complicated.  And I enjoy mysteries.  I enjoyed these aspects of the game, and I do recommend it, but there are some caveats.The concept of the different ammunition in the game is a great one, and makes the game simple, provides many possibilities for problem solving, and is kinda cool.  But the way it was implemented drove me bonkers.  When in a room and needing to use different ammunitions, sometimes the puzzle would require three or four of a particular type, then you would have to switch out to a different one (or two), do something with them, and then switch back.  Granted, I'm sure in hindsight that I could have streamlined that and analyzed the problem and come up with a more efficient ammunition usage, but who wants to do that?  Swapping out the ammunition is such an annoying mechanic, it would be much easier to put in some sort of ammo configuration and swap to it with a button or hotkey.Still on the ammunition, some of the proximity/mapping of where you are in relation to the target object is sometimes not very precise.  Trying to light something on fire sometimes takes three or four tries...needlessly frustrating.If you watched my let's play of this series, I get quite angry with the controller response -- PLEASE do not take that as a negative on this game.  That was a problem with my PC that was registering a button press multiple times and just causing no end of frustration for me.  I finally figured it out, so the controller response was fine in the game, my only beef is with the mechanic behind the way you reloaded and chose ammunition for the gun.  There were a few spots where precision is required and I'll chalk my difficulties there to poor hand coordination and not knock the game on it.With the exception of one puzzle, which turned out to be a side-quest, and not necessary to complete the main story line, the puzzles vary from easy to hard, but not too hard.  I think I relied on hints two or three times through the series, one of which was for the impossible-to-solve-so-I-didn't-side-quest, and in hindsight if I'd used common sense and had more patience I would have eventually solved them on my own.  There were a few ""tasks"" which I'll group into the puzzle category, that made you revisit the maze of levels in parts of the game I'd much prefered to not have to go back down into the bowels for, but it wasn't too onerus, just time consuming...would change that in a future game.I don't mean this in a negative way...the game was simple, and has a simple design.  That is part of its charm...there aren't all these different button combos, and it is a unique story and setting.  Aside from some of the criticisms above, I did enjoy this game.  If you lack patience, or are prone to give up on stuff if you get mildly frustrated, then this probably isn't the game for you.  But if you give it a chance, especially if you like cats (I don't, ironically), then I think you will get a lot of enjoyment from this game.It's a simple, quirky, funny mystery with cats and guns."

It is hard to climb and is more platformer than I hoped for. When I got this game, I had no idea it was a platformer. It is really easy to fall through the floor and end up all the way at the bottom. It's terrible because there is no frequent saving!!  I really want to advance but I keep getting stuck in the same place over and over again. The reloading is hard especially since a lot of the time, you need to use multiple bullets.Another thing, I got lost so much because there is no map and the game is so complex. There is so many ways to get anywhere and if you missed anything at all, you will get nowhere.  Very frustrating.I really love this game but it's too hard."

I love cats. I love lesbians. I love funny dialog. The creators have made a wonderful little world here that incorporates all of those things, unfortunately the game itself is a platformer. The kind of platformer that forces you to fall down the same hole and repeat the same room over and over and over till you get the timing perfect, and then when you finally get past, something kills you and sends you back to a checkpoint three rooms ago. There is so much promise here, but being forced to collect coins and jump around like a Mario brother is absolutely not my cup of tea. Only for die-hard platformer fans."

It hits players who don't mind exploring, and don't mind being patient. This is very much like the old lucas arts days, as you will get lost, and a lot of the mechanics will wear over time. Reloading the gun got extremely annoying, and several of the shots didn't make any sense with camera angles. It's the story that'll drive this one, but it wasn't enough to overlook several of the flaws that wore on me as I played the game.In the end, For story related minded people, it's a game that I'd look at when it's on sale.

The graphics are actually better than the screenshots/video convey - going past an alleyway there's all levels of parallax going on. I didn't see much help on this, so for those that have bothered reading my review, go to the restroom - that's how you save (""parp!""). The order of doing things so far has been quite linear, and you definitely have to ask Franky about clues if that's an option. Not sure if I'm putting inappropriate spoilers or hints in here, but I also recommend watching closely for those little white arrows that tell you if there's another area you can explore (this stumped me very early on). Love the atmosphere, the fact that cats feature very heavily and that it's a female protagonist (but that doesn't make any difference!). Ooh, and another hint for newbies - hold R to reload whatever you put in the barrel last time - saves a lot of clicking, and the game doesn't tell you this until later on. I got this on sale, as I wasn't 100% convinced, but if you like platformers, humourous (but not slapstick) games, a bit of retro and some lateral thinking, it's probably worth a punt."

To start, the game has a lot of platforming and physics puzzles which would normally not be an issue but the controls for moving and aiming make them an absolute chore. There’s no map system to assist you with knowing whether you’ve fully explored areas and the lack of fast travel means you have to walk all the way to each locale at a snail’s pace. The gun reloading and custom bullet system is pretty cool but I kept wishing the gun had more than 4 chambers on many an occasion. Solving multiple bullet type puzzles was a real chore since you have to load the chambers the exact right way to have the necessary bullet ready within a moment’s notice.Sadly even with a seemingly-cozy detective noir aesthetic, Hot Tin Roof fails to land on its feet and becomes yet another forgettable indie title."

It glitches out and hangs constantly - dialogue either blipped by or it hung on people's lines to the point where I had to restart it three times before giving up. On the lowest settings, it should run like a dream. It doesn't."
