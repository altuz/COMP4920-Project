After a few hours of almost nothing but killing goblins, boars and bears I'm giving up.  I have no clue what the point of the story is supposed to be, what the world is, why I should care, and my character is already level 10.  Maybe it gets better later on, but I couldn't bring myself to kill the same dozen infinite-respawning bears again and again to find out."

Ravensword is generic, contains mostly empty non-detailed areas, boring fights and a lot of grinding - feels like a mmo without other players. Hidden extras, secrets and puzzles are non-existent (beside maybe a small cave or two). Exploring the landscape is ultimatively pointless. The music is ok, graphics are ugly. Open-world though you have to grind first to survive the higher-tier areas. Gameplay is absurd - you slay trolls and giants but the tiny crabs completely own you. Story and characters are forgettable. You're some male looking for a sword to slay a demon.Rather buy or play some more Skyrim (or Fallout or Baldur's Gate or Witcher or Isaac or Terraria or or or) and if you hate Skyrim you'll hate this game anyway. Ravensword is a waste of your playing time and money."

It has it's moments of fun and you get to fly cool mounts eventually, but it has a lot of problems.  I still want to play it, but will need to remember to SAVE OFTEN!!!  You die a lot and get stuck in the environments.Graphics are a mess in some places and it really takes away from the atmosphere.  Trees, rocks and plants will be floating in the air, tears in the buildings, popup everywhere, etc.  Some textures just don't seem finished.  Music, sound effects and voice acting are all done well.  There are some cool enemies to fight.  I love the skeletons!  Character models and animations are okay.I give this game a 5/10 because of the cheap price and it can be fun to play!  ONLY purchase if you are the kind of player that is very forgiving of glaring flaws and can still have fun with mediocre games.  This was one of those rare games that I played from start to finish without any breaks!  I liked it!Pros+ Open World, free-roaming exploration+ Unlimited ammo for bows, crossbows and guns+ Has horses and flying mounts+ Decent graphics+ Nice magic effects+ Has quests+ Can keep playing after the main quest is completed+ Has some cool bugs and glitchesCons- Small area maps- One town with minimal shops- Not many hidden areas to find- Not many different weapons & items- Same mounts throughout the game- Floating trees, rocks, plants, etc.- Death animations could be better- Not many magical spells/runes- Small amount of quests- No ending?- Has many bugs and glitches- Game seems unfinished"

Iesabel was another perfect example of this. Games ported from android are shorter, smaller, and simpler, but that doesn't mean that they can't be fun and provide a few hours of enjoyment. I enjoyed this game all the way from the finish. It was far from perfect and had some texture glitches, (nothing game breaking), but the story and soundtrack were good, the combat system simple, the controls spot on, the landscapes beautiful, and the enemy variety interesting. It's basically a budget elderscrolls. Some of the keys can be rebound, but not all of them and that was a big negative for me. Other than that, there's not very much to complain about here for the price."

It is relatively short (5-6 hours), but that at least means you will not have enough time to get bored with the simple gameplay. All in all it is a fun game for spending a few mindless hours after a hard day in work.That being said, there is probably a reason why a lot of people feel being ripped off. I would blame it especially on the features list on the store page - richly detailed world? I would say that about Planescape Torment, not this. Hundreds of items? I don't think I have used more than a hundred during the game. Lockpicking and pick pocketing has practically no use in the game. Decision based, multi-part quests? Again, do not expect any depth here. And the reputation system is in the game just for the sake of there being one.Turn down your expectations and you might actually enjoy the game for what it is."

The game reminds me a lot like Skyrim, and whileit has its quirks it's still a fun game to play. I understand it's a mobile game, but if you didn't play the mobile version, this is still worth a buy in my opinion.

Its worth its price but if you go in expecting a serious rpg your going to be disappointed you may have to do some grinding for money/exp but if you get $4000 crossbow from the northern part of town you should be good to go since range is the most powerful thing in this game so far.

This is a game somewhere between Baldur's gate and Dragon Age.  Keep in mind, those games new on a PC were $40-$50.    The graphics in Ravensword are not cutting edge 21st century, and there aren't hours of audio and video cut scenes.   Having put all that down, for $14 on Steam int's a very fun and utterly playable game with a very large world to explore.  It feels a lot like WoW without the idiots, I mean, other players, LOLS.   I find it funny that guys who are bragging about their gaming rigs being so up to date, and I assume, expensive can be so boorish when reviewing a relative bargain.Also, I find the fight dynamics pretty cool.  You have to carefully time your striking and parying attacks to best defend yourself while dealing out maximum damage to the enemy.  Much more dynamic than games where you just hold down the ""kill"" button and hope the enemy's HP gives out before yours does or turn based RPG's.  It's fun, it's enjoyable, it plays well on modern CPU's with not so modern graphics cards.  I do wish I could propose to a couple of the NPC's too."

Skyrim is better but it's rated M by ESRB so some people may  not be able to play it and it's more expensive... well not really anymore, just buy skyrim when it's on sale if it's otherwise to pricey.Ravensword is a fun game, it;s more creative than Skyrim, but overall a much lower quality game. It takes a bit of grinding here and there, some of the game mechanics are a little glichy and     the story, well the story is half decent but by no means original.So at the end of the day, I f there is a reason you cannot play skyim, whether you can't play M game or you computer is not good enough, then yea I would recomend this game. If you already have played tons of hours on skyrim and just want something a little different, then buy it, the overall gameplay is quite fun, but there is not a lot of content, I have beaten this game 3 times on my computer and once on my iPad 2. I have about 20 hours acording to steam, so that means it took me about 7 hours to beat this game each time. It has a short story and few side quests, once the game is over you can buy a house and join one of I would guess 4 or 5 guilds and then there is darn near nothing to do.To give you and idea of the quality / size of game, my iPad 2 can run it and yes, it is on the app store... Well I am not sure if it's still there but I would not be supprised. I would recomend this game very strongly to someone who is looking for a game of this style for there mobile device.Btw Falcon is op and alows you to skip large parts of areas so you don't have to kill stuff the whole way. It's kinda cool, but also takes away from the game a little.In the end I would recomend this game.6/10I only give 6/10 because the quality is poor, however the gameplay is quite fun."

There's nothing in the environment, and the graphics suck for a computer game. This would be a so-so mobile game; one you buy play it for a bit and then forget it's installed on your phone, until one day you're like ""Oh my, what is this?"" then you're like ""Oh i remember this; Why did I stop playing this? Oh that's right, it's dull. (kinda feels like staring at a wall dull),"" then you go ""why do I have this installed?"" and then delete it and always regret buying it.It's not to bad. Ok story, at least so far. Game play is so-so. Anyway the graphics need improving, and might is suggest adding some voice actors or audible dialogue.I would say the game is a 1/5 if I wanted to be mean, but I'll be fair, SO it gets a 3/5, or 60%, or 6/10, or D-. It's an ok game, but don't except a whole lot out it, or you'll end up eating a jar of ice cream, curling up in the fetal position and crying yourself to sleep, for a couple of days.Once again I say it's a 3/5.Have a nice day."

Especially for the time it was made and even more so now. It's very slow with the animations and the machanics and the voice acting is very limited. In those regards, it becomes kind of boring. So, why do I recomend it? Becasue it's actually a good game with a good story. True, it's very slow and you have to force yourself through the beginning, but, it has a lot of potential and I could see it turning into its own series of two or three games at least. It's a very common story but that also bodes well for it because it uses a formula that not only has been proven to work but has also proven to still be enjoyable today. It feels very much like the elder scroll series but I think that works very much in its favor. I'd recomend it if you're bored and not too picky about the graphics. If you're looking for something to occupy your time and is affordable, then play it. If you like the elder scroll series, play it. Just don't get too hung up on the particulars or else you won't be able to enjoy it. Keep an open mind and you'll get a pretty decent expreience."

Especially good if you do not have tens of hours to spent diving into the land of Tamriel.Pros:+ You can fly on a giant eagle given to you by a waterfall!+ You can also ride pterosaurs. I mean, do you have to read more?+ You fight giant carnosauts with a crossbow and a sword. Still not convinced?+ Fireball spell is actually a firethrower+ Runs on low-config old machines+ No game-breaking bugs+ All the boring parts of an open-world RPG have been ripped off the game+ Skill progression is rather entertaining+ Nice landscapes+ Beautiful music+ Ennemies attacks are nicely animated (especially the Raptors)+ Easy grinding+ Most voices are convincing+ You can be everything at once (mage, warrior, thief)Cons:- No depth in universe and in story- Very limited loot- Maps are empty- No proper dungeons- Lack of challenge- Ennemies are all of equal strength more or less- It is NOT Oblivion or Divinity II or Two Worlds or Risen or Gothic. Nothing of that kind here.Verdict: A casual, low ambition game, yet seriously fun. Short and fast-paced. And dinosaurs! And flight!Long version: This game is hard to judge. In every aspect, it tries to remind to you of Oblivion, especially in the first city, where the music is almost the same. And yet it is highly delusional. This game is a CASUAL open-world RPG. Seems paradoxical? Sure it is! A few examples: All merchants buy everything you have to sell at the same price. Lack of immersion, for sure, but it's fast and efficient. Houses are closed if there is no quest inside. People have no name if they do not have something to sell or some quest to give. Maps are quite simplistic, with no caves, no dungeons, only a few wandering ennemies that you can kill at will. They happen to respawn near instantly, but as they are very passive, it is only a massive grindfest.So, this game is subpar in every aspects. Everything is simplistic; but everything works as it supposed to do. Some landscapes are really nice and charming (the Terraces, for instance), music is nice and epic, fighting system is good, skills are a constant fun to improve, etc. If you can explore the different regions in any order, the game is quite linear in the sense that you have nothing to do in the so-called regions except a meagre handful of straightforward quests.This game provides a chep yet solid fun, which will content every one who like to hunt Raptors in the swamps with a magical sword and the sound of drums humming in the air."

They just stand around. The world doesn't feel alive in the slightest.It's also incredibly short. Look at the hours I have on record for this game, and yes, I've completed it.Honestly, if the developer cared enough to release regular updates, I'd probably change my opinion. Just go buy Morrowind if you don't already own it. The combat feels just as stiff, but at least you get an expansive, beautifully animated world in Morrowind."

,Recommended,253410,26351671,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,Sharp Income,"A greatly simplified action 'RPG'. You level up, increase stat points, not really any special skills. If you don't need shiny graphics, this game delivers some interesting and diversely themed locations to fight various monsters in: jungle with dinosaurs, snowy mountains with trolls, forest with goblins, deer & boars, plains with bears, caves with elves, tropical area with crabs and flying (i guess dinosaurs?). Combat is simple, you can block and attack with melee, or shoot with a bow. You can also equip a rune to 'shoot' elemental damage. There are both first and third person views available.I really enjoyed this game for it's simplicity. Nothing new I had to learn, no lore I had to cram my head full of in order to understand what was going on. No complex combat systems or complex item/equipment stat balances that required hours of deliberation to max my stats. (Each unique area: this gear sucks, this gear also sucks, this gear is good, this gear is the best) It was just an adventure with real time combat. Yes the graphics are very sub-par but I didn't need that, it was still fun to explorer all the unique environments. I played this almost exclusively for nearly a week until I beat it. (about 10hrs to finish) It was just so easy & simple to get into after work when I didn't have hours to invest in a deep, involved, time consuming RPG. Totally worth it on sale at 80% or 90% off."

It's a basic RPG you level different skills like swords or bows or magic by using them. You spend points on attributes and things like silent hunter for stealth or a walking faster skill which is nice. Basic normal rpg stuff. The typical side quests like find my missing brother or bring me 8 bear hides. The main quest is pretty generic so far hunt down pieces of a magic sword to I'm assuming eventually put it together and kill the big bad guy at the end and save the world.Honestly it's a fun little old school no surprises rpg that you can kill an afternoon with and for $1.74 that I spent on it it's perfectly fine.

I mean sure, it's pretty clunky here and there, it's not so tightly woven, and really, this could have been improved a smidge for the steam pc version. I think what many who are reviewing this so negatively are failing to realize or remember, is that this is actually a port. This was originally an app game on Amazon Apps and Google Play, not only that, but it's a pretty old app, a fair few years old. And as we all know, app games have come a long way since then to now. But still, if there may be any updates (hopefully) in the future, I would hope that this game would be updated,  revised, and expanded upon. It's not a bad premise in story, it's your basic medieval fantasy theme, and it's got all the basics of an rpg on set. It would be nice if this game were fixed up, but given what it was before steam pc, and how old it is with how limited it was when it was only in app stores, it's understandable as to it being the way it is.It's not the best, but I'd hardly label it the worst. I've seen worse than this, a lot worse. Some even here on Steam.It's pretty traditional, but it's still pretty good. As long as ya realize what this game essentially was before hand, it's actually not so bad"
