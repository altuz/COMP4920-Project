Content in this review is subject to change when the product gets modified. If you would like to contact the developers with your opinions about this product or suggest future updates, contact them atsupport@digitaldnagames.com.Since its launch on Steam in February 2014 this game has been criticized for having a multitude of issues ranging from having absolutely no graphic or control settings to no communication options. Recently, this product hasimplementedthe following:●Resolution settings.You can now change the resolution in-game!●Render distance settings.Lowest, Low, Medium, High, and Ultra.●Texture quality settings.Low, Medium and High.These settings were needed in order to call this a PC game. Now that these issues have been addressed, allow me to criticize some of the things they have recently implemented and the things they still haven't. They recently implemented a fairly large health bar at the top of the screen. I find this rather odd considering health in Castle Miner Z almost immediately regenerates. I would prefer if I could move this around or just turn it off all together. Along with a nice retexture of every block in the game, they've also added a new blue user interface.The game still lacks a variety of enemies, blocks, an antialiasing setting and a voice chat system. Also, text communication is rather limited. For example, if I wanted to say ""Hello everyone, how are you all doing?"" I would only have 5 characters left afterward. You also do not have the ability to paste characters.February 2014:Castle Miner Z's Controls Initial ReleaseCastle Miner Z's Graphic settings Initial ReleaseMarch 2014:Castle Miner Z's Controls in March 2014Castle Miner Z's Graphic settings in March 2014May 2014:Castle Miner Z's Controls in May 2014Castle Miner Z's Graphic settings in May 2014Unfortunately, there are still some major issues plaguing Castle Miner Z, I've listed a few below.●Save Data Deletion Upon Every Update.This is serious, what's the point in playing in the first place if everything you accomplish is refreshed after every major update?●Lack of Voice Chat Functionality.Currently the only means of communication in-game is a very limited text system.●Lack of NPC Variety.Understandably not every game has to have 30+ different models of enemies but different reskins of dragons, zombies, skeletons and Demons with the same exact sound effects just aren't enough.●Lack of Block Variety.A larger variety of things to craft with resources would have been great additions. Dirt, rock, wood, ore, Bloodstone, weapons, explosives, doors, and walls is what I would expect from an Alpha.Many of you commenting think I am hypocritical by spending over 300 hours in this game, I find this rather absurd. If anything, you should consider the time I spent on this game as thorough testing of the product. For those of you wondering, 2/3 of the time I spent playing this game went towards an achievement that requires you run the game consecutively for 100 hours. The first time I attempted this achievement the memory leakage was so horrid it immbolized my PC after the first three days. I tried it once again in windowed mode and succeeded."

,Not Recommended,253430,8965476,"Posted: 3 February, 2014",all,Lyn,"CastleMiner Z.. where do I even begin? CastleMiner Z is a Voxel FPS Horror game where your only goal seems to survive or go farther from your starting point, and go progress to get higher tiers to fight the zombies with.First of all, the graphics; They are very poor and need work, and a lot of times glitch out.Secondly there's the Gameplay: The gameplay is decent, but get's very repetitive, with nothing much to do other than go farther away from spawn and try not to die. The guns are very unabalanced and need work aswell. For a survival game, suprisingly you don't have to eat or anything, you can literally just sit in a hole in a mountain or something and not get killed ever, and once you're aware of that it becomes very stale.Third of all, Optimization: This game isn't optimized very well, and has laggy FPS even on good computers. The porting from Xbox 360 to PC/Steam is poor aswell and feels like they put no effort into it. Even the Xbox 360 controller buttons are still there. It's missing basic features like a ingame chat that should be there already.Lastly, the bugs. This game has a lot of bugs, like.. a lot of bugs. How could a game be released like this? Sonic 06 all over again.  This game is okay, but needs imporvement, I wouldn't recommend it right now.I'd recommend making this a early access game if possible, it has potential, but it feels like your not using it. It's very lacking right now. 04/10 at it's current state (1.6.3.3)"

The only things that you can craft are basic building blocks from wood gathered, tools (just like the ones in Minecraft), and an assortment of guns. It's too simple! There's no need to make a crafting table in order to make better weapons, there's no form of armor, and there's no need to build a furnace to smelt the ore that you've collected during your mining adventures. I can't stress this enough. It's too simple!Secondly, the game is really hard, despite it's simplicity. Even playing on Easy mode, the zombies would kill me in just 3 hits, which is ridiculous. To make matters worse, when you die, all of the items in your inventory are gone. Poof, vanished into thin air, so even if you manage to get back to where you were killed, you can't collect any of your stuff that you had worked so hard for. Oh, and did I mention that the zombies spawn almost right next to you? Yeah, random spawn points for ALL of the enemies, based entirely on where you are. In other words, you are the spawn point for enemies. It's really unfair, especially when they take an entire clip to kill, can run at you faster than you can run yourself, and can kill you in 3 F#$KING HITS EVEN ON EASY MODE! Oh yeah, and a Dragon will come by and F#$k your s#$t up royally every couple of days...Which brings me to my next issue. The day/night cycle on this game is absurd. Days only last a few minutes at best, and the night lasts forever! I got into the game, was looking through the UI for the crafting and by the time I had understood how everything worked, it was night time and I was getting my face ripped off by a zombie. It's ludicrous how short the days are and how long the nights are. SERIOUSLY needs to be reworked.Lastly, and this is just a nitpicky thing, the sensitivity is really high, and even when you adjust it, it doesn't change anything. When you're in standard view, if you twitch in any direction, you'll practicially do a 180, but when you aim down the sight, you're lucky to get the damn thing to move. It's very unpolished. Honestly, I'd stick to Minecraft if you're looking for a sandbox crafting type game, it has way more to do, the enemies are balanced and won't continually spawn right next to you, and if you die, you can at least get your stuff back (if you manage to get back to the spot where you died fast enough)"

I have waited as long as 5 minutes to no avail.I seem to run into this error about 1/5 times.When I am able to access the list of player servers I am having slightly better luck today, but still about 1/2-3/4 of the times I try to connect to one I am presented with an ambiguous error message of no use to me in troubleshooting whatever problem may exist. The text of this error is as follows:""Connection ErrorConnection failed: Host DisconnectedOk""Also if I accidently try to join a server that requires a password, the cancel button on the dialogue box allowing you to enter a password does not work. When I click it nothing happens at all. I have to select ok which takes me to the same ambiguous error message as above and then to the main menu.Now that I have gone out of my way to reinstall your game and spent about 45 minutes to an hour of my time troubleshooting for you, I would ask that you contact me directly or through steam and offer me a refund on the $8.49 that I spent yesterday on your hastily released title.2nd edit: The steam support ticked I opened that has yet to receive a response is ticket #5897-WEYV-9696."

There's no brightness adjustment (it says brightness in the options menu but is really a bad gamma balancer) which is terrible because the game is very dark, especially since it's never anything but cloudy.All in all, I very much love the concept of this game, but it was attempted very very poorly.3/10"

Being a young dumb 15 year old back in 2011, I would search the Indie Game marketplace endlessly in search of finding a fun cheap game. Minecraft was all the rage at the time, so when I discovered this gem, I thought it would be a fun alternative to minecraft. The graphics were more unique and different from minecrafts, zombies and dragons to fend off (Not to mention the aliens that would be released later on), and it had GUNS. An alternative to minecraft... with guns! The map for this game was very unique, as you travel further north east south or west, you experience forests, floating islands, deserts, mountains, and much more. Not to mention a Hell world with endless amounts of zombies and devils. You can travel the map or set up a homebase or both, so this game really is adventurous! I mean sure, the graphics arent top notch, but what would you expect from a cheap indie game? The graphics really dont hurt the gameplay, unless youre running on Windows 95 or 98.

,Not Recommended,253430,14042609,"Posted: 17 January, 2015",all,Mr. Timéstámp-é,"GoldeMan's (very) Lengthy Review of CastleMinerZ!CastleMinerZ, originally on the Xbox finally comes to the PC, but how does it hold up? Not well... if I am honest.PROS:+ For one, there is actuallya pretty interesting gameplay idea, what you do in this game is, kind of similar with Temple Run mixed with MineCraft where you gather materials to go out further and further in the tretarous land to find the Undead dragon where the world ends. The further you go out into the world the more zombies spawn and if you and all your allies fall, you are stripped of your inventory (Not your hotbar) and are sent back to the start. The best way to explain it is Temple Run meets Minecraft, which is pretty interesting, but unfortinutley like all the other mechanics in this game are pretty half baked and or not inplemented at all, but more on that later, and if I COULD play Dragon Endurance it currently sounds quite nice.+The graphicsare pretty nice as of 1.7 as they have retextured every block and monster in the game, making it more like a fresh game than a dull uninspired clone which is what it looked of before. (And the sky looks fantastic at night)+The music is actually nice. Yes, it does come out of nowhere but it does sound nice. (My personal favorite is the song that plays when you enter the desert!)+A nice variety of weaponsfrom shotguns to lazer swords!+The ambiance in caves is really creepyand nice. Yes, the sounds are pretty lacking (check the cons section) but whenever I first walked into a cave and heard the dripping of water I felt like I was not welcome. Then, I heard the rattling of the skeletons and I was scared stiff!+Game CAN be fun at times.Playing this game every once in a while is actually a fun time, sure after a while the difficulty really hurts me wanting to progress but it is fun either way! I even trying to livestream it every once in a while, and everytime my friend comes over this is a game we play!CONS:(I really hate to do this but the time has come)+Extremley unbalanced and near impossible.What I mean by this is one zombie (which mind you dozens of them spawn) can knock you down to under half health and they are relentless with attacks, which would be cool BUT once you are near them or their body collides with your, you slow down to a crawl and you have no choice but to look around to see it hit you once and once more spawning you back and the beginning and the hours upon hours of grinding lost. Weapons are not explained well and sometimes a weapons shoots further or has better accurancy than what it should be (IE: A pistol has better aim than a RIFLE!) And while on the topic of accuracy, aiming on sights does absolutley nothing, the only thing it does is move your model to the crosshair and even then the bullets still go wherever the hell they want. Finally, once you walk not even 100 blocks from the tower at spawn a dragon will spawn, this is a HUGE problem as most players want to explore a bit more and grasp game concepts before a freaking boss is thrown at them.+Animations are broken beyond belief:Player animations are glitching with clipping polygons (or whatever they are) and zombies just slide along the ground when they fail to catch a player only for them to despawn for no apparent reason. Players look slightly to the left than what the model shows and aiming on sights doesn't even have a model change on Multiplayer.+Multiplayer syncing is BROKEN: Sometimes mobs spawn and other players wont see them, but they are there client side and thus causes confusion between players and causes a waste of ammo from other players and being attacked and killed in 2 hits by an invisible mob is not fun, especially in a very lengthy non saving campaign like this. (If you are going to make a comment complaining somehow then use the word Bannana in it so I know you read the review)+Mobs are completley broken and don't function logically:First off, no fall damage for the enemy so falling into the depths of hell is just a rash in the rear for our fellow enemies! Secondly, after not hitting a player for about 10 seconds the enemy stumbles around and just dissapears which helps to levelize the mobs in the game but it extremley wonky and doesn't feel right at all. The AI is VERY predictable, if a zombie jumps to you just move back a bit and you can catch him easily. Oh, and Skeletons can spawn in lit caves.+VERY LITTLE VARIETY IN BLOCKS AND MOBS!Only a mere 5 mobs exist in the game, and 3 of those 5 spawn in specific locations (Dragons are 1 per biome, Aliens are at space ships, and Demons are in hell only. And dragons should have more attacks with their different varieties. Blocks, HEH! In CastleMinerZ there are a mere 13 or so blocks in the game, making castle building tideous and boring and very very unsatifying.+Survival has little to no point,as the world generates in a set pattern, and what is the point of survival as most people say? ""Find a nice place to settle and survive the night"" well, it still uses the same generation as Endurance which causes you to be forced to stay in the first biome of the world.+Endurance world generation is way too predictable,If you made someone play Endurance twice a week apart and didnt tell them the world was randomly generated I'm pretty sure they wouldn't even notice as it always goes in the same order and with little variety in the biomes infact I can name them all here: (I also have some opinions on the current biome list)1. Plains2. Floating Islands3. Desert (More like a flat land, here and on Space Ships spawn)4. Mountains5. Snow6. Ore Lands (Just the above ground being gone and just caves exist pretty terrible)7. Hell (You can get to hell in the first 5 minutes by digging down 40-50 blocks which is TINY for a cave system to change into a whole new world)+Mining is boring!With a little over 4 ore types it sufferes even when the word ""Miner"" is in the name! It feels like a chore every time with and just makes me want to quit the game early just becuase there is no variety in the below.+Sounds and Music Placement,while admittedly the music is pretty nice, it comes out of nowhere and doesn't have a point, maybe if it played after you killed a dragon it'd be a nice reward. The sounds are TERRIBLE with very low quality sounds and some really obveous freesounds sounds (My friend pointed most of the royality free sounds (findsounds/freesounds) which is rediculous and just don't sound nice at all, with the constant wind blowing and the really terrible zombie sounds and the annoying clacking of the skeletons which could be scary but the poor audio direction along with the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor sound engine doesn't help at all.CONCLUSION:Overall CastleMinerZ is a poor Minecraft inspired game that has little variety a POOR difficulty curve spanning from easy to balls-to-the-wall-hard in 5 mintues and awful sound direction really hurt what could otherwise be a unique block game. Maybe soon they will fix everything, but at the time it is not recomended in the slightest."

The point of this game (Could be better advertised) is to get as far from where you start as possible. The world and the enemies change and get harder the further you go. Think of it as an arcade game, albeit with a lot of freedom and strategy and some nice multiplayer dynamics. To avoid confusion. It's not Minecraft. If you're looking for a Minecraft experience you will be somewhat disapointed. If you try to play it as though it's Minecraft you will be somewhat disapointed.

Block textures look better than minecraft, but the monsters look like they belong to the era of N64-Playing alone is boring-Occasional bugs-The game is dead. The developer came back to post something along the lines of ""We won't abandon you"", then went silent to this community while they work on The Savage Lands. If you buy this, never expect an update.Over all, it isn't a terrible game. It was made the way it is for reasons, and it could in theory continue to evolve and get better since the move to PC, but it seems dead now.

Many are quick to judge on something they play for 5 minutes, then write a bandwagon review to fit in. Cute.My play time isnt the highest, but I never played it on here originally, I played on the 360 first, saw it had a more devoted PC port, then switched to it.It's a SURVIVAL game, people complain about it not having a point. They say it's a Minecraft clone, but Minecraft is just as pointless, good job. The point is to not die. There.If you know how to play the game, you can get laser weapons in like 6 mins tops.If you cant find a server, play solo! It's not that hard to play alone.If you recieved it for free, lucky you! You get a free five minutes to play then complain in reviews!I've enjoyed this game thoroughly, it's been fun to play with my friend, and fun to play alone. I appreciate the time the devs take to respond and pace their updates. I like the non-toxic playerbase. I like the direction this game could go if people would stop tying it down to try and kill it.I like the game.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The only bad things I have about this game are:The balancing of early zombies/skellies/dragons.The fact that at about 25k blocks out you start to just walk through blocks in a linear line away and towards the spawn.Gun models are a bit poor too, but that's not a major concern, they fulfill their functions properly.Frame rate tanks during dragon fireballs, but not enough to dstroy the gameplay.OP alien health.Teleport load times sometimes freeze on 50% for a minute or two.Zombies slowing you down, you escaping, them standing where they were before, then slapping you to death if they aren't dead yet.PvP being off but damaging other players with explosives.Laser swords having low durbility.Zombies sailing around your head while you desperately try to shoot them.Aliens spawnin every two seconds while trying to get space rock/goo.Skeleton snipers.~Suggestions for devs:Tweak the zombie speed and jumping a bit, really hard to get a bead on anything if there's more than one of them.Another enemy class, tankier and slow, high close range dmg, medium long range dmg/faster, low dmg, actively tries to stay hidden/enemy support unit?/more boss units, including some minions.A random gen world mode would be cool, buildings already made and such, zombie apocalypse type dealy. Or just different map types.Craftable armor.More melee options than a knife/laser sword/axe. Maybe swords. Ranged melee would be cool too, like kunai or something.Different dmg types, like pshysical, fire, ice, that kind of stuff.Enemy health bars. Please. Fighting dragons is enough without having to guess its health.L A S E R   L M GCrafting different laser weapon colors exhibits some sort of effect, red, blue, green, yellow, that sort of thing, but different for each weapon class, Rifles focusing more on blatant range/dmg with additional piercing or elemental effects, SMGs focusing on status effects like slow/poison/fire/freeze, shotguns having projectile effects (Slug, Shorter range/wider spread/more pellets, field choke), Assault rifles having dmg over time and fire rate effects, pistols having supportive effects for you and other people, not necessarily those exact one, but you get my point.Gun attachments would be cool, but not necessary.Decrease energy loss when sprinting/double jumping. P L E A S E.Different player models.Water in-game.A few more biomes, maybe have the maps vary on which ones are present.Different start locations other than the generic grassy forest place.Love it or hate it, it's all down to preference I guess.I'd really appreciate the devs taking their time to read through this and responding with feedback, I've seen it a couple times.Player feedback is appreciated too.~Doge"

I don't have all but like, under 2 hours logged but this game has a special place in my heart.Let me take you back to the year 2011. Minecraft wasn't out yet, and my xbox had a red ring of death. So, for that christmas (And my birthday, I also have my birthday on christmas). I got a new Xbox 360, I got on Xbox live, my friend Nich and my friend Ben started telling me about this game called Castle Miner Z. That's when the fun began, see... Before this we didn't have minecraft so we had to play alternatives such as Fortresscraft and total miner. Both games I had fun with, but not to the extent that I had with castle miner z. This game was hard as BALLS! You would die... And die... And die...But eventually in the timespan I mastered this ♥♥♥♥ing game. The first time me and my ""clan"" killed a dragon it scared me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but after a while I started to really master it. So for about 5 months we played this game, pretty much everyday for about 6 hours... If I logged a lot of time into this game. Eventually we built a whole ♥♥♥♥ing kingdom with a hierarchy and everything. It was insane, people building and adding on. In the hierarchy, I was somewhere at the top, with my friend Nich being the leader so we were tight. Eventually he decided to give me my own kingdom. So after a while I searched went to this strange floating island and built a guard tower, a church, a hotel, and it was amazing. Another time we went to hell and built a huge underground tunnel. It was great, we dug out holes to kill a bunch of demons. It was great.After a while, the game began to die down with the release of minecraft on the Xbox. But this game will forever be in my heart for the epic moments of victory we had. But yesterday, 5 years later I bought it on steam... It was good, the framerate was laggy, I don't really like the new inventory system, but I can look past it. I also watched TotalBiscuit's review on the game and, it cut deep. I don't have anything against totalbiscuit in general, but I don't think he understood what it was like in 2011 and 2012 playing this game, it was the best alternative to minecraft we had. The part that really cut me deepest was that part where he ripped on that one song que, maybe it was altered in this version... But the first time I heard that sound que it felt really epic. I was walking out into the world with some other people, and I crossed a desert pass. It felt really amazing.To wrap this review up, I would only reccomend it to you if you played it on the 360 in that time when you didn't have anything else to play.Back then I would have given it a solid 8.5/10.But in the end I think it deserves a solid 7.5 in my eyes."

Not as much as back on Xbox but it's still a good game. It isn't as much as a Minecraft rip off as it may seem to be. There is a great exploration system, multiple zombie types, aliens, space guns, and a lot of dragons. Not to mention you can fight Satan himself. Don't believe me?

After 5 hours or so, I had the highest tier weaponry, and traveled out 10,000 + Blocks. That's only on singleplayer, which is one of this game's weak points. Playing 6+ more hours with my friend was enjoyable, but tedious, and at times, too easy. Enemies couldn't get close enough to our fort to damage it when we reached diamond-tier weapons. On the topic of weapons, there is no armor in this game, so you will be stuck with getting killed in 2-3 hits, if they get close enough to hit you.Also, their are maybe 5 enemy types in the game: Zombie, Skeleton, Skeletal archer, A demon, and a dragon, each with different coloration of themselves. The Demon (Which me and my friend cleverly called Satan) Spawns in the underworld, and anywhere else randomly after entering hell. This wouldn't be a problem at all, if you could kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Normally (I.E by Wiki's standard) you should be able to kill him after obtaining bloodstone weaponry (cleverly, bloodstone is only found in hell.) However, there seemed to of been a glitch which bullets, and even lazer weaponry, would pass right through him. (And the undead dragon). This may have been only in our case, nontheless, unacceptable.A mentioned earlier, that enemies rarely got close enough to us to hurt us. To dabble on that more, guns after iron tier really are just too powerful. It takes maybe two bullets from an autorifle, which has a clip size of 30, to kill zombies and skeletons. And it takes just under a clip or two to kill a dragon.To close up this rather long review, when this game goes on sale for 1 dollar (or regional amount) then this is worth the sudo 12 hours you get out of it, otherwise, avoid like the plague."

The game seemed dead but after 2-3 years the devs started to carry on the potential of CMZ. Many people's faces were happy again. Including mine.Yes the game may be like minecraft but thats just because of blocks and mining. The game itself has many other things that make it unique than to call it a ripoff. Guns, different enemy types of the same species, different blocks, graphics, concept and there's more. However the multiplayer is still continued since those 2-3 years. Servers can be hosted with a few clicks and played on for as long as you want. You can have it only open to friends or for anyone. There is almost no lag at all either!

I used to play the game on xbox, and when i saw it on Steam i was very excited. For one the community isent that good. If you join a game with pvp, you get kicked if you kill someone. If you host your own game, prepare for greifing and your crates being ramsacked. It is basicly minecraft with guns but there are better mechanics (inventory,crafting,block stacking etc.) The guns are unbalanced. The assault rifle is the only gun i can kill dragons with. But the other guns are fun to screw around with. And it's fun to shoot everything with the overpowered lazer guns.7/10 ~ would lazer gun again"

,Recommended,253430,30422820,Posted: 10 March,all,John Nathaniel,"This game is amazing for a minecraft like mining game.This game is not intirely a minecraft clone. Yes, you can mine stuff, but the game focuses more on exploration than survival. On of the most favorite things I like about this game is that it has guns, including Alien blasters. I also like defeating the dragons as they arw fun and challenging. There is a lack in variety in enemies, instead the game has different colored versions of enemies (ie. bright greeb, red, blue varients) that just make them stronger depending on the color. There is no passive animals. You WILL DIE EASILY in this game, enemies do ridiculous amounts of damage and at most times, attack you like a machine gun. Even on easy mode, it's still kinda the same, just an extra one or two hits before dying. Also, there are glitches, which seem more common in multiplayer. The most common glitch is getting stuck in blocks, which can happen by somehow placing a block at your position or runing at a weird angle. In multiplayer they is a rare chance a chunk loading error will happen, making a whole part of the world invisable. A restart always fixes this, but is nuisance to have to restart the game. The game also takes time to start up ANDif you switch to another window while it is loading the game up, therw WILL be missing assets such as invisable enemies and items, bugged out textures for items and enemies, and a few other problems. You must restart the game to fix this.I really like the auto climb feature, as now I don't have to jump over ever ledge in terrain, which you know in voxel block auto generated gamesis extremely common.Another thing I like is the stanima bar, I know ir can be annoying, but it adds to what the game is trying to emphasize:don't go out at night.Enemies usually run at fast speeds outrunninv you, which is where sprinting comes in. I LOVE SPRINTING as it allows you to quickly travel, but here's the catch:sprinting uses stanima.Also the amount of biomes are cool, from a desert to the ore mountains, this game will keep you exploring. You can also enter hell if you mine deep enough. One thing that this game is missing is water and lava with physics. Sure there is lava, but it acts like a static block that damages you. I don't like the addition of loot blocks, they sometimes can give you OP weapons very early in the game (I'm looking at you laser shotgun). Also, in creative mode, spawn TO MUCH! Creative mode isn't what you think, it just lets you place ulmited blocks and have infinite resources. NO you can't fly AND NO you can't give yourself items in a menu like minecraft. One cool thing is that zombies can break through soft blocks like wood and dort, forcing you to build your house out of strong materials like iron blocks, stone, etc. The game works with steamworks meaning you can just invite friends over steam. Multiplayer is ok. You can't change your appearance like in the xbox 360 version; meaning that EVERYONE will look exactly the same (as police SWAT soldiers?). Unless yoy have a good connection, you are going to get lag. There are also some wolrd sycning issues in multiplayer, for instance: My friend sees a spider spawner and tells me to break it, yet I tell him I can't see it. Then later the same thing happens to him. One last thing, the items in your toolbar will stay with you at death. There are two toolbars and you can switch bstween the two.I'd say for an xbox 360 port, this is actually pretty good. Ironically, it also supports xbox 360 controllers for input.Hope this wall of text review was helpful,-John Nathaniel"

,Not Recommended,253430,28689879,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,copy.sh,"To begin, CastleMiner Z is a 3D sandbox game with a block-like filled environment that features a large variety of weapons and a few items that the player can craft, as well as dragons to fight, with zombies, skeletons, and aliens to kill. It does not compare itself to Minecraft, Infiniminer, Fortresscraft, or Total Miner whatsoever and should never be considered a ""spin-off"" of any of these games.CastleMiner is a decent game from what I've experienced. Playing offline seems like a lot of fun... and it really is.However, I do have a lot of problems to mention about this game.1.Zombies are too fast and kill too often, almost impossible to kill.This is a common issue on CastleMiner Z. As the player encounters a zombie anywhere on the map, they will most likely start to run fast, targeting the player, and lunges at them, usually dealing 40% damage on the player when the player only has 100 health. Sometimes this is even more of a problem because the zombie has the ability to clip through the player, allowing the zombie to hit the player twice as fast and dealing more damage than expected. Zombies are just too fast when they are running at the player. It's not easy to shoot them when you got a Pistol that only has 200 Bullets when they're jumping around like nuts. Also, they are literally impossible to actually kill. I have to use up almost all of my 8 rounds to take out a single zombie, and my aim is very accurate, these zombies seem to have a lot more health than what the player actually has.2.The game does not have that many blocks nor items to allow the player to use.There are only a certain amount of blocks in this game. Let's say if I wanted to do pixel art in this game, the chances of me doing so would be certainly low. You cannot obtain or craft coloured blocks in this game at all, which IMO looks very dull. I should be able to go into Creative mode and know that there will be more blocks for me to use, however there isn't.""So, what blocks did you encounter in the game today, bud?"",""Grass, trees, grass, sand, grass, grass, rock, grass, dirt, and more grass.""3.I chopped down 7 trees, none of them grow back.I don't even realize if this is a bug or if this wasn't even bothered to be implemented to the game yet, but I figured that trees in the game donotgrow back. This might be a stupid example, but if I wanted to craft 100 Doors, and I didn't have enough wood because all of my trees are chopped down, would they grow back? Well, from what I have seen, I don't think they do. Trees in this game are good for the first time you chop them down, but going to them the second time, they are practically useless. All you have left from these trees are leaves, and they never seem to decay at all.Oh, and you can walk through these leaves. They're not solid blocks.4.Stamina is pointless and runs out too quickly.I'm always playing in Survival and there is always a Stamina bar, correct? Stamina is pointless to me most of the time, but other times could be useful. It allows you to double-jump (pressing SPACE twice) and allows you to sprint (LEFT SHIFT). A problem I occassionally have with this is that Stamina runs out too quickly, though. I even timed myself to see how quick Stamina actually runs out for. After approximately2 secondsof sprinting, your Stamina goes from 100% to 0% instantly. Wow, how useful is that. I couldtotallyrun out a zombie in this game.And finally...5.Hosts on multiplayer games, they're all idiots.This has to be one of the worst things I have actually experienced when playing CastleMiner Z, the hosts on multiplayer servers. I might as well just not play Multiplayer at all because I feel hatred whenever I join a game. Fun fact, I joined20sessions in one day. I've been kicked from all of them because ALL of the hosts tell me the same thing:""Sorry, friends only!""""Gtfo noob""...or just kick me for no good reason. They're acting like immature people. I haven't done anything wrong to these people, and I am clueless of who they are, and they kick me from games when I did absolutely nothing wrong?Congratulations, CastleMiner Z, you haven't redeemed yourself one bit."

Despite the zombies looks (Which are actually good) Overall the game is ASTONISHING.  Gives a more immersive survival and even a more immersive mode called endurance.

You could mine, craft, build, explore, and fight zombies and dragons, but thats where the makers stopped updating the game. I mean sure, its fun for the first few hours when you have nothing and have plans to get the best weapons the game has to offer, and the best base you can possably build, but once you do that it's pretty  much go to the surface kill mobs, run out of ammo, make more ammo, and do it again. The developers abandoned this game to work on a new game which has recently been released. Upon completing that project they returned to CastleMinerZ to get new content out, but those ideas were brought to a halt when realizing the code was old and unable to be used. Recently they have been talking about a possable CastleMinerZ 2. So I would reccomend waiting to see if they decide to make that instead of wasting your money on this game."

If you haven't played it on the xbox 360, I would try this out if you can pick it up for $.99 (currently 3 or 4 dollars when I wrote this review). If you have played it on 360, there a few new things that were added such as respawn beacons and teleports (permanent ones) that could amuse you.Originally, I was never going to buy this game on PC. I played extensively on 360 and even bought all the Digital DNA titles that gave perks for CMZ (basically $1 dlc) and made it around 20000 blocks or so from the start in Endurance (whatever they call the non-save mode) and didn't really want to go through the game again.Then I saw the updates and things they added recently and thought, ""Hey, they did something with this finally. Maybe they are going to keep updating regularly."" Well, I'm not sure how much dedication is going into this as they currently have their project Savage Lands to work on (going really well actually, updates monthly give or take a week). But to finish my thought, those measly updates they pushed out with a few new blocks and a couple new items were not worth my repurchase of this game. Not to mention this is a really old engine, so even if there is a major update of CMZ it will probably be a new game.There's very little replayability to this game once you beat the undead dragon (final boss) unless you help your friends through to beat him (which I did a few times). Typically the grind to getting the gear to beat the dragon then traveling out to the 4000 some distance to fight him takes 4ish hours by yourself and maybe an hour or 2 with friends. The fight can be difficult or overly easy. First time I fought the dragon, there were only bloodstone weapons in the game. I didn't succeed before one of the fireball vollies managed to kill me in my floating base. The next time I actually took the time to go out to kill the dragon in endurance mode was when the alien update was released. That time I used the Dragon Seeking Missiles to fight him and built my base on the ground out of space goo. Two missiles and I won. I went ""Oh, okay. Glad that wasn't a pain."" But any veteran of CMZ can tell you, once you fight one dragon, you've fought them all, so don't expect much.So basically the game boils down to - Grind. March. Die. March. Die. March and finally make it. Die. March back by teleporting. Kill the undead dragon and then rarely, if ever, play again. But remember, this was (and still is) an Indie game! It is well worth a dollar. $1 That's about it though. 2-20 hours of play time."

The first thing that happened when I played single player was me getting attacked by zombies endlessly. First things first, the zombies are horribly made. They jump like theyre on the moon and kill you in 2-3 hits, which is absurd in its own. Zombies also spawn randomly at random places, which is just frustrating in its own right. They also break blocks which makes creating a wooden house useless because its going to be molested and destroyed the first night anyway. Not to mention also that the health is just completely broken dispite it looking quite simple. If they were going to copy MC, why not just have hearts instead of a health bar that drains so damn quick. This wouldnt be a problem if armour was a thing. The early game guns are trash at best, and the late game ones I havent even gotten to try because every time I die due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness of the early game guns my inventory clears and theres no way to recover it. It also annoys me how day is so short, but night is so long. When I first played I just learned the game and it was already night and me getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in all my slots. It is also left out that the durability of tools in this game is non existent in the sense that pickaxes break after about 50 blocks broken and guns break after around 1500 bullets shot.

Every tool does exactly what it's supposed to do, though they could last a bit longer by not being damaged from every strike on whatever block, but instead being damaged from every resource mined, dug, hacked, etc. Teleporting is a very nice feature, one not many games of this genre have. I don't like being disconnected from servers, but the plus side is that I automatically get a copy of the world I was playing in, meaning I can loot everyone's stuff and grief whatever I feel has been done wrong.

,Recommended,253430,9604570,"Posted: 23 March, 2014",all,Sovereign ♔,"First thing you will notice is it's a clear rip of Minecraft. That aside, there is an actual goal rather than boring sandbox stuff. Rather than how far underground you go, more exciting things happen the further away you get from the spawn point (Spire), measuring distance in blocks at the top right. The weapons and bullets and junk are all the same, but it's essential to make weapons and tools out of rarer materials as the zombies, skeletons, demons, and aliens get pretty hard to kill. Not to mention random dragons flying around like it's Skyrim. It's fun cranking up the difficulty and seeing how long you can hold out in a fort, or hauling your items with you as you try to reach the farthest distance you can and digging a pit at night to stay safe from the infinite swarm of zombies.Now the cons. Not too many, most of them are a tad annoying but it takes getting used to. But dying is definitely the worst. If playing on normal difficulty or under, when you die every item that's not in your hotbar gets dropped and you appear back at spawn maybe fifty blocks away or six-thousand; just like in minecraft. But the items dissappear after a few mere seconds, so unless you died pretty close all your hard earned ores and junk will dissappear before you reach them. Though this problem is pretty much removed if you play with friends, as they can pick up your dropped junk.Overall a pretty interesting game, definitely worth playing on a Friday night with some other losers."

Castleminer Z is obviously supposed to be played with a group meaning if you decide to try to solo this (heaven forbid try that on endurance mode) you're going to die... horribly. This game needs to be balanced for single player, melee enemies sometimes hit you twice, bringing you down to next to no health, the game explains absolutly nothing to you like, zombies can break sand and dirt, dragons blow up sand and dirt and higher teir blocks depending on the type of dragon, gold weapons do more damage than iron, diamond weapons do more damage than gold (ect). However, with that said it's something I could see worth picking up if it was on sale, with the pricetag of 10 bucks (4 times what I paid for console) it's a bit tougher telling anyone to buy it.Negatives aside, pricetag aside, stupid, screaming little kids telling me to ""kil teh dargoyn""  it's a pretty neat game. You have endurance mode, presents quite a bit of a challenge though again, they need to balance it. It has a few little gadgets like the teleporter, the anti-dragon guided missile. The weapons sound... alright, I think they could have done a bit better but in an indie title sound is the first thing to go, and understandibly so.So to wrap it up... Yea, it's alright though it is a multiplayer game and the community sucks, play with a friend or risk punching a hole through your screen in frustration. Pick it up if it ever goes on sale if you're not willing to deal with the bugs."

It is a game that you and some friends can sit down and play for 5 hours and then never play again. The game is braindead easy, as you can bypass all conventional methods of mining by entering the Hell zone immediately and killing low health mobs for virtually unlimited resources. Also, if you back into a wall, you pass into it. You can do this to literally get absurd distances with no effort. The zombies jump incredible distances and will almost always end up behind you.

Lets just start off by saying I play CSGO, in CSGO I have my sensitivity at around 1.30-1.40. This game dosen't let you change your sensitivity at all. I'm basicly walking around while my mouse goes zooming around my screen at the slightest of movement. Don't even get me started on the nasty sounds or the hardcore amounts of damage you take along with the insane HP regen.

Please read on to see what I mean.I only recommend this game because of it's nearly unlimited fun it contains when playing with a group of friends (At least 2-4 other people). This isn't a game I would play alone because there isn't too much to do; once you get to laser weapons and such you're pretty much done. But with friends, you tend to ignore all the cons of this unpolished indie adventure game so to speak and just enjoy exploring and slaying enemies/dragons with your friends, making the experience much more enjoyable.Not to mention, you can get this game on the castle miner site for FREE. The only reason I see to purchase this via steam is to game with friends. To conclude, don't buy this game unless you have friends that are down for it. Besides all that, great game in my opinion, could use lots more work and updates but sadly the owners abandoned the game. Had great potentialR.I.P Castle-Miner Z 8/8 would get chased by Satan again for another $2"

There are also some futuristic features such as lazer guns and swords if you ever wanted to be a jedi or storm trooper. If you don't like getting owned by the undead from the underworld, you can turn the monsters off. The game's visuals are amazing! It runs super quick even on my laptop! It still runs great even with a high visual setting. If building is more your cup of tea, then try the creative mode.

No, I do not actually believe this... The game is hopeless, the devs do nothing, and it is at a dead-end in a bad stage. Don't actually buy it because I made a gushing review as a joke...)I am going to be honest though, at the time of writing this, I did delusion myself into having false hope for this game. I was desperate enough to believe almost anything would just replace Minecraft already and bring back what it had originally for me and in the Golden Age of Modding.  Go look at 7 Days To Die. Their dev team is constantly actually getting♥♥♥♥♥♥done.As soon as 7 Days To Die has full mod support, this thing goes obsolete. Once that happens, which is planned and looks that it soon will, everything this game contains and more will be in 7DTD in better quality, guranteed. If anything, put your money, support, and hope into 7 Days To Die and not here. Personally, at the moment, I do feel that 7DTD is missing enough supernatural or fantasy elements to hold my attention and is a little too hardcore on the realism. (Hate me for wanting magic and♥♥♥♥♥♥in my zombie game if you like) I am likely one of the few in the community with this opinion, however, I love everything about 7 Days To Die and would play the hell out of it (And host servers for it) if it had a few elements to my personal taste. As soon as mods are an option in 7DTD, I think I will have found my new favorite game of all time.Also, just to specify, I don't want 7 Days to Die to ever be less realistic, I absolutely love how indepth they go into the situation and survival and how much thought and care they put into it. The thing is, all of it seems so...normal, that it just feels like a base to add onto for me. For possibly more understanding of where I am coming from, perhaps read my other reviews.OLD REVIEW (READ AT YOUR OWN RISK, IT'S BAD):This game is like a combination of elements from 7 Days to Die, Terraria, Minecraft, Unturned, and others. The game is still being worked on, the devs are active, and they care. This has the potential to fill the void for older audiences after the fall and cringe-takeover of Minecraft.It is by no means a copy of anything just because of it's genre, even though it is still kind of finding it, it has it's own unique identity.There is currently a bit of a lack of content, but that is being remedied as this is being typed and it is pretty good for the dirt cheap price.This is a hidden gem on Steam, maybe not the best and most valuable gem, but it is still definitely a gem that is unfarely underestimated and stereotyped.8/10 Not enough water."

""THEN HOW ABOUT WE MAKEA CHEAP KNOCKOFF OF IT FOR CONSOLES, TIM?"" ""OR BETTER YET,BOB, RIGHT BEFORE IT RELEASES ON CONSOLES?!"" ""GREAT IDEA TIM! YOU'VE EARNED A PROMOTION""So...after that, heres my opinion.Castleminer Z was a originally a console game, before being ported to PC. I have played it on consoles, and it hasn't changed much between ports.It was apparently released the same time as the Minecraft console ports, which makes it worse.The game in itself is enjoyable, to an extent.It hasn't got NEARLY as much secrets or variety as the thing it's knocking off.And even though I'm not really bothered by graphics, for a 2011 game (same year as skyrim released) IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD RUN ON WINDOWS 98.Pretty sure the enemies would suit an N64 game. But I'm also pretty sure the zombie model has been used in other games, so this game most likey uses Unity Engine assets.They even made a verson called CastleMiner that's just creative. They probably made the 2 versions to make more money from you buying them, though CastleMiner doesn't seem to be on steam...hmmm.I give the game:  1 kick in the nuts followed by watching your entire family being tortured to death while on fire/10P.S: the current price of under £1 seems too high for a piece of sh*t like this, it's worth about a penny."

The aim of the game is simple: mine resources, explore, survive, and build.Theres several settings and gamemodes you can play for this.settings:easy=enemies only spawn at night, deal less damage, and dont damage structuresnormal=enemies spawn frequently, deal more damage, and damage structureshard=normal mode but harder, and you drop all items on deathno enemies=no enemies spawn, but can still be force spawned.gamemodes:survival=classic survival, farm resources and fight enemies. You can save your worlds or progress hereendurance=survive as long as you can. You cannot choose the difficulty (it is set to normal i think) and you cannot save progress. Simply put its the only way to get most achievementscreative=gain unlimited resources, a building gamemode parallel to minecraft's creative modedragon endurance=only unlockable by killing the hell dragon in endurance mode, same as endurance but dragons spawn more frequentlyscavanger=more loot blocks appear that can be mined and drop loot ranging from resources to weapons.??? (forgot the name of the last one, sorry i'll look it up and change it later)=basically once you mine something, you gain infinte blocks to place from it.theres several enemies, ranging from zombies, to skeletons, aliens, dragons, and hell creatures as well as satan himself.it's pretty fun with friends, but alone it really is more dull and boring.

Then this is your game. and for only $2 as well so if you want something to do then here you go but don't expect any updates its been a year since the last update.Update of the review.So recently, this game was updated with some new features, the newest one is monster spawn blocks that spawn a bunch a enemies for rewards. Sounds kinda cool, but are basically pointless because: A. They're hard to find in normal modes. B. The loot is easily obtainable from different means like mining or even finding from an abandoned house in a random person's world. C. They're basically suicide when doing it alone and not geared up enough if you're a new player. Now there has been some good updates like a second hotbar to keep more important items in, teleporters, loot blocks and even windows. (Took them long enough for windows. XD) Although I'm going keep my orginal recommendation of this game as No, for there hasn't been an update that has blown my mind or got me hyped a lot.

Below is pretty much my gripes with the game.1) My gun fully disappeared, literally all of my items and enemies became completely invisible when I started.2) Is it just me or is it ALWAYS night time in castle miner?3) It is near impossible to get down a 1x1 hole due to the game's auto-climb feature.4) The crafting system is down-right odd. Usually you craft some tools for basic survival, but in Castle Miner Z you start with nothing, build a pickaxe, straight to a machine gun and then something that definitely is not a lightsabre.5) The idea of building is almost completely pointless because of the sheer amount of stuff that can destroy it, even your basic zombies destroy layers of materials to get into your base.6) Should the zombies get in, running away isn't a viable option because every type of screaming enemy is considerably faster than you are.7) Staying and fighting also isn't much of an option either, since it only takes about four hits to be killed.Just buy and mod minecraft like a sane person."

From its beautiful graphics to its addicting gameplay this game takes your breath away every step you take. If you love minecraft, counterstrike, Call of Duty Zombies, and ingesting lots of hallucinogens, this game is a must buy on any platform. The mele combat has to be the best I have ever seen in a videogame to date. The gunplay overtakes such games such as Battlefield or Call of Duty. The weapon choices are some of the most creative and most varied selection in videogame history. The game: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a clear rip off of Castle Miner Z's dragon combat, using wit and superior battleskills to take down the mighty dragons. Dragons come in many forms, which provides a nice change of pace, because we all know how boring yelling at a dragon is!  For an extreme deal of $4.99, this product is way to underpriced for its overall gameplay value. If you want to take this experience to the next level try using a gamepad or just simply play it on the Xbox 360! But wait! There is more! Did i mention you can play with any of your friends. No more hastle of making a minecraft server! You can even teleport to your friends without even typing in a single word! This stellar online experience far exceeds the multiplayer immersion of major multiplayer games like World of Warcraft. If you do not have this game, are missing out on a true experience that will change the course of history as we know it! An easy 10/10"

You start with 100% health, which regenerates quickly after a minor delay. The first enemy you encounter can kill you in two hits. There is no armor to craft, so unless you kill the enemy attacking you or run away from it, you're dead after that first hit.2. The final boss of Endurance mode, a big stupid dragon, comes out of nowhere on the surface whenever the hell it so chooses - in my case, it was before I had even upgraded my pickaxe.3. There is no sound when hitting enemies.4. Upon death, all of your inventory is gone. There is no option to retrieve what you've lost.5. Certain items require ridiculous amounts of resources to craft.6. The ""Hell"" stage (ripoff from Minecraft, as with everything else) doesn't require digging down far at all.Was it worth a dollar? I guess so. Would I recommend that you, or anyone else, spend that dollar? No. If this game were in Early Access, I'd completely understand its unpolished state.

,Not Recommended,253430,10470934,"Posted: 14 June, 2014",all,Gipo,"For the a while after I got this game I actually did enjoy it. Though the game's world does kind of rip-off Minecraft (and don't say this came before, Minecraft was late in beta and at the height of its popularity), the gameplay in it is quite a bit different than Minecraft. Basically, the objective of this game is to craft weapons and mine resources, while trying to get further away from the spawn, which will bring the player to new biomes with stronger enemies and better materials. Eventually you will run into the game's boss in the final biome. There is also somewhat of an objective to stay alive for as long as possible.The main thing to keep in mind though, is that this game really isn't geared to building much; it takes a long time to mine anything, and the further out you are the stronger the materials you will need, so the best thing you can build is a small bunker. Also, I find that this game does not expand much on survival; most of the game is trying to get as far as you can killing a few zombies that get in your way, though night-time can be dangerous, the game doesn't provide much in the way of ""surviving"" the zombie horde.To be entirely honest, in the end, I do not recommend this game. Though I did originally enjoy this game it unfortunately does not have much replay value or staying power, and the gameplay is kind of shallow. Of course, on the other hand I haven't played anything quite like this game, and I do think, that though shallow, the gameplay is unique. If it looks interesting, and if you're more of a casual gamer, don't be afraid to try it, just don't expect much replayability."

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings."

My opionion as a gamer for over 25 years is there should always be quest set in  ending the darkness that has fallen upon the land would be cool, like dungeons and dragon eggs to destroy to wipe out the dragons and huge underground grave yard undead lairs with a undead king and a hidden item that was the cause of this pelage of darkness such as a meteorite that has fallen many years ago so the land has over grown and it is hidden way deep and very heard to fine, and some type of heated stone that cause your regular iron pieks unable to dig through.

Here we have NounNoun- and there's not even a space between the two words! It also suffers from ""title is non-indicative of game content, better tack on a Z to show it has zombies.""As for the game itself? It's utter garbage. I can appreciate that it still took them time to make, but to go and sell this for $5 is a horrible error in judgement, and should be observed as such. ""Oh but Law, you haven't even played it for more than an hour!"" You're damn right I didn't. I played it for 8 minutes I think, and it's no hyperbole when I say that's all it took to see all the game had to offer. To be fair, 5 of those 8 minutes I spent in the pause menu, because I got up to make a sandwich.0/10 It wasn't even a good sandwich and I had to make a deal with the Devil to get my 8 minutes back."

,Not Recommended,253430,10144561,"Posted: 16 May, 2014",all,DRSLlives,"This game has potential, and I see what the producers are trying to do as far as horror survival goes. But this game needs more variety of items and weapons STAT! Not only that, I happen to have a laundry list of things they need to add:- A better communication system: I like the fact that you could type to your teammates. Which is a step in the right direction for a lack of a better term. But please consider voice chat because it's faster to give information to player and piers around you.- Sound effects: I would prefer this game to not recycle the same sound effects over and over. Especially the walking sound effect. I'm sorry but the last time I walked on grass, and snow I would never hear my foot tap. It's not that difficult either, just get a boom microphone and gather yourself or a team to go out and record sounds in the real world and import them in your game.-Weapons Variety: Add more guns, and melee weapons. I'm sorry but I don't want just simply cliched weapons that are popular to use. Try to add more modern weapons that would be used in warfare. I suggest looking at GTA V or Call of Duty as a source considering that the games has a variety of weapons that you could look at. So you could study them and recreate them in whatever videogame program you use, and import them in your game.- Too dark in Hell: I understand it's supposed to make Hell scary and makes the player more unwilling to go. But at least light it up a little bit because I just simply can't stand planting a torch everytime I walk through Hell. Not only that, enemies are rampet in Hell, so how the heck am I supposed to walk through the biome if I can't see the enemies?- Enemy Variety: Okay you have so far Skeletons, Dragons, Aliens, Demons, and Zombies. I could count all those enemies on the tip of my 5 fingers right now. Therefore this shows that you need more enemies. If I would suggest anything I say:*Blood thursty wolves(Non-tameable)*Dinosaurs(Like the T-rex, or veloceraptors)*Bats in the caves*Big Spiders*Alien Demon(AKA an Alien boss)*Snakes that attack(Mostly in sandy tarrain)*Evil NCPs we can combat against(Bandits, Burgulars, Intruders, pirates)Boom right there spick and span a list of enemies! You could litterally use anything in a game like this. Usually relevance doesn't really matter in vlox games because obviously we need to be able to have a variety of creatures to fight.- Make the players customizable already!: Honestly during the development of 1.7, you guys should've created those cusomizable characters by now. I'm sorry but, either make them customizable, or give us armor.- Make the players feel more rewarding: Okay grant it, you have the achievements in the game. Though, I would also prefer there to be an experience system within the game itself. Doing this will actually get other players and I to keep playing. Not only that, have a system where you could upgrade your stamina, health, reload speed, etc..-  Have villages, town, cities: There's nothing more boring than just walking through tarrien of empty forests, sandy grounds, and icy mountains. So I would suggest having civilization somewhere in the game. Probably have an abandon town, or something like that. Or at least villages with items and resources you could collect and explore from._________________________________________________________________________________Like I said this game has potential, but there's still some work that needs to be done. 1.7 may have boosted your game visually, but not morale and that urge of players wanting to keep playing is becoming really low. I've played this game since its release on the Xbox 360 in 2011. I thought it was a really fun game at the time, including the 1.5-1.6 updates that I looked forward to those updates in the past. But now the game is starting to suck because we've played through the same kind of thing over and over. That's because there's little no variety, no customization, and little to no fan requested content.Here's the reason why you're still getting bad reviews. It's not getting bad reviews because of the look of the game (Sure that would be the case of picky people who want visually compelling graphics) it's because the suggestion that people give you to make the game even better are practecly being IGNORED.I actually saw little to no changes based on what your fanbase requested you to add to make your game better. Please just enable modding so that the people in this community and who support your game could make it entertaining for everyone else. So you wouldn't have to worry about updating your game every couple months.Would've I give it a, ""Yes"" if the game was more geared towards a friendly fanbase system. Yeah I would.But sadly I'm giving this a thumbs down. DNA I like the stuff you make, and I'm sorrry. But either listen to your community, or just simply dictate your game however you please and leave out the things that the fans requested you to do. Overall it's your choice, your game, and your call.And that is all that needs to be said... And I'm simply done here people."

First, this game doesn't feel very unique with the enemies. The gun physcics feel cheap and like it was a mod for another game. Yes btw I've beaten endurance. I know the """"""""""""""""full expierience"""""""""""""""""""""" And I still do not recommend this game. Physics feel way to cheap and the game is abandoned pretty much likely to Castleminer Warfare. Also the effects are extremely cheap and I do not believe this was made off of really any money. All the effects are free including music or modified off of other games. Also I don't want to get started with the port. Its locked at 1080P and graphics aren't very good even at max settings and I cap 60 which is the limit to this game. Save up the money this game costs for a game like Minecraft this game was a buying point for (Back on Xbox 360 before Minecraft came out there) Please do not buy this. The devs don't put enough effort in. No updates. Little feedback. And don't buy Castleminer Warfare it looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥and likely is just a mod off of CastleminerZ once again. To get more money."

It's then your job to survive, while also collecting resources to build yourself a shelter and more weapons.  In my opinion, the UI is still ugly, and crafting isn't really that intuitive, it's built around hovering over buttons to reveal more options and buttons you can hover over to see more options.One thing I didn't like is that a zombie can literally spawn on top of you and start screeching.  It's 2:30am and that scared the **** out of me.Anyway.  I won't refund this, I'll keep it in my game library to see where the devs take it.If any of what I've said sounds good to you, why not try it, it's only $1, you don't really have a whole lot to lose. :P"

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face ofthe waters.¶ And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the lightfrom the darkness.And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.And the evening and the morning were the first day.¶ And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of thewaters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which wereunder the firmament from the waters which were above thefirmament: and it was so.And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and themorning were the second day.¶ And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gatheredtogether unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together ofthe waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yieldingseed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is initself, upon the earth: and it was so.And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after hiskind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after hiskind: and God saw that it was good.And the evening and the morning were the third day.123456789101112136 Genesis 1¶ And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavento divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and forseasons, and for days, and years:and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to givelight upon the earth: and it was so.And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give lightupon the earth,and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the lightfrom the darkness: and God saw that it was good.And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.¶ And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the movingcreature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in theopen firmament of heaven.And God created great whales, and every living creature thatmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after theirkind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it wasgood.And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fillthe waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.¶ And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature afterhis kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after hiskind: and it was so.And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle aftertheir kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after hiskind: and God saw that it was good.¶ And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over thefowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and overevery creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.So God created man in his own image, in the image of God createdhe him; male and female created he them.14151617181920212223242526277 Genesis 2And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, andmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and havedominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, andover every living thing that moveth upon the earth.And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the whichis the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and toevery thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I havegiven every green herb for meat: and it was so.And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it wasvery good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host ofthem.And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he hadmade.And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that init he had rested from all his work which God created and made.Man in the Garden of Eden¶ These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth whenthey were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earthand the heavens,and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and everyherb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused itto rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the wholeface of the ground.282930311234568 Genesis 2And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, andbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became aliving soul.And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and therehe put the man whom he had formed.And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree thatis pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in themidst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.¶ And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and fromthence it was parted, and became into four heads.The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth thewhole land of Havilah, where there is gold;and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyxstone.And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it thatcompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goethtoward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.¶ And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden ofEden to dress it and to keep it.And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree ofthe garden thou mayest freely eat:but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eatof it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.¶ And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should bealone; I will make him a help meet for him.And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of thefield, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to seewhat he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every livingcreature, that was the name thereof.And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, andto every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helpmeet for him.78910111213141516171819209 Genesis 3And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and heslept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh insteadthereof.And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he awoman, and brought her unto the man.And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of myflesh: she shall be called Woman [heb.

It's great fun to play with friends, it's basically but not exactly like Minecraft, with a hint of an Endless Wave survival of enemies. Which mainly include Zombies, Skeletons, and Dragons. (Yes, I know this also sounds vaguely familiar, but hear me out.) You're not going through this world with dinky little swords and bows. You get GUNS, bro! Rifles, Assult Rifle, Pistols, Shotguns, SMGs, and much more as you battle to survive or just get your resources to make a shelter. It's quite a fun experience, though it'll take some time getting used to as your tools can break while you're using them on trees, and rocks, and so. So most likely you're going to need to carry spares of that pickaxe before you try and mine that ore. But that's just a minor setback for all of the fun experiences to be had! Great game, great creators that listen to suggestions! Overall fun game. (Note: You're obviously going to need a slightly higher end pc to get some decent graphics or framerates.)"

I had bought it on the Xbox with a few of my friends before Minecraft: 360 Edition came out, and I honestly spent hours and hours in this game. This is a type of time wasting game that I quite enjoy, and since I bought it when it was on sale, I didn't have to spend much to get a few hours of memories back. All of the players I have met so far online have been very friendly and cooperative. What made this game so special on the 360, is that it used your avatar in place as your character. The soldier characters are kind of wierd, but I don't mind them much. There are many things I actually really, really like about Castleminer Z. The variety of weapons, actually having to make bullet casings and then bullets, the biomes (especially when you start to get out at least 5k blocks), the dragons (May be hard to kill at first, but craft an LMG, makes it a lot easier, and loot is generally worth it), and that there is a Hell. That is found really interesting, seeing that not other games are like that at all. Sure the game may not be for a lot of people or what a lot of people expect, but it still has many positive atributes. I bought this game mainly to complete all the achievements, and I will play the game even after I have finished doing that."

This is easily one of my top 10 games I have ever played. Why you ask? Well let me explain it to you.Castleminer Z is a game where you collect resources, craft weapons, and fight hordes of zombies, spooky skeletons, dragons, aliens, and even Satan himself. Not only can you fight, but you can also build forts, and travel vast distances that will can make your friends wonder why you play this game so much.

I could recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Minecraft and likes survival zombie games. $5 is a good price point for this product, and a sale rolls around every now and then. If you can, get some friends to pick up the game or buy a four pack to play together.

And also, I agree that the world feels kinda empty; events arent varrying enough quite yet even after a little playthroughBut, I've read on the steam forums for this game a post concerning the need for updating, considering the game's current instance. The OP asked, ""Will there be additional updates?"" followed by the sub-statement, ""they are still updating and fixing this game right?"".Then the dev responds, ""Yes, we are still working on the game."" Very (hopefully) relieving words, as this game has a lot of potential. Hardly anyone is a stranger to the zombie interjection taking up gaming as of late, but a voxel based zombie game sounds interesting enough. And it's nice to see some level of competition against the (personally) overpriced 7 Days to Die™ (in it's current state). But all of those things aside,4. It does control smoothly5. Crafting system is adequate and carries itself so-so6. Exploration is actually interesting (to me)7. I have not noticed any graphical issues on high (yet)It seems that somewhere, while checking into the game deciding whether to buy it or not, I had read a response from the developer that they intend to close the gap on issues such as missing chat features and such. Another poster in the forum that I originally mentioned had the great idea of opening this game up to the Steam Workshop, an idea I believe will be a saving grace for the game's replayablity, just like all games that go that route.In short, it does need work...but I personally sense potential in this game, and since the devs say it is work in progress, I think it will be a worthwhile purchase, especially if you love voxel games and/or zombie games.:::::::ONE DEFINITE THING TO MENTION TO THE DEV/DEVS:::::::If this is in a beta-form, like I have read in various (cant remember where at the moment) then it would be most helpful to mention this in the 'store page' of the game.

It would be nice to see a Teleport to home or be able to set a waypoint to Teleport to it. (as I have lost many houses on the 360 version) there is a lot of potential for this game though, like maybe adding character customization, maybe adding armor (Like maybe power armor made from Space Goo and Diamonds). I give this game a 10/10 and suggest it to those of you who want something a bit different from minecraft. I even gifted this to my friend for his Birthday and he said he liked it too."

In the fullest of time, however, the game is now on par with it's original price, and has been through signifigant changeThe game revolves around the general Minecraft gameplay formula, but encourges the traveling of far distances whilst fighting off howling and shrieking zombies, bow wielding skeletons, demons and frequent dragons (which become increasingly deadly as you progress). The player can build a variety of firearms to combat the above threats, which alone is what made this game different from other clones of Minecraft at the time. but enough rambling, you all want the goods and bads of this title, don't ya?Good qualities (with recent updates):.runs smoothly on most computers.the new textures really improve the dark atmosphere.cinematic music plays at certain distances, becoming increasingly epic as you progress. the new loot blocks really help with progression and make the once harsh road to hell itself easierGeneral dislikes (there's nothing I hate about this game):.You only need to make an assault rifle out of all the guns to do well..enemy AI can be overwhelming and infuriating.the player model is rather generic, even with the change of colors (on Xbox, you used your avatar).the hud is a little strangely arranged.gets boring kinda quicklyoverall, this game is pretty good. It's not perfect, and could genuinely use some improvements down the line, but I recommend it if you want a little variety in ""voxel survival."""

So make copper walls from raw minerals and ect...Zombies start spawning like crazy after a few in-game days, the further out you go the bigger the numbers of them that spawn which will make sense but become overwhelming after awhile, zombies jumps get unreal when walking up a hill, they jump really high and they get behind you so you go to turn and they've jumped over you a few times.Zombies kill in 2-3 hits.Skeletons can hit you from a very long range with their bow.Dragons almost attack you from the first minute of playing until you run and hide for a x-amount of time or until they despawn or get killed.Enemies spawn in a completely lit up area regardless of how many torches or laterns placed.Helpful hints:Never go out alone, always go with a partner, carry guns & ammo & tools on your 8 slot inventory line so you dont lose them upon death.Place Respawn Becons when out farther than a few hundred blocks if you intend to setup a home/base or want to mine.Keep a inventory box on hand alot.Build a sky bridge 10-20 blocks from surface so you dont get mobbed by tons of enemies on the ground.If not for the OP zombies and constant spawning of enemies in lit up area's I'd rate this game higher but lots of fun can be found in it. I score this game 6/10"

The world consists of your starting area, floating islands, deserts, mountains, antarctica, layer 7-12 from minecraft and then hell. They keep repeating and it can eventually get a bit dull, another issue regarding this is that the block's collision detection begins to mess up, the player can start walking through blocks for a certain time.Endurance mode is probably my favourite, but due to a lack of content, variety and rather slow update frequency it can get rather dull.So, my verdict would probably be a 7/10.Competent game, but needs polishing and a bit more variety."

The game had a few bugs here and there, so I stopped playing.A few months later I came back to the game (After the 1.7 update) and found it to be quite enjoyable! It's now at a balanced staged between fun and challenging! A lot of the bugs that were in the game before are now fixed and the game runs quite smoothly.The online is still really clunky and laggy and full of bugs, but playing with friends is a great time.I'm very very pleased with this game, I got it for like $2.19 a while ago, but it's worth every cent!"

Some will say that the guns take away a certain aspect of the creativity and niche that Minecraft had, and that is true. The guns do kind of ruin it in a way. Its also a bit more dark and horror- ish than minecraft, and most of that is due to the soundtrack. Its creepy at first, but is rather short, meaning you'll hear the same screams over and over and over again until you get sick of em.  But besides that, its just like Minecraft in every other aspect.All that being said, I still liked it. Minecraft was too squeeky clean and innocent for me, and this seems to be a good compromise. The game more centers on the survival aspect of Minecraft than it does the creativity, which suits me just fine. its a fun game to paly with friends during a big lan party, and at the price I paid, Id say I definitly got my moneys worth.8/10 -would buy again"

Castleminer Z is incredibly similar to survival games such as Minecraft, but provides less creative freedom. Rather than building fantastic creations, you must take into consideration your own survival. I first experienced this game years back on the Xbox 360. I had plenty of fun with it then, but the game has been improved since that time. During your first experience, the journey to endgame may take a little over 12 hours. This alone makes the $4 well spent. However, if you decide to pay the $8 for the 4-pack, you can easily put in around 20+ hours messing around with friends in all of the different gamemodes and difficulty settings. For its price, this game is fantastic. I do highly recommend that you play with friends. Otherwise, the game becomes substantially more difficult and may become stale quite quickly."

Blowing mountains, digging through hell, fighting Satan, kill a bunch of aliens. You can do that, just like the other sandbox games.However, unlike the Minecraft and Terraria or some other sandboxs, you can't take this game as a building game, because there's no furniture. Yes, I said that, there's no furniture in this game. This, is the main downside of this game. And the blocks ain't that varies either. You can build a big mansion, yes, but only with total same blocks and without any tables nor chairs, only doors and torches. Oh, and there's no water.It basically take the fun out of the game real quick, for there's only few things to do. So if you wanted to buy and play this game, make sure it's on a sale, and there's a couple of friends. Play with them, that's where the fun is."

This game not only has the general fun, pvp, and free-sandbox style of feel to it, but it adds a 'defensive' sense to it, whereas you are not safe during the day or at any time really. I've played this game for countless hours on my Xbox 360 and now have purchased it on Steam, so this review encompasses both games. This game adds the sense to a mining-sandbox game like no other in the concept that there are constantly hostiles (zombies, skeletons, and even flying dragons!). You must always be on the lookout for monsters outside of your fortification, and more often than not, be cautious inside as well! At first I figured this game would be cheap in quality in comparison to the price, however it clearly surpasses the price in quality. There are many weapons to choose from and different qualities. The main flaw I have with this game is that there aren't many 'creative' items to build. Besides your standard tools, you can only build doors, torches, and walls. I would like to see more items, however this is still worth the $1.99!Pros--Sandbox game-Mining game-Always monsters-Adds a 'defensive' spin to the game (always makes me feel as though I need to construct an elaborate bunker)-Cheap in price ($1.99 is definitely worth it, I'd be willing to pay up to $15-20 for it)-Automatic climbing (you don't have to spacebar every block, you can actually just move forward and move up blocks)Cons--Would like to see some feature to increase the sunshine when in daylight, always cloudy to some annoyance-Not meant for creative minds, very few blocks to build with other than walls-Seems to be a game you play at first for a few hours, stop and forget for a few days, then remember and play again"

,Recommended,253430,34028489,Posted: 4 August,all,Vulpas Inculta,"This game is a very nostalgic experience for me. As I played it the week of its release on xbox and continued playing it for years after. Now the game has updated a lot sense then and its ui is a lot better. The developer does continue work (I think) on the game. The reason you see most people hating on this game is because they think it is a minecraft copy and don't bother going but 10 minutes under the shell. While the game does lack in certain areas, like decoration. It is fun. Very fun with friends too. The game is kind of shallow but the textures are not bad for a game made by one person and it is surprisingly stable. With that being said there is a game breaking bug that needs to be fixed. To unlock one of the gamemodes called dragon endurance you need to complete the mode endurance first.. The special thing about endurance is that it is the only way to unlock achievements and you can't save. If you leave you leave. The world is gone. But I found that playing for about 2 hours with friends results in an error. A memory error. Now this isn't a problem with my ram because many other people have this error too. I feel this could be patched easily. Now I said this earlier but many people think this is a minecraft clone. The thing is castleminer Z was made before minecraft therefor not making it a clone. Many people don't think to look 10 minutes passed it because they think ""this is another one of those minecraft rip offs trying to take a shot for the money"" When they really just have to play the game. The game also gives off this wierd dark vibe. Whether it be the shiny bright moon (which is really pretty) at night or the ominous thunderstorm constantly in the back, or the alien shrieks you hear at the meteorite sites. I would definitely recommend this game because it has managed to give me 50 + hours on pc and maybe over 1000 on xbox."

The problem is it was better on the Xbox about 5 years ago than it is now. The sensetivity is just bad and It is glitchy as hell. I know it is a very old game but I wouldn't buy it. Just my opinion.

I remembered this game as a perfect blend of Minecraft's building and adventure, and the gunplay of Battlefield or Call of Duty, which were some of my favourite games at the time (I was a normie, I know). So I bought it...This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awful, like, truely ♥♥♥♥ing awful. I have no idea how this piece of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥made its way off the indie xbox ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t market, but it did, oh boy, it did. However, I would be lying if I said I got no enjoyment out of it.

,Recommended,253430,35028650,Posted: 17 September,all,ThePoshGoat,"CastleMiner Z is not a good game, it is littered with bugs, inconsistencies and optimization problems, however it is very amusing game to play. There are multiple different modes that all offer a unique experience. The main strength of CastleMiner Z is its multiplayer, as most of the enjoyment comes from the funny moments this game provides when playing with friends, and the UI makes it easy to join with friends and random players via the home screen. I would recommend this game to anyone with friends to play it with, and a high tolerance for poor game design."
