You marines can only level up 4 times and this seriously puts them at a major disadvantage late game (especially on Normal and above)3) NG+ is not fleshed out. This connects to point 2, due to the limited levelling up and progression, the only reason to play NG+ is for a scaled challenge. Completed the game on Easy? NG+ is Easy 1.5 etc etc4) The game is meant to be played multiple times, but there is a slight lack in variey (especially in enemies)After completing a few runs, Ive seen enough. There are better games out there"
76561198006208917,Not Recommended,253630,13937356,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Cathol,"When I think rogue-like, I think of a good, challenging (sometimes brutal), game that I can play in a couple of hours. I think of ascending difficulty where I try to find better gear and become more powerful so that I can attempt to defeat ever more challenging enemies until they kill me, or I manage to beat the end objective. Completing the game should be a proud moment that makes me want to brag to my friends that I finally accomplished it.Sadly, Steam Marines fails to achieve most of this. The basic game mechanics aren't bad, and the first couple of levels were fun, but it gets sorely repetitive very quickly. Each area introduces new enemies, but they all do pretty much the same thing (except the bosses, but even they only have a minor twist to make them unique).  On the rare occasions when you find new weapons and armor, odds are your marines can't use it, or it will be worse than what you already have. Once you figure out how to beat the enemies, the game becomes very formulaic and more of a chore to trudge through each level. At normal difficulty, each level took about 30 minutes (that number can vary a lot). With 25 levels, it just takes way too long for a rogue-like.When I beat the game, I wasn't jumping for joy. Rather, I felt myself saying ""finally, it's done."" I decided to raise the difficulty to see if it got better. The enemies were tougher and more numerous, but still did the same thing. The levels just took longer and longer to beat and felt more like a crawl. After a couple of levels, I decided I had better things to do than wait a minute or two between every turn while the computer made its move.UPDATE: Changing the AI speed did help speed up the computer's turn significantly, but wasn't enough to reduce the tedium enough for me to want to play this game again. I got through a couple more levels and decided I'd rather spend my time playing something else. I do appreciate that the developers are still working on the game, so hopefully they'll be able to add enough variety to make me want to play it again."
,Not Recommended,253630,32856632,Posted: 27 June,all,firelynx,"All good fun until you find all the bugs. The bugs your marines are not able to handle, the bugs in the code that is.This is a rogue like and it takes time to get to the point where you find a better weapon. Most weapons you find are worse than the one you already have, and you only find a weapon every 4th game or so.When you have two marines with the same class they can use the same weapon, but only the first one can switch their weapon to the one they found.Same goes for armor.Weapons and armor pretty much sums up the real powerups you can get, so there you go.The actual game mechanics are centered around counting tiles your enemy's will move next turn, staying out of their way and guarding to shoot them when they advance. Grenades are worthless until you get level ups and the only weapon that does not just do damage is the shotgun, which is one of the best things about this game. It does knockback and you can push robots off the ship through the walls.The map generation is totally broken. The maps do not look like anything any human would design as a spaceship. Some rooms do not even have a door, you have to break through the walls.In the end, I payed 5 bucks for the game and it's worth 5 bucks. Just don't expect a fully functional game."
,Recommended,253630,7524960,"Posted: 30 October, 2013",all,Joeru,"Steam Marines is a brutal tactical turn based squad based sci-fi roguelike. It is reminiscant of games such as Dungeons of Dredmore and Sword of the Stars: The Pit mixed up with the AP and Squad systems of X-Com.The game currently offers 4 classes; Leader, Scout, Grenadier and Support which offer a variety of different play styles. This game does have a steep learning curve and like all roguelikes it is a very frustrating but rewarding experience.If you enjoy roguelikes and tactical squad based games then this title is definitely for you, otherwise you may end up putting your fist through the monitor in sheer frustration."
,Not Recommended,253630,15168411,"Posted: 2 April, 2015",all,fab,"Summary: The interface / control scheme in this game is in dire need of some polishing / streamlining. There are so many other amazing roguelikes out there that I just can't be bothered. Heck, there's even a straight up Space Hulk game on Steam which may be less terrible, so if you're craving the derelict spaceship atmosphere of the beloved board game, maybe that's worth a shot instead?__________________________________After a brief glance at the development logs, I have my doubts as to whether or not the developer will produce that any time soon. The game was in early access for at least a year, and I made a point of not playing it til after it was officially released since my backlog is already ridiculous as is. (I think I got it on a steep discount or as part of a Humble Bundle.)In my admittedly brief time with the game, I found a number of irritations:- Long (non adjustable?) delay after your squad members run out of action points before it switches to the next squad member. (Weirdly enough, you can adjust the enemy AI delay re: the length of time for their actions. It's a small quirk, but I knew if I played for awhile, nitpicks like this would drive me nuts.)- Needs easier access to contextual info. It would be nice if I could just hover the mouse cursor over a tile to get more information. I don't think left click to focus does the trick, but I honestly can't remember.- Enemies telegraph their location during their phase. (I was playing on Easy to try to learn the mechanics / interface, so I'm not sure if this applies to higher difficulties.)I found myself wishing it had a user interface closer to something like Dungeons of Dredmor, which had excellent visual feedback and mouse support. Maybe the devs have to work around limitations of the Torque engine that they used to develop Steam Marines. Either way, there are better roguelikes to spend your time and money on.There may be a fantastic game in here somewhere, but I doubt I'll put more than a couple hours into it out of morbid curiousity. Maybe I'm a masochist, but I find it interesting to see how badly a UI / mechanic can be implemented, which makes me appreciate all those little things I usually take for granted in other better games!As it stands, I can't recommend it at anywhere near full price. The regular price on Steam is absurd, as I wouldn't pay more than $3 - 5 max and can't see it being worth more than a tenner if it ever gets proper UI updates. :("
,Not Recommended,253630,9680674,"Posted: 30 March, 2014",all,PhDashing,"Steam Marines will definitely appeal to a small subset of people, but not to a general gamer audience and certainly not to me (and I love roguelikes!).To not die within the first couple of floors of Steam Marine, you must play extremely cautiously. Open a door; set up the rest of the squad to guard behind. Look around the room; set up the rest of the squad to guard. If there are enemies, kite backwards while setting the rest of the squad to guard and maybe get some pot shots in. Failure to do any of these things risks the chance of some ranged bot popping out the shadows and taking a marine from full health to dead/near dead in a single turn. You have a rough idea of where enemies are from hearing their footsteps, but you have no idea how the rooms and doors are connected until you actually pop your head in and turn about.The marine health/enemy damage ratio is so very low, so there is no room for error. Trying to run and gun, or even advance to a forward position and burst an enemy down, will get you killed very fast.This demanded precision is frustrated by the control scheme: every  of the many actions has a mapped key, with NO context sensitivity. While I'm used to games like this, the learning curve is still a little steep, and the memorization will be a turn-off for many people. This frustration is compounded by the fact that there is no undo, even for benign actions with no impact on the immediate turn, such as guarding. Did you just hit the wrong key at a critical turn and accidentally fire at nothing, or guard into a wall, or use an item you didn’t intend to, etc.? All your hours and effort is wasted now, your run is over.If a repetitive, boring, and cautious slog through a hardcore dungeon where small mistakes will waste hours of work sounds exciting to you, this game is for you. Again, I’m sure there are some people who will enjoy such a neurotic challenge, but this experience is not for most."

The result is an at times funny, challenging, thrilling and re-playable team-based tactics game that is perfect for short gaming sessions."

Your team-members will gain experience and new items in their travels, gradually growing more powerful to take on more dangerous enemies.The combat system is simple and easy to get into. Your team and their enemies cannot target each other diagonally, making combat easy to plan and to execute. However, a single miscalculation from one character might end up costing the whole teams life. Learning from such mistakes, by dying, is part of the charm, as in other roguelikes.I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys fighting robot-aliens in space with simple tactics. The idea of traversing and exploring levels of a huge steampunk spaceship, under attack from unknown enemies, is certainly quite titillating."

Bionic costs half as much as this, and is actually a finished product.Steam Marines is a great concept that never got finished.  Many of the poor gameplay elements, admitted to by the Dev, were supposed to be changed before launch.  They were not.  Dev swore all over the place that he was going to maintain the game post-release, and not abandon it the day it came out.  That's exactly what he did, leaving TONS of game-breaking bugs and glitches.  There is no music, there is no variety, the tutorial in no way prepares you for the amount of missing information you'll find in the game.It's sad, because this really could have been a great game.  It is not.  It's a twenty dollar turd that you should avoid at all costs.  Dev skipped supporting this game to start working on a sequel instead, but that's a dangerous road.  How many people are going to buy another game from someone who just got bored with his first one and left it to rot?You can still see the 'road map' on the discussions page.  After playing the game for a while, then reading the road map, you realize that a vast amount of the features the dev decided to leave out are exactly the ones that needed to be implemented to make this a great title.  I have no idea what he was thinking, because he was well on his way to making one of the best games to come out of Greenlight/Early Access."

You sweep levels dispatching robots and aliens, and boss enemies that guard the exit to the areas at the end.The key aspect of this game is that you are leading a group of marines, from which each will have their own tactical uses. You'll have different weapons equipped and different abilities to use - each which will require specific positioning to make the most of.There are also a variety of areas to move around in too. Initially you'll be moving through the Command Deck which will feature basic Robot Enemies to fight off. After beating the Command Deck you'll be able to pick what area you wish to move onto.Of course, you are probably wondering where the unfavorable part of this review comes in, so let's get into that now...Difficulty levels don't seem to be balanced well for inexperienced or experienced players, RNG elements seem to be in places where they shouldn't be - like how much shops will sell stuff for or what they sell or in starting attributes of your marines.Progression is also a rather annoying aspect of this game. You start out in the Command Deck everytime you begin - but it will get sterile quite quickly. Areas feel a bit expansive and long, which is fine, but what isn't fine is that you are moving through 5 levels for each area. When moving through the levels, it is possible for you to spawn next to the elevator - and if it is the last level of an area, you will spawn next to the exit boss....There were also some general annoyances such as skill balance selection being extremely unbalanced - leaving to little choice in what you pick. I also found that the enemies can be somewhat unpredictable in some situations - which is not a good thing to have in Rogue-likes since it is part of the game to understand how enemies operate!Really this should be an enjoyable game, but its chief problem is that it feels like it hasn't been fleshed out enough. I haven't seen any re-visitation from the developer though, so I feel that this negative review is warranted."

The game is incredibly slow paced, you can only attack in 4 directions, and marines typically have very few action points which makes getting through each level really tedious.

The core of the game is about managing a team of 4 Marines are you move through a procedurally generated ship, combating a variety of enemies in turn based combat.  You clear the ship room by room, exercising the best tactics you can to conserve life and ammo so you can make it to the next floor.  There's an AP system in place, so on your turn, you move your squad around as far as your AP will let you, and then it's the enemy's turn, exhausting their AP, etc. so positioning and attention to detail is required to make sure you don't leave a Marine stranded in a bad positionI've never strayed past normal difficulty, but even there the game can be pretty unforgiving.  Death is permanent, and often swift.  Ammo is limited and so is inventory space, so you really need to scrounge carefully and decide on what to pack when you move between decks.  I've had games that were rougher than others, but never once did I feel as if the RNG was the sole thing that screwed me over- in most of my games, there was something better I could've done to avoid calamity.Despite being an early access title, I wholly recommend Steam Marines.

You can pick your classes for your team, but beyond that you have no control. Each member will have random stats and the weapon stats are random too.The enemies are not designed at all for the gameplay as some would require flanking but everything is too cluster-phobic or require too many AP to do it and because of the of the randomness you may or may not have a shield pricing or ignoring weapon that will do enough damage. Enemies also do ridiculous amounts of random damage, sometimes just scratching them or out right kill them in one hit so when you do flank it just places you in a worse position.The combat is made even more awful by the fact you can’t shoot on the diagonal which burns the already random number of points that are sometimes so low you can’t do anything with them and moving through your own marines consumes even more. Better hope your random weapon is useful because you might as well you harsh language. Punching has knock back but one square means nothing and you were better off blasting them instead of wasting a AP on each side. Your guys are generally so weak both offensively and defensively moving solo or away at any distance is going to get them killed.The level generation is just horrific. It’s far too tight, slapdash and at times require you to bust down walls just to get to the exit. Enemy placement is absurd at times leading to whole room stuffed wall to wall and you hoping they don’t have enough random AP to get to you. Then there are random events that just leave you ???. Moving through each level is a slow and painful process as moving at speed will get you killed. You constantly have to setup ambushes which slow you down to a crawl and even if you are safe the slower marines will drag you even further.The levelling system is barely a thing. You get new skills but most are not particularly useful and your stats don’t seem to increase. You don’t feel anymore powerful than before.Loot is almost non-existent as you mostly find the odd canteen or ammo mag or coins. When you do find a weapon again the stats are all over the place and you don’t really know if it is an improvement or that your marines can even use it.The UI is near unusable as you never really know who you gave the ammo to or understand what the stats are of how they interact. Everything is needlessly pixelated and small making it a chore to read. It’s all ugly to boot.It is just too random, badly designed, ugly, unbalanced and entirely unfair. This is a game that has seriously gone wrong at every level. Utterly unenjoyable and would have refunded it if I had the chance back then and demanded money for the waste of time."

Nice pixel-art style graphics and a well chosen score set the mood for this broody journey through a space ship taken over by killer robots! If you are looking for story it seems that's all you're getting, but the gameplay is so engrossing you'll forget that pretty quickly! Add in the fact that once your squad members die they're really gone for good and a wiped out squad means game over and it's really easy to get pulled into this game. Fiendish difficulty and a steep learning curve help to keep you forever on your toes whilst playing.As far as the early access goes it seems to be a fully functional game, with a lot of room for expansion. For example there are currently 4 possible squad member classes (that cover quite a range of skills), maybe half a dozen item drops (but the varied effects show that there could be many more yet to come), and from what I've seen a small selection of enemies with pretty basic AI. That said I think this Alpha will probably entertain me for at least a couple more hours (especially if the difficulty keeps ramping up as it has been). I imagine the beta and full release will have many hours of gameplay due to the procedurally generated levels and possible squad configurations and tactics.My only gripe so far is with the control scheme and UI which sometimes make it difficult to work out exactly where you're at (which squad member you're controlling, ammo, etc) and makes it all to easy to make costly mistakes. It would be nice to see some refinement in this over the next few builds as it slows you down in a game that is already requiring a lot of thought before each move.I would definitely recommend, especially at it's current low price, currently very good, only going to get better :)"

This is an amazing game, who will provide you with countless hours of fun, as long as you are ready for facing the complete unknown. The first thing to remember about this game is that you have to remember that a lot of it being fun is due to its ""old style"", ""retro style"", game, so don't expect things to come as easily as they come in modern games, where you can control everything just using your mouse ... this game requires you to really understand it and learn how to play it, and that means that the first times that you play you are probably going to loose, a lot! So, be ready to die, die, and die, as many times as it takes until you understand the gameplay. If the game doesn't look appealing in your first try, consider playing a few more times, since the easiness of dying can make you feel kinda blue when u are beginning. One of the key aspects of the game is memorizing what each class of soldier can do (leader, grenadier, etc.) and understand how to use them ... for instance, if you are not careful the grenadier will most likely get your other soldiers in a friendly fire ... also, you need to pay a lot of attention to how many moving points each soldier has, since a single mistake usually means death. What is fun about this game is that each scenario is completely random, so each start is almost like a fresh new start ... details, like paying attention to ammo, to doors that have bombs on them, or learning when is it worth to break down a wall to move to another room instead of using doors can mean the difference between life and death ... game rules as well must be well learned, since ""simple"" things like reloading means using all the action points available for that marine ... learning how to fire at enemies is also interesting, since you can only fire in straight lines (exception to the grenadier who can cause collateral damage around where his shells land), so it is almost like playing chess only with pawns and towers ... the guard mode can be pretty useful if you positioned your marine in the correct line of fire, or useless if he is looking to the left and the enemy is coming from the right ... and no, although in guarding mode, he won't turn and shoot the enemy ... in essence, I think this is a game where you spend the first hour learning ""how to play"" and counting how many times you already died ... however, after understanding the gameplay, it is fun, definitely! Due the random nature of the game you can find yourself suddenly surrounded by enemies or just exploring room after room and getting credits and more ammo ... what is going to happen? Nobody knows, each game is unique, and they are worth a shot ... however, if you are expecting an easy to play game, this is not a good idea ... it takes  time, strategy, memory and the ability to cope with defeat ... just like in real life!"

You are paying to playtest and report bugs/problems. In return, you get a copy of the game when it's released. I have given this game a thumbs up because I think it has potential, not because I think you should buy it. If you don't want to playtest a game in development, DON'T BUY THIS GAME.As I said, I think this game has potential But right now, the word is ""simplistic."" And in this context, that's a bad word.The gist is, you get a squad of four space marines of various classes, and you fight through several decks of a derelict space ship. Every turn, each marine gets a certain number of action points. Moving one square costs one action point, shooting costs one action point, turning 90 degrees costs one action point, reloading your weapon costs all your remaining action points.That gets very frustrating, very quickly, but I could live with it. what I CAN'T live with is the aiming mechanic. You can only fire at an enemy that is DIRECTLY in front of you. So if the enemy is four squares north and one square west, your first shot is going to cost three points (move one west, turn north, fire). Not only does that make the game difficult, but it also makes it very frustrating.That on top of the fact that realoading your weapon ends that marine's turn makes this game (for me) essentially unplayable in its current form. There are a lot of nifty ideas in this game, but for now that is preventing me from enjoying it.But take heart! This is a pre-release game, so it will be getting better. I can't say for sure that the things I don't like will get fixed, but I am optimistic that Steam Marines will be a fine game some day.EDIT:Just started playing this game again, and I'm enjoying it thoroughly. Reading my review above, I can't say that any of that has changed (though unchecking the option for ""facing costs AP"" was a big relief), but it seems that it matters less. Another problem that I had before was that it was hard to see. Once a marine looked away from a wall (for example), I seem to recall that there was no placeholder graphic to remind you ""hey! There was a wall here!"" Now walls don't disappear when you're not looking at them. I could be remembering wrong, but if that was a problem before it no longer is.This is now a game that I will whole-heartedly recommend."

In reality this is the difficulty of the game trying to force the player to have some ambition, to get into the feel of a roguelike where you trying to fight your way out of a dire situation. For example, in the earlier stages of the game there is some confusion as to whether you should take out the enemy robots or just run for the nearest elevator with minimal losses but no gained experience. At first this seemed like a design flaw, but after multiple playthroughs I'm of the opinion that the designers want an authentic roguelike experience, they don't want a corridor roguelike where you're just blasing through enemies to get to the randomized item at the end of the level. Thus I appreciate the game so far and need to put more time into it (that is the goal of an good indie game right?)."

,Recommended,253630,8355926,"Posted: 27 December, 2013",all,LandStander,"This is one game well worth the (cheap) price of Early Access.Loosely based on the Warhammer 40,000: Space Hulk board game, Steam Marines gives you 4 marines in a ruined steam-punk spaceship, tasked with reaching the elevator to the next level amid a swarm of angry robots.  The game works on a turn-based system with action points that players of XCOM will be very familiar with.  Once you've exhausted the action points on each marine, your turn ends, and all nearby robots get to spend their own action points to move or attack.Marines can move, attack, activate consoles, pick up loot (and believe me, you'll need a lot of it to survive), guard certain fire zones, or even bash down walls to create new paths.  Destructible environments make this a very dynamic game where you're never safe from the impending march of the machines.  Robots WILL come bursting out of the nearest wall when you're least expecting them - ruining your most careful positioning.  And positioning does matter quite a lot, particularly with some enemy types that are shielded from the front, forcing you to split your forces and flank.  Randomly generated levels provides endless replayability to perfect and level up your squad.I could go on about this game, but for how cheap it is, and much more is yet to come (it's only in alpha and already a blast to play), this is a no-brainer.

This game feels like playing a full fledged game and while if you look closely you can spot the rough edges, it generally doesn't affect gameplay. Even better than that though is the fact that the developer is constantly active with the community working to fix any issues that crop up and discussing future implementations. As a personal example, I reported a minor bug that I noticed. He responded within 3 hours saying not only had he found the problem, but he also fixed it. If every early access developer put this kind of effort in, it wouldn't be nearly the crapshoot it currently is when buying early access games. If you want proof of developer involvement just look at the forums for this game, he is constantly posting.On the play side of things, this is not a game that will appeal to everyone. You control a squad of four marines progressing through procedurally generated ""decks"" of a space ship. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics reminiscent of the XCOM series in that every unit has a limited number of ""action points"" to use for moving, attacking, healing, etc. Once you have used all of your points the computer takes its turn moving the enemies about in the same fashion. Each of your marines has a different class/weapons and it is up to you to use them in a way that utilizes their strengths. With the exception of a brief tutorial that introduces just enough of the mechanics to kill yourself, there is very little hand holding in this game. Let me be clear though, there is a big difference between accessible and dumbed down. This game is most certainly accessible and honestly, pretty intuitive; it is not at all dumbed down. It will not stop you from accidentally throwing a grenade right next to a teammate, wandering around dying because you went the wrong way, or even wasting your points on accidental actions. This game will never ask you ""are sure you want to (insert random action here)"".If this sounds boring in any way let me disabuse you of that right now. This game is incredibly intense in a on-the-edge-of-your-seat way. If you ever start to feel relaxed, it's probably because you are staring at the menu screen after getting your face melted by a robot. Turn based means you get as much time as you want to choose how to lead your marines to their death, it also means you have to sit and watch as the AI exploits your mistakes to bring said death about even faster. As you progress through the game your marines will earn experience that translates into more perks and better stats. You will find yourself becoming more attached to your marines the longer you survive, making it that much worse when they suffer perma-death. The reluctance to enter a new room or turn a corner is heightened by the fact that the game has only one save file that is constantly updated so there are no second chances. You can find survivors along the way but they will be lowly privates with none of the awesomeness of your fallen soldier. Unlike some procedurally generated games there is a definite (and achievable) end goal which is perfect for people like me who need something to work towards besides a general ""do good..."".If any of this has sounded interesting I would recommend getting this game. Whether or not it is worth the list price is something you will have to decide for yourself, for me it was. If nothing else, watch for the game to go on sale or try to win one of the free keys the developer offers on his sitewww.steammarines.com. Personally, I can't wait to see what this games becomes as it is developed further and until then I will continue to enjoy the current iteration."

The robots on the ship want you dead, and they are very good at it. You need to recognize each type of enemy and learn to deal with them. You can, with some luck, find equipment to help you out. But first and foremost, you need to keep your squad healthy. Learn how the enemies move, learn how to cut paths through the ship, and make sure to cover the entrances to the rooms you're in. It is a very bleak game. You're not gonna find health packs all over to heal your squad, but at the same time you are invested in them. There's multiple classes, each good for different roles, and together they mesh to make it survivable. Losing a squad member hurts, and you will be fighting to save a squadie if he gets cut off from the rest. I do wish that firing was more free line of sight, ala space hulk, but it's all tile based, which offers a different strategic element, though I find it works pretty well with the constricting corridors you often find yourself in. Playing the tutorial is a must. There's not a lot of clicking to be done, as most controls are done with the keyboard, and if you don't play the tutorial, you will not know what keys to use. I almost wish they had just completely removed the mouse from the controls. I think it just confuses people more than anything. Graphically, it's retro. My only real gripe is that I wish there were death animations and corpses left from your squad members instead of them just dissapearing. If you like roguelikes and you like tactical gameplay, and you don't mind (prefferably like) the retro presentation, it's a pretty fun game. I feel like there should be more depth to it, more classes offering more weaponry, etc, but it is what it is, and what it is is a pretty solid, cuthroat scifi roguelike with squad management.

Every little mistake you make means your death. There was no other game I have played that made me over think my every movement and regret so much some of my actions.Overall it is a carefully crafted turn base strategy tactical combat game. The mechanics are very interesting, once you get a grasp on them … usually after you first 100 deaths in level 1. The UI is slow to grasp, it took me many days till I finally get to understand that your Soldiers can level up and use skills. But once you got everything … it gets very interesting.Despite the brutal difficulty of the game, one cannot say it is unfair. The game stated that is difficult, so the deaths are caused by your decisions alone. On the contrary of what people think that this game is unbeatable … once you understand the way to play it, you are going to wreck those Aliens. You just need patience, a lot of smart thinking and repetition …. and luck … tons of luck.I suggest this game to any turn base fans over there."

For its price tag I would recommend getting it only when on sale if this is something you really want to try…The Good: You have classes all fairly unique, nice range of enemies, it’s tough with a steep learning curve but not impossible meaning you’ll want to try again once you get the hang of it, some nice little collectables.Not so good: Old school graphics, I don’t mind these but only when done correctly these actually cause headaches when trying to play the game (i.e. think two corridors are joined only to find out its outer space). Controls seem on occasion buggy can be a minor nuisance. Prices in shops fluctuate drastically it seems a little too random. Cover doesn’t seem to work very well mainly due to graphics and controls you think you’re in cover when not. It’s hard yes but to the point sometimes the enemies are harder than you and your facing more of them. Too random, some levels you breeze through no problems other times your get creamed by strange map design, and overpowered NPCs.Try Halfway it’s very similar but seems to have dropped the complete randomness for a better storyline and a much more enjoyable play. I would easily change this review if the above were fixed or the price was slightly less (worth it on sale)."

If you press into a wall, that actually takes an action point.  This is because you can break through pretty much any wall.  Changing your facing consumed an action point, which I consider an unforgivable flaw.  This is something I'm used to being ""free"" in all other TRPGs.There is no story at all.  There's nothing between each level.  It just jumps into the next level as soon as you finish one.  The goal in every level is to reach the elevator.  You don't have to kill all enemies.  The enemies are unbalanced.  I played at the easiest difficulty and I encountered several enemies that I couldn't cause ANY damage on.  That includes blasting it with my ""heavy"" and nearly killing himself with the splash damage.It felt like a random demo that someone made to show off their gameplay system.

You control a squad of four marines trapped on board a spaceship full of human killing robots all wanting to rip your squishy human squad into teeny tiny pieces.  The game is rouge like so each time you play the ship, enemy and loot layout is slightly different meaning nothing is predicable.When you start the game you select classes and perks for each of your four marines, I higher recommend not taking duplicate classes and some loot is class specific.  The leader & scout class are a must.  Marines have an allotted amount of action points which are depleted by one everytime a marine moves, fights, shoots, open doors, use items etc...  Fight your way to the elevator on each floor and take on the boss mob in order to advance.Easy mode is great to gets to grip with the game but the true mature of this game is best played on normal mode.  Easy mode is too easy, marines have lots of action points, enemies have lowered health and action points.  Not much of a challenge.Normal mode is good but is ridiculously difficult.  Ideally this needs nerfing slightly and for that reason I rate this game 6.5/10.  If normal mode was adjusted slightly to make it passably hard as appose to impossible I would rate this 8/10."

That's very rare for Roguelike games because it requires control multiple characters. But a mix of design elements makes it work very well. It's very surprising how light the play is despite you control 4 characters. Also the team aspect gives it a lot of originality and helps reinforce the depth.Another noteworthy element is how the game evokes Spacehulk/Alien, that's great.About Steampunk, look yourself the snapshots, it's very light, so don't really search that in the game.About about random range and diversity, it's here, enough to make a play enough different to another, and to keep the surprise which is an important element of the gameplay. But if my experience of Early Access is still valid, and additions hadn't changed it deeply, then the range of variations isn't huge like some of the biggest Roguelike. It's solid random and fair range of diversity of random, but don't expect much more. It's still enough to makes it a true Roguelike.Overall its key words are, very fun Roguelike, light play, good depth, team, Spacehulk/Alien."

I enjoyed it a lot, despite the fact that I've only made it past the first section once.Video Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4_ibJzI9F0What is it?Steam Marines is a rouge-like turn based strategy game. It's gameplay most closely resembles the old Space Hulk board game (also the more recent games of the same name). Every time you start you get to choose four soldiers, each of which has a class and a perk. You then enter a randomly generated space ship that is infested with evil robots. Your goal is to fight your way to the elevator and get to the next floor.There are five different decks of the ship that you have to go through. Each of these decks is divided into five levels with a boss on the final level. You always start on one deck, but you then get to choose where you go after you complete it. Each deck has its own asthetic and set of enemies that goes with it.Throughout the game, your soldiers will level up, thereby gaining skills and abilities, as well as get new equipment. This adds good depth to the later game (and probably stops you from being completely curb-stomped).I thought I might also note that if you have a less then four soldiers in your squad at the end of a floor you have a chance of getting a new soldier. You don't get to choose the class or perk, but this can at least give you a fighting chance if things don't go too well.Pros:-The game has a good variety of classes. In saying this, I mean that each class has a distinct role in the squad because of their specific weapon.-The enemies feel equal to your soldiers. In my opinion, a squad turn based strategy needs enemies that are on a similar level to your soldiers. Without that, it would either be so easy that you don't have to think tactically, or far too hard. Steam Marines strikes a nice balance.-There are distinct enemies. Through my journey I've seen enemies that are pure melee, pure range, ones that lose AP as you hit them, and ones that can't be damages from cenrtain sides. Each of these enemies needs to be dealt with using different tactics, which adds a good depth to the game.-Each deck has a difficulty rating. You might think that this doesn't mean that much, of course they do that just makes sense. You're right, it does make sense, but the permadeath makes that addition all the more important. You will know which deck is least likely to kill you and thereby least likely to lose you all of your hard work.Cons:-The random generation sometimes causes problems. It is possible to enter a level on that levels elevator. One would think that that would be a good thing, but there is a problem. The boss on the final level spawns on the elevator. The first time I made it to level five I spawned on the elevator, directly next to the boss. This is an almost guaranteed loss.-This con is not necessarily bad for everyone, but it still needs to be noted. The game is VERY difficult. I've played nine hours of the game and I only made it past the first deck once.-The system for executing the enemy turns is flawed. Firstly, on default settings the enemy turn will last an ungodly length of time. This can be easily fixed in the settings, but there is a bigger issue. The game has a setting that, in essence, focuses on the screen as the enemies move. It will do this not only for ones that you can see, but also enemies that you can't see around you. This gives you advanced warning of where enemies are. Turning this off means that it will NEVER follow enemy movements. Your screen is also locked in place while the enemy moves. I hope you kept all of squad together, or you won't get to watch the action. (Man, that was long winded)The game has some flaws, but overall I enjoyed it a lot. If you have played Dark Souls (and are hardnened to the idea of constant death) and enjoy squad turn-based strategy games then this game will hit the mark. It's a lot of deadly fun for $15."
