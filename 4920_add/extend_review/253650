And with about three hours put into the game and 100% of the achievements obtained, it's a good game for achievement hunters as well. If you're looking for a pretty game to sink a few hours into, then you could do worse than Sparkle 2 Evo, especially when it's on sale.The sound track ranges from the advertised 'relaxing' to 'wasps in eardrum' noises that made me check my speakers, but that may just be a matter of taste.It's in gameplay itself, and execution, where the game could've been great, but turns out to be just mediocre. In the beginning you're presented with the idea that eating certain types of food within the game will change the way your Spark evolves. This could have been very interesting, with different tactics for different branches, but the only difference in the 'food stuffs' is color. So yes, you can eat a non-meat fish. Maybe it's swimming algae. Even with the vivid color scheme, it can be difficult to tell which of the more advanced creatures correspond to which color without some trial and error.Finally there's the 'boss battles'. The bosses do not fight back, and one of them barely moves- victory consists of slowly nipping suicidally-depressed mega-fauna to death.But hey. It's pretty."

,Recommended,253650,7890529,"Posted: 2 December, 2013",all,Jeff The Riffer,"Several others have reviewed this game and said it's based on Spore. I presume they are referring to the very first stage of a Spore game which is just a mini-game. To be accurate, Spore (2008) actually copied flow (2006). Flow was originally a free flash game and was part of the creator's masters thesis.Yes, this game is VERY much like the game Flow on the PS3. But it is not the same game nor created by the same people. The mechanics are largely the same but this game goes for a more complex evolution where there's three different kinds of food (instead of 2) and you have to eat a LOT more to increase your creature's size.You get to look at the creature's stats as it grows and guide them by eating different types of food.If you enjoyed Flow you'll very likely enjoy this game. It's graphicsa are very vivid and colorful. It's slow paced with no set time limits or precise goals, so it's good for just chilling out. There's a few flaws like having to hold down the left mouse button constantly but you can use the keyboard to control it. But really it's quite enjoyable, especially if you are into playign zone/chill games"
,Recommended,253650,12602989,"Posted: 23 October, 2014",all,Rachel#SendMeYourUnwantedCoupons,"This game is very beautiful!It has 2 modes - single player or competition (against the AI). Single player can become boring very fast, because all you do is eat a certain amount of food (orbs) to finish the stage. Competition mode is fun because the AI actually challenges you and you can only go to the next stage if you win against the AI. But it also can become boring very fast, which didn't happen to me considering the game only has 14 stages and 2 of them are specifics to get achievements.The controls are easy enough most of the time. It can be a little frustrating depending on the evolution of your spark, but easy to manage.The game leads you to believe that your spark will evolve in different ways based on the type of food (orbs) you eat. That's not true. Not only the evolution of your spark is the same no matter what you eat, but you can't actually choose what to eat (not in competition mode at least, since you gotta beat the AI). You can choose what to eat in single player (the game only requires you to eat the necessary amount of food of at least one color), but it makes no difference whatsoever.The game is not worth the full price, but for 90% off I say go for it. You get trading cards and 22 achievements in a few hours. I didn't regret buying it. I suggest you watch a video of the gameplay though, just to be sure."

Start as a microscopic larva and build your way up the food chain as you evolve based on what you eat.Pros: Graphics are absolutely gorgeous. The game captures the transparency of actual microscope observation, while bathing it in a rainbow of colors. Your stats and appearance changes depending on whether you eat carnivore, herbivore or omnivore matter. You get to confront other microbes in a speed and twirl competition, trying to eat out its weak spots while avoiding its head until it's the only thing left. Music is calm and soothing.Cons: There is no behavior difference between your prey: the exact same creatures simply exists with different colors, making you wonder why a herbivore would eat fish, squids or other animals. You can't die, the extent of risk you face is getting pushed back up one level of depth, or getting a light red glow in the screen if you cannot be pushed up any further. Little replay value: there's a set number of levels with no randomization. There is little complexity over your evolution, and you might accidentally eat matter you wanted to avoid.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itThe game might look and sound exquisite, but there is little more to it. A few hours is all it will take to go through the entire game, do every level and max out your evolution. As it stands,Sparkle 2 Evodoesn't offer enough for me to recommend it.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)reviews."

Graphically it is a simple but gorgeous aquatic landscape, accompanied by a lush ambient electronica track, which changes as the levels change. It offers some incentive to finish the level quickly as the tracks, as ambient music is apt to do, can become somewhat repetitive and tedious. Movement and speed controls via mouse/keyboard are basic and intuitive, though game controller support would have been appreciated. Gameplay itself is very much a rinse and repeat, but the boss levels and species customization are fun. If Forever Entertainment chose to, they could pump in a few more updates and expand the look and feel of biomes, additional music tracks, and co-op options which could really add to the shelf life of a game like this. Still, I was very pleased. Fun game to chill out to, minimal learning curve, immersive environment, and a solid value at its curent price."

,Recommended,253650,13664066,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,Bowser from Sonic,"This a great little game, you could say it's one of those hidden gems.Although the playtime isn't that long, the visuals and music is incredible for a game that (most of the time) only costs 1$You play as a small microorganism climbing the evolutionary ladder by eating one of three microelements:-Red which makes your Sparkle (as your species is called) faster and more manouvrable, however at the cost of eating speed.-Blue which makes your sparkle more balanced in the way of movement and eating speed but sadly looking quite uninteresting.-Green which makes your sparkle incredible at eating with the highest eating speed and a skill that makes your mouth about 5x bigger, however it isn't very fast and his turning speed also ins't too great. However the green sparkle is in my opinion the best looking sparkle.As you grow more and more instead of eating stationary microelements you start encountering species, most of which have ways of stopping you eating them often in the form of a slow trap. others take a long time to be fully eaten and until they are they will keep pushing you a level upwards if you touch their head, and others are relatively peaceful but require you to find a way into their body to eat their guts and finally decapitate them.Each stage of evolution your sparkle evolves visually, at first growing longer and developing a type of sac to show you its road to the next level by the size of it, after that it will grow jaws or in the case of the omnivore it will grow even longer, after that evolution truly branches and  every sparkle will go it's own way, i will not spoil this because they look too beautiful to explain.Though the levels are few (there are only 14) there are 2 optional boss battles, The Squid-Worm and the Octury.The Squid-Worm is a large worm that requires you to eat all of his segments before eating his head, not too hard but it looks great and it's a fun way to show yourself how far you've come in your mad dash to become the top species in the sea.The Octury is a humongous octopus that will make you eat all the glowing orbs on it's tentacles before entering it's head and devouring it from the inside out, though -once more not very challenging it's a huge monster that is great to look at in comparison to your little sparkle.This is a great game and if you like Flow or need something relaxing in your library i definitely reccomend you to pick it up, it's very cheap and there are even trading cards to be gained."

Sparkle 2 Evo looks like it should be the real deal, but sadly, it's nothing more than a glorified game of Hungry Hippos, if you know what I mean. There's very little strategy to it. It's just a race to see who can gobble down the most of one of three different types of nutrients that turn you into a herbivore, a carnivore, or an omnivore. It's not really any kind of fun and the evolution aspect has no depth."
,Recommended,253650,8957432,"Posted: 2 February, 2014",all,mark | dj.,Sparkle 2 Evo is basically a PC version of Fl0w for the PS3. It's exactly the same in that you're a creature that has to work its way up the foodchain by eating food and enemies that are smaller than you. You'll eventually grow bigger allowing you to eat bigger enemies. Like Fl0w you'll be switching back and forward between 'scenes' trying to find where the food is located.Even the graphics are in the same style.You could say it pays homage to the PS3 game but in my opinion it's just a shameless carbon copy of it. But since we PC gamers are lacking a proper Fl0w I guess this will do nicely in the meantime. It's the only reason I'd recommend this really.[Rating: 70/100]

The difficulty doesn't really increase, but the areas become larger and there are more elements to collect in each level for completion, as well as a larger array of different kinds of life as you progress. You don't die, but there is a ""Competitive mode"" that times you and pits you against other critters (controlled by AI) like yourself, all trying to gather as many resources as fast as possible before time runs out. That mode isn't fun, but I just turn the option off.Overall, I recommend because it's easy and relaxed, and I had fun with it.Only issue is that it's repetitive once you've done it a single time, so nothing really feels new.It's worth buying at discount, but probably not full price."

Upon inspecting the achievements I could not turn down an easy to complete game as an achievement hunter. In the same night that I bought the game, I completed the game 100%  in around 3 hours.During the course of the game I was not sure if I was expecting more or if I was expecting too much. The mechanics of the game were fairly basic and never evolved a whole lot. There were some interesting levels and others felt like they took too long to complete. The use of layers in the game suits it very well and they used that quite effectively at some points while at other times it felt like there should be layers when there weren't any at all.The mechanic of eating is simple and the evolution based off of that feels somewhat lacking. I did not feel like I was ultimately challenged in different ways because of these changes. As such, the level of difficulty was not remotely close to challenging in my experience. At times, I was not even sure exactly on what I supposed to do in some of the boss levels. Even when I did figure it out, it felt like it took unnessesarily long to wait for the boss to be interactable.So was this game worth it for the amount of fun? I don't feel like I wasted my time due to the achievements I decided to get, but I personally feel like something is missing. I'm not sure what that is exactly."

The graphics show that it isn't native to PC and any resolution larger than 800x600 is going to show every pixel. People have described this as ""not a game"". They are right. But unfortunately it isn't great as art either. I bought it for $5 on sale and I don't think it is worth even that much, at least with how they described it. If they listed this as a port and not as an ""artistic non-game"" I might not feel tricked like I do. I don't know what kind of gameplay other's have experienced but I was unable to evolve my creature, and that was the only interesting thing about this game that would have redeemed it. The soundtrack is awful, and I also don't know what kind of people were saying that it was beautiful and entrancing. It's cheap sounding and doesn't sound at all professional on a decent set of speakers (which I'm guessing is due to the upscaling from iOS to Windows).

The game is very fun. It consists of a casual simulation of an evolving life form you control that floats in water and tries to feed itself in order to evolve. The gameplay mechanic is somewhat reminescent of Spore's first stage. The graphics are dreamlike and the art style is impressive, the music sets the ambient rather well and the gameplay concept, although so simple and basic, manages to captivate you for a good few hours. Difficulty wise, the game is incredibly easy but it is meant to be a time-occupier (waster is innapropriate in this context), not a competitive game, although you have that option. While the game is fun, it lacks a few concepts that would have greatly improved it, and it kind of bugs me in a game that is concentrated on evolution: the lack of creature customization, as the creature grows soley based on what type of food you eat, and the lack of an endless mode, where the level is randomly generated. Other than that, it is a great game to spend your ""Im so bored"" time, and though not perfect, a great indie title."

I own all three included ""games"" and I want to review them all.I have already recommended the first, no, the ""Zeroth"" (don´t know whether this word exists) part, because of it´s epic looks. Previous point is basically the mark of all three games; epic visuals but, well, questionable gameplay. Evo comes up to those too, but with some changes which disturbed me in some ways. So now I am heading to describe the game a little.There are just three aims in Sparkle 2 Evo:Eat, grow, evolve. That´s it. So for this nothing changes. And here comes the publishers´ ""clue"": Competetive mode. Yes, that´s as hillarious as it sounds. You are ""fighting"" against an AI in matches lasting WAY too long. The one eats more stuff ""wins"" and if that´s you, you´ll unlock the next stage, which is basically the same as the previous, just with new colors and soundtracks. Wait, there´s annother way to obtain your progress, next to competetive mode: You can also eat EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF NUTRIENS on the ENTIRE map. Because of the ""innovative"" controls, that are as precise as my aiming in CS:GO, (trust me, you don´t even want to see me using the AWP) that can easily take you 20 minutes of your precious lifetime. Okay, just joking, but not lying.Annother negativ fact are the ""enemies""... They CONTAIN the nutrients you need to win the level, but there´s always just one way to get them. And if you fail by half a visual milimeter, you´ll be pushed into annother layer of the ""Abyss"" (that´s what the game-world is called) over and over again... Unfortunately your AI oponnent has better luck with that.The only two things GOOD about this game are the visuals, as usual, and the fact you get the soundtrack for free. It´s not a extraordinary good one but at least a nice deal to compensate the EULA, which only says ""No EULA, just have fun""...Is there really need to discuss about this anymore?What I had almost forgotten to mention is, that Sparkle 2 was developed by other guys as Sparkle 3 and Zero were. They didn´t do a bad job (in relation to the other two games) but they also didn´t really make it better. As for normal, achievements are gained by progress and evolution isn´t only useless but also it does only depend on what color the food you eat has. Yeah, pretty much like in the other games.Sincerely, Titanic21; 21th December 2016; 9:12 pm; CET. (Just don´t take me too serious as for this review. My opinion is honest, but the rest is not.)"
,Recommended,253650,8953703,"Posted: 2 February, 2014",all,Chris Fifty-Two,This game is a weird mix of the early stages of Spore and flOw from the PS3 were you play a creature that evolves by eating different coloured orbs and you move on from stage to stage buy eating enough of them and improving on your creature. Mostly played in the games casual mode and when doing that the games really goes super casual and was an alright passtime while listen to podcasts and music. For me it was never more then a timewaster.Most achievements will be thrown at you for simply progressing and the only stuff that will take some extra focus is beating the two bosses in the game and both of them are things you simply can't fail on...you just need to spend enough time on them to figure out how to beat them. Very easy game to complete.Time to 100%:3 hours

(Don't expect Spore Cell Stage nor Flow)As someone with a great intrest for evolution and with a weak spot for every game that tries to simulate evolution I had to try this game. At first sight this game reminded me of Flow (awesome game), and not as much of the Spore Cell Stage as others where saying. If you're expecting a game like Spore, don't buy this game.Due to the beautiful and original visuals the game feels wonderous, mysterious and very alien. But nonetheless the first few stages of this game are very boring and confusing (imo). You're really waiting for stuff to happen, but instead you only get to eat blue, green and red balls untill you ate enough of them to finish the stage. After eating enough of these balls, you'll level up and you're creature will change it's form, but that doesn't really feel like evolution.After a few stages of boringness other creatures start to appear you can eat, even bosses you can eat and defeat. This was quite a (positive) surprise to me. At this point I realized there was atually some challenge to this game. See, throughout the game you've got a 'nemesis' who will try to eat as much as it can, just like you, after you or you're nemesis has prodominemntly ate most of the food in that particular stage, one of you will win. I think that is pretty cool and original.What's also a cool aspect of this game is that your creature will gain all kinds of stats that will improve your creature performances, I haven't played around with that much so I don't wan't to say to much about it. But I think that is part of the game that is meant to be the evolution part.I feel like this game needs more polishing, it just doens't feel complete. I would like to see more evolution aspects and more challenge, that isn't repetitive."

I have written this after completing the game and all achievements.Gameplay: 8/10You explore three-dimensional levels by navigating along the X and Z axies and collecting colored orbs. Once you think you've got all the orbs you want on a layer, you can then go up or down layers. The colors of the orbs are very important because they influence your evolution. Although many of the evolutions seem to add only minor visual effects and slight stat bonuses, you can get special abilities and end up looking really cool.Graphics: 9.5/10No one is perfect, but the graphics here are spectacular. While not overwhelming, they definitely enhance the experience, from the awesome range of colors and enviroments in the game to the look of your... organism... thing... they really amazed me.Performance: 8/10Even on my low-power computer (two cores, $100 video card, 2GB RAM), this ran very smoothly even with everything turned all the way up.Features: 5/10This has no online multiplayer, as far as I could tell. You could play against a bot or create more organisms, but the lack of real multiplayer was a real bummer. The achievements were fulfilling, but not too hard to get, just the way I personally like it.Ambience: 8.5/10I got sucked in to the game immediately. The sounds were soothing and enveloping, and coupled nicely with the graphics. This is one of the few games I would not want to play my own music instead of their music. It was really nice.Replayability: 4/10Honestly, you could replay the game, maybe go down a different path, but the levels are the same, and coupled with the lack of multiplayer and very straightforward gameplay it would be a grind.Summary: 7.2/10Good game, it was a certainly a worthwjile $1 (I think I bought it while it was on sale) and probably a worthwhile use of $5. I had a very good time with it and I feel like it was less of a time-waster than other games, and more of an experience."

I really like it's look.The gameplay is a little numb, but no more so than say PacMan, and I loved PacMan.I have hit a bug in what little time I've been playing though. I didn't expect to find any, but since the controls are a little bulky feeling and I can't get the ASDW to work, I often barrel right into obstacles, and I accidentally buried my little guy into what I guess was some kind of paralyzing jellyfish thing that was caught in a whirlpool with the tide pushing me further and further into the jellyfish. After about a good minute and a half of me anticipating some kind of glitch out of where I was stuck, my little germ rocketed up and appearently clear out of the level. Everything raced by and once it finally slowed down, it turned around and restricted my movement to normal speed and only back towards where I came from. I waited about 5 minutes but never made it back to the play-field before giving it up for the time being.Get it while it's on sale, I might've been a little unhappy with a typical purchase of Sparkle2Evo, but as demonstrative games go, this one is a decent enough piece of eyecandy that I've so far enjoyed."

I also wish there were a way to evolve your creature differently. It seemed that each type of organism always had one outcome. They all ended up being things that looked like a centepide, moth, and a mosquito. If there were a way to perhaps combine the elements that were used the most, that would be wonderful. Another thing was the gene lab. It seemed logical yet i couldn't dicipher how to fully optimize my creature. It also would have been cool to have mutations. Perhaps somehow having two heads or being a carnivore with the ability of one of the others. Add some randomness to the game. Also was there ever a first one? If not, I'm looking forward to a second one. :Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFBZeQftAlA&list=TLjkI6pstFEbZp8kIMkzlj-nvIqXwCYx-h"

Just a Flow clone?Many people say and think this is a Flow clone, I personally have never played Flow, nor have I watched videos so that will not be influencing this review.Sparkle 2 Evo is about a three hour long game, where you control a microorganism where your goal is to eat to evolve. What you evolve into depends on WHAT you eat, so eating red makes you a carnivore, blue an omnivore, and green an herbivore. Depending on which of the three you become you get special little extra stats, for example the carnivore being the fastest. What you eat ranges from bits of food floating around, to giant squids fifty times your size. Also, each animal you eat requires a specific tactic to beat, for example, using the tactic that’s used on a glass squid wouldn’t work on a skeleton, which makes the latter levels in the game more interesting, and creates some great, well thought out boss battles. There’s also an GenLab, so you can see which of the three traits you use the most, and what your current bonuses are (developers said you can use the lab to change your creature, leading to people believing you're supposed to do it in the GenLab, but they were more getting at the fact that you can change your creature based on what you eat). There’s also a competitive mode where you try to eat more than the opposing AI, fun but not too interesting.A lot of complaints come from this game 'not looking good' or being pixelated, and not having the option to change resolutions. Well, don’t listen to those, because you can adjust resolutions, and it can look damn near perfect on the highest settings. With that having been said, the visuals are beautiful, absolutely just full of vibrant colors, and this may actually be my favorite part of this game. Various corals, and other large debris define the maps, and change depending on the depths of the levels, and location, which I think can be really good at times. The music, well, isn’t amazing. It’s not BAD, but could have used a little more variety.Now for the problems, this game is buggy as heck. One of the more infamous glitches causes you to not be able to progress any further on a boss battle you just spent eight minutes trying to beat, forcing you to restart, and possibly having you do it a third time. Another major bug was a missing species that was required to be killed for an achievement, but recently this has been patched. The last bug I’m going to mention is when the keys stop working. Yes, they completely stop, even when you exit to the main menu and the level reloaded, they still won’t work, forcing you to shut down the game and restart it. And the biggest problem in the game, you can’t be hurt. Did a creature ten times your size just bite you? Well, better throw you up towards the surface then. This completely removes any urgency in the game, making it more boring than it should be (entertaining nonetheless).Pros:beautiful visualscomplex evolution systemgood boss battles (sometimes boring though)Cons:bugs, glitches, etc.controls are… offyour “compass” is confusing at firstcant take damageI would recommend waiting for this game to go on sale (as it often does) if you get it.Score: 5/10Score (if the three mentioned bugs were removed): 7/10Curator page:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/"

There are around 10 levels available, and each level is filled with resources and other organisms you can eat. At first I thought that you just eat everything, but it's best to eat one color resources, so you evolve further. Green resources make you bigger and slower yet you can eat faster, red ones make you move faster yet reduce your eating speed, and blue ones are in between.Game is fun little time killer that is around 3 hours long with easy achievements. Only thing required to play is mouse and ability to see three colors (red, blue, green). If you get grossed out by bugs and crawling things with tails and tentacles, then check in game footage beforehand. Otherwise it's nice little game."

There are basically 3 colors of food. Which color you consume the most will determine the type of creature you'll become:- red (carnivore)  => you'll move fast but eat slowly- green (herbivore) => you'll eat fast but move slowly- blue (omnivore) => medium movement speed and medium eating speedAt first red, green and blue blobs just float in the ocean and you eat them to practice the movement of your creature. In later levels, you'll encounter other sea creatures in a variety of shapes but basically you always need to stay away from their head (or they will push you away) until you've eaten what parts of their body you can eat, and then go in for the kill by eating their head.You can play the game in two modes: competitive mode (default) or 'casual mode'. I strongly suggest leaving competitive mode on and only switching it off if you find the game too hard, which isn't very likely. You see, the game gets pretty easy once you figured out how it works. You start at the top layer' of the ocean. You will see radar 'pings' in red, green or blue telling you in which direction there is food of that color. When you don't see any pings anymore, you go down to the next layer and look at your screen for radar pings. Again you hunt and eat until you don't see any pings anymore, then you go down to next layer and so on. If you want, you can focus (more) on one type of food to become your preferred creature type (carnivore, herbivore or omnivore) but in my opinion that is something better left for casual mode because in competitive mode, it's better to just eat everything you find.The graphics are very nice. The music is very subtle and fitting. The Steam Achievements are easy to complete (you'll most likely complete them before you complete the game, unless you happened to miss something). It's a nice game to play for a few hours but don't expect something it's not. Don't expect a twitchy action game or a puzzle-like game that will challenge you for dozens of hours. If the game looks like something you might enjoy, I recommend giving it a go, especially if it's on sale."

There is no real 'end' or 'death' in the game; you begin by selecting one of a few single-cell creatures to play as, then spend however much time you have to kill kind of just floating around, eating stuff and exploring a visually appealing environment. As you eat, you grow, and can eat larger and larger prey. If you get damaged by other craetures, you shrink. Depending on what you eat, and in what order you eat it, life grants you different evoloutionary advantages as you progress.The game ends when you get bored and put the controller down, or pick another creature to play as.

This reminds me of The Munchables (a very kiddish Wii game) and Electroplankton from the Nintendo DS from Nintendo. The game is about you starting off as a newly born organisim in a huge world where you must fight for survival by eating other types of food under the floor of the Ocean area you are currently in. As you ""eat"" more certain organisims your character will level up and become anything from a balanced character to a Herbivore to a Carnivore based creature. The Controls for this game are simple you can either use keyboard moving with W A S AND D or using your Mouse you can click and hold to make your character swim to the area. The control is this game is very tight. I thought for a game that was only being offered for $5 Wasn't going to be worth my time at all But it is a very awesome game. The Graphics are pretty damn impressive for a game that only wants $5 for it. The Controls are easy to get used to and seeing all the changes in the scenery as you dive or rise in the water (using X to Dive and Z to Rise) all change in real time. Everything from seeing huge Coral multi colored reefs, to even seeing a Whirlpool almost suck you in it is all very colorful and this game should be given a chance. Only thing That is missing that would make this game EVEN better is Steam Trading Cards. Here is hoping the game recieves an update for them. They would be pretty awesome to collect. 9/10"

It comes with a soothing soundtrack to match its visual style. However, the gameplay is repetitive which is both the game's strong and weak point. It doesn't offer anything more beyond what you do in the first level (swim around, eat other organisms, sometimes evolve) but because of that it's  easy to understand and get into.The number of evolutions boil down to three (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore) per developmental stage so there's not much to play around with. You follow the pulsating lights to find food and once you have found it, you feed by simply swimming through it. You win by eating a set amount of food which can get tricky if you are a slowpoke and let other creatures nab your dinner. There are standard, static food such as algae and floating bits of meat but the higher level prey have fun little gimmicks to them. As an example, if you want to consume a baby squid you first need to snip away at its nervous system on the front then the poison glands on the back before it's weakened enough to be gobbled up.The best feature of the game is the inclusion of an optional non-competitive mode which removes the other hungry contestants so you can hunt for food at your own leisure."

Nothisg really kills you, so no action in there; this game is no where near simulation. The only part of it that pushes you to try harder is the ai that tries to pick more points, and fater than you. In that regard it's like a racing game, sort of, since when you reach a certain point count, you win. It's really casual, as much of what you need to do to get points is to gobble up as much food as you can, and little strategy or tactics to do that except to do it fast.The other thing that bugs me is the class system, there are the carnivores(red), the harbivores(green), and a blue class i'm not sure about. This game is barely tries to stay accurite to these classes as all of them can gain their colour points by feeding on other organisems. carnivores will often eat inanimate red sphreres too.4One might think that in such a game, where it pretends to simulate an evolution the traits of one class will hold throughout the game... Well this is not the case since every time you level up you might change your appeaence to the other class, seemengly at random. Sometimes the visible traits will transfer to another form, line the carnivore's tail, but it still quite un logical. The only thing that does pass are the mechanical traits, like carnivore's speed, or herbivores agility.If you're looking for a beautiful casual arcade game, this is it.If you're interested in an action, or a simulation, do yourself a favour and pass."

While the game has multiple z-axis ""planes"", it is a game largely played on a 2-dimensional field, where you basically just guide your little critter to eat things until you grow up.  There are three ""paths"" to go down, which you traverse through eating colored blobs of three colors.There are two modes.In the non-competitive mode, you basically just get dumped on a map, and get told to eat everything of one color to go to the next map.  There's essentially no way to lose, but to quit, which I suppose is what makes it ""casual"", and it's not like games need to be hard to be enjoyable, but there's no particular story, here, to make the world more compelling without it.  There's some ""exploration"", just to see all the different critters, but once you have seen every level, you've seen everything the game has to offer.In the ""competitive mode"", you have an AI-controlled critter competing with you for food, where victory is measured in hogging more food than the other guy can get.  While hypothetically, this means challenge and desperately trying to hunt creatures for food faster, regardless of color, in practical effect, you can just stay green and vacuum up everything far faster than your opponent, since the extra bits of food from dividing food pieces all count to your total, and you can consume more food from critters than the game expects to count. In general, I could eat several times more food than the opponent, and never once seemed like I was in trouble unless I completely abandoned attempting to eat for a while.The big choice in the game about which critter to be is somewhat defeated by the imbalance in the practical use of the different criters.  The ""carnivore"" red is quick to accelerate, and gets a ""dashing"" skill to ""attack"" other creatures.  The ""herbivore"" green (and I put ""herbivore"" in quotes because you still hunt and eat other animals, you just want to eat the green ones) has faster eating time (making it so you can eat as fast as you ram through food, rather than skipping over food for a second or so) and has a super AoE suction attack that consumes all food in the area.  The ""omnivore"" blue (which, somehow, eats a different food entirely from both carnivores and herbivores, rather than just eating both in roughly equal measure,) gets a better turning radius and a defensive sound skill that makes creatures flee from it.Hypothetically, in a game where combat mattered, the difference between an attack skill, a defense skill, and a resource-gathering skill might mean something, but since all you do in this game is eat, the herbivore skill is fantastically useful and makes the game significantly faster and less frustrating, while the omnivore defenseskill is useless since you need to hunt critters, rather than have them flee you, and the carnivore dash attack is pointless since the only enemies that run from you do so across the z-axis, which the dash will not go across.Ultimately, I recommend this game only on sale for the sheer color and fascination of it.  It's odd and interesting, and worth looking at, and on sale, you can get it dirt cheap enough to justify buying it for aesthetics alone, but there isn't enough actual gameplay to keep you in it.  This is a game you can completely ""play out"" and feel you've experienced everything it can offer in just a half-dozen hours."

Not being told what your 'special power' does leads to ignoring it. Activating it requires you to stop moving and double click on the head of your sparkle. It breaks the flow of the game to do that. Would it have been such a problem to assign it to a key?I ate only green and blue food, looking to create a slightly different type of herbivore, but it doesn't matter. You eat enough of one type of food, you level up and turn into that type of creature. I got trapped in red food, had to eat my way out, and changed into a predator.

All you do is walk around, ""eat"" some things and beat the AI competitor. If it can be called that, because its realy easy to beat it.The leveling system is moot. You have to eat everything you can as fast as you can, so its almost useless to try and level up as you with.But, the real reason I cannot recommend this game is because this made me sick. I mean, reall sick, throw-up-in-the-toilet sick. So, if you are anything like me and gets sick after a bit of too colorfull games (like this one and Super Hexagon), stay the hack away."

I bought this for around a dollar from a sale Sparkle had.  For someone like me, who attempts to game on a system that is not meant for gaming, it runs very well and offers mesmerizing graphics.  Gameplay is very relaxed as it is meant to be, and I enjoy watching my organism  grow with every little thing it eats.  Definitely not a hardcore experience - this is meant to relax a gamer after a brutal encounter with the outside world.  The only drawback is the lack of variety the game has.  As an indie, this game has great potential to expand on possibly more evolutions, more nutrients, and  changable characteristics to the organism."

Played non-stop when I first got it.Unfortunately, there are a few bugs (minor spoiler):_______________________________________________________________________________________-Some of the levels were marked as ""completed"" even though I haven't even got to them yet.-The boss battle in Octury Deep is literally unbeatable because the game seems to prevent me even touching any of the octupus' tentacles. I understand that you have to use a special in order to descend deeper and become closer to the tentacles, but even when I do, the bulbs are unable to be eaten even though I head for the lowest one first.-Another Octury Deep bug may be using the special in order to descend deeper into the boss' tentacles. For me, I was only able to use my special a grand total of three times (without being able to even descend) before I'm stuck swimming forever without hope of defeating the boss. It required me to exit and restart the battle again, and at one point even restart the game because the pause options didn't appear. I retried many times, but unfortunately, the bug remained. I couldn't progress through the battle.______________________________________________________________________________________Conclusion/TL;DR:Aside from the major bug in one of the boss battles, the game is worth playing. The details are stunning, the controls are pretty smooth, and it overall piqued my enjoyment."

Instead the change is purely visual and picking only one feeding style (herbi/carni/omnivore) doesn't appear to have any major differences over the others. Another thing that annoyed me was that you couldn't be hurt or die. Being attacked by a larger creature simply makes you flee to a higher layer and is more of an annoyance than anything else.

A pleasure to play or even just watch it be played.In terms of gameplay, however, I think fl0w did a better job as a tide pool game. In fl0w, all creatures are made upof edible ""bits"" which other creatures can eat, including the player. This makes the player vulnerable in the same way as the bigger enemies in the later game - get all your ""bits"" eaten, and a bite to the head will be your death.Something like this would have made Sparkle 2 Evo far more exciting. There would be peril beyond just getting pushed up to a higher level.Furthermore, the DNA mechanics could have been made far more influential. Maybe it could be possible to have different physical traits from each of the three pathways. This could be reandomic, or dependent on which color each bar of the DNA gets filled (e.g. one line determines the mouth, another a leg, a bunch for the tail, etc.), or have the player choose. Dunno. It just feels kinda pointless as it is.Finally, needs more levels and different enemies. Maybe make it so certain enemies can only appear for a certain type of food (such as only red & blue fish; have the green fish replaced by algae stuck to the rocks, floating pieces of algae or something that is not a plant fish because WTF)."

Making the gameplay experience a bit strained as I had to restart the game from the start.Graphics: 9/10Simply stunning in my opinion, they feel clean and uncut. Though having a more of a bubble feeling when it comes down to it is quite the opposite, for you find great detail in the colors themselves immersing you into the gameThe game having a wide selection of options when it comes down to picking a graphical face for the game.Why not 10/10 even though there is little fault if any to the graphics, there is simply something there you cannot put your thumb over.Story - NoneIf you are someone that likes story in games, then this game is not for you having no explanation nor understanding what you are doing, do you find yourself eating these blue, red or green bubbles in order to grow. While at the same time you are feasting as some type of parasite on creatures of the sea.Music: 7/10I found the music itself great at times having a deep immersion though I found it break at times as a certain ""song"" started, giving me this annoying immersion break, which I found of course extremely bad. The music itself is played over and over so you get quickly turned off from it, but while it lasted you’re going to be in a zone you wish you could stay in.SummaryGood game, could be better. But for the cost it is asking for a definite yes, if you want a casual relaxing game which you can simply sit back and enjoy the atmosphere."

There you start as a bacteria, which eats the smaller ones but have to get away from the bigger ones, until it grows and gets revenge on those suckers. Well, Sparkle 2 Evo is similar to that part of Spore with some exceptions. For example, here you simply cannot die - the worst thing other organisms can do to you is kick you to the previous layer. Also, levels are similar to each other - you swim, eat elements, go deeper, sweem, eat elements, go deeper, level complete, start over. And that makes the game really boring. Yeah, I know it is meant to be relaxing, but it's not - at least for me. When I'm bored, I don't get relaxed - I get annoyed. And that game annoyed me as hell. So I strongly don't recommend it - that stage of Spore is a lot more fun, and there are more stages. Well, if boring equals relaxing to you - you can give Sparkle 2 Evo a try.

,Recommended,253650,13927981,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Whutzupdoug,"I usually don't do lengthy reviews on games, but this is one that interests me.Sparkle 2 Evo is a game where you eat stuff and grow. That's pretty much it for the concept. There are different things you can eat, which would be herbivore food, carnivore food, and omnivore food. No, they are not called plants, meat, or both.It's a pretty laid back game. In my experience, there really is no way to lose. The opponent AI is pretty dumbed down and moves at a snail's pace. There isn't much else to the game other than: eat, grow, repeat. It really doens't make much of a difference what you choose to eat either.If you choose to be a carnivore, you move faster, but you can only eat one thing at a time. If you choose to be an herbivore, you move significantly slower, but you can eat more things in an instance. I still have yet to figure out what's different about being an omnivore, since it's basically the same as being a carnivore.You basically pick red, blue, or green. Sound familiar?The control scheme is a bit weird. It's functional, but it's weird. You make incredibly wide turns and you'll find yourself running into walls a lot. At least with keyboard/mouse controls. You can pick either keyboard or mouse. I have yet to try out the controller, but I've heard that's what this game is meant for.At points, the game will just seem to drag out. You'll be searching through each layer several times once the level starts to run out of food. You don't win until all the food is eaten (in my experience), and since the opponent AI is slow and often idle, this may take a while. For as far as I've gotten, there really is no sense of urgency.Overall, I wouldn't know what to give this game on a 1-10 scale, but it's relaxing, and it's dirt cheap. If you've ever wanted an expanded version of the first stage in Spore, here it is."

I really like the design of the NPC creatures and the way you have to eat them one piece at a time until you can go for their heads.You can only control your creature's appearance by what food you eat and figuring out how to min/max takes longer than it probably should.  If you only eat the color you want, it takes a long time.  The hints lead you astray.  Once you learn it, it makes a lot of sense.  The competitive mode is not very difficult, but it's more fun than running around alone if you ask me.  The boss battles are kind of drawn out, but make for a spectacle.The achievements are easy, if you're into that.  They only took me maybe two hours to 100% over two sessions.

For future reference, I bought this game during a steam sale but I might have just bought it full price if I discovered it before now.ART 10/10So, the art of the game is very veryveeeerrrrygood, so much so I would say its the highlight of this game, despite the other features. It is absolutely stunning. I have a decent PC so I immediately turned the graphics up to full, and they do not disappoint. These are some of the best visuals I've seen, with everything from the color-faded background to the transparent 3-D 'walls'. I love these graphics.MUSIC 8/10The music has a kind of tranquil feeling to it, and helps to relax into the game. It flows very well with the gameplay, and the sound effects aren't dominating over it, nor vice versa. There is a very good balance here in my opinion.GAMEPLAY 6/10This is pretty good as well, although its not a revolutionary game in this aspect. I have had fun so far playing this game, and I think I will continue to do so, but the art and the music are the main hooks for me. It has a very similar feeling to the early stage of Spore, but it is the entire game. If you liked that, you would probably like this game.STORY 2/10You are evolving a thing. That's it. That's the whole story. Not that this game really needs a story.CONCLUSION 7.5/10This game is very fun and relaxing to play, and is great if you have a spare 5 minutes to kill.  This game doesn't quite make it to an 8 as I don't think it has the ability to entertain for a long period of time. Also, some of the mechanics in the game could use some refining but that's just me.

I snagged this game for 74 cents. The game itself is simple, you are an organism that goes around in the level eating other microorganisms to level up all while competing against an AI. The more you eat, the more you grow.Hands down, the graphics are gorgeous. The game is beautiful, especially when you get your organism to a high level. Even running it at ""Good"" settings in the launcher, I was shocked. Everything is so bright (except for the first few stages of the game, which have a darker yellow-brownish kind of background).The gameplay is debateable. Some find it boring, others find it good. People argue it's boring because you only get so many options for leveling and there isn't much diversity in power. This game has a casual tag for a reason. I think it's good enough given the games length and cost. Don't go into this game thinking it's going to be as epic as Skyrim or something. It's gameplay is simple and calm. (Though when you turn your organism into a bottomless eating machine, it's fun to sprint around killing other organisms and steal them from your opponent!)The music: awesome, though it all depends on your taste of music.In a nutshell, the game is as good as it's going to get. The sights and sounds are amazing, and the amount of action you are going to get in this game all varies on your playstyle.Overall: 8/10, would eat again."

You can't really die.2.  You have to eat a full set of colored ""pelets"" to proceed to the next level (red, green, or blue).  This is fine however before long, there are different sized pellets and different animals of the color you are going for.  Some times the small pellet counts towards completing the level, other times it does not.  Same with animals.  Eating some helps to progress while other times that same animal does not contribute to level progress.Am I upset I bought the game?  No,.. I spent $0.49 and played it for about an hour.  If I can get one hour of game play for every dolllar spent on Steam, I consider it a good deal.  Spend $20 = 20 hours, spend $1 for 1 hour.

There are roughly 15 stages (including 2 boss fights - 1 simple and 1 complicated). There are two modes - with or without AI who will compete with you on the eating. As you progress, more difficult creatures spawn and you figure out that color doesn't really matter as much since you may just eat them all. There's no ""how much more until next level up"" indicators (I believe), so as you eat, you will grow..at some point.

,Recommended,253650,31952036,Posted: 25 May,all,E-200 Paragon,"For a knockoff, this game certainly deserves recognition.SummarySparkle 2: Evo is a top-down game based on the flash game known asflOw.In flOw, you play as a serpentine creature whose sole purpose is to eat other creatures.As you descend, the enemies gain more hitpoints and become harder to kill.At the bottom is a powerful creature that is fast and dangerous that you have to defeat.Once you beat the final boss, the game resets and then control a jellyfish-like creature.You then have to repeat the process with your previous creature now serving as the final boss.Once you beat the final boss again, the game resets with the original serpentine creature.The game got so popular that a port was developed and released for all PlayStation platforms.Now that you know what flOw is, let's get to the summary of Sparkle 2 Evo.This game is literally a stylized PC version of flOw.You play as the aforementioned serpentine creature known as a Sparkle.Along with the traditional mechanics found in flOw, you also get to choose between three different variants based on what you consume throughout each zone.Each variant has a special ability that changes the gameplay and difficulty.You'll know which one the Sparkle will become based on the colored trail it leaves as it swims.The transformation happens automatically upon filling up your Experience Bar.If you eat anything that glows red, you will become a Carnivore.The Carnivore is fast and maneuverable, but can be hard to control sometimes.Its special ability is Lunge, which shoots the Sparkle forward extremely fast.If you eat anything that glows green, you will become a Herbivore.The Herbivore is bulky and tough but is slow and cannot turn that well.Its special ability is Inhale, which automatically collects any food within range of its mouth.If you eat anything that glows blue, you will become an Omnivore.The Omnivore is a jack-of-all-trades since it has the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.Its special ability is Screech, which makes all animals run away from you for a short time.ProblemsYou would think that since it's based on such a popular game with such a simple design and mechanics, there wouldn't be that many problems with this game right? (ha ha ha, WRONG!)For one thing, the Sparkle variants all move and turn at the same speed.That means it doesn't matter which type you are since only the special abilities are different.In addition, it only takes one hit from ANY predator to force you back up one level.The second problem is that the camera is in a fixed position that spins around the Sparkle.Imagine trying to walk while constantly looking at your feet and bobbing your head in a circle.In other words, your field of view is hindered by the camera's motion since you won't be able to see what's in front of you until the camera spins around to reveal what's in front of you.There are other problems as well, but I have to keep my reviews within a tolerable length.ConclusionAside from the problems, this is a very amazing game.The levels are surreal, the music is lovely, and the graphics look fantastic.However, I'll be honest, the ending was very disappointing considering flOw had a final boss.Regardless, it still achieved the same goal as flOw did, which is immersive relaxation."

Great idea, Great art, terrible gameplay.Edit:  If you keep playing, you find creatures you can sort of fight.  I wouldn't buy it off of sale thoughBut♥♥♥♥♥♥.. it was 49 cents!"
,Not Recommended,253650,29886357,Posted: 12 February,all,Omnifarious,"This is kind of a meandering game in which the objectives are not terribly clear. And, unlike Flow, it's clear that the game was written with actual objectives in mind.So, that makes this game a poorly executed knockoff of Flow, which was/is an excellent game. I do not generally mind copycat games, especially if they at least bring something new to the table and are executed at least as well as the original. But, while this game does bring something new to the table (you are what you eat) its poor execution leaves it a pale imitator rather than an evolutionary innovator."

And this is ok, if relaxing colors are what you want. It was for me, because after reading a few reviews, I didn't expect more (and got it on sale).But: I cannot play the game for more than ten minutes straight, because the constant circling and the general ""fluffiness"" of the movements just make me feel dizzy. After 15 minutes, this starts to turn into sickness.So as great as the game looks, people prone to seasickness might get problems."

It has surprisingly good 2D graphics and the sounds fits well, at least you like smooth electronic music. The gameplay is simple and for such a few money (< 5 €) i am not complaining about the noticed bugs."

Don't think it would be worth buying for the full price...It's basically a simplified version of the spore cell stage but with better graphics, nicer music and more relaxing gameplay"
,Recommended,253650,35510890,Posted: 5 October,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Clicker - FastTLDR: Presents like a life simulation but really is just pellet gobbler in semi open environment.  Concept is short lived and the game has design issues but it is pleasant. Lack of minimap and worse radar than games in this franchise but everything else feels better.Simple game in which you hold mouse1 to swim around and eat pellets, and use mousewhell to change Z level and eat more pellets. Play casual mode and go on an easter egg for pellets of certain colors. Competitive mode has other fishes that eat pellets as well making it a race against the clock. The game is eye catching and somewhat immersive but gets disorienting and repetitive with underdevelopped concepts. Lacks the feeling of a living breathing ecosystem that you survive in, and just feels like a reskinned pellet eating arcade game with design issues. You would probably be better off playing Spore or Insaniquarium. But this is probably the best entry in this series so if you are going to keep one, it might as well be this one."
