76561198053438603,Recommended,253670,11552589,"Posted: 4 August, 2014",all,southpawami,"Reasons to like Curvy:1- Can I run it?  Yep... Curvy runs on nearly anything, doesn't even need a separate graphics card.  Desktop, Laptop, Windows Pro Tablet... it doesn't matter (This benefit probably requires the UI to be barebones.)2- What are licensing restrictions?  None.  Short of trying to sell Curvy's code, UI, or pictures associated with it... the License is quite friendly.  If you can make money commercially with Curvy, then do it.  There's no cap limitations.3- It has a Wine option for Linux users4- It has increasing and decreasing geometry tools in fractions.(update: this seems to be percents now)5- It is the only 3D program that is ready for 3d work in 4 seconds on my laptopReasons not to like Curvy:1- You don't own a tablet2- You can't draw well enough that other people know what you are drawing3- You wouldn't watch videos on how to use this software unless it would keep a zombie apocalypse at bay.4- You don't like drawing living things5- You are entirely unwilling to learn the 1 to 4 line(s) lathe first, magic glue second, sculpt third workflow and instead figure, I'll just use it like sculptris. (this is called throwing efficiency out of the window... of a 20 story building.)* a 64 bit version is now included, so the million count issues should be a thing of the past.Things to Know:1- Curvy has redraw options.  You know you shouldn't draw with that mouse, but you wish there was some forgiveness?  Well, select your mess of a line and pick the redraw option that you want.  No keyboard shortcuts for this.2- There's 32 layers available.3- Scale your geometry down before importing... Curvy likes a certain size range"

Very amazing software. I reccommend BIG YES!

Due to the nature of the program there wasn't much help from other users out there, however after posting on the Steam Forum the Developer gave me some help. Unfortunately the program still failed to launch after which the developer sent me vie e-mail a none Steam version and it worlds great. All this withing 24 hours of purchase. If other companies had customer service this quick and friendly the industry would be a better place!"
,Recommended,253670,20314522,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,Dralger,"I am definitely a fan of this 3D asset creation software.  It is like a more powerful version of Sculptris that can actually handle editing models made elsewhere as well.This is something (along with a seemingly natural companion of Silo 2) that really helped save my interest in learning to create and work with 3D models.  Many other suites are insanely overwhelming to get started with, such as the admirable but frustrating for many Blender.  Curvy is fast, you can start creating and manipulating shapes immediately without even studying up, even for a total first time user.As I've progressed, learned about the pipelines and purchased far more expensive programs - I find myself still using Curvy.  It really is great for fast organic shaped model creation.  The ability to sketch a 2D shape and have it pop into 3D is fairly handy.  Surprisingly I also find myself using it as a sculpting tool for models I've created elsewhere as well.  Sure it is not Zbrush or Mudbox or even 3D Coat, but for my purposes as an indie game dev (working within the constraints of multiple platforms) those programs are total overkill anyway.  The power they provide (I do own 3D Coat) requires too much time investment to make it worth it to me and even if utilized, would be fairly wasted somewhere like Unity where a single mesh is limited to 65k polys (unless you are ok with it being chopped into parts like perhaps a static prop).The one thing I really wish Curvy could do is import and edit 3D models in FBX file format.  This would allow me to work on models that have already been rigged (for this I must use 3D Coat).  However I find Curvy worth using in the early prototype stages of all my models even still.There are some tricks to learn, such as the fact that importing an OBJ will collapse all of the 'subparts' into a single mesh listed in the scene... however this can be easily 'exploded' into all the parts it was built with in some other program through a menu option.All in all I think this software would be good for anyone looking to enter the 3D creation world, and probably a very fun quick prototyping tool for anyone that is already familiar with 3D assets.PS - It seems like all the negative reviews are from people misusing this software - trying to use the sketching like it is CAD or trying to create hardedge extrusion styled models.  As long as you understand what Curvy is and need the functionality, I think you'll be happy."

I just bought this though, mainly because on the forums when I was asking questions about this program and curious as to whether it would be a good buy, the developer immediately responded to me concerning my interests.  He continued to communicate when I had more questions.  So i bought this immediately, knowing that the developers are actually invested in their product -- unlike some things on Steam *ahem* Godmode *ahem*...Between the website and the program itself, you are offered all the info you'll need to start learning how to sculpt/model, or so it seems.  I'm a complete noob and excited to learn."

Challenging to say the leastbut decent results can be had with patience.I've had the program since 1.0 but just todaygot back into it.  Be sure to save often though becauseit does crash every now and then.
76561198001986506,Recommended,253670,13993586,"Posted: 15 January, 2015",all,TheStarBstard,i think this is a good for modeling but you will need to give your self time to learn all the tricks and most new designers fail at that. (i did and most of my friends that have this softwere) now after some time i have started to use this again and if you go over some tutorials and videos then this turns into an awesome tool to help you with what ever you are working on

It has become an inferior product compared to the free program Sculptris in ALL ways.  Examples include: curvy constantly crashes; curvy doesn't recover lost sessions like Sculptris;  the ""Sub"" and ""Deflate"" tools in Curvy constantly create artifacts and what I can only describe as negative volume, which is something I can't even replicate in Sculptris;  reducing mesh is a series of (generally system crashing) menu actions in curvy, yet a simple tool in Sculptris; et cetera.Also, if you're like me and you were reading the curvy 2.0 tutorials, you may be under the false impression that curvy 3.0 can rig one's creations.  This is not the case.  Rigging was removed from this ""advanced"" version, so whether you use the free program Sculptris, the free program Blender, or the HUNDRED-DOLLAR program Curvy, you gotta rig it in Blender.If what you NEED is easy in program rigging, then I'm sorry to say, you need an Adobe subscription."

This is the difference between Aartform Curvy and most of the big names in 3D modeling and animation.  Aartform Curvy puts the fun into modeling,,,I HIGHLY recommend this program whether you are a seasoned professional or a beginner; Aarform Curvy is easy to use and creates beautiful, complex biomorphic shapes that are more like brush strokes than a series of numbers ticked in on a keyboard.Curvy is a wonderful extra tool to have in your toolbox5 THUMBS UP simply for making modeling simple and quick, intuitive and enjoyable for the first time...P.S. You can always import these models into other programs and get all ""tweeky"" on them if you have to satisfy the Geek that exists in most of us..."

It might be a little hard to use, but the tutorial in the video section helps out a lot on the basics. One thing I really like about the program is it doesn't bombard you with a lot of popups like most 3d model production software of its kind, which leaves you with a very clean environment to work with."

AND ALL MODELS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH IN POLYGONS WITH NO ABILITY TO REDUCE THEM. i export to maya and reduce polygons but beyond 20% the mesh is distorted beyond recognition. NO REDO FUNCTION, you have 10 steps back and accidentaly do 11, WELL YOU HAVE TO  REPEAT THAT 11th step. Considering both sculptris and blender ARE FREE im glad i only paid 25% of the retail price because im am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO unhappy with this product.

I use it to repair difficult to find holes and make models ready for printing. It has succeeded at repairing models that even Meshlab could not load. Painting displacement on the models has made detailing fun and easy. Check out the amazing videos for tutorials on youtube. You will be very happy buying this program. :)
