,Recommended,253690,8013061,"Posted: 11 December, 2013",all,Xanabanana,"Tiny Brains is an excellent co-op puzzle game that I think anyone can enjoy. It's not portal, but it's still an excellent game, what really makes this game shine is when you play it with a bunch of friends- and that's the point. If you're going to solo play this, I think your time is better spent, but as a co-op game its definitely a great experience to test friendships working out puzzles, since each person is handed a single tool in your toolkit.My only complaint about the game is that I wish there were more puzzles, DLC is likely in the future, but even so when my friends and I did our first playthrough it only took us 90 minutes- there are some challenge modes, which are definitely great to extend it's lifetime, as let me tell you, working together with 3 other people to keep the ball on the endless rotating pillar is pretty exhillarting and full of suspense, and when you do fail you just try to do it better again.Finally, I will say this, the game is available on the PS4, and if you have one I would reccomend you get this game for the PS4 instead. The game's strength is as a couch co-op/party game. Its easy to play, it's kid friendly (if you're wondering) and the single player mode just honestly doesn't bring the same entertainment playing it with friends is. As of this moment, I think this is the best party game to get for a PS4, definitely something to grab if you were looking for a reason to invite your buddies over to play your PS4 with you."

,Recommended,253690,18057421,"Posted: 16 September, 2015",all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Overall, this is a fun little romp when you have 3 or 4 local couch co-op players available.In my opinion, there is some wasted potential here, but it works.Tiny Brainsboils down to giving each player a very specific 'power' which they can then work as a group to solve puzzles. In general, the puzzles are trying to get out of a single room (move the 'key' to the slot kind of thing). The theme is science.It could be better executed, but because this is such a niche genre (4 player puzzle solving) it gets a pass.I hate saying that.In general I think it suffers from some blandness that often is associated with AAA titles.Although I have no idea what the budget was for this game - there were many people in the credits.Try the demo - it is a decent length.Pros:+Science theme is cool enough+Controls work fine+Puzzles have a medium difficulty - could have been more difficult IMO, but it was fineCons:-Some levels have fighting elements which I would rather do without - just stick to the puzzles-Voice over is real meh-Graphics are bland, needed someone to make stronger artistic decisions, IMO-Better in short play sessions to keep it from feeling repetitive-I know this sounds really silly and picky - but it bothered me when all the people in the credits had the Dr. title - I know its in the theme, but it just bothers meIts a steal if you can get it on a sale.

Amongst all of the similar platformers and shooters and everything in between, this game somehow manages to bring back that hilarity that we so enjoyed on a snow day at a friend's house. It can be played alone, but the game really does shine when you are playing with others. If you can't do local or friends (which is preferred, you won't want to miss those moments), you can still play with others online, and it is simply a blast. The characters are lovable and zany, and the story completely out of left field, as to be expected from indie publishers. The game has a few kinks that need to be ironed out, and the story is quite short, but the challenges and extra modes don't get old when you play with friends - it's an overall very positive experience. 8/10P.S: Beat the Jules mode to get the best achievement to ever grace our mortal kind!"

This game falls somewhere in the middle for me but I'm gonna round down. It's not a bad game in any sense that it's buggy or has real ""issues"" (although I read online coop is broken, haven't tried it). But it's really short and the puzzles just aren't really challenging at all. I played local coop with 3 others of varying ""gaming"" skills and we still breezed through it without scratching our heads but maybe once. And the script is annoyingly un-funny as well. If it's less than $5 then maybe give it a shot but otherwise don't waste your money."

,Not Recommended,253690,13412264,"Posted: 16 December, 2014",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"Tiny Brains wants to treat you like its minuscule rodent protagonists.A coop focused puzzle game, you play as one of four furballs who through some bizarre experiment have been given superpowers and are now naturally stuck running through tests to deduce just how intelligent they've become. Where Spearhead takes this so far however is in seemingly forgetting to design its puzzles as anything requiring involved thought or clever utilization of its awkwardly implemented mechanics.There's this feeling throughout playing Tiny Brains like you're running on a treadmill through the tutorial for all of its four very brief levels. It reuses the same puzzle types, repeats similar level designs, and never gets around to taking the training wheels off. You're a rat in a maze doing the same things again and again. And that's really boring.More frustrating still is how poorly it makes use of its coop component. It's very clearly the way Tiny Brains was designed to play, but puzzles rarely requires the use of more than one or two different powers, essentially meaning if you're playing a full game of four you'll be trading off who gets to actually do anything instead of using your combined efforts to progress. It's at this point that you're probably asking why you wouldn't simply play solo, and the answer to that lies in the aggravating handful of levels that make playing solo immensely difficult or downright impossible. I'm fairly certain I cheated through several of the last levels as there didn't seem any way to possibly get through them without the help of more players, and at one point was attempting to use two controllers simultaneously to get past what was still a very rudimentary puzzle.And then there are all the portions which don't center around puzzle solving at all, but instead rolling a giant ball through an obstacle course or protecting a little pink chick from a horde of rampaging chickens. These are without question the worst parts of an already miserable game, and besides being terribly boring are often obnoxiously difficult because of the poor controls and annoying cooldown timer. These portions probably take up about a third of the game, which is only an hour or two long to begin with. I'd take a moment here to write a bit more about how the before mention pink chick, ostensibly the sole female character in the game, is used solely as a victim and a villain and feels just a little sinister and problematic, but the dialogue is so cringe inducing and the narrative flimsy that there's hardly any point.Everything just comes together like a giant mess of bad design, not helped by the abundant technical issues (as of this writing online coop is all but entirely broken, and even playing solo I experienced crashes after every chapter). I love what Tiny Brains was going for with a coop puzzle game with some unusual means with which to solve them, but it fumbles the whole way and never does anything with its concepts that it just wants to keep introducing over and over. Getting through Tiny Brains would have been a chore even had it worked as intended, but the sort of disrepair its in just makes it sad and embarrassing, and I feel a little bad for having made others play it with it."

You have a short story mode (2.5 hours) and then you can do some puzzles and other things.  I played coop and had a great time.  My friend lives overseas and we did experience some lag for the person not hosting.

Collision detection is clunky and you get stuck more often than not when it comes to jumping. Some of the harder puzzles are not more complex, but involve frustrating trial and error and ""redo the sequence until you get every part of it right"". I think the game would be challenging for kids and entertaining as a family game, but I do not recommend it as  casual puzzle game."

Probably the best way to play it and get the most fun of it, is to play it full 4 player co-op. That way four different people will get four different characters with four different powers. Having 2 player co-op or 3 player co-op leaves somebody to switch characters with different powers on the go, which could be problematic and frustrating.To the game's credit, it is possible to fully pass the game in 2 or 3 player co-op. But that leads to my other problem with the game - it's short. Really short.About 2,5 - 3 hours of gameplay.The humor is fine and cheeky.

I can not imagine playing it alone, so make sure you have someone with you, as the game is not just for two players, it is pretty much only enjoyable this way.Anyway, you control four mice that have unique powers(Push, Suck, Switch-positions, and Freezing) and all their powers combine to help you get through the increasingly harder levels. The game has a cute look and the puzzles are usually quite satisfying to solve.However, the game does lean towards being very rage-inducing. Some of the puzzles involve keeping a little critter alive while it is being attacked by waves on enemies. It's not fun and can drive just about anyone made. Other puzzles involve pushing a ball through a complicated hole-filled maze. They are not fun, either.The majority of the puzzles, though, are wonderful little rooms(think of Portal) that require solving something in order to open the exit. These are all great and a lot of fun to solve with a friend. If they make a sequel, they should focus on these kind of puzzles exclusively.Room puzzles - 8/10Non-room puzzles - 4/10Overall, this game is worth 6/10 to me."
,Recommended,253690,8570841,"Posted: 5 January, 2014",all,Sintag,"This is a weird game.  Let's get that out of the way first.  Tiny Brains is a fun little romp, created by indie startup Spearhead Games.  These guys made, easily, one of the funniest little bits of gaming I've ever seen in recent memory.  That being said, Tiny Brains does miscalculate at points and occasionally it feels like you already went through something.  Bear with me here.First, let's talk gameplay.You play as one of four superpowered rodents (Technically five, although I'm not divulging due to spoilers), which all have a unique, physics-bending, power.  One can pull stuff in, another can create a block of ice which can either act as a trampoline or wall, or can be affected by the other Brains' powers, another shoves stuff away, and another swaps places with some object, BUT cannot affect the Brains themselves.  The game is, put bluntly, a puzzler.  You need to combine and conquer with powers, using two, three, sometimes all four at once just to get past a puzzle.  It's a devious piece of work - At times I was forced to take a step back, re-analyze my strategy, and then adapt to whatever I was coming up on.That's the good news of gameplay.  The bad news?The Brains, for starters, move a tad bit too slow.  It's not a HUGE issue, but in some cases, it does glare right through, most notably in the challenge mode.  Also, unfortunatly for the poor install base (I think it's small), this game was MEANT to be a co-op game, and playing single-player can sometimes feel less like a game and more an exercise in how to non-standardize puzzles.  It's still OK, but friends = Good.Now, for the graphics.  They're...Weird.  This game was meant to be a PS4 release title, but it got shoved back some.  The graphics themselves are cartoony fun, mixed with horrifically dark themes.  It makes for an oddball experience, oftentimes completely clashing with it's silly premise.The game itself takes, at best, two and a half hours to complete, more if you want to see everything ever.  This game is good fun, but I'd get it on a sale - 20$ seems a little too much an asking price for a package this tiny (Heh).Overall, I'd buy Tiny Brains.  And so should you."
,Recommended,253690,8465121,"Posted: 31 December, 2013",all,Keroki,"A brief but memorable experience. Tiny Brains is a commendable attempt at creating a unique co-operative multiplayer experience that can be enjoyed in a single play session. The controls and concepts are straight forward enough for less experienced players to succeed, while still presenting an entertaining challenge to gaming veterans. It's a great title to play with a few friends on Steam Big Picture for an enjoyable evening of collaborative physics-based puzzle solving.Some areas of the game can be difficult to execute and may try your patience, but conquering these sections is bolstered by a wonderful feeling of group accomplishment.Tiny Brains is easy to recommend to anyone looking for a fun and unique title to explore with family or a few friends. With any luck more developers will take chances on games like Tiny Brains."

I don't recommend playing this in co-op with the in-game feature to play with random players: every player that ended up in our game caused intermittent random lag spikes.Replayability comes in the form of competitive game modes where you try to move the ball as far through a level, or play the campaign in hardcore mode where you only have 1 life available.The campaign is a bit short: even if you take it slow you'll finish it within one or several hours. Nonetheless still sort of a bargain for € 2.99. For solo play it might be a bit underwhelming."
