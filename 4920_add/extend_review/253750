76561198144486490,Recommended,253750,17900795,"Posted: 5 September, 2015",all,MEAT GOD,"Ikaruga is a harsh mistress. She is a love you cannot conquer, she is a complex beauty who demands perfection. Your best will never truly please her, she will make you feel inadequate at every moment, and yet you cannot stop trying to win her heart. When you are with her, any mistake you make will sting a thousand times worse. And she will make you furious, she will make you cry, she will drive you crazy, but you cannot stop loving her, because there is nothing else in the world that can compare to what she is.Pros:- She is perfection.Cons:- You are not.Other thoughts:- achievements are not broken down to different game play modes (easy/normal/hard/prototype mode). Also, Dot Eater is not linked to any level, you can get it in any mode.- extra ""double play"" game modes not found in the console version.- almost every combination of screen rotations are supported, which is great. It looks incredible on a pivot monitor.- the game select at the start does not show the player character anymore (it uses the high score screen background instead)- no training mode options to restart a level (you will need this a lot), or to start mid-level (GCN version had this I believe).- to unlock a level on any difficulty, you just have to credit feed the game on easy mode. This also gets you the achievements for beating a boss. On the Dreamcast, you could only use training on levels you managed to reach with 1 credit, on the specific difficulty you reached it with.- you cannot define analog axes as buttons, so on a non-xbox pad you may not be able to configure a trigger for the laser release. But the game supports just about any non-xinput pad other than this, which is great.- when using level select to play the Final stage, the Stone-Like sequence is omitted! Boo!- Downloaded replays tend to desync more often than not, what is up with that?- tip: some levels are easier to get S++ score on with prototype mode.- where's Radiant Silvergun?"

I still feel like nobody ever quite explained it as well as Greg Kasavin did, so here's his review.  Notice this is the GameCube version he's reviewing, and all versions have very slight differences, but the XBLA version added the most ""features"" so to speak, and that's mainly what we got with this version.  It fixed a lot of things the XBLA port got wrong from the arcade and DC/GC versions.  My only nitpick is, they didn't include online co-op which the 360 version had, which hopefully they'll patch in at a later date.  And there are people who have latency issues with the game at the moment so hopefully that's fixed fast.  I also really hope Treasure VAC protects the game at some point as well.  Another sad thing I guess is, the previously announced Trading Cards are now no longer happening, apparantly, the store page isn't even listing them anymore even though Treasure themselves confirmed them...So, best review of the game ever -http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4fzFvQzWtwGo buy it!Edit - Has Steam cards now, just to be clear and updated."
,Recommended,253750,9170148,"Posted: 18 February, 2014",all,ジャック,"As bullet hell shooters go, there isn't one as excellently realized as Ikaruga is. In this one, you are able to freely change the polarity of your ship between light and dark. Doing so allows you to absorb enemy attacks of the same color as you, and do additional damage to enemies of the opposite color. Destroying an enemy of the same color as you will produce suicide bullets (which you will either need to avoid or absorb). Absorbing shots charges a special attack, which once activated, sends a volley of polarized missiles across the screen.This polarity mechanic takes a shooter that would have been excellent on its own, and makes it so much more.If you're at all a fan of this particular genre of shooter, and haven't played Ikaruga, this is an excellent version of the game to play it for the first time. It lacks the online multiplayer which was found in the Xbox Live Arcade version, but is 5 bucks cheaper (and seeing how the XBL coop was a laggy mess, it isn't a huge deal for it to be missing here.)What's added in this version is the ability to solo man two ships (if you think the game is a cakewalk as it is or something), local multiplayer support, as well as numerous screen rotation options.It's a great version of what is quite possibly one of the best video games ever made! What're you waiting for?!"

,Recommended,253750,9404218,"Posted: 9 March, 2014",all,Squire Grooktook,"Probably one of the most ubiquitous shmups released since 2000. If you like oldschool games and ever owned a Dreamcast, Gamecube, or Xbox 360, than you've probably heard of this one.Ikaruga's main twist is the polarity system, in which all bullets come in two colors, and your ship can switch between the two colors at will. You die from opposite colored bullets and power up from same colored bullets, as well as deal extra damage to enemies of the opposite color. It's very simple but is a really cool system that adds a lot of depth to the game.The other thing of note about Ikaruga, is that it's a very methodical ""puzzle shooter"" type game. It's very static, and enemies and patterns are often arranged in such a way as to seem like a puzzle to ""figure out"" and deal with correctly. For this reason Ikaruga very much prioritizes pure execution over reflexes.However, even if you're the type of person who prefers games that force reaction and improvisation over static paths and execution (as I count myself), you should still be able to enjoy Ikaruga because...well, it's a damn fun game. The level designs and enemies are varied and creative, the bosses are epic, the pacing is tight, the scoring is deep, and the presentation and music would be worth playing the game for alone.Overall I'd say it's a must play for fans of shmups and 2d games in general. It might not be your favorite shmup ever depending on your tastes and preferences in gameplay design, but it's an excellent game that's well worth experiencing."

,Recommended,253750,9171729,"Posted: 18 February, 2014",all,VestedGamr,"I'll probably end up redoing this review since I haven't played it much...Ikaruga is a bullethell-style shmup with a special polarity mechanic. You can absorb bullets that are the same polarity as your ship and do double damage to enemies that are of the opposite polarity. This game is not for the faint of heart - the volume of bullets rivals that of CAVE's shooters or even Fraxy or Touhou Danmakufu (the latter two being shmups built around player-made bosses).Graphics: Beautiful but dated. The game was original made for arcade units back in 2001, as well as the SEGA dreamcast, and while the polygon count and texture resolution has increased with subsequent releases the lighting quality has not. Also, this game is hard.Soundtrack: One of the best. Epic and driving at the same time. Also, this game is hard.Gameplay: Simplicity is a good thing when it comes to shmups - you want to make the game mechanics as easy to memorize as possible so the player can concentrate on what's on screen. Ikaruga definately delivers in this category. Also, this game is hard.Story: Kinda hard to describe. Think of it as a semi-sequel of Radient Silvergun, in a time loop that deviated from previous loops. Also, this game is hard.Notes: This game has had reports of crashing on startup, however in most cases simply restarting Steam fixes the problem. This game has been previously released on multiple platforms. Also, this game is hard.Breakdown:Graphics: 6/10Soundtrack: 9/10Gameplay: 10/10Story: 6/10Recommended for: People who enjoy very hard games, fans of bullethell games.Not recommended for: People who can't handle losing.Bottom line: An iconic game that is a must-have for any shmup fan.

,Recommended,253750,9176819,"Posted: 18 February, 2014",all,Hobbes,"Oh god. Ikaruga. We meet again. We last danced on the Dreamcast, you and I. I was younger then, my reactions were better, but my mind was less sharp, I had a less refined palette, and so I was not quite able to grasp precisely what you were trying to teach me, in between the chaos and the madness and the screams of ENERGY MAX ringing in my ears every other second.My review, such that it is, is based on a quick loadup to see how it runs and if the port is good, and my experiences based on the game on the original Dreamcast, I doubt there's much else to say given Treasure has done an absolutely stunning job with the port so my opinion needs little modification. Ikaruga is perhaps one of the best known bullet hells among Western Audiences (Cave shooters perhaps more known among the eastern crowd, go look some of them up, particularly Bug Princess 2 if you want to really melt your mind).Ikaruga's selling point was the concept of polarity, in so much as that your ship could flip between ""White"" and ""black"" polarity at any given point, and whatever colour it was, not only was it immune to the respective coloured swarm, it gained energy from it, allowing it to store up, and unleash a mini nuke from the incomming fire.Sheer genius.This game enshrined risk and reward in ways so subtle that months and years later people would sink hundreds, if not thousands of hours dissecting the mechanics and perfecting them, youtube runs of mythical S+++ runs showing scary levels of precision and mind meltingly quick reactions can be unearthed for the brave to boggle at.The level design was pitch perfect both in pacing and in graphical spectacle, constantly keeping you both entertained and at the very edge of your abilities, regardless of your overall skill level, and the sound, whilst hardly far outside the standard fare for such games, has remained very much as atmospheric now as it was then, giving a real tension and emotional background as you plunge further into the realms of the Horai.It runs perfectly and at a rock solid 60fps on the PC, and this port does the game absolute justice, Ikaruga has come home, at last, to the PC.

At first I treated it like any other shooter before I even started learning how to chain combos properly. The combo system is where this game really shines, it turns from a ""shut your brain off and shoot enemies"", to a fast paced twitch puzzle game. I've spent countless hours on the GameCube version of the game and the PC port holds up well. When you get into the groove of the polarity switching and memorize enemy patterns there really is no limit to what you can do next to improve your score.What kept me playing is i never felt like I’ve hit a plateau in what kind of score i could achieve, there is always positive reinforcement to keep playing because you can see what the guy ahead of you on the leaderboard has done... don't go way above your means and watch the number 1 player and think I’ll never be able to do that... watch the guy who's only 2 million points ahead of you and mimic the style he's using... you'll quickly learn that the game that's touted as ""impossibly hard"", is actually very doable to get a high score.I recommend giving it a fair chance turn the BGM off and play some of your own chillout tunes and enter the meditation that is Ikaruga.Pros-very forgiving hitbox often times you feel like ""how did i just survive that?!"", rather than ""oh man how did i die there!?""-mesmerizingly intelligent level scripting.-addictive-intuitive design-perfect integration of the Microsoft controller,  and also very good response when linking a ps3 controller via 3rd party apps.Cons-no longer has slow mo, and training that was included in the GameCube release."

,Recommended,253750,9177353,"Posted: 18 February, 2014",all,MetaWaddleDoo,"Ikaruga is hands-down one of the best shmups to ever be released.  The game achieves the rare feat of appealing to both die-hard shmup fans, as well as those new to the genre.  Although it's not exclusive to Steam, this is easily the best game on the service.The PC port is done exceptionally well.  There are plenty of options to tweak the visuals, controls, sound, and various other settings.  Even on an unoptimal setup, I did not experience any lag.  The only downside is that it seems that only Xbox 360 controllers are supported, but there's plenty of workarounds to make your arcade stick, PS3 controller, or whatever else you have lying around work for this game.As for the game itself, for those unfamiliar, Ikaruga has a unique ""polarity-shifting"" mechanic.  Bullets are either white or black.  You can change your ship to be white or black with a button-press.  Depending on the color of your ship, you can absorb bullets of the same color, and deal more damage to enemies of the opposite color.  The difficulty options only make minor tweaks, but it changes the game immensely.  On hard, all enemies drop ""suicide-bullets"" when they die.  On normal, only enemies that match your color will drop these suicide-bullets.  And on easy, no enemies drop suicide bullets.  Even easy mode is relatively challenging.  However, with enough dedication, any player should be able to complete this game.And what would a shmup be without a fun scoring system?  While Ikaruga may not have my favorite scoring system out there, it's definitely unique and elegant.  Killing three enemies of the same color in a row will add to your chain.  Break this chain anywhere, and you have to start from zero again.  Figuring out the best way to chain through an entire level almost makes this feel like a puzzle game at times.  And even once you've figured out how to chain every enemy together, there's still a few more things to do to boost your score.  Absorbing enemy bullets increases your score, as does defeating bosses quickly.  Sometimes absorbing ONE more bullet or beating a boss ONE second quicker can make just a slight enough difference to push you up in the leaderboards.If you haven't played this game before, please do yourself a favor and purchase it as soon as possible.  Don't wait for a Steam sale.  $10 is a more than reasonable price for what you get out of this game.  Hopefully if enough people vote with their wallets, we'll see Treasure focus their development efforts on PC.  I'd love to see a release of Radiant Silvergun, or better yet: a brand new game from Treasure made exclusively for PC."

,Recommended,253750,9175723,"Posted: 18 February, 2014",all,M_W,"The arcade shoot 'em up (or shmup, as it is called by fans of the genre), has long been known for its generally high level of difficulty and, in a similar manner to two-dimensional fighting games, a less than graceful aging. Shmups have rarely been known to display a great degree of inventivness; even some of the genre's best offerings adhere to the tried-and-true forumula of ""dodge bullets, shoot ships."" While there are a number of exceptions to the rule, few have kicked the trend harder, and in a more finely crafted fashion, than the beloved Ikaruga, the product of Japanese Developer, Treasure.Originally released to Japanese arcades in late 2001, Ikaruga places the player in the role of the titular aircraft, capable of switching at will between two ""polarities,"" black and white, to enable it to absorb bullets of like color, which will be one of the two previously mentioned. As well, enemy craft will be vulnurable to any of the Ikaruga's bullets which do not match their own. One final addition to the Ikaruga's aresenal is the homing attack, the meter for which is charged by absorbing bullets, and releases a powerful salvo of seeking projectiles proportionally powerful to how full the charge meter is.These mechanics alone would make for an interesting game even if the level design was relatively straightforward; however, each level is designed with an attention to detail and care rarely seen in games of any genre. Each stage, progressively harder than the next, plays as much like a puzzle game as it does a shoot 'em up, and watching replays of some of the world's top players will quickly inform you that there is definitely more than one way to win.But no high-quality shmup would be complete without a fun and robust scoring system, and Ikaruga has one which not only changes the way you play, but can actually make gameplay more fun while doing it. Skilled players can ""chain"" enemies together, by destroying three consecutive ships of the same color, each chain in addition to the first offering a massive bonus in points, getting you closer to your desired score, and the additional lives at each extend point.This game is pretty easy on the eyes, too. All of the mechanical designs present in Ikaruga have a uniquely Japanese, mythic, fantasy/science fiction look to them, all of which come together to make the game feel epic and larger-than-life, with much help from it's memorable sythesized orchestral soundtrack.In Ikaruga's long history, Treasure have released the game for a number of platforms, and in each iteration, all the way up to the port for Xbox Live Arcade, provided additional options to improve the overall experience, and the Steam release is no exception. Inlucuded in this already smooth port of the original are leaderboards, acheivements, multiplayer, stage select, prototype mode (which is available from the start, unlike in previous releases), and even the ability to play two-player mode solo, using each of the thumsticks to control each ship.Oh, yeah, the best part? All runs in beautiful 60 frames per second, just like we're used to.If there is one thing in Ikaruga that plays to it's detriment, it would be the same thing that has drawn so many hardcore fans to it in the first place: the difficulty. Ikaruga is by no means an easy game; even on the lowest difficulty, it will provide an almost insurmountable challenge for many newcomers, with the remaining settings, and the inclusion of prototype mode, only getting harder from there. Those looking for a relaxing experience will want to look elsewhere. That being said, overcoming the many obstacles ahead of the player prove to be incredibly rewarding, and repeat playthroughs offer more ways to play with improving skill.Treasure have hit it out of the park with this release. If you already own Ikaruga on XBLA, the additional features may not be enough to justify a re-purchase (unless you're crazy in love with Treasure like I am), but if you're looking to get those online leaderboards, replays, and flexibility absent from previous releases, or you are new to the game and want to see what all the fuss is about, you could certainly do worse than picking it up on Steam."

Nah, not at all. There may be even more crazy shmups than this (and all of them seem to come from asia ... I see a pattern here), but if you have nerves of steel, want to gain nerves of steel or just have masochistic tendencies in general (it has a 2 player mode, so a sorrow shared is a sorrow halved I guess), Ikaruga is a must have.

If you're looking for a review about Ikaruga as a game, look elsewhere, there are mountains of praise and critique written about this game throughout the 13 years it has existed on this planet.The Steam version is essentially the X360 (and NESiCAxLIVE) version with a few tweaks. You get HD graphics, online leaderboards, downloadable replays, etc. Some of the timing issues that the X360 version had have been fixed here, making this version a LOT more accurate to the NAOMI/Dreamcast verion. In the DC version, I listen to musical cues to know when to burst, change, etc. Couldn't do that in the X360 version.Treasure decided to enhance the HUD a little bit here. Now, you have a counter showing you how much burst energy you have, and the score is divided with commas. Both of these enhancements are quite welcome, I've found myself using the burst energy counter quite a few times, and commas plus big numbers are never a bad thing.One thing I'm quite angry about that Treasure could've easily added here, is the lack of a quick restart option. Just like the X360 version, if you're practicing a stage and want to restart because you messed up, you have to quit the stage, go back to the main menu, and reselect the stage all over again. It doesn't help that the game mode select screen uses these ""cinematic"" transitions which only adds more unnecessary time to a practice session. It would be nice if Treasure could add a restart option to the pause menu. Or better yet, bring back the Conquest mode from the Gamecube version!Also, like the X360 version, you can't practice the very last boss, wherein you have to dodge some very complex patterns for 60 seconds. Way to alienate the new generations of players who might want to become masters at this game, Treasure.These practice-related complaints aside, overall this version is a very nice packaging of a wonderful game. I applaud Yasushi Suzuki for coming back after 13+ years and adding some brand-new artwork for the main menu. The presentation far outdoes the X360 version (if you can't tell, I quite detest the X360 version).As a player who has a lot of experience with the older versions, should you buy this version of Ikaruga? Even though I've memorized basically every pixel movement with the Dreamcast version, I certainly don't regret buying this version. It's been fun seeing how high I can get on the global leaderboard (I'm a bit rusty, yet I'm already in the top 80), plus I kinda like the idea that my Steam friends can see my achievements and know what an ELITE SHMUP PLAYER I am. =P Also, I only have the stock controllers for my Dreamcast, so this is the first time I've been able to use an arcade stick with this game. Now, I can feel extra confident about kicking this game's butt in a real Japanese arcade.As for new players? Just try out the demo, or read one of the thousands of reviews that are out there. Just know that there are very strong, opposing opinions about this game, inside and outside of the shmup community. You will either love or hate Ikaruga."

Mastering a level could be compared, at least superficially, to learning a song – at the very least, the game’s constant forward crawl and emphasis on perfect timing on a succession of coloured marks shares a lot with the typical rhythm game.But this only really explains the long tail of the experience. For all the zen-like, dot-eating mastery that you’ll strive for in the long term, Ikaruga’s early appeal is sustained remarkably effectively by the base elements of gaming that we’re often so quick to dismiss. Developed for the now antique hardware shared by the Dreamcast and Naomi arcade board, Ikaruga isn’t exactly pumping polygons, but it still looks fantastic.This world of elaborate black and white mecha – always accented by reds and blues respectively – is an alluring invention. The art design gives us a unique science fiction world that is more inventive and arresting than the worlds spun out of a long list of triple-A miscellany. The music is rousing, building to some strangely affecting moments near the tail end of the game. The sound effects are pitch perfect, whether digitally screaming at you on a boss approach or punctuating your deft control with explosions and that impossibly unrepetitious chorus of ‘MAX CHAIN, MAX CHAIN, MAX CHAIN’.[...]Don’t disqualify yourself from playing this game. You’re probably never going to be someone who can completethe entire game on a single credit playing as both ships, but there’s so much more fun to be had at the shallow end of play than you’d think at first glance. 50 to 5,000 hours of fun, in fact."

,Recommended,253750,33289675,Posted: 5 July,all,Finley,"This isn't so much an arcade shoot 'em up as a high intensity puzzle game. The primary aim is to survive each level by avoiding bullets of the opposite polarity to your ship - for example if your polarity is white, your ship is invulnerable to white bullets, but contact with a black bullet will kill you.The secondary aim is to maximise your score by 'chaining' enemy kills by polarity, i.e. destroying enemies of the same polarity in groups of three. Each chain increases your score multiplier - which affects the points awarded by each individual kill - by a factor of one. The higher your score, the higher your grade at the end of each level. The highest grades can only be achieved with very high score multipliers.Alternatively you can complete each level without firing once by avoiding bullets of the opposite polarity until the timer reaches zero. You're awarded with a special grade and ranking on a separate leaderboard.The layout of enemies and their bullet patterns is identical each playthrough, and therefore repeated attempts are the key to success. Memorise enemy patterns, identify how to continuously chain enemy kills, and ultimately become good enough to complete the game in a single credit!A full playthrough tales approximately 25 minutes, but it will take many hours of practice before this can be achieved with just three lives.Ikaruga expects you to die over and over again, but persevere and youwillprogress.

I will probably never beat it but even attempting the first 2 levels over and over again has been more fun than you'd expect.It's a bullet hell (meaning there is a ton of bullets on screen and you're expected to dodge them all) but mixed with a polarity-swapping technique. Enemies are of 2 colors, and you have the ability to be 1 of the 2 colors at a time. You absorb bullets of the same polarity and die to bullets of the opposite. You shoot the same color as your polarity, and shooting enemies with matching polarity does double damage. Shooting the correct polarity across multiple enemies rewards you with a chain, which leads to a higher score (which is the point of this game).It's one of the hardest games I've played, and this is supposedly not even nearly as hard as other games in the genre. If you like a challenge you will certainly find it in this game. I don't think anyone with any amount of gaming experience can just pick up this game and get to level 5 even within a few days. It takes lots of practice and memorization and on top of all that perfect execution to proceed through the entirety of the game.The level design is basically art. It's amazing how they've used the polarity technique to actually generate level obstacles that, in tandem with the spawning enemies, create an entire level that you're expected to dodge and blow up while maintaining a combo and getting the highest score possible. You can tell a lot of work went into the precise timings and enemy types of enemy spawns. The bosses are very unique and well designed as well. You almost never feel like they've repeated anything in the game. Every 5 seconds you're facing something new.This game is easily a 9/10, more or less depending on your individual taste for bullet hells."

This is game was also released to Xbox Live in 2011. then Steam port was released in February 18, 2014.This game doesn't really feature power-ups, but it features a unique mechanic in exchange.

The levels are really well-made and the music is really amazing in my opinion. The graphics are really good for this year. The Steam port of Ikarugua has gamepad support. I tested this game with a Xbox One controller, and it works pretty well. I'm not sure if this works with any gamepad other than a Xbox One controller, so can anyone please confirm it? The controls were very reponsive and stiff.Just because this game is really good, that doesn't mean it has its flaws. One of the issues I have about this game is the story seems non-existent.

There are also enemies that can be either of the two types (or both), that you must kill and avoid their bullets and path.  Within a polarity, you are able to collect (eat) bullets of the same polarity/energy type from a matching enemy, and use that gathered energy to unleash homing missiles.  Keep in mind though, that to shoot an enemy with an opposing energy/polarity color does Twice as much damage to them, but will often leave you having to dodge heavier fire as the sacrifice.Aside from purely awesome gamplay both the graphics and the soundtrack are gorgeous as well, and will definitely leave you remembering the visuals, animations and experience.If you're looking for a shooter that will push you to your limits.. this is for sure the game to get!

That being said, you need to use a 360 controller emulator in order to make the game even recognize a different type of controller as the mouse and keyboard approach is odd for this type of game.

It's very tough but also very rewarding with its dual phase mechanic. If your ship is black, you absorb black bullets and die in one hit. If you're white, it's the opposite.

Unless you enable Free Play, of course. I first played this game on the Gamecube back in the day and I still haven't beaten it.This port bears more similarity to the not-so-recent XBLA port, as it contains many of the same trappings, albeit with a few more options, such as the aforementioned Free Play option. However, as with the XBLA version, any deviation from the game's default settings renders high scores invalid, although unlike the XBLA port, achievements can still be earned. As someone who is a fan of bullet-hell but by no means a god, this is a little frustrating as it would have been nice if the game had local hi-scores independent of the game settings and online leaderboards.As for the game itself, it remains unchanged. Dodge the opposite-coloured bullets while absorbing the same-coloured ones. This adds a real element of strategy to the game and makes for some truly daunting bullet patterns. Add in the chaining mechanic, where destroying only enemies of a single colour result in massive points bonuses and you'll find yourself dying a lot - partly because of the mind-bending difficulty and partly because of human greed, but crucially, you'll always blame yourself, not the game.If you like your scrolling shooters with a bit of thought to them, you can't go far wrong with this.

What makes Ikaruga stand out compared to other Danmaku shooters is that it has a polarity system that allows the player to change their ship to black and white. When you are in white polarity the player can absorb white bullets and deal more damage to black polarity enemies. If you're ship is black polarity you can absorb black bullets and deal more damage to white polarity enemies. The game also features a complex scoring system called chaining. To get a chain you must shoot 3 enemies of the same polairty, if at any point you shoot a different colored enemy without completing a chain it will be broken and the chain multiplier will reset. While this isn't important for survival breaking your chain is detrimental to achieving high scores.Ikaruga as it is an arcade game isn't very story driven. However, the player assumes the role of a Tenkaku Pilot name Shinra who is nearly killed when his ship is shot down by an enemy force called the Horai. Shinra's plane crashes near a small village named Ikaruga. Being the sole survivor of his squadron he is pulled from the wreckage and nursed back to health. After Shinra was nursed back to health Shinra pledged to defeat the Horai, and the villagers entrusted him with a top-secret fighter plane that they had constructed called the Ikaruga. The Ikaruga was no ordinary ship, it was the only ship of it's kind to integrate both energy polarities and being capable to interchangably change polarities of the Horai ships.Having over 100 hours of experience with this game spanning across the Dreamcast, Gamecube, and Xbox 360 versions the PC Ikaruga port is without a doubt the definitive version of the game. The game has never looked soo clean with HD visuals and Anti-Aliasing, It has also fixed the issues the Xbox 360 version of the game had as well. If you've never played this game before and want something challenging that has high-replay value this is the game for you. If you're someone who likes to credit feed a game and once they're done never go back to it then I can't recommend this game as it is only 5 stages long and if you credit feed through the game it can easily be beaten in 30 minutes.*update*Games is on sale for $4.99 pick it up while it's cheap"

But if you want, you can enable continues from the options menu to make it easier.In addition to the usual mechanics in shoot'em up games, this game features ((Polarity)) mechanic. Your ship has two forms/colors (blue and red) and by switching between them, you can avoid being hit by the projectiles that have the same color and absorb them to unleash a powerful attack (blue form/color absorbs blue projectiles and red form/color absorbs red projectiles).By killing 3 enemies of the same color in a row, you get one ((Chain)) bonus that resets if you kill enemies without using the said pattern. Earning chains is very important if you want to get high scores and grades (and also achievements) at the end of each level; but it can also become very hard in final levels.Pros:- Challenging Gameplay- Amazing Soundtracks- Co-Op Support- Polarity MechanicCons:- Nothing"

76561198101453313,Not Recommended,253750,16950572,"Posted: 8 July, 2015",all,Mreitsma,"I really wanted to like this game, I really did. usually I like bullet hell games quite a bit, but this one didn't sit well with me. It's got a lot of problems; some of them are subjective and some people may consider them to actually be strengths, but there are others that no-one in their right mind would think to be good unless they are a blind fanboy.Obviously, this is going to be a negative review, so let's start out with the positives. The graphics look pretty nice. Controller support is (mostly) very good. The polarity switching mechanic is... interesting... for the first five minutes of the game.To start off the negatives, let's expand on some of the positives. When I say controller support is mostly good, I mean that it's excellent, save for one thing. Like in most bullet hell games, you have the ability to move at a slower speed, if you desire to. The problem is, the only way to activate this slow speed is to only tilt the analog stick slightly, rather than holding a button and inputting a direction, like most bullet hell games. This wouldn't be a problem, except it's very difficult to even get the slower speed to activate; the analog stick must be tilted just so for it to work. In a very intense game that is a bullet hell game, monkeying with the analog stick and trying to get it to behave a certain way is an obvious no-no. So, if you use a controller, you will never be moving at the optional slower speed; it simply doesn't work well enough.This brings me to my next issue with the controls. The keyboard controls have issues. Usually I prefer to use a controller when I play video games, but for bullet hell games I prefer to use a keyboard. This doesn't really work with this game. There is no button you can hold to move at a slow speed with a keyboard, so while the option is too poorly implemented on the controller to work well, it doesn't even exist on the keyboard. However, that's small beans compared to a start button not existing on the keyboard. That's right, if you play using a keyboard, you won't be able to use continues. I hope you enjoy 1CCing bullet hell games on your first try if you don't own a controller!This brings me to my next point. The buttons can be remapped to basically whatever you want; if you have a working controller or keyboard, Xinput or no, you can remap the controls. However, as said before, there is no option to remap the start button on the keyboard; it does not exist. I've tried pressing every key on my keyboard to continue when the counter appears, and nothing works. Again, it does not exist. Being able to remap the buttons that DO work is very nice, and the customization is appreciated. Another nice thing is that if you use a controller with Xinput, the button prompts change. It seems weird to me that the control options for this game would be so fleshed out, but that something is vital as a start button is completely missing from the keyboard controls. In conclusion, the control options for the game are mostly really nice but some deep errors were made concerning specific aspects of them, as well.So, you have to use a controller and the slow speed doesn't work well for the controller, big deal, what about the actual game?Let's address that by expanding on another positive; the polarity-switching mechanic is interesting... for a bit. Ikaruga features the ability to change your ""polarity""; being light/blue/whatever-you-want-to-call-it allows you to absorb blue bullets, and being red allows you to absorb red bullets. Absorbing bullets lets you charge up a powerful special attack. Also, shooting bullets at an enemy that is not the same polarity as you will deal significantly more damage.As said before, it's interesting for the first 5 minutes. It's really not a big deal. I could only really see someone that was very starved for creativity enjoying it significantly.The first stage is pretty easy and allows the player to get used to the concept of changing their polarity. I enjoyed it. I noticed at the beginning of each stage, there will be some text that will tell you what stage you are on and say something edgy about overcoming an ordeal. It's completely unnecessary, makes no sense, and is not germane to any story (not that most bullet hell games even have those). Not a huge deal, though. There wasn't really anything special about the boss, but when he explodes, there's gratuitous slowdown; the explosion couldn't possibly cause lag when the rest of the game didn't. While I frown upon that, it's also not a huge deal.The second stage is where I really became disappointed with this game. This is where the subjectivity comes in, and is also my major reason for disliking this game.I ♥♥♥♥ing detest environmental hazards in bullet hell games. Walls, giant rocks, things that serve no purpose but to get in the way. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate them.So obviously, the second stage is where the environmental hazards start to come into play. Probably about half of the stage (maybe a bit more) consists of environmental hazards; large square fans and flying metal objects that don't seem to resemble anything specifically. Navigating the stage was more of a bore than fun. The boss of stage two though... that was the icing on the cake, the cherry on top, yada yada. It was extremely tedious. The boss boxes you into a triangle that is about a third of the screen. To damage the boss, you must shoot these cap things that protect it's weak points. They will expand away from the boss the more that you shoot them, and you must get between the cap and the boss to shoot it's weak point as the cap slowly retracts back to it's original position, all while you dodge bullets. It's extremely tedious. Not only is your movement extremely limited, but even being able to damage the boss is a chore. I've already said it, but the word ""tedious"" really describes this boss very well.So I soldiered through stage two, hoping that stage three would be better... it was even worse. Worse than I could have possibly imagined.  Basically the entire stage is an environmental hazard. The first part of the stage consists of large, moving square blocks that leave you with very little space to maneuver. Unless you watch someone do this part or practice it over and over again, there's no way to know how to maneuver correctly. Stay back or move ahead? Who knows? You'll end up touching one and exploding, unless you know exactly what to do. This introduced something I also dislike, just not as much as environmental hazards: memorization. The next part of the stage is heavy on both; Pillars will extend from the side of the screen. Some will close, some will leave openings. Again, this requires heavy memorization, because you need to know whether to pull ahead or stay back; there's no way to know if they will fully close or stop and leave an opening. Pulling ahead may result in you hitting one of the pillars that left an opening, stay backing may result in you getting trapped behind a closed pillar. I ♥♥♥♥ing hated this part. Luckily, the boss of stage three isn't nearly as tedious as the boss of stage two, just a little plain, but it's a huge improvement. Unfortunately, the achievement for beating him glitched and wasn't awarded to me, so that's nice.I had some lives left after I beat stage three and played a bit of stage four. It didn't impress me, but it seemed to be a lot better than stages two and three. I had no motivation to try again after I lost the rest of my lives fairly early in the stage. There are only five stages, so I figured that I had given this game a fair shake and quit. I proceeded to uninstall it and write this review.I wouldn't even recommend this game to hardcore bullet hell fans. I have no idea why people like it so much."

The concept is still unique; a scrolling shooter with no powerups, no screen-clearing bombs, and brilliant level design which means that sometimes the best way to survive and score highly is not to shoot everything on the screen as quickly and indiscriminately as possible.  This is a game that rewards patience, careful thinking, and the 'twitch' all at once, a game that will humble you for your first few attempts but at the same time leave you saying 'one more go' over and over again.  Ikaruga is not just a great game; it's a milestone in the history of gaming, the very apex of the scrolling shooter, and Treasure's magnum opus among masterpieces, made all the more amazing considering that it was originally designed, developed, and scored by only four people.

Otherwise, please continue reading...For anyone who doesn't know about Ikaruga: It was originally a bullet hell SHMUP released in Japanese arcades, and then released on the Dreamcast in Japan. Stateside, it got an enhanced port to Gamecube and XBLA, and now onto Steam. What followed was a bunch of bloody hands and broken controllers. Okay, maybe not, but that's how hard this game is.By default, this game has no continues. Ever. And if you're not good at chaining your kills, extra lives will be very scarce. Oh, it's possible to earn them, but they're only rewarded to the ones that are actually experts at the game. So if you're a casual player of the genre (or of games in general), you're going to ragequit this game pretty quickly.Alright, let's get to the meat and potatoes of the game: The gameplay. As you can tell from the game's trailer, there's a polarity system, where you dodge opposite colors and absorb matching colors. Absorbing bullets powers up your Energy Bar, which allows you to deal a devestating attack to all enemies on the screen, depending on how much energy you have stored up. Shooting an enemy of the opposite color of what you are deals more damage than of the same color, which aids in helping you clear the screen at a more efficient rate. You also build up a bigger score with chaining your kills; killing three enemies of the same color generates one chain, and can be built up with both colors, but will also be canceled out if you hit an enemy of the opposite color of the current chain you're working on.Is the gameplay solid? Oh, definitely. Maneuvering is a bit slow for my tastes, though it works for this type of game, so I'll give it a pass. The amount of bullets on screen is balanced thanks to the polarity system, and also adds an excellent risk/reward system of which firepower you'll use on your enemies. Chaining is pretty difficult to get the hang of at first, but it adds a layer of strategy for gaining a high score, along with game progression if you need the extra lives. So for once, spamming bullets is actually looked down on. Rather ironic and maybe taboo for the genre, but it truly works.Graphics-wise, it's pretty much the same stuff from every other port out there. But really, they're fine, as is. All that matters the most would the bullets, the color of the enemies, and your ship's polarity. All of that is already nailed, so there you go.Audio-wise, I like the soundtrack. I've heard parts of it before on Youtube, but it's good to be able to hear them in the actual game. And it just helps with the mood of the game, as well.OPTIONS! Oh, TotalBiscuit will be disappointed with no FOV slider and lack of other video options, but face it: It's a game that's been around for over a decade. If your computer is a toaster, it should handle it just fine. But one thing I really like would be the ability to play the game on a vertical display, as how it originally should be. Keep in mind that the full screen mode will be on your first highest-resolution monitor, if you have multiple monitors and plan on using one for playing the game. There are also different ways to set up the HUD, if need be. You can also adjust how many continues/lives you have (warning: No high scores allowed for these changes), along with how often you earn extra lives. This helps if you just want to play through the game entirely without hassle. There's also being able to play the Prototype mode, though I haven't played that yet, so not sure how that goes.If I had to have one gripe with this game, it would be the lack of native gamepad support. This game allows for Xbox 360 controllers, but my Logitech gamepad and Mayflash arcade stick don't work with this game unless I use Joy2Key. Yes, while that works, having native support would be nice.Overall, as a fan of SHMUPs (mostly Gradius), I really like this game. Just know that this game, by default, is really difficult, but a unique take on the genre nonetheless. If you enjoy SHMUPs and/or the bullet hell subgenre, pick this game up. If you're new to the genre, I'd probably go check something else out first, like Jamestown."

Ikaruga is my third favourite shmup of all time (after Gradius V and R-Type). The action is fast and furious with a novel polarity-shift mechanism allowing the player ship to absorb bullets/energy of the polarity which the ship is in at that time. It can be incredibly strategic, hard as nails and often infuriating but you will definitely keep coming back for more.

,Recommended,253750,9196586,"Posted: 20 February, 2014",all,AlucarD,"Story:As we are dealing with an arcade space shooter here there isn't much story implied in these kind of games but anyway I think Ikarugas background story is actually pretty good for a mere shooter. Basically the plot goes like this... The world was taken over by a powerful organization under the control of Hourai Tenrou a man who found an artifact on the small island nation of Hourai, the ""Ubusunagami Okinokai"" also known as the ""Power of the Gods"", buried deep under the earth. After acquiring this ultimate source of power, Hourai Tenrou decided to take over the world by waging war against the ones who would oppose, little by little the world was devoured by the power of gods and so mankind decided to build an resistance to counterfeit Tenrous army. You play as a guy called Shinra, a member of the freedom force who is shoot down with his plane after an excessive battle with the Tenrou forces, however Shinra survives the incident and crashes with his plane on a remote island called Ikaruga. The townspeople of Ikaruga save Shinra and nurse him back to life, after that the towns eldest hands him over their most powerful and advanced space craft called ""the Ikaruga"". So Shinra once again sets off to settle the score with Tenrous space armada and of course to save the world. 8/10Gameplay:Ikaruga is a 3D vertical space-shooter so you control your ship from one stage to another by pulling of very difficult and frenzy maneuvers. Your ship is equipped with a laser blaster as well as a missile launch device and whats the most important thing about Ikaruga is, its unique polarization system, means every enemy force you encounter will either be white or black. You can switch your ships appearance instantly by pressing the right trigger and this will turn your ship from black to white and reverse allowing you to absorb the enemies bullets to power up your missile attacks. Overall the gameplay is very decent and awesome even though most of the people wont like the switching between black and white, I thought it was a very good idea and supports the ideal this game is based on 9/10Controls:The controls work like a charm for this game, they are very simple and easy to learn but trust me it takes a hell of a time to master your maneuvering and switching between black/white skills. You can use your directional pad to move your spaceship freely and by pressing two buttons you can either fire your laser blaster or commence your missile attack and of course you can switch between black or white polarization by pressing your gamepads trigger. And thats it, you wont have to bother too much with complicated button combos like in other shooters this is also due to the fact that this game was designed for arcade gaming and was imported to the dreamcast. 9/10Graphics:The graphics may seem outdated for our next gen standards but nevertheless the stages and level designs are very well drawn and the 3D effects and bosses are very smooth and colorful, I think this game fits perfect into the category game with perfect visuals and graphics. 9/10Sound:The sound score is great as well and delivers what it should do also it is by far more memorable than other monotone tunes which are overused in most space shooters. You will notice a slight dramatical change in the sound when you advance from stage to stage, blasting your way through hordes of enemy spacecrafts. In short the sound is awesome and is perfectly implied in the whole game and delivers a very intense and thrilling feeling. 9/10My Review:Before we talk about the game itself and cover the review with my thoughts and regards lets clear some things about Ikaruga first. Ikaruga was originally designed for arcade gaming in japan and wasn't even released in europe or the USA, it was much later that this game actually appeared for the Dreamcast console and was later also released for the Nintendo Gamecube and the Xbox360 download section but I cover the Dreamcast release in my review so I cant tell for sure how enhanced the Gamecube version is, nevertheless it should be on par with the original Ikaruga arcade game.The first thing when you hear of the word ""Ikaruga"" and the game itself, there should be exactly three thoughts about this game... One, incredibly hard ! Two, addictive ! And three, very fun !As you are about to start the first stage you can and should try practice mode before even attempting to clear the first level of this tense shooter. Practice mode is a small tutorial which introduces you to the controls and helps you maneuvering the Ikaruga, after that you can choose either easy, normal or hard mode (don't even think about hard mode for now lol) and start your epic flight to the sky. Its very simple and straight forward, you have a space-ship, you have lots of enemies in front of you and of course you have kickass background sound to motivate you shooting your way through them. What do you need more you may ask ?! Well... the magic words here are actually practice (a lot) and of course pure skill which will come handy if you wanna time your laser blasts or want to perform chain combos. One of the best and worse things about Ikaruga is actually the very high difficulty which makes this game a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥or one of the most challenging games ever, suit yourself. The difficulty is very punishing because one hit and your space-ship will explode to pieces and of course your replay credits are very limited which makes it nearly impossible for casual gamers even to reach Stage 4, at least with little skill there is.The game uses a unique polarity system which is really easy to use but will put your reactions into a very heavy challenge. Everything in Ikaruga is based on black or white, means you can switch your space-ship from one state to another also the enemies themselves and the bullets they fire can be absorbed by your space-ship if you can synchronize your polarity with theirs. White enemies will receive more damage by black laser-shots than the white ones, your space-ship can absorb enemy-fire if is the same color an retaliate with missiles and so on. The key is to switch between black and white to either destroy your enemies fast or to absorb their bullets to power up your ship for some powerful missile blast. It will take you time and patience to learn how to react to the enemies attacks and this is why this game is so hard. Another cool thing about this game are the chain combos you can perform by blasting a repetitive amount of enemies without just shooting wild, again ... it requires lots of skill and lots of practice to reach very high chain combos (my personal record was 50 chains and it was very hardcore, I don't think I 'll be able to ever reach more). After completing one stage you are given grades from S++ (the best) to C (the worst), depending on how many enemies you have killed or for completing a high amount of chain combos and so on (my best try was an A grade and wow thats pretty bad lol).The game itself offers only 5 stages and can be completed under 30 minutes if you are some hardcore shooter pro gamer which wasn't my type to begin with. As I said Ikaruga was designed for arcade gaming and has a lot of arcade features in it so therefore you will either get hooked up by the intense and flashy gameplay or you will swing your gamepad against your TV screen because of its difficulty. The main reason for people to play this game is in my opinion the soundtrack and the high amount of ""try and fail"" value this game offers, of course you will lose and of course you will try again to see how far you can get and thats all the charm about this game ^^.Final Words:Ikaruga is a very unique and tense experience if you are in for some insane and difficult space-shooter or arcade gaming, it offers all there is to offer for its genre and can be easily described as one of the best space-shooters up to date. Final Score 9/10"

Originally released in Japan on Sega Dreamcast, it didn't find very much popularity in America back in the days of its release...but now, with more people leaning towards the bullet hell genre, its popularity rises once again.Ikaruga is probably up there on one of the harder bullet hell games you'll play. A normal 2D vertical scroller with amazing 3D graphics that you normally don't see on a shmup, this gem will both aggrivate you and keep you entertained for a few hours. What it lacks in length of gameplay it'll make up for in increasing difficulty.Ikaruga is a game about a normal ship with normal rapid-fire bullets...however, the twist on this game is a mechanic called 'Polarity'. There's either white, or black, which you can quickly change with the click of a mouse button or controller button. Your enemies are either white or black, and they shoot like bullets. If your polarity matches that of your enemies, you'll do more damage to them as well as absorbing their shots. As you absorb same colored hits, your energy meter fills up....and with another click of a button, you release hell on earth in the form of homing missiles instantly obliterating anything they touch as well as shooting through obstacles to meet their marks.However, the one shot from the opposing polarity will blow you out of the sky.The game is very fast paced and hectic, and with the added polarity mechanic adds even more difficulty requiring your fullest attention. As far as bullet hell games go, you'll either love them or hate them, but whichever one you choose, make sure Ikaruga is on your 'to play' list. Well worth the pennies you drop to buy it."

,Recommended,253750,18164651,"Posted: 23 September, 2015",all,Graced by Autumn,"Originally released as an arcade game in 2001, Ikaruga garnered high praise from critics as the spiritual successor to Treasure's much-lovedRadiant Silvergunand quickly became one of the most popular bullet hell games of the decade. Witnessing a second and third release on the Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo GameCube in 2002 and 2003 respectively, the legendary Shmup was later introduced to the newer generation after its success lead to a fourth release on the XBLA in 2008.While narrative clearly wasn't the main focal point of the game during the development phase, Ikaruga does feature an interesting backstory that gives appropriate context to the characters' actions. Tenro Horai; the leader of a small nation known as Horai; came across the Ubusunagami Okinokai or 'Power of the Gods', affording her powers surpassing that of any normal human being. With 'The Divine Ones' at her side, Tenro launched a campaign of global conquest. As the Horai felled each nation one by one, a small group of those brave enough to defy the Horai emerged, called the Tenkaku. Using advanced fighter aircraft known as 'Hitekkai', they fought a desperate battle against the Horai, but ultimately proved to be no match for their adversaries and suffered a swift and humiliating defeat. Once thought to have been among the many victims of the Horai's conquest, a young man called Shinra who had fought for the Tenkaku was shot down in an aerial battle high above the clouds. Dragged from the wreckage of his fighter and taken to the village of Ikaruga, Shinra was nursed back to health and entrusted by the village people with a powerful fighter unlike any other – the Ikaruga. Using the energies of two polarities, the Ikaruga was a versatile aircraft that could adapt to any given situation. With the power of the Ikaruga at his side, Shinra once again took to the skies to battle the Horai and bring about an end to their tyranny.Ikaruga's most prominent feature; and indeed that which sets it apart from almost every other shmup to date; is its polarity system. Enemies appear in three varieties, each corresponding to one or both 'polarities'. White enemies fire white bullets towards the player, while black enemies discharge black bullets. Each boss typically utilizes both polarities and is capable of executing attacks using bullets of either. The Ikaruga itself however, is capable of switching between both polarities mid-flight, on the fly, thus introducing one of the game's most important mechanics – alternating polarities. While using the white polarity, the Ikaruga fires white bullets and is unaffected by those of that polarity fired by the enemy, though direct contact with black bullets is fatal. Any black enemies hit whilst using the white polarity also suffer significantly greater damage than what they would have suffered, had the black polarity been active. White bullets that draw near the Ikaruga are absorbed and converted into energy used to fuel a powerful homing missile attack. The reverse applies when using the black polarity.This clever mechanic encourages a 'risk versus reward' style of play that; together with the game's high level of difficulty; results in a very challenging but rewarding experience that makes Ikaruga one of Treasure's most enjoyable titles to play. The stage design itself is also particularly praiseworthy, both for its complexity and originality. While the first stage is quite easily manageable, every stage beyond it forces the player into a head-on confrontation with intricate mazes of bullets that require one to fully master the polarity switching mechanic in order to stand even the slightest chance of reaching the results screen. Skilled players can try to mix up their polarities by alternating on a regular basis to maximize the damage inflicted on the enemy, a tactic that becomes particularly viable when facing off against most of Ikaruga's bosses. Stage 3's boss stands out as being one of Ikaruga's trickier bosses that requires a more subtle approach from the player, involving the use of a number of advanced polarity switching techniques.Destroying three enemies of the same polarity consecutively results in a 'Chain', causing a substantial rise in the player's score. Each stage has been carefully designed in such a manner that it is possible for the very best players to complete a 'perfect' run of every stage by carrying a chain throughout the entire level, provided the enemies' attack patterns have been learnt well.Though the game features a steep learning curve that is likely to deter players who are new to games of the genre, Ikaruga offers a fantastic experience to anyone willing to take the time and effort to master the polarity switching mechanic.Ikaruga's visuals are for the most part very impressive. The vast majority of finely-detailed enemies are well-animated. But what truly stands out is their unique design. Many of the enemies Ikaruga throws at the player look nothing like any enemies seen in other bullet helll games. The boss of the fourth stage is one prime example of the sheer creativity poured forth into the game. Each and every background also benefits from the same level of detail seen in the enemy design, with some of the game's mechanical backgrounds being among the most memorable for that reason. The lighting effects seen throughout the outdoor environments capture an atmosphere that makes every stage as breathtaking to look at as it is to play.Ikaruga's powerful musical score plays a major role in contributing towards the creation of a different feel for each stage. While flights through enormous enemy facilities are accompanied by orchestral music with the subtle; yet highly effective; integration of techno music, massive aerial battles amidst amber-tinted skies are fought to the triumphant sounds of trumpets, capturing the intensity and desperation of the fight. Each boss' defeat is followed by a loud and catastrophic explosion that sounds just as impressive as it is to behold.Ikaruga is the finest example of an innovative bullet hell game that is both a masterpiece in terms of its gameplay and art direction. Those who possess the time and dedication necessary to master Ikaruga and its original gameplay mechanics in order to experience the game to its fullest can expect to find themselves utterly absorbed by Treasure's iconic Shmup for a long time to come."

Most keyboards do not allow that, which usually means you die.I havent tried mouse controls yet, so no opinions there.The game lets you use the analog stick of the controller, although the game was originally only digital, so it might feel awkward to players, who are used to digital controls.In addition to the steering, there are only 3 keys used, shoot, switch ship color and homing laser burst.Graphics (decent):Slightly outdated yet still good looking (the game was made in 2001).Except for Resolutions and HUD modifications, there's not much you can change. I think there is no Anti-Aliasing which makes for some rougher edges, but correct me if im wrong.The game allows you to play at full 1200p or 1080, in 3 modes:- top-down leaves the game with huge borders, but unless you can flip your screen by 90 degrees, this will be the desired option- left-to-right fills the whole screen but everything is turned by 90 degrees, which feels really awkward.- top-down full screen on a vertical monitor: this is what you really want, turn your monitor or tv by 90 degrees and play the game the same way it first appeared on arcade machines.Gameplay(10 out of 10):There are no upgrades, only 2 weapons (straight forward shot and homing laser burst), so what gives this a 10 out of 10?It's the unique black and white system: enemies get to shoot you with either black or white projectiles/beams/etc.. You can evade projectiles of one color by switching the Ikaruga's (your ship) shields to the according color. Instead of taking damage(instant death) your shield actually absorbs the projectiles of the same color, charging your homing lasers, which in turn can be released for a devastating attack against all enemies on the screen.By switching the color of your ship, your projectiles also change their color. Hitting an enemy with the opposite color does double damage, while shooting the same color makes the hostile burst into more projectiles of that color on normal or hard difficulty.If you're into beating high-scores, the game constantly requires you to kill 3 enemies of the same color in a row. Keep doing this and you build up chains multiplying your score. Hit the wrong color and the chain breaks.The game is also quite short, beating it takes about 40-60 minutes (rough guess), but the sense of accomplishment will only settle in, once you beat it without constantly dying.Difficulty (hardcore/satisfying):There are 3 difficulty modes, easy, normal and hard, but don't let these confuse you, easy will permanently lead you to your death in the first hours of gameplay.The tactics, required to survive, and perhaps even doing so with a good score, will change drastically with each difficulty.The black/white system and the hundreds of projectiles filling the screen will make your brain melt at first, but once you get used to it, it's not all that hard on easy mode.Normal mode ups the difficulty by bursting dying enemies of the same color into even more projectiles to fill the screen.Hard mode lets all enemies burst into projectiles of their respective color, making for a really hard time.There is also nothing random about the game, everything is pre-scripted, which means, you will eventually learn every step required for survival.Infinite continues (requires enabling in the settings) allow you to finish the game, no matter how often you die.Multiplayer(my friends love it, but they keep breaking my high score):The game allows local coop by attaching a (second) gamepad.Coop itself is quite fun, and the game becomes easier when your friend covers the other half of the screen, though creating chains for a good score becomes a lot harder. There are also some tight spots that get even tighter when two people try covering in the same spot, in fact you can push your friend to their death which will earn you some angry looks.The ships are quite easy to discern at first, but become a bit harder when a lot of projectiles fill the screen.If you have dual-stick controller, you can also fly both ships by yourself - a very confusing experience indeed."

Most dub this as a spiritual successor to Radiant Silvergun, another Treasure classic that was released on Sega's system years ago.  Regardless, if you enjoy bullet-hell shooters, then this game will be right up your alley.  The implementation of the black/white bullet gameplay is a nice switch-up and the skill/practice needed to chain together kills with the right color shots.  You can absorb whatever shots are thrown your way if you're in the correct color mode.  This allows you to charge up your super shot also and unleash some heavy damage.  The game starts off relatively tame then gets rather hectic, really quick.  The soundtrack fits the game pretty well and obviously has a convoluted storyline most shooters like this do.  There's the obvious scoring system that perfectionists are going to want to max out out as high as possible.  The bosses were also well designed and get progessively harder throughout the course of the game.  The length is on par with other shooters, and can be finished rather quick if you aren't in it to master the craft and up your score.  Definitely for the niche shooter lover market.  I wouldn't recommend the game to casuals."

I had this game on GameCube, and I figured that I had ""beat"" it only because I unlocked Free-Play mode, and I had traded it to Gameshit. Because I'm stupid like that.Thank Cthulhu that Treasure ported this game to PC. It could not have been Greenlit fast enough.So, for those of you who have never played this absolutely beautiful, intense, and ultimately PUNISHING game that will have you swearing like a sailor by the time you see that dreaded ""Game Over"" screen, Ikaruga is a ""Bullet Hell"" arcade space shooter that has you managing bullet absorption and evasion: You can absorb bullets of the same color, and you can switch between colors at any time. You will be killed by bullets (I say ""will"" because its pretty much inevitable) of the opposite color.In this port, Treasure has given us Free Play mode right off the bat, which means that you get as many Continues as you want until you finish the game. I recommend setting Continues to Five, and setting max lives per continue to Five. This, I feel gives new players and those returning to the game a fair chance (as if that phrase belongs here...), but still be punished for failure.A note on the controls: Keyboard and Mouse work fine here. I first tried using the arrow keys and Z, X, and C to fire, switch polarity, and activate superweapon, until I discovered--much to my excitement--that I can use the mouse to fire/switch polarity/activate superweapon. I also recommend turning OFF the feature that allows you to hit Mouse 1 and Mouse 2 at the same time to activate homing lasers, and just use the middle mouse button for that.The game has five levels, and combat is treated more like a puzzle than anything else, much like any good Bullet-Hell shooter. There is a higher plane of existence beyond simply surviving through this unrelenting gauntlet; mastering the Chain system (kill 3 enemies of like color to begin the chain, and keep this pattern for as long as possible) is a completely different animal, and one that I have certainly not even attempted. This is one of those games where even watching someone who has attained a degree of skill make his or her way through is nothing short of an artistic performance.Seriously, people. Buy this game."

Forget the shades of grey, it all boils down to black and white, with just a touch of red and blue for good measure.This game is honestly one of the best shmups I've ever played. Most games that match the level of hype Ikaruga maintains are a letdown, but this one is everything it's ever been made out to be if not more. It is hard. Really hard. But it never feels cheap. Every death feels like it was your fault. The seemingly simple mechanic of reversing the ship's polarity opens up for surprisingly deep gameplay, making weaving through bullet curtains a much more involved (though by no means easier) experience. Rather than just dodge, you actually try to get hit in order to charge your ""super weapon.""In short, if you like shmups, Treasure, and/or punishingly difficult yet fair games, get this. At $10, you can't go wrong. Also, as an XP user, I can vouch that it's working after the update; literally the only problem I have with it is the broken Offline Mode support, and it's NOWHERE near enough for me to not recommend this game.Get it; play it; love it."

The 3D graphics, soundtrack, control and hit detection are all satisfying.When I just bought the game, I thought, ""oh well a dodge-bullet game? It certainly seems good, and I've been playing Touhou(famous dodge-bullet franchise from Japan) for years, so it shouldn't be too hard for me, right?""And then I found myself to be too naive. This game gave me nightmares. It's too hard. Way too hard. There are 5 stages in total, and even in easy mode, each stage cost me a good number of credits. I can only defeat 3 of the 5 bosses(again with lots of credits). Thank god there's free play.So why is this game that hard? The danmaku itself isn't so hard, but I just keep dying and dying. I watched some replays from the in-game online leaderboard, and I think I know why.The rules of this game are too complicated. You have to take care of too many things all at the same time. To list some of them:1. Dodge all bullets of your opposite polarity.2. Try to absorb as many bullets of your polarity as possible, because you need energy.3. Watch where you're flying so you don't crash into the wall or get stuck, which happens a lot.4. Watch the enemy's life bar and know when they'll die, so you don't get surprised by their countarattack.5. Think about when to unleash homing missiles. These aren't just an optional powerup, these are required to get past certain situations.6. And keep in mind the chain you are building up if you want a good score. Shoot one wrong enemy and all chain is lost.Oh hell. I actually regret buying this game, because I would prefer an ""easier"" game where you just hold down the shoot button, and then all you care about is dodging bullets. I still give this game a ""recommended"" though, because it is a good game, just too complicated and too hard.Another complaint is that the system requirement is too high. Even after an update including video options, the game still can't run at 60fps at lowest settings.+ dodge bullets like crazy+ shooting combied with puzzle+ online leaderboard- system requirement too high- too difficult7 out of 10, good."

I guarantee, you will die a lot in Ikaruga, and most people will probably rage quit in mere minutes, but if you're like me, and love an great, arcadey challenge of a shmup to add to your collection, then this is something I wholeheartedly reccommend.For those looking for an adrenaline rush, this game has it ready, with it's crosseye-inducing bullet avoiding and collecting.

I think Ikaruga is overrated in terms of bullet hells with a mechanic not everyone can wrap their head around. With how complex the game can be you're probably better off playing less mecahnically difficult games like Crimzon Clover, Jamestown or even Touhou.But with that said as a game by Treasure it is fantastic, definitly one of their best. Like I said before the mechanic of switching between white and black to absorb bullets and deal double damage to an opposite coloured ship is really complex and the most devoted player can do an insane amount of things with it.The soundtrack for the most part is fitting to the mood but can be really grand at many points. Graphically I'd say is still the same as it looked on the Dreamcast, Gamecube and original Arcade though a lot more cleaner. This isn't really an issue as the games style still looks really nice even though most of the time it's dodging black and white bullets.Difficulty is what you expect from Treasure with this game probably ranking close to that of Alien Soldiers type of difficulty which is another Treasure game that's ball bustingly hard.Overall Ikaruga is definitly a fantastic game that I think is worth it to those who want to devote time to learn the tricks and patterns the game has to offer. However if you want this as your first bullet hell I would recommend finding one that's a little more beginner friendly before trying this game out.

The paint-like art style has definitely allowed this game to age better than its spiritual predecessor Radiant Silvergun.- Incredible Music. Every tune is lovely to my ears.- Easy to learn, insanely hard to master gameplay. It's rather incredible just how many challenges Treasure's designers managed to squeeze out of the incredibly simple mechanics at play here, and it's awesome to see all the creative enemy designs they were able to make with them as well.- Satisfying as all hell. Seriously, those explosions. I have never felt quite so good when killing a troublesome boss.Cons:- A menu annoyances. To my knowledge, once you select a game mode, you can't back out if you clicked something you didn't mean to. Effectively, you have to play a game and kill yourself or reset the game to get back to the title screen.- No real explanation of the story. There is a plot to this game, and it's not an excuse plot. I won't devote time to explaining it here, but I do think it's quite a shame that there's no signs of the story in this port (again, to my knowledge).- Chaining. I admit, I have never been a fan of this part of Ikaruga. While it's certainly nowhere near as bad as it was in Radiant Silvergun (There, you had to chain to upgrade your weapons, which was *essential* to defeating later bosses), I still don't particularly like a scoring system that effectively forces you to memorize everything that happens in an entire stage to hit those elusive S++ ranks. Granted, I'm also terrible at chaining, so take that as you will.Overall, Ikaruga has earned its reputation as being one of the greatest shoot-'em ups ever made. Fantastic level design, creative boss designs, good story (in the versions that actually have it), great visuals and music. What else could you ask for?Before I go, though, one word of warning:While far from the hardest game in this genre, Ikaruga is still difficult. Like, really, really, really difficult.

Definitely gets a crazy number of bullets flying all at once!  Interesting idea in that you alternate 'polarity' (ie: red or blue) and only that color bullet will hit you.  Which makes for just a ton of stuff flying around that you're trying to hit, dodge, and just try to make sense of what is going on.

You are supposed to kill enemies three at a time, which adds depth to the game; you're not just trying to stay alive, you're trying to develop the most efficient plan of attack. Once you do find the most effective path, you will find yourself executing the same routine over and over. So there's a lot more involved than reflex time and memorizing the enemies' moves. You have to hone your own strategies and execute them precisely over and over. It gets repetitive, but that comes with the genre."

One of the more difficult bullet hells around, even from playing this game in the past on the gamecube even now I still struggle making progress on this. This game is an incredibly difficult bullet hell which requires patience and skill and has a unique shield mechanic where your colour shield absorbs the same coloured bullets - it sounds like it would make the game slightly easier but trust me, its just an excuse for them to throw more bullets than the screen can fit at you.The game has brilliant visuals, the music is incredible, the gameplay is enjoyable and rewarding and the game is harder than schwarzeneggers biceps. If you think your pretty good at bullet hells, this game will prove you wrong."
,Recommended,253750,14326918,"Posted: 4 February, 2015",all,Kohi_Noir,"Tough as nails and beautiful to behold.Ikaruga and its spiritual predecessor Radiant Silvergun (which I hope to one day see on steam) are the pinnacle of the shoot em up genre, made by the masters at Treasure. Flawless controls, top notch unique designs and oozing character from every bullet-ridden pore. If more shmups were this good the genre would be a lot more than an almost forgotten relic from arcade days past and a playground for uncreative indie developers (sorry guys, everybody and their moms can make a generic shmup).Ikaruga owes a lot to its grandfather ""Space Invaders"", like any other vertical-scrolling shooter but cleverly subverts the basic concept by giving you a colour-switching mechanic: red/black bullets only hurt you when you are white/blue and vice versa. However if you think this will make the game easy you are mistaken. The screen is filled with artful patterns of red and blue that will give you an intense challenge and plenty of replay value, because you will die and die a lot. There are no power-ups, no shields, just a super shot that fills up by collecting bullets which quickly becomes necessary to survive at all. Get hit once and you are dead of course. The gameplay offers more layers of complexity and challenge when you want to go for the big points. Shooting 3 enemies of one colour in a row will chain your points together. Skillful players can continue this chain from beginning to end of each level, although at first it might seem impossible to newcomers.The game can be a bit bare bones if you are not a shoot em up fan with only 5 levels in total, but these blow pretty much the whole competition out of the water. The steam port also offers crisp HD graphics, a selection of unlockable artworks and an incredibly well-made leaderboard section. You can quickly download every playthrough from other players and thus learn how to survive this one of a kind bullet hell extravaganza.Developer support is also great. I bought Ikaruga when it was first released and at first it wasn't possible to play offline or on older Windows XP systems (which were at the end of their lifespan but still supported) as promised on the store page, both were patched in a matter of days by the developers who genuinely want to give players a good experience.All in all one of my best purchases on steam. Ikaruga was worth the 9000Yen I paid back in the day on dreamcast, at this price it is a steal."

,Recommended,253750,9179243,"Posted: 19 February, 2014",all,Lipucd,"Made back in 2001, this game would turn shmup's on it's head by developing one of the most interesting, and since then heavly copied gimmicks of quite some time. Your ship can take 1 of two 'shifts', able to deal extra damage towards the oppasite shift, and asorb any bullets from the same, but in turn is a 'one hit wonder' towards the other color. With this, along with Treasures '3 same chain' from Raident Silvergun sets this up more as a very dynamic and fast flowing 'puzzle' game then a 'bullet hell'.Instead of trying to just live, you'll be worrying about the order of enemys you kill to keep your chain going. You'll be asorbing shots left and right to fill your meater up, at times leaving foes alone for this action alone. There really isn't another breed of shooter like this that makes you double take on your approtch, more less REWARDS you for not killing everything the second it spawns on screen.This game thought is hard as nails thanks towards the change in focus you need to make for it, and it alone, and you'll have to sit down and replay stages over and over, learning their patterns towards a 'T' if wishing to get all of those achivements and place well on the global leaderboards.As for what this version does that the Dreamcast, Gamecube, and XBLA doesn't:-full 60fps with no slowdown outside of the 'intended' doing boss explosions, even on a Geforce 9500 GT, making this the smoothest version yet.-It is Arcade perfect in scoring and results, something the XBLA had major issues with-Online leaderboards with the ablity to download and watch replays from anyone else who had 'ranked in', allowing you to study from the best without a secondary source.-Keyboard, Mouse, and the all desired 'Duel Play' options for controls, giving this version the most freedom of input choices to tweek towards your needs.-All of the 'Extra' options are unlocked at the very start, no need to run the game idle for 10 hours to get everything.If there are any flaws, it is the lack of background and story information present in the Dreamcast version, more less the artwork relating towards such. The lack of a 'Music Player' option as well is slighty depressing, and of course this version lacks the Online Co-Op that the XBLA had ( thought suggested issues with that version seem to steam from said option... ), meaning the last three achivements will have to be done with ether a friend nearby, or to master Duel Play, a feat only a haldful of people thus far have mastered."
76561197972734792,Recommended,253750,26970516,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,Grampire,"Disclaimer:Playtime should probably be around 75-100 hours, as I played the crap out of the GCN version back in the day (which is still sitting on my shelf).This is in my humble opinion the best shoot-em-up of all time, and while I'm not a hardcore fan of the genre, I have played enough to feel that it's a decent title for that mantle.  I've rarely played a game developed by Treasure that disappoints, and this is probably their best.The incredible visuals (which have aged exceptionally well), the amazing musical score and sound effects already set this game apart from many shooters.  However, the unique ""polarity"" mechanic and simple, straightforward controls truly make this game remarkable and unique, even compared to others developed by Treasure.The ability to absorb attacks that would otherwise destroy you, and to have control over this mechanic for every attack in the game, adds a level of depth and strategy that isn't typical of games in this genre.  The mechanic is easy to understand, but often extremely difficult to apply optimally.This mechanic is displayed throughout the masterfully crafted stages, which is the trademark of any Treasure game.  You would be hard pressed to find a shoot-em-up developer that can create stages that seem so chaotic and tense yet are so deliberate and organized in design.I should warn that this game isn't for the faint of heart.  It's disgustingly difficult to master and really demands a lot of concentration and pattern recognition from the player to find success.  The only payoffs are bragging rights and hi-scores, which both come with a sense of accomplishment that you've overcome such a difficult game."

,Not Recommended,253750,35382996,Posted: 1 October,all,Arkan01d,"I like this game, but I don't actually like this game. At it's core Ikaruga is a rythm game that happens to be a bullet hell. It's the bullet hell of bullet hells. It's the type of game where, if you beat it the way the game intends, you could officially say you have a doctorate in bullet hells. My two biggest downvote reasons for this game: I don't like rythm games and I don't enjoy hardcore gaming.The controls are fluid. The gameplay is solid. However, there is a learning curve to this game that most will shy away from. I like this game ONLY when friends are over and we couch co-op with unlimited continues, because it's the only way I enjoy it. The game taunts you for not playing on hardcore reminding you that you won't get a highscore and the level bosses just go away after a certain time. Meaning if you don't play their way, they'll let you see the content, but you don't actually get to fully enjoy the game.I'm sure if I put a few hundred hours into Ikaruga I could be a master at this game. Unfortunately the game does nothing to entice you into playing it. The first level is turned up to 11. It's like leaving middle school and walking into a doctorate course. Expect to instantly fail...a lot! For me, that's just not fun."
