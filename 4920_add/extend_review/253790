,Recommended,253790,9149961,"Posted: 16 February, 2014",all,VALIS,"A very stylish, spacy RTS-lite that has you commanding your little block men to mine resources, build, research and defend, with the ultimate goal of reaching and researching the four monoliths in each corner of the smallish map. The gameplay is as minimalistic as the graphics -- you have seven building structures to choose from, and have to balance your construction of them based on your available resources, while at the same time making sure you don't put your block men too far away from their battle stations at any time as they must fend off the occasional attack wave, which increase in frequency and strength as the game goes on.Without balance and a fair (but not frustrating) level of difficulty, this game probably would have been too simple to be anything but a flavor of the minute, the type of game you play for a day or two to never return to. But it is well balanced and challenging, and the minimal graphics and excellent space synth soundtrack (my wife walked by and asked if I was listening to Pink Floyd) allow this game to succeed in both style and play."

The AI does a lot of the work, you have no direct control over your blocky minions. Rest assured the AI does it's job pretty well, I rarely got annoyed by the AI doing things inefficiently.If you're looking for a challenge you can up the difficulty by going for the harder modes or attempting some of the more difficult achivements. All of a sudden efficient placement of your tetrislike rooms becomes a lot more crucial!In short, definitely recommended for anyone who is into this kind of strategy/management games. If you're looking for a game with a lot of different options or want control over your ""troops"", then Rymdkapsel might be too niche for you."

I got so into the game I played for 3+ hours without realizing. I thought maybe 40 minutes had gone by.It did a couple things right for me personally to achieve that: enjoyable base building and management of units, despite the minimal approach + short, challenging, make it or break it runs to achieve various goals. The first level/difficulty of the game was a blast, easy enough to keep playing though challenging enough you will die, reassess your strategy, and start over a few times. Next level/difficulty is more challenging (I haven't gotten all the achievements yet) but similar. Build, manage, gather and grow resources, power ups, fight enemies, die, reassess strategy, try again. It's quite fun and sucks you in!All of that works really well and I'd recommend it. The downside is that it's a small, short game. Once you beat those two levels/difficulties and their set of achievements you're done with the game.Personally I'd love to have seen several more levels and maps and more enemy variety. Maybe a couple more game mechanics. Also, a zen mode, super easy mode, or a huuuuuge map that you could really put some time and effort into a base instead of the many shorter bursts. Just any game mode that you could play an extended game on.But none of that really took away from the fun. Get it on sale if you want, it's fun and worth playing for a bit if you're into RTS games."

Complexities are handled with exceptional grace; in many ways it's evocative ofTetris, that king of the casual digital pastime, not just in its mechanics but in its accessibility and gripping power.rymdkapseldeftly balances pensive downtime (building your station, managing resources and units) with punctuated bursts of frenzy (enemy attacks), and the difficulty gradually ramps up as your area expands and proper resource management becomes increasingly tricky. Every element is of critical importance to each other, and the agency provided means that no two games should play the same way.You can play to relax or to pursue a number of larger goals that provide replay value and foster a sense of ongoing improvement. These tasks may seem few, but you likely won't achieve them all in a game or two, nor does the game expect you will. You must work for these milestones, and before you know it you'll find the hours flying by as you drive the push out to the next monolith or fight off just one more wave of enemies.Some might be turned off by the game's slow pace, especially in the early-going, but those that stick with it will find reward, even if it outwardly seems short-lived. Once you’ve picked apart the game’s elaborate system and discovered the path to completing every task, there’s nothing else to see aside from a harder variation in Plus mode and a Zen mode that feels incomplete without periodic enemy invasions.Still, if you like puzzle games or real-time strategy, this meditative space odyssey is a killer time-killer."

The second time, you realize what's pretty much an optimal strategy for the game.  From there, all you can do is tweak that strategy a little bit.  Also, there's a pretty obvious and easy way to futz the tetris-block-placement part of the gameplay and once you start doing that, the game is more about how OCD you want to be with the building placement than anything else.Fun for a couple of hours, but then the overall fun-to-work ratio gets much worse.

That is all rymdkapsel is: an interesting idea lacking any substance. It is like a good puzzle game, but rymdkapsel does not give you a variety of challenges you would expect to get in a puzzle game (""it is too short"").If you don't mind me oversimplifying - you choose rooms to construct which are randomly tetris-shaped - then your job is to assign tasks to your minions (to construct or defend). But you do not control your minions directly, you only assign tasks, and if lucky the AI will do exactly what you want. Periodically waves of enemies will invade randomly destroying your minions and resources. You need to be challenged but the way the enemy work feels like your success is more based on luck.The graphics are simple pleasing geometric shapes.

At first I did worry about those finite resources (the little pink flakes) and I was right to. Once they are exhausted the game is all but over.You have weapons that are never upgraded, enemies that never change, base functions that are never enhanced.The zen mode is particularly pointless. If it was a matter of building a functioning base, with resource management and exploration playing a part it would be fine, but there's none of that.Your minions are born when you create ""quarters"" which implies that the quarters will be required to sustain the minions, but once the quarter has spawned it's allocated two minions you can reclaim it and the minions are retained, sleeping when idle wherever they fall!Once you figure that out the main strategic aim of the game (to survive attack after attack) becomes much easier as you reclaim the resources of quarters after each spawning.

What begins with the simple maxim, ""Less is more,"" evolves into a study in negative space, contrast and juxtaposition, color, and the quintessential expression of an idea. It's an incredibly challenging discipline to adhere to and execute faithfully.It's easy to see that rymdkapsel is a minimalist game. Stylistically this much is obvious. But this game embodies the whole spirit of minimalism. It does not merely conflate low-fidelity with minimalism, as some 8- and 16-bit styled indie titles do.Rymdkapsel is a space sim. You control a tetrad-bound space station with little people in it. The presents you with one essential goal: survive. The fundamental strategy to do so is easily explained with the in-game tutorial and involves a handful of room types. How these rooms behave play into a neat and concise set of rules with no caveats and special cases.There is a fine balance here between simple game play and flexibility of strategy. It might seem that there is a master strategy one could use, but the expression of that strategy allows a great deal of variance and keeps it interesting from game to game.You could say that there are optional goals like ""research all the monoliths"", but those are just advanced constructs of the same root goal. Researching monoliths provides passive improvement to your space citizens, so the purity of the one goal is not diluted. You are never really required to pursue this. Artificial constructs like 'achievements' might goad you to, but in truth, you don't really ""get"" anything for doing so.Games rarely last more than an hour. A natural escalation of aggression guarantees that, in the end, you will lose. Recall that the goal of the game is to survive - the metric, therefore, is how long you can. Consider: a strategy game that terminates like an endless line runner. The elegance of this solution is a little mind-blowing.I enjoy this game quite a good deal and would recommend it to anyone looking for an engaging sim with low game-to-game time investment. This was a hit on tablets and I waited for the PC version to pick it up; it plays wonderfully and I don't get the sense that anything was lost in translation."

Often times you'll have units across the station respond to an order, while a closer unit ignores it. That in itself is annoying, but wouldn't be so bad if the the minion AI wasn't stupid. In addition to selecting units across the station to perform a task instead of a closer one,  you will frequently see your minions carrying more resources than are needed to a room.Do not buy in current state.

It's just that you'll probably play this game and then feel as though it wasn't a good way to spend time. There's not a lot to it and not a lot of compulsion to reach goals.

,Not Recommended,253790,13854777,"Posted: 5 January, 2015",all,DarkNetFan,"I do all my reviews in a similar fashion so I can cross-reference and check whether I'm being honest with myself. Ratings for categories range from 0-10 and the final rating ranges from 0-100 but isnotthe sum of the other ratings - they do not all have the same importance. I'm trying to be as objective as possible, but needless to say this is a subjective view of a user.I only play games on PC on Windows and Linux with mouse and keyboard, so I cannot give any analysis to how well games work with controllers or on Mac.Playtime at last review update: 2.3 hoursDescriptionRymdkapsel is a light/casual strategy game.StoryNo story.0/10VisualsIt has very simple isometric graphics, which is largely fine for the game. Unfortunately even that simple graphics style could have used a little refinement. Especially the background is downright embarassing - it's a spinning black background with stripes on it. Even if you like the graphics and think they fit the game as I do there's nothing special here.3/10SoundThe background music is monotone and annoying. The sound effects are minimalistic but fit the game, but also nothing special here.2/10ControlsYou control with the mouse. The controls work fine for what's offered.10/10OptionsNearly no options in this one. Colorblind mode, tutorial messages on or off, sound on or off (no separate options, no sliders), fullscreen or not and screen scaling, which zooms the game in or out (I assume that's for the lack of resolution options). This is one of the most minimalistic options menus I have ever seen. It doesn't even have a real difficulty setting or save slots.0/10GameplayYou have a couple of minions that are responsible for everything that's happening on your space station. There are a couple of ressources that have to be transported and some building blocks that you can place and your minions have to build. All you can do, though, is assign minions to certain very broad tasks (or should I say task groups) like construction, base defense, food supply and so on. This is not inherently bad and clearly the idea of the game, but it just doesn't work at all with their AI. Example: one task group is construction. Let's say I put all my 10 minions into construction with 4 building jobs on the space station available, each one needs 2 kinds of ressources. Then all the minions will attempt to do the same thing, i.e., move to the ""first"" ressource, load up, and run to the first construction site. Of course, because they have the same speed, all of them will arrive there at approximately the same time at which point the 2nd to 10th minion will realize that that ressource is no longer needed because the first minion already supplied it. They will then look for another building that needs that ressource or go get another ressource. So basically there's no point assigning a lot of minions to one task because their AI doesn't realize which ressources are already being supplied. This pretty much breaks the game because time for movement is of essence in this game. The idea was good but the execution is terrible in my opinion. I assume this could have been patched to something more enjoyable in a matter of a few hours.Even if it would work a little better there's not much to do. It's pretty much a waiting game. The strategy is not very deep. The game modes available are pretty much all the same, just with easier or harder waves of enemies or no enemies at all.1/10ContentAfter you've played a game you've pretty much seen it all. If you're not completely bugged out by the broken mechanics at that point you might play a few more to get better at what you're doing, but content wise there's nothing there.1/10PlatformsAvailable on Windows, Mac and Linux/SteamOS and runs fine on the first and the last of those.10/10PerformanceThis game is almost 2d and has around 20-30 colors including shades. You can run it on a glorified toaster.10/10ExternalNo external EULA or similar crap.10/10Price (relative to content)Full price is 6.99 EUR or regional equivalent. On sale you can get it as low as 2.79 at which point I would still not get it because it has nearly no content. In my opinion you're better off playing some flash games online for free. If you desperately want to play this still, wait for it to come out in a bundle or be on really heavy sale, because my bet is you'll be disappointed.2/10DLCNo DLC.Fortunately.Other/Indie or not indieIndieFinal CommentsBelieve it or not, I like simple strategy games like this one a great deal. But this game has really disappointed in its mechanics. I don't care much for graphics, but the gameplay has to be fun, and this game brings nothing to the table at all. That being said, if you still think this might be for you, the price is relatively low as an absolute value, so you won't have to go hungry if you get it and find out it sucks just as much as I said it did.Final Personal Rating10/100Have fun in games,DNF"

The little minions you have a bit of control over are very stupid, the whole Tetris piece thing seems contrived when you can make a building then tear it down for no cost (meaning you can get to any shape you want if you have the patience), and there's no way I can see to make the next wave just start already.

As you can tell from the screenshots, it's highly abstract and pleasing to look at. What you might not be able to tell from the screenshots, though, is how attached you'll get to these little shapes. As they build new structures out of tetrominoes, as they research new monoliths, as they fend off the whirring attack shapes, you'll be rooting for them, not just because they're doing your bidding, but also because they have a right to build little lives for themselves outside of your goals as a game player."
76561198006668383,Recommended,253790,13396202,"Posted: 15 December, 2014",all,Iniyari,"...But it's a cautious recommendation. Just be forewarned that the game has limited replayability, though it wouldn't surprise me if Rymdkapsel is the kind of game that I'd play for a session of two every month for the next year.This is the kind of game that one can write a reasoned review for after just a couple of hours. The minimalist art style is at once efficient and iconic--the kind of style that, if adopted by other games, one may remark: ""Oh, yeah, that's very Rymdkapsel-ly."" A bit awkward for the mouth, but like Rymdkapsel, efficient.Rymdkapsel is a real-time, pausable strategy game in which you select from a series of 4-block segements to build a contiguous base--they call it a space station, but it would work for a variety of genres. You must manage three different resources--which, like the rest of the game, are represented by simple geometric shapes of differing colors--all of which have slightly different generation mechanics. The modules of the station are few, the minions relatively mindless, but the mechanic is tight: a stubborn completionist should get several hours out of the game before figuring out how to complete the last ""mission goal"".There's not much of a tutorial to speak of, nor multiple play modes, nor much of anything outside of the primary mechanic: ""given this limited toolset for this type of problem, how do you solve it?"" Your first two-three playthroughs may seem a bit harried, especially toward the end--warning/spoiler: don't bother trying to build anything after wave 22--but as you warm to the mechanic it'll become an exciting quandary to tackle.Much like Sudoku, this game is initially difficult to learn; one derives the most pleasure from solving it after the first 20-30 tries; but once you've got it down pat, it's much more of a lower-state-of-consciousness time sink. Not that that's bad."
