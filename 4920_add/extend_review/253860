Great graphics, sound, lengthy and thrilling campaign, awesome units (laser tanks FTW!), interesting story and setting. It's a pity that the sequels got progressively worse. The last iteration of the series (2160) was a complete disaster and the 2150 was just meh."

""Unplayable and boring"" is a harsh but accurate description that's frequent on the Steam forums.The original game is an underrated and magnificent game with great unit variability and faction balance. The missions were definitely challenging, even for seasoned players, and the adaptive AI really kept a player on their toes. The combat mechanics, friendly AI ""Generals"", resource/production nuances, and other features were well polished and supported a variety of strategic play styles.The HD version includes two Mission Packs, each with a selection of well-made missions and short campaigns, but without an AI for your opponents or friendly generals the missions just become a slog of whittling down the auto-produced horde milling about the enemy base.My recommendation is to go buy an old CD and install it on a machine that will run it instead of buying the Steam/HD version; This was a great game, and it needs to be played in a version that will do it justice."

Unfortunately the user interface and controls leave something to be desired, resulting in a bit of confusion when you are trying to build and manage your base and units.But the weakest link in the chain is the behaviour of the A.I., and its urge to accumulate as much units as possible around the base, leaving you with the challenging agenda to confront and destroy a massive defense. Especially in the first levels this kind of tactical approach can be frustrating.Achievements:The game has no Steam achievements."

This means in detail, that the AI is in kinda ""passiv mode"":- it will just attack you, if you attack them (and just the group, you attacked)- no repair at damaged buildings- no build of units or rebuild of destroyed buildingsSo to test, if the AI problem is still in this Steam version, I played the ED till level 4, because there the UCS has for the first time production buildings (one for soldiers and one for vehicles). And I can say:YES, THE AI WORKS IN THIS VERSION :)It was buildings units from both buildings and it was repairing the buildings. But yeah, I didn't checked if this is also positive for the ""rebuilding buildings""-point, because the enemy gets the necessary buildings in level 5 (which is a quite bigger map and it takes time to be able to sandwich the enemy for checking this point). But I am really sure, that the AI is doing this too :)So Yeah, HAVE FUN :D----------------------------------Das KI-Problem:Ich habe überall im Internet davon gelesen, dass die KI in Earth 2140 seit der XP-Version total im♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sein soll (ganz egal, von wo man das Spiel kauft oder welche Version man kauft). Im Detail heisst das, dass die KI quasi im ""Passiv-Modus"" ist:- die KI greift dich nur an, wenn du sie angreifst (und auch nur mit der Gruppe an Einheiten, die du angegriffen hast)- beschädigte Gebäude werden nicht repariert- die KI baut keine Einheiten und baut auch zerstörte Gebäude nicht wieder aufUm also zu testen, ob das auch für die Steam-Version zu trifft, habe ich mit der ED bis Level 4 gespielt, weil dort die UCS das erste mal Gebäude zur Einheitenproduktion besitzt (eines für Soldaten und eines für Fahrzeuge). Und ich kann sagen:JA, DIE KI FUNKTIONIERT IN DIESER VERSION :)Die KI hat von beiden Produktionsgebäuden Einheiten hergestellt und auch beschädigte Gebäude repariert. Ja ok, ich habe nicht kontrolliert, ob die KI auch Gebäude neu baut. Das liegt aber daran, dass die KI erst in Level 5 Gebäude besitzt, die auch selbst Gebäude produzieren können (denn Level 5 ist recht groß und es braucht schon etwas Zeit, bis man den Gegner umzingelt hat, um dieses KI-Problem zu testen). Aber ich bin mir sehr sicher, dass das dennoch zutrifft :)Also dann, VIEL SPAß :D"

There is no tutorial or anything like that to help new players, although watching Lets Plays and walkthroughs on youtube was helpful. Once you get over the original 'WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON' phase on first start up, it turns into an enjoyable, fast-paced RTS, even if the AI is a little dumb on normal difficulty.My main criticism, though, is the story. It's barely there and it does a poor job of letting you know what's actually going on. The text screens also show you a blink-and-you'll miss it mission objective, so make sure you give them a proper read."
,Recommended,253860,34614932,Posted: 30 August,all,Captain Titus,"DISCLAIMER: Please note I did not try multiplayer, and only played the HD version, not the original game.The progenitor of Earth 2150 and Earth 2160, 2140 remained obscure in Europe and America, due to a lack of publicity. The story is as minimalistic as it gets: two factions vying for control of a handful of territories. While the unit types are fairly varied, map and mission variety are one of the major shortfalls: the mission areas are very much the same, except for possibly some added water and a changed colour palette, while missions see you either capturing buildings, or annihilating the enemy. The other major issue is the behaviour of the AI: it can be both difficult and incredibly frustrating to break their default stance of hoarding units around their base (apparently, this is not present in the GOG version).Tentatively recommended for RTS fans looking for a different experience, or those wishing to try a strategy game from a bygone era."
,Not Recommended,253860,29107591,Posted: 7 January,all,Zestychille,"I know it's an ancient artifact of a game, but I can't handle it regardless. I'm usually pretty good about having an open mind while testing games, but this one is simply poorly designed. The game's age is no excuse. I was alive and well and played Age of Empires and the old Warcraft RTS games when they came out. They were great, and got me hooked on the genre. Went from Warcraft to AoE, to Dawn of War, and various blips online in between.My first and greatest issue is the menu. It's poorly designed, it's sloppy, and there is no clear labeling scheme for anyone who isn't already a veteran. It leaves the user to guess what each button means, and once you choose one to check there is no going back. You picked it. No menu, no known controls. Just go go go. While this would usually be enjoyable in a survival horror game, RTS is a planning sort of game. The excape button does not bring up a menu, and I pressed most buttons on my keyboard just to try to find a menu. There is no in-game menu. So once it's started you either win or lose or CTRL+ALT+DELETE the game to close it if you realize you picked the wrong option.(Edi: Read a while and found there are descrete identical buttons in the hud for different in-game functins. Sorry, but I prefer clearly labeled menus or even regular keyboar shortcuts.)Once you know how to play, the game is just fine. The mechanics are usual for it's era. The AI is usual for it's era. The graphics are usual for it's era. But the first few missions are so dumb I couldn't handle it. I did not have the patience for this game. If you played it years ago and want to see it again, get it on sale and have a great time. If you haven't played it and just want to know what it is, it's not worth the five dollars. I would put a price point of about $0.99 for this game.IF it had a clearly labeled menu where I could select a free-play option, I would have spent much more time exploring and learning the game. But the fact that it started off on a such a bad foot just contriubuted to the whlole grating experience that is Earth 2140."

The sprites are all ridiculously tiny. GUI elements seem misplaced, such as the minimap. The game allows you to set stances for units but the game is fast paced and this kind of granular microadjustment does not really work well when it is hidden in menus. The map design is full of bottlenecks which interferes with the pathfinding and can cause much more damage to your troops because they start scattering and doing silly stuff. There was no way to zoom in on the action. Emphasis seems to be on mopping up maps with units rather than on ressource gathering or basebuilding. Removed for declutter"

76561198038421632,Not Recommended,253860,13097101,"Posted: 26 November, 2014",all,Jamie Poppins,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!I have spent enough time to know that this game is truly the worst RTS game I have ever played.Good points:The graphics are okay as it does not look terrible but I only say okay because the graphics are pretty awful in the CG scenes which is to be expected but there is a difference between trying and laziness and it fits the latter.One song was genuinely good in the soundtrack, when this song came on, I never wanted it to leave as it is catchy and has that RTS feel to it.You can save anywhere because you REALLY need it in this game.aaaannnnnnddd that is about it.Bad pointsThe gameplay: The gameplay does start off like a traditional RTS game with the base building and atacking but after the first few levels, it gets very boring very quickly because building a base is tedious as well as building an army. Building a base is simple enough, find a patch to lay the transport down on to convert it into a building. And that is fine unless your base is getting attacked and for the most part, that happens constantly and it gets even worse by the end making the base building just an absolute chore. To get resources,you must mine which again sounds fine but it is annoying when you do not know where to mine because the game never tells you so you have to get the mine to search around that could actually expose itself to the enemy and it is done for then because the transports move slower than a snail.At least in good RTS games, it actually indicates where you can mine rather than guess so that is poor usability for the player there. Another thing as well is the processing of building an army as it can take up to 1 hours alone to build a huge one and even then, it can get decimated instantly by the enemy but when your army tries that, it barely damages them meaning that your army is as weak as a child and the enemy has as much armour as the fear bullies have on people so it can be done but just in a horrible way. The gameplay is an absolute mess and there have been missions where it has took me 4 hours alone to pass because of how poor the maps are meaning that the levels are longer for no reason.Let me set the scene, there is a map where 75% of it is land and the other 25% of it is water, again sounds fine. Well to get your land troops across water, you have to order these boats where they can only take 1 mech or 6 infantry units so the process is long and the water strech is not far either, we are talking 50 years here and there is even a ledge where at least the infantry could cross but no, it is not the case at all and you have to do the tedium of getting 1 group over, get the boat back to the other side and repeat. I guess I could accept that situation if it was only done in 1 mission but nope, it is set in at least 6 of the missions and cue the anger and the annoyance.Another annoying thing is how the enemy structures are built as there are rocket towers all over some parts of the map in many levels and then you have mines to deal with in the later levels. The devs were seriously mine-happy in this game as there is literally about 50 of them scattered inch by inch to each other and you can only have a miner unit to sweep them but it is as riveting as cleaning rubbish up someone else has made at a club at the end of the night, it is not fun AT ALL. There were even parts where I had to save almost every 5 seconds I did something so I can continue because resources is so limited that it can make a mission go unnecessarily complicated very quickly especially when you are down to your last few units. It is ridiculous and I should not have to do that but nope, I had to do that for several missions.AI: The AI is also awful because the enmy is just cheap because when you are taking over a base, enemies out of nowhere just appear and attack your base so you have to make sure your base is well defended otherwise it can be destroyed very fast by infantry units of all things. The AI for your team however is seriously some of the worst because when you point them to somewhere, they do get there for the most part but there have been loads of instances where the units go a different direction that could expose them or they just do their own thing such as keep moving somwhere which gets them killed and this becomes a lot more common later on in the game making the controls annoying.The music: Like I said before, there was one good song and that was it. Well unfortunately this was the case as there are only 9 songs in the whole game and there is just not enough songs here making the music monotonous very quickly after it's first loop. Unlike in Command And Conquer where you can loop a certain song over and over and the fact that the quality of the music is 100000x better than the music here is non-existent because you can choose a track but you cannot loop it over because it is already on a set path to loop the whole soundtrack over and over again, I am not impressed.And then comes the quality of the music, it is BAD and I mean bad because the songs are either too boring to listen to, too inspired to listen to, or the songs do not fit in the game at all. Seriously the one song sounds like something from a prime time TV programme for old people and does not fit this game AT ALL. If you want to make a soundtrack for an RTS, THEN MAKE IT FITTING BY GETTING THE SONG PUMP YOU UP TO TAKE DOWN THE ENEMY BASES AND NOT SONGS THAT FIT FOR GARDENING SHOWS! The music is awful, concluded.The story: Okay, I was not expecting some deep story but there really isn't one because your faction are taking over countries and that is it. What is bad is the cutscenes as they are pointless since it just shows random artillery doing something and it does not set the scene at all. When you conquer a country (via 5 missions each country), it just takes you back to the world map so you can enter another country and there is no cutscene at the end of each company and it just make me feel so empty and made me feel like I achieved nothing and I wasted my time and I really did because 40 hours on this damn game is overkill! There is just no lore to this game, no background, no idea how it came to two faction in war of each other, absolutely nothing.In conclusion, this game is not only a mess but an absolute disaster as almost nothing comes out of it and just because the price of this game is cheap, it does not mean you should buy it as you should put it on something a LOT better than rubbish. This is easily one of the worst games I have played (and that is saying something as I play lots of games) as it fails to be a RTS game, it fails to be interesting and most of all, it fails to be a playable game.Avoid this at all costs, save your money and save your time as this game just wastes it!0/10 - an absolute piece of turd"
