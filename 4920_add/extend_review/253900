On the same day.It has been many months since then, and he still plays it.Nothing but Knights and Merchants.He doesn't seem to know how to save a game. He always restarts and enjoys it alot.I told him to play this on offline mode though, otherwise I can't play my games on steam.However, it is not exaggerated if I say he played atleast 1000 hours.

I remember playing this years ago and sucking horrible at it because I was too young to be any good in strategy games but now im older and somewhat better at strategy games, spent over a 100 hours in this game because its so addicting and time consuming :)Upon purchasing and playing this game, the game kept crashing and crashing for me when using windows 7. Luckily fans made a HD remake mod for this game and I can play at without any problems, even though the remake version isnt 100% complete yet and it need some tweaking here and there. But thanks to that mod I had so much fun playing this game and the new custom maps that came with it.I defenitely recommend this to play if you like strategy games and have ALOT of time at your hands :)"
,Recommended,253900,12534568,"Posted: 17 October, 2014",all,RockstarCRO,"It's going to be difficult to explain why I've played this game for a while. I started it up the first time completely confused as heck wondering why no one was listening to my commands and quickly stopped. Decided to give it another shot and am quite happy I did... as I ended up playing for four hours straight.The AI is interesting to note on this one. Rather than telling peasants (or serfs as their called) or builders (laborers) to do exactly what to do - you are a planner and the serfs and laborers do your bidding automatically. Yes, that means that serfs and what not micro manage themselves. It can be a bit of an issue as I've noticed building 3 or more buildings sometimes can halt production, none the less though once this is addressed there shouldn't be issues. Roads need to be built to interconnect the city as well as allow serfs to travel to the job site to drop off materials for the building to be built. Laborers and serfs work closely together to accomplish the building - serfs mostly look after distribution of resources. There are A LOT - of different resources which get stored at a supply house. Bows, swords, shields, flour, corn are just the beginning of what is stored.There are different types of units military wise but the civilian crowd delivers stability to your village. Bakers can be trained, animal trainers, farmers, carpenters, wood cutters, miners etc... It can get quite crazy and overbearing at times early on in the campaign to see how much can be done with the diversity of the units.Battling is interesting and is as cool as an old style RTS can get. What is neat though which I wish other games would follow is when holding down the right mouse button, you can actually choose 360 degrees which way your troops should face. When you select a band of your troops, you are able to link up units with other units (conjoin groups) and are able to unite a bunch of units under one banner. Be it under one banner or not, you are able to rotate and position in HOW MANY lines the troops are allowed to be in. This really helps keeping a long line of infantry while keeping a band of arrows behind the infantry line.I got this game extremely cheap on sale and figured why not? Somehow for some reason, I like this game. Some of the in game perks as which way the soldier should face I found absolutely brilliant even though simple. I found myself mesmerized watching the AI serfs and laborers do my bidding and build.Is this game for everyone? Not really - you may get sucked into it like I did or you may think this is some stupid old game that should stay buried. I will recommend it as someone who is consistently looking for action in games, found myself happy with the eventual build of my village.RATING : 7.4/10GameplayBStory / CampaignBVisuals / User InterfaceCSounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityC+OverallB-ScreenShots :Soldiers need to be fed as you can see on the right (condition) while a button needs to exist to give peasants crap for standing around and pretending to not look busy"

The city-building part is fun and easy, but battles are even more fun and, despite game's simplistic looks, challenging (at least sometimes). It's hard to recommend this 15 years old game with something like ""Settlers 7"" released, but it still could deliver a lot of fun if you don't mind outdated graphics."

Ah..Anyway, nostalgia trip over, here's my views on this game.Pro's and benefits:This game has an indepth resource management system. Seriously, it's way better than anything to date. Your army can drain your economy rapidly depending on how big it is, so fielding smaller armies can be mutually better, if it may take longer to defeat your enemy.Strategy is actually required for this game. No really, it's not a case of throwing a large army of 50 spear holders against a small force of 10 swordsmen with some archers behind, because that'll just get you murdered and that's a whole bunch of gold and resources gone. It's better to have small squads of 6, 9 and 12 with occasional 16 squads appearing now and then.The nostalgic feel of this game is incredible! This game was made a good 10 years ago at the very least, maybe even earlier. Because it was made earlier and during the time that game developers actually had the balls to step outside the box and try something now, it created this game as well as many others.The Cons/painful stuff:Crash crash crash landings. This game SUCKS with the amount of crashes you can get. Seriously, there's an amazing amount of things you can do, and half of them will make you crash to desktop faster than the speed of light. (Note: this can be remedied via downloading the remake version on modDB. No free game for you though, you have to own the game to get access to the remake. Nice little touch of coding on the dev's part)Time. THIS TAKES FOREVER!!! No really, you can be there for a good few hours figuring out one single mission. It can get really frustrating and at times I need to quit and relax my mind before I blow a brain tumor.Final score:I give this game a 4/5.I'm giving it this score because considering everything that's great about this game, the crashes and amount of time it takes, as well as the sheer amount of difficulty some missions can have will result in rages and you not touching the game for a full week. However considering everything else about the game, it's really fun to play.Notice: With the remake edition, multiplayer is available as well as a few other options, not to mention the crashes are at a minimum and you can increase time to X10 so waiting on your♥♥♥♥♥no longer becomes such a dull practice. Use the remake version if you want a better game in general. (again, you must own the game before you can use anything in the remake, and even then the remake isn't complete even today, so expect a few issues)"
,Recommended,253900,7746394,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Liquidsnakehpks-joa,"Finally The game is out on steam, Knights and Merchants is a typical Strategy game Based on the feudal system in the middle ages or what we call as Feudalism, What made Knights and Merchants Stand out back then that its even alive today is that game has a strange charm about it, It has no epic story or huge cinematics but its rather simple and great implementation of the feudal system , If you have played settlers this is no strange game then, its very similar to it .What i like about Knights and merchants is that game is well paced and restricted unlike the other games like age of empires where you can build up very quickly and rush others, KAM lays down a Strong System where you need to have specifc Buildings to progress to the next one , so Unless you have a strong economy setup , there is no way to build up a army Fast and rush, It retains that cumbersome slow system Feudalism was. You can Focus on the city Builiding and then make units.It even has a feeding system where you have to feed everyone in your base constantly so , planning is very important , without the right balance people will go hungry and die eventually.Everything is simple and Influences your game in a way.Its a very unique old game , unless you master that starting tutorial the game will be impossible to play easily.There are a lot of fan based Re-makes and fixes but i recommend playing the game as it is, Its a great challenge that way, specially For those not interested in multiplayer.Do Remember to save a lot , The game tends to crash after a long stretch of gaming or music changes"

It is a nice classic game. It involves a complex economy, involving production chains of raw material to finished product like ANNO 2070, which I like. The military fights are alright (make sure you have planty of archers). The pathfinding is okay though not as responisve nor smart as the only thing that is annoying (damn you modern RTS).

The best feature has to be the multiple resources and the length it takes to produce soldiers and food.Another interesting feature of the game is that you have to consistenly feed your military units. It is difficult to slowly produce a large army to just steam roll because of the feeding mechanic.The overall game has a nice balance of managing resources that is missing in other rts games.All of this said, the game has exploitations due to it being almost 20 years old. On top of that, frequent glitches (even with fan patches) can cause the game to crash and even make a stage unwinable (due to a crash everytime something is destroyed).The game cost so little money it could be worth it, but it's glitches and slow pacing can be draining.

,Recommended,253900,18448844,"Posted: 12 October, 2015",all,rmnoob,"Great Nostalgia, as I played the original game ~2000 when I was a kid. If you already played this game, you can't do much wrong buying it again, it contains both campaigns (The Shattered Kingdom [TSK] & The Peasants Rebellion [TPR]) which should take ~50hrs of raw speedrunning if you still know the concept of the game.There is a problem though: This is NOT the original game from 2000! It's a remake with a hell of bugs and changes (esp. if you played TSK and didn't own the Gold Edition)Some things I noticed:Opposite KI is waaaaaay worse than the original game (only TSK). E.g. senseless re-adjusting of the forces which is an invitation to lure them out with an archer without much trouble. They once didn't attack for 30 seconds after my archer hit them and just ran one by one in their death. Then the next army and so on. I killed about 50 Units and didn't lose a single Platoon of guys.It's not just more buggy, the KI seems to be more passive than it used to be. I remembered some TSK missions - in Mission 4, they used to have a really vicious timing-attack pressuring a small opening in the mountains if you stood too passive and just tried to eco. The chevalry didn't even move a single feet/hoof in this remake. So lets say you have very much time just building your economy, which you didn't have in the original game and made it kinda tricky to balance economy and army.Another (quite annoying) bug is that - if you build the mercenary camp - mercenaries kinda freeze the game. Commands are delayed by ~5 seconds, which can cause big frustration in a combat. So I recommend playing TSK missions without building the mercenary camp, though the units are in some mission very useful.On the other hand, they didn't fix a giant bug concerning siege: if you click in a good rhythm at a building to attack, you need 1/2 of the time to destroy it. I found it out by accident in the old game and it's a really abusive thing, especially with the dumb KI which does not move for a big time. In one mission i just sneaked a platoon behind the lines and used that - If you split your original forced the missions would have needed maybe 10 minutes instead of 2 hours.Now while this may sound really bad, you can still play the game and have lots of fun. But you have to be your own judge: If you abuse the mistakes in the game it's a really boring Settlers-spin-off. If you play honest some missions still are kinda tricky, especially in TPR. The story is great, the games brings many old feelings and the music still is nice (though not the same as in the original game, which I liked more)For under 5€ definetely a must-have!"

While the graphics aren't great compared to modern titans, they were some of the best when this game first came out. It's a great example of classic old school rts/micromanagement. While the gameplay is a bit unusual, you learn most of the mechanics of it through the campaign.Skirmishes are great for practicing and for goofing off with ideas. The ability to organize your soldiers in rows and columns is nice, and allows you to better place your soldiers in small places.On the downside, if you don't like having to build each individual building and creating each specific unit for each building, then this game is not for you. If you like to micromanage everything, then have fun, you'll enjoy it.Overall I give it a 4/5.

Unlike warcraft though, these maps can take forever since you have to start from a store house and make all your resources from food to weapons to character units nd army units. The combat in this game is much more complicated as well, forcing you to attack more strategicaly rather than just trying to zerg rush. On a lot of maps when you are given starting troops, with the proper attack strategies, you can take out your enemies with just the starting troops. The maps are long and pretty tedious but watching your town flourish is so addicting and the great music will keep you entertained the whole time. It is by far not without its flaws though, the original game's AI is pretty dated and while everything will work fine just working towards your goal, if you try dominate the map your serfs will kill themselves trying to walk across the map when an inn is right next to them. Also this HD version for some reason lacks the super fun music the original had. There are mods for this game online offering enhanced AI and other awesome features worth checking out."

On one hand, the town creation system is very engaging and highly enjoyable... But, if you are looking for an alternative to Age of Empires, then you have come to the wrong neighbourhood.The combat systems in this are EXTREMELY finiky, and attempting to give quick orders to your troops in the heat of battle is almost impossible. The Archers in this game are definitely the most unresponsive units i have ever tried to control in a strategy game. 90% of the time, when I try to tell my archers to shoot some approaching axe-men, they merely run up to the axe-men and let the axe-men kill them. One such time was when I was attempting to order my archers to fire into a battle, over a mountain, which they have the range to do. No matter what I did, half of my men would start shooting, the other half would run around the mountain and sit there and allow themselves to be killed. I assumed that it was because they were out of range. So, i loaded a previous save and tried again, only this time, I split up the archers into 2 different groups, keeping all of the ones that had been shooting before, in place and telling the others to sit and look pretty... Half of the firing group ran around the mountain and got themselves killed...The melee units are a little better, but a lot of the time, just trying to order them to form ranks will have one of them charge off into the enemy, ala Learoy Jenkins. Other times, they will ignore your orders completely, specifically, one time when I was down to my last axe-man in the enemy base, and I was ordering for him to start attacking a building, he merely stood next to the building and focussed on killing serfs (Sorry, little buddy, but peasants only count in the event of a draw.)That being said, when the game IS performing how you want it to, it is actually very satisfying. Bottlenecking your opponents on a bridge with a bunch of axemen with archers behind them, showering your opponents with arrows, whilst they bounce off of the axemens shields, like in 300, is a very fun thing to do.One last thing to note is that, the combat is somewhat fair, because the enemy AI appears to have much the same problems controlling it's own troops.I love this game, but oh my god, the combat just makes me want to pull my hair out.If you are looking for a medieval style Sim-City, however, I would highly recommend it, because this is one of the most satisfying games to build a vast, thriving city.Don't get me wrong. I love this game a lot, but I can't, in good conscience, recommend it. If you want a Medieval strategy game, get Age of Empires. If you want a Medieval city building simulator, buy Banished."

A prince had take overthe kingdom, and you will have to conquest it and liberate your people.When you try to know why this game hasn't the recognition it deserve, you will find that he was launch at the same time as Age of Empire. This is the reason why the big marketing machine had shadowed one of the biggest strategy game of all time : Knights and Merchants.I'm a total fan of the game, trying to create every town with the right urban organisation, avoiding starving and creating the best scheme for wining. Each level is original, and you have to make every time a new strategy : Enhance you food supply, securise raw material, make warrior as fast as possible to support your allies.As an old game, there are some bugs, but guess wgat, they are more funny than anything else : Ennemy's Ghost Town, Ennemy do not feed it's soldier sometime and makes it easy to win. Those type of bugs can happen 1 time on 99.But this game is one of the best strategic game ever.I recommed it if you love strategy games and if you have the time to play it. It can take between 15 minutes and 5 hours to beat a level. Yes, you read it, 5 HOURS, and it's worth it, looking at you army detroying the ennemy building. A great satisfaction20/20."

Sprite animations, nice music, line manufacturing, attention to details, colorful environments and buildings, art of war... It really has everything. And it was game of my childhood as well. I used to play game without fast forwarding and missions took hours, days to play, and it was still more fun than most of today games. There were other games like Settlers but none managed to capture magic of this game. And it aged pretty well i think. Other major factor in the game is strategy... there are no health bars and with 10 men in right position you can kill 100 other men.Game is total pro, but for con I would probably put animations between missions which were quite bad even for that time. And maybe repetitive game play... although it is not repetitive as it looks like. If you are cunning enough and have great strategy, you can win many missions without constructing a single building. Other con I can think of is hard game play (for beginners) as the game is quite non-forgiving when it comes to wrong choices, and poor micro management. But again, it is also a kind of an advantage since you perfect your game play like that.Overall, one of not so popular classics."

It was the first one I ever played and was thrilled to find it again on Steam. A word of warning beforehand; get 'Kamremake' (after buying the legit copy ofcourse) or run the patch which is mentioned often in the reviews/discussions for the best experience. You can expect higher resolutions, better zoom-options, scrolling, more accurate point-and-click gameplay as well as more options besides the campaign(s).What can you expect? A challenging RTS wherein you must manage your economy, borders and army well. Yes, it comes with a few quircky/iffy, particularly when it comes to positioning your squadrons. This takes a little practice, but when you get a hold of it you certainly do not need to outmatch your opponents in numbers. Make use of the terrain, funnels and some 'body pulling' to decimate armies. The first two missions do well enough to teach you these basics. From there on it ramps up the difficulty incrementally, both in terms of the might of your opponents as well as the mission type (open map versus say an entrapment mission). By far the most challenging missions are those that keep you on a tight timer before you get overwhelmed.Disregarding the option to speed up the game, prepare to spend hours per game/map as in the olden days. Combined with the music and the sounds of productivity emitting from your bustling settlement this is ideal when coupled to getting some work done or other chores around the house."

,Recommended,253900,34713180,Posted: 3 September,all,Sun Kenshin,"This is a great old RTS game that I ever played. It is a RTS game with realistic features together with stupidity :pWhat you need to play this game is a micro-military management and patientLet's see the overall.Graphic: The graphic was ok but think about it that it was a game created around Win95 or Win97. It is acceptable for me.Control: Simple UI. You can only move your military. Labourer and Slave will move according to your build plan and need. Other characters will move according to their role.Game Pace: Very slow if you want to have a big army and grand city. It will take you more than 2-3 hours per map. However, once I get used to it, I can finish some maps within 30 mins without having to build the whole city with army micro-management.City Construction: If you want to build a block of road, once you clicked on the map, your labourer will come and adjust the land. Then a slave will come with a block of stone. After that, your labourer will finish a block of road. As for the building, labourer will adjust the whole plot. When the road connected to the entrance of the building, your slave will start building it. However, if you build another roads or land plot, the labourer will move there to adjust the land and build the road. So, you can't build a whole city in one go.resource: In this game, the fundamental resources are almost unlimited. Wood can be planted which will be turned to timber. Wheat can be planted over and over again. However, you should build the building in order as in one map, I forgot to build the saw mill and focus on the food to feed my army. As a result, I can't build any building at all as all the timbers are used in farming.Food is matters. Your citizen can starve to dead if there is no food.MilitaryMelee: Once the melee battalion engages the enemy, they won't back down until all the enemy or your battalion are annihilated. If you want to flee, you have to hope that the remainings are not engage the enemy. The soldiers is very loyal to your command. If you command them to destroy the building, if the enemy hit them from behind, they won't fight back and keep attacking the building LOL. If you run into the bigger army, bye.Cavalry: Unlike your foot soldiers, the calvary will not chase down the enemy. I like to hide them somewhere when the archer units pass and strike them.Archer: I like this unit unit and mechanism a lot. It is very realistic. Your archer was trained to fight in the long range, so if the enemy close in, the archer won't fire any single arrow. There are eight directions for your army to form a line. Your archers can't fire the enemy if they can't see! This mean if your archer units face to the east and the enemy comes from the west, say goodbye to your archer.....So, the battle is as simple as it seems like melee at the front, archer from behind. BUT, if you make a wrong move, you have to take a pain-relieve pill. However, with the good plan you can win over an army of 500 by just only 50-100 soldiers. Or in one map, I won over the huge army by killing a farmer, without food, all the soldiers were starved to dead.In conclusion, if you have a lot of free time, try this game and your time will be gone....."

If this game is new to you, it will be incredibly frustrating.  To create your economy, you are forced to build your buildings in a specific order.  There is no wiggle room, the game will only allow you to create building type 15 after building type 14, but only after you built 13, and so on.  It's a tedious process, and it takes your serfs about 4 minutes to build each building if everything goes smoothly, which it never will.  Serfs get stuck in roads...a lot.  The end goal of a healthy economy is to build a large enough army to beat the overwhelming forces of your enemy.  If you lose the 30-40 troops you are assigned at the beginning of the mission, it will probably take 1-2 hours to replace that army, and that may not be enough to kill the 300-400 enemies that you will be facing.  Also, winning a battle is always going to involve having one of your archers lure the enemy force into your carefully prepared army lines with militia in the front and archers in the back.  Over and over and over again.  That is the only strategy that you are expected to use or that will work.  You have to be quick about it too, because your troops will get hungry and have to be fed about every 15 minutes or they will die, which means you need tons of food and plenty of serfs to walk the food all the way across the map to feed your massive army.  Once in battle, the controls are clunky, the soldiers are incredibly hard to direct, and the archers must be positioned perfectly or they will be unresponsive.  If you do get this game, save your game a lot, because you do not want to lose many of your soldiers in battle.  Each soldier is a huge investment in time and resources. The game crashes a lot as well, there seems to be an issue with the sound causing crashes, so you may want to turn the sound off.  Be prepared for a lot of micromanagement and 20 very long levels in both campaigns."

Now, let me first dispell the theory that this game is only played because of nostalgia, as I have played it a good deal and am looking forward to continue playing it for some time, and had never heard of this game as of a few days ago. Okay, now on to the review. This game is a solid base-building strategic RTS, and has a good deal of depth to it. First of all,  I will say that the HD version has a few bugs and issues, but overall is a good substitute for the original (you get both). I will say that they took out a few random things like fishing, the tutorial is a horrible failure so go to the original for that, and in my oppinion the UI is a bit weaker because it shows you everything tech-wise when you load in, instead of revealing new branches of tech as you progress (you'll understand what I mean when you play, because you dont know what buildings are available until you unlock tech needed prior to building it in the original). Anyway, aside from that, I really enjoy this game. Though controlling units in combat can be a little difficult, I think that the intricacies of how you need to have a chain of buildings to make food, and little things like having to send food out to your units over time make up for the lack of a superior control system for your armies. Its fun how you have to manage everything in your civilization, and how you could very well starve if your roads  get too clogged (this happened to me once, it was tragic). Overall, this game has a lot going for it, and even today- excluding the fact that it came out in the 90's, I would pay at least $10 for Knights and Merchants, much less 90 cents!! Just buy the game okay? What is the worst possible scenario? You lose out on a 90 cent investment (or $5 for those who arent participating in the sale- but come on, its a great game!)."

We would start in the morning, and before we knew it, it was getting dark. Its not so noticable on the first few levels, but towards the end, you looking at some long games. I loved this game, and recommend everyone gets it. But if you start playing it, and suddenly realise its tomorrow, don't say I didn't warn you.Get KaM remake. The base game only has resolutions 800 x 600 and 1024 x 768. KaM remake allows a lot more, and you can even run in windowed mode if you so wish. The mod is compatible with this version, details and downloads are available athttp://www.kamremake.com/If you liked the origional Settlers games (before 5) you will love this. (Personally I don't think much of the Settlers games, but that could be because I played this first).KaM has more micromanagement than most strategy games that are not built around it (see the Tropico series and any of the Tycoons (Railroad, Rollercoaster, Airport, Lemonade Stand etc etc etc)), and contains a much more strategic realtime combat system, where you can't just constantly throw units away at your opponent until they crumble.As a comparison to other strategy games lets look at food.Most strategy games you need farms; food is now sorted.KaM has 3 food types; bread, sausages and wine.Bread requires; a Wheat farm, a Windmill, and a Baker.Sausages require a Wheat farm (to feed the pigs on the...) Swine Farm and a Butcher.Wine requires only a Vineyard.However, so your non-military units eat, you need atleast 1 Inn. (The Inns can sit either 6 or 8 people I can't recall exactly so if you have a lot of non-militants you need more than 1 Inn...but you wont have to worry about that until later in the base game (Shattered Kingdom)).5 useful tips. (Contains what some would consider a spoiler)1: Ignoring military, I generally recommend 3 serfs for every 2 buildings. Its not exact but works well enough for the most part.2: For highest efficiency each farm should have 14 fields close by.3: On the first combat only mission STOP ALL YOUR UNITS. They will be slaughtered very quickly as they enter a valley. You will be fighting a much larger force, but use your head and you can do it.4: Save often in different slots. This game is very unforgiving and something you did or didn't do an hour ago can make all the difference now.5: Treat every military unit as Sacred. They can be costly and just a plain arese to replace."

76561197995232114,Recommended,253900,12847662,"Posted: 8 November, 2014",all,Daximil,"A very underrated classic game. I originally bought this game when it was first released and it has never gotten the recognition I felt it deserved. This is a Real-time-strategy game for players who enjoy playing the civilian/production side of the RTS experience, so if you're the kind of player who wants to build a massive army and kick butt with very little regard for your work force then you should look somewhere else. But if you want to build a complex city with charming buildings and likeable workers going about their jobs, then prepare for a real treat.Pros-A complex city construction system. If you want to train a soldier, you must first hire a recruit, build the weapons and armor they will use, and manufacture the components used to make the weapons and armor with first. And of coarse, this process requires buildings and workers for every stage of construction. Enjoy the process! :)-The graphics and animations are charming. They are old-school, but charming.-Population size is only limited by food production. You can keep growing your population for as long as you have the mats, but if you don't have the food to feed them with, you will be looking at a massive starvation die-off.-A wide variety of types of workers for doing different jobs. Builders build. Serfs carry resources to where they are needed. Farmers grow crops. Blacksmiths craft armor. etc. etc.Cons-The game's tech-tree is more rigid (unforgiving) than I would like. You start the game with a certain amount of resources. And if you use up a particular resource before you've built the ability to produce more, then you might as well restart the round. This is especially true of gold, which is used for hiring new people. If you run out of gold before hiring a miner to mine gold with, you're town is permanently plateued.-Very difficult to maintain a large standing army, because you need to feed them. And every piece of food you're giving to a soldier is a piece of food you aren't giving to a worker. And you only benefit from soldiers for as long as you are fighting. Large armies can cause massive starvation die-offs if you don't manage things properly.-The player really needs the ability to grab a worker and give him a direct order to do something NOW, instead of waiting for their Ai to get around to doing it.-The Ai gets confused in an extremely long game. (13 hours or so) It works great for a long time, and then suddenly serfs start delivering mats to other people's cities (this works for you as much as against you), units start forgetting how to do their jobs, etc.-Ability to command your military is a little unforgiving. Once your army meets the enemy, you won't be able to give them any commands until after they are done fighting.OverallThis is one of my all time favorite RTS games. It's even withstood the test of time!If I could get an RTS with this games' work force and city construction combined with Warlords Battlecry's military and hero system, I'd be in heaven. :)"

,Recommended,253900,10728389,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,Executioner_MonoXide,"Knights and Merchants is one of those games I grew up with, how ever saying that I have put allot of time into the game. Compared to the old version I have on the CD format the Steam version of it seems to be easy to gather food (by adding in the fishers hut) and dose have some fix's to the builders where they would stop working after you grew to fast. Though with this the steam version also made it longer on the missions compared to the old game.To those who never played this classic I would highly recommend this to you, the game is based on building your town and getting an army up fast. Though if you grow your town to fast you will lose, you need to have about 6 farms, 6 wine farms, around 3-4 pig farms and 2-3 mills that will take care of your food for most of the game and lets you get plenty of pig skins to make the better units. I would also like to add that you need about 5 or wood cutters. You will run out of wood and stone fast, on the other levels once you get to about half point of the game you will need to get gold, I would say rush to that asap.There is also a trick to winning the maps with out losing to much men, you make a single bow unit and put him close by to enemy units wait for them to come out of there base to attack your unit, then with draw him back to your line (that needs to be near by). With this tactic you can wipe out there main force. Sometimes this will not work if you don't have the right units to do it. Most maps will last you 2-4 hours so make sure you have time, and that you make 2 saves (one at the start of the level encase you screw up, and a mid map save or a save when you need to take a break). The game dose take time in fact allot of time, I have not beat the steam version and made it to the last level on the old school version before my old 497Hhz died.Over all Pros and Cons:Pro's*Game has much needed fix's such as the builder’s bug and the resource bug.*The AI dose not rush you as much as the old version (except on a few maps with just fighting units).*You are able to do a mid map rush if you are a vet of the game.*Added single maps where you can play AI with out the missions however you can not set up teams and the AI is highly lacking.Con's*The music is not the best is not the original and will sometimes lock up.*The sound file's of the game will sometimes skip if you have the music on which can lock up the sounds.*Increased the games time for most maps where it will take you an extra hour.Over all I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys games like AOE (Age of Empires), Warcraft III. It is well worth the price of the game."

You can build big cities and raise armies. Because of the ''build chain'' you will always have to work hard for your resources: you need a farm for grain, then a mill for flour and a baker for the bread. This system makes you always want to expand. The armies itself are not really my thing. For those who do like that sort of thing KAM has a fun army system, meaning you have to work really hard to sustain an army, food, supplies, recruits, workshops etc. And if you want to disable enemies i recommend you just google Knights and merchants map editor/mission editor.

But in that time its lost none of its magic and its fantastic to see it here on steam.First off, the economy is excellently simulated; you need to quarry stone and cut wood to have building materials - then you must build farms/vineyards/pig farms to have raw ingredients for your millers, bakers, sausage makers etc to turn into food for your population.Army construction follows a similar theme - mining of coal and ore, followed by smithing into weapons. Recruits are trained and turned into soldiers. Thus the conquest commences.Defeating your foe is a little more standard-RTS-esqe - take your men, beat his men, destroy his stuff. Yet tactics are very important in the game - you'll need a blend of men, bowmen, swordfighters, pikemen etc - to successfully take out your foe.Although this micromanagement sounds cumbersome, the game is actually very streamlined and within a short period of time your base/town is up and running and you can focus on fighting your enemy.Brilliant retro game you can spend hours on"

The game has two aspects: townbuilding and combat. Ultimately, though, it's all about combat; the townbuilding is just there to facilitate your armies.That's unfortunate, because the combat is terrible, and here's why:- Controls are clunky.- Pathfinding is abysmal- Units will barely move in formation- Archers will only fire if the enemy is coming from a certain direction- Units can move off the map, killing them- Bad pathfinding and inconsiderate level design mean that this will happen repeatedly!- Units get hungry (which is pretty cool), but when you supply a troop the hungry unitss aren't prioritised, so they starve to death while their well-fed friends are getting stuffed with sausages.The list goes on. All this is just from the first level! In fact, combat is so terrible I had to restart the combat tutorial at least four times to not get slaughtered.If you like townbuiling with a little bit of combat, try Caesar or CivCity: Rome; if you like the peasant-and-pike combat, with a bit of town management on the side, play Stronghold. Either way, save yourself the ragequit and don't buy this."

There is only one defensive building which has an incredibly short range, and quite a few buildings you aren`t told how they even work. I realize this is from`98, but c`mon!

Why? Because it's too unnecessarily realistic. If your troops need food (i.e. bread), you need  farm wheat, process it to make flour and finally make the bread. Thus, there's an arduous process behind every single item that must be done.That's why KAM is so magnificently wonderful! ٩(o´  ▽  `o)۶ ♥"

The game itself gives you the storyline set in England. I can not tell anything bad at this game as it was my most favourite game in childhood and though this new HD version has got a bug with rotating the army, I can manage to turn them otherwise. I know a lot about this game so I simply recommend this game to everyone who likes solid strategic game.You can build the infrastructure, your own army and some missions are pretty challenging and at the end rewarding. But enemy AI is sometimes very stupid. Your own units will be stuck when the city is crowded so you must think in front. Make gaps between buildings, roads. Set inn at the corner of the town, castle outside the town. Do not forget to supply your people with lots of food and you can raise great armies. You can also download map and mission editors which are functional.I could play multiplayer only with legal game (you download KaM Remake), that is why I bought it and since then I admire the game even further. Playing against other players is more challanging."

76561198041204582,Not Recommended,253900,26498260,"Posted: 8 November, 2016",all,mattanja.bakker,"So  after playing a couple of hours it is time to put down some thoughts about this game.The main reason i purchased this game on Steam is for nostalgia reasons as i played K & M back in the ""good"" old days.Right from the start i unfortunately have to say that i do not recommend this games except maybe for nostalgia reasons.Here`s why:In a nutshell the games does not hold up to modern standards or even the standards of other economy-focussed strategy games (Anno series or the settlers IV to name examples).Singleplayer:The game comes packaged with a campaign about a kingdom in peril which the player has to save. The story is decently told and the missions are relatively varied in terms of startup, objectives and focus changes between battles and town building.  My main issues concern the gameplay itself. Some of these issues do play a role in multiplayer as well.First of all every time a player starts a SP or MP match from scratch and has to build a town he is only allowed to build 1 building in the beginning. As soon as that building is finished another building is unlocked, followed by another upon completion. In itself i don`t mind a progression system however this design decision leads to immediate boredom as it takes several minutes to construct the first building and the player can do nothing but watch. There is nothing else to do.... only after the 3rd building is constructed several more are unlocked and the game actually starts.My next issue concerns the actual construction of the buildings. All buildings require a road connection so building material can be brought to the site as well as the transportation of goods etc. after the building is constructed. In theory this is a good idea. However there is now way to prioritize buildings so the player is forced to wait for the more important building to be finished before ordering the next one. This problem is worsened by the fact that the Laborers (may also be referred to as builders) always prioritize roads. So if you have a finished road and all materials present at a building site but are constructing a road on the other side of the town your laborers will first move to the other side to finish the road. Again this means that the player is forced to wait as prioritizing buildings is impossible.Furthermore your town is unprotected untill the barracks are constructed and recruits have been trained. Again this is not too bad. However if your opponent is quicker and attacks with even 1 soldier there is nothing you can do as he can basically prevent you from building a barracks by killing off the builders.  There is no way your people are going to be fast enough once you spot the enemy soldier. Regarding the defensibility i prefer the way Settlers IV handled it. That games used a tower system which made the defender a bit stronger than the attacker. That way it is impossible to be overrun by one unit.The last issue i can think of is that players cannot prioritize which material or goods should be transported first.Multiplayer:K & M on steam is playable in two modes: HD and ""normal"". The HD mode does not support multiplayer hence this section will refer to the standard version.The multiplayer has a variety of maps as well as two modes (Battle or build a town) in which the objective is to defeat the enemy by destroying their town and/or troops and is playable by up to 6 players.However the multiplayer is close to being unplayable as it is prone to desynchronisation. Up till now every multiplayer match i played desynced and even worse the game doesn`t notify the players when the match is desynchronised. This leads to much time being wasted as players are unable to see or interact with the soldiers of the other player.In summary: A lack of control, initial boredom when starting a match some poor design decisions, vulnerability and multiplayer desynchronisation issues are the reasons why i cannot recommend this game."

It is a game that focuses heavily on micro management, where failure to balance your production of things like food, materials and layout with your population growth can destroy your chances of winning a level.A unique thing about this game is the only units you physically select and control are your soldiers. All workers (Serfs & Builders) and all tradesman such as stone and wood cutters, farmers, butchers etc will automatically take up residence in an empty and suitable building or deliver materials and construct building depending on what profession you recruit them as.This system creates for a unique ecosystem where the streets are filled with your units fulfilling their tasks. In this ecosystem one of the most important units is the Serf. It is his job to pickup and deliver all goods and materials to where it is needed. For example he will take stone and wood to construction sites, pickup logs and take them to the carpenter or storage if no carpenter is available. So as your town expands you need to maintain enough of these guys, but they are also another mouth that needs feeding.Every unit needs to be fed including soldiers, The villagers will simply goto the inn and you will see them feasting on things like bread, wine and sausages which you must maintain a sufficient supply of or your people begin to starve and die.One thing is never liked is how slow things happen in this game. Some of the later missions can take quite a few hours, as by default the enemy always begins with a much larger army and self sufficient base with what would appear to be infinite supplies.Overall i like this game because of how involved it can get but balance is definitely a bit of an issue and these days it's too time consuming and old hat for me to be comfortable getting back into.I do recommend it to those who enjoy micro management, but it is certainly not for everyone and can feel pretty slow and boring at times. If you need a fast pace of gameplay don't buy this."

I've been playing it since I first got the German disc around 15 years ago. It's nice to be playing in English and have additonal missions and features. As always, this game contains so many glitches that will sometimes make gameplay impossible and you just have to restart the mission. I can't even play The Peasant's Rebellion because of a major glitch in the first mission. However, other people seemed to have gotten past this. Overall, it's a really fun game whether it's building the town and supplies as efficiently as possible, or going to war. For me, it's so much less of a war game than about maximizing efficiency and strategy. I'm a girl and I don't really like any other typically male game.

I love how you need to manually feed soldiers out in the field, leaving your base temporarily understaffed. I love how your village can get clogged up with servants due to bad city planning. Its amazing and I havent found anything close to this in all these years.Is the AI stupid? Yes. Can some levels be a total drag? Yes. Is this game worth it in the end?
