,Recommended,253920,9411040,"Posted: 10 March, 2014",all,Whiteswart,"Old school turn-based squad tactical game released in 2000.Why buy it? If you haven't seen this game before, well, it's not as famous as Jagged Alliance or Incubation, but it was very good at given time. It costs little and there are coupons up to 90% - almost to cost of sip of water.Pro: Good tactics of small squad (3-5 members) based on fair balance and well-made short maps. Note that it's a close combat game, there are no gauss rifle to solve the problem from distance. You'll need to count every shot and use cold steel in every fight. It feels like survival games like resident evil 2&3, but with turn-based battle system.Cons: in year 2014 RE2-styled product look awful. Gorky 17 is playable, but some of new gamers might have their eyes bleed from first sight. The story, especially basic one (english version), is vague at its best, and klükva in general. AI is not that good, some of us will overcome this game easily.All in all, it's a fair 7.5/10 in my line. I'd give it more, but good balance was made out of killed realism.PS: It almost hit 15 years age mark! That means you can run it on very dull config! But, no matter how good is your CPU and GPU, there will be 640x480 resolution and damn large pixels. It runs on Win7 with no trouble at all, just pick the right stroke on videoconfig before starting the game.PS for russians: Game contains right translation (Made by Snowball studio - not Goblin's Gorky18). So you have two games in one: for NATO or for good old Specnaz, since translation made a big difference in all dialogs in game."

First of all i dont care about graphics so my review will be positive.Gorky 17 is the game in which you must to think in every battle and especially in begining you must save ammo as much as you can. I saved too much and in the end had plenty of ammo. And you must to choose the best route how to complete stage.I liked how the surroundings of maps was drawed and i liked the story and characters too.So buy this if you like turn based strategy, rpg and dont care about graphics.

While simplistic in it's design, Gorky makes up for it with solid, challenging gameplay and an intriguing plot which won't require a lot of time to invest in seeing through to the end. Minor glitches appear, a gamebreaking one in the third last fight which makes completing the game tricky. The game has aged a little poorly and you may find yourself rolling your eyes when it comes to the voice-acting, cutscenes will stutter and blink, and creature designs suffer from the poor graphic quality. Other than a few hiccups Gorky 17 is a quality title, and a steal at the small price tag this halloween sale (only a dollar and four cents)."

You have to use your mind as often to overcome the challenge. Only con is cutscene is being bugged with window 8 but I don't care. Point is gameplay and storyline in during game is truly amazing, and brutal challenging. Ammo and Medkits is very rare. After beating it.

Be sure that the graphics are dated, but this is not the reason you play this game.The Game Centers around a NATO Command team that tries to uncover the mystery of the disappearance of another group.While uncovering its secrets you roam a city that was designed with attention to detail and encounter enemies at different points of the map. There is a large variability of enemies and cool boss enemies.The battles are faught in a round-based fashion, which is the aspect that makes this game so dear to my heart. Your group members (that change during the game based on its story) gain experience with the weapons they use increasing their effectiveness. They also level up and you can influence their attributes (like Luck, Accuracy, Chance of Coutner Attacks etc).The maps are fight layed out using squares and usually offer some possibilities to retreat from enemies so that you are not standing too tight. They often also offer coverage or objects like explosives that can be used to your advantage.The game is sometimes quite challanging because ammo can not be found in aboundance, so tactical thinking and choice of weapon is a must.In conclusion I have to say that I can only warmly recomment this game to anyone who likes old school tactical RPGs and is not too put-off by the dated graphics."

It has a great atmosphere even with its outdated resolution. The music is great and to me the background graphics still have their quality. The voice-acting is pretty bad but tolerable, nothing too distracting. The story is nothing special but it does manage to keep you interested and immersed. I also like the cutscenes used to introduce the boss enemies.The good thing about the gameplay is that it really needs you to think about your strategy. You'll almost always be short on ammunition and meet new enemies which require different tactics. The boss battles can be frustrating, but quite satisfying when you manage to get a victory.Get it, especially when it's on sale (which it is very often)."

Bad voice acting, rough polygonal graphics, and iffy combat system can drag this game down for a lot of people. But for the few who wish to take on this unusual, potential cult classic, give it a try. Where the game falters are immediately compensated for by where it succeeds. A smooth fusion of RPG and survival horror, an intriguing story, wicked creature designs, more-than-suitable atmosphere and soundtrack, and well-developed strategic gameplay make Gorky 17 a flawed bundle of late-90's sci-fi horror goodness."

Lots of stuff and weapons to find, helping us to shoot/smash/burn monsters, from a simple baseball bat up to Ionic rifles. Pretty slow at the begin, but if you can get through it will become more and more intensive.TL;DR game with terrible graphs but with amazing gameplay, worth buying especially on a sale.Btw a tip for people playing it on a system newer than XP, since they couldn't run it in any possible way. this game won't run unless you will use Software Renderer in the options menu. This will make your graphics settings terrible, but it's the only option to play it on Vista/7/8, at least from what I've seen."

Comes with an okay story (which is far more than most games of the last decade), pretty decent graphics for its age, and requires you to actually think to play.- Often on sale, you can get it for less than a soda. Soda lasts you 20 minutes, Gorky will last you ~10 hours. Great deal.- When it launches, you have to select what you use to run the graphics.

,Recommended,253920,10112793,"Posted: 14 May, 2014",all,RedShadow,"Gorky 17 (Odium in North America) is a turn by turn strategy game.You will start with 3 guys from NATO and your objective is to rescue another team (Group 1) that HQ has lost communication with. The city is full of monsters and that's the game's main attraction: wasting them. As you can guess, the game's story is average.The voice acting is okay. Dialogs are sometimes ""funny"" even though most of them are cliché, as are the characters. The team boss is Canadian and tries to help people and goes right to the point. Another guy is Polish, has a funny broken English and he wants to blast everything. And the last dude is French and is -- of course -- an unbelievable wimp. Well... all of this is not that great either.During the combat phase, you will have trouble to see the tiles as they are transparent glowing green squares. It is also hard to visualize the opposition's move range as it has the same color and style. Also the overview is not isometric. Sometimes a weird camera angle prevents you from having a clear sight of what's going on. Crates and other stuff will block the view and those lovely glowing tiles. If you are not careful, you will end up clicking on the wrong tile and wasting a move. Or worse. In other words the combat phase is very clumsy.When you are not shooting stuff, you are exploring the map. Every time you will spot a glowing crate -- which contains supplies like medpacks, ammo, etc. -- there will be a battle nearby. There is pretty much one crate per battle. Always. Whether the battle starts when approaching it or right after you emptied its content and went through a door or something nearby, a battle event occurs. Oh yeah I forgot: battles are scripted. There are no random encounters.During this epic adventure, various people will join your team. It's all fine and all. Except that when they have to leave your awesome NATO team because they… uh feel like it or just because they die or whatever, they will simply disappear... along with all the stuff you gave them! Say goodbye to the shiny armor, handgun, precious ammo, etc. The inventory is NOT transferred to one of your guys. Save often, so that when they leave you can load a previous save, and empty their inventory.But this is quite a problem as the ammo is scarce. The game is quite hard if you use firearms. The limited amount of ammo pushes you to use melee weapons. At first you won't have a choice but to shoot creeps. However, a taser and a tranq gun will help you freeze those turds for a couple of turns while you beat the sht out of 'em.The taser among other weapons like the flamethrower, have unlimited ""ammo"". But, they have a cool down: like 3 turns to fire/shoot again. That means that when two of your goons have a taser or such other weapon, you will be able to keep a monster “tranquilized” forever. Just wait for the cool down to be over to tase the mofo again with the other guy.So... basically a battle goes like this: analyze which scum to tase first, rush him with all of your guys, and melee him like a bunch of hooligans. Crowbar, baseball bat, axe. Yeah. The battles are hence, not very interesting. However there are some cool ""weapons"" like calling for an airstrike, an electric beam, and all kind of other crazy tools.Let’s talk about bugs now. I had an inventory bug were a key item disappeared between saves. I had to restart the game as I couldn’t open a freaking door without it. Also the game cannot start on modern computer due to the old graphic ""engine"" -- if we can call it that way. However, fear not (or not that much) as there are a few different gorky17.exe builds in the game folder that you can try. Copy/paste/overwrite the original .exe with one of them and try to run the game. Disabling the hardware zoom is however pretty much always recommended.On an old computer with WinXP and a crappy graphic card that has barely 3D acceleration, I had no problem running the game. It was flawless. However Win 8.1 x64 + GeForce GTX 770 the game crashed. Using the software only build + choosing software renderer was making the game super freaking slow. Even with my quad core i7 4770k. So I was back to my WinXP.All in all I must have spent 10 to 15 hours of gameplay. Not that bad. But the overall experience was barely average. I’m hesitating whether thumbing this down or not. I had fun with this game. I wasn’t playing that seriously anyway and still ended up with shtton of ammo.Hmmm… lets thumb it up."

The atmosphere and how every battle is unique really makes you want to play more and more.Unique weapons, unique enemy types, bosses in every corner, it will make you fear for your life every time, or want another 30 health packs just in case, even though you wont be needing it, thats the kind of fear the game places on you, you never know what to expect next and you will want to be ready every time.The story is cool, but ends in a cliff hanger, I guess because there is a prequel and a sequel (which aren't on steam).This is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time.The main flaw now is being able to run it. It doesn't work that great on modern systems, and I had to change it to the Intel HD graphics to make it work, which is a shame how publishers just release stuff on steam without fixing it."

So you can guess what to expect.Now to the main point, the game is HARD, very HARD, i mean at least the first time you do it, not knowing when combats happens, sparing any ammo you can, any bandage.. It's like a non stop boss fight (with an opening movie each time) and you're always on the breach, so this and the overall difficulty, the fact that 1 knockdown and its game over, is the good point.The bad point is technically, the  camera make this even harder in the bad way, you will often shoot your teamates miss you target or run when you dont want to, without any possibility to cancel, and finally flying monster do not appear on the ground with any shadow or anything, making them awfully hard to deal with.As i list the default, one more would be the ia.. the ia is actually in some aspect too good. I should film a combat with humanoids, its hillarious, its like playing chest with computer, you cant touch them, except if you sacrifice something.So in the end, great ""little"" game, took me almost 20h in a row, when i only wanted to give try.  9/10, no wait.. for 50ct 10/10"

As said before, the plot certainly is not the game’s major selling point. The bulk of the dialogue consists of your burly man-soldiers either grunting action-movie clichés or stating the obvious, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have a soft spot for this ragged band of gun-toting alpha males by the end.Graphically, the game is a mixed bag. The 3D models and animations are a clunky collection of fist-sized pixels while the FMV sequences look like someone made a stop-motion video with LEGO puppets. I also found the monster design to be quite unimaginative; they mostly look like giant bugs with the occasional robot parts attached to them.However, the prerendered backgrounds is where the game still shines. The complete carnage of abandoned buildings, piled-up car wrecks, the subtle light effects; they all make the desolation of Gorky come alive. It really looks like something diabolical hit this town hard and now lurks in the shadows, preying on you.The battles, as said, are rather repetitive, yet oddly fun and rewarding. It’s all pretty straight forward: walk, attack, defend, heal, exploit weakness, kill stuff with fire… Every now and then there is a boss battle or an extra objective such as preventing a friendly NPC from dying. Because of rather arbitrary restrictions to the use of weapons (for example: guns can only fire in four directions, shotguns in eight) it sometimes feels as if you’re playing a weaponized version of chess (i.e.: not being able to hit someone standing right freaking next to you…).Your characters can level up their stats, but since there are no random encounters and you cannot sell or buy items, the appeal was lost to me. The battles you fight are often tough and resources are sparse, but many players have commented on the fact that the game is actually quite easy when you play it again.One minor gripe that deserves mentioning: every now and then, the plot demands that one of your party members either die or run off. When this happens, they take all their inventory with them. I was rather dismayed when I saved right after a death scene, only to later discover that I also had to say goodbye to some of my best weapons and healing items.Long story short, the game has its faults and at times I found it to be too difficult, but it was great to play this old-timer.+ Fun gameplay+ Engaging-/+ Difficulty-/+ 2D graphics good, 3D graphics bad- Repetitive music- Story lacking in depthFinal verdict:8/10."

Limited ammunition and healing items mean that your every shot matters, and just blowing everything away leaves you ill-prepared for what lies ahead of you.The story is inventive and still holds up today, as does the gameplay. The character and creature models may appear dated by today's standards, but the inventiveness and excellent sound library make this VERY easy to overlook.If you are a fan of turn-based tactics games, creepy atmoshphere, and challenging gameplay; this is a game you should seriously consider picking up.

When buying it, do expect it.As for the game itself. Back when it was released in 1999 it was definitely a hit, however it has aged rather bad. The 3D graphics are clearly outdated - low res textures, low poly models, etc. Still, the general crudeness of the game somehow appealed to me so I decided to play it and finished it afterall.Unfortunately, the gameplay itself is extremely dull. Once you get the hang of all of the game mechanics the game's only about fighting a vicious, unforgiving AI, which is rather easy to predict. Boss fights are oversimplified and often boil down to blocking/stunning the boss and hammering him/her down with every weapon available. The final boss fight is a complete joke and is probably the easiest of them all.Finally, I was greatly disappointed with the plot and depiction of characters. Once the Great Conspiracy is revealed, it turns out to be a huge load of bullocks. It doesn't even qualify for a Z grade movie. Also, two of the characters totally drove my gears - Jarek Ovitz and Slavsky. I'm of Polish descent and Ovitz is NOT a typical Polish surname, nor is Slavsky a typical Polish name. Polish people are depicted in Gorky17 as strong, yet dumb and supersticious. Also, they have Russian accents and speak very bad Polish. I know the game was probably low-budget, but that doesn't excuse a complete lack of research on Poland and Polish people.Honestly, I am super patient and that's the only reason I managed to complete the game. However, the game's not worth your time. There are other, better ones around."

You even find and use items on different objects to advance or find secrets. The voice acting is terrible too, another plus for RE fans, adding to the camp, but the translation is pretty good, actually.The battles are grid-based (you can turn the grid on and off with TAB.) The depth of the battle system relies on the multitude of weapons, and the fact that you level up weapons individually. It's best to spread the weapons around and have a team of specialists.The music is electro-industrial indicative of someone in the late '90s who had a decent synth and liked Haujobb."

The graphics and mood are both like the original Resident Evils - dark, but cheesy. The game does a good job of keeping you off balance, not knowing who to trust, or how to survive each new horror you come across. Each boss is unique, and every few battles you'll fight a new type of monster.Combat is a little weird. Weapons have distinct attack patterns - pistols can only be fired in four directions, while rifles can also be fired diagonally, etc. That restriction (and the weird camera angles) can make it difficult to make sure that you're on the right spot to be able to shoot an enemy, but you don't have to use all your movement at once, so you can adjust as needed.(I've seen videos of the original Polish version of the game where there's a visible grid in combat, but that seems to have been removed from the English version).Ammo (and healing items) are often scarce, but you also get some reusable weapons that can be used every few turns for free. Stupidly, this includes tasers that lets you stunlock some bosses (many are immune) to the point where they can't ever attack you or move.You get to choose how your characters improve when they level up, but the choices are pretty basic. Increasing health is  mostly a waste because there's nothing that can one-shot you, and healing items just heal a fixed number instead of a percentage of your health. Max out accuracy for your shooters,reducecalmness for melee guys (so that they rage out and do bonus damage easier), and then go with either luck for bonus damage or improve your counter-attack chance. (Counter attacks are free actions, but you can't switch weapons or change your facing, so plan ahead. You can face your character by clicking on him). Make sure to save after every fight or event. There are some times when you blatantly should have been given a chance to reorganize your inventory but weren't, so just reload instead.If this doesn't run properly in Windows 7, add it to the DEP list, use Windows 95/98 compatiblity mode, and use software rendering.This game is very old and rough around the edges, but it often goes on sale for a dollar and it's easily worth that."

I'll give that a try later this week.To start off, Gorky 17 looks like it has a decent premise behind it, the beginning is interesting and I was immediately sucked in the conflict at hand. The game is a turn based tactical rpg that feels similar to the original Fallout games. During my brief playtime I battled a fair amount, and I really had no idea what I was doing. There wasn't much of anything to help you learn how to battle or even how to equip your characters. I eventually figured it out but the lack of a tutorial is understandable with an older game, and I'm not going to fault it too much for it.However, that's not why I don't reccommend Gorky 17. Gorky 17, as you may find out, is quite old. very old in fact. If you have anything near a modern pc you might not even be able to play it. The game has color and texture issues, with some textures moving over your character and enemies. This makes combat very difficult, because you can't see where to move and shoot. Oh and by the way, all of these graphical issues can barely be fixed by compatability modes. The first time I launched the game it looked like I was on acid or something. My experience personally was marred by these technical issues, and while they may not be present on every user's machine, I can't reccommend this game because I didn't get a chance to play it right. I thought it looked neat and I picked it up, but with only a half hour's playtime i didn't get what I wanted out of it.This is a problem with some older games on steam, I had no real warning the game would/could essentially be unplayable due to graphical glitches. Gorky 17 probably should be taken off Steam and GoG until someone patches it (if someone cares enough.) It has a decent premise, but it will never be expanded upon unless you like can get past the graphical oddities."

Now years later, Nato sends in canadian Cole Sullivan,  polish Jerek Ovitz, and ??? Theiry Trantique to find Group 1. Well Group 1 failed their  mission pretty hard core, aka DEAD, so now you are to find out why Russia is so interested in this village '' Lubin '' and is referring to a '' Gorky 17 ''... Not a bad story huh? This kinda reminds me of the orginal Resident Evil plot set-up. Well, with old graphics but a good spooky soundtrack, hunt down Russian chaotic science hybrids in Lubin village to find out what is going on. The cinimatics are ok, with a true turn based combat system. Their also is a in enviroment items puzzle system too. As in you find items in the map that are ''keys''  to get to the next map or get items, ammo, and gear. There is 5 maps or levels, so the game is short but takes alot of searching for items the first time around. A good one for the turn based tactic lovers and those that like X-files.lol"

A serious line can sounds silly and funny.And one thing, this game is hard. At least for me.The gameplay itself is your typical grid based strategy ala X-com or even final fantasy tactics but a bit minimalistic.Battles will occur on spesific point in an area. And there is no random battles.Battlefields are flat with some obstacles. There are some object that you can interact with.Enemies have a lot of variation, each with their own behavioral pattern and strength, you'll need good strategy to effectively eliminate them.One thing that marred this game is the way they handle ammo and consumables.THERE IS NO SHOP!!The only way to heal yourself is by using consumables that can only be gained from boxes.The same thing also applied to ammo, weapons and armor.So killing everything effectively is very important lest youre running out of stuff and can't move on.Overall this game is pretty good. It's challenging and has good horror vibes. It has decent playtime about 10 hours or so and  has solid replayability value.Old maybe, but definitely worth to be played."

76561198029587500,Recommended,253920,13992395,"Posted: 15 January, 2015",all,km133688,"This is a very old game, from the 90's golden era of pc gaming.  Within its genera, it holds its end up well against many graphically superior games today.  It is a fun game and a good representation of gaming at that time.  Has some decent music too (""battle theme #2 player"" is my favorite).  But I would note the following for those contemplating buying it.1. I have windows 7 64-bit.  I had to use ""software rendering"" to get around a graphics issue.  Not all windows 7 users have to do this.  Has something to do with ffdshow maybe?  But this simple fix works fine.2. there is one place in the game where it crashes, near the end, but this area is skippable and it is a long fight with no benefits at the end.  You may not even get the fight depending upon when you visit rooms in the last area.3. recall that this was originally made for 640x480 monitors.  Scaling will be done either by your monitor or your gpu.   It is possible to turn this scaling off either via most monitors or your video card's drivers.  For example, nvidia has a ""no scaling""  and ""scale on gpu"" settings which will render an uncaled 640x480 picture.  But interstingly enough I found this little picture almost impossible to play compared to the scaled version on my 27"" screens.  So I went with the scaling.With the sale, it is a cheap 30 hours of old style gaming entertainment.  For those who think it is hard, the trick is to look for all the boxes and hidey-holes to get first aid items and ammo and special weapons, and to fight smart.  That was part of the point with these old games (smart).  By smart I mean doing things like conserving ammo, using the proper weapon type at the proper time (ranged, area of effect, mele, and the all important negative buff inflictors), and tactics like figuring out when to close in for an attack, when to make the enemy come to you, what sequence your characters should attack in, plotting ahead by two or three moves in battle, and paying attention to the immunities and special abilities of different types of monsters.  You can't just do ""combat shotgun to the head"" in this game and expect to get through it.  In the end, like most great games, it is the special abilities that make all the difference in the really hard fights.  This game offers several negative buffs you can inflict on the mutations you will be faced with, so, whatever special weapon abilities a monster is not immune to, us it on them without reservation.Good luck."

Paying attention for attacking angles, support items, damages types and constantly keeping an eye on the supplies is important.- The story is pretty good too. Don't expect extra sides of originalty, but it does it's work to keep things interesting,- Voice-over is okay.Cons- Low replayability: in every playthrough is the same, the same battles with the same monsters, everything is in the same place - basically it's a one-stop-gamer for most of the gamers.- Voice-over is okay, and talking between the characters lets you to pick up little details about then, but not it just fits in every time. The voice actors fall of the character from time to time. The conversations only occur during the cutscenes and the beginnings of the battles, and sometimes are quite inconsequential (for example in an battle with a lot of enemies, the characters are sarcastical and and ♥♥♥♥♥ure, yet in the next fight with against only two enemy the got paranoid and scared of dying. Not a big problem, but makes the image look worse.- Gameplay mechanics are sometimes inconsequental and has bugs (only one damage-over-time effect can be active, the enemy has electricity protection yet can be tranquilitized with a shocker, and theres a game crashing bug in one of the battles, so here's the solution for that:http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Gorky_17#Incubus_Boss_Crash)- For me it's a bit short. You can play through the whole game with every area explored, every enemies slain, and every item picked up under 15 hours.Overall, Gorky 17 is a fine survival TBS/point-and-click hybrid game with semi-isometric graphics in a horror-sci/fi setting. It's mixing the genres well. It has it's flaws, yes, but it makes up for it as well.And also, I warn everyone to use discretion: If the game seems a little bit outdated, old, antiquated... well, it is. This game is originally came out in 1999, as the descprition says, in an age when Pentium III/IV processors, GeForce 256 video cards,  1280x1024 monitor resolution and DVD discs were the BIG things and the WinXP was still in development.In the release year, this game was a fine product őf technology, but sadly stayed under the radar. However, up to this day this game still has a small, but sturdy fanbase, and three or four year ago there was an announcement of a sequel for this game under the name of Gorky 21. (sadly again, not much can be heard about it since then)In my opinion, if this game had the random encounter system at least, and some random-generated terrain between the key locations. it would become a classic cult game. like the original Fallout series. Well, not exactly on the same level, but close enough.All in all, I totally recommend this old, yet pretty and shiny pearl of gaming to everyone who won't turn down an old game, looks for a bit different TBS experience and likes if a game challanges them to weight and plan their every action,"

The story isn’t that bad actually but nothing memorable, its the usual ”scientific research went work and some special forces have been sent to investigate it”.Some of the advertised features are little strange, like the ”multiple-choice dialog”, there was not a single dialog where you could choose anything, I think there was totally only about 30 lines of dialog in the whole game, so that about the ”enthralling dialog”.The skills you can train are mostly useless, I think that only luck and HP were useful enough to put points in.But otherwise this is still some decent old school turn-based action game, just don’t except any RPG elements in it. Its moderately challenging, the beginning can be frustratingly hard as you don’t get too many ammo and medpaks, so you always need to think every step thoroughly, every turn counts and you can not make any mistakes.Be warned, it might not work on newer machines. I got it running on my old laptop (WIN7) but it didn’t even start on my new desktop setup (with Win7 also), always crashed on the start. Even on my laptop it still crashed sometimes in battles, it has really bad bug in the second last fight, where it would crash every time I killed the last monster in the battle, and the only way around it was skipping that battle with cheat-code.6/10"

I remember playing the demo AGES ago, but I never found a copy of the game then forgot about it.  The game's ok but has lots of flaws.  some weapons only shoot in straight lines, or straight lines and diagonals.  If you aren't standing in the right spot, you can't shoot things.  There's no cover.  Gear is limited, but mostly I like that about the game.  It makes you stingy with ammo, you melee more often.  Some weapons ""recharge"" so have unlimited shots but you can only use them every 2 or 3 turns.  Fair trade-off I suppose for unlimited ammo.   If a character dies or leaves the party in a scripted event you can't recover their gear.  It's gone.  I'd understand if they walked away, but even if they die right at your feet the stuff's gone.  it's an okay game for what it is, and for the price."

I liked the story, interesting characters popped up, and I was really engaged in finding out the answers to the questions posed throughout, but it was, for a nine-year-old, impossible. Which is exactly what I love about it as an adult. Every move of every team member in every battle counts. If you take a defensive pose with a character and aren't attacked on the enemy's turn, you'll kick yourself for not healing instead. If you end your turn facing the wrong way, an enemy might flank you for a damage bonus. If you position two characters too close, some attacks may hurt them both. All of these factors, as well as far more, can mean the difference between victory and defeat. You could very well die in the first few battles, but even then you gain valuable information about the enemy's tactics. Not for the casual turn-based fan.
