76561198144275034,Recommended,253940,12572498,"Posted: 19 October, 2014",all,infpgamer,"This JRPG style game isn't bad but it's held back by several flaws.THE GOOD : the voice acting for the main characters, especially Maya is outstanding. The spell cards are fun to combine and the graphics for the time are pretty good. The character models aren't the best but I did like the backgrounds and lighting effects. What music is there is good although there's mainly over world and battle themes. Dungeons are generally silent. Sound effects are pretty good as well and satisfying to hear. The story isn't bad either. Sometimes you have to bring a certain character to an NPC to get them to say something specific or get a key item. Think about which character might be useful with a certain NPC or on what shell.  Your battle attack/spells have 3 levels of power leading to some strategy involved. Enemies can potentially be bypassed as in games like Earthbound and Chrono Trigger and there are no random battles, enemies are on screen almost always.THE BAD: The dungeons get monotonous really fast, mainly because it's mostly about flipping switches to open doors that often lead to more switches. You're either opening doors or making new pathways and at the end you find a key item or fight a boss. Then you have to usually backtrack out of the dungeon manually which can get annoying if you just want to get out of there and don't care about exp and gold. An option to teleport out would have been helpful. There's also a lot of backtracking,  and clues to what needs to be done next can sometimes be confusing to figure out. Again, bringing the right character along on the right shell can be a big help in this aspect.Another major glaring problem for me was the slow animations during battle and the sound effects  often took even longer, still playing even when the animations were done. This is especially a problem with the zombie enemies.  I found myself using machine gun characters when I could, just because their attacks are faster.Characters take one turn at a time or combine turns during spells. You can't input commands usually until the character is done with their attack or spell/item usage unlike say a Final Fantasy game. This stuff is a bigger problem during the first half of the game, once you get a spell card that lets you attack all enemies it helps cut down on this some, but it's still a problem. I found myself running away from battles towards the end, just to get to the end of the game.Overall I enjoyed Septerra Core for the voice acting and story/setting. The battle system isn't BAD as an idea, and the card concept is neat, it's just feels slow as heck, at least for me. The switch flipping and backtracking got on my nerves fast. If the battle system was just faster, I might not have minded the rest, because that's mainly what made the dungeons more of a chore than anything else. If you're the patient type you might find the battles less grating than I did.I got it on sale here for a buck so it was worth the price. I'd give Septerra Core a 7/10. I'm going to overall recommend the game. Just be aware of the issues above if you decide to play."
,Recommended,253940,7762456,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,j0ny_brav0,"It's an old school RPG with turn-based party combat. Interesting story & setting but the ending screams for a sequel that we won't see. It has problems with modern OS (Windows 7/8) but it can be easily fixed. Combat gets tedious, Dungeon design is just ""get the key/ flip the switch and open the gate"" and backtracking to it sucks. But once you get past the cons...it's a good game in its time of release."
,Recommended,253940,9315760,"Posted: 2 March, 2014",all,Jragghen,"Septerra Core is....a difficult game to recommend. I should preface this review by saying that it is MOST CERTAINLY not for everyone. Septerra Core is an older turn-based RPG from a time where these sorts of games were common on consoles but rather rare on PC. I played the game to completion back in that era, and found it rather enjoyable - however, even then it had its rough edges, and for modern sensibilities it will be rather archaic.The combat engine is location-based, similar to how Chrono Trigger is. However, the speed/pace everything works at is exclusively suited to when you have 3 members in your party, so combat is QUITE clunky in the early portion of the game, which makes it a bit of a hurdle to overcome.The cast is varied, and the story was decent for the time (from what I recall - details are fuzzy). The concept of the WORLD itself is rather imaginative, and wholly unique from what I've run into in gaming. Aside from that, level design as the game progresses becomes....extremely maze-like. Lots of wrapping corridors which look same-y and form literal mazes.Effectively, I'm recommending this because I enjoyed this game when I played it. But anyone who purchases it should know what they're getting when they're going in - a game that was a little rough around the edges when it came out, and which probably won't appeal to most modern gamers. Only purchase if you really enjoy turn-based RPGs, or are interested in very imaginative sci-fi worlds."

The Steam version is only 1.02v though when the final patch for the game is 1.04v. You can however still patch it yourself to run the 1.04v version. The cutscenes didn't work at first but installing the version of QuickTime that comes with the game and tunring off the DirectX boxes (not the circle) in the QuickTime options has fixed this issue. (I""m running Windows 7) Other then that running the game in Windows XP SP2 compatability and I've had 0 issues since.This game is a gem for its price with minor flaws. Don't expect anymore patches though because like I stated earlier this is a Windows 95/98 era game and the only real flaw left is sometimes how fast the text plays during minor moments."

The first time was back in the day, when this game was fairly new (sooo, around 2000/2001? maybe?). 15th of May 2015 I finally finished it. Did I like it as much as I did back when I was roughly 12 years old? Well... kinda.The thing is: the game AGED ♥♥♥♥ING TERRIBLE!!!!!I don't know what my favorite feature is.Maybe the fact that everything is soooooooo slow. You're basically waiting for EVERYTHING. Wait for the fight to start. Wait until your action bar is filled up to the level you want. Wait for the enemy to finish attacking because it is their turn EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING TIME EXACTLY BEFORE YOUR ACTION BAR IS ALMOST FULL!!!! Wait for the attack animation to start! Wait for the attack animation to end! It takes ♥♥♥♥ing forever to get ♥♥♥♥ done in this game. And that's not talking about interacting with ♥♥♥♥ing objects. (Why Maya, why are you thinking so long about that order I just gave you? Pull the ♥♥♥♥ing lever!!!)Or maybe it is the TERRIBLE DUNGEON DESIGN that stretches the game about at least a third. Enter a ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE dungeon WHICH CONTAINS (apart from some items) NOTHING BUT LEVERS THAT OPEN DOORS AT THE OTHER END OF THE MAP. (Backtracking, Hooray!!!)Add to that the fact that you visit a lot of dungeons AT LEAST TWICE. Multiple times if you by chance don't have a specific item or a specific party member.That's right, most of the game is also a giant fetch quest of ""use that item nobody told you about to progress"". Get random item no.1 from place x to get random item no.2 that you might need 12 hours later at place y. Don't have item no.2 when you are IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE ♥♥♥ DUNGEON Y? WELL ♥♥♥♥ YOU, GO BACK TO X AND GET IT!!!! Thank god, that leaving one dungeon and entering a different one doesn't take ages...ohwait.I could probably continue, but I rather say that I really liked the world and the characters and back in 1999 all of these features/problems were probably not as much a pain in the ♥♥♥ as they are nowadays. The game even has some smart ideas like the 3-level-attack-bars and the spell casting system. Unfortunately, video games have moved on and kind of left Septerra Core behind. There are probably many other old games that have aged better.So, do I recommend Septerra Core. Well, obviously I ♥♥♥♥ing do because it is a really charming game that always has a special place in my heart. Also, I am now officially done with it and never have to think back like: ""Why did I never finish Septerra Core? That game was kickass back then!""In my opinion, everyone should experience the sensation that is Septerra Core in its entirety. And if you didn't back then, well, sucks to be you because nowadays the game is horrible, tedious, physical pain.But I still love you, Septerra Core. I do love you! <3<3<3<3<3"

It's one of those games that I'm glad to see being raised from obscurity since I have been wishing to be able to play again but could not find my old install discs. And fair warning, there is a debate as to if the gog version is the better one to buy due to the version patch.The game itself is a solid RPG with, for its time, a fiarly inovative combat system and quite a well done story and fairly memorable cast of characters.  The voice acting is not specacular given new gaming standards, but they are pretty good given the age of the game.  Expect to do a little bit of grinding in order to afford items and have easier times with later fights. There are serval cut points in the game where you can no longer go back to old areas after you reach them due to story progression so I'd recomend saving often and saving in multiple slots in order to be able to back up to points."

Gripping story, plenty of charm and character development, addictive and best of all a very decent combat system that is not too overwhelming but still leaves a lot of opportunities to explore, combine and exploit.On the cons side, I need to warn you it's damn hard, you will be doing a lot of backtracking (the only really annoying parts are when you are missing an item and you won't find out until you hit a brick wall - literally - and need to go all the way back to fetch the missing item, not to mention figure out where to find it). The game could have used a map/teleport system for already visited places. No biggy though, just look up online when you get stuck what next, and continue enjoying the game.Thoroughly recommending this gem in the rough."

With a wide array of characters to include in your party and distinct dialogue options for each one, there is a lot of opportunity to learn more about the world and hear the perspectives of your party members. Some parts can be challenging if you aren't sure where to go or how to find a quest item you need but exploration is rewarded. I can highly recommend this one!"

Great characters and even decent voice acting give this game it's unique charm. The battle system is good enough, if a little slow, to allow for some interesting gameplay. The main draw, however, is the world of the game, which encompasses seven different, attached worlds (I have only been to two so far, but from what I've seen, the other five should be just as interesting).Overall, the game is easy enough to get into without feeling like a walk in the park. Battles are not truly random, which is nice, and can be avoided if desired. Also, this game features a strong female protagonist, which is fairly rare even today, as well as a dog-like robot! So pick it up and enjoy the ride."

Even at less than a buck.If you did buy this nightmare of a PC game. Here are some tips to get the POS working.1. Septerra.ini contains all the keyboard settings, now you can configure it how you like. RunSelect is to run away from battle.2. In the Septerra.ini under options add ScaleMode = 0 and CpuIdle = 53. Get this patch fromhttp://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/3624/305754. Uninstall QuickTime and use the QuickTime installer withiin the Septerra folder.5. Set the new Septerra.exe from step 3 to compatibility mode for Win XP SP36. Do not use Timeslips unofficial patch, it converts the .db movies into white screens with audio.By following these steps you won't need to do the following fixes:1. Resolution color depth changes from 32 bt to 16 bit.2. Disabling any graphical settings through properites of the .exe3. No need to try and configure to run in a window to enjoy its graphics.The game will keep its aspect ratio and play in full screen.

It's a planet consisting of layers, which encircle one another as well as the Core, and descending and ascending between these planetary continents forms the basis of the overworld exploration.As an older game, there's very limited options to configure, but this surprisingly doesn't hinder it that much as it's mouse-driven with pre-rendered backgrounds. There's a number of glitches you'll likely encounter, so I'd make sure to check the Internet for solutions to common problems encountered with modern versions of Windows. If you can get over these hitches, you'll find an engaging setting with likeable characters and turn-based combat reminiscent of the SNES / Playstation era.I truly hope that the sales of this title encourage them to update it, or maybe, one can hope, remake it in HD, because it's something that everyone who's a fan of RPGs can enjoy, and that more people should experience."

Septerra Core is an Japanese styled RPG like Final Fantasy with its own charm. It was created by Valkyrie Studios and published by Monolith Productions. Later on It was Topware Interactive. Sadly Valkyrie Studios was bankcrup just a few month after Septerra Core was released. The game was sold bad as there was almost no advertisement for it. They also worked on a new game called Seraphin which was never released.Now in year 2014 the game was rereleased on steam with no fixes and no patch for anything. Sadly the publisher didnt do anything to fix that. There many good sites to find tutorials and patches on google. You will find that :)The game itself,it gives you about 100 hours of playtime to finish this game as there many eastereggs and things to find. The most negative reviews are because the game is not very compatible to new Windows versions. It was designd for Windows 95,98 and XP. There patches which makes the game run great on Windows 7. As the Video format was for Quicktime there many problems to get it running under Windows 7 + as Microsoft removed Nativ Direct Draw support. There ways to get the video sequences running which you can google.

Gameplay-wise, you know little of what to do unless some characters explicitly specify you where to go, but fortunately the areas aren't as extensive and misleading as FF's are, so catching up to where you left at will be relatively easy.Combat goes as follows: you can have up to 3 characters at any one time following you, each with different stats, play-style, and skills. When you're in combat, there is a bar under each of your characters that fills up as time goes on, with 2 3-digits numbers that represent your HP. The bar is divided into 3 parts; simply put, if you let it fill in one part, you can only use the basic weapons/moves which deals less damage, but if you let it fill up entirely, you can use more damaging moves (and the same goes for using cards, this game's equivalent of magic). You click on a character's frame when at least one bar is filled up, select the move you want to use (or use items, or invoke card powers), and target the enemy. There is a big bar of blue on top of the combat interface; that's your core energy, or what you'd call Mana, MP, SP, or whatever. NOTHING in combat regenerates, even post-battle (unless you manually use items or rest to recover those combat stats), so keep in mind when you do anything mid battle. The game is generous enough to tell you that when you use a certain move or card, the energy bar shows how much energy that move/card is going to use up, so you can plan your moves carefully. Overall, the combat feels balanced; challenging if you rush through the game with zero grinding, and rewarding if you decide to grind in one area.However, the game does not tell you what any of your character's stats do, so you pretty much have to experiment with each, or deduce yourself what each does. Also, despite the game telling you where to go next explicitly through well-voiced NPC dialogues, it does not tell you what to do when you're in said location.The plot is quite linear, with little, but appreciable amount of side-missions. The lore is, personally, rather extensive for a game that has no sequel. You go from place A to place B, go to C, then back to A for some quick stuffs, and move on to D.Laziness overtook me. I'll just say that if you're someone who enjoys FF or JRPG in general, puzzles, and exploring, this game is worth the price.P.S. get the official patch for this game, otherwise it's unplayable for Windows 7 and above. I wouldn't recommend installing the unofficial patch because it made the game run on like, 2 or 3 fps."

Nowadays i cant stomach jrpg style round based combat anymore but to my surprise sunk quite some hours into this already because it puts a good spin on the formula.Theres the typical ATB system but its kinda like charging up instead of waiting for the bar to fully fill to being able to do something. Theres 3 levels - If you just wanna pop a potion or do a quick weak attack you can do that at the first level which is full usually in like 3 seconds. Second level delivers more oomph and third level delivers major oomph (double and triple with damage bonus else what would be the point of waiting) and all levels also have special attacks available. At the start when theres not many options its still unfortunately a snorefest but when you get more dudes with differing attack strength and charge speed it gets interesting, moreso since its all realtime (it stops when you click your dudes to select actions tho).Also no random battles, you can see all enemies on the map.Graphic style and character design is interesting/weird, like FF7 and Baldurs Gate mashed together - i guess western rpgs needed more anime hair. Simple and sensible story by comparision. Some tedium like multiple treks thru the same frikking cave but thats the nature of the beast prolly.Surpassed my expectations by a long shot."

It offered great 2D graphics, that look good to this day, very unique world with it's own mythology and many playable NPC characters that were both very unique and likable.I personally put this game higher than any Final Fantsy game that I played, with the exception of FF8 (yep, not FF7 fan) - I'd put it on par.The story is very solid, gameplay is similiar to FF games, it even has summons, but magic system is not copied thankfully, but instead uses mana pool and cards, that (up to 3) characters can combine, to create different effects.If you don't mind anime art style and science fiction setting, I highly recommend this game.I have the originl CD and GoG versions.

Very similar turn based battles with combination attacks. Just like in CT, there's a robot character, girl engineer character, etc. But crappy plot/dialogue and insane amount of mind numbing, time consuming backtracking. I attempted to play this game several times, wasted tens of hours, never finished it, deleted after one or another boring fetch quest. And plot.. I can't remember much after all these years, but it involved some evil dude hunting for some macguffin and several characters dying while trying to give my character time to escape. Yes, this dumb cliche scene occured 2 or 3 times through the game.Pre-rendered 2D graphics in 640x480 sure looked nice in 90s, but were already dated at the time of release. Its main competitor, Anachronox, also a CT-inspired western JRPG, looks much better on modern PCs, in addition to simply being better written and more fun. Also suffers from backtracking, but has ""secret"" fast-forward button to make it bearable.And this game.. I would not call it bad, but it isn't Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Xenogears, Fallout, Baldurs Gate, Planescape Torment, Dark Sun, etc. etc. So many great games, so little time.

The game does give you precisely zero direction on where your objectives actually are. Second, combat is a CHORE. I find myself dumping as many bonuses as I can into my speed stats just so I can get through it quicker. To be clear, an attack is carried out usually by a combatant jumping toward their attack target, performing their attack animation, then jumping back into their position. This whole time, the entire ATB system stops so you can watch. Combat is structured much like Final Fantasy 13's combat, except far less fluid. You get three action bars, but only one action a turn, and any action you take drains your entire ATB meter. I learned this the hard way. The one thing it does have going for it is that its story is keeping me interested (I do enjoy a good story well told), but combat is going to have to start getting much quicker.------This game is fine but not perfect. I picked it up on sale for a whopping 75 cents and at that price, sure, worth every penny. But then, so are most games.I've been playing it for a little while, but it gives you no instruction on how to play it at all. Opening cutscenes finish and you're just standing there like a dunce.The game is controlled by click-and-holding where you want to go (you can use arrow keys, but...just use the mouse), and your first objective is to get to class.This is me, right now, on that first objective:http://youtu.be/7hR34OGe30I?t=2m14sAt 75 cents, it's a steal.

To my understanding, it's a pretty old game so it is possible to be understanding towards it. However, many parts of this game are simply too frustrating and confusing to make it enjoyable. It only has nostalgia value for those who have played it before. If this game ever gets a remake and its problems are fixed, then I might give it a try again.+ Fairly interesting characters+ Battle music is pretty neat+ Funny robots+/- Story; Nothing really worth mentioning.- HORRID combat pace; You have to watch the characters jump through air, hit the target and then jump back. Half the combat is watching is horrendously long animation. I like the main heroine because she just shoots the enemies.- Very bleak; There's no colour anywhere. Every world is just depressing and gloom. It makes you think you're looking at a post-apocalyptic world when in reality it's not.- Pretty quiet; The game doesn't play music often enough.- Confusing story-telling; The story skips many parts that are required for us to form a complete picture of the story. Having cutscenes would help but they're not there.- Frustrating puzzles; True to the games of old, many of the puzzles are VERY obscure. I needed a walkthrough on many occasions to make any sense of what must be done.If you still insist on giving this game a try, wait until it's on sale."

That's because it sucks. The main character is unlikable and unappealing. Actually, no character is likable in this game other than the robot dog Runner. Also, I find a lot of things very cheesy in the game, one example being Led's father's bad decision. What you expect to happen is him listening to his daughter. When he refuses and leaves, he also puts men on the bridge to stop anyone from coming, including his daughter. I laughed when I saw this fight; a general is ready to nuke an entire continent to protect his daughter from harm and he'll stop at nothing, he'll even let his men throw grenades at her if she tries to stop him.What a joke.

The reviews out there are right.  The battles, which is a HUGE chunk of any JRPG-style game, needs to be solid.  The biggest problem is that it's so slow.  Painfully slow to the point you will start to dread each encounter.  In short, you have to wait, and wait for your attack gauge to fill up for a more powerful attack.  Meanwhile, you're being hit repeatedly by the enemy, in very slow and poor animations.  When you attack, you miss often, and also have a slow and poor animation.  By the time I had fought a dozen battles, I didn't want to deal with them anymore.I could go on about some of the redeeming qualities I noticed, such as the solid music, some witty dialogue, and the overall premise of the game, but it's all completely crippled by the battle system.  You might want to see what happens next, but I struggled to push through the awful fighting and get there.To note, I'm 30 yrs old and have been playing RPG's since the original Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy.

Well, to be quite honest I wasn't so thrilled with it so I've put it aside and didn't touched it again, that until Steam reminded me of its existence. After all those years I just felt like giving it another shot (especially because the price was alright). To be quite honest, it wasn't such a bad experience... Well, actually it doesn't offer much replay value, because there're some really tedious mazes and a whole lot of grinding, so I just feel like taking an instant nap when I think of it. Besides that, if you don't have a FAQ to provide you some support during your run, things can get even more annoying. The story isn't bad, the characters are somewhat generic, the gameplay is ok, the soundtrack is fine too, but nothing memorable anyway. I won't say anything about the graphics because after all, we're talking about an outdated game.

At times it almost rushes the plot, at others you are watching paint dry.  Similar feel of other nostalgic games, Final Fantasy, Chrono trigger, ect.Battles 3.5 of 5- Unique style, but limited customization probably due to the age of the game.  Only thing I didn't like was that battles took so freakishingly long to do, character animations included it made battles way too long.Characters 4 of 5- Good job with what they had to work with back then.  You definately find your favorites pretty quick.As far as all these comments mentioning glitches? I haven't run into a single one, back in the day these games took something called 'patience'  for things to load up and looks like people are taking them as glitches.  Sometimes your character won't walk to where you click it... probably because where you clicked isn't ""movable space to walk on"".  This is normal and it might make your character walk in the opposite direction.  Not a glitch.Also, if you are expecting the game to spoonfeed what to do next, forget it.  This is when games took thought, no fight tutorial, and no hints on what to do next.  It's all on brains and sheer stubborness to beat the game.Overall: would buy again"

The voice recordings are not particularly good, either.  Conversation with NPCs and party members is done by static head images with dialogue windows.  Battle is turn-based with a timer for each player; a level 2 action means a longer wait than a level 1 action.

,Recommended,253940,35066564,Posted: 19 September,all,Tsurayu,"Having played this game many years ago, not long after it first came out, I can't deny that nostalgia might be a heavy influence on my perception of this game.That said, Septerra Core is enjoyable. The story, while not a unique experience, does it's job to motivate the characters and the world around you to action. Big bad scary guy who thinks he is the savior of the world, actually seeks to destroy it and rebuild it in his own divine image, yadda, yadda. Point is, if you've played a few RPGs, you've ran through this story before.What is unique, perhaps for better or for worse depending on your tastes, is the gameplay. It's a derivative of the ATB system found in a lot of earlier JRPGs. The pacing is admittedly very slow. Don't expect most battles, regardless of your level or equipment to take any less than a minute to complete. While the game wants to appear to appear and play like a JRPG (mind you this is an entirely American CRPG) its Western side shines through in it's difficulty. The game is punishing, and never really relents. You can grind, and grind, and grind. But at the end of the day, your wits will have to be about you. Sure, you can cheese a lot of encounters with FATE cards (think games magic system) but you are limited in how many times you can use them before restoring your Core (think a shared MP pool between party members).Presentation is what you would come to expect from a lot of Western RPGs of the late 90s. Developers really seemed to love their FMVs, which I should note as of the most recent patch, should play without any need for you to mess with the dreaded Quicktime. The music is definitely one of the weakpoints. I wouldn't say it's terrible, or will make your ears bleed. However, there isn't a single song, tune or sound effect that will be memerable, and perhaps more than a few that might actually annoy you (particularly with some commonly reused sound effects).The real highlight for the game, at least in my eyes, is the attention the developers game to making this Western RPG feel  and play similarly to a JRPG. Remember that in the late 90s JRPGs still weren't really ""clicking"" overseas. Sure, the Final Fantasy games had started to become a bit of a household name at this time thanks to FFVII, but there were still a lot of WRPG players that weren't willing to adapt to the more thematic style of their Japanese counterparts. This game, while certianly not the only title, went a lot way to helping to bridge that gap. While Septerra Core might end up as more of a historical footnote in that regard, it is an overall fun and challenging RPG whose deficits are outweighed by it's uniqueness."
