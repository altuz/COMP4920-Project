,Not Recommended,253960,16282021,"Posted: 9 June, 2015",all,Lin,"I have a rather high tolerance threshold when it comes to adventure games, especially old ones. Campiness and minor technical flaws are often part of the package, and I'm okay with that. So I was fine with realizing that the intro gave me a game breaking bug (on Win 8.1 64x) that there are no known solutions for: I watched the intro on youtube, then skipped it when launching the game, and thought little of it. The terrible (not an exaggeration) voice acting didn't deter me and neither did the really bad translation into english. Especially not since the art was decent, the animation fine enough for its age, the smooth jazz score impressively good (way WAY above the call of duty), and the start to the story a promising noir gumshoe's-tale-of-woe, the kind you probably can appreciate if this game peaked your interest.And then I realized how bad the controls were. And while that too is very often to be expected, these specific controls really go out of their way to make your life miserable. (They're also nowhere explained, read the manual before playing.) It would be much easier to forgive that if the game didn't saddle you with a huge amount of seemingly useless items (stuffed into an inventory system only reachable through F1) that you have to individually pick out every time before you attempt to try them onto yet another tiny, unreachable hotspot for some unfathomable reason. I cannot explain how soulcrashingly clunky the system is, especially when you may have to repeat it 20 times in a row on a single hotspot and still not get a result.I didn't hate the story, at least so far in. Not that it was good, but it was bad and campy in an interesting way. ;) But the gameplay is just really really bad. The controls and horrible puzzle design finally got the best of me.The term ""illogical puzzle"" that we throw about so often in adventure games? If you haven't played this game, you have no idea what that term means. Combine that with the insane amount of unusable items, the big maps, the complete lack of clues or guidance and those punishing controls, and you have a real recipe for frustration.If you are still willing to play this game, do as everyone tells you and play it with a walkthrough. And yes, I realize how odd that sounds, but trust me (and everyone else) that's the only way to play the game without dropping it halfway through like I did. Alternatively you could just watch a Let's Play, and enjoy all the campiness and fascinating flaws of this odd bit of gaming history without suffering any of the frustrations yourself. At least that's what I'm doing. ;)"

The story is incoherent, the controls and the navigation through the city are clunky and the voice acting is mechanic at best. It also doesn't help that there's a lot of scenery in the game that isn't used at all and the random catacombs and libraries were just bizarre in a 1930s noir setting.Get it in a bundle and play it with a guide if you really want to, you'll just end up dead or with a broken save otherwise."
,Recommended,253960,12016053,"Posted: 7 September, 2014",all,General Kass,"For completing my Papers, Please card set, I got a 75% discount on this game. I've been playing LA Noire and like adventure games, so I figured why not if its only $1.25.The first line of dialouge sets the tone for the entire game. The voice acting is the perfect amount of hilariously bad. The inflections, tone, and delivery are universally bad and I had a smile the whole time I was playing. Everything that any person says or does is hilarious. In the opening, Jack is given a Colt pistol by the Mayor and just waves it around. Its so hilariously bad, you can't help but smile.Impressivley, the entire game is done in hand drawn animation and it shows, usually in a good way. Although very early on, someone gets shot and the artist just drew a hole in the victims suit. No blood, no wincing or leaning over, the suit had a hole in it and the victim fell over. Additionally, the game calls itself a ""Cinematic Experience"", but between the art style, the way talking heads pop up in a box, and how any action is done in a seperate bubble (leaving the main scence as static characters who are only capable of moving their feet unless specifically in an animation), the game feels more like an interactive comic book.You have some choice of what your character says, but they seem to lead to the same result or they are not representive of what you want to say. Early on (I don't feel this is a spoiler since its in the game's description) you're read your rights by a cop and they want you to say something. There is no ""Remain Silent"" option, all you can do is act like a smartass at all times. This is even worse when Jack visits his next door neighbor who tries to set him up on a date and his only response is to be a  total jackass to her. Its so hilariously bad, you really have to see it for yourself.Something that is instantly a problem is lack of direction. The very first time I was granted use of the mouse, I had to look up what to do, because I had clicked on everything and was totally stuck. Turns out, you need to right click to select an action: Observe, touch, punch, or talk. Later, I picked up a feather duster and Jack's neighbor said ""I need a new feather duster"", but I couldn't figure out how to open my inventory, turns out you press F1. None of this was told to me prior to starting the game. There is no tutorial, you're just dropped in the world and that's it. I understand that this is a game from the late 90's and was rereleased in early 2000's, but when compared to modern adventure games, it falls short because of how little slack it gives to the player.I recommend this, only because of how hilarious the first five minutes are. As I continue to play, I hope it maintains that standard of terrible."
,Not Recommended,253960,8902257,"Posted: 29 January, 2014",all,Soliloqui,"Hm, I love classic point and click adventure games but after about 15 minutes of this one I'm feeling quite nauseated by it.The controls are fiddly and annoying and you often have to do things several times before they register and you can progress. However I've played a good many of these kinds of games and I've dealt with worse for the sake of a fantastic storyline, so that in itself is not a deal-breaker for me.The voice acting is terrible, there is no flow to dialogue and it sounds like each line was recorded separately with actors who've never seen the script and who do not understand the syntax of English.The lead character is fundamentally oboxious and unpleasant. That's probably the point, and maybe they are planning on doing some amazing character building and turning it around, we shall see.My real problem with it so far is the rampant sexism. I know they're trying to invoke the spirit of the 1930s but they're really massively overdoing it on the gender stereotypes. I'm literally on the 2nd scene of the game and have heard at least four negative statements about women. As if the world of gaming really needed any more kitchen jokes! I'd understand an undertone of it to set the scene of the game, but at the moment it just feels like being bashed over the head with the blunt, narrow-minded opinions of someone who doesn't usually get an outlet for them. Have a little subtlety and empathy for your burgeoning female fan-base before you alienate them entirely.I plan on finishing the game and altering this review accordingly once completed, but as it stands at present I'm proceeding with extreme caution and not particularly high hopes that I'm not totally wasting my time."

It'd be great to see someone do a good modern adventure set in the 30's but this is really poor.Get ready for unskippable scenes, random re-starts and some awful looking gameplay.

Not counting volume sliders, the only thing you can do with any effect at all is to reverse stereo which, obviously, makes the left side dialogues audible but the right side mute. DC version of Jack Orlandodoesn't have a correct stereo support. So after you turn on captions and suffer an uneven ear-stimulation experience thinking it's over and you can finally enjoy what's left of this long time ago fairly decent point&click, a notification comes up. Any notification. It's enough to get an instant message or change the volume, if that's what triggers OSD on your system. The game will curl up in the lower left corner of your screen leaving you only one tiny icon to click on in order to make it full screen again. It won't switch your resolution back, though, so good luck finding anything.WorkaroundsGo into the game's directory, loadwineprefix, runwinecfgand set it to use mono output. Disable notifications when playing. Entirely. Also prepare a terminal window withxrandr -s 0ready to run after you finish playing.

,Not Recommended,253960,12299395,"Posted: 30 September, 2014",all,Starit,"The plot is pretty shallow and poorly executed, most of the characters have nothing interesting to say, and the voice acting is laughable.The game has places where you can die without warning, and dead ends: maybe you forgot to pick up an item in another place, now the game is impossible to complete. Or maybe you gave an item to the wrong character, and lost it forever. I hope you have a saved game before that, otherwise, time to start the game all over! You have to play it with a walkthrough open, which defeats the purpose of a point and click adventure game.If you're wondering what's the director's cut content, it seems like they had a bunch of a backgrounds from a different game they didn't finish and they just shoehorned them into the game. They make absolotely no sense, because they're like, medieval catacombs and fantasy dungeons, and they have nothing to do with the plot of the game. It's terrible.The music and the art are the only good thing about this title.

,Not Recommended,253960,13456466,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,talgaby,"Short version: 51%Jack Orlando is a hopeful, but in the end very disappointing late 90s point ‘n’ click adventure with a flat story, flat characters, and almost hilariously ill-designed puzzles. Although the wonderful graphics and music help to set a tone, the bad voice acting and the gradually weakening plot quickly ruins the game beyond any hope of salvation.Long version:Toontraxx– a developer known mostly for cheap arcade games– made Jack Orlando in a time when point ‘n’ click adventures enjoyed their last real large wave of success. At first it seems they did a decent job; even with the awful voice acting, the highly detailed hand-drawn graphics and the smooth jazz set a good atmosphere for this early 1930s hard-boiled detective story.Yet there is a reason why nobody remembers it now. Because it just wastes your time: entire scenes, conversations, and a large number of items serve absolutely no purpose. Most of the play time is spent by pure guesswork on what random item do you need to give to a random person. Plot-critical people/items appear out of thin air only after a certain utterly unrelated task was completed. And on top of all you can get permanently stuck– a clear indication of bad game design.With these kinds of mistakes only a die-hard adventure game fan could enjoy anything about Jack Orlando. But even they should use a walkthrough, because without it the game is just pure suffering."

,Not Recommended,253960,23602957,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,Mellow_Online1,"IntroductionIt's come to this. After the 54 reviews I've done I've found good games *cough* Skyrim *cough* and I've found bad games *cough* *cough* Day One: Garry's Incident *cough**cough* But out of all of the bad games that I've reviewed I've never had a game leave this sort of bad taste in my mouth like Jack Orlando did. I'm not saying that Jack Orlando is one of the worst games of all time (That spot is still held by day one) but I felt betrayed. I felt all of my childhood crumble down and fall apart right in front of me and I felt that Jack Orlando was the bomb that fell on the genre that I grew up with. I would also like for everyone to take note that Jack Orlando and another point and click adventure game that I reviewed called ""The mystery of the Druids"" were released around the same time and I think it was these games that killed the point and click genre. At least with mystery of the druids I enjoyed it because it was so bad it was good. Jack Orlando has barely anything good in it. Everything from the dialogue, the sometimes unresponsive point and clicking or the characters, nearly everything is wrong.PlotThe plot is that it's set in 1933 and you play as detective Jack Orlando, who used to be a worldwide famous detective, capturing crooks and saving lives and even being awarded a gun by the mayor. However Jack's fame has worn and he barely has anything left. However one night in an alley near Jack's place, Jack passes by the alley and witnesses a murder and Jack is then knocked out. Police find him the next morning and believe he murdered the victim who's revealed to be Major Pete Reynolds of the US army. Jack is then given 48 hours to clear his name and thus is the plot of the game. There isn't really anything necessarily wrong with the plot except that it's quite a cliche plot. Someone's given a limited amount of time to clear their name for a crime they didn't commit, it's been done to death by both video games and movies. Another thing I have to talk about is the pacing of Jack Orlando. What I'm about to say will probably make absolutely no sense. The pacing is confusing. Now if any of u have played at least one point and click game you will know that the basic thing is to do logical things in order to unlock certain areas, conversation topics or items in order to advance. Jack Orlando does that but not well. Another thing that should be basic to point and click games is to lock off dialogue that may spoil later parts of the game. Jack Orlando's locking system must have gotten mixed up somehow. It locks off the things that don't need to be locked off and unlocks the things that should be locked. The developers think that they should lock a bar away which the only reason that bar exists is for one thing, pick up a vase next to the piano and to unlock the bar, you need to give a packet of cigarettes to a bellboy which the game never even hints towards. However the developers decide to not lock away a certain piece of dialogue about a casino from the beginning of the game whereas Jack isn't supposed to have this dialogue until near the end of the second act.Art styleThe art style I have mixed opinions about. This whole game was hand drawn and the backgrounds look really good. They match that sort of noire detective feel that the rest of the game should have done. The character designs are another story. They sort of look like what would happen if u tried to watch an overweight, middle aged man try and fit into a size 2 shirt. They look uncomfortable and they look like they've been rammed into the setting.Voice actingThe voice acting is for the most part bad as well. Jack sounds like he was drunk half the time he was on set to record his line. Elisabeth sounds like she was voiced by a 7 year old that was pretending to be in her early 20s. The voice actor for Don Scaletti sounds like he's trying way too hard to put on an Italian accent and failing every time he does it. The list goes on.CharactersIf any of you have read either my Harvester review (which I got quite a bit of backlash on) or my mystery of the druids review (on steam), you should know that characters for me tend to be the con of point of click games and I say none stood out. But the thing is with Jack Orlando is that they all stood out just because of how bad the writing for them were and how bad and clumsily the voice actors said their lines. Interpret that information however you want.PuzzlesAlso, Jack Orlando's puzzles are just plain confusing and make no sense. In my Harvester review I said that puzzles in Harvester were ""more like petty crimes done by the village idiot."" In my mystery of the druids review I said ""The puzzles seem straight forward at first but the solution for most of them is extremely ludicrous"" With Jack Orlando there are things which shouldn't even have to be puzzles but are and every single puzzle are stretched out and are made way too difficult than they have to be. At the start you need to find your keys to your apartment and Jack, being the typical adventure game hero, never has anything on him the player doesn't tell him to carry. So where is the key? Under the rug at the entrance to the apartment. You might as well have had Jack carrying the key instead of making me put in that extra 5 seconds of gameplay to look under a rug and find the key. There are also tons of items that you can pick up that serve no purpose to the game. I can see that maybe they were trying to make it more difficult to break the usual adventure game trend to trick u that everything has a use but in this one it doesn't but Jack Orlando doesn't do this well.SoundtrackThe one thing that this game seems to do right and better than any other adventure game is the music. The music is fantastic. It is that perfect music you could imagine being in an old noire detective video game. Type in youtube jack orlando soundtrack and listen to it.Final verdictJack Orlando is a badly put together, unfinished point and click adventure game where puzzles are thrown at the player with no rhyme or reason.Pros:+ Good backgrounds+ Characters stand out+ Amazing musicCons:- Cliche plot- Dialogue that should be locked isn't- Characters are badly drawn- Bad voice acting- Confusing puzzles- Unnecessary puzzles- Items that are unnecessaryThis is one of the worst point and click games I've ever playedMy Steam curator page:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews"

One night after drinking his sorrows away, Jack unwittingly stumbles onto the scene of a murder - and the blame is immediately placed on him due to the lack of witnesses and evidence. He's given two days to find the real killer; thus, he soon finds himself tangled in an elaborate conspiracy.Sounds like a pretty decent noir-themed story, doesn't it?Well, it could be, if it wasn't so campy - but that's not necessarily a bad thing, in my own opinion.**I'm an optimist, so I'll write about the pros, next:-Good art style: There was a lot of polished buildings and furniture, they all gave off a very classy art deco style. The 'interactive' objects such as characters and vehicles, on the other hand, were a bit more...Toony, they were definitely set apart from the backgrounds; but I don't mind, I thought the game was very charming in these aspects.-Music: By far, the music won me over and I'd say if you weren't going to play the game, you might at least try listening to the soundtrack (there are clips all over Youtube). Despite the game being set during the 1930s, the soundtrack had more of an 80s buddy-cop theme. It didn't feel very natural, but it was fun to listen to (lots of saxophone).-Exploration: I enjoyed looking at all the backgrounds, trying to piece together the history behind them. For instance, there's this one green, abandoned building that's across from The Cotton Club, and it appears to be some kind of abbey from the renaissance era and it evolves into more modern settings as you move upwards.The game does have a nice atmosphere and the whole point of Point & Clicks is to take the time to really appreciate the setting without the stress of rushing.**Now for cons:-Voice acting: I have mixed feelings about this aspect. The accents were very thick and some of the actors' emotions didn't match up with the dialogue. And, sometimes, Jack's voice replaced some of the NPCs, and it was pretty entertaining. I didn't expect much, since this game came out in the late 90s and it was developed by a very small crew in Poland.-Gameplay: The gameplay, sadly, isn't all that great.There's a lot of stuff to pick up in the game, probably more than half of it is stuff I never needed (I did some reading and realized that these were called 'Red Herring Objects'; purely for the fun of finding and collecting them).Not only that, but the game can be very unforgiving at certain parts - you MUST save frequently and make different save slots because there are some points where if you say or do the wrong thing, or aren't quick enough to avoid a dangerous situation - it's an instant kill/defeat, and it's a game over. (I loved the atmosphere and music for The Harbor, but that was by far the most difficult and frustrating part of the game; and it's a shame because noir and gum-shoes and risky business at the docks should be the perfect combination!)And, yes, the controls are a bit wonky (Tip: F1 is inventory, F4 is menu options, and Right Click is the various action icons to use with the environment), so you might want to get a feel for them and write them down for reference.-Story & Characters: This is also a mix for me.I'll tell you right now that if you choose to play the game - don't take it too seriously.It's so cheesy, campy, and light-hearted it almost can't be considered a noir story (Horseshoe in a boxing glove, etc.).The story is very short and even more simple; and the characters don't have much background, nor psychological traits to speak of. (That was disappointing because I would've like to have known why Jack turned to drinking, was there some trauma involved? A case gone bad in the past?)I personally liked Jack, he was a bit more relatable and believable than the other characters, they felt so transparent.Overall...This was an okay game to sit down and relax with, it's not great, and I doubt I'd replay it all over again; but I would replay the beginning, at least, because the early investigation and the night life in the city was fun.Many people have complained of issues about the game failing to launch, and this happened to me as well.Oddly, after the latest update, my game suddenly ran fine and I was able to pick up where I left off and finish it.If you're unsure of whether you'd like to buy it, just know that the Steam version will always be the cheapest due to the coupons - although there's a download for it on Amazon for the same price, but I don't know if one will work better than the other; I just got lucky with my copy.If not, you might enjoy watching a walkthrough of it; I personally recommend 123Pazu's guide because they're very thorough and there's no commentary.Would I recommend it?Maybe, but cautiously (I wish there was a 'mixed' or 'conflicted' button option for reviews)."

I hope all get to experience such a piece of work, and that the course of their lives will be forever changed, as mine has.5/5 hot peppers"

This game is so bad, it goes around, whizzes past good and goes right back to bad.  The voice acting is awful (but funny--there was one point where Jack is talking to a girl and she shuts him down IN JACK'S OWN VOICE), the music is a selection of three 16-bar light jazz patterns, there is little to no indication of what you're supposed to be doing at any given time.If I'd spent the full five dollars instead of seventy cents on a weekly sale, I'd be talking♥♥♥♥♥♥ but what do you expect for less than the price of a soda?"

You can get permanently stuck, having to reload an old save or restart the whole game. I honesty believed this incredibly bad game design died in the early 90's."

If you like adventure games, give this one a go (especially if you can get it cheap)... otherwise, skip it. The only redeeming feature is the jazz soundtrack.This has some of the worst voice acting I've ever heard. Even straight up text would've been better."

Really cool hand-drawn sceneries and pretty good story.Soory to dissapoint but guess only Polish people will have good memory and fun with it. Since voice actors are better for us. I Guess jokes and few stupid things only we will tolerate. Still give it a go it's pretty cheap classic after all ;p"

It wasn't worth it. I just found after playing a bit I didn't care about it enough to keep playing, so just got the cards and uninstalled it.The game is a bit poor, the voice acting can be terrible and the graphics can be good in some parts but become almost amateurish in another parts.The whole thing looks like was made with some effort and care but simply wasn't enough.If you want to give it a try, do it on your own risk."

I had played the game for a few hours and I discovered I had done the tasks in the wrong order so I couldn't continue.  If I had continued I would have got nowhere, luckily I checked a walkthrough.  I never bothered starting over.I only played €0.74 for this so I suppose the gameplay was OK for the price.  If you do decide to get this game wait for a sale and follow a walkthrough step by step to save you much annoyance later."

Game is already terrible enough. Police suspect you for a murder, You have 48h to prove yourself that it wasn't you and you have to find clues and solve other mysteries just to make it happen.It's cartoonish.Game has bad controls.Right click mouse button will give you some options.Pressing F1 will open the option menu and your loadout. Good thing they will tell you about it.You can lower volume and sound only in-game.The game has subtitles when talking and it is voiced over. However the voice over is really weird and terribly done.Voice/sound quality is awful.Game is sort of boring.You can increase the walking speed.Weird animations.Crashes.No help or hints. You have to figure everything and anything out on yourself.Other things.Some crashes can't be avoided.Shift tab is NOT WORKING.THIS GAME HAS AN AUTOSAVE. WHICH MEANS WHENEVER U PRESS THE NEW GAME BUTTON BY ACCIDENT. YOU WILL LOSE THE PREVIOUS SAVED GAME.-------------------I Give this game a 2/10"
,Recommended,253960,34524282,Posted: 27 August,all,Comxz2,This game is really great it takes you back to 30s the vintage days that i really wanted to be in but anyway lets back to review: this game talks about Detective called Jack Orlando he was walking around the city and heared a gun fire he went to the place that he heared a gun fire come from but someone hit him in his head and story starts from here.Pros: great soundtrack - good story - good gameplay style also useing mouse - classic days :) - have trading cards - Fun to play - Noir and i actually like Noir Games.Cons: Voice actors are crap - when you trying to save or quick save it makes me feel like i'm playing 1993 game.Buy it guys you will not waste nothing by trying this game but to be honest the gamers who love classic type of games would enjoy this but the gamers who love modern games racing - zombie - war - action - sports etc don't try to buy this game because you gonna cry and say i wanna back my money etc but after all i like this game and also its causal.
