76561198030788488,Not Recommended,253980,19721638,"Posted: 15 December, 2015",all,Cracktus Jack,"Enclaveis a fantasy action-adventure game. The rift that separated the Enclave of Magic from the Outlands is slowly closing, and heroes emerge from both sides, either to defend or conquer the Enclave.Pros: The game offers two campaigns, first the light campaign where you defend the Enclave from the invaders, and then the dark campaign where you are a minion seeking the glory of conquest. As the story progresses, you find or unlock additional equipment and up to six characters (per campaign) to play as. At the start of each chapters, you get to pick your character and equipment, limited by how much gold you found in each mission. For the most part, you can backtrack as much as you want for each missions, and replay any of them at any time if you missed out on some gold and want to try to do better (allowing you to select more equipment).Cons: I don't know why this was tagged as an RPG on Steam, 'cause it sure isn't: you have no stats, no upgrades, no character interaction or dialog choice. You don't even really purchase and manage an inventory, gold serves as ""points"" that determine how much equipment you can bring in a mission, being able to swap out at full value any item in between chapters. It is a Hack & Slash in the most basic fashion, battles consisting merely of slashing in the wind, only knowing whether you hit anything if damage numbers appear, while the AI is monstrously bad (enemies just jiggle about, only occasionally chasing assuming you don't break line of sight, like passing behind a chair). Voice acting is horrible, the story is rather poor, character progression is absent, and having up-to-date resolution doesn't save the graphics that have aged so badly that most 3D Fantasy early access indie titles are doing better than this blocky 2-Gen-Old world.Verdict: ★☆☆☆☆ - May it rot in your backlogIt's not horrible, but it is pretty bad by today's standards. I simply cannot get myself invested enough to ever play it again, leave alone complete a playthrough of even the first campaign. Maybe once upon a time it was considered a good game, but I can't see how I could recommend it to anyone, even for the low price.P.S.: At the time of my review, there were dozens of Steam Recommendations that were fake, just to raise the score. They all said ""gg"" or ""ggg"" with usernames starting by X or ending by XYZ and all had the same account picture (once my review topped the store page for a few months, the fake reviews were removed or altered to make them more subtle). Seriously, dev/fans? You sank so low that you wanted to ""cheat"" the Steam score to make more sales?—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)reviews."

,Recommended,253980,32337483,Posted: 11 June,all,Bangledeschler,"Enclave is a classic fantasy combat game. It offers various unlockable classes, challenges, unlockable gear, good/evil stories, and simple combat.The story is a typical classic fantasy story of good versus evil, you will collect gold to help build your character, and once unlocked can use any character of that alignment at your strategic disposal (you cannot switch while in a level however),  Be warned as the difficulty curve can be extreme and inconsistant.  You might fly through a level, or find yourself being punished over and over again until something happens to work, but it is not game ruining.  Once you beath the Light story, you can then move onto the dark story as a loyal minion to the mighty Mordessa and Lord Vatarr.  Though with two different alignments, you will run into very similar character types (archer = assassin for example).Recap:+Classic good/evil story+Simple enough combat+Enjoyable gameplay and diverse classes+Challenging-It can become very difficult very certain moments, as well as dependent on your class-Story can be boring to some-Mouse and Keyboard only (unless you find some way through a third party program perhaps)I still recommend this classic game and have no real bugs or technical problems to report."

I enjoyed what I played of Enclave eventhough it's clearly dated by this point, but unforunately, I decided to uninstall the game and move on because of crash troubles.Enclave plays fairly well.  The controls are straight forward and not overly complicated.  It's easy to dive into it with a minimal tutorial.I wanted to keep playing it, but the game randomly crashes too often (windows 8.1).  You have to reload and start the last mission again, the in-mission checkpoints aren't save points, just start points if you die inside that particular mission.  I found a fix that tells you how to change a line in the config file from Direct3D to OpenGL.  This fix stabilizes Enclave quite a bit so that it doesn't crash quite as often, but it still crashes.  I found that your chances of crashing increase if you die and restart the mission, or die and load at a checkpoint.Maybe someday I will revisit it and try to finish it, but due to the crash problems, I have to give Enclave a thumbs down."

You use what you need, when you need it, and it's bloody satisfying blasting a bunch of armored knights with a bomb.-No serious difficulty spikes; the game picks up the pace as you go along, not suddenly bombards you with something unreasonable you've never seen before.-Stealth works the way you'd expect.-Multiple weapon types that actually feel different and require different timings for their attacks to actually land. Each of the several staves also has a very different main and secondary attack.-Has a great cast of diverse characters for you to play as that actually have an impact on their playstyle; each of them has different equipment that they can use, different size hitboxes, different health and damage modifiers.-Locational damage is very accurate and makes aiming for the most vulnerable part of your enemy a good way of removing them. This mechanic works well with the fact different characters have different armor types for different sections of their body, depending on armor class.The cons are also easy to list:-It's too short.-Sound design. On multiple occasions I found the voice lines got sped up, raised in pitch or what-have-you.-It's duration leaves something to be desired.-Soundtrack is not that great.-It's very, very brief.-It's pretty old, and hasn't aged too well in most areas.-It's gone too quickly.-The story is stupid. Not even funny stupid, just flat out stupid. It's not offensive or anything, though.-And yeah, it's length is insufficient.-By now I'm so proficient in this game I can complete any mission of either campaign with just the starting bow and arrows, armorless and without consuming health potions. Send help.-It's clock-time isn't all too great.Yes, you could say I'm crazy, but I'd be far too busy hearing you over the dying grunts of an orc being shot in the neck by my magical arrows to notice.Far as I'm concernd, 10/10. Would shoot hundreds of enemies in the neck with magical armor-piercing arrows again.-Sleepy"

The graphics hold up fairly well and the game supports modern widescreen resolutions (although the menus are all pre-rendered to 4:3). The game does seem to crash without warning sometimes, but not even that was enough to prevent me from enjoying everything this game had to offer. Completing both campaigns took me about eight hours.The combat is very basic, but I found it oddly satisfying. Just hit things until they die. In each level you can choose from a selection of characters and then outfit them with various weapons, magic and equipment using the gold you find scattered in each area. Finding the most overpowered loadouts and putting them to use is a lot of fun and makes the difficulty of the later levels a lot more tolerable.The story and setting of Enclave certainly could be described as 'generic western fantasy,' but I did find some of the visual designs to be quite interesting and original. The music is fairly standard stuff, but is effective. I would recommend this game if you like old PC fantasy games and can put up with the possiblity of crashes."

Progressing through levels poses a moderate challenge.

,Not Recommended,253980,9987335,"Posted: 1 May, 2014",all,Herr Latour,"I'm not sure why this is advertised as an RPG, as ""Enclave"" is an Action game. It's not an Action RPG, it's not even an Action game with RPG elements, unless ""there are several characters who can use different weapons"" counts as one. There are no dialogues, no character stats, no development, no quests, no (semi-) open world to discover, and most importantly of all, there's no role-playing.Naturally an Action game can be a nice experience as well, but sadly, ""Enclave"" isn't. For once, this is because there's hardly any gameplay. You can walk, jump, attack, and raise your shield in defense - that's it. It's really your basic ego-shooter range of actions. The combat feels incredibly clunky. Your attacks seldomly seem to connect, arrows go through the enemies without causing damage even if they're right in front of you; melee weapons flail wildly and hit everything but your foe. Combat doesn't feel rewarding in any way.The missions are terribly simple as well. You'll always get several aims you need to complete, but it all comes down to ""run through the tube-levels and kill everything"". There's also a bunch of gold lying around in the levels, granting you access to other (read: stronger) weapons in the next one. The first couple of levels (which I played) feature only two basic types of enemies: small guys and big guys. It's boring, plain and simple.On the pro side, the game environments look really nice. The story seemed alright, too, but I just couldn't be bothered to continue playing the game to find out how it unfolds.I can see why it would still spark nostalgia today for those who played ""Enclave"" when it was first released, but I just can't recommend buying it now, not even for 99 cents."
76561198085466689,Recommended,253980,30234739,Posted: 27 February,all,Gabba Gandalf,"I'll try to be as fair as possible with this game. I've played both campaigns on difficult setting with 100% gold, though I had sometimes the urge to just quit the game. First of all, the game looks neat, especially by 2002 standards, the basics of gameplay are pretty easy to learn, the AI is ok and the soundtrack is really atmospheric. So much for the positive aspects of the game.The story is rather lame, run-of-the-mill fantasy with some steampunk elements. But the cutscenes and the presentation of the story make up a little for the weak story.The biggest problem with the game are the messed up hitboxes. And that's a big issue in a hack 'n slash game. Arrows going right through enemies, melee fighters can't hit enemies on stairways if they are below them and missiles going right through massive obstacles. That seems to be intended for magic missiles, but I have noticed some examples where enemy bowmen attacked me through a solid wall while I couldn't hit them, which is pretty frustrating. Also, the 1st person view is rather glitchy, especially in narrow spaces.The balancing is a mess. Sorcerers spam homing missiles at you which drain 1/4 of your life AND do damage over time while most melee fighters are push overs. Since the overall difficulty isn't very high (except for level 13 in the light campaign, that one was really tough), you can rush through most of the levels. You can beat this game with difficult setting and a 100% score in less than 15 hours.I've never even read a single word about bugs referring to this game, but it has its fair share of them. Enemies dropping of cliffs who were supposed to drop gold => 100% no achievable. Traps not triggering. Even important NPCs tend to get stuck in the environment, so you have to start all over again. To be fair, most of the levels are pretty short (sometimes even ridiculously tiny), so that's not a big problem.In summary this game could have used a lot of testing, it feels a little unfinished in some places. But for 5 € you can't go wrong, and as a hack n slash fan you should definitely try this one out."

You get a certain amount of money each level and you can look for optional bonus gold by finding it hidden in spots on the map or certain enemies that are optional to kill which will drop gold upon death.The combat is really boring and flaky. You just swing and shoot arrows constantly at enemies who dodge them like they know when your shooting. The boss combat is also bland and uninteresting.

The game gets hung up from time to time, but typically pressing alt tab and then back will fix it. I just beat the light missions 100% on medium and I'm going for the dark missions next.

The first few steps of a storied team.Your first mistake will be to think that this is a roleplaying game in the slightest. It is not. Campaigns are divided into an odd 13 missions (14 for Light), and you begin each one by picking a class and loadout. Collecting gold within levels only increases the amount you can purchase with your persistent loadout.This was originally intended as a multiplayer experience, perhaps even solely multiplayer, and it shows. From ""You are leaving the mission"" messages when you stray too far from the intended game arena, to several ""Capture the Castle"" missions left wholesale in the Dark Campaign.For the most part this isn't actually a bad thing. It lends itself positively in some other areas - the variety of playstyles is appreciated, and the open-ended levels (whilst obviously meant to accommodate multiple players) make the levels infinitely more interesting than if they were linear. This has all the trappings of a typical Pandemic title in a single-player only package.However, your second mistake is to buy this game, because it's terrible.It's a real letdown that it is. The graphics are nice - much better than the screenshots let on, with some of the Dark Campaign levels being outright beautiful. The character models are comparable to Fable's in quality and art direction, both of which have aged very well, and even the OST is excellent, with battle music and environmental shifting out of each other seamlessly.Though the VA is terrible (narrators aside), it's endearingly so, with exaggerated movements to make up for their lack of emoting that only early 3D titles could provide.Enclave is terrible because it plays terrible.Melee is a wet fish slapping affair, madly bashing the single attack button as you desperately play footsies in a sad display that makes QWOP look elegant, and ranged will see you backpeddle through entire levels as you fish for headshots (along with some hopelessly onesided shootouts against the lazer-sighted AI), In both cases, the hitboxes are completely shot, with both melee and ranged strikes regularly phasing through opponents. Even when you do connect, don't expect any hitstun as you continue dancing like a puppet held by a Parkinson's patient, because this is still a multiplayer title in all but name,It's a disgrace that makes shovelware indie titles look good by comparison. You feel like you're compensating for lag that isn't there, trying to play by the rapidly shifting rules of this broken shoddy gameplay.You shouldn't buy this game, and I don't recommend it. Not because of the ""aging graphics"", or the pricetag, or even the single save file that gets annoying when your Dark Campaign overwrites the unlocks of your Light Campaign, but because even when compared to its contemporaries, it is an absolute nightmare to actually play.Enclave, a sloppy start to a long career, belongs to the annals of time. You should move on to greener pastures."

As you collect gold in the levels you buy better gear and you can replay the levels after you complete them with any unlocked character to look for the missed gold. There are both light and dark campaigns to unlock 2 hidden characters not seen in the campaign and there is a config hack to unlock console commands but it is reccommended to back up your save before you try it.

I played it at least 100 hours back then.I'm surprised to see how good this game still is:Graphics are dated, but not some puked textures or anything it does create the atmosphere.Combat system is actually amazing, it takes some time to master but not much, for example to hit the opponent on top of the head with hammer or mace you need to go backwards and trigger the hit before moving forwards to actually hit the enemy. It might seem like brainless hack and slash but it is only if you play same level for too many times using exactly same class. Having no shield allows faster weapon switching. As well as for example triggering hit to the left and then going the same direction to which hitting while catching an opponent coming against the hit maximizes damage, ofcourse for combat without a shield its better to choose faster moving class then knight.However animations might not fit with actual damage, but once you understand combat system that doesnt really bother you anymore, because you rarely miss, the thing of being unable to hit close moving targets with ranged weapons is very realistic, even if animation shows that arrow supposed to hit the target, it's nearly as hard to shoot in close range as in real combat as well as daggers has best accuracy in close range, which is quite realistic, you cant really swing some weapons effectively in very close range.Read the item descriptions some clearly says that weapon is awkward to swing in close, due long spike or something, but if you start swing from far and go close to target while swinging it's no longer awkward.9.5/10 as for game released in 2003 I would love improved and new enclave, probably would be something as dark as dark souls, just easier."

Otherwise the game will be unplayable, and run really fast with a slight bit of lag. I play it on Vista.Like I said it's pretty much run through each level, kill enemy's, collect hidden gold, wash, and repeat until bored. The enemy's are the same.

That's it. No skill points, leveling, choices, etc..That being said, it's still an enjoyable action game. Here are the most important things to know;- The stages are pretty short but non-linear. Most of them have a fair amount of secrets and finding them will allow you to bring more and/or better weapons to the next stage. Most stages can probably be completed in a couple minutes if you just run through them though.- The combat feels a bit weird at first, but after playing for a short while you'll get the hang of it. The wonky hitboxes are probably the only negative thing I can say about it.- Early stages are quite easy and can be completed without too much effort. However, it seems that the difficulty suddenly raises quite a bit later on and you'll find yourself changing loadouts trying to find the one best suited for the stage. The game wants you to try new characters and playstyles. I really liked this but maybe others won't.- There is a light and dark campaign, and a surprising amount of lore in the game. A lot of cutscenes too, but all of them can be skipped and you don't have to care for the story if you don't want to.- The graphics are... well, look, the game is over 10 years old. Is this really important? Look at the screenshots, that's what you get.It's an old game and didn't age all too well, so a lot of people won't enjoy it for very long, even at its low price.

I also enjoy how characters are unlocked as you save them from some situation through the story missions. The combat is a frantic flailing about which I actually enjoyed.

As for graphics they aren't bad, sound is ok, but gameplay is horrible. You basically get to gather gold coins while you kill some monsters in the ""levels"" which allow you to pick weapons and armor for your level playthroughs. Combat is as simple as face the monster and push the mouse button until dead. You have range combat which is ok for sniping at the start of encounters that you can snipe, a early headshot gives you extra damage, plus some foes like archers like to sit out of melee range requiring you to use a ranged weapon often.Now as to the bad parts, the game really is just ""go through the level kill any foes that are there and collect gold coins"". Thats it. Its like Mario with sword and crossbow. Your goal is to get all the gold coins in the level and finish it, which will unlock other characters to play, and lets you choose better items during each mission beiefing. The bad part about the game is that there isn't really any save points other than start mission-finish mission. If you die during the mission either 1 of 2 things happen. 1, if you didn't reach a ""checkpoint"" you have to redo the whole mission from start. If you did reach a checkpoint, you rez at the checkpoint, but lose gold, which means you can't collect all the gold coins in the mission which is why you are doing the mission in the first place, thus, making you restart from the beginning.This is especially annoying in missions where the bad jump mechanics make you fall down a hole and die often, or hit a trap badly, or something else making you pull your hair out having to re-do missions over and over from the very beginning. Sadlly this bad game mechanic made me quit the game very early just gritting my teeth over ""hey, we are going to make a badly designed jump mechanic in the game, which by the way will get you killed a lot making you restart that annoying mission where you have bad jump mechanics to die, over and over. Have fun."".Sorry, not fun, and I didn't think twice after quitting and deleting the game and moving on to a much better game."

There's no real strategy to it, you just run up and spam left click to do your combos. You can use a shield but it isn't very useful since it doesn't knock an enemy back when they hit it or stun them. You will often find your strikes missing even though you can clearly see that your weapon hit the enemy. Just assume that your weapon is always half as long as it looks to be. Your enemies are also usually just as fast if not faster than you. Once they get close there's no escaping them, they'll stick to you like a tick until you kill them. That can be pretty annoying when you have to fight groups of enemies at once. I got this for 59 cents and for its time I can see that it would have been a good game but melee combat has become more complex since then. It all feels very dated and is honestly pretty boring."

Melee combat is ♥♥♥♥ing pointless and mages are hilariously OP as long as you can manage your mana.You don't typically level so much as each stage you complete has gold hidden in it, as well as a set reward at the end of each stage. You get that gold, and can use it on items at the start of missions. You don't buy it permanently, just for that character for that mission, although you keep the gold if that makes sense. This rewards exploration, which isn't bad. What is bad is that it's typically hidden in the most ridiculous places, sometimes involving parkour, and if you die on anything but easy after you've hit a checkpoint, you start the level over.That being said, I got it for $0.99, so it was worth it at that price.

The melee fighting never gets good, eventually your weapon will one hit kill most enemies, except a few stronger ones with 10x more hitpoints.

Killing them with a sword doesn't work because their AI spams their attack nonstop, and their attack is just as fast as yours, so you end up trading damage - which could work if you buy lots of potions.The third person crossbow shooting is kind of fun, and the level designs are interesting.It's a decent game if you like third person shooters and can get it on sale or in a bundle."

It's not a matter of graphics or controls with this game, so much as its fault being in its boring landscapes, strangely disjointed combat and utterly generic feel.

It rides its way comfortably into the safe zone of action/adventure gaming set in a bland and uninteresting medevial world devoid of anything that might make it stand out of the hundreds of its boring and generic cousins at the bottom of the value priced games you find in a cardboard bin at a department store, left to wallow in all they're boring blandness. for $0.82, it is ok, but for full price of $5.60, I think I would rather go have some tempura dynamite sushi..Better that awful, but can't muster the strength to jump over that ""Berlin Wall of Generic Gaming"" fence - 5.5/10"

It's not that they are bad or are comparable to a game like Nidhogg, however you are able to see it's age by all of the flat and repeating textures, lack of any anti alising and even a few very pixely items.It also has to be mentioned that the menus do not have mouse support, meaning you have to use the arrow keys, Enter and Esc to navigate the menus.That being said Enclave can be a fairly fun experience if you enjoy it's combat and exploration, the only problem being that the combat is very simple, somewhat cluncky and even unreliable as far as the hitboxes go when it comes to using ranged weapons close up to enemies. No matter who you choose to play as (will be explained upon better later in the review) it feels like an M1 spam fest as that is your only way of attacking with your sword/axe/hammer/dagger. Your other other ways of doing damage is (depending on the character) by pulling out your crossbow/bow/staff, and pressing M1. For it's time it was OK however in a day and age where we have a long list of games with numerous abilities and ways of doing damage, Enclave begins to show it's age. Though it has to be said that the combat is fairly satisfying. When you pull off a combo (depending on the weapon, M1 x Type Of Melee Weapon) the last hit will do double damage, and even give the attack splash damage so any nearby enemy will also take damage. This alone isn't much, but paired with a nice 'smashing' sound and a little bit of screen shake, it truely does feel good when you finish off multiple enemies with your final swing.Exploration is a different story, whereas the age of Enclave has been hurting it, Enclave shows how older games did their exploration and it made you want to explore the land you were put in. When you start a mission you are put inside a medium/large sized area where there are a number of pickups that will become extremely important in your journey through each level, and ultimately the game itself. You will come across ammo pick ups for your crossbow/bow (may you have one on you or not), health potions, checkpoints and even gold. The health potions and ammo are given and taken away on a mission by mission basis, where you can find 3 potions in a mission, however they will be taken away after the mission is over.The gold on the other hand is collected and kept for a equipment screen you will use before each mission. When you select your mission, you will be given the option of who you want to use for that mission. Each character has their own loadout (the Druid is the only one who can use staffs, etc.) that you can fill up, which is where the gold comes into play. You use the gold as more of a borrowing system then a buying system seeing as you choose your items from the equipment screen by just swapping through them, taking or returning gold depending on the quaility/quantity of the item. An easier way of thinking of it is by switching out gold with a weight system. Instead of gaining +5 gold, you picked up +5 max weight, allowing you to use better/more weapons/armour/ammo/health potions. The better equipment comes back to help you complete more difficult missions and get more gold.If you enjoyed playing through the game once then you will be very happy to know that there are actually TWO campaigns to Enclave, the Light side where you face the forces of evil, and a more difficult Dark campaign where you face the forces of good. Besides that there are hoard mode missions on both sides of of the game where you face increasingly difficult groups of enemies to gain gold for the main missions and other hoard missions. These missions can be found by finding maps in the main missions which will open up a new spot on the mission select screen.All in all, Enclave can be a fun game if you can get past the fact that it's over 10 years old and has nearly everything that comes with it being old. Personally I wouldn't buy it for $5.00 US dollars, but if you can get it while it's on sale (75%+), then I would recommend giving it at least an hour of your time just so you can at least experience what Enclave has to offer. It's not a bad game, it's just dated."

Aiming is awful, and even if your reticle ""guarantees"" a hit by turning red, you may still miss.  There are some suddenly falling floors or traps in the game that lead to instant death, which is fairly sinful in a game that requires you start the entire stage over upon character death.  Melee attacking has its own problems too, in that every encounter is basically a slap fight with weapons.  Hit detection is iffy and any nuance like spacing or positioning is out the window.  Click, click, click.  Beyond that, the game is still fun and looks ok, player models aside.I can't recommend this to anyone but the morbidly interested.   It's not all bad, but it would have been a 6/10 in 2002.  If you just need something to play, then maybe go for it?  Or work on your backlog first, you lazy bum."

EVERY TIME you click the ""Play"" button, it will open a browser tab and show the steam page for a different game from the same company.That could create a stupid situation in which you have the game loading in the foreground and a video loading in the background at the same time - IF I could get the game to load right from start.For some reason, though, I have to kill the game process and start it again, otherwise the game simply won't open. As a result, it will load the same steam page TWICE.Can we have a round of applause for that awful business decision? They managed to make me hate their company even before I could load up the game for the first time, and that is something not even Electronic Arts had done before. Impressive.Well, after actually loading the game, I found out it's quite generic and unimaginative. There's some loooong narration to set the scenario but it's not particularlly interesting or engaging.The battles are boring and repetitive. Run up to an enemy, hit him, step back. Rinse, repeat. And you'll have to repeat that a lot, because the hit boxes are very small and it's very common to miss swings that should have connected.I couldn't feel a real sense of progression. There are no shopkeepers, but you can buy your equipment from a virtual shop before starting a mission. Didn't find any loot besides coin, potion and the starting sword/shield. There's a limited amount of money you can find in each level too.So far the game looks ugly and boring, but those are subjective aspects and they might not prevent you from actually enjoying Enclave.However, there is a very objective issue that can and most likely will ruin your day.Enclave has a tendency to crash with a message that says ""UNRECOVERABLE ERROR FOUND, press any key to close"". It can happen anywhere, any time, for any reason or for no reason at all.Well, if you're thinking""I could live with the occasional crash"", think again, becauseyou cannot save the game. There are a few checkpoints scattered around the maps and you will respawn in one of them if you die, butif the game crashes, all your progress is lost- you will have to restart the mission from the beginning. All the puzzles, all the enemies, all the traps and doors - you will have to do everything again.Unfortunately, the game crashesfrequently. It happened six times in the two hours I tried to play. I wanted to keep going but it felt like a chore and I wasn't having fun anymore.I didn't have great expectations (it was only a dollar after all), but  Enclave still managed to let me down.I can't in good faith recommend this game."

What make matters worse - game doesn't react to keyboard keys bound to gamepad buttons, so I had to stick with mouse + KB. And yes, you cannot use mouse in main menu (makes sense since it's a console game in first place).2) The gameplay itself constantly suffers from random camera spins, random teleportation of your character and sometimes illogical reaction to commands - it can react slowly to button presses, it can execute your attacks way faster than usual. Hitboxes are quite off as well, in fact they are so off from visuals that it's obvious just a few minutes into the game.I see no point in describing the gameplay itself since I didn't see much, the only thing I can point out is that the combat is really too simple and narrows down to some kind of hit-n-run M1 spam, ranged weapons are almost unusable due to technical issues described earlier.

76561198038892067,Recommended,253980,13169265,"Posted: 30 November, 2014",all,kaay,"Enclave is a fantasy action game. You unlock new characters with different weapons and abilities as you play and depending on your saved budget and unlocked items, you can equip your selected character with a choice of weps, armor and potions, and thats pretty much all the ""rpg"" aspect.The game has a story which is not bad but pretty basic and you can play it from the perspective of two opposing factions, you can chose the ""light"" or dark"" campaign at the begining of the game and you will get to play different characters with different stories.The game stands out by its very well made fantasy setting and an excellent soundtrack. Personally i found the graphics and the music to be outstanding back in the day.The graphics aged of course but they aged quite well, for the most part they look good even by today standards. They might be technically dated but artistically they are still great.The combat is solid and quite varied for a hack and slash game. The choice of character is vital because the game is pretty difficult and some characters will do a lot better than others in certain levels. Every level can be completed with any character but the difference in difficulty can be unforgiving.The levels are not very big but most of them are intricated enough to allow some exploration in search for hidden stuff.It was one of my fave PC action games back in 2003 but i still enjoy playing it today."

Also thought it was a glitch so i restarted it many times aswell.PS- I finally found that there was a lever that was at the first room with out any hint that it was there, besides from spamming MC2 (the use button in this game)On the second level, the main idea from the ""compainion"" was that you needed to defeat a few, easy monsters, simple right? Well yeah they were easy, but after you defeated them i could not go anyware, only advice from the so called ""compainion"" was ""We need to protect the Outpost!"" Well, ok, lets go! But there was nothing there, not even a letter or another monster to lead way, NOTHING! You could not go back where you came from or open or destroy any doors, so what then? Well i wasted another, rough 30 min (In my opinion) looking for something, and because i am pretty tolerant towards games i, restarted it many times to see if it was a glitch. NOPE . . .Disappointed in this game, had hopes for it.Although there are Pro's and Con's with every game here are a few i can sayPro'sConstant 60fpsNote bad graphics for 2003Unique game style (names areas and ect.)Fast load time*For you to decide*Con'sNo help (beside from ""what buttons do what"")Short areasBad voice actors (sounds dull and not into the game style)Either buggy or hard (could just be me)*For you to decide*PS- These are just my opinions so do not take offence to this if you enjoy this game!"

( The genre tag was placed by users not the developer ) Its a solid action game with lots of combat and light platforming.The combat is loose ( not very precise ) but because hit detection is forgiving it makes combat fast and fun, and there is a good variety of weapons in the game to keep you interested. In fact variety is one of the games strengths, there are several characters you can play in the campaign and you can choose freely before every level which one you want to play and every character specializes in different weapons and attributes so they all are very different to play ( most have exclusive abilities. ) And the most unique part of the game, adding even more variety, is that there is a good and evil campaign and you can choose either one to play, this isnt just a gimmick either both campaigns have there very own story and levels. ( Each side has there own version of each class and character ) Speaking of those levels, level design is excellent. Levels are labrynth style with lots  of hidden gold to find and even if they are short they still provide exploration. Also the levels have a good amount going on with lots of scripted enviromental changes ( Such as falling walls and ceilings ) and props ( like shootable cannons ), the geometry is always changing from tight cordoors to wide open enviroments with lots of verticality such as muti-story buildings and archway bridges. Finally the enemy placement is great as well as you will be suprised often by enemies that hide around or rush around corners, down stairways, etc or how archers that nest up in high vantage points or off in the distance. Overall some good engaging level design.What also must be said is how good the game looks in 1080p concidering it is over 10 years old. Textures look great ( not quite as much if you get really close though ). Art design is amazing, all the architecture and details put into the enviroment surpass alot of games today and it has aged remarkably well, seriously what other game from 2002 looks this good today. The only gripe I have is that character models and animations are old and stiff, but still nothing too terrible.The game isnt perfect of coarse. A.I. can and will be dumb ( there are times that your enemy will just stand there and take hits especially if there are more than one enemy at a time ). The spending of gold is very strange as it is never actually expended but more a value of how much or with what a character is equiped with before they enter the level. Also the game only saves between levels and there are only a couple of checkpoint in level at most, if you die before you reach a checkpoint you will have to repeat everything you did in that level. The game has some balancing issues such as the sorceress character is overpowered as she is basically a machine gun spellcaster. But still this is a steal for 5$ and especially on sale."

I saw the graphics, and said ""Wow, this looks really good for 2003!"" Well, looks and plays are two different things, my friend.To compliment this game, yes, it actually has very nice visuals. Nothing groundbreaking by todays standards, but for its time, they were pretty good. Aside from that? This is kinda terrible. But! it does fall under ""So bad, it's good"". The combat is just an M1 fest, with absolutely no strategy. Simplicity is one thing, but this is pretty braindead. Enemies either just stand there and take it or run. Actually, I gotta say, the combat reminds me of Kings Field on ps1...all the bad aspects of it. Run forward, slash once or twice, step backward, repeat. It's incredibily dull, to say the least. Oh, and hit collision is choppy.Not much to say about music or voice acting, nothing stood out. Nothing good, nothing horrible, it's all just kind of...there. The game is very linear. Now, I actually don't have a problem with a game being linear. However, this game is insultingly linear. Not Hallway Simulator 13 linear, mind you, but pretty damn close.Overall, Enclave feels kinda like the testing stages for a game. Like, they just finished the engine, impleminted the basic features, but shipped it out before it could be polished up. I guess I could compare it to a beat-em up, but without the satisfaction from said beating up. Can't say I recommened, Enclave, unless you feel like burning a dollar while it's on sale."

I have only played the first 15 minutes of this game. My first complaint is that the game is very glitchy. What I mean is that, I can't walk in a straight line because the game keeps teleporting me either in front of me or behind me. This is beyond annoying. My second major problem with the game is how clunky the gameplay is - it takes almost too long to swing a ♥♥♥♥ing sword and the AI is terrible. The voices of the characters is also very annoying and bad. This may be possibly the WORST game I have ever played on Steam. I am very dissapointed that I just wasted $5 on a game that I thought would be like Fable - an MMO, RPG (which what it was casted under) that I thought I could enjoy. The game starts off terrible too, you start off in a jail cell with an insane lady threatening to kill you. Then you get shot at with a giant catapult (the game is set in olden ages) and you have to escape through a hole. I won't spoil the rest. I get that this game was made awhile ago, but the game looks absolutely terrible. Even with all of the textures and normal video settings, the game looks terrible. I must also remind that the developers had absolutely no idea on what resolutions were. My moniter has a resolution of 1440x900 and when I switched to it, it gave me a resolution of 800x600 in a letterbox style. This was absolutely annoying to have to go through and find a decient resolution that didn't look half as bad. I could go on all day about how BAD this game was.

,Recommended,253980,11982073,"Posted: 4 September, 2014",all,Ailuri Valyx,"I was genuinely surprised when I picked this up for $0.94. First of all, after looking at the graphics in the screenshots, I was shocked to read this game is from 2003. The graphics are absolutely wonderful for its time, and even don't look half bad by today's standards; the fact that 1920x1080 is a supported resolution is just icing on the cake. (only the game textures support 1080p though, so the backgrounds look horrendus.) It reminded me a bit of the Champions series mixed with The Witcher.The combat feels satisfying, aside from the stiffness and slight repetition; timing your blocks and blows is very immersive and can make you forget how clunky other aspects of the game can be.All that being said, there is a slight problem with misdirection; this can be justified a bit because a lot of games from this time didn't exactly hold your hand, but there were times when I had no idea what to do, and only when I backtracked (or maybe just moved on to an identical area; I don't know), did the game move forward. Certain NPCs don't follow you when they should and seem to have the ability to teleport if you don't stay right on them.All in all, I'd say it's worth the $0.94 I paid for it, though I don't know as if I would have bought it at full price. It's certainly worth a play, and it's enjoyable enough to justify the price, even if you only play it a few times.tl;dr: Can be misleading at times, but the combat and graphics are nice."

However, the controls, especially in combat, feel very inaccurate and inconsistent.  Evclave was basically a hack n slash the way I played it, just attacking continuously except to heal occasionally.  Sometime what you are supposed to do is very vague as well.  I got stuck on the second level because I had no idea what to do, and there weren't really any noticeable pointers toward what ended up being a cannon near me.Overall, this game is worth it with a discount, but has somewhat aggravating controls.

,Recommended,253980,18230325,"Posted: 27 September, 2015",all,Graced by Autumn,"First released in 2002 on Microsoft's Xbox, Enclave later witnessed a PC release in 2003. Though Enclave is without a doubt not without its flaws, it's still a very enjoyable game that offers a considerable degree of replay value.Enclave picks up after the end of a brutal war between the Kingdom of Celenheim and the forces of the demon lord Vatar, known as the Dreg'Atar. During the final battle between these two warring factions, the wizard Zale gives his life to cast a spell that tears the land asunder, thus preventing the Dreg'Atar from sending reinforcements to aid their main force. One thousand years later however, the rift separating Celenheim from the rest of the land begins to close and Vatar prepares to rise once again to take control of his mighty armies. Although Enclave places little emphasis on character development, the game still manages to present a fairly interesting narrative, driven to a greater degree by the events of the story rather than the characters. Siding with either Celenheim or the forces of the Dreg'Atar outland tribes, you assume control of a collection of nameless characters who are entrusted with important tasks by their leaders, that eventually lead them on a journey across the rift and beyond. Key developments in the plot are depicted primarily through a number of short, in-game cut-scenes. While Enclave's story doesn't do anything spectacular, it does present a few unexpected twists and turns towards the end, resulting in a satisfying and decent plot that gives context to the main characters' actions.After choosing a side, the player embarks upon a number of missions that lead them through various locales, including deserted temples, castles, forested areas protected by elemental guardians and virtually every other setting that one might expect to come across in a typical D&D setting. Each mission usually involves getting from A to B whilst collecting gold and defeating the numerous enemies that block your path, in some cases acquiring several key items along the way.Between missions you'll be given an opportunity to change the selected player character as well as his/her equipment, with the ability to purchase new weapons and armour using the gold collected during missions. Characters are divided into one of three types, including those focusing upon melee attacks, ranged attacks and magic-based attacks. While melee characters are capable of wielding strong melee weapons and shields, their ranged combat skills are somewhat lacking. Ranged characters in comparison are adept in the use of bows, but have no means with which to block enemy attacks, while magic-based characters are able to attack foes from a distance as well as block enemy attacks at the expense of some mana. For the most part this formula works well and the missions feel well-paced with plenty of action, and moments of respite when required.Near the end of the game, the unavailability of checkpoints on the highest difficulty setting can become a minor annoyance, as you approach the final portion of a long mission, only for a key character to die, thus forcing you to restart the mission from the very beginning. None of the missions from either of the campaigns are all that long, but it’s still an issue all the same, if only because it’s a step in the wrong direction: one that’s directed towards the introduction of ‘artificial difficulty’. If you already figured out how to get past a section of a specific level and died during the next section, then why is there any need to repeat the former part of the level? Surely the player should be allowed to re-attempt only the part they failed at, rather than re-doing every area that they already demonstrated they know how to get past. After all, that’s exactly what happens on the default difficulty level. Repeating portions of a mission you’ve already done doesn’t add any extra difficulty – it just adds padding. A greater issue however is the mission design itself. Some missions are clearly geared towards a certain character, which becomes evident after the fifth failed attempt at making it past the third group of enemies encountered, after choosing a character whom the developers didn't seem to expect anyone to choose for that particular mission. A prime example of this can be seen in the penultimate mission from the Celenheim campaign, in which the player is presented at the start of the level with a powerful melee-focused enemy, as well as a minimum of two ranged combatants who can easily whittle down a magic-based character's mana by forcing them to stop incoming attacks, before reducing their health to zero within mere seconds. Hit detection issues are also present, though this is more noticeable when playing as a ranged character.Most of the time the AI does a good job of presenting you with clever and fierce adversaries to fight, but on rare occasions enemies will freeze up and stand on the spot until you move past a certain invisible line drawn on the ground. Other times enemies can be easily fooled into committing suicide by walking into environmental hazards. One mission in which this can be put into practice sees the player coming to shore and arriving on a beach guarded by a few ranged combatants. If the player moves close enough to each one, they'll draw their melee weapons and proceed to follow the player wherever they go – including into the water, which proves fatal for them (though for some reason, not the player).Despite these flaws, Enclave's gameplay is still a very fun and enjoyable experience, and the option of replaying most of the missions as any character from that mission's respective campaign ensures a great deal of replay value, even if this can sometimes present some scenarios that are nearly impossible for certain characters to overcome. Then again, experimenting is fun right?Most of the character models are fairly well detailed, though some of the characters' faces are lacking in areas and look too basic in comparison to the rest of the model. Environments also benefit from a high-level of detail and lighting effects, the latter which often create a powerful atmosphere for each setting. Water has been surprisingly well animated and; from a distance; looks fantastic. A scene that stands out as a prime example of this can be found during a mission titled 'The Sanctuary' while staring out towards a lake set against the backdrop of a golden sunset, as the sunlight reflects of the water.Enclave features a subtle, if well-crafted soundtrack. Each track lends itself to give each setting a unique feel, even though a number of tracks are re-used for certain missions. Dynamic music adjusts to fit the situation, with its tempo increasing and decreasing when the player is in combat and out of combat respectively. The sounds of bowstrings being drawn, swords clashing and explosions going off all sound as they should. The majority of characters have also been well-voiced, though a few characters seem to have suffered in cases where their voice actor/actress has over-exaggerated and tried too hard.Enclave is a game that; despite its flaws; ends up being a relatively solid game with decent gameplay and an interesting plot to back it up. A fun game worth purchasing, even if it is a little rough around the edges."

Admittedly, I didn't get very far into the game before stopping, but having hit a game-breaking bug quite quickly I couldn't be bothered to reload the level I was playing.The game is from 2003 according to the store page, and for a game of that time it actually looks fairly good. However, I found that whilst you could defend with a shield, most of your combat experience (at least as a ""Knight"") would involve furiously circle-strafing and mashing the LMB to hit the rather stupid AI opponents.The allied AI isn't much better. In the second mission I managed to lose a friendly AI that should have been following me, and in the third mission, the AI and the scenery bugged out, causing the AI I was escorting to get fatally stuck on a door.Finally, the vast majority of the story (from what I could tell) was relayed through skippable cutscenes, making it all to easy to lose track of what was going on. There was no obvious way to receive cues on the story whilst in the game itself either, making it quite hard to follow.Overall, the experience was somewhat frustrating, and I'd give this game a miss."

Where? Just get the best equipment and gogogo- actual combat, the worst meele combat I have chance to witnessed, the worst part of it - you are swinging your weapon against enemy and nothing happens unless you are very specifically turned towards your enemy, even though it looks like you should be hitting all enemies in radius of 90+ degrees (graphics) the reality is about from 30 - 40, for me the most frustrating part of this game- cheap deaths (applies for gold collectors only, fall into lava, pit etc., you just must restart whole level if you want 100% of gold coins)- AI - shooting with a crossbow/bow in this game is absolutely delightful (sarcasm) - AI jumps like mad (seriously you must see it to understand) and it is almost impossible, also stucks behind objects sometimes cant even follow you upstairs etc..Result: Mediocre, but those frustrating parts I have written down (camera, combat system...) will follow you throughout this whole game therefore -> not worth it (I have bought it for 0.99 Eur, so for this price it is decent)"

I thought for the low sale price i might as well, When I opened the game there was no adverts or web page that opened so they must have removed it. it's a shame that  such a good game is let down by a mistake someone has now fixed.the actual gameplay review:The gameplay is excellent. for me the story plot is the interesting part of this game I find myself wanting to know what has happened and the game really does feel immersive. the game controls and actions are ok but not the best mallee attack are pretty solid along with the block move but the ranged move are a little shaky, no where near as bad as some people in other reviews have made them out to be however.The actual game characters aren't the best, the first character seems good and well made but the female characters like the druid and the second character you get the huntress i think it is are not as good as they could have been. the main problem I have with them is the action noises they make, it sounds like a child sighing, but to be honest that seems to be as bad as it gets.It seems to me that this is an ok game. It’s just been let down because the game creators annoyed everyone by advertising other games in the actual game which is no longer the case because they fixed that. they are probably trying to boost positive reviews by making the game so cheap and fix the bad reviews but bugger it, it's a good game I got it for about £0.60 so I can’t complain.I just noticed the price just went up to £3.99 while I was writing this.

Halfing or Goblin Warrior can be super fun though with a good axe and well timed attacks.The game offers some exploration element in the form of finding gold hidden throughout the levels.  The gold can be used to unlock better gear.  One thing I appreciate is that you get full price back for selling old items and consumables give you the listed amount at the start of levels.  This means that there is essentially no grinding!"

Only bested by Severance : Blade of Darkness at that time. I like this game, even if it has some little problems left. The graphics are still okay imo, the combat gets boring after a while but that's the case in most games I guess. There are lots of weapons and different characters to play. Two campaigns, too bad you first have to unlock the dark campaign by beating the light campaign.Buy it in sale if you like this type of game."

To everyone else, this game is clunky, dated, and requires Controller Companion in order to operate correctly. Had I not originally played this circa 2003-2004, I'm not really sure if I'd enjoy it at all.However, considering I was touched by this game briefly when it was new, playing it to completion on PC (numerous times) has been rewarding time and time again. The $5 price tag is more than worth it, for the small few of us."
