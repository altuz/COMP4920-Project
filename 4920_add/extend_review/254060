It has decent controls but hilariously bad dialogue. the characters all sound like Microsoft Sam and the there were times where every single word in an NPC's speach would end in the suffix ""eth."" If I had to explain the story of this game I would just say ""thiseth iseth theeth adventureseth ofeth microsoft Prince John, Heeth goeseth arroundeth andeth killseth stuffeth."""
,Recommended,254060,9714543,"Posted: 3 April, 2014",all,Taternator - God Of Benchpress,"Truly one of my favourite games of all time. I would estimate that I have somewhere around 1000 hours into the Once Upon A Knight disc version, and I am not sure of the differences between KnightShift and Once Upon A Knight, other than that KnightShift is the European version. I would recommend this game if you can stand to not have the latest graphics, but do enjoy a sometimes humorous RPG. The campaigns are decent, but I could have spent days turning my enemies into cows in the skirmish mode. On top of that I do not remember any game-breaking bugs or issues of any kind from Once Upon A Knight, other than being addicted to it for quite some time. The game can appeal to different players, through the main story line campaigns, the rpg modes, skirmish battles, and the editor mode allowing you to make your own scenarios and maps, providing many, many hours of milk-spending entertainment! (Yup, ""milk-spending"", milk is one of the currencies, isn't that great?) While the graphics might not be up-to-date, which is what should be expected of an aging game, I feel that the gameplay greatly out-weighs that. I highly recommend this game!"
,Recommended,254060,9753283,"Posted: 7 April, 2014",all,⎛Illuminaughty Goat⎞,"I fail to see how this game is broken, buggy or unplayable (according to other reviewers, they almost always had issues with this game). This game sure has aged a lot, but it still has the unique feel and setting that isn't present in any other game (even the Witcher, which is also heavily based on Slavic mythology).Of course, it is very dated. Graphics may be ugly (but seriously, what do you expect from a game made in 2003?) if you compare this game to other, more modern ones. This game doesn't support any other display modes but letterbox (4:3). But since I'm not that kind of a guy who pays attention to graphics, it doesn't really bother me. The game's interface and controls are very intuitive and easy to learn, so both hardcore and ""casual"" (no pun intended) players can, IMO, enjoy it, provided that dated graphics won't distract them. I know I enjoy this game, and I've been a gamer since I was born. That's 19 years of experience.It has RPG and RTS modes, but they aren't very advanced (that is not a flaw to me, though). It also has a built-in editor - the kind that is fairly easy to learn to use - which allows you to create and share custom content. The possibilities are endless. Even if you are too lazy to make your own stuff, you can still look for some fan-made content on the Internet.This game has its' flaws, of course. It is not perfect. There are more complex RPGs and RTSs out there. There are games with prettier graphics. But since I am the kind of a guy who likes games that are simple to learn and present you with something challenging (not the gameplay, but the setting and/or story), I actually like this game.Personal rating: 7/10."

[deaf],"Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Game----------------------------------------KnightShift is a unique blend of RPG and top-down adventure.  It can be played as a strategy game, an RPG, or a hybrid mix.Seemingly very low-budget, KS still brings an interesting, if not intricate, gameplay to the gamer.  For those who can tolerate the lower-end graphics and quirkiness of the game (I find it cute how the prince takes a nap, for example, as odd as it is), KnightShift will bring a good round of exploratory gameplay in an indie package that I'd recommend for a fun few hours of Princedom.Overall Rating: 8/10Gameplay----------------------------------------Warning: There are a LOT of keys/key combinations to remember for this game.If you're undaunted, the next hurdle to overcome is a slightly awkward mouse control that seems to be reminiscent of Windows 98 mouse acceleration insanity.  Once familiarized with it, the mouse awkwardness stops detracting from the interface.I'm not sure if there were audio cues for some things, but I learned haphazardly that the giant withcraft looking areas are healing spas.  This was useful fighting my first few bears.  The lesson here is just to explore the areas, as context tooltips don't really exist to assist in understanding what is around you in the game.Although rough around the edges, the quirky gameplay and level-matched quests can catch you and lure you in for more from this game.  The random encounter fights contribute a little to exp farming and provide a balanced challenge as you build up your equipment set and character.Overall Accessibility----------------------------------------KnightShift has dialogue that is not subtitled, making the plot a little inconvenient to follow.  I don't blame the developers, who, as a small indie group, made the game because they wanted to, and did so as best they could.Because I was unable to properly test multiplayer, the overall rating is based on only the subtitles category.Rating: 7/10Subtitles/Text----------------------------------------KnightShift is an indie game on a unique platform.  That said, it's not subtitled or captioned.  Deaf/HoH players can still read the text of what was said after by hitting F2 a few times, which cycles through the 'mission log' and flavor text/mission text.At first I found it annoying, but I find the workaround tolerable and am happy they included it.Rating: 7/10Chatting/Communicating----------------------------------------While KS has multiplayer capability, I did not test.  Based on the keyboard options, I saw no key for chat.Rating: N/A"

Very Great game I'd rate it 10/10 and is one of the best RTS game's I have ever played. Online games can have around 7 players."

,Recommended,254060,10639510,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,Northern Star,"Love it. This game has a lot to it. There is an RPG mode, which is like a typical RPG... You go around and do quests and whatnot, and there are different ""games"" for you to pick from when you are in RPG mode. This allows you to play different stories and whatnot, as well as customize your character to have a TON of possible combos. There is also a Campaign mode, which is like the RPG one, but a bit more simplistic. Then, there is Skirmish, which is sort of like Civ, in the sense that you build a city and defend it. I personally prefer the Skirmish game mode, as it is very fun, and does not involve a lot of depth, which means you can play it at almost any time of the day."

,Recommended,254060,9322613,"Posted: 2 March, 2014",all,zel,"The game itself is teresting enough but being a title released in 2003 means it is lacking in much we've become accustomed to. For one, it seems to only work in 4:3 aspect ratio. The textures might have been ""good"" back in the day but are obviously dated now. The cutscene movies are also pretty dated. The spoken dialogue is remeniscent of old...  wait this is an old game...  so umm, the spoken dialogue represent what was about the 'norm' for 2003, though the script seems a bit hammy.All things considered, if you are the kind that doesn't mind the old-school feel of the game, you could come to enjoy it very much however I know a lot of people won't be able to get past that aspect of the game.I'd recommend this game only for people who like that old school feel."

Before you buy, check the forum and see all those threads about launching problems. This game is picky, so be warned!I guess you need a lot of patience to play this game. Took me about two month to get it to even pass the config tool. After about a hundred tries just out of nowhere it miraculously started to run today. When I changed the resolution it just quit and refused to run, but this time I could set it back to 800x600x32 and it actually worked again. It does not look too good, seriously, but I don't dare to mess with the config again. Everything is on best setting just the resolution is not.I tried out the RPG mode, just chapter one. The controls are a bit weird, but I guess with a little practice I can manage. I created a priestess and made her walk around for some time. She was cute, called me darling every once in a while. :)At one point I got butchered by three skeletons. My fault, you shall not stumble through hostile territory without caution. A bit frustrating was the fact, that the autosave had done the last save in the middle of battle so everytime I loaded it was insta death because I could not click that heal button fast enough. Sure there were two earlier saves, but honestly, you load the current one over and over again and try and try. Just this time you're going to be fast enough... well, you won't, so you give it another try... just this one.... you know what I mean. ;)So, I can't say it is a bad game. That would not be fair. But I surely did play better ones. If you get it for a buck just give it a try, you can't do much wrong for such a price. If you are not sure watch others playing it on youtube, that's what I did. I will definately try it again, I want to play all the characters at least once. Just not today..."

Enemies pose nearly no real threat at all, just click and watch the fight unfold. Very boring, very tedious, and does not run well on modern systems. Do not waste your time or money on this title.
