While the gameplay itself may not be up to 2013 RTS standards, the music, ambience, mission creativity, mechanics, and immersion are top notch for its time. Sure there are annoying pathing bugs and stupid AI, but it's definitely not gamebreaking. A nostalgic 10/10."

They are rather large skirmishes, and I mena LARGE, I was honestly surprised to see the number of AI you could add, it was this feature, really that made the game so much fun for me, the large scale rts battles made this well worth the, less than a dollar, I spent on it.

Good game though campaign content is a tough shallow for my liking compared to the length of other campaigns on the previous title mentioned.Good to pick up on sale for a play through as like the Earth series it has aged quite a bit and it isnt as easy to handle as more modern games. Still good for a bit of a laugh as you try to work around the terrible pathing and your army units dire need to run face first into any enemy they get a glance at without being told to just sit there :P3 Campaigns in it, which i enjoy getting the different flavours as it were of each nation in this conflict.If youve played earth 2150 before or dont mind spending some time doing the tutorials to learn how to work its controls and functionality then pick this one up."

Own team AI is where most of the problems are... can only set 3 basic tactics per unit/group... chase 'em, stand still, or stay within area. Even on stay within, you units often roam into areas they shouldn't and get picked off easy. Wost part is the route finding... the game relies on building many units and swarming when you outnumber the enemy... often groups of 15-20 units per group. But the pathfinding is bad. often the first 3 or 4 units head in the right direction, and the ones behind bump intoi them and then head off in another direction for an alternate, often with disasterous effects.Base building is pretty noddy too. no sign of upgrades for most buildings, just build one to access a certain list of units and then forget it. Having to manage power was a nice touch (each gen can power two nearby buildings) which gives some tactical options of blacking-out your enemy buildings... but most of the time you'll get mashed before you get near ur enemies gens.All in all this seems a dissapointing basic RTS cir 2000... if you want a very cheap nostagic RTS shot then grab it on sale, if not avoid, there are much better ones out there."

The release date of 2001 is in very small print.The videos above make it look like a modern game. However, these aren't in game graphics, just footage from cut scenes. When I bought this game, it was being advertised on the main Store screen as being ""new!"" However that is deliberately misleading and this has now become a very vocal and major issue of the way Steam is deliberately misleading it's customers (some are saying ""downright rip off"" on many gaming sites and gaming focused YouTube channels).I find this very sad as Steam used to be held in high regard by myself and many, many others for it's integrity and honesty to it's customers.As for the gameplay of WW3: Black Gold, it looks very dated now and has been left way behind by so many more modern games in the RTS genre. It just can't be compared to more modern RTS games in ANY possible way.I bought this game and before playing it, went to visit my big time PC gaming neighbour. By coincidence, he was playing the game and was ranting how he had been ""conned"" by Steam and cursing the game and it's gameplay. So I sat watching him playing it for a few hours, hoping it would get better the further he got into the game. It didn't.So when I got back home, I uninstalled it and never bothered with it again. So I haven't logged even a minute of gameplay on it on my own computer. What I saw at my friend's was enough for me.So when I want an RTS fix, I go for Company of Heroes 1 and 2, Starcraft 2 (both of the already finished games of the intended trilogy), the Warhammer RTS games and the Paradox Grand Strategy games such as Hearts of Iron 3 TFH, Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings 2, etc.So the lesson to be learned here is that Steam is quickly losing it's integrity and high regard in the gaming industry and so be careful to look at all the small print in the advertising for EVERY game it sells. Plus, assume ""new"" means the game is new to being available on Steam and not necessarily new as in made in 2014.I really hope this isn't a downhill spiral and that Steam gets back to how it used to be which made it essential to all PC gamers."

76561198057349017,Recommended,254080,29929659,Posted: 14 February,all,Sumomo-chan,"Let us clarify a couple of things first, mostly concerning the playerbase in regard of the current generation. Graphically, those players who never really tasted the look of games from 2001 and around (yes, a gamer's eyes do feel tastes) will mostly find this piece unpleasant, or even outright trash. Those who begun their gaming hobby or 'passing of free time with games' around then, might still find it great and fun to this day, unless they completely grew out of it. And I am sure that most of those who first faced pc games around the time of DOS and her sisters, will likely forever classify it an amazing corner of strategy gaming. With the discussion of graphics coming to an end (as highlighting these three groups of players among the hundreds of hybrid types of players revealed that this game can not be realiably up- or downvoted via the judgement of graphics), we should move on to the nice and those couple of nasty (but light-years away from fatal) points of the gameThere is a little thing that might have eluded the sight of a couple of people, the issue is only an issue in terms of tech lore, but on the other hand, it is sorta obviously there to strenghten the gameplay by allowing the players to be the sneaky types. There really isn't a simulation of night vision equipment, meaning that it is rather hard to detect vehicles and buildings if their lights are off, basicly you need to be close to them to spot them. On the other hand, as stated, it opens up a wider array of tactics, such as opportunities for ambushes, surprise attacks, and thus driving the players to utilise the use of radar equipment aviable in the game. While the AI is not really doing these sneaky things, players finding said AI a bit persistent and troublesome could even the odds with turning off the lights at night, as indeed, there is a day/night cycle, with additional transitional (dawn and sunset) visibility values as well. Then the vehicles, they all exist in real life, so they may be good of bad in different situations, such as armored or unarmored cars which hardly feel a difference when facing main battle tanks. Oh, and there is an interesting piece, the RAH-66 Commanche helicopter of the NATO, which is meant to be a stealth helicopter. However, you very soon end up finding out, that it is not so much more stealthy than any other helicopter of the game. But! Probably not many of the players are aware that this is exactly how the actual RAH-66 project turned out! A stealth helicopter which ended up being not so stealthy, and the game mirrors this fact well, thus some of the pieces of equipment here, even if not utilising night vision tactics, share the blunders with their real-life counterparts. Probably this is the reason for the Russian units relying on their own crew for repairs: they might not be the least fragile things, but they also are a less of a brain tumor to fix than those high-tier NATO vehicles. Then while the Russian and Iraqi soldiers are both willing to utilise any leftover equipment of the enemy against them, the US need no incompatible and somewhite less refined weaponry (only in the tutorial), thus they only capture buildings with their M113 apcs. The only sad thing here is that you cannot design the M113 model into carrying machine guns or anti-aircraft weapons, but you can vary other combat designs. Coming to anti-aircraft weaponry, just as in real life, they utterly limit your aerial operations until you wipe them out, prompting you to utilise combined warfare tactics, albeit turning off lights sometimes allow you to swarm these installations first, before they return fire usually pretty soon. And sure, aircraft disappear in a matter of seconds in great balls of fire, unless chaff system installed provides a couple of life-saving one to three seconds. And the AI that I mentioned, is goodBut enough of the technical stuff and gameplay, as Reality Pump did not just threw up an rts about war out of the blue, and a bit later I will highlight that there is even more, in fact much more than that (but probably many old players are aware of that by now). This will contain spoilers of course, and this is why I left this to the endSet between 2006 and 2008, most of the Earth's sources of fossil fuel are seemingly about to run out, at least those controlled by the Great Powers. The OPEC nations, who still seem to possess enough to keep it running for a while, decide it is best to conserve the fuel reserves. Iraq especially seems to probably nationalise the oil industry, and thus the G.I. Joe of the World who drinks oil for breakfast, the United States of America jumps into action. This time however, it will not go as smoothly as beforeThe first NATO campaign is centered around this new Gulf War, the invasion begins and after they effortlesly make landfall and star military operations, the Iraqi Army shows themselves and actually manages to cause a mass confusion, It is your task to undo this and revitalise the stuck offensive, to reach Baghdad and force an Iraqi surrenderMeanwhile, the Russian Federation resolves to invade Azerbaijan, just that it seems that organizations based in Iraq are supporting the Azeri as well. Starting at Shaki, you must eventually seize the Baku Oil Fields for the FederationIn Mexico, several cars and a truck are stolen and surprisingly, the News seem to be making a couple of correct guesses, and thus you must act quickly. This isn't a true Iraqi campaign, you play as a terrorist cell, which seeks to become a nuclear terrorist cell and strike US targets with their own nuclear arsenalAnd here picks up the second US campaign, where you need to take control of the situation and take back the silos before... you knowIn Iraq, you finally take up the sword as the Iraqi Army and with some jihadists helping out, you get the chance to free your homeland and destroy the US Fleet in the Persian Gulf. You also get a glimpse of the threat of the US satellite systemAnd now in Russia, shadowy men talk of a new revolution, a revolution that if succeeds might restore the glorious Soviet Union. The catch is: you are to lead itOne in the end might wonder about the intro cutscene. How despite of at least three atomic bombs going off in game lore (at least, since you can use tactical nukes ingame sometimes) this is a World War that dwarfed that of the previous World Wars? Just what really happened in the story that you failed to notice while playing? Is the destruction of DC, a US Fleet and an Iraqi desert region warrant for such a scale of loss? Well, didn't you feel like when those nukes went off, that the cost of victory begun to be ignored and thus the moralty of mankind started to go downhill? And that is what occured, in the game that you have played, here began the end of Earth.This story is just a catalist, in exactly 40 years after the story's end, the mayhem will begin anew, but this time the world will not stop at just three nukes. This is not just World War III - Black Gold, we can also call it 'Earth 2006'. The events that led up to an actual nuclear holocaust of 2048 begun here. First in about a decade or two, NASA will be known as the Lunar Corporation, and sometime after, the catastrophic conflict sweeps across the planet, and from its ruins will rise the Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States. This is the beginning of a new saga, the Earth Trilogy - which is in fact a Quadrology with this game/Search for 'Earth 2160 PC Games Trailer - Trailer.' on a search app, or look around on steam and you will see it all summed up and comfirmed, which will all make a sense if you played any of those games and cared to read the manual/With these things in mind, do I recommend this game? Absolutely for those who do not mind older graphics and sometimes challenging AI, and for those who loved the preceding Earth games, you absolutely do not want to miss this out of the collection! Because as I said, it all began here"
