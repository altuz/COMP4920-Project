If you're not already a billiards fan, Pool Nation won't make you one. Conversely, for those dying to scratch the billiards itch, Pool Nation is sure to satisfy. An entertaining, highly varied and technically excellent pool game, even if lacking in innovation or new elements for its genre.With Pool Nation you'll get a pooling experience that you've never had before. The simulator delivers several game modes and a lot of options to choose from. Every kind of shot that you can imagine is possible to make in the game and because of that you can truly speak of a great simulator. Another big plus are the graphics, which are truly stunning for a low budget title. Overall, Cherry Pop Games's first endeavour has left us with a fantastic billiards game featuring stunning visuals, great audio and even better physics. The lengthy, albeit difficult career mode, will give you plenty of play time but perhaps for the wrong reasons. If you're looking for a realistic, stylish, and fun billiards game, Pool Nation is the cream of the crop."

,Recommended,254440,8904627,"Posted: 29 January, 2014",all,Toxic League,"Pool Nation is a great pool simulator that will make you feel like a hustler once you master all the different trick shots. Lots of different game modes like 9-ball, 8-ball, endurance, and tournaments. Plus you can play online versus friends. The game offers good graphics, although they can be a little bit on the shiny side. The cue control system is mostly user friendly even though sometimes it can feel like a chore to set up a trick shot just right. Straight shots are extremely intuitive and the angle assistance makes it really easy to sink shots. Although bank shots and combos aren't so straightforward.This is the first real pool game that I have played on the PC and quite frankly I wouldn't be surprised if it was the last. I just don't know how it can get any better. The game trailers and screenshots really sold me before my purchase and the game certainly has not disappointed--really well done. The only blemish is that it occassionally crashes."

The developers are a small group working out of Manchester, England and they do a whale of a job listening to their players.  They frequent all of the forum and community hub sites and update when needed.  They really do care about their product and want to make it the best sim on the market and to my opinion they have succeeded.

A strange thing is the uncomfortable mouse controls, but i played with a xbox controller, what works very well.But now: Devs abandonned this game. They promised a snooker mode. There is none. They took ages to get the update for the trickshot mode which is basically a lure into buying dlc. This mode is also unpolished, as there was never an update again. And it should have been in the game for release. Well that's ok, i rather wait, than having an unfinished mode. Still no update or the promised snooker mode. Yeah bla bla small dev team...but:There is no reaction of the devs anymore in the forums. So they are planning on bringing a new game (which already is out on xbox) to pc, that is (at least in my opinion) what this game should have been and what we all paid for. But wait, it will cost you extra as it is a standalone game. The fact, that they promised the owners of this game an ""upgrade"" discount does not make it any better. So i say:Do NOT buy this!Such a dev team is not worth your hard earned money. And as there might be the ""real"" version of this game out, this is worth waiting for if you really want it.

It has an extensive career mode, free mode, fun challenges with unusual game types, tournaments, and online multi-player mode. Pool Nation is gorgeous - right down the the details in the fabric. The only negative in presentation is that your opponents are disembodied as are you; no physical presentation of the players in the game. There are also no spectators. You play in these gorgeous modern venues with seating for dozens or even hundreds, but they are entirely empty.As someone who has had a slate pool table in my home for most of my life, I find this a compelling simulation and well worth the few dollars of the asking price."

Fun single-player tournament mode. Game has a fair amount of complexity not offered in other similar games allowing players to pull off cool shots.CONS:Game has the tendency to occasionally glitch out. Planned features appear to be on an indefinite hiatus, and much-needed updates haven't happened. A bit tough to get a more advanced grasp on the controls. A lot of balls will fly off the table before you get a good feel for what will happen.WORTH:With how badly Pool Nation is beginning to fall apart and how sparingly things get addressed, I'd say wait for a sale. The developer has switched focus to other projects, so I wouldn't hold my breath for this version to come to full fruition.OVERALL:A fun game to share with friends, and it goes on sale for 1.00-2.00USD rather often.

,Recommended,254440,11225886,"Posted: 13 July, 2014",all,undox,"Right off the bat, one thing that will catch your attention is the variety of game types.  Most billiards games like to focus only on either 8- or 9-ball.  Those games are here, but they do not stop at that.  Along the game, other games like Rotation and Golf are in the mix.  With nine different ways currently available with Snooker and Trick coming soon, there are plenty of ways to play.Another strong point about the game is the controls.  Like in any other pool game, being able to control the cue ball is important.  Most games simply allow you to aim the ball and adjust the power.  Even though most games stop at this, there are more options to offer.  By being able to adjust the angle of the cue stick as well as where on the cue ball to aim, it gives the option of doing jump and swerve shots, something most billiard games leave out.  Additionally, with a full tutorial teaching how to do all of these moves, it does not take long before they become second nature.Beyond all the gameplay details, a nice touch about the game is the amount of customization available.  Even games that try to simulate pro billiards tend to stick to a single, sometimes sponsored look throughout the game.  This one goes beyond the basics.  As soon as you start a game, the highly detailed and moving locals make it feel like you are in what could be a real location.  As you keep progressing, at least a dozen locals, cue sticks, ball sets, and even table decals make it that regardless your taste, there is plenty to see even from a visual standpoint.Once the single-player game is over, there is still more to play.  Through online multiplayer, it is possible to keep playing with others.  It is even possible to create tournaments to learn who the best player is.  However, the one drawback is that there is no local multiplayer mode available.  This means that in order to play with another person in the same room, the two of you must play through a network.  This feels like a major oversight.  A simple hot seat patch would have made that the game could be a great party game.  Even without local multiplayer, this is still a great package that any billiards fan can easily enjoy."

,Recommended,254440,30063378,Posted: 20 February,all,Finnvbot,"TL;DRA solid arcadey pool game with a variety of modes. Despite the small playerbase and no previously promised snooker mode, I recommend it to anyfool panpool fan, especially on sale.+ User-friendly mechanics+ Gorgeous graphics and flashy gameplay (jump shots, swerve shots, etc.)+ A variety of gamemodes (honourable mention: endurance mode)+ Witty descriptions+ Fitting soundtrack+ Fair AI+ Lots of cues, decals, and ball sets- Small playerbase- No promised snooker mode- Minor bugsREVIEWPool Nation is an arcadey pool simulation game. This one takes the player to the world of fancy lounges, chillout music, and jump shots.The game is very accessible: tutorials are short but cover important basics to get one started. One can also adjust the aiming aid level (novice -> veteran -> pro -> champion -> off) which is a huge plus. Players can test their skills against the AI opponents in VS and Career modes, as well as against other people, and solo in the Endurance mode. The last mode is a time trial and requires quick thinking and precise shots, as the balls spawn faster as the time goes by and when the ball count on the table reaches 24, the game is over.The career mode is divided into two tournaments (9-ball and 8-ball), each with four cups. There are 12 matches in each cup plus a couple of bonus matches in lesser known modes, such as killer, 3-ball, speed pool, and the like. Each of the matches has two optional challenges to complete, for instance finishing a match with a skill shot, a ball streak, etc. Completing certain matches unlocks cosmetics. There are loads of decals, cues, and ball sets to be earned and the only problem is that they seem to reset to default ones every time the game is started. It is a minor issue but worth mentioning nonetheless.This game looks and sounds great. The sounds of cue action combined with jazzy muzaks in the background create a laid-back atmosphere. Sit back, take the weight off your shoulders, and pot the balls like a boss – this game lets one do just that. Furthermore, the AI is fair for the most part and the difficulty curve is not very steep, making the experience very pleasant and virtually rage-free.Overall, I recommend getting this game on sale to any fan of billiards games. While it may not be a realistic simulation and its playerbase may be really small, this game can provide hours of entertainment and satisfy the itch for some pool action. It indeed is a shame that the snooker mode was not delivered, given how much fun this game is.P.S.

The novice mode is only good for the first few rounds, as it reveals quite a bit of the ball paths. My only complaint here is that champion mode perhaps reveals too much as well (Cue ball only).Tricks shots are a blast to pull of and never get old.

,Recommended,254440,11906866,"Posted: 29 August, 2014",all,Mighty Joe,"Hey guys, thanks for reading my reviews. Let me make this as plain as possible. If you like pool and can find this cheap, check it out. It's not bad at all. I think the controls are better here in many ways than I've seen in previous PC pool games, but what's the game really like? You get nine ball, eight ball, and a few mini-games. There is a trick mode that hasn't been put into the game yet apparently. The humor is painful mostly, but not always bad. Just never very clever or subtle.As for the negative stuff: I think it gets repetitious. It's also buggy. I don't like the AI at all, as it sometimes seems too transparent what's happening in the game. Some of the rounds a really good AI player will goof several times in a row to give me a chance to beat it. Other times it feels like it's cheating to win.  Sometimes the match challenges don't appear to count properly or are too literally applied, and it seems inconsistant with its application of what meets the requirements of a given challenge. For example, I played a match that wanted me to get a 3 ball streak with a jump shot. I got a 4 ball streak with a jump at the end and it didn't count it. The next time I played, it seemed to count it. So I just don't trust the AI at all. Also, some of the designer ball sets that you can unlock confuse me visually because the stripes and solids look too similar to me from a distance. The settings are very colorful, which isn't necessarily bad, but can be VERY loud.Anyway, even though this seems a negative review, it's not meant to be. The devs say they are working to improve it, and if they do I think it has a lot of potential. As it is, if you can get it for a very low price and you like pool, try it. I've enjoyed playing it, but it can be frustrating at times."

It makes the grade in the areas critical to this type of game:  the physics are sound,the shot-making is clean, and there's enough variety in the game types to keep things fresh for a while.  On top of that, the game is downright beautiful.There are some flaws, but nothing game-breaking.  The most glaring (for me, anyway) was that the game feels literally empty.  When shooting, you're shooting in a seemingly deserted hall.  There's no crowd, no opponent squirming in the chair as you knock the balls down.  Speaking of your opponents, while their descriptions are modestly humorous, there's little to differentiate them from one to the next.  At times it feels a bit sterile.  Again, this isn't really game-breaking.  But part of the allure of playing at the bar or hall is the atmosphere, and the game is lacking in that regard.All in all, though, the plusses outweigh the minuses.

,Recommended,254440,10907039,"Posted: 28 June, 2014",all,McBaldwin's,"First off, this is the best looking pool game I have ever played.  Period.Beautiful pool tables, balls, and environments that are fully fleshed out and animated to give you a real sense of immersion.The game is full of details that kept surprising me.  Some of them are so subtle that you can't even notice it unless you are watching the replay.  Here are a few things you will find:* 3rd dimension: this isn't a simple pool game where balls stick to the table.  All pool balls can be knocked off, up in the air, and over other balls (given enough force).* When hit certain ways, chalk will fall off stick and sprinkle on the table.* Tiny woven texture on table material when you zoom in close* Sides of table (bumpers) actually give and bend in when a ball hits them with force (very hard to notice without replay!)For single player there is enough to keep you busy for awhile with tournaments in various game types against different AI.  One thing I found keeping my interest is bonuses you can try for on each game in a tournament.  For instance one might have a bonus for pulling off a jump shot during the match.  You can still win the game, but there will be a bonus for doing the jump shot.  Earning these stars while winning makes for a fun challenge.There are also many ball styles, cue sticks, and locations to unlock through single player.  So far every ball set I have unlocked has been great looking and is a good incentive to keep playing and unlock more.For multiplayer, it is fully functional in both same computer and online play.  Unsurprisingly you have to wait awhile for a game to show up, but that's less the fault of the game and more of the popularity of online pool :).Last I should go over the physics.  This is a tough point to argue because so many factors go into pool physics and without a doubt there is no game out there that is 100% accurate.  If you have ever seen a ball hit another ball at high speed in close up slow motion you'll see what I mean.  Not to mention there are many different ball sizes/weight, table materials and cue sticks used in different areas that add to the difficulty in comparing this to the real world.All I can say for sure is the physics seem real and have been really fun.  Added to the ability to hit the ball just where I want at power levels I never could in RL the game makes you feel like a pool master.Game is on sale for $1.99 currently.  Sell a couple summer trading cards and pick it up!"
,Recommended,254440,10247513,"Posted: 26 May, 2014",all,Flying Shisno,"The TL;DR: Amazing Pool game for both veterans and beginners. With many game modes(rule sets) and Free Play, local and online multiplayer, and several things to aid beginners, such as aim assist, an interactive tutorial to teach trick shots, and to always have the controls listed on the side of the screen. This, of course, can all be turned off.Great pool game! The main game modes in single player seem to be 8 and 9 Ball Tour Modes, where you play that ruleset against increasingly difficult AI opponents, who have humorous Bios. However they have other game modes/rule sets as Bonus Matches in the tour. Each opponent has 3 Stars you can collect as an added challenge, which can be completed for extra replayability. You get the first star simply by beating the opponent, which will also unlock the next opponent. The other 2 stars are gained by completing the objectives which are different for each opponent, then winning, since even if you complete the objectives, they won't count unless you win the match too. These Challenges range from doing specific trick shots, reaching a certain score, using no flashbacks(feature where you can redo a shot twice per match), etc. There is only one use for stars. Each of the Bonuses Matches are 'linked' to an opponent. When you beat that opponent, therefore getting 1 star, the next opponent is unlocked. However, to unlock the Bonuses Match linked to that opponent, you must have at least 2 stars, which includes the one you get for beating him.There are 2 Tour modes, each containing the same 4 competitions, each divided into 3 Rounds. Each competition is increasingly more difficult. In order of easiest to hardest: Sky Lounge Cup, Exchange Square Cup, West Coast Trophy, and Valley Lodge Masters. Initially you only have access to the Sky Lounge and Exchange Square Cup, but you can unlock them in order, starting from the Exchange Square Cup if you wish.Each Competition features a new area, and each Round features a version of that area at a different time of day. So Round 1 for the Sky Lounge During the Day, Round 2 for Evening, and Round 3 for night. Each time of day alters the look of the area to varying degrees, all of which look great. Beating a round will unlock that location/time to choose when creating a Versus or Online game.Now for the Bonus Matches I mentioned. In each Tour mode, there are various 'Bonus Matches' which deviate from the 8/9 Ball ruleset, which are Straight, Rotation, Killer, 3 Ball, etc. Completing the bonus match will award you a star, and also unlock a new graphic for either your Cue Stick, Table Decal, or Pool Ball skin. Bonus Matches are not necessary for advancing in the Tour.There is also a Versus game mode, which can be against a human player or against the AI. You start with one AI opponent on the easiest difficulty, and you unlock more by defeating them in the 8 and/or 9 Ball Tour. For a Human vs Human Versus game, it's a local multiplayer game, where you either share the keyboard and mouse, or 1 person uses the keyboard/mouse and the other uses a Controller. Theres many ways you can set up a Versus game: You can change the look of the Cue Stick, Pool Balls, and the Table Decal with skins/textures you've unlocked during the Tours Bonus Matches. You can change the ruleset, ranging from the classic 8 Ball and 9 Ball, to Straight Ball, Speed, Killer, Golf, 3 Ball, and Rotation rulesets. Online mode is basically the same, but with added ranked/unranked/custom options.In the main menu there's also ""Free Play"" mode. This give you the 9 Ball set up, but you can do anything you like. There's no human opponent, and you can consider it a practice mode, especially for practicing your trick shots. You can pick up the cue ball whenever you like and place it wherever you like. Once you pocket all the balls, it simply resets the table. I like to use this mode when I want to relax, practice trick shots, or just goof around and see how many balls I can send flying off the table in one shot. Pity you can't send it through a window. :pAlso in the main menu is Endurance mode. In this mode you need to make shots(also called 'potting' or 'pot') as fast as you can. New balls will constantly spawn, and when the active ball count on the table reaches 24, you lose, so you need to keep potting. After potting enough shots, you'll earn a brief period will the spawn rate will completely stop, giving you some breathing room.One thing that should definitely be mentioned, is the Aim System. There's various aim modes which will project not only where the Cue Ball will go, but the direction of the ball you're hitting. This is great for making not only regular shots, but making trick shots easy too. There's multiple levels of Aim projection, which will gradually decrease how far it will project the shot, then only show the cue ball's path, and finally no aim mode, where it won't even show the Cue Ball's path. This, combined Free Play, will help you become better and better.While we're on the subject of practicing, there's a Tutorial mode in the Single Player menu. This will teach you how to do various shots. From simple straight shots, to Jumping, Curving, Knife, Kick, Bank, etc shots. It's great for learning the various moves. There is an odd graphic bug/oversight. While the tutorial plays, it will always show the keyboard/mouse bindings at the top, but when it's your turn to try the shot, it'll show whatever control method you're using. It's not a big deal, since the controls are simple and there's even an option in the settings that will let you push the Help button, which is 'X' for controllers and 'K' for Keyboard, and will show all the controls at anytime and any game mode, so this game does great for helping beginners, but has the option of turning them off.You can save replays of your matches too, so you can view them again. Also works in Free Play mode. The replay feature isn't as fleshed out as it could have been, but it's okay.People have complained about controls, so I'll throw in my opinion: After playing it for a few hours with both the Xbox Controller and Keyboard, it does feel like it was intended to be played with the controller. HOWEVER, the keyboard and mouse controls are still great and nowhere near as bad as some have complained, and feel almost completely natural. I say 'almost' because I'm the type to keep my hand in a single position and dislike moving it too far. However, it's very easy to remap the keys closer, and honestly, only 2 or 3 keys I needed to move closer, and they weren't even necessary really. And in the Straight ruleset, the shot calling function was very awkward and overly sensitive for the keyboard/mouse. The replay modes keyboard/mouse controls are also awkward to use no matter how you map it.Anyway, to summarize: Great pool game, many game modes, online multiplayer, and great controls for BOTH the keyboard+mouse and controller. Most of the complaints on the keyboard controls are over exaggerated.Master Edit:Apparently there's a character limit to reviews, though I'm guessing it's rare for someone to waffle on enough to reach it. So yeah, I've edited this review over 6 times adding more info and correcting mistakes. Had to delete the other edits to make room for more waffle."

Full HD, good physics, nice gfx & sfx, local and also online mp wich is easy to access and uses steam functions like invite friend from friendlist. The difficulty in the standart setting for a experienced pool player is way to easy - you will feel like a billiardproof when having all the helping lines turn on. IF you turn off the helping lines or just set them to one of the 4 other presets like champion the game will become more like the real feeling because not every shot will be a putting. Different type of Billiard games makes it interesting to play again. And there is also a snooker mode announced wich i look forward too. Play this with a friend online or local is the most fun, but also the single player option serve some fun. For experienced and for newcomers this game is worth every penny. You can even train your real skills this way without killing some poolshops tables ^^. As some kind of bonus you can customize your tables , cues and also all the billiard balls."

It's not like there is at all any surprise.  You don't get surprised that Taco Bell serves tacos so why would you be surprised a game called Pool Nation is anything but pool?Overall I found it to be addictive fun.  When I bought it, the game was at I'd say a dollar and it was the best thing I've ever bought with only one dollar (NOT EVEN TAX!) I could have bought gum or soda with that $1 but that won't last me and is not as enjoyable as something you can share in an online session with.If you like or would want to learn about playing pool, this game is honestly the best (and only) pool game I know of.  The only con is that because it is for the computer, the gameplay takes some time to get used to (whether you use the keyboard or a controller).  However, the amount of time it takes you to learn how to play with buttons (versus using an actual pool stick) is time that you also gain experience and tips; so realistically you are not losing anything but gaining more than you pay for!  Being taught how to play a sport (that can be used for real life) is so worth paying only a dollar for.  McDonald's doesn't even have a dollar menu anymore; it's like $1.50.  Though I was fortunate at the time and the game is back to its' original price, the pirce is $9.99 (NOT EVEN $10!!) so it's not too bad a price.I SAY GET IT!!! But who am I to say?

Physics could be a teeny bit better, like the english (ball spin) physics. In real life, pockets on a pool table have angled cushions around the pocket to help your ball in, should you hit them correctly...In this game however, if you don't hit the ball straight into the pocket, it's not going in. If you hit the angled portion around the pocket, it will just reject your ball much of the time, really unforgiving but challenging. Hard to explain...think of a basketball hoop where if you didn't swish the ball, the ball would never go in.I don't use that aim assist or flashback bullcrap either. That's for sissies!Easy on the eyes and shiny as hell, though. I think the lighting on the balls (ha, balls) could be a lot better. Also, like the virtual pool series, it's a great game to play and mute all the in-game sound if you're in the mood to rock out to some of your mp3s, you can fully enjoy your music and the game at the same time.The game is still in development so I think it will improve over time.

The physics work well, the game is accessible for anyone to pick up and play while still having advanced shots for tricksters, and the online play works well.I use a keyboard and mouse for controls but I've been told by friends who use a 360 controller that it works fine there too.  The controls take a little getting used to and because of this I highly recommend playing through the tutorial.  It took me about an hour to get used to doing trick shots.  If trick shots are becoming too easy then I recommend turning up the difficulty on the aiming aid.There are a few other things I'd like to point out though it does not change my recommendation.First, some of the game modes like Golf aren't available in online play for some reason.  A few game modes such as Snooker or Cutthroat are not in the game either which is disappointing.  Snooker is being added in a future patch but at the time of this review it is not there.  Tournament mode doesn't seem to work either, I can't seem to get more than two people into a lobby.  An improved lobby system would be nice.  Allowing 3 people into a lobby would also be nice where one person can watch and then play the winner/loser or something or allows 3 players like Cutthroat.The replay system doesn't seem to work right either.  I haven't been able to save any replays because the controls on the system are not responsive or the binded keys are labeled incorrectly.Despite my minor complaints about the game, this is still a faithful recreation of billiards.  More updates are coming in the future and may fix/add the features I've mentioned.TL;DR version:  If you enjoy billiards, buy this game.EDIT:  As of the 1/8/2013 patch, the replay system works properly and the controls are responsive."

The control of the cue, the physics of the balls, and the plausibility of the shots either make me feel like I'm being guided through the game or is so uncomfortable playing that it's just not enjoyable.  Video billiards has always reminded my of video pinball in that there just isn't a video game that can capture the feel of playing.  While this game ""Pool Nation"" won't replace the actual feel of playing actual billiards... it's miles ahead of many billiards video game I've played that are out there.  The only comparable game is ""Virtual Pool 4"", which is a good simulation but ""Pool Nation"" graphics are a bit better and this game seems a little more reactive to your intent for playing.  In other words, this game ""Pool Nation""seems to be a bit more user friendly when trying to do what you want on the table than VP4 is.The game gives you excellent control of the cue that includes spin, english, angle, and power.  The controls are easy to learn but I highly recommend the tutorial in game to learn it.  It's short enough not to get boring and you need to learn the skills to play the game and the tutorial treats each lesson as a segment to complete and check off.  The ball physics are a good feel.  I can see myself lining up the shots and predicting the shots as I would on a regular billiard table.  Nothing's perfect of course but the devs did a good job here in my opinion.There are billiard circuits to play for single player and multiplayer.

If so, then Pool Nation is a game you might enjoy.Modes include free play (which lets you do whatever you want, recognizing no rules whatsoever), Eight Ball, and Nine Ball. The latter two are done in tournaments, where you face progressively more difficult opponents.Each opponent has bonus criteria, which when met, net you more points but also some opponents have extra modes. These extra modes include bonus games (with varying rules) to earn new Pool cues, felt table skins, and ball designs. None of these really matter as far as the game itself is concerned, but it's nice to get something extra when you do better than average.Sound and music are basic, although the music I found a little annoying. Take that with a grain of salt, as I often find music in games to be irritating. The sounds fit the game nicely, although they were nohing to write home about.Graphics are amazing. I grew up in a house with a real Pool table and except for a few angles here and there, the table and balls all look incredibly realistic. You can also view the game from your character's POV or use a top-down view. I'd strongly recommend the latter.The controls include mouse and keyboard or a controller. I used a wired Xbox 360 controller, as I found the analogue sticks to work better than relying on the digital input of the mouse or keyboard. Every once in a while it seemed like the game interpreted my stick movement as much weaker than I intended, but for the most part, it worked very well.One thing that makes this game much, much easier than real Pool is the inclusion of guides. These guides show you where the ball will go when you hit it and adjust on the fly when you change anything about your shot. Some people might see this as cheating, so on higher difficutly levels the guides are reduced or removed entirely.Multiplayer is available, although I have no idea how well it works. I've stuck entirely to single player against the AI. Considering the overall age of Pool Nation as well, there may not be many players left actively searching for games either.I will warn potential buyers that Pool Nation's developer seems to have abandoned the game. If I'm wrong about that, I apologize. To be fair, Pool Nation is 100% done, so there really isn't much more to do other than fix a bug or two if/when they pop up.Pool Nation is on sale a lot on Steam and through third-party stores, like Humble Bundle or Bundle Stars. so I'd suggest waiting for a sale to purchase it. That wait shouldn't be too long.All in all, I'd recommend this game. It's entertaining, relaxing (for the most part), and doesn't require in-depth knowlege of sports or quick reaction times."

Potting is so satisfying and once you start completing skillshots, it's enough to make a grown man make girlish squeals of pleasure.Pros- Very easy to ""pick up & play"" the tutorials are well done, but are OPTIONAL, so you can do them whenever you feel like, if at all and repeatable, so you can brush up on certain types of shots if you are having difficulty.- All of the things that make this more game than simulation can be turned off or not used. Those who want a challenge don't have to have aiming lines or use flashbacks.- Loads of unlockable customisation options, unlike certain simulators where to get a new table or cues (or trains or pinballs) you have to get your wallet out, 95+% of the customisation options are unlockable by beating different challenges or tours.- Each match in a tour comes with 2 challenges that require you to win the match in certain ways, such as using a particular shot or getting a high score, etc, giving completionists more to achieve.- Scrolling the mouse back & forth to control the cue is enjoyable- The graphics are amazing. Bearing in mind i'm playing this on a laptop, it looks beautiful. I would go as far as saying this is the best looking game i've run on this, with no framerate drops.Cons- The menu can occasionally get fiddly.- Sometimes, when trying to aim the cue with the middle-mouse-button, the camera pans up instead.- Extremely rare crashes. Had 2 so far, but i'm unsure if that's something to do with my hardware to be honest.Seriously, just look through the rest of the reviews. There are HUNDREDS of reviews, all positive, some are casual players, some are hardcore simulation players, all of them love it. Even when this game isn't on sale, it is totally worth the full asking price. If you're even slightly interested in this game, pick it up, you won't be disappointed."

In no time, you will be preforming curve and jump shots. This game has everything an avid pool player would look for. I can see myself playing this game for years to come without the need to find a better game. I love 8 ball, 9 ball and straight pool. I am not into the other billiards games like Snooker, Carrom or Crokinole so this game is ideal for me. I like the fact that you have bonus achievements to try and accomplish during each match to obtain a 3-star winning. It’s not just point and shoot over and over.

Pool Nation is a billiards game, that's it. It's a slick-looking multiplayer/singleplayer campain billiards game.And it's fun as hell.Weirdly enough, I'm comparing this to Sniper Elite V2. While the two games' topics are in no way similar, both play out in coincidentaly similar ways. For example, both Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2 hav slick, shiny graphics that look AMAZING. The graphics on both games look professionally made and I just love it. Graphics haven't been a huge thing for me, but wow, Pool Nation's graphics are actually better that Call of Duty Ghosts, and to top it off, my computer can run it.Another weird similarity is the ""killcams"". In Sniper Elite V2, if you hit the enemy in a certain place, the camera pans out to the bullet or the enemy, and you get to watch the enemy get shot up close. In Pool Nation, if you make a Skill Shot or just a nice looking shot, the camera sets up on the hole, and you watch the ball fly in. The only difference is, Pool Nation does this less. For me, almost every shot in Sniper Elite was a killcam, and it got annoying as hell (except the ball shots). But the killcams only happen periodically in Pool Nation, and THANK YOU SO MUCH for doing so.And the last thing, if you think about it just a tad, playing pool is almost like sniping. You have to aim carefully at a specifis target (and in some cases many targets) and shoot. Not only to you target all if the solid or striped balls in pool, but you also aim at a certain hole and shoot! How weird is that?So now you know why I compared Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2. Pretty good comparision if you ask me, but overall I think Pool Nation is worth your money. It's an amazing pool game, but its not Steam's only pool game.Buy it and hit me up."

Essentially, that's pretty much what I got! At first, I wasn't sure if I liked the ""feel"" of it as much, but once I'd played a good few games, I find I do like it a lot! The only bad things I have to say about it (and it's not even that bad) is that there is a slight difference in the movement of the cue stick between single player, and multiplayer. I'm not sure if it's just my pc or not, but for me, single player feels very 1:1 in terms of how much I expect the cue stick to move in relation to how much (and quickly) I move the mouse. In multiplayer for me, it feels like there is a very very slight delay between me moving the mouse, and it moving the cue. When I say very very slight, I really mean it. It's easily the kind of thing you can get used to, and after playing several games, I barely even notice it myself, unless I actually jump from playing single player, straight in to an online game.The only other disappointing thing, is that it doesn't have Snooker. If it did, this would be the penultimate pool game! Certainly not a deal breaker though! If you like pool games, or are a fan of the Virtual Pool series, you won't regret purchasing this at all. I've played many many games online with a friend of mine (usually several matches a day!) and we both get great enjoyment from doing so! As you can see from my playtime, I've already spent a significant amount of time playing this, and it's only going to grow further!Trick shots are hard to master, but once you get your head around how to do jump shots and curve shots, whole new ways of playing become apparent, and you truly start to feel like a master!The single player is challenging and fun, and having mini goals in each round keeps you coming back for more, since usually completing those goals, leads to unlocking new locations, balls, decals and cues.At it's current price of $1.49, you'd be crazy not to grab a copy! I think I payed $3 or $5 for it at the time of purchase, but I would say that even if it was $10-$15, it's still worth every cent!"

I have not tried the trick shots much so I can not speak about those but if you just want to play some decent 8 or 9 ball, get this. It sells pretty cheap too.

I regularly had an issue where stars in levels would not be awarded after the match when the in-match tracking said I had completed the challange and I had won both the game and match. This lead to completing stars up to four times before the game successfully registered them. Another frustrating but not game breaking issue was that the overhead view became blocked on some levels which left me with only the on table view. This view is enough to play on, but still limited my options. A lot of little things like this detracted from the game for me and lead to me sending it to the done pile earlier than it should have been.

The sound design is fantastic, the graphics are shiny but non-intrusive, I haven't seen a single physics error. If you want to simulate a game of pool, this will do it almost to a tee.However. I have three reservations.The power meter gets stuck sometimes if the mouse is accidentally pulled to the edge of the window, even on fullscreen. This can cause some dodgy shots.The Endurance challenge instruction page seems to be bugged and will only let you see the last page of it. To be fair, the gist of the 6 page manual is that you need to pot balls fast, but it's not entirely apparent what parameters there are on this activity.The Straight challenge does not account for trick shots or indirect aiming the same way that the rest of the game is, and this is never explained. As such, and as the name might suggest, you should only shoot straight. No jumping, no swerving, don't even think about a combo.Aside from that, a very robust and well designed pool game."

In other words, it looks and feels great, no cornyness of crappy imaging, animations or things that make you go ""huh?""There is no such thing as being snookered on this game.The only downside is the boring game music, but this isn't a game where you need to hear whats going on, so turn it down n get the tunes on.The best side, trick shot (in closed beta right now) to be released for free when done. (its a trickshot editor)"

,Recommended,254440,8202512,"Posted: 22 December, 2013",all,Weasel,"I'm not afraid to admit: I bought Pool Nation solely on account of its graphics.Let me elaborate. One of my favorite ""sports"" games (let's not get into the semantics of whether pool is a sport) of all time has been the original Virtual Pool by Celeris. Since it's been literally years since I played the game, Pool Nation struck all the right chords with me: low price (on sale for $5), great artwork and graphics (ooh, shiny!), and those pangs of nostalgia that I'd been craving.Pool Nation sports a reasonably good tutorial mode and even teaches you how to pull off expert moves like jump shots, knife-edges, and all sorts of careful maneuvers with curving and banking. And those moves will generally score you loads of style points (which, as far as I can tell, are only useful on the in-game leaderboards - there's no way to spend them, and all the unlockables come from milestones in the Tournament modes).If I have only one complaint about Pool Nation, it's that the AI suffers from what I like to refer to as ""Worms Syndrome""; in short, the AI will alternate between being a complete and utter stooge (like pocketing the cueball) and being freakishly perfect at their shots (I've seen even low-tier opponents like Cousin Merl pull off insane curving bank shots and manage to pot two or more balls in one hit, on occasion).Of course, this ceases to matter if your intention is playing with friends. This is also a bit of a problem, though, as the online scene for Pool Nation is...well, pretty much nonexistant. You'll pretty much need to talk your friends into buying it if you want to play against anybody other than the AI opponents (or the timer in Endurance Mode). This said, though, given the game's low price, that shouldn't be too hard.And then, yes, there's the graphics. Everything in this game is really shiny. Not ""bloom and HDR"" shiny, but nice and reflective and smooth. The pool halls you compete in (there are several!) are lovingly rendered and actually remind me of the city from Mirror's Edge. Then there's the character artwork, which is occasionally hilarious (Cousin Merl and Beef Chillingham both elicited chuckles from my usual Livestream audience).So, yes, I give Pool Nation my recommendation. There are no crazy arcade elements (you won't see explosions or fancy particle effects); it's pretty much straight pool with a nice coat of gloss and some solid physics."

It is frustrating and distracting and something I didn't expect to see this side of glitchy Windows XP games. It's like half of the game was designed around a controller and the other half was made for keyboard and mouse.I'm sure there is a bit of a gem buried in here if I dig long enough but it just doesn't seem worth the effort.On the plus side you can totally cheat using a straight edge on your monitor to line up your shots, if you cared enough.Bought on sale for $1.49.12-28-14 edit: Achievements are working again."

Which of ocurse doesnt mean that it transfers over immeditally but aftwer a half a dozen games of pool in real life, I found myself using stuff I learned here to beat my friends quite decidely.If that isn't a good sales pitch for a game I bought to just have fun with on slow nights that I can't play for long perioods of time due to school work, what else will?Oh and it's HUGE! I've played about 3.5 hours thus far and have barely scratche (no pun intended) the surface of what this game offers to those willing to play it! Pretty grateful they made it too, super relazing rarely fustrating but not cheap by any means, this is a serious Pool Table simulater and the computer will make ""human choices"" but when you do play it and it knows what its doing watch out, for those worried about it though one you learn how to play it well you realize that you could've done just as well if you hadn't tried to push your luck with that last big trick shot.

The right joystick on a 360 pad is used to not only select shot power (pulling back the stick), but also to execute a shot (pushing up on the stick).  With all the strategy that goes into each shot, it's too easy to accidentally execute a shot in this manner.  Worse still, it is possible to push up on the stick with no options set, executing a medium power shot with no options set (power, stick angle, ball spin).  In the options, I could see where to remap some things, but not this.  I really want shot execute to be a button, not a stick that I can bump...otherwise, fantastic game, great price!

We use 2 Steam Controllers and play via my Steam Link.This is a fun little pool game that is great for players of all skill levels.  The controls are very intuitive and have been easily picked up by my 75 year old father and others.   We all like the music and find it contributes nicely to the overall relaxing nature of 2 player pool.One of the great features is the versatile aiming aid which shows players the exact path of the cue ball and object ball as they aim and adjust spin and power.  As players get better they can shorten the length of the aid to increase the player skill required to make the shots.  In 2 player local co-op each player may choose the length of the aiming aid independent of the other player.  This means experts can have a very short aiming aid while less-experienced players may have a longer one.  This is a nifty way to handicap games that doesn't make new players feel pandered-to in my experience.A couple of negatives are that the physics are a bit questionable at times, and the aiming aid can permit some absolutely ludicrous shots that would be impossible outside of a physics simulation.  The single player career seems to be nothing more than a way to purposefully gate content... even though you bought the game if you want all the locations and wingdings unlocked you have to buy the ""unlock"" DLC or slog through the laborious and completely unfun ""career"".All in all, I recommend this game for local co-op play and pretty much no other reason.

It really is quite impressive, you can pull off just about any shot you can imagine if you have the know how. The AI players start off easy enough for you to get used to the control scheme (which isn't actually that intuitive, but once you get used to it, it's pretty damn good) and the game in general, and they range up to players so hard that if you give them an opportunity, they will clear almost any table. For some, that may be off putting, but it's not too far from reality, a lot of top players will clear almost any table if theyre having a good day.Only issue i have really is that after a while, it gets kinda dull. Caning each AI player one after the other gets too easy after a while, and the only way to lose is to try and get 3 stars for the 3 challenges per match, but providing they don't ask you to do something that actually requires any thought, like a bank or kick shot, you have no excuse not to get all 3 stars.They also try and spice it up with bonus matches of different disciplines of pool, which again is cool for a while, I still haven't mastered them all.I don't really know what to suggest to make it better, it's pretty much as good as I can imagine a pool game getting, barring adding some kind of trick shot challenge, but then again, you may aswell make all shots a trick shot once you're used to the game.8/10 - A very good time killer"

,Recommended,254440,9012964,"Posted: 7 February, 2014",all,623alterego,"For Steam's Only (current) Pool Game, Pool Nation sets a high bar for any Billiard-themed game that wants to show up on Steam. The physics for this game are top notch with the ability to perform jump, swerve, bounce and multiball trick shots are but a minute's time and a precice accurate eye, away. And there is nothing more relaxing to me than taking time to set off the perfect shot, and rub it in the Computer's proverbial face.Positives: The Graphics are AMAZING. (I know what you are thinking: ""How The [Expletive] could a Pool game have good graphics?!"") Well, to put it this way, imagine the shiniest piece of metal to ever grace your eyes. A shine so great you could literally ogle at your perfect image in its reflections. That is how the game looks. It's that good.Negatives: With great graphics, comes great disk space. The ammount of data that was put into making this game look and feel soo good, creates alot of memory. The size of this game is atleast 5x the expected size of what someone would think a Pool game would be, numbers-wise. It is pretty damn big for a 'simple' Pool Game.Grey Areas: The AI. I like to compare the AI in this game slightly similar to the AI in Worms Revolution. How? They both are perfectly accurate when they try, but when they mess up, they mess up HARD. The nicer part about the AI in Pool Nation, though, is that the AI will give you a large break when you first start to play. And the chances of your Computer Counterpart getting a perfect 8 ball streak win against you is almost impossible. But rest assured, there will be no mercy if you can't learn to pocket well.But after touching upon all these needed areas, Pool Nation is definately a must have for cheap, simple, yet enjoyable for many-a-time-gaming. Overall Ranking of games I've played: (9/10 because Left 4 Dead 2 & Kingdom Hearts still have my ties for 10/10 of all time)."

There is much of content for singleplayer - u can play classsic 8 or 9 ball tournaments with decent ammount of unlockables - as u progress in singleplayer, u'll unlock more cue designs, ball sets and table decals . Pool Nation also gives u an option to choose the aiming aid - novice and  veteran is very easy and arcade, so if u are looking for more challenge, try pro, champion or ""off"" mode. Physics is pretty awesome, graphics is great, you can perform many trick shots, jumps, swerve, bank and kick shots, you can test how fast u are in endurance and speed modes.Pros:- best pool, not just on steam- very nice graphics, great physics, very fast loading- nice singleplayer campaign- online mode where you can challenge your friends and other players- nice price for well made pool game, but i hope that more content will be aded for free, because price for PS3 version + DLC with 100 decals, 12 locations, 16 cues and 12 Ball sets is only 6$ (basic game costs 4.50$ + pack 1.50$) .)Cons:- leaderboards are still messed up, so u can see many ""fake"" scores - this seems to be caused by some glitch or bug, but it definitely looks bad .)"

It's got 8-ball, 9-ball, Straight pool, 3 Ball, Rotation, Speed pool and they're going to add more.The AI seems kinda bland, like all the AI opponents are just ""I'll take 3 good shots and then screw up on purpose"".  The opponents don't talk to you, and heck, you don't even see them walk around the table or anything.  I feel like they could have gone that extra mile to make the opponents in game seem more lively or personable.There's also options for various kinds of customizations.  You have table decals (which range from the mildly distracting to the highly annoying), and decorative balls (all of which are EXTREMELY SHINY!).  You can even customize your pool cue though you'll barely notice that in game.  Finally you can change your game location from a huge room with a view, to a huge room with a view at night, and then to another room without that great of a view...  Again, I feel like they could have made the locations a bit more interesting instead of looking like you're inside a museum.There's an upcoming ""Trick shot"" mode which may be amusing to play around with, and also snooker is promised as DLC (whether that's worth the extra price or not remains to be seen).The music is a bit too ""jazzy"" or ""technoish"" for my tastes but you can turn the volume down.  It would be nice if each location had its own soundtrack (to add more personality to each place) but that could be asking for too much.  It would also be nice if you could tell the game your music folder location and let it play songs from that randomly.All in all though, this is worth the full price, and if it's on sale, buy it now...

The 3 in-match challenges per foe make for a difficult task to those looking at getting every unlock and 100% completion... I like this sort of challenge.Graphically its very smooth with a good use of ambient lighting and color contrast. Theres something of a futuristic style about the in-game themes and pool halls.Another feature I love about this game is the use of trickshots, it can seem alittle exaggerated at times but its always fun to see one played well, or even better playing a beaut yourself. Trick shots without guidelines are where champions leave their mark.As others have said pool nation is a very relaxing experience if you allow it to be, as it's accompanied with a charming soundtrack, sweet visuals and spot on sound effects. It's easy to slump and play...Lastly, the online is where I find the real buzz in pool nation. The community seems friendly so far, though sadly its small in number I believe. (You should join us)For me 5 frames, 8 ball pool, without guide lines is the most enjoyable and of course the most testing in every sense of the word to play online, but its brilliant.9.5/10 - It delivers everything you'd want for this genre"

While the physics model was spot on and such, I really wasn't worrying about that so much. I just... Played it. It felt great! The AI doesn't exactly feel like they're bringing their absolute A-game, especially with the higher stage opponents. Maybe I configured it wrong. I didn't actually need to configure the game honestly, which, while welcoming, kind of makes me wonder if I should have.At the time of purchase this game was just $1. Would it be worth the full price? Yes. There's quite a bit of game, so the price was already justified, but there's also quite a bit of challenge that you're probably gonna want to slog back to. The game comes with online, workshop, and some extra challenges.Sadly, not many people I know own this game. IF you do buy, suggestion is that you get a copy for your good mate and maybe shoot some over a Skype call or whatever.Furthermore, you can screw around with a table by yourself. That's rad."

And lastly this is just a pet peeve due to the fact that video game based pool games always lack a degree of visual depth so you kind of need an aim marker for precise shots which in real life pool you can make just with your own judgement/imagination and this one while highly decent lacks the key feature of projecting a line for each ball struck and instead focuses on the cue and the first ball it hits.In short for a pool game it's good for what it is, I'd say a 7/10 and if you enjoy pool and want a game that does a fairly good job of simulating it then this is a definite must while on sale, though honestly I'd never pay more than $5 for it."

A little let down by it's console heritage, so the UI is a little clunky at times, but the gameplay itself is superb and the physics feel right. Difficulty progression is very smooth so no sudden jumps from beatable to unbeatable opponents. There are several versions of pool available to play to keep it from getting dull, although sadly no options to tweak the rules to match more local varieties of the game. All in all though, I thoroughly recommend this game. :)"

I've played a -lot- of PC (and console) pool games over the years, and this probably is the best one I know of.But! It does have a few quirks. Mainly, it was made to be played with a controller. It can be played with mouse/keyboard but it's a bit clunky. Kind of hard to line up your shot even when you know exactly what you want. I've tried it with a controller and it seems to be much more suited for that, so use one of those if you have one.There are a few other little problems. Most of them are in the UI. It's just not made for someone to navigate it using a mouse. They have released a couple of updates since I last played the game, though, and apparently they have fixed some of the UI problems. I'm eager to go play it again after writing this.All that said, the actual gameplay/physics/etc is phenomenal. That's why it's the best pool game out there.It's well worth $10 dollars, and I would say it'd even be worth the triple-A standard price of $60 without some of the UI problems.As of the time that I'm writing this, it's 70% off ($3) and it's a steal at that price, so go buy it!If you love pool, that is. I certainly do, and would love to play some multiplayer with anyone willing."

With that said it is a fairly competent Billards game for being a Billards game. It's showing you what will happen lines in many cases make it a touch bit easy, though the lines should be there, maybe not as far out as they go after the cue hits the first ball or rail. With that said the pyhsics in the game seem good, you can actually do some pretty neat trick shots if you know what your doing.All in all, unless your really into Billards you will not find $10 of value here, its a good game to pick up if you like billards with fairly realistic physics when it is on sale, but I can not recommend it for people who only like Billards at full price, not because the game is bad in anyway but because well a video game version of pool no matter how good it is is still a somewhat niche market. So if you find it on sale and can pick it up for $3-5, even if you only like pool I would say its worth it. If your really into pool, then even $10 is worth it, but don't come expecting anything other then a competent pool game with good physics because apart from unlocking new table skins, ball skins, and stick skins its ""tournaments"" might as well just be single match games because even if you loose to someone you can just retry them.Just as a warning I did have the game crash on me once when doing a trick shot, so it may not be fully stable, but enjoyable Billard game non the less."

There's a great training mode too, so even anyone who has never played pool before can pull off trick shots like a master.

Because if you like pool-gamesyou'll have to buy a waterproof computeryou really should care about it!Visually it's quite the looker... I'm not gonna go into the whole ""shiny balls"" discussion, but it is a good looking game. The physics are also spot on, and you can have a little bit more of finesse in your shots in comparison to most free web-based pool-games. There are a handful of game modes including your classics like 8ball and 9ball. The only thing missing is snooker, which isn't a pool-game by itself but it would've been fun to have it included.The single player campaign is fun with ""missions"" for every match that'll give you bonuses and unlocks if you manage to achieve them. Also, of course, there's online multiplayer.The only negative thing I can come to think of is that the port (it was originally released on console) didn't really manage to get the ""select ball and pocket""-mechanic to work with a mouse-and-keyboard-setup which feels kinda strange since it should be easier with a mouse than with a controller. You'll get past that but at first it gets really frustrating if you want to pocket the ball in another pocket than what the game assumes.With that said there's just one question you need to ask yourself; do I want to play pool on my computer? If the answer is ""yes"" then Pool Nation is the game for you. If the answer is ""no""... go get that waterproof PC."

(not sure what to call it) mode and it feels great to play in, like you're really at a pool table playing.They even have slow-mo cams that zoom in to the ball when you've shot one in(only happens once in a while so it's not annoying and you can skip it if you want by pressing the button for skipping; you can even choose to skip the turns the npc takes when you want to play against them).Singleplayer has different modes,and you can play against npcs in several types of games (while sometimes unlocking different designs for the cue, ball, or the table as rewards for certain things).There's 'free mode' where you can just play by yourself without a limit (if you just want to shoot while relaxing or try out certain moves).There's also an endurance mode, which is like free mode (the by yourself without npc aspect), but is timed or rather the goal is to shoot as many balls in as you can, as fast and accurate as you can before too many extra balls get added to the table.And they have a tutorial mode where you can learn how to play and learn advanced tricks.You can turn the guiding 'lines' completely off, for people who want to play real-world style;they're just like training wheels and you can choose to use them or not,and you can also choose to have the lines, but have different types, if you want.The npcs aren't perfect shots, but they're not terrible either,and sometimes they'll miss after perfectly shooting 4-ball in a row or something, for example;it's a bit random, kinda like a real person might miss, even if they're good.There's plenty of content to play,challenges in the game that unlock bonus rounds, new areas and npc characters,or reward you with a design for the cue, ball, or table, that you can use to play with.And of course there's still the steam achievements.Or you can try to master the advanced tricks from the tutorial and try them in free mode and then later against npcs.You can also repeat maps you've played already (when you unlock something it gets unlocked for permanent use).Some games I regret buying, but this is definitely not one of them.If you like pool games, this is a nice one to have"
