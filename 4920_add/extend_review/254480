I loved it on the PS2 when I was 15, and I love it now. That said, if you cannot stomach bad voice acting, this might not be for you. It ping pongs back and forth between being quite good and laughably awful, but when given a chance it has some very tense moments, and the port is, in my opinion, a very good one all things considered. There is the issue that the game is not in widescreen, but it also wasn't on my PS2 so I am not terribly concerned with it. More important to me was the controller support, which thank god was added. There are also some token achievements for those who like that sort of thing, so overall, I am impressed. Overall, if you like cheap horror or old school survival horror, download this little cheap game and have a few hours of fun with it."

76561198048974498,Recommended,254480,11152980,"Posted: 9 July, 2014",all,rjmacready,"Combine a storyline more loopy and incoherent than almost every Japanese anime ever made, a cumbersome real-time item-choosing system guaranteed to make you use those medkits even faster, a save system which ensures you'll have to waste countless minutes at a time getting back to the bit which killed you in the first place, the occasional obstructive ""camera angle"" almost deliberately designed to ♥♥♥♥ you six-ways-to-Sunday, and some of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest boss fights in all of video game history...and what do you have?Well, oddly enough, a mostly enjoyable and worthwhile gaming experience...but ONLY if you've already played several dozen other post-Resident Evil third-person ""survival horror"" games, and are so addicted to such curiosities that you'll endure almost any level of punishment in search of that next elusive ""fix"".I recently played and wrote a review of the first Obscure in which I declared it a ""pleasant surprise"", or words to roughly that effect. Given that I had slightly higher expectations of this one in the wake of its more-than-serviceable predecessor, I wouldn't say that I'm ""disappointed"" so much as a little bewildered at just how nutty and, well, borderline incompetent this one so often gets.Don't get me wrong: there's a lot of REALLY GOOD IDEAS here. One improvement it arguably makes over the original are the very distinct ""special abilities"" which each character has, all of which you will at some point REQUIRE to make progress through the game (as opposed to the ""vaguely-useful-but-mostly-inessential"" abilities evidenced by most of the characters in Obscure 1). To this effect, much of the puzzle-solving in this game is actually quite clever (though asking the player to pick a tricky lock puzzle in the midst of the climactic boss fight while a monster clobbers you from the side was perhaps pushing the friendship a little)! And the learning curve applied to these mini game-within-a-games is mostly realistic and achievable, even for a certifiable doofus such as I.The scenery is also frequently interesting and varied. Perhaps a little TOO varied for realistic geography purposes, but never mind (just think of it like one of those epic sword-and-sorcery fantasy worlds where a blazingly hot desert and an icy wasteland are just a hop, skip and a jump away from each other...apparently suburban high schools and spooky, near-desolate islands inhabited by in-bred Texas Chainsaw rejects do much the same thing).It's also a game with lots of ""personality"", not least of all within the characters themselves. Plenty of entertaining banter and carry-on whilst the gameplay continues unabated, giving it a convincingly ""cinematic"" feel and making you actually ""care"" a little more for the fate of said characters than your average paper cut-out video game personas (off the top of my head, the Walking Dead and Left 4 Dead games are about the only other horror titles so earnestly devoted to giving their protagonists more than two dimensions).Look, it's pretty clear by now that I have a certain fondness for these games, even if this one in particular infuriated me almost to the point of electronic pulpification. Mostly I'm just relieved there was never an Obscure 3, 'cause you know that I'd feel obliged to play it, and judging by the quality arc this series has evidenced thus far, it would probably be almost intolerably ""bad"". ALMOST.In the tradition of the best ""trashy"" horror films, let's just chalk this one up as a ""guilty pleasure""...even if the ""pleasure"" parts only seem to come in spurts.Verdict: 8/10."

As a fan of the first game, I disliked the first half of the story, but it gains so much on the second half that, for me, this game is as good as the original. The steam version runs fine, no bugs, decent controls, some little issues with the camera, but nothing too serious. If you like the first Obscure, get the second one. You will regret nothing."
,Recommended,254480,15044538,"Posted: 25 March, 2015",all,CheekyChan,"It's hard to decide where to start with this one. But I'll start by saying that Obscure: The Aftermath was one hell of a good game and deserves a lot more than the 59 rating it received on Metacritic. This is truly a unique game that has never really been done before. A mix of Resident Evil and Silent Hill with a combat system that isn't♥♥♥♥♥ (Not saying RE and SH's combat systems are♥♥♥♥♥but it's not fluid and it's just tricky mostly, coming from a huge fan of both series.). Obscure gives you a mix of a good combat system that's fluid and like a classic survival horror having to stop to reload or swing your melee weapon and pretty good co-op gameplay, one of the only true survival horror games that has co-op and it was indeed creepy, co-op doesn't make a game less scary.Pros:+Good looking for it's age, not super dated.+Great co-op and gameplay mechanics/puzzles, not too hard, not too simple.+Intriguing story that you'll want to know more about and hope for a third game, likable characters although they are pretty cliche. Stoner, techie, vixen, jock, comedian and goth.+Nice control scheme, X360 controller support with button prompts and vibration.+Practical Achievements.+Mostly bug free and stable.+Creature designs.+Fun boss fights.+Just the perfect difficulty.Cons:-Voice acting is hit and miss.-Pre-rendered cutscenes are pretty badly lip synced at times or are in general not very good looking and often times in-game cutscenes are better.-No widescreen support at all, resolution options are there but the game is letterboxed at 4:3 with side borders.-Camera can sometimes be weird, though in co-op each player can focus the camera on themselves hitting the right trigger in case they get stuck on a creature or need to have each player in a different location.-Some bosses can continuously hit you if you get smacked into the perfect position and some boss fights have un-dodgeable moves, no warm-up animations or signs they'll be using their OP move that can't be dodged but most boss fights aren't super difficult.Other Thoughts:Now I know you must be thinking: ""Wow, that's a lot of cons...sounds like a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥.."" well the positives outweigh the cons by a huge margin and honestly the camera isn't that bad and the lip-syncing/hit and miss VA work is understandable for a French indie developer title that released on multiple platforms in 2007, honestly the most annoying aspect of this game is the lack of widescreen support that was available on the PSP version which I had but didn't get the chance to play.I'd highly recommend this game, specially for someone who just wants a creepy game in general with a good story or someone looking for GOOD scary co-op fun. That game is pretty short but felt almost perfect in length for me and you may need to play it twice to unlock all achievements, I missed one small key so I'll probably blow back through it again.I did not play the original one all the way through, only the very beginning, but I will definitely pick it up when I feel like."
,Recommended,254480,17888353,"Posted: 4 September, 2015",all,Lintire,"Obscure 2 is an extremely stupid game.This 2007 horror game by Hydravision Entertainment (now Mighty Rocket Studio) is a direct sequel to the 2004 survival game of the same name. Obscure 2 is not a love-letter to b-list horror titles, it is a b-list horror title.Important to note that Obscure 2 is compatible with both Xbox and Dualshock. Like the previous game, I'd strongly recommend using one.Sequels are a tricky affair in any situation. For all the cries of innovation, a certain degree of iteration is expected of any game with the same name slapped on it - a lesson Mighty Rocket Studio learned when they attempted to reboot Obscure and ended up pressured into renaming it ""Final Exam"". Obscure 2 is so heavily intertwined with the original that it's impossible to review it without heavy comparison.There's heavy improvements - most notably, from the getgo, melee is not only tolerable but almost fun. Devil May Cry isn't in danger of being displaced from the top of the food chain, but hitting enemies with the weapons the game throws at you is no longer a nightmare in itself. The characters swinging the bats have received similar improvement.At the cost of the ""anyone can die"" gimmick, characters now have variety, depth, story arcs, and dialogue, and aren't just completely interchangeable and forgettable. I almost got attached to some of the new and returning characters during the calmer moments where duos would banter. Calmer moments that are also heavily improved - the puzzles, from the minigames to the environmental work - is leagues ahead of Obscure's, despite the new action focus.On top of all this, it looks better - character models are respectable and environments much more detailed and interactive (with an insane amount of flavour text in select areas). None of which disguises the hilariously bad plot.Obscure 2's plot is full of holes, contrivances, retcons, arbitrary character shifts and terrifying CGs nestled comfortably in the pit of the Uncanny Valley. Even if not compared to the first game's flimsy pretext, Obscure 2's plot goes to insane and hilarious over-the-top places, while remaining completely straight-faced, even retroactively turning Obscure's plot into a land of stupidity. And you know none of it is ironic, because the developers are French. It is a joy on every level.But this came at a heavy cost.The beautiful level design  that intertwined with pleasing complexity is axed in favour of a completely linear game to almost corridor levels. The slowly filled-in maps are gone, along with maps altogether. The haunting camera angles are gone. The suspense-laden pacing is gone. The flashlight mechanics are gone. The atmosphere is completely brutalized and thrown out the window in favour of an action game with action pacing.That's without mentioning that co-op is now mandatory - and while the AI is no longer borderline useless, you now get to watch them walk over and over into enemy's reaches while handling ranged weapons and sucking up your extremely scarce resources, and then refusing to get out of the way while attempting to explore.As many failed attempts at escort missions and multiplayer games have proved - it's not fun to babysit the braindead.Even with the action horror and better controls, Obscure 2 sacrifices so much of what made the first one special that it feels completely underwhelming as a result. It's no longer surprising that Hydravision went on to make one of the worst-received Alone in the Dark titles. Play it for the camp plot, but if you're looking for more of the well-designed brilliance that was on par with the great Survival Horrors, you're going to be disappointed.I still recommend Obscure 2 - but it's a lukewarm recommendation."

Gameplay was good but if you didn't like Obscure then you're probably not going to like this one. Combat system was okay, no big changes from the first game, i found melee weapons a little hard to use on some enemies which was not good when i was trying to conserve ammo, the puzzles were interesting and more challenging than the first game. Graphics are okay but no real improvement over the previous game. Level design was pretty cool and the soundtrack was awesome. If you buy this expecting a scary horror game you'll be disapointed, if you want a funny b-horror game than get this."

I loved every minute of it and wish it didn't end, it was a very good, B horror flick type of horror game. So then I went on to this one. This one has made definite improvements to the combat however this can be seen as a detriment as well. While the combat was improved the layout of the game is hindered and much more linear which to me is a bad thing. Story is actually worse than the first, but still in the B horror movie flick sort of way. Given how I was so used to the first obscures controls, camera angle, and combat, this game was difficult for me to get into. All that being said, I am still a fan of this series and I do believe the bundle in particular is worth the price for these games."

Just like Obscure, Obscure 2 (The Aftermath) is another classic gem/nostalgia game if you ever played this game on the PS2. I like the new environments and the new characters on this game but some of the characters from Obscure come back to Obscure 2 world and face the horrific nightmare again! Except this time your characters are College students. I love the plot of the game, the music of the game, and I absolutely love the atmosphere! I also love the music at the main menu of Obscure 2! But there's one thing that I didn't like about Obscure 2 which is its Camera angles/movements. If you move around or turn around a alot with a weapon out, the camera will go bonkers!

The result: Frequent use of healing items, because you take unavoidable damage. Melee weapons do almost no damage and monsters can attack through your attacks, meaning even timing is useless. Since they also leap at you from long range, have fun...fighting anything bigger than a standard ""zombie"" with a melee weapon is a death sentence, so I hope you know how to conserve ammo.- Weapons are not found anymore (most of them at least), but actually have to be unlocked via chests. These chests can only be opened with 3 small keys found around the area. Miss only ONE key and that also means you can't open the chest in that area, which in turn means, you're going to collect a lot of ammo for weapons you don't have...yay. Hunting for the keys for a reward is fine, that reward being the only way to get a new weapon is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, however.- The AI is dumb as hell again and will happily either just stand there taking hits, walk into bad stuff, use important items and ammo for trivial encounters, etc. And outside of combat they will ALWAYS stand in your way and not move away. Thanks to collision that is a major pain in the butt.- Character deaths in-game mean restarting from a checkpoint. Characters now only permanently die as part of the story.- Saving can only be done at certain save points. Once. There can easily be 20 or more minutes between each individual save point in some areas (I think I counted about 16 or so). This is a major step back to the limited saves system in the original.- No difficulty option- Combat still terrible in general, thanks to camera and movement as well as reloading mechanic- Sound assets also still terrible- Inventory management is a pain and for some reason it doesn't matter which characters you control, they always retain the group's weapons. This would be ok, if you only switched characters at gathering points, but mostly you don't even have a choice, the game just assigns you 2 characters for a certain part of the game. Now, somehow that dude that got split up from the group has the same weapons my other guys should technically have...- The levels are for the most part very simple and one way. Compared to the semi open game world of the first game it's a bit disappointing, but then again, the overall area is a lot larger. Still, they could have solved this maybe differently with multiple large ""hub areas"" to explore, instead of ""traditional levels"".- Only about 5-6 hours again. Maybe that's a good thing though. Otherwise the rage meter would be building up too high.Overall, Obscure 2 is a game no one needs to play. For me the story ends after the first game. It had a definitive ending. This one obviously ends on a cliff hanger with a potential for a 3rd one, which is very unlikely by now. Don't even know who has the license to that series...You may want to pick it up as part of a bargain deal, but don't expect much."

76561198027713442,Recommended,254480,25774547,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,Scissorman,"**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**The original Obscure shocked everyone when it was released on PS2 and Xbox in 2004. What was expected to be a dime-a-dozen, bargain bin action game was actually a budget horror title with a pretty good story, graphics, and gameplay featuring co-op that you could play with a friend. It was a surprise hit that received critical acclaim across the board. A co-op survival horror experience that was the first of it's kind, and for a price that nobody could complain about.The story was right out of a 90's teen-horror movie, and greatly resembles the horror film, The Faculty. One character, Stan, even looks exactly like Josh Hartnett. Five high school students become trapped in their school and must survive against deformed creatues who thrive in the shadows. Using flashlights and whatever else they can get their hands on, the students battle their way into the bowels of the school to stop whatever is causing the carnage. Each student has their own abilities. The strong, jock character can run fast and move heavy objects,  the stoner can pick locks, etc. The main objective of the game was the keep the five kids alive to obtain the best ending. If one of the teens die, they stay dead forever. The emphasis of the game was definitely survival.Obscure II (known in the U.S. as Obscure: The Aftermath) came out in 2007. Three of the survivors from the first game make return appearances alongside several new characters. The core gameplay remains the same, but instead of keeping the teens alive, the concentration is more on the narrative. If one of the teens dies, it's game over and you have to restart. No multiple endings this time around, just stay alive until the end.Obscure II see's some improvements from the previous game. When readying an attack, the camera switches to a RE4-style camera, and gives you a target marker, making it easier to attack and switch between oncoming enemies. In the first game you just had to aim and hope for the best. The camera itself is slightly easier to control, giving you full 3D control in most areas.It does have it's downsides. There are save points throughout the game, where in the first game you collected CD's and you could save on the spot. The big downside to this is that you can only use a save point ONCE then it's gone. And the stretches between save points can be long and riddled with enemies. Even though the melee combat is improved, like the first game, using melee weapons is a crapshoot. Getting too close to the enemy always results in unecessary hits. You have firearms, but your instinct is always to save ammunition, and this game isn't too generious with ammo pickups. The enemy A.I. is very cheap and will gang up on you in an instant. Partner A.I. is spotty, and usually ends up wasting precious ammo if you give them a gun (like Sheva in RE5).Obscure II has to have THE MOST DEPRESSING STORY of any game I have ever played. There is a flower growing throughout a college campus called ""Black Lotus"" by the students. The students learn that you can inhale it and get extremely high, so it's popularity begins to spread. One night during a frat party, monsters begin to show up and slaughter the students. Kevin, Shannon, and Stan return from the first Obscure alongside newcomers Corey, Mei, Amy, and Sven. Like the first game, they all have their own unique abilites that will guide you through the puzzles and obstacles you encounter. Remember when I said it's more about the narrative? Well that's because PEOPLE WILL DIE. Like Game of Thrones, the people you least expect to go get slaughtered in horrific ways. The fates of some of these characters is gruesome and sometimes heartbreaking, making this story much darker and more depressing than the first game.If you played the first Obscure, the second is worth your time. LIke the first game it is challenging and entertaining in it's own way. Good story, memorable characters, and decent gameplay keep it interesting for the 6 to 8 hours it will take you to complete it."

It’s much more linear and more focused which can be both a good or bad thing depending on your preference. In the first game you were given the whole school to explore, while in this game you are always focused on one path and constantly switching between characters in different locations for different perspectives. One thing that I failed to mention when reviewing the first game was the soundtrack, it was really good and it is even better in this game. Another thing that I noticed in this game was how hidden the progression was to the next area or an item you are looking for. Because the game uses fixed camera angles for most of the game it’s sometimes hard to spot a door that has a window that you can break to get through because the door is at the edge of the screen and you can’t see it very well. Maybe if the game was widescreen and it didn’t have black bars on the side this wouldn’t have maybe been an issue but there were moments where I was stuck and the solution was very vague and hard to spot. Some of the puzzles are very cryptic and difficult to solve which got annoying. Story and characters are just as stupid as the first game nothing has changed there. The combat is less clunky, the animations are better and the lock on works much better. But overall I found the first game more enjoyable, I think the level design was more unique in the first game and it just had better moments overall.

But it’s not perfect, it does have some flaws, but let’s get to the story.Obscure 2 takes pleas two years after the first game. Kenny and his sister are at Fallcreek University. Stan is reforming his life as a Delivery Truck Driver.And I can’t tell you what happened to Josh and Ashley you’re going to have play the game yourself or look it up. But anyway at Fallcreek University a new type of strange flower is growing around Fallcreek University, a lot of the students have made it into a drug, well if you have played the first game you know where this is going.But anyway now for the game itself.You can play up to 6 people this time, and like first game each one is good at one thing, like Corey Wilde is good at climbing, Mei Wang is a hacker, Sven Hansen is strong, that sort of thing.Spoiler warning, as you go through the game these guys and girls all die but Shannon and Stan. Anyway spoiler warning over.Like in the first game you can only have two at a time, but unlike the first one, were you could use the same two characters for the whole game. In this you need to use all the characters to solve the different puzzles in the game.Now what I liked it this game.One. I liked the story and the notes you can get. They answered some questions I had in the first game.Two. I liked the new monsters, but I wish there were a few more.Three. Liked the atmosphere in the game.Four. Liked how they give you another way to heal.Five. I like how the AI is somewhat better than the first game.Six. Like how they fixed the camera a bit still takes some getting used too. Can be a butt some but not that bad.Now for the things I did not like.One. The characters. This is a big thing witch all most led to a somewhat bad review, but anyway the characters in his game are ether idiots or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or both.Like take Corey Wilde he and his girlfriend go to this party and outside, they see dead bodies. A smart person would call the cops or get back in the car and get help. But nope Corey with his girlfriend Mei Wang goes to check it out. It’s not like they heard someone call for help or something and went to help. No he and Mei just went to check it out.Then when Corey’s car gets taken he goes after it on foot. Even those Shannon said she has a car. Now I know Corey said he has his dad’s shotgun in his car, which raises some questions but anyway he and Amy goes after the car thief, all the why’ll Corey wines about it. When he sees his car is trashed he yells like an idiot and attracts some monsters.And there is this thing with Kenny but that’s going into Spoiler.Two. There was this glitch were the screen went black, I mean you can see your health bar going down but can’t do anything to stop it. But that only has happened to me three or four times.Three. The save points. In the first game you picked up disks to save, you could save were ever you want as long you had a disk. But in this game you save by smelling a flower. I don’t get why they changed the way you save the game disk was better.Lastly number four. The game does end on a cliffhanger.But anyway all in all this was a good sequel to a good underrated horror game it’s not perfect but still again it’s still good.Witch I hope someday a game company picks this series up and we get a third game in this series."

If you have played the first Obscure, then you can see how inferior this game is to that version. The voice acting is different, the characters make no sense from the first game to this one, the saving feature is just plain stupid, and the story goes all over the place. The first Obscure game kept you localized to the school, whereas this one takes you from a house, to the school, back to the house, to the woods, back to the school, and then randomly introduces a whole new character that you have to fight at the end that makes zero sense. This is all of course not to mention the clunkiness of the controls if you arent playing with a controller. I had fun playing this game, but I cant really recommend it simply because of all of the flaws listed above. If you absolutely have to play it, then play it. Its not bad, its just a letdown after playing the first Obscure :(Check out my playthrough video here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u50MGuXl6so"

Now Obscure 2 made these two so f'ing bad, that I can't bear to play this game anymore.The controls were reworked to some TPS/classical survival horror controls hybrid and it's awful. Just in the first five minutes my character wasn't visible on the screen while I was controlling it. The camera angles are changing by themselves and you can control them too, it's just something I think don't work well together, especially when the execution is so terrible. I have no idea why they implemented this TPS type of feel to the game, the combat is more hectic and chaotic from it, you autolock on stuff and you press left click hoping that they will die before your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI partner does. Sure, you can play co-op, but I don't know anybody in a 10 mile area who wants to play Obscure 2, ♥♥♥♥ me I guess. Also the enemies are faster, which makes the left clicking and AI not keeping distance even more exciting.And the storytelling, there are too many dialogues. This sounds ridiculous, but hear me out. When you have annoying teens as your characters who are also underdeveloped and dumb as ♥♥♥♥ you probably want to use them simply as moving flesh to hack. But no, Obscure 2 had to make them talk every 2 minutes, using cringe-worthy and overacted lines. You probably saw it coming, but the voice acting is obviously terrible, so that doesn't help the case.The only positive thing is that they toned down the loud and unfitting music from the first game, they do this rarely now. The atmosphere also stayed the same as in the first game (not considering the constant hair pulling from the things read above), which is great.If you liked the first one maybe, but only if you feel like you can handle the more trashy nature of this game than that one."

The local co-op enhances the fun where another player can join with a controller. But, once again, the funky camera can be a damper on things. As far as the story goes, there is much better out there, and as a solo game, I don't believe Obscure II is all that special by itself. However, playing the sequel after pplaying the original, that opened up the story much more for me personally, as it may for you if you played both.To anyone it may concern, the M rating for the game is well deserved as almost the entirety of the game's story revolves around sexual assault by a demonic plant created monster spawn.6/10 would recommend."

Despite their commercial failures, they are not bad games. They have somewhat decent stories, and are comparable to older horror games. Since this genre is now a dumpster fire of Twitch jump scares and hiding in lockers; it was nice to play true horror games again. I only wish I played these back when they were new, as they certainly haven't aged well. Overall, I recommend the games if you consider yourself an explorer of the horror genre.COPYRIGHT WARNING: If you record these, Obscure 2 will get claimed at certain part in a story cutscene. Luckily Youtube was able to remove this one without a fuss (although it screwed up the audio for several minutes), but I'm still going to mention it."
