It lacks the money management aspect, but for someone like me, who likes creating awesome parks without money limit, this game is for you. All it needs now is the complete release and refined building tools!Edit: Ok I will re-review this game. It has been ages since the last update rolled out, and the game is nowhere near ready for even a ""playable"" release. They did not refine any building tools nor the UI's. Extremely upset with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer. Forget everything I said in my initial review, do yourself a favor, and go buy Planet Coaster. Worst game to spend my $20 money on. Ever."

I foolishly wasted $30 on this a few years ago based off of reviews from places like ""Orlando Attractions Magazine"" and""ThemeParkReview.com""I wonder how much the developer paid them to give good reviews of something that has never made it past an Alpha stage, let alone Beta, or pre-release, etc.  Do NOT waste your money on this folks."

,Recommended,254590,13884063,"Posted: 7 January, 2015",all,Seventy6,"I always used to play RCT3 (probably like everyone else). And I have to say this game is very well structured. I will give you a list comparing this game to RCT3 so you can have a better understanding of what each game brings to the table SO FAR. I say so far because this game is still in development, and it could change. Here is my opinion:>>>>Theme Park Studio vs RCT3<<<<GRAPHICS:Theme park studio wins this one, it has way better graphics, and antialising makes the game look a lot better as well (if you have the graphics card for it). The water reflections look great, and the coaster detail is a lot better. HD!GAMEPLAY:RCT3 wins. RCT feels like an actual amusement park game, because it has a lot of features like the peeps, stands, money, financing, etc. This kind of stuff made you feel like you were managing your own theme park. Theme Park Studio is still in development, so they might add some more features like this soon. It just feels like more of a sandbox than an actual theme park game.COASTER EDITING:Theme park studio is by far the best editor I have come across. There are so many possibilities for coasters, you can truly make it your own.  Each track segment can be edited to your liking, so you can truly make any coaster you have in mind. It is also very easy to use, with some pre-loaded segments like a cobra roll or a loop. When it comes to flexibility, TPS wins.SOUNDS:Although I have big expectations for TPS to have a great sound library, currently i would say RCT has better sounds. They are more consistent, and they have better variety.  For example, on the megacoaster, the lift chain sound on TPS does not make much sense at all. Also, there is no fading so sounds seem to come out of nowhere sometimes. I do expect them to have better sounds in the future though.USER INTERFACE:I'm going to be honest, the TPS user interface takes some getting used to. The RCT user interface in my opinion is more understandable, and it's easier to use. TPS just kind of seems all over the place.  Maybe they will update this soon, i just find it easier to play RCT instead of TPS. But then again, it's also about personal preference.That should cover most of the basic categories.  In my opinion, I prefer Theme Park Studio over roller coaster tycoon.  TPS is still on the early versions, and it has A LOT going for it once they start adding people, and adding more management features. Don't get me wrong, I will always like rct, but tps seems like the next step up.  That is all! I hope this helps some of you clear up some differences.Have a great day ! Dated: January 15th, 2015*Antialising issue fixed!*"

It's insanely customizable, but the user interface and overall software performance is just awful.  If the building is a chore, then why even bother?  Games like Planet Coaster and (my current favorite Parkitect) offer a much greater value, both in building beatiful parks and park management. This ""game"" is garbage that I cannot recommend at all.  Do yourself a favor and don't spend your money on this dreck."

,Recommended,254590,18563647,"Posted: 18 October, 2015",all,XMan,"I have been trying tp keep up wih this game to see how the game is progressing through its development stages and how the development team has been responding to the users and the issues they have been having while trying to run the software. I hope this review helps other make a educated decision on whether the game is worth purchasing. I am happy to report the following observations and my take on the game, even after playing for hours.TPS is a must have for any hardcore fan of the Theme Park/Rollercoaster genre. Not only does the game provide a very strong studio editor for creating your own customized realistic Park, it provides the user with a good educational value of roller coaster physics and 3D edited flat rides. You are only limited in this game by your own imagination.At first glance, the UI looks intimidating,  but the staff at Pantera Entertainment have helped users overcome that obstacle very quickly by providing a strong background of how to use documentation included in the game along with a host of how to videos covering everything from building coasters to landscaping your own park. With that said, understanding the UI can quickly become second nature and easily managed after a few times of use. The incorporated Steam Worshop also makes it easy to import custom scenery and rides into the game without leaving the game interface.The coaster builder will set well with RCT3 fans, as it employees some of the same techniques while adding the ability to easily manipulate the control of creating banked turns and twisted track with the help of track nodes, something that RCTW seems to also be incorporating with their spline based track editor.  The track editor also has more features than RCT3 and without a doubt is better suited towards this game giving the user the ability to manipulate the track in every way possible.Now with all that said, everyone needs to understand that this software is still in the early access program phase and that they may and probally will encounter bugs and crashes due to their computer hardware conflicts and not having updated drivers. But with that thought, I must also say from strong observation, that the development team is doing an excellent job of addressing those issues if the users will report the problems they are having in the forum threads.Most of the people who are complaining and rating bad reviews are those who won't give the team the time to work out the bugs and put out a completed product that is highly polished. I have been able to play the game on a Windows 7 machine that was not build as a high end gaming outfit, very sucessfully. And although I have encourted a crash or two, I can clearly see the power that this game has that can't be found in other theme park builder games on the market.Although the game does not concentrate on the financial management of your park, it still ranks among the top best in Theme Park building games to have for fanatics and should be included in anyone's library who enjoyed RCT3 and/or No Limits Roller Coaster Simulation and for those who are interested in creating a very realistic Theme Park.On a scale from 1 to 5, the game gets 4.5 stars for the power that it has to create any realistic park and for the backup support the team has put into the game and continues to provide for the fan base it has.  If it was not for the fact that the game is still development mode, it would carry 5 stars all the way. Bottom line, this game is highly recommended.So the only question to gamers who are interested in this game, is whether they want to participate in the early access build or whether they want to wait until the game is completely finished. I hope this review helps those who are on the fence deciding on what the game provides and has to offer in the form of Theme Park Simulation building."

The UI is confusing, the path system is frustrating, and the overall presentation is very bland. I know this was never intended to be a full fledged game and more of a tool to design amusement parks, but that's not an excuse for the lack of progress the game has seen.What little I managed to build after a few frustrating hours gameplay was watered down by the dull and lifeless atmosphere. I really wanted to get into this game, but every time I've played I end up just craving something with a little more life to it. As the game stands right now, I can't recommend.UPDATE:Since release, I haven't even be able to launch the game. I was curious to see how the final product turned out, but I guess that will have to wait."

I played alot of rct3 and after a while i seen this game, and once that happened, the game wasnt released and i waited patiantly for the game to come out, and i bought it as soon as i possibly could before roller coasters were released. The game even without roller coasters is amazing, so if you buy this game, be sure to learn everything you can because there is a learning curve, but once you get passed that you will be impressed. This game isnt like rct3 where if you wanted to make a unique roller coaster with hills and loops exactly the way you wanted you couldnt.

You will not be juggling happiness, hunger and money.It's a blank canvas that gives you a free hand to design and create almost any park you can imagine. It focuses almost entirely on the construction (and personal enjoyment) of the park. Visitors are merely there to add movement and life.Personally, I enjoy the no-pressure pace and chance to be creative when I want to unwind. If I'm in the mood for something with a challenge, this isn't the game to launch.If you've ever ""played"" No Limits, it's much closer in spirit to that than almost any other rollercoaster game, but with a whole lot more detail and flexibility.For me, definitely worth the purchase."

Surely they'll iron out all the kinks eventually..."" Two years later, it FINALLY comes out of Early access and... It's still every bit as underwhelming and unpolished as it was in the EA phase, making me not only realize that my money was completely WASTED on this POS, but wonder what in the hell the devs were doing during all that time!?Meanwhile, around the exact same time this ""game"" came out of Early Access, the SAME DEVELOPERS behind RCT3 come out with Planet Coaster, a spiritual successor to RCT3 that manages to completely top this in every possible way...TL;DR, don't buy this.

It's just a sandbox ""game"" now. It honestly can't even be called a game, as games have a sense of goal, challenge, and reward. This delivers on none of those points. After the updates got slower and slower, soon there were more theme park simulators (with actual goals, challenges, and rewards) on the market: Parkitecht (a revamp on the classic style of the first 2 Roller Coaster Tycoon games), Roller Coaster Tycoon World (Atari's latest installment in the beloved Roller Coaster Tycoon series), and Planet Coaster (the spiritual sucessor to Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, made by Frontier, who was one of the dev teams on the game). These 3 games have many of the types of things Theme Park Studio was supposed to live up to. When the updates started slowing, what few updates there were often consisted of compability for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, when most people don't use VR headsets. I absolutely could never recommend this ""game"" to anyone, as it's simply incomplete even at launch.tl;dr just buy Planet Coaster or Parkitecht tbh"

I didn't really see a way to create a horror theme or a sci/fi , adventure, wild west, etc..  One of other things is dark rides and water rides with themes, everything seemed very bland.

The first thing that struck me was how much customization you can give your coasters over RCT. Gone is the grid of RCT! With TPS you can freestyle your coasters any way you want to. I'm excited to see more re-creations of real world rides on the workshop.  Right now (phase 4) there's many coasters to choose from that you can build such as wooden and steel. I haven't really touched onto the scenary and flat rides however, so I'm not sure how they are, but I've heard good things about the customization of those.Pros:-Easy to use interface-Lots of customization-Workshop integration-Build amusement parks!Cons:-None really, just be sure you know your purchasing a early access game.

Doing even the simplest of tasks is confusing and requires extensive YouTube research to be able to figure out. Some minor to severe glitching issues, which can be expected, but can make an already frustrating endeavor even worse when you spend hours getting something right, only to have it dissapear or moved accientally. Building a decent park would likely take as long as building one in real life. Having already purchased the game, I am anxious to see how it develops. especially once Phase 3 is rolled out.

This game beats it in so many ways.It runs really well and the game can handle more stuff in your park than in other rollercoaster park games before.For players who like to create and import their own 3d models into the game. This game cuts the process of importing by a very large amount. It is as simple as exporting the model and importing it into the game. Much hassle by a long shot.The game is still in development, but with each new phase, highly requested and relevent options are given to the players to make their park more lively.Sadly there isn't any ""peeps"" yet so your park looks rather deserted till they finally implement it.The coaster creation system feels new and may take just a little to get used to how it works, but after an hour or so of messing with the options it will feel like second nature.Overall I give the game an 8/10. It still needs improvement and I do find bugs once in awhile, but I logged around 100 hours and enjoy being creative.Here is a picture of my recreation of Disneyland, CA that I have been working on. Almost everything is my own CS and the game has yet to slow down at all.

If you ever want to have full control in desinging your own theme park then this is the program for you.  I will not list everything it can do but I will say this it fully allows you to create your own roller coasters and flat rides as well as other stuff.    If there isn't enough selection you can use any 3D program that can export in the 3ds format.  Right now it is in the beta stages.  For those who still don't know what beta is its still in design or an excellent idea that is slowly growing that's becoming better and better.  The newest addition thats going on is enjoying other peoples theme parks live.  This will be extremely interesting.  Keep in mind that this is a tool and the only thing going for it is the power of creating your own parks.  So if you are the one that has always want to build your own theme park then this is the program for you but if you want to experience the business side of it as well then go play the others but you will have very limmited construction abilities in those types of games.  As far as I know Theme Park Studio is the only TRUE designer of theme parks.  So please support PanteraEnt and if you wait you'll be missing out so much.

Not a hint of anything from the devs. The last announcement was the release announcement. I suspect that with the release of RCTW and Planet Coaster the devs here thought that the steacy tricle of revenue was going to dry up, they were done here, and releaesed as a last grab at cash.I also perused their own website, and a couple of things stand out. Their support forum last post was Sep 2016, even before release.And even shadier and really just not acceptable? They still have a link that seems to let you  continue to donate to the Kickstarer, with an introduction that says it will be released on Steam February 2014. And believe it or not, all ltheir different levels of contribution offer ""rewards"" even up to donating $5,000! What if someone just happens on to that page/site not realizing that the sim is realeased? I find the whole fact that their main website has been abandoned telltale, and that kickstarter page needs to be taken down IMMEDIATELY!!!Again, as I state, nothing breaking about this sim, just be forewarned as I stated below this is more of a toolbox and has no gaming aspects to it whatsoever, and seems to have been abandoned by the dev. And IMHO it should be $19.99, if not $14.99.As you can see I've only tried about 3 hours, but had the game a while. I tried many times hoping updates would draw me in. So take my limited time into account, but I think I've seen enought to sum it up. I won't beat a dead horse, others have covered everything pretty well. Development seemed to die on the vine, and last bit of news before release was six months ago, announcing VR. Really? Think we're done here. Let's just say it is missing the ""game"" aspects as others have pointed out, there is no game. Basically, what you have here is (to me at least) a version of those home improvement software package, like from Home and Gardens, where you can build exact replicas of your house or lanscaping, and then repaint them and change shurbbery around. Many of us have used those, but not for entertainment. Those are used for a purpose, and it's not fun. More like work. It took me a while to figure out why I wasn't enjoying TPS. It's because it feels to me like I'm at work and have been assigned a project. But if that's your thing, you want to build a park and just look at it, you'll be ok with $30 bucks."

I (mostly) like the coaster builder (at times, but it can be seriously glitchy if you don't hit the snap point right; check out my snapshot of a piece of track the game made after I mis-clicked onto the path instead of the piece of track), and the peep system isn't too bad; they look realistic, and their AI isn't the best, but it's the best we have for now, at least until Planet Coaster comes out. No use in hoping for RCTWorld to be saved, because 1) Atari is still in charge of making it, 2) the game's developer has changed 6(?) times, and 3) while it looks bucket loads better than it did when the initial gameplay trailr came out, I'm not sold on the product because I made that horrible mistake with Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. Anyways, let's get on with the greatness of this simulation.1) Paths-Path system is a hell of a lot better than it was, at least for my unobservant self.-Everything is a LOT EASIER to connect, delete, and change around-Paths actually look good while functioning at top quality at the same time, which is rare for these types of game it seems. :P-Paths are nowhere near as bad as I made them seem in my negative review before! :)2) Building Crap-Still a bit ""meh"" every once in a while when it comes to resizing, but overall the system is nice-Benches are a TON easier to actually place on TOP OF the pathways; before the simulation loved to just place them on the ground and pretend no path was even there-Lamps and whatnot are easier to rotate, and the system as a whole is a lot better and much easier to learn than it was before3) Coaster Builder-Top notch customization, although connecting tracks at the end can be kind of hard-So much better than RCTWorld's coaster builder will ever become-Typically lagless, unless you place something wrong, and you KNOW when you have hit the wrong button or done something bad. xD4) Ride Library-Very impressive rides in a pretty massive selection compared to what I expected-Great deal of customization; you can even make your OWN rides!-Incredibly easy to rotate, place, customize, and control; no question from me (a first xD)5) Effects and Environment-Effects are sorta basic, but can add a lot to your park-Environmental features are THE BEST so far. Suck on that, NoLimts 2! :D-Customize everything from effects color and type, to height, start and end, and with environment, everything from the skybox, to the weather and sun/moon positionFINAL REFLECTION-Amazing simulation; by far the best product on the market, but we'll see when Planet Coaster comes out. :P-Everything is done so well in this game, it's crazy! No wonder why it took so long for most of the stages to come out. :3-Everything is fully customizable(except the entrance?), and can be changed in terms of color, size, and many, MANY MORE options!OVERALL RATING: 9/10 Good job Pantera Entertainment!

Despite my rating, I say do not buy it yet unless you're interested in providing feedback for the beta and don't mind dealing with an incomplete and very buggy game. It's got issues, big ones.It's extremely unstable. It's crashed several times and I had to verify file integrity twice because crashes corrupted the defaut demo parks. Took me the better part of an hour and a half to get it to work well enough to test out one of the coasters. I downloaded the coaster of the month from the Workshop for this because there isn't much to the demo parks that come with it by default.It loads slow as well and has a tendency to get to the edge of crashing during a load. I've found the best thing to do is sit back and not touch anything while it's loading. A few of the windows and taskbars will go white while it's loading, but after a few moments it finishes and everything ran fine for the most part.My crashes were mostly related to loading errors and Alt-Tab, the game does not like Alt-Tab and has a nasty tendency to freeze if you do. Once everything was loaded it didn't give me any trouble so far, but still remember to save often if you're building something because I wouldn't trust it to not crash while I was building after a while right now.The only rides you can test are the roller coasters. Hoping that will change in the future. The coasters are cool, but it'd be nice to have a go at anything in the park you can build, including the flat rides. Still worth it for only the coasters, but I'm hoping there will be more to it than that later on.I got stuck a couple of times in some of the scenery when walking about. Not a huge deal, just hit the ticket icon to teleport back to the entrance. Not really a big problem, but it does happen on occasion.It also very badly needs a mouselook button. A lot of the rides and scenery is very tall, but as far as I can tell you can only look about at ground level and can't look up at anything when roaming the park in first person.DK2 support needs work. The view doesn't twist or turn with the ride and simply remains level while rising and falling with the height of the ride and never twiting or inverting with the track. Also, positional tracking for leaning forward and back is reversed, leaning forward makes the player move back rather than forward. That might work for a very basic coaster with no banks or loops, but it doesn't cut it for anything complex enough to be fun to ride in VR.Hopefully Oculus Rift support will be expanded in the future to include wandering about the park itself and trying the other rides as well. Right now it's limited to testing out the coasters only.Why recommend it then?Well, this has huge potential. The Workshop support means that there will be hundreds if not thousands of coasters to play with in the future. People can get really creative with this and it's sure to impress, especially if there's more to it than just riding coasters. It also gives me a solid framerate and no judder on my system, I've got a very nice PC 7970 and 3770k, but I can crank everything to max and have it run smooth in VR, which is very nice. A comparatively weak system should be able to run this at lower graphics settings in VR without too much trouble and it still won't look bad either.No management. There are no resources or management happening. It's a creative toy that doesn't need to be managed to enjoy. The focus here seems to be about building and experiencing the rides, not worrying about customer happiness, whether there are enough bathrooms, or the price of hot dogs.  I like games that do that sort of thing, but it's nice to have something like this that is a purly creative tool that can be experienced and shared.Despite the flaws of the Oculus support, it's still a lot of fun to ride the coasters. The camera desperatly needs to be fixed, there are demos that far outclass what this can currently do because of this issue, but when that's fixed it will be a worthy investment due to what can be accomplished with this game.It's also pretty, not amazing or anything, but the graphics look good for a sim sanbox type game. They run well in VR and look good in the DK2 HMD.I recommend this game because it's got huge potential, especially for those with VR. It's not there yet and if you may be better off waiting until the game is further along before picking it up. It's an early Beta though, so it's issues are not unexpected, though it is a bit more unstable than I'd like and that alone almost got it a ""no"" for now.The creative freedom it allows for, the ability to share and download parks, the potential it has in the future, and the fact that it's still fun to play with despite it's flaws made up for that though. If you've got a DK2 I don't necessarily recommend buying it now, but keep an eye on this one and mark it for later. It will be worth picking up once some of it's problems have been ironed out as the beta progresses."

I'm making this review based on things I've tried for myself.Theme park studio is a great tool for people who want to Design their own theme park. Yes I said design. This game is all about designing a theme park. Not about running one. That means that in TPS (Theme Park Studio) you don't have to care about money. As I said this is a game to design your own themepark. In TPS you will be able to install/make custom content (Scenery, Rides, Textures, Height maps and much more). Using this custom content you (almost) have no limitations to your imagination. A great feature that makes this game different from other theme park related games is the fact that you're able to work with or without a grid. This allows for more natural looking parks instead of having everything line up with each other.Let's talk about some stuff I really like about this game (Those are more opinion based).The path system in this game is nice because you're able to make curved paths without having to download custom content. This also brings some problems (Those things might be fixed in future updates). Building a Y formed path may be hard sometimes. Currently (18-3-2014) you've got to be very creative to come up with solution to prevent strange side walks. But I'm sure this will be fixed.Graphics are something I just love about this game. Having the ability to use high poly models without to much problems really is a thing I like. Also textures look really nice because of normal mapping (Mini 3D details that aren't actually 3D).After all I really like this game and I'm excited to see what Pantera will bring us in upcoming updates!"

They are going to introduce hot keys to get direct to the ride as I have had motion sickness just by walking to the ride with the controller.  The big mystery of how to walk in VR without sickness is yet to be solved.  The hyper jump just ins't convincing for me.Sounds on the coasters could be improved but not bad by any means.  Thery have also fixed the seat issue which had you floating around the seat which is good to see.There are other rides you can try.  In California there is some 2 pod rotating ride, it has nice wind sounds and it defintely makes you feel like you are on the ride and I prefer this to the coasters.  There is also a karting track, but I personally I don't feel it adds anything to the game.Overall in my 2 hours of trying the VR side this is a great start.  Reading the Beta mails, they have a lot more planned as well, so looking promising.If your a Vive owner and you're waiting for a coaster, this ticks the boxes and is ready now.  I know a lot of people have requested the No limits game to have Vive support, but this already has it and more.I will update the more I play and also on the building park side."

But that recommendation is based only on the the rollercoasters.The path system is difficult to use, and doing things like intersecting or splitting paths requires either special pieces which severly limit your designs, or you have to settle with goofy looking overlaps, in other cases you just can't do what you want. There are very few flat rides in the game and very few on the Workshop and those are of varying quality. It's almost as if the developers may plan on relying on their customers to make most of the real content. Most of what I see has me thinking that these guys may be in a little over their heads, or they simply released too early for even early access. I should probably note that my problems with the path system made me largely ignore the terraforming and landscaping tools, so I don't know much about those.But now there's coasters, and while the interface isn't the best, it's not bad. The only tool I find myself really wanting is for the length slider to allow for longer track pieces. The coaster selection is slim but reasonable for the first release, as is the selection of premade special track pieces. You can however make just about any track shape you want, however it's not easy to get things smooth or symmetrical at this point without using the easy editor.So if you just want a really good, likely to be great coaster editor, go ahead and grab this game. Just be willing to accept that development on other aspects of the game may be slow or incomplete, but the developer could finish the game as described and any future RCT titles may be in trouble."

Sadly I only had time for a quick look and can still see some areas that need further work but there's no doubt that significant progress has been made that leads me to believe that these areas will also in time get attention. Certainly from  the quick look I had I've got little doubt I could now work around any other issues such that they would no longer detract from my enjoyment too much. Based on what I've witnessed I now feel able to recommend this title to those who are interested.**********Been keeping an eye on this and No Limits 2 for a while and decided that now that the first 2 stages of designing coasters had been implemented I'd take the plunge as I wanted a tool for designing a wider world than NL2 is really intended for. I can see the potential in it but there are so many frustrating design flaws that I really haven't enjoyed my time with it so far.First issue is basic camera control. Apparently most users found the original setup really bad so they improved it. If this is the improved version I'd hate to think what the original was like. Okay, it's not terrible but is still very clunky and for a game that involves construction and therefore moving around all the time it should be better. Worst element is that although you can refine the controls there are bugs that mean the game 'forgets' your settings or jumps camera position at times. Bugs in elements like this should have been fixed much earlier in the development lifecycle.Everything from landscaping to placing track pieces is simple but simply complicated if you want to move from default values. The landscaping tools are an example of where you can set parameters, use the tool, use another tool, move back to the first tool and bam, your settings have reverted to defaults again. Because the settings are hidden behind another button you don't see them, click on the screen and damage your landscape. There's no undo feature so getting back to what you had can be a real pain. Forgetting to include an 'undo' function in a construction game beggers belief!Place track and ask it to cut into the landscape - instead of cutting to just below the track surface it sometimes decides to eat a much bigger hole out of the ground instead. Try to raise blocks of terrain to resolve - it seamingly raises or lowers as it sees fit based on surrounding tiles! It's frustratingly difficult on occasion to grab a single terrain tile and raise 1 step at a time.Designing flat rides in game is complicated. Elements like joints etc are in a different group to beams and blocks so you are constantly switching back and forth. Once built you need to add keystone animation. Why not have pre-built ride types where you can just click on individual pieces and edit each bit to create something unique which the game then compiles into an animated finished item using a built in physics engine? The more advanced tools could remain for those that want them. The building blocks are all in game but most people seem to be using an external tool for construction which speaks volumes.I can see the potential in the title and the fact that they wanted to create a powerful design tool to build your theme park but the same level of power could have been achieved in a far more user friendly way. Yes it's early access so bugs and other issues are understandable but there are fundemantal flaws in design concepts that will always exist. RCT3 was simple but limited in building blocks. Pantera should have 'borrowed' the same basic concept of simplicity in this title but expanded on the blocks and their functionality to increase the power. Click and place is fine but more expansive tools and features just aren't as obvious as they could have been. Sure you could design some beautiful creations in this over time but it's just a question of how often you want to bang your head against the wall in the process"

People still have not been added, so I'm waiting for that. Building paths and coasters can be confusing. I like the way paths could be constructed in RCT3, where it was easy to do things. TPS has more free flow, but intersections are almost impossible to make.Coaster building is somewhat like in RCT3 where there are premade sections you can build. It also has a touch of NoLimits because you can have more free flow to your rides. There's just a problem with block sections and adding new trains. I could not find a way to color my rides either. Smooth and straight options are desperately needed.If you decide to terraform, make sure you do it before adding trees. If you add trees first, the terrain will raise around the trees so it looks like the trees were dug into holes in the ground.I found many bugs and glitches in the game. It never completely crashed, but it froze many times. I stopped playing it mainly because of that.5/10 - It's okay, but needs a lot of work. I recommend waiting until it's completely finished."

They have atmosphere, noise, ambience, they make you feel like your running a real theme park that is all about fun, this game, if you can call it that, is not about fun. It feels like learning to master a program like 3DSMax.Either way, not a complete game, but who cares, paying for a game means you absolutely no right to criticise it in any way, as with the game forums, you'll soon find if you have anything negative to say, the townsfolk will be out at you with torches and pitch forks."

I purchased this game on a windows 8 computer with all of the requirements needed for this game. The game crashes everytime I open it. I do not know whether it is the functionality of the game or my computer. I would not have purchased this game if I knew this would happen.

I want to build a park with objective and an easy to use, fullscreen game engine. My favorite park builders are the RCT franchise, and this is too much of a developer-class program for me. There are no objectives, no restrictions, and no enjoyable moments to this. If you're looking for an alternative after Atari's RCT World trailer came out, you're out of luck here.UPDATE: RCTW EA is out, Planet Coaster is in AlphaThe competition has come out. Finally. So first, Planet Coaster looks like it's going to come out on top for those who want a game-like management experience. Roller Coaster Tycoon World looks like RCT3 with slightly better graphics and slightly worse engine. Theme Park Studio, it's an editing tool. Not a management game. Don't be decieved. Don't buy it if you're at all interested in the management side or an actual game, and don't be decieved by RCTW's lower price compared to Planet Coaster for early access. Planet Coaster is the best park sim in the works right now. But if you want a complex studio tool that's EXPLICITLY built for making park rides, then maybe this will be the one for you. For most people, I don't think so."

It's not even just from being in development. A lot of the disappointment comes from design decisions, the focus of development, and the user interface. It would be great if they eventually turned things around, but I'm taking a long break from it in the meantime."

How do I create a new path without continuing on the old one - like I want to make cross sections of the path... buggy, clunky, missing crucial elements.  Ok, I get it... it's a pre-release alpha.  I forked $30 for essentially a terrain tool, and a clunky one at that.  Maybe in a year it will be worth it... by that time who knows if the game will be done or work on new OS systems.  Truly unbelievable that this would get out for more than $5.  really, just save your money and play rollercoaster tycoon 3 or something else."

I'm very disppointed as the sponsored reviews made reference to it being comparable to Rollercoaster tycoon.  After an hour of searching, reading tutorials, and frustration, I was unable to even build a rollercoaster and activate the park with guests.  It's more of a modeling program than a game. If anyone can show me I'm greatly mistaken in my review, I am more than happy to listen as I had high hopes for this game.  Otherwise, I will write this game off as a loss.:-(After additional reading, I'm learning now that this game is a work in progress with a lot of basic funcationality missing.  I wish I could get my money back and buy it when it's at least 20% complete."

If paying for extremely unfinished, janky tools is your thing, then sure, get this. I should note that at this stage it doesn't seem you can make Coasters, either."
