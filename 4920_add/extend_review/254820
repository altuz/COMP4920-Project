Loved the atmosphere (I've always been a fan of sci-fi), the lore, soundtrack, and the graphics were (they still are, especially Ground Control 2) amazing.This is a very good game for those who have been missing old school games of the RTS/Tactical genre."

Apart from that, have at it and enjoy, I have not had any compatibility problems so far on Windows 7 64."
,Recommended,254820,29557854,Posted: 28 January,all,Burn,"Talk about revolutionary, this game was released in 2000 and it was way ahead of its time! While the graphics are dated, this game is still fun and enjoyable to play even 17 years later. It beats many of the more modern genre options in the way it implements combat and accounts for relevant combat variables such as lighting, visibility and terrain elevation. The most mind blowing for me at the time when I first played this game were the air battles - because of other RTS games I was used for the air units to remain immovable in combat, while in this game when in combat the aircraft remains in motion and fly around gloriously. Great game!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=851590477http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=851606222"

Correct, Ground Control is back you chaps and chapettes, and it works flawlessly on Windows 10 I might add.For you fresh potential volunteer commanders for the Crayven Corporation, rest assure, you will meet battle where advanced battle tactics need to be used! You do not construct bases, but you manage Dropships in terms of what units you will use, and as you progress, the more units become available, but fact of the matter is, you choose what you want. Do you want to use Jaeger Special Forces recon troops to scout the area undetected to then sneak your artillery nearby to blow everything to kingdom come? Or do you prefer to rush into an enemy heavily defended base with scout vehicles to quickly take out the anti-air defenses, so that you can pull out in time and have your aerodynes fly into the base and bomb it all to ashes without any air defenses. Or perhaps, do you want to roll into the bases with a mix of heavy guns and marines? YOU DECIDE ! This is Gound Control !This package contains the main campaign plus the expansion pack (known as DLC today). The main campaign takes you in command of the Crayven Corporation (Crays) and the Order of the dawn (Dawnies). Playing the game on normal difficulty will take you approx. 10 hours for the Crayven Corporation Campaign, and another 8 for the Dawnie campaign. 18-20 hours of missions !! And this without the expansion pack, because with the expansion pack, add another 15 hours, so you are looking at a solid 32-35 hours of Campaign missions on the normal difficulty setting, for this low price! And keep in mind, this is one of the most amazing RTS games ever made, and there is a Ground Control 2 as well !!! (sold separately).With the Crayven campaign you mostly assume traditional missions of base destructions, but once you play for the Dawnies, expect more fast paced guerrilla warfare and hit and run tactics, because you are fighting outnumbered most of the times with inferior equipment because hey, the Crays did kick your♥♥♥♥♥just shortly before so don't expect it to be easy!Despite the somewhat outdated graphics the explosions and gun fire etc effects as still beautiful. There are some guys that still play multiplayer, but google it as you will find all the info there (some dedicated servers are still up with plenty of players).Pros:- Fun and amazing missions!- Great visuals despite aged graphics- Great sound and amazing battle soundtracks- Awesome Units with micromanaging secondary and tertiary abilities during combat- Dropship unit loadout customization- Plenty of hours of gameplay- Low price- Classic RTS game (top 5 next to Old westwood studios C&C games, Homeworld, etc), a must have!- Entertaining briefing/debriefing and lore (story)- 40+ missions!!!- Works flawlessly on Windows 10- Units have weakspots (rear takes more damage on tanks, etc).- Many fun units to choose from and play- Battle formations to choose from- Can use terrain and shadows etc as a tactical advantage!!!- Great tutorialCons:- Cannot save during game. Play it on LIGHT or EASY for the first time since normal is like a game on Hard today.- No skirmish mode (Single player campaign only and for Multiplayer, find info out of game first how to join!)- Micromanaging units during intense combat can be frustrating at times due to game mechanics. Units need a lot of room to pass each other, they easily get stuck with each other showing their rear to the enemy and taking much more damage. Big chance to lose your command APC that way =Mission failure.- Constant friendly fire messages ""Squad 1 taking friendly fire"" etc, etc, however, friendly fire is mitigated significantly, you only take tiny damage but still very annoying to hear those messages all the time. Terrain often does not give enough room to prevent friendly fire, thus those warnings and friendly fire cannot be avoided.If you are an old school or newbro RTS fan, you MUST get this game at all costs, and after you beat this game and its Dark Conspiracy expansion pack (included in bundle), you must play Ground Control 2.DISMISSED !"

Working excellently on Win 10 and graphics are still quite good, considering how old the game is. But gameplay, gameplay is still very good and I am enjoying this game again a much. Even controlls are still accetable for such a old game. Highly recommended. I just put down all fallout 4, FM2016, NFS and playing this game.

,Recommended,254820,16992980,"Posted: 11 July, 2015",all,Concordion2k,"I played this title as a teenager way back in 2000. It was one of the first RTS games I had played that ditched resource management and focused solely on squad tactics. The game succeeded wildly in hooking me into the story, through its excellent voice acting and deep gameplay mechanics. The visuals still impress me even today, 15 years later!Fun Fact: Jennifer Hale is the voice talent behind the game's protagonist, Sarah Parker. Her work alone makes the game a delight to play.I include Ground Control with the likes of Homeworld as members of a gold standard for unique, top-tier RTS games. If you want a fun sci-fi story coupled with deep strategy, you'll want to pick this one up."

The gaming magazine that I loved was distributing a demo of the Ground Control and I was so impressed with everything I saved my allowances just to buy this game. The Science Fiction theme, memorable Soundtrack, the reactions of your units; it's all just in such a perfect place that they've found the brilliant balance of making an amazing game. - All you get is what you prepare before the mission; these type of games are not popular these days, it's shameful really.Ground Control is probaby one of the best video games ever made and it was so damn ahead of its time that you get a gem like this once a decade or two.Buy this game immediately."

If the cutscenes won't play, turn of the ""Fullscreen Movie"" option under the General tab. It will save you time with the sluggish customer service."
76561198054005124,Recommended,254820,18653163,"Posted: 24 October, 2015",all,Ghost Ravenstorm,"I grew up playing this a lot. Hands down my favorite RTS of all time. But its 2015 and this could use a remaster to fix a few annoyances. Its needs wide screen, window mode support, and better cursor acceleration options. Homeworld received a remaster, so I hope for the best here.On wide screen if the resolution is streched, you may run into the issue with the cursor whipping across the screen horizontally and it might sometimes move at a crawl vertically. If you have third party mouse drivers that control DPI, you might want to disable them here and tweak the game's mouse sensitivity to your comfort. The awkward acceleration on modern hardware does make it tricky to micro your squards to move them out of focus fire and/or friendly fire in the heat of combat."
76561197992229015,Recommended,254820,23676195,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,Dire,"Alrighty. An RTS classic. Ground Control does not feature any base building.Pros:- Interesting gameplay (at the time)- Friendly Fire system- Several difficulty levels- Long, narrated story (45 missions in total)- Plethora of units- 2/3 factionsCons:- As I said the gameplay is no longer up to snuff.- Atrocious path finding. Units will get stuck frequently or get ""lost"".- Very slow moving units.- Story gets bland with the introduction of the addon.- Factions aren't unique enough. Basically they all got the same units, minus some special skills, stats and a few unique units.- Obviously very dated graphics.- No save system, no check points...Summary:GC and its addon are definitely not geared towards the casual player. You basically get a handful of units for every mission, which are not replenishable, meaning, when a squad gets completely wiped out it's gone for good, which does not only suck for the mission, but for the overall campaign, since your units ""supposedly"" level up (never really noticed that, but apparently they get more accurate, more durable, etc.). The good thing is that you can restart a mission at any point and get your units back, the bad part is, there is NO save system whatsoever. That 90 minute mission you just failed at the last instance? Yea, you gotta repeat it ALL again. The addon also introduces some fairly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ insta fail missions called ""infiltrations"". In these you have to find your way through the map with only 1 or 2 sniper squads...preferably unseen. If you get spotted the mission is not failed, but the enemy WILL kill your units pretty quickly. Also, ♥♥♥♥ing snipers don't deserve the name. While they kill many units in 1 hit, they aren't all that accurate. I've once spent 5 minuts trying to hit 1 infantry guy...The game also moves at a glacial pace. You might be looking at your units crossing a desert for several minutes until they arrive at the next nav point. Even worse is that you can't just order them there, because the path finding will ♥♥♥♥ it up, so you basically creep forward inch by inch...and wait for your slowest units to still catch up...only to have them encounter an ambush, a mine field or spawned event enemies, which you are unprepared for against. Guess what, you might just have to repeat it all over again. The addon introduces some ""interesting"" mission concepts. However, they don't really work that well with the responsiveness of the game. While your units move fairly slowly (at least the more powerful ones), they can die pretty quickly in combat, especially if they are shooting each other.Say hello to the friendly fire system...just don't. Theoretically you should be able to arrange your units to not suffer friendly fire. Practically I found that to be an insane amount of micro management and frustration, changing formations, ordering troops out of the way...having them walk around confused in circles thanks to the path finding...and have fun ordering a heavy tank into another position.This is a game for die hard fans of squad based RTS games...not sure it's for anyone else. At the end I chose to cheat my way through it, because the glacial pace of the gameplay coupled with the lack of a save feature was just too much to handle for me. I just wanted it to be over. Got through the Crayven campaign without cheating at least.Still a good game for its age...if you're looking for this kind of gameplay."

,Not Recommended,254820,29924743,Posted: 14 February,all,PurpleXVI,"Not as good as nostalgia made me remember it.In my memories, Ground Control was essentially sci-fi Myth, but it turns out I was remembering wrong. Myth had its share of issues, but it didn't have the mess of slow unit responses, terrible unit AI(I can't count the number of times that half my troops' fire, or their special attacks, were wasted because the front lines hit the back lines, or blasted away into terrain rather than moving an inch right or left) and incredibly unclear fields of view(you'll only know how far your units can actually see when something suddenly pops into view. A visible field of view or obscuring fog of war would have done wonders).The writing's decent, though for some reason it feels like they switched VA's for established characters between GC1 and Dark Conspiracy. But ultimately the game is 95% gameplay, and 5% story, so even good writing can't really bouy poor gameplay.Also kinda buggy, with missions that sometimes arbitrarily seeming not to finish/progress, forcing you to replay them, and with Dark Conspiracy forgetting my campaign progress when I exit. Not too great.The soundtrack is excellent, though. Very good at setting a mood."

A RTS with no base building. One good thing about this game is that you can slightly configure the units you want to bring along on your mission. The bad thing is that it doesn't save your load out, so you have to keep reconfiguring each time. At most you will control up to 13 fighting units, though the air units are kinda useless since they die easily. I would say this was a great game for 2000, but not so much today. I think it is a good deal for $1.50, but playing the game, I was more frustrated with it than having fun. I had a hard time moving my army in formation, since they like to dance around each other. I was also annoyed by the indestructible walls and the amount of friendly fire. The game is challenging, though that might be because you can't save in game and can't give orders while in pause. Rate 4.5/10."
