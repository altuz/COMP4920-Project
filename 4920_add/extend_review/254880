I bet this Steam release will change that.The game lacks  support and online play and I can only hope that one day it will be patched in by the community. Other than that it's a completely unique game that requires both strategical planning and skillful timing. The single palyer challenge provides hours of gameplay and multiplayer through LAN is truly a fun and interesting experience.Edit: Turns out the community delivered a utility for online play and random generated maps long before my comment, search for moonbase commander console on google."

Was saddened when it disappeared into the maw of Atari, never to be seen again. Until now!This may be the best strategy game that nobody played, and it just begs for a modern port for touchscreen devices. It's just an awesome strategy game with simple controls, and a depth that really grows on you over time. Yeah, the graphics are nothing special, they looked 10 years old when the game launched 10 years ago. The multi-player is LAN only. The voiceover accents are cheesy. It doesn't matter.You play by launching one of 18 nodes onto the battlefield, scorched eath style. Every node costs energy, and is connected  to the node that launched it by a chain. If a node is destroyed, the nodes launched from it are destroyed in a chain reaction. There's the skill of placement, the tactics of deciding what to launch, and the strategy of resource management and the fog of war. There's never been another game quite like it, before or after. And that's sad. But at least you can still play this, even on Windows 8.1, 64 bit.Penny Arcade's effusive love for this game is still as relevant today:http://penny-arcade.com/2002/06/11As this is an old game, there's not a lot of handholding. The challenge mode works as a tutorial, but you really should read the manual. Seriously.It shows that this was a labor of love by a developer otherwise known for children's games. They must have polished this sucker in the back room for years playing amongst themselves. I've no idea how they made the pitch for this game work, but I'm still glad they did. Personally, I bought this just to convince Rebellion that a modern port is worth their time, this is one of the few game CDs that I've kept on the shelf since I bought it, and carefully re-installed on every new machine."

My friends and I used to create a virtual LAN by using Hamachi but it's difficult to get most people to go through all that trouble to play an old game like this.

Thing looked old, but I figured ""why the hell not?"".It's a fun little game with an interesting feature: You fight with your buildings, not soldiers.You become more powerful by expanding your base, setting Energy Collectors to boost the amount of energy you have to spend each turn, which allows you to perform more actions, such as launching more buildings and attacks.The base is expanded by launching structures from a ""Hub"", which is the primary building for attacking and expanding the base. The hub can launch other hubs for further expansion, or set defensive buildings like forcefield generators and anti-air missile bases. And, of course, they can launch energy collectors for collecting energy. The Hub can also launch attacks against other buildings by launching a variety of ranged attacks, such as regular bombs, scatterbombs, missiles, and even a virus! The Hub can also launch a special ""offensive"" building which can only launch attacks, but at a far greater distance than the regular Hub.This game also has a unique feature where all the bases are connected to each other by Power Cords. The power cord shows not only which bases are connected, but which hubs are supplying them power (aka which hubs they were launched from). If you destroy a hub that is supplying power to other buildings, those other buildings are also destroyed.All in all, this game is fun. My favorite attack is the Energy Spike. You can hit cords and attack the two buildings on both ends of it!"

Nevertheless, its simple rules and complex gameplay are genius.First, the only game mode I have spent any significant time in is singleplayer skirmish.  I do not know if Multiplayer works yet, but if I try it, I will update this review to include it.  Skirmish seems like the only gamemode that really shines; challenge mode is generally irrelevant / uninteresting, in my opinion.Pros / things I personally like:It is easy to understand quickly.It has a phenominally crafted strategy framework, allowing a different scenario every game.It is very inexpensive.Cons / things I personally dislike:It is incompatible with the Steam overlay.You cannot control how large the game shows up on your screen.On some computers, if you try to switch from the game to another window and then witch back to the game (using alt+tab), the graphics fail.You might experience some technical hiccup along the way, like the one I described above, due to the game's age.At the end of the day, though,The benefits of this game far outweigh the costs, making this an incredibly fun game for you or your friends.

If your main base is destroyed you are dead. Its the same for your opponents.There are 2 ways to win in this game :First is to try kill the enemy main base ASAP on turn 4/6 and get +7 enegy and go for the next enemy or expand your economy and then kill the rest.Second is to be good at aiming and hit the energy pool on first turn and after that you can go for the next energy pool or try fighting.Important !!! Disable fog of war , the wind and play on flat maps till you get use to the game machanics.

The way it blends strategic, turn-based mechanics with the action and precision of the aiming mechanics is really something very unique, and insanely addictive.I like the unique mechanics, the innovative aiming system that vaguely reminds me of golf games but better, the well-balanced gameplay and weaponry, the sick music, and also the ability to create your own maps. Only things I dislike are relating to its age really, the resolution is kinda poor and you have to somewhat jump through hoops to play online. There are community tools to make online play easier, but it doesn't function through Steam.I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys both action and strategy games, and even to anyone who likes only one of these styles, as it's sure to hook you either way.

But it is a shining gem of design, where a scant 18 units, several environmental factors, and the inherent complexities of varying numbers of combatants combine to form gameplay that is an exceptional embodiment of what it means to be ""compelling"".Note that it is not Starcraft, or Civilization, or Advance Wars, but parallels can be drawn with all of these despite Moonbase Commander's unique eccentricities. Things like graph theory and virtual spatial awareness play different roles here than in other similar titles. Take care to attack with efficiency, but remember that one bridge being destroyed can wipe out your entire strategy in an instant.Those who enjoy turn-based RPGs and strategy games are urged to investigate this, but with the caveat that a timer be kept on hand, as Moonbase Commander can alchemize a full day into a blur of confrontations, chronically catchy soundtrack and numerous instances of the word ""crawler"" being employed as an expletive."

I highly recommend it (and, it goes on sale for under $1 from time to time).Some helpful information:  It is turned based; however, the turns can be timed if you want (60, 30, or 15 seconds).  The game does not work across the internet without a third party tool (look for the Moonbase Commander steam group to find that tool called -- it's called Moonbase Console, and it can procedurally create random maps as well).  It includes a built in map editor.  Also, the game has a very easy learning curve... there are not that many units, so it is a good intro strategy game for when friends come over.

It's definately my favorite strategy game of all time.I own a physical copy of this game, played it when I was six years old! I sucked at it back then but today, I beat Brutakas!The enemy AI is stunningly inteligent, sometimes while playing I'll feel like I'm playing one of those computer chess games where the computer just does not mess around.The challenge mode missions are fun and, as the name implies, challenging.LAN multiplayer is a blast! If you're playing with a few friends who are as equally skilled at the game as you, then it can be a blast! Just make sure you don't play against a person whose new to the game, you'll crush them easilly. Moonbase Commander is highly skill based game, I'd go as far and say that it's probably the most solid skill based game out there.There is only one complaint I have with the game, which is that there is a balancing issue when it comes to underwater crawlers. Those who have played this game probably know what I'm talking about. If a crawler is launched into water, then it becomes the most overpowered weapon in the game, because the only way to neutralize it is to hit it with another crawler, when both crawlers hit each other, they detonate. This means that if a crawler is underwater right next to the shoreline, and you have buildings next to the shoreline, there is no way to stop the crawler from detonating and destroying your buildings. And if you think that's bad, it gets worse, because despite not being able to get hit by anything aside from other crawlers, missles will STILL lock on to the little things, and they won't do any damage to them. Underwater crawlers are easilly my least favorite thing about this game, and the more devious computers love spamming them.  Normally, crawlers aren't that ridiculous, because when they're on ground you can hit them with any type of weapon, and hitting them with a reclaimer defeats them without having them detonate. But put a crawler underwater, and it becomes very annoying. Honestly, a good way to balance it is if they would have allowed reclaimers to hit them while they're underwater.So yeah. That is seriously the games only flaw. And guess what! If you don't play on levels that have a ton of water, then underwater crawlers won't even be an issue!But, let's not leave things off on a bad note. I'm now going to discuss some of the even cooler things about this game!This game features a map editor where you can make your own planets! And then you can play on them with your friends! And the map editor gives you a surprisingly large amount of freedoms, you can set spawn points, you can set multiple spawn points for different types of game types (such as if it's a team battle, a four on four battle, or a two on two battle). The map editor makes the possibilities of this game considerably greater, and I love it to death!This game also features some interesting ways to change the game. In skirmish mode you can play with teams, set a WIND setting that changes the game feel considerably, and allows you to turn off fog of war. These options allow you to adjust the game to your preferences, in order to create the most fun experience possible.Finally... presentation. This game is gorgeous for a 2002 PC game. The theming of this game is awesome! Each of the four factions has their own narrator, and layout. In skirmish mode you can change the color of the team, and your faction, which also changes the color and style of your in game menu.The four factions are as follows, (I'll give you my vague understanding of what they're supposed to be):NiceCo: Russian utopians who are hungry for control. ""They will fall to our superior gameplay.""Dewulf: Industrialists who sound like agents from The Matrix. ""We're gonna own this planet.""System 7: Evil robots who are obsessed with triangles for some reason. ""Our Galactic domination will continue.""Team Alpha: Military guys, the good guys, on a quest to save the galaxy. ""Nice shot shirley! Keep em coming!""My prefered fraction is Dewulf. But everyone else I know loves Team Alpha the most because they don't give you a hard time when you miss a shot.Also it should be a mention that this game has a AWESOME soundtrack.Final thoughts? GET THIS GAME. This game is awesome! And this downloadable version is just like the physical copy version! Except this one actually works on my new laptop, which has Windows 10.I give this game a perfect 10/10. One of my favorite games of all time. I honestly should have bought it twice during the winter sale and gifted it to one of my good friends ."

Due to its layout it looks kind of simplistic in the way it could be associated with a product addressed to younger - in terms of age - audience, but it is a disfavour to take it as that.

The controls are intuitive and the overall proceeding easy to learn. Additionally worth to be mentioned is the nice electro-type music, decent narrator commentary sound and beatable settings menu, which includes a skirmish mode. Multiplayer option is available only with direct connection, therefore tertiary STEAM-incompatible platforms ought to be utilized as a common solution, which is a pity after all, since the game would be outstanding in that aspect.

After finally finding it I am once again addicted to it! I love the retro-style strategy in this. Really good graphics for what its worth back then. Still enjoying it!

It's the kind of battle game that's easy to learn and hours of fun. The AIs are actually pretty good too, with a significant range of difficulty level. Every once in a while they'll do something stupid enough to make you laugh, but for the most part they provide perfectly challenging opponents."

This version has it built-in, which is great!Even if you can't drum up other players to annihilate, the single-player Challenge Mode should keep your strategic brain ticking over nicely. I can't recommend this game highly enough!My one criticism is that you can't change the resolution at all, which is unfortunate, but not too much of a problem, really."
