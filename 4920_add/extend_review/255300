Also it has lovable characters and nice songs.It is a short game and you will finish it in a few hours but it worth it. It has cool achievements to unlock and this will double the playing time.

It is a fun little game, a little on the short side. The humour is great,  although it ventures into the slightly lewd at times, The fun characters and puzzles are accompanied by the undertone of the world having gone through nuclear holocaust. Nothing beats Nuclear Holocaust in giving a game a dark tone. That said the game still manages to be relatively jovial and light-hearted.The story follows two friends trying to make it in a world now ruled by militant ants. With the help of a few friends along the way they battle against the military might of ants. I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Again it was a bit short but the puzzles were varied and interesting. The characters are conveyed through their interactions as no dialogue is used. Speech/thought bubbles are used throughout to help characterize and indicate what you need to do to progress. It is really well done. The graphics and art style fit the game. Also the sounds are excellent, there is no voice acting as such but you get a real feel for the characters from the sounds, screams, etc. that they do make. The""cut scenes"" come in the form of animated ""comic panels"" another style choice of which I approve.If you are a fan of this kind of game I would pick this up."

Bought it cheap and for that amount of money (around 1 eur) it is absolutly worth to play.  Not for the full price tho.The story ends a bit weak, which made it not satisfying for me.  The puzzles are not too hard, apart from a few. I had to check a walkthrough once and few other times it took a lot of time to get an idea of the solution.   Lot of trial and error.In short, it is not  a bad game, but also not a star. I really enjoyed  the way it was setup, being able to walk on walls and ceilings. This gave the game a nice perspective.  ALso I enjoyed the drawingstyle. A bit childish, but I don't mind that. Some funny pics there.verdict: 6.5/10"

And who would have thought a cockroach could be so gosh-danged adorable?!This is a game entirely without dialogue or writing -- the instructions, the character's ideas, conversations, etc. are explained entirely in thought-bubble cartoons -- and it just WORKS. It's a game you could share internationally without ever worrying about a language barrier! And the game itself is loads of fun to play! Set in a post-apocalyptic world in which things like roaches, rats, bees, spiders. etc. are the lone surviving inhabitants, players take on the role of an adorable little roach who wants to save his accident-prone friend from a series of escalating perils so that they can enjoy a beautiful flower together -- the first flower seen in a very long time. The puzzles are fun and engaging, the characters are likeable, the controls are simple and fun, and many of the adventures and puzzles you encounter take full advantage of the little roach's ability to walk up walls and along ceilings.I really can't recommend it enough -- a truly delightful experience!"

76561198112059304,Recommended,255300,13219587,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,Pannacone,"Journey of a Roach is a point and click adventure game with a stylistic twist: as a cockroach, you can climb on nearly any surface, including the ceiling. This allows the main character, a cockroach named Jim, to traverse levels in a uniquely three-dimensional manner, with his main goal being to rescue his friend from a gang of kidnapping ants. The wall-crawling feature, along with the game's charmingly excitable characters, creative level design, and user-friendly puzzles, makes for a pleasant point and click experience.Like most point and click adventure games, the main goal in Journey of a Roach is to collect various items and then use them in the correct locations. Often the items are in hard to reach locations that require creative climbing to get to. Sometimes you might have to combine items in your inventory so that they can be used to solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves are fairly straightforward, with nearby NPC's often giving small clues whenever you happen to get stuck.At first the level design in Journey of a Roach seems rather simple, but as you go on they grow complex. The levels are often big and have several different branches of items to collect for multiple different puzzles at once. However, instead of overwhelming you, the amount of puzzles allows you to bounce back and forth between them when frustrated, minimizing the time you'll spend blindly wandering about wondering what to do.Solutions for the puzzles, much like the chattering, nonsense voices of the characters in Journey of a Roach, are often silly and happily humorous. At one point I was asked to bring an ant a burger and I fashioned one out of a piece of sponge, a shoe, and a handkerchief in order to continue onward in the story. The game ends on an equally laugh-worthy and heartwarming note, making it a great game if you want a quick, light-hearted adventure."

I saw it come up as a Steam advertisement, and after having seen a dozen or more “stupid” games being advertised, something in me decided to check out one of them. I picked this up for a few dollars, and it sat unplayed for most of a year.By the time I dusted it off last week, I was pleased to find that it was exactly what I was looking for. Simply put, it is an adventure-puzzle game with a very simple and intuitive interface, and yes, you are a roach.I enjoyed almost every aspect of the game. I laughed, felt sad, smiled, and felt my eyes go wide on a few occasions throughout. It is a short game, but that is something I count as an advantage. I feel that I got everything I wanted out of it and did not waste time on repetitive content.Journey of a Roach is a single-player game, but in retrospect, it would have been fun to sit down with a friend and figure out the puzzles together. For the most part, though, I think it is perfectly great in solitaire.There were a few things that distracted from the fun of Roach. The first thing I encountered was the music. Early in the game, the music is so terrible that it was making me sick. There were bendy, modulated, sickly notes during one puzzle, so I turned it off. By the end, the music was better, but I did not listen to it most of the game just in case.Second, as with any puzzle game, it is very hard to get all of the clues fall within the perfect range of difficulty for a wide range of players. Journey of a Roach did a good job; in fact, most of the time, I realized later that there were subtle clues I missed. Nevertheless, there were a couple of times where I felt quite frustrated. Once, I looked it up after having spent thirty minutes on a single part of a puzzle, and it turned out that an idea I had thought might work but did not realize was actually doable (negative metagame thinking) was the right thing. In the end, this is a minor negative: that things that should be doable are not while others you might not expect are.Third, and this may be the biggest negative for me, the camera follows your perspective at all times. Oh, and you are a roach, remember? I am no entomologist, but it appears roaches can walk on walls and ceilings. If you are even remotely prone to motion sickness, …holy roaches, buckle up. I learned to squint, look away, or lay my head back while exploring certain parts of the game.All things considered, Journey of a Roach is a great game that does exactly what it sets out to do. If you are thinking about it, just buy it and have some fun."

,Recommended,255300,25382480,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,Nathan // Nudge,"The apocalypse has fallen, Nuclear War has wiped out all traces of human life, but deep underground inside a bomb shelter a host of mutated insects live on... Nope, this isn’t a new Fallout expansion, its Daedalic Entertainment’s Journey of a Roach! This comedy clicker sees the player take on the role of Jim the Cockroach, as he puzzles his way through laundry rooms, bars and ventilation shafts on a quest to save his cockroach pal Bud, so they can escape to the surface together and finally experience what life is like on the surface.Visually, the game is a real treat. Cutscenes use comic-strip style storytelling to advance the plot and despite it being released in 2013, the graphics have aged relatively well. Levels are varied and interesting and the cutesy cartoony characters are lovingly and humorously designed - from the war veteran wasp, to the old lady spider and everything in between. Much like Machinarium, the game has no dialogue, or so to speak. Characters communicate using speech bubbles with pictures hinting at what they want, and voices are an adorable mixture of buzzes, bu-be-dees and bo-bi-dos. Combine all of the above with a quirky soundtrack and the game simply oozes humour. It’s cheerful, charming and fun.Gameplay is presented in 2.5D style, which gives the rooms you travel through a great sense of depth, and much to my surprise – Jim has the ability to scale the walls and ceilings. This alone makes every room feel almost twice as big, and adds in a whole new dimension to puzzling and moving around. It can take a little while to get used to at first and in places it can be a little clunky, but in no time at all you’ll find yourself rather smoothly navigating your way around. It’s worth noting too, that the game offers full controller support for even more fluid control as you scuttle around the bomb shelter.Puzzles are fair to reasonable in the difficulty stakes, and some of the item combinations feel very reminiscent of Day of the Tentacle and other old school classics, which is always a good comparison. As the game advances you will run into a few trickier parts, namely a section involving a pylon and a beam of electricity – but on the whole, there isn’t anything too difficult here. Some of the puzzles are designed with the 2.5D/Climbing mechanics in mind too, so what starts out as a little novelty, soon becomes a core gameplay element – much like the ‘thinking with portals’ logic, you’ll soon be making sure you explore every ceiling as well as the floor to help you progress. It’s a pretty unique mechanic for the genre that, for the most part, is pretty well implemented.The game clocks in at about 3 to 4 hours in length for one playthrough, so it is on the shorter end of the spectrum – but that doesn’t feel like any sort of a hindrance. The story is funny, the characters are great, and the puzzles offer a good enough challenge. The little bit of time you’ll spend with Jim on his journey is well paced, and the game certainly never drags or outstays its welcome. There’s a little replay value here too for you 100% completion junkies - I’m not one for achievements myself, so I doubt I’ll be replaying it anytime soon, but for those of you that are, there are plenty in there that challenge you to not only replay the game, but beat it in 18 minutes. Let me know if you manage it!One thing I will point out though, is that considering the length - at £11.99 as I write this, JoaR is slightly on the pricier side, so you may want to wait until it pops up on sale to really squeeze your pennies for every bit of value.All in all though, Journey of a Roach is a short and sweet Point & Clicker that brings in some new twists on the age-old genre. There’s not too many developers in the world that I would say are always a safe bet, but in my eyes, Daedalic are one of them and they’ve delivered yet again with this cute-as-a-button, post-apocalyptic comedy. A good balance between fun and frustrating, solid gameplay mechanics and good design. It may never make it into the videogame hall of fame, but don’t let it pass you by entirely!For more reviews and recommendations then feel free follow my curator page here:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26020279-Pointers-Clickers/"

It's where the story both begins and ends.I'm not sure if you could say ""the creators poured their love into the game"".The art is nice and befitting of both the game and its genre as well as the beautiful background music.However that's where the game falls short: The genre.So Journey of a Roach is a Point and Click-Adventure with some puzzles that literally require you to randomly click around in order to find the solution.It is incredibly slow-paced. So much that you could actually say, it's stretching playtime.As for the story:The whole story is completed in less than 2 hours, if you've played the game before probably not even an hour.I approve of Indie studios making their own (maybe first) games, but there's so many better games out that it hurts my feelings to even have wasted 2 hours on this game.If anything you could say I did it for the art style.To sum up:The idea certainly is nice, so is the art, but as far as story telling goes, this game still has a lot to learn.If I'd have to rate it: 4.5/10"

While most of them are a little too text heavy and tedious, they are over all great games that are bringing back the point and click gaming era .Journey of a Roach however, is not a very good game. While the story line and game play are very innovative, actually playing the game is a different story.Since you are a roach, you can't talk and can climb on walls. After playing only 30 mins, I can still tell you that both of those points are a big issue.1. They use pictures instead of words as a guide.This is a problem just because i got very confused, very often.2. Climbing on walls.This would have been a cool feature if only the camera didn't get in the way. (Oh, that dreaded camera! You always have to ruin games for me...) Since the game was way too linear, the camera turned everytime you walked on the wals or ceiling to keep the prospective the same, but all it did was make me want to barf. That is literally the only reason I stoped playing the game. Games should make you queasy. Period."

The game has a simple structure - cut scenes, walking around discovering things and solving puzzles. That's not particularly modern game play, but could work if you occasionally enjoy an old-school adventure game.Unfortunately the puzzles are bad. E.g. at some point you have to assemble something to make a certain shape - you have some components to get to that shape. However the components you are supposed to use, clearly don't fit the shape - so you can't look at them and logically figure out which parts you need. Instead you need to keep trying nonsensical combinations until the game decides that now the components fit the shape - even though they clearly don't.

Recommended, though the shortness of the game may warrant waiting for a sale.Long story: I enjoyed my time with Journey of a Roach. The art style is a bit ugly, but whacky enough to be comical. The story is silly, but nice and often amusing. The puzzles consist almost exclusively of items and are generally unchallenging: the biggest challenge is usually finding the items. Once you have them it is usually easy to figure out where and how to use them. The ability to walk on walls is integral to some puzzles, both in getting close to items, areas and in approaching a problem from the right direction. This adds some extra flavor to what would otherwise be a standard point-and-click adventure game. Additionally, there are some collectables which encourage keeping your eyes open.The game is short. I finished it in around 2.6 hours according to steam and the game features an achievement for completing the game in 18 minutes. Personally I do not mind short games as much as games which drag it out longer than their story can support or purposefully waste your time.

Cute graphics, fitting music and sounds, adequate controls- but.But what? Well, let's see. All in all, Journey of a Roach has about everything a good adventure game needs. Even the story, told without one spoken word, is enjoyable in a no-worries fun way.Unfortunately, with just over 3 hours playing time, this game is way too short. In fact, it comes dangerously close to casual game territory (shudder). With the limited replayability value inherent to most puzzle games, that's a place it doesn't belong.It's a pity, really, because there's so much potential there. I hope to see a full size ""Roach"" adventure game in the future- this one is good, but some demos are longer."

76561197960931103,Recommended,255300,30451495,Posted: 11 March,all,caruch2001,"This is a short yet fun point and click adventure game. Playing as a roach allows you to climb on walls and even go upside down. This is the main mechanic of the game and is used heavily to progress through and solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves can be tricky but definitely doable.Graphics and sound wise it’s very charming. The world is fairly detailed and everything was very sharp even at 1440p. Different rooms may have different music or ambient noise. It all works well together. The cutscenes are animated in a cartoon style and are fun to watch. There is no text and no verbal communication. You rely on small picture hints when clicking or hovering over hot spots to understand what is going on.The controls are simply and intuitive. I played with a keyboard and mouse. One great control idea was to put the scroll wheel as one of the actions to bring down your inventory screen. It’s very natural to scroll down in order to…well…scroll down the inventory. I don’t remember that being in other point and click games, so it was a nice addition.Pros+60FPS+Cute characters & “voices”+Controls+Music+Art style & graphics+Fun and sometimes head scratching puzzlesCons+Short!My only wish is that the game was longer. It’ll only take 2-3 hours depending on how quickly you solve the puzzles. There is even a speed runner achievement for <18 minutes, if that tell you anything!A very well done game but the asking price of $15 is too much. Be sure to grab this on sale, you won’t be disappointed.7/10Good"

76561198095041903,Recommended,255300,34701254,Posted: 2 September,all,Charles Pendragon,"This is a case where I wish the had a mixed option for reviews, cause that's what I feel about this game. Most everything works fine, no bugs (well, not performance wise) or problems to speak of, controls operate fine for an adventure game, though there are some cases where changing crawling on wolls can get annoying, though not enough to really be a problem.The story is pretty minimal, Two roach friends go to find a flower (a rarity in a post-apocalyptic earth) and end up in a long misadventure due to the roach Bud's incredible bad luck, so his friend (the one you play as) has to save him, multiple times. Not much more than that without going into specifics, but it's a nice story.That gameplay is where I feel less than entertained. My main problem is that, for a few of the puzzles, there isn't much to go on and the vagueness of the explanation for the puzzles and items can make the puzzles less than clear, for instance. and spoilersAt the end of the game, you need to find a replacement for a button for a crane operating machine, there's a mushroom item that, when clicked on, shows a image telling you its a toxic, psychedelic mushroom, so you might think, ""Hmmm, do I have to try feeding it someone to make them do something, or distract them?"" But no, it's the button you need, and completely illogical given the nature of the machine as the buttons are not mechanical, but electrical.There's only a few other's like this (though for different reasons), but overall the puzzles feel sensible. I only had to look up answers three times. There is however an issue I take with arbitrarily limiting the player's movelent solely to make puzzles operate a certain way. You can only walk on select walls and objects to the left an right, but not everything, and walls on the background or foreground are completey unscalable. It's not technically problematic, but logically, it feels lazy. They could have at least given resoning to this.Besides that, to me, neither the story nor gameplay were too interesting or engaging to really be fun for me. An okay game with some overly vague puzzles, hence the mixed opinion, but I'll give it a thumbs up since it is done well overall.Also, it may say I only played a few minutes, but that's only cause I played on offline mode.Edit: Forgot to mention, as other's have said, I would not recommend this game at full price. I got it for 1$ U.S., and that feels about a fair price given the content, length, and replayability."
