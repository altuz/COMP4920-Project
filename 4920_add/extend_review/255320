76561198053133577,Recommended,255320,17036200,"Posted: 13 July, 2015",all,Yujah,"An updated review after having played the game to completion...Only buy this game if you are prepared to battle a few technical issues, but if so, thencertainlydo. And especially when on sale. Point & click fans should not mis this one: it's great fun.The tl;dr version: you will want to install the 7u79 Java 7 JRE and will if playing the English language version need to change to German for one of the puzzles (the kitchen menu one) and for the ending credits, but that's it. Steam-achievements worked fine for me with either language.For a bit more detail; it is as to the first and foremost technical issue as of 2015-07-14 likely that the game won't run fullscreen for you after initial install, presenting you with a white screen with sound only and no picture. This is a Java version mismatch. The first run of the game installs the very first version of the 32-bit Java 7 JRE (7.0.0), which at the very least on Windows 7 64-bit does not in fact work for this game.If you do not need a version 8 JRE installed for other purposes, it's easy to fix. Install the latest and last version of the 32-bit (i.e., ""x86"") Java 7 JRE manually; version 7u79, released 2015-04-14, at the time of writing available fromhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.htmlIf you allow the installation to remove the 7.0.0 version, running the game will reinstall it alongside again but it seems to in fact stillusethe new version. It for me runs fine after installing 7u79.You do currently need to not let the just installed new JRE7 subsequently update itself to JRE8; this at the moment installs the 8u51 JRE and will see the game return to its original white-screen behavior. This may of course have changed by the time you read this, but if not, I would advice to simply temporarily uninstall JRE8 for the duration of playing the game. Some 20 hours, that is.Note that if you insist on not even being offered the upgrade to JRE8 by the JRE7 you will find the relevant option in the Java 32-bit control panel to not stick unless you run it as administrator. If the account that you are running Steam and the game under has administrative rights, this consists of right-clickingC:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\javacpl.exeand choosing ""Run as adminstrator"". If you run Steam and the game under an unprivileged user account, temporarilygivethis user administrative rights, only to unselect automatic updates as per the above. And blame Oracle. You may or may not have to repeat this for the old 7.0.0 version as installed by the game and as found atC:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.7.0\bin\javacpl.exeAt this point you should be able to start enjoying a very good adventure game, fullscreen or windowed, and in either English or German.Unless you luck through it, it is likely that you will get the game stuck inside the kitchen-menu puzzle if you play the English language version. If so, Alt-Tab to your desktop, end the game by right-clicking it on the taskbar and restart in German. You can quit and restart in English again immediately after solving the puzzle. The English-language version of the ending-credits is also bugged currently; same solution applies.If you read to here, you're probably wondering if this game is worth the hassle. Yes, I would say it is. In fact, I consider the game an instant (not-)modern point & click classic. Be sure to check out the sequel, ""Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes"" as well; a more modern interface and every bit as entertaining."

Overall I had a lot of fun playing this game, but I can't bring myself to recommend this game to others.  The English version of the game has a couple game breaking bugs that will keep you from not only getting achievements, but, more importantly, also keep you from finishing the game.The good news is that within the guide section for this game someone was kind enough to post a patch that fixes both of those bugs.  Bad news is that that link is outdated and doesn't take you to the patch, but thankfully someone else posted a link in the comments which takes you to a different site that contains the necessary download for the patch.  Sadly, the game is still prone to problems even after you go through the trouble of downloading the patch and swapping out the necessary files.  I quickly learned to save after I did anything, because the game often crashes.  The game also has a problem where sometimes it won't start up properly (the music will play, but the window won't pop up or, if it does pop up, will simply show a white screen).All of those things can add up to a very frustrating experience when trying to play the game.  The main thing that kept me from simply calling it quits was the fact that the first time I played I was very close to the end before I experienced the first crash (and learned the importance of saving) and I wanted to know how it ended."

I had to switch to German language to get past this sequence after losing all my progress.

In fact, it is just so good, that something tells me that I have to write a review.So if you like old fashion point and click adventure, you will love this one!But enough of the glorification, here are the facts why it is so superb.As everything in the game, the story plot is weird, but in a really lovely way. Basically, you (Edna) and your little pyromaniac stuffed rabbit (Harvey) are trapped in an asylum and you have no clue why. So you have to find a way to break out and get your memories back. On your way you will meet a lot of crazy people, which are helping you out (one more, one less).The voice acting (just played the german version) is well and fits perfectly to the witty dialogues and its characters. Sometime you can hear that not all of the voice actors are professionals, but that's no big harm to the game. You can literally talk to everything and you will always get a unique answer. Even if you combine things, you will always get an impertinent comment. All is attended by catchy music. The puzzles are creative, but never unfair. At some parts I had to riddle for a while, but I've never really stuck or was forced to use the internet to get the solution. The game is basically divided into two sections. The first is bright, colorful and the pure joy of life. The second part is dark, morbid and almost serious. Especially the second part shows thatthe game is not made for young kids!But, no matter which part, both are detailed made with heart and fantasy.But, there are some downsides as well...The game crashes a lot. Because it uses Java underneath, it's doomed to perform badly. So the strategy is ""save early, save often"". The resolution is low and if you play the game in fullscreen mode, everything becomes a little bit blurry. Also the animation and drawings are miles away from being technically perfect. But on the other hand, if you know that the most of the game is made by only one lousy german student (now a cofounder of Daedalic), it starts to feel ""authentic"" and charming.ConclusionIf you are able to overlook the few rough edges its a 10/10.And beside that, if the game is on sale its a must buy for every p-a-c adventure lover."

The graphics are interesting and the story line is interesting too up to a point, but as I said not for me.  I did complete the game, but will not play any more of the Edna and Harvey series.Edit: Also forgot to mention that at one point you have to change the game in to German language to progress past a specific puzzle.

I think it gives it a certain charm, but your mileage may vary.You'll know if any of this is bound to turn you off.But listen, this game has HEART.Edna is your typical sociopathic adventure game protagonist -- and for once, you start your journey where that kind of character arguably belongs: a mental institution.You will attempt to break free with the help of your fellow nutjobs, and regain your memories and important life skills in flashback sequences.Edna is alternatively violent, silly and touching.♥♥♥♥♥♥gets pretty dark at times.That setting could be grating if done poorly, but I think Daedalic pulled it off.

Everything in this quest was beautiful – storyline, dialogues, characters, music and humor. And even despite some bugs, a few of which made me laugh. Of course, there were those that prevented me from passing the game, but I think it was because i was playing the game in Russian, with the help of a third-party cracker (because Steam didn’t include the official Russian translation into the game).So, i want to tell a little about this game – In this game the player must help the young strange woman named Edna escape from a psychiatric hospital. She will also be helped by her plush rabbit named Harvey. One day Edna wakes up in the hospital room. She doesn’t remember who she is and how she ended up in a room with soft walls. Harvey, who suddenly began to speak, becomes the best friend of Edna and they together make an attempt to escape from the hospital…This game about mentally ill people, friendship, and bad memories. This game is fun and sad at the same time. And, playing, I almost didn’t notice this border between my smile and a feeling of compassion for the main character.

All other point and click adventure titles should aspire to the greatness that is this game.If you love the genre, you should definitely play this game.It is however, not without its flaws. The interface is clunky at best and the game has at least one game breaking glitch, but if you look around online you can easily find a way to bypass it, like I did. The art style is also a bit crude and a couple of the puzzles are annoyingly difficult.But none of these complaints matter in the slightest.Gameplay is pure bliss.Minimal puzzles, maximum dialogue. Combine everything you have with everything else and get custom dialogue for all of it. Then click on everything in the background to see what Edna and Harvey say. THEN take all of the stuff in your inventory and combine them with all of the stuff in the background.The game devs thought of almost every possible combination of everything in the game with everything else and decided to reward us with custom dialogue for almost ALL of it. Now that’s dedication.I love this game SO much, but I do have one more tiny, niggling warning. If you played the game’s ‘sequel’ (“Harvey’s New Eyes”) before this one, you may not like the Breakout much.

The game has a lot of problems: poor resolution; unskippable animations; one game-breaking bug (in English version), and broken ending cutscenes (there are two distinct endings based on your final action). There is an unofficial fix available on the Steam Community that fixes the last two technical errors but, still, they should have official fixes by now and are totally unacceptable. Besides those points, the game is fairly solid considering it had such a tiny team was developed as part of a university thesis. The translation is also very good and I only noticed errors in some of the interface and achievements; the dialogue is flawless. It's a very solid adventure that feels quite similar (and pays homage to) the comical Lucasarts adventure games.  Although Harvey was getting on my nerves by the end, Edna is one of the most of likeable protagonists I've seen in an adventure game in some time. She is adorably bonkers and reminds me of Laverne from Day of the Tentacle. But that being said, and although I look forward to trying the sequel, the quality of the game (game-breaking bugs included) and the $15 price tag do not match up. If you see it on sale, though, for a few dollars (and locate the unoffical fixes before you start) it's probably worth it."

Combinations of objects that don't solve a puzzle each yield their own unique joke responses instead of a rote response like ""that won't work"". Furthermore, pressing the spacebar displays a list of all objects in the current screen which you can interact with, thus allowing you to spend your time actually solving puzzles instead of just pixel hunting.On the downside there are a couple of minor issues with the english translation as well as one major issue. A very small handful of captions and tooltips have been accidentally left untranslated, but this is not a serious problem. What IS a serious problem however is that in English language mode the puzzle where you have to tamper with the cafeteria menu may cause the game to lock up; it can only be reliably solved without problems by switching to German for the duration of that puzzle (which requires exiting and restarting the game)"

Without wanting to spoil to much: You're a girl held at a psychiatric ward and claimed to be insane, the obvious aim (glimpse at title) is to break out of the closed institution.

So I went into this game strongly predisposed to like it....but this game was actually kind of disappointing from the very beginning. I was expecting a followup to one of my favorite adventure games of all time (Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes). But this is actually a much older game with an older engine, and it doesn't even feature Lilli, the main character from that game.It also doesn't feature the endlessly apologetic narrator, whose epic dry humor was more or less the entire point of Harvey's New Eyes. It does still have classic Daedalic puzzle solving gameplay, once you get past the uber archaic interface (I have to click ""look"" and ""pick up"" and all that? Wow did we ever get past those buttons years and years ago.) Dialog and voice acting are good, too, although it doesn't quite have the bite that the newer Daedalic games have.The art is reasonable for an older game, but, much like everything else about it, it doesn't have that level of majestic polish that stuff like Night of the Rabbit or the Deponia series have.Basically, it feels exactly like what it is: an older game from the company before their age of greatness truly began. It's not bad per se, just ... ah, wow. I wanted a sequel. I really did.There's also the problem where this game has bugs. Massive amounts of bugs. Crash to desktop bugs. ""Go download an updated script file to properly solve this problem"" bugs. ""You can't win the game if you make this mistake"" bugs. Unacceptable and amaturish; I've come to expect more from Daedalic and not getting it is quite disappointing.Still, I enjoyed the game when it wasn't crashing, and played it through to the end without complaints. I probably wouldn't buy it again with full knowledge of what I was getting, but neither am I sorry I played it. It's on the razor's edge between recommended and not, but I think it's just barely on the good side of that edge.Overall rating, 3/5 (competent one-time experience but nothing exceptional)."

There's just one pretty serious glitch in the English patch that is mostly fixed by quitting, then going in to change the language to German, then solving the puzzle, then saving and going back to English if you can't understand German. The art is really unique, and the dark humor is a lot of fun. I really love the story and the unique characters, especially Edna. I find its commentary on the mentally ill to be pretty engaging, too.

Puzzles range in difficulty from 'put a thing on a thing' to 'run around the house turning on and off lights so they make a picture on the security monitor.'  The dialogue is hilarious, and at times heart breaking.  All in all, I have to reccomend this game.  Edna has an endearing insanity about her, and Harvey just adds so much flavor to this world, and I'm not even getting into the other characters.  Definitely take a chance on this one."
76561198054766153,Recommended,255320,18880394,"Posted: 4 November, 2015",all,blackenedwhiplash,"This is a hard game to rate. I like the story a lot and the characters are unique, but many of the puzzles need explaining. When playing this game, it's almost required that you have a walkthrough close by. You need to do certain combinations of actions in specific orders for some of the puzzles, and they're not always things that seem like the logical solution.One example is near the beginning when you've broken out of the cell and you're trying to evade the guard, there is a small column kind of furniture piece next to the door the guard is behind. You think you just need to push the column in front of it to buy you some time to run away right? Nope, just the column in front of the door isn't enough. You gotta search your inventory and choose specific objects to construct a contraption with the column that also immobilizes the door knob. You also have to do all this before the guard opens the door and catches you, which gives you very little time. Without a walkthrough, you could play this puzzle for hours, getting caught and restarting, to try to find this by trial and error. So sometimes the puzzles detract from the game.However, with today's technology and the ability to look up walktrhoughs, we have the means to move along. Now if it were a different game, I would probably take the constant use of a guide as a reason to forget the game and never look at it again. But the story is so interesting that I care more about what will happen next in the story than the puzzles. The voice acting is also something that adds interest to the game. I don't want to say the voice acting is good, though some of it is. But some character's voices are bad enough to be funny (like the voice of the aforementioned guard) and the conversations themselves are clever and humorous. This game has an irresistable charm and if the puzzles were more logical or if the game gave some sort of hint or guidance for the really odd ones, this game would be perfect.So do I recommend this game? I don't really know. I'm just going to leave my review positive because I still like this game despite its flaws. I bought the game on sale, so I'd recommend if you do get the game, you should wait until it's on sale as well."

Usually I get a since of accomplishment when I get something broken to work but lately I feel ripped off.  (Same thing just happened to me with a GOG version of Rayman.)  I don't think it's right that some games knowingly have vast amounts of technical issues and compatability problems and try to sell them (it's not like this is an early access game).  Even people who get this game to finally work complain about bugs and game breaking errors.   Daedalic should be embarrassed (of course why care when the money is coming anyway!).  Just know that you are taking a gamble when you buy this (game?).
,Recommended,255320,18660909,"Posted: 24 October, 2015",all,Mighty Pillow,"Oh Edna. Poor poor Edna. I felt so bad for Edna. I didn't expect to. I thought this game was going to be about a crazy woman breaking out of an institution. Well, it is. But it's so much more than that. Edna's life is funny, insane, and heartbreaking, and you learn about what led her to being sent to this asylum. You also learn about her best friend Harvey, though it wasn't mentioned where Harvey came from. The story is great, and all the people you meet throughout the game are great too.This game was longer than I thought it would be. Part of that was maybe due to the confusing tasks you had to do. I don't think I ever looked up a walkthrough to a game this many times before. Some of the things you had to do made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Also, this game has different ways of interacting with an item/person. Usually only one of those 'ways' will advance the game, even though in some circumstances 'use' and 'pick up' should mean the same thing. So to make sure I was exhausting all possibilities, I would 'use' 'pick up' 'talk to' most of the items around, which got annoying. I think the options should have been more general, i.e. 'interact', 'talk', etc. I also didn't like the way the inventory was done and how you hovered over it.I really liked the art style. Edna's appearance differed a lot, but I liked the way it was done. I liked that most of the dialogue was actually spoken. The voices were all done well.I encountered the kitchen glitch, but it was an easy fix by temporarily switching to German at that part.Buy buy buy!This game at least has a creepy atmosphere, but there are no jump scares (unless you count this one part toward the end where Harvey sees the dad in creepy scenes that come out of nowhere)."

The game was conceived as a Masters Degree project for the lead developer and has since been distributed as an official release.The game tries hard to be developed in the style of an older Adventure Game from the 90's.  The interface is just as clunky and uncooperative, the inventory is just as much a pain to open and close, and it is just as hard to interact with objects as it was for one of those games from the early 90's.  There are multiple ways to interact with objects and there is no easy way to pick and choose which one to use other than go through a clunky menu to find the interaction method or the object to use and then click on the object.  It does discourage mouse-searching or throwing objects at each other until it works because you don't want to have to work the interface, but alas - this is one thing adopted from the early era of the genre which Daedalic did not yet smother in bed.  I do appreciate how breaking down early adventure games with this release managed to give Daedalic the tools it needed to put together it's later games, but the mess you have to deal with in this game is just a pain.The story follows Edna who begins the game in a padded cell because she is obviously crazy and her only companion is her stuffed rabbit who speaks to her.  Her first task is to escape from the cell and go on to find out why you were locked up inside it in the first place.  The story is well written, and I was interested in finding out what happened to Edna, what's going on at the asylum and meeting the other inmates.  The dialogue is well written if a bit repetitive, especially if you are trying to find the answer to a dialogue puzzle, you may hear the same thing over and over again.  The translation is quality work, with only a little germenglish disrupting things.  I honestly didn't think too much of it and thought it a part of the asylum setting.I have no complaint about the puzzles other than the repetitive dialogue I spoke of above.  The difficulty ramps up gradually getting harder toward the end.  You do have all the tools at your disposal but finding the solution or making attempts is hampered by the clunky and annoying to use interface.At its core, this is a good game.  It is held back by how far it tries to emulate early adventure games from the 90's.  There is such a thing as being too retro where you not only duplicate what made these games successful and fun to play, but also annoying and difficult to use."

Sadly, I feel like E&H:TB pales slightly in comparison to HNY and the major bug I encountered in this game just made me unable to give this game my recommendation.My review of the game so far though, is that you are stuck in one (uninteresting) venue for far too long. I missed the thrill for adventure that I felt in HNY where I got to explore different and interesting places. I also felt like there is a lack of humour in this game compared to HNY, and the jokes that are there are quite dry. The puzzles are still relatively enjoyable, but there are definitely other areas that this game can improve on.Lastly, I don't usually complain about small bugs within a game here and there, but I've had COUNTLESS crashes midgame before finally encountering a major bug where I simply cannot continue the game. For a game that I would rate as mediocre, this flaw simply ruined any enjoyment I had with this game.As much as I would like to recommend this, I'd have to say The Breakout has been quite a disappointing experience compared to the developers' other works like Deponia.

I have to quickly hit enter in order to launch the game from Steam- A lot of unaddressed bugs, a few with community solutions that weren't even implemented by devs.This game is abandonware. It's full price is insanely high for what it delivers. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it if the price was 90% off, to be honest. The only people I'd recommend this to is for people who are die-hard Daedelic fans (I count myself among those people) who just want to play every single one of their games (but even I couldn't play this mess)."

If you are not a hardcore fan of point and click games (like myself) but you still enjoy them, this game surely delivers on many awesome things. All the caracters are funny and loveable, specially Edna, the story is really fun and will have you wanting to keep playing until the end of the game in one sitting. Graphics are ok I guess, it has its own style, you can tell by the pictures that it's not an artistic masterpiece but that doesn't affect the quality of the game. Finally the dialogue is very well written and will make you laugh many times.This game has a few cons though, it has almost none graphical options and a few technical problems, so save frecuently. Also if you are like me, and you get stuck and frustated from time to time you might want to check a guide for a few puzzles.Overall if you can pick up this game on sale/bundled it's definitely worth it, its a great fun story that you will surely enjoy."

Even when (notifbutwhen) one has to do it at a certain point due to a game-breaking bug in the English version, I heavily recommend opening the web page in a browser... and then going to windowed mode and dragging the window to the right so that you do not see the scrolling bar. Knowing at which point you are in the game is a major spoiler and should be avoided at all costs. A little tip for you, fellows. Let the insanity fully embrace you.The very game touches your heart in many ways through forcing you to make the decisions you normally tend to avoid. However, this psychological burden is remedied by hundreds of possible jokes whenever you try to combine (or freaking talk to!) different items of inventory. The developer has truly thought of everything. Very few games have such meticulous attention to detail. This game seems less polished in terms of look than the sequel, but the sequel feels... just likeasequel. This game might look sloppier but feels more affectionate.P.S. The final chapter had such a lasting impression on me so much that I wrote a polyphonic musical piece for a choir describing the events in a paraphrased way but later scrapped the lyrics and left it a standalone choral piece."

It is a very strange puzzle, also.

One of the endings does not even show the conclussion. I had to watch it on YouTube.Some achievements are very arbitrary and they substantially inflate the time you play.

The music from Deponia series still gets the trophies.Gameplay, here's there's something wrong, for me, again, at least. There's so much to do. I mean, you really have a lot of options and if you're not willing to see a walkthrough and you played a lot of point and click games, it's only natural that you'd think that each and any of the options could lead or link you to a solution. You can look, talk, pick up and use items. You can do that to so much sprites in the game and to each of the items in your inventory.If you're in for funny lines, this may be good for you 'cause even if you don't get anything from talking to a trophy or a water cup, you may laugh, if you're really into it.

That means if you want the deja vu achievement, you need to have it in german till the credits are done.Update: Originally I gave the game a thumb down, so the review has alot of negativeness to it. After I started using a walkthrough the game was alot more fun, because I could progress faster. It even made me have time to look at the achievements, and want to complete them all. Currently missing 4. The game is great, but it's so huge that the boring part was trying to find all the things to progress. My suggestion is to progress till you can't get further, and then just move over to a walkthrough. The game is worth completing!The original review:First of I love point and click games and I have already finished ""Edna and Harvey: Harvey's new eyes"", which I liked very much. To start of simple. This game is not even close to Harvey's new eyes.To make a long story short, I think there are only a few things that makes me go thumb down instead of up: Graphically it looks much cheaper than the other game, which is weird because it came out AFTER the first game. It doesn't even have any way of changing the resolution. Keep in mind that this is not something I would give thumb down for. I often play old games, and it's never really a problem as long as I have fun....And fun is the next problem. I like to complete games without a walkthrough, and sometimes it can be really timeconsuming, and requires a lot of patient. This game seems to be really confusing sometimes and very messy. I have played without walkthrough all the way, and it seems like I have unlocked most of the areas in the game at this point. The unlocked areas are now so wide, that I have problems with how I wanna spend my time. Sure I have some ""to do things"", but it sure as hell ain't that easy to find!So really. The game is great, buy it; especially if you don't care if you use a walkthrough or not (I might need one soon), but keep in mind that if you play it without it's gonna be really hard. It has been so far for me, but I'll give it a few more tries before using a walkthrough. And well that's one thing about this game. Search and you will find.

The gameplay is very basic, and everything you expect out of a point and click, and the story is decently  interesting and effective enough in its function, but this games absolute greatest strength is just how much character and charm it has. Character just gushes from every pore of this game through the wonky animations, the conviction of the voice actors and the details in the script. The dialogue alone will make you feel like you understand every character you interact with on such a bizzare and personal level, you feel odd remembering they were ever strangers to you. That being said, this game is flawed, in the story, the gameplay, the art, the pacing, the difficulty, and I really could go on, but this game has such an amazing amount of charm it would be an absolute crime to call it a bad game.
