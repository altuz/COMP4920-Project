If I seek rage, Super Meat Boy is a much better way to go.Here's how sequels should be made:In every aspect better than the original, while preserving the main idea.The art is much more polished, I feel much more comfortable without the pixel art.Instead of linear progression, the sequel offers you a 11*11 map for 121 rooms. You can try a different one when you are stuck at a specific room.More levels, less difficulty increment (Secret rooms are quite challenging, no worry for the game to be too easy)Level design have more focus on interaction with the mouse, thus more brain teasersIn short, Escape Goat 2 is a masterpiece."
,Recommended,255340,9631477,"Posted: 25 March, 2014",all,Metal Socks,"I played the first Escape Goat tons of times and this pretty much blows the first one out of the water. It adds a lot of new features while keeping some old ones, despite the new features being there for a few short levels. However there is a lot more to do in order to go through a lot of levels so there's more things to do rather than going through ten worlds and four extra worlds. There's a strange diffculty curve in some levels where you might spend ten minutes on one level figuring out what to do, then the next might take you two minutes. Either way the puzzles are interesting enough that you might even take some of them on in different ways, rather than going through what the game intends you to. The graphics are way better than the first, moving from pixel graphics to fancy drawn graphics and neat little idle animations. Soundtrack is also really amazing. If you liked the frist Escape Goat, you'll really love this sequel. If you haven't played the first, then I'd really recommend just moving onto this one, since there's nothing much to miss on the story."

I got stuck on the snake skeleton stages but after picking it back up a day later, made it through. Now I'm working on completion, which is where the real challenge lies.Do I recommend it? Hell yeah I do! I'm a Nintendo/Atari kid so this game was great times all around. It took the formula that we grew up with as gamers and tweaked it to magical hat perfection. I will say this though, even if you plan on going for 100%, the game is pretty short. a game reviewer stated that it took 2 hours to complete, but for me it was closer to 3.5. I can allegedly be done in under half an hour. Can't wait to see the speed runs! Buy this game and support the indie scene.

The game also (SPOILERS!!) do implement some new features, and is significantly larger than the first game. So i am changing this to a recommend. My stance on the graphic withstands none the less.Stay clear!! If you own the original Escape Goat, don´t buy this. If you don´t own the original, buy that instead of this downgrade.By all means an inferior game than the original Escape Goat, which i absolutely adored. From what i can concern, there is absolutely no new features what so ever. Calling it a sequel is actually misleading, since it´s the exact same game but with LESS content. You read that part correctly, Escape Goat 2 is LESS of a game than it´s predecessor. Why? Because the developer (s) removed the Level Editor! The original boasted an easy to use, yet extremely powerful level editor that allowed you to create anything the original campaign could offer. You could even create your own campaign by chaining the levels together. Escape Goat 2 have no level editor what so ever.That´s right, they removed the ONE feature that allowed a wonderful community to grow up around this game. Maybe they realised that a level editor would make any DLC obsolete. Worse yet, well no not worse, the omission of the level editor is the main offender, but the new graphics aren´t really up to snuff.The original had pixel perfect, atmospheric and gorgeous sprite art. The sequel is still made out of sprites, but it is all convoluted in an unnecessary comic look. The original had a sense of mystique, an omnious almost gothic vibe. This game looks like your random, kid friendly iOS game. To add insult to injury, the lightning effects obscures the playing field. It´s not always clear what is what, and while it certainly ain´t no big problem, the new graphics diminished the enjoyment of the game, at least in my case. It´s also unnecessary demanding! The first game i could run on my MacAir with perfect framerate and hardly any CPU usage. This game chugs even at the lowest graphics setting, and is setting my fan on fire.So there you go. Take a game with a wonderful premise, because the basic gameplay behind Escape Goat is truly amazing, disguise it in less beautiful and more demanding graphics. Remove half of the content. (One could argue the level editor was more than half really), and up the price. And there you have it folks. Escape Goat 2."

Once I knew which rooms they were in, I found the difficulty fine. But there really was no in-game clue to where they were, other than the hole in the map, which was often bordered by several rooms.Now that the criticism is out of the way, let me just say the difficulty progression, level design, puzzles, visuals, etc are all great and I highly recommend this game to anyone who ever played the Adventures of Lolo as a kid."

It's essentially the same as the first game but with vastly improved graphics, new abilities for the mouse and with bonus levels extending from the branches of the previous levels. There is probably a different ending at the end of it all. This has a lot of value, buy this game, it's worth it even at full price.Also check this link for a taste of the game's feel:http://z0r.de/6313(epilepsy warning)"

The developer managed to pull off only improving the original game, with more content added and quality of life changes, all while staying the same game it was. It's a must if you enjoyed the first one."

So much that after buying it on another service, the Steam Awards reminded me of it and I decided to buy it again! (Pardon the minimal time-played-as-of-writing-this.)Excellent pacing of introducing mechanics while keeping the puzzles challenging. Level editor is just icing on the cake."
,Recommended,255340,25287253,"Posted: 1 September, 2016",all,Jonman[GWJ],"Puzzle-platformers are a dime-a-dozen. *Great* puzzle platformers are rare. Games starring a goat are even rarer.Which makes Escape Goat 2 a rare beast indeed. It is an *excellent* puzzle-platformer, predominantly because it feels so novel. It doesn't resort to the same hackneyed puzzles that you've solved a hundred times before. The suite of mechanics, which are steadily drip-fed throughout the game, provide scope for truly surprising puzzles with solutions that might well make you giggle and clap your hands when you figure them out.Fair warning, it gets hard. The difficulty ramp-up is steady, but the game leads you in gently. The latter half of the game will challenge (and probably frustrate) you, while still being solvable, albeit after 15 minutes of staring the screen and shaking your head."

I'll keep things short and simple.Great mechanics.Controls well.Amazing sprite and animation work.Awesome OST.Gimmicks and puzzles involving said stage gimmicks are unique, interesting, and/or at the very least not annoying.Speed runner friendly.Lots of secrets.Best Use of a Farm Animal.If you like puzzle platformers you will enjoy Escape Goat 2."

I had to go through a lot to beat that, dedication and focus.. the glass rooms can't even come close to the first games extra stages, I was looking forward to the hard content and was highly dissapointed.All that being said, it's still a very solid platformer, controls cleaned up, graphics improved, feels less 'slippery', good music and theme.. the level design could use some work here and there, but my only major complaint is the lack of any really hard content."

The short bits of dialogue are charming and the overall game is laid out really well. I do find that there is a sudden spike in difficulty in some levels, but it's never so discouraging as to stop. The solution is almost always clear and it's just a matter of pulling it off. Overall a great little puzzle game."

There are multiple ways to complete several levels, each way offering different challenges to overcome. It's not a very long game, but there's enough exploration to keep you busy for a while. The aesthetics, graphics, and abilities all work perfectly together."

Beating it ain't too hard and is quite fun.What really elevates it is the slick controls that make sense and that the puzzles and the mechanics also make sense.Recommended if your in the mood for a good puzzle platformer.
