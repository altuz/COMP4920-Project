Graphics in the vids looked cool and a flat-rate buy-in with no subscription in the future to play!Now I see there is no future. The game seems pretty much dead. I don't think I've seen any updates since last October, but you don't have to quote me on that because I don't know... it's such an uninteresting game that I quit caring.The biggest thing right off the start was the ""2D Navigation Map"" yep... 2D. And you won't find it Highlighted in ANY of the screenshots on the StorePage. But you know that one bright picture, of the Orange Sun, asteroids, and ships flying in; well you see that ONE picture ALL THE TIME as the loadscreen.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=376160681So you spend 80% of your time on this 2D map, loading in and out of EVERY little thing. So you get that picture all the time as you engage any enemy, mine, change sectors (which you have to do constaly), enter a Station's Space (instance), enter a station, leave a station, leave the space, 2Dmap, fly around in this little retro feeling cutesy version of the game you thought you were going to play.Combat, well that was disappointing to during my short and uneventful tries playing. Any time you want to engage in combat (or mining) you have to load in to the instance from the 2D map, and the space is Small. The Space Box looked real pretty, but the ships felt like logs in space and almost always (at the time) the Ai would just fly in circles. Literally Circles, you'ld get close fire and it would turn into the most disappointing space combat you can imagine. The kind where you constantly excellerate past each other, firing wildly, just missing ships, then you both flip around and pass each other in the other direction. If it's too much, you just fly away; either to the edge of that rendered space (before loading out to the 2D nav map,) and turn around, or just fly off to ""warp away""... lame. After a bit you really just get irritated and so you stop moving, which seemed to confuse the AI for a bit. Then you basically play space turret and just spin around shooting at the AI. kill them get some items and return to the 2D navmap... real uneventful. Even the mining was tedious and consisted of no more thanmoving near some asteroids and hitting them with a colored laser. Area's with Enemy AI could be avoided, or you could eneter and simply avoid the circling AI at the center of the instanced-space.I could go on and on. Basically, there is NOT as much bad*ss space fighting as you'ld like. It's a heavily ""instanced"" game, meaning it loads into EVERYTHING> it is NOT SEEMLESS. The one apparently fully functioning mechanic is trade, but AI trade. You basically run around chasing automated but ""random"" shiftes in the AI market buying goods at low prices and trying to make it back in time to sell somewhere else. If you are a SUPER cash/trade managment player you may enjoy it. But really you'll hop on that 2D map too and immediately feel like you just wasted 20$, even if it is ""perminet access"". 'Cause you will spend ALL that running around time on that damned 2D map. It really does feel like a classic ""bait and switch"". You pay for the game shown in the vids and screens, but you get to play this ""other"" game of 2D map flight about 80-90% of the time. There are better games to play if trade is really your thing. SO MANY OTHERS!SAVE YOU CASH, LOOK ANYWAY ELSE. Buy Kerbal Space Program on sale, or Any of the New Gen Space Games, or Nexus, Sins of a Solar Empire, AYTHING other than this. PLay Star Trek Online for FREE!!!!! I swear you'll get tons more hours of better, although sometimes clunky, gameplay out of that than you will on this.Also... it appears the online comminity is really dead. There was barely anyone on when I tried and almost no one now. Seriously you can get on and play an MMO alone.My last minute advice if you still feel like you want to buy this: DON'T.Watch videos of the 2D nav map, then consider that's about 80% of your gameplay right there."
,Not Recommended,255500,16049785,"Posted: 28 May, 2015",all,Resonant Drifter,"So, ArtPlant decided they would put a couple of devs on this game and continue work on it very slowly. They have a rough plan listed in the forums, but who can actually tell if they are following it or not. The first thing in that list is ""Solo gameplay"" but this gameplay is still largely broken. In a new, vague update they state they are working on ""the ability to intercept other players in fast travel and minor pirate gameplay improvements"" which isn't solo play at all.There are things have been changed in the game such as some graphics and mission boards, but seriously it's all broken right now. I just tried again to play the game with a brand new character and the game constantly ""hiccups"" and lags. I tried doing a mission from the mission board and there were no rewards. In fact, all of them were fetch missions but I had no idea where to fetch the item from. I tried to follow the tutorial but, even though I had a fighter, it wanted me to mine an asteroid stating a laser works best but all I had on my ship was a projectile firing railgun and missiles that I couldn't fire. After shooting at the asteroid for a couple of minutes and fighting the lag which was causing my ship to jerk around, I just quit.It's sad to say after all the years fighting to keep this game alive and pushing the devs to continue development, this game is a buggy, unfinished mess. It could turn around at one point, but why waste your time and money. There still are only a couple people playing it according to the stats (you never see them online) and even the devs don't know when the game will be finished (by their own admission). There are other games out there, and more to come. I'm done waiting and wasting my time.// - - - OLD REVIEWAbandoned.I bought this game about 2 years ago because it looked like a great Freelancer-esque game and it was. Things seemed like they were developing nicely, but now it's dead in the water.One big debate was a 2d map travel system (which you don't see in the videos except for 2 seconds) which was voted out for full 3d by the users. This took some development time away from the game and apparently they lost motivation to work on the game and, by the Devs own admission, they thought about scrapping the game altogether. Over a month ago they said they would continue work on the game with a smaller team but haven't released any updates or intention in the forums. It's been over half a year since an actual game update was released. Current game is bug ridden and largely unplayable plus has only a handful of players (literally, I think five people play the game).So much potential, but as of now it's all lost. DO NOT BUY."

I can't seem to complete any missions beyond the tutorial. I get pirate kill missions and don't get credit for any of the kills. I did ""find thief"" missions and no one could find where sectors 1 - 5 were. All the space traveling is done in a 2d birds eye view, which I am not a fan of. This game is extremely instanced and each instance is very small. I hit loading screens every 3-4 minutes on average. I tried using my saitek x52 pro and there seems to be no joystick support. I think this game may be fun in the future but at this time I feel like I purchased this game thinking it was something else than it is."

Existing players were able to exploit bugs in the game to trade up to the top level of ships and weapons. They could not be attacked whilst trading. Then the developers turned on pvp for all new ships from high level players. The only efective way to build credits to upgrade your ship is to trade. if you trade any player can simply fly past you and take your goods with a couple of button clicks destroying your ship. There is no place you can go no skill or option you can use to prevent this. it takes many hours to build up trading credits and goods it takes seconds to be put right back at the beginning. If this happens you are best deleting your character and starting again as you will then at least get starting credits again.Mining , salvage parts of game are redundant. Rolling a pvp ship to begin is also redundant still get killed 1 -2 shots outside your range by a ship that i faster than you and beins the pvp session directly behind you ship.I have never sees a worse setup to ensure griefing of new players in many many mmos i have played.Also there are only three quests in the chain followed by pointless and broken find a theif. and pirate killer missions.You can be ganked whilst trading, you can even jump into a quest instance of another player and gank them.This game is setup for children who like to walk around the playground with their gang stealing from everybody else. nothing more.Worst most boring mmo ever i've wasted my time thinking this would be a new 'elite' or fun space  trading game.Last but by no means least the game constantly has issues on combat / quest loading screens meaning you often go into combat but cannot see the screen.Way to go Entropy beta / alpha or not one of the worst implemented mmos ever. Wooden spoon of the year maybe the decade.Played the game to level 5 and 10 million credits as i was lucky to get in before they turned the griefing on. I could buy a top level ship now but am leaving anyway as the ethics of this game are so poor now i see new players come and pretty soon leave in disgust after being ganked in starting space repeatedly laughed at and told to learn to play by the rude and offensive existing player base.Can't believe i actually parted with money as well as my time for this. A 2d space game in 2014 wow way to go this would be poor by the flash / web / mobile game standards."

This is early access, so there's going to be a lot of bugs and features that just simply aren't created yet.With that said, this game popped up out of nowhere and is a pleasant surprise. Imagine if Freelancer & EVE Online had a kid. In fact, my first impressions of Entropy feels like an open world Star Conflict with mining & trading.There are a lot of quirks with the combat, system travel, trading, etc. and it will take a bit to get used to. For instance:There is a lot you have to figure out for yourself. You simply can't right click on an object and get info for it right now. Flying around sectors needs an overhaul. I see what they are trying to do, but moving around on a 2D plane just takes me out of the game - but thats how you get to places. Everything takes place in little zones and you can't exactly explore to your hearts content, as you are unable to go outside of the ""grid"". There are tons upon tons of loading screens. Everything you do = loading screen. They just released a patch that has made loading significantly faster, but I wish that there was less 2D traveling/cutscenes and more space.All in all, Entropy is a nice little surprise before Christmas. I recommend it to anyone who, like me, got a big Egoshaft up their *** from X Rebirth. It's simply a whole lot more fun, surprisingly polished for Early Access, and takes the edge off of waiting for Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous."

As a merchant, you start off with a ship that handles like a brick that is drifting in space. All you get are a couple of crappy laser guns, and you are off, fighting enemies, selling vaccines, and doing stuff.After a few missions, I found myself noticing how slow and long winded and just plain boring the game was, and found myself bored and frustrated.The game is so boring, that I literally found myself rolling cigarettes and making sandwiches while I wated for my ship to fly from being in-view of a station to at the door of the station.I decided to try another character, and this time went with a survival/combat guy. I was given a slightly faster ship, but it looked practically identical to the slow cargo ship I had been given as a merchant. Furthermore, while the top speed of the ship was slightly higher, it still handled like a brick drifting in space.With the combat ship, I was given a few guns instead of the two lame lazers you get with the cargo ship, but for some reason, I could kill enemies easier with the lame lazers than with the big combat guns. For some reason, they just did not do as much damage.It seems that whatever you start off as, merchant or fighter, you will have slow unresponsive controls. Also, you will go through the exact same tutorial.I have not played much at the time of typing this, and I will be checking back in from time to time to see if things improve, and if they do, I will come back and edit this post, but for now, I can't even stand to load the game up and see it.It is slow, boring, and frustrating. However, it is more than just that, the problems are much more fundamental and deep rooted.Here are the negative things that I have noticed:-It is not an open single world, it is divided up into instances that need to be loaded. I understand that space is big, and you can't have loads of solar systems all in one world, but they have not only divided it up by solar system, they have also divided it up by whatever is in each system. Instead of load a solar system and fly from 1 planet to another, you load a solar system, then load a planet, and if you fly too far away from the planet, asteroid belt, ship, or whatever else you are near, you will come to an orange floating grid, that if you go beyond, will take you back to the main menu for what part you want to load.-Not only does the ship handle like a drifting brick, but the controls have been designed by a madman, because nothing is where you would expect it to be, and it just feels very uncomfortable and awkward to move.-The loading menu, has been disguised as a 2D top view of your ship flying around the solar system. So instead of just choosing what instance you want to load, you have to fly there very slowly.-You can fly directly through the sun or planets, and it does not blow you up or do anything to you, this does not seem like a bug either, it looks like its just how its going to be. When you are in the weird flying around slowly choosing what instance to load menu, you can't crash in to anything, suns, planets, ships, whatever, its all without mass.-The user interface and writing are so small that you simply can't read it. I have this loaded on a large 32'' screen, and no matter what resolution I put it at, all the writing is about size 6px.-It is too organge. From the logo to the UI, there is orange all over the place.-There are giant chunks of information that are just missing, with most of the things being unexplained.-The whole system is totally over complicated for the sake of being over complicated. For example, if you buy a new gun for your ship. First you have to buy the gun, then it will get moved to your warehouse menu. Once this happens, you can open your warehouse and then your ship cargo and drag it over, and once you have done that, you can drag it from your cargo to the slot you want to equip it on.This means you can end up buying things to trade, only to spend ages slowly flying bored out of your mind to sell them for peanuts, just to discover you left them in your warehouse anyway, and have to fly all the way back again.-A whole load more that I wont bother boring you with.How anyone can have the guts to ask for money for this is beyond my understanding. I rather give the cash to a beggar on the street, and at least get the feeling of having helped someone in return.Buying this game is like paying to be arrested so you can be made to wait for bail.Overall, I give this one a 2/10 at best. Lets see if it improves with time."

For I cannot reccomend it nor can I dismiss it.So, here goes my updated review after about 4 months.Entropy is another space based MMO.  The developer, ArtPlant has done space games before in the iteration of BattleStar Galactica Online, a browser based dog fighting space game.  Entropy is trying to be like that but on a much grander scale.  2 years ago, when this came to Steam, Entropy had a 2D map that you would fly around and players absolutely hated it.  There was zero immersion.  After constant complaints from the player base, Art decided to scrap the 2D map and create a fully 3D experience.  The only loading screens would be when you docked, undocked and flew to the next system.  The map itself isn't very big.Doing things like updating the map to 3D took several months.  About 4 to be exact.  During this time, ArtPlant didn't communicate with its playerbase like, at all.  People would ask in the forums what was going on but the dev's stayed tight lipped.  Around October of 2014, after 4-5 months of zero communication, the player base basically said ♥♥♥♥ it, and left.  Everyone assumed the project was dead.  This, righ there, is the epitome of a bad developer.  This company has spent almost nothing on advertising.  I think I've seen one or two adverts for Entropy online while I was perusing youtube.  Those ads lasted all of a month then poof, nary an ad.Finally in late 2014, after zero communication, ArtPlant decided to chime in and posted an update on the state of the game.  They said they spent alot of money updating the 3D map and were going to move onto other problems with the game.  They really didn't want to update the map but felt like the player base hated it so much, that it would affect the sales of the game....which it did.Fast forward to the beginning of 2015 and Art is running out of patience.  A post is made declaring that the dev's are thinking of♥♥♥♥♥♥canning the project.  They spent alot of time and money on the map and were considering ending it.  After this post was made, most of the remaining playerbase flew into a rage and flamed the company.  This is why, today, at the time of this review, there are literally 0 players playing this online.  I jumped in tonight to check out the updates and I was the only one.  Noone in chat.So most of 2015 was wasted on God knows what.  They released a few updates in late 2015 (if memory serves) and did a complete wipe of all player ships in late 2015.  So when I logged in, my ship and all its modules were missing.  You pretty much had to start over even though ArtPlant said there would be no wipes during development. But hey, its early access so whatever.That is just a brief history of the dismal development that Entropy has endured in last year and a half.  This is testament to how terrible Art is as a developer.  They talk to their player base....finally!  Most of the old players are gone, maybe a handful still read the forums on steam and keep up to date with development.  Art has managed to fix alot of the problems that plagued the initial release, such as trading being pretty terrible, and finally a crafting system.  As of this review, while in early access, I would say DON'T buy Entropy due to the development cycle of the past year.  Art is indeed releasing more constant updates, but I still wouldn't want someone to lay down 20-40 bucks for an early access game that may never finish.There are a few die hard players still around but they almost never log in and play.  If you check steam charts, you will almost always see 0 players playing this bare bones space game.GameplayGameplay consists of accepting missions from the mission board in a station, then un-docking and flying to a pre-determined area in the next system.  This feels alot like Eve online here.  While traversing systems via a gateway, sometimes you will run into randomly generated pirate gangs. This is kind of neat, and breaks the tedium.You can also mine asteroids with just your weapons.  You don't need to equip a special mining laser.  This is also nice.  Trading is just like in every other space game.  You haul goods from one station to another and hope to find a good route.  Since there are only like 20 systems, this isn't that hard.  Nothing extrenous like Elite Dangerous for example.  I haven't dabbled in the crafting yet.  I almost never do crafting in any MMO.  Crafting to me is extremely dull.  You equip modules on your ship just like in Eve and Elite Dangerous.  Not going over your capacitor is key.  So bigger ships can carry more of a payload.So there you are.  Make up your own decisions from the previous reviews.  Some of them are pretty pathetic and don't explain that much.  Don't pay too much attention to reviews written before December 2015 as those were before Art was releasing more consistent updates and was basically not talking that much to the community, so the community was peeved."

You ran off all your players..  and there are too many negative reviews for people to try to buy the game.  that and the 11 players in the servers every day isnt exactley a community...  So free to play is the only way you guys have even a shot now.  too late on the updates and too much lack of interaction with your player base so we would know what was going on.  I'm a founder btw.

,Not Recommended,255500,9407237,"Posted: 9 March, 2014",all,=]DI[= Syklone,"Sadly I do not recommend this game, several reasons is it is not a true Space sim, more a combined 2D / 3D hybrid pseudo simulator. Which the screenshots do not reflect of what you are really seeing.The game starts off great for an alpha, but then after looking at a 2D map for a majority of you time traveling around the universe you soon realize you are cheated a space sim, and are just given some 2004 recreated game with shiny 'orange' graphics. In short, its pirates of the 7 seas hosted in space with some small 3d shoot outs included. And when I mean small, I do mean small, combat is limited to short range dog fighting where I found myself sometimes bumping into the other ship. Not really dog fighting but more 'get as close and blast first' to win.The devs did make progress with missions and cleaning things up, but what killed it was the devs have decided AGAINST making a 3d map/space instance of the game but having a 2d travel map (with ice skating) mixed with 3d instanced zones. This is a buzz kill as you lose a lot of tactics in 2d as there is no X Y Z and just a chess board field to skid on.Since this news has been released I decided it’s not my cup of tea and have found other games more entertaining and worth value over this. I would strongly recommend looking at other games that are on the horizon over this game if you are looking for a real 3d space sim as I find this game will not become the space sim people are looking for."

After months of just ignoring it because my first attempt at playing the game was well bad. It didn't get any better, it even got worse.The interface is in my opinion unfriendly, compared to was is done these days.Last time I played I could at least fire my guns, this time around for some reason it just didn't work and it's technically pretty simple: left click to fire cannons. But they just wouldn't work even if I have 3 shiny activated cannons. On top of that my energy level won't recharge even if I have 'Rapid Charge Energy Bank' on my ship. They look pretty pointless now, even if when I look at the stat of my ship it DOES have a positive energy recharge (bug?).An other thing is travel in painful, so as I mentionned before guns don't work. Which I found out once I had two npc on my back. Since my guns din't seem to work I decided to bug out to try to figure out how to make my gun work after about 5 minutes of trying to do it with the NPCs on my back. You see there's a fast travel option in the game. This option make you go about 20 times faster then normal. Which is sadly still kind of slow, it will take you a few minutes to get between points on fast travel. But the thing is fast travel will disable as soon as you ship gets hit. So it there's NPCs on you and your guns won't work (in normal case you could run out of ammo, in my case they just didn't work at all). There is nothing you can do except maybe fly for a few hours to get back to the station or self destruct.So basically it was a very bad and frustrating experience.This game is simply horrible."

A side mission I took there's zero guidance on how to complete it because the mission tracking feature doesn't work. There are frequent game crashes or game blocking bugs. It almost seems as if you spend more time in loading screens (because they are very frequent) or animation sequences than you do actually playing. I'm not fond of travel mechanics. The ui needs serious work. (small text, can't move anything around) Reloading mechanics are kind of a joke.

Ever heard of it?  Why do we need this one to go that route too!?  This game already has a solid foundation for 3D combat and flight mechanics.  Lol c'mon!Here are the following ways Entropy will defeat EvE as a tactical space simulation (it won't):-No way in hell-Absolutly not-I would rather go play eve.-Eve makes the tactical gameplay somewhat enjoyable, this does not and the 2d map makes it worse.Here is how Entropy will defeat EvE as a flight simulation in full 3d space:-Combat from the pilots perspective-Enough appeal to the pilot to pull them away from eve-Trade/mine and travel in full 3d from system to system from the pilots perspective.-Feel immersed in the world, looking out your cockpit as you travel.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goy3iTV0xR8Eve has the server population already and will never be defeated in the tactical space simulator world.  Just the same as WoW reigns supreme to this day in the realm of Themepark MMO's.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqb-m1ZZUAThe only thing Entropy has over EvE is the 3D combat, and when I have to hit two loading screens and jump in and out of a 2d map, it just RUINS it for me.I've got 400 hours in Entropy, but all with the back of my mind telling me ""maybe one day they will get rid of this 2d map"".

Also the the development team is active and responsive for most part.  this is not a polished or even beta game so dont play it if you expect something that works as intended. the basic gameplay works and the game is very much in need of ways to keep the player entertained as for right now you can mine salvage do kill or transport missions with only minor issues such as infrequent disconnects. the community thus far is great folks are helpful friendly and many of us are eager to see where the game goes.  however at this time you spend much play time in a 2d map which needs some sort of flare added to it to keep it interesting.overall the game is unique and has a lot of potential i give it a no due to the fact that is still early accsess and you should not play it expecting a fully functional game... however if you want to help test give input and get involved with a exceptional alpha i give it 431.5 thumbs up

They either had no idea what an Alpha consists of or just didnt bother to ask any of the very helpful people who play regularly! I believe you have to put time into something to really find out what it is like.)Entropy is in earlyAlhpastage of its game design - with three Tiers to choose from, Colonist £14.99, Explorer £29.99 or Founder £75.99 - Each with its own merits as stated before purchasing. It is an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) so you will encounter other people.I was sure I wanted to have a half decent start so opted for the 2nd Tier (Explorers Pack). I had read on google that the top two tiers would allow you to carry over any stats, items and money (Credits) earned to the the full launch edition.To start - There is a 2D System view and a 3D view. You manouvre your ship in the 2D view (Imagine Mass Effect) and then enter specific Instances for 3D view.The game works by using these ""Instances"" to allow you to fly in 3rd person (3D) which gives you full control of your ship. These instances are sometimes random (Interceptions by Pirates) or you can choose to enter an instance by flying close to a marker (Asteroid belt, Space station or Jumpgate) on the 2D system screen and selecting ""Enter"" with your mouse.You will see on the 2D map you can enter space stations in certain systems which enable you to Trade (Marketplace), buy modules (Ship upgrades), increase your own stats (Piloting, trade etc). There a few other things but as this is Alpha they are not yet implemented (Friends list, Cartel/Guilds)When you start, there are a few missions - basically the games missions are not finished and as such you find yourself asking ""what do I do now?"".  The idea of a sandbox/open world game is that there is not a linear line of ""do this, then do that"".  After you complete or in some cases don't complete the early missions, you have a choice of Mining, Salvaging, Trading or Combat (Only Combat gains you XP at this stage).Mining - This is basically a case of equip/buy a mining beam, fly to the Asteroid instances and then target certain asteroids to mine there resources.Salvaging - Same principal as Mining but with ruined/broken ships/drones.Trading - This is simply ""Buy low and sell High""Combat - The instances with combat contain NPC's (Non player PvE). You can also be intercepted by other players (PvP). Currently the only way to level up your character is to enter combat. There is no fixed cap on level progression that anyone is aware of.The game is extremely basic in its present form but has lots of promise, its visuals are great, the gameplay is still being tweaked and it can be very annoying sometimes to get stuck in a bug (which are being removed or worked out) and then have to Alt-F4 which exits the game completely. Imagine Eve Online but in a dumbed down easier to understand format.I have put in a few hours so can say that the game is worth a shot if you enjoy the sandbox type game, for me it is relaxing and can be a challenge if you want it to be - especially if you choose to fly pirate.I hope to see this flourish into a decent MMO and become a classic!"
,Recommended,255500,10520124,"Posted: 18 June, 2014",all,Connman,"So first off, yes the game is still very, very early in alpha stages. However, it is still a playable and enjoyable game and has loads of potential. This is the best space rpg game I've seen since Microsoft's Freelaner (still the best by far, even after more than 10 years). The gameplay is for the most part a good balance between a complex dynamic economy (similar to EVE) and the relative simplicity of combat and manual ship navigation (such as Galaxy on Fire 2). Be warened though, this game has a truly massive learning curve, and besides the downright pitiful intro tutorial, all they give you is a ""pilot's manual"" which is way too wordy for anyone to read. So if you do decide to dive in to this game, be sure you have more than enough pacience to do so. If you need help, the best way to get is just to ask the other players in global chat, they'll help you out.This game advertises itself as an MMO, but right now in the early stages there is nothing massively multiplayer about it. It's a good day if we get more than 10 players online (there is only one server for the US), and even then becasue of the vastness of space it is unlikely you'll stumble across anyone. The lack of a good system for players to trade goods and credits between one another is also a glaring flaw in the game's social ecosystem.While the gameplay is good for the most part once you get the hang of things, there are a couple snags worth mentioning. Navagation though space is based on a 2D map. You use this map to navigate your ship to certain instances, such as stations or asteroid fields, where you enter a 3D interface (the one shown in the screenshots) and fight other players or bots, mine asteroids, etc. This 2D map, sector based gameplay can be a little boring at times, although I've heard rumblings that the dev's are going to replace it sometime soon. Once again, this game is only for people who have the patience and time to deal with it.Now on to some good things. The graphics of the game are great when in 3D space and combat, while sparse, is involved and engaging. The complex and dynamic economy allows for trading to be very profitable, and there is also a large variety of tradable goods. For those who have been looking for a good space rpg it more than delivers.Bottom line, it's a solid game, but with much room for needed improvements. I would recomend this game to anyone who has the patience to tackle the learning curve and the at times slow gameplay. Don't be silly though, just buy the $20 colonist pack. All explorer and founder do is give you some slightly modified versoins of ships that are available to everyone in game, and a small amount of extra credits, of which you can earn twice as many trading comodities in an hour. This game isn't worth more that $20 right now."

(Took them only an hour on last patch to solve 2 major bugs)Currently implemented- mining- salvaging- trading- fighting (PvE + PvP)- Factions (3 Factions + independed + pirates)- Cartels (Guilds)- MissionsUpcoming Main Features- Faction Warfare (players in faction can fight solarsystems to be overtaken for their faction, including station attacks with heavy defenses)- Crafting (not much known yet but expect something more complex then plain crafting)- Cartel Warfare (not much known yet, expect cartels being able to build stations in red solar system, fight and defend them)The potential of EntropyEntropy will for sure never become the next ""EvE Online"" with thousands of players fighting for glory. It's more an EvE Online with direct ship control in a ""family sized environment"". If you like something similar to EvE, with direct ship control and being a name and not a number in fights, Entropy might be yours ;)The upcoming features sound very very good, and i'm sure once faction warfare is in the game (should come soon), people will have things to do for a long time beside farming cash.The direct ship controlYou pilot the ship yourself, and you have a lot methods to move in all directions. Like ""engine kill"" so you can turn while still flying in the old direction. rolling, moving to the side and all kind of things you might needPvP RulesEntropy is designed to be pretty much ""open PvP"". You are only really safe in green solar systems, which are rarely and never connected to each other.Mining and SalvagingBest Mining System i have ever seen so far. Asteroids are quickly mined, and you need to move around a lot and select new asteroids to mine. No more semi-afk mining and salvaging ;)TradingCurrently only moving NPC orders from A to B.Should change later with crafting a lotPlayer PopulationCurrent Population is very low. Developers did not advertise the game yet, so we only have players that found the game by luck somewhere. I'm sure once they start advertising it this will increase a lot.But both servers have some active cartels with majority of players in them so you can always find yourself an active cartel to get hellp and a nice start into the game"

As of right now you get the sense that there is nothing you can really do in this game (largely perhaps due to the lack of population, but also due to a lack of depth).The economics and trade side of things are also boring as you can do little more than move generic products around a 2D map, or mining asteroids (boring).The combat has a lot of potential but against NPCs it is hardly satisfying, I have not seen any large scale PvP fights, in fact I haven't seen more than 2 other players in this game (Global chat is dead). Basic combat could be fun though as already mentioned, I just wonder if it is too ""arcadey"" to offer meaningful strategy.Perhaps my largest gripe with this game is the fact that it isn't a true open universe but heavily instanced as other users have pointed out. I read these reviews before purchasing but as I do play some games that employ this method I thought perhaps it wouldn't bother me as much. However in this game it really does break immersion. Fortunately a recent trailer on IGN had them saying they plan to remove the 2D element of the game and make a real sandbox game.Now I'm not sure where to give my advice/ things I would like to see added etc. So I'll just list them here.-Overall much greater player control-Real open world-Fully player run economy with crafting (should be added soon I think)-More depth to combat-Much greater depth in the Cartel system, like EVE online: with departments, clear structure and complexity. Cartel vs Cartel would be awesome.-Some Avatar combat perhaps - landing on stations and sieging stations etc-Player or Cartel controlled structures (ability to create them), stations and territories (systems); the Cartels could get the tax from these station markets and players could fight for control over them.-Better tutorial and more and better missions to help beginners and to add some structure to the experience.-Player created missions, like bounties or trade missions etc.Basically I want EVE online without all the time wasting and grinding.This game has a lot of potential and I will keenly watch how it evolves, but as of right now I do not recommend this to others unless they want to aid in development.This game COULD become something awesome."

The developers never showed up, and the game play was anemic.  Though I never suspected that ENTROPY to fall into the same calibur as other more advanced space sims, I do look for a certain amount of challenge along with an ease of immersion.Now, I am glad to say that the devs for Entropy has brought ther game to a higher level, removing the 2D environment, making this RPG much more enjoyable.  Though the game still has a long way to go, the changes made recently, brings my personal review up to be adjusted.So many space sims have been coming out, and most of them are demanding high CPUs and high GPUs to run them. Entropy does not.  If ytou ae looking for a good game, check out Entropoy."

Humanity had become dependent on AI technology for their existence. When all the AI technology suddenly shuts down, all humanity crumbled and worlds lost contact with each other to falls. Humanity is rediscovering what the AI had set up for them and how to do things for themselves. They are living off salvaged and rediscovered Tech.The 1980's representation of you ship in comparison to the rest of the universe is to add to the feeling of rediscovering old technology.

You could be a miner and crafter, or a merchant or, of course, a ruthless pirate - even just a bounty hunter - the options are pretty open. The map itself is gigantic which makes for some long travel times, but nothing that is too nasty.Great graphics. The gameplay is good, but could be better - probably be prime with a Steam controller. Sound is fantastic, but the soundtrack needs a little work. Overall, totally worth the price - especially if you consider it's ""early access"" - there is a considerable amount of content to keep you busy while they finish it."

With biweekly updates and the addition of new upcoming content i can't wait to see what it becomes. It needs serious balancing and new features, such as UI and ease-of-access.Basic sim gameplay is like freelancer, economy/trading/mining is EvE. The 2D map is a let-down and a time sink but it grows on you and has lots of potential for tactical gameplay and strategy. For the time being the 2D map is a bare bones nothing.Main reason to get this is that it being a sandbox it will become greater as a whole with more people playing it while it receives content and updates at the same time.  Even in its current state if it was populated it would be a much better experience than it is now.The review will change as the game develops but for now I recommend you give it a try and back its development due to its raw potential"

For an early access game i would say it's pretty stable and it offers enough to do to keep a person busy although it does have a few minor bugs such as some quests not working as intended . I'm still happy with my purchase and i'm looking forward to seeing this game grow into something really good.

It's just not fun.It had a troubled history, developers coming and going, development halted for a period of time, then the game was pushed out in incredibly unfinished state just."
