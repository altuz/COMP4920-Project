After playing Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior you’ll learn that maybe you should reconsider before you go out of your way to break everything in a room.Story:Lo Wang got in a devastating battle at a temple nearby destroying everything in sight. You are hired as a janitor to clean up a terrible mess. Bodies are everywhere, art is destroyed, and you’re the only man for the job.Campaign:There is one level; it’s the same as the first level in the new Shadow Warrior game. It’s your job to clean it up with a mop and your hands. You must deposit the debris into various incinerators, mop up blood, and grab all the cash you can find. The campaign only has two achievements, clean up everything and grab all the money. If you can do this you’ve proven that “you’re the best around and nothing’s ever gonna to keep you down.”Gameplay:This game plays similar to an FPS. The camera is always in first person and your two weapons are a mop and your hands. You must pick up garbage with your hands and throw it into incinerators while mopping up gallons of blood. You better keep your mop clean, but beware for some odd reason the machines that provide water can shoot out an organ. Similar to a normal janitor after you are done you must clock out.Results:If you have always wondered what happens after a game, wonder what life as a janitor for crime scenes would be like, or even just want to play a game that doesn’t push your wits then Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is for you. This brilliant game is hilarious to play if you just beat the first level of Shadow Warrior. For some odd reason the character sounds exactly like Lo Wang, which makes me wonder if after he saved the universe he decided to give up fighting and clean up his messes.Pros:+You get to experience Shadow Warrior through a whole new light.+You get to clean up bodies, mop up blood, and steal money… how many games offer that?+Good graphics+Easy gameplay, with simple controls.+Funny dialogue+Two straightforward achievements+Its free if you already own Shadow Warrior (2013)+YOU GET TO BE A JANITORCons:-Cleaning up everything achievement can be really annoying as a single bullet shell could be the culprit.-There is only one level (why can’t we clean more)"

Ther're not letting me leave. Not until I clean every bit of this temple. I have to finish what I started.DAY 32: -- Wow, its been a long time, I'm getting very hungry, my supply is starting to run out. But i found a bullet shell in the corner on the room.

,Recommended,255520,8253863,"Posted: 24 December, 2013",all,Daniel Potter,"I really like Viscera Cleanup Detail. There is something about that makes it so addictive to play. I personally recommend Santa's Rampage to anyone. Actually, why don't you read my review on it first to get a better understanding of what the game is about.https://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/recommended/265210Now onto Shadow Warrior.The game itself is just a free demo, that you can get by buying Shadow Warrior. That said it doesn't quite do it for me, compared to other games of the series.There is only one level, which is the first level of the Shadow Warrior remake, and it only consists of 2 areas to clean. Mainly, only the floor is messed up in this one, so it really doesn’t offer much. There are no explosives to play around with. In Santa’s rampage you could find letters directed to Santa which can possibly explain his outrage. Again, little things in Santa's Rampage made the game for me - it was as if you were trying to revive Christmas.Again, this demo is missing most of that and for the most part feels hollow. The only real feature is that they copied the character of Wang from the game, but alas, the amount of lines he says is really limited.Unlike ""Santa's Rampage"" version, this game is missing that sense of completion feeling. If you were to put the clean and bloody versions of that level side by side, you will see that they barely differ from each other, compared to Santa’s Rampage. I suppose it is something to do with the lighting.In the end, the game feels very hollow. That said, the game comes free for all Shadow Warrior owners. I suppose the game can be considered as a little bonus. But you know, i still recommend you to try out Santa's Rampage."

You get to see the building where some part of the prologue of SW took place. Two main halls littered with spliced up bodies and, of course blood, is everywhere. Not only bodies but bullet casings, pieces of glass and other trash await to be picked up.There is an incinerator where you need to take everything. Buckets are available full of water so that you can clean your mop and you can get cases where you can collect all the stuff so that you can dispose of them at the incinerator at once.There is a radio in the 1st hall where the music of SW is being played and the janitor guy tries to act like Lo Wang by saying one-liners regularly. Also, you can collect money rolls and there is a special case where you can collect all these.This is a no brainer but a good pastime.

OOOHH YOU WANNA CLEANUP SOME WANG?This game does something I thought nothing could ever do... It made cleaning your mess up fun.So as an employee of Zilla Corp. You are assigned to clean up the temple that was trashed in the beginning of Shadow Warrior, all the bodies, blood, and damn broken glass.You use your mop to clean up blood, the incinerator to burn the little bits, and the hazmat bins for the bigger stuff. Find some bloody money? Put it in the suitcase for an extra reward when you clock out... and maybe put a few priceless artifacts in there too. And why not use that dinky little device you received to make sure you didn’t miss anything? And remember, clean with honor.Wow, was it difficult to decide if I recommend this or not. It’s a cleaning game, so there’s defiantly going to be mixed opinions, for example a friend and I LOVE these Cleanup Detail games, while two of my other friends hate them, and I recommend on if I like a game or not, not if it's good or bad. So there were two ways I could review this, as a good game or as a bad game. I decided I’ll do it as a good game, because I sure as hell liked it.This, for being a cleaning game, is amazing. Somehow it makes cleaning addicting, I spent an hour just burning stuff and another cleaning up the blood... and I was okay with that!The visuals, as with Shadow Warrior’s, aren’t too great, but defiantly get the job done. Dialog is amazing with Wang’s witty comments as you burn stuff and find money.But this game is riddled with bugs and glitches. Sometimes when picking up an object, it sporadically flies through the air, or when you move the suitcase all the money gets throw across the room, and the worst, disappearing objects. After three hours of cleaning and burning, I had found all the money and was getting ready to clock out, but I bumped the suitcase, causing it to glitch out and send one of the rolls of bills flying. Luckily, I watched where it landed. Unluckily, I also watched it fall out of the map through the floor.OCD people will love/hate this game, and so will anybody with addictive natures. But I doubt any 'hardcore' Call of Duty players will enjoy this for more than ten minutes.Pros:Lo Wang's witty commentsrevolutionizes cleaningaddictive gameplayinteresting and original mechanics (using incinerator, buckets spilling, Etc.)Cons:it’s a cleaning game...

You basically are a janitor tasked to clean up blood, body parts & weapons throughout 2 halls and some corridors in a temple. Just take your mop, your blood/garbage sniffer and your hands to get rid of all the filth you find. It took me 3 hours and was a strangely satisfying experience. It is nothing special and rather short but kinda fun. My own room in real life is still a mess but at least one digital temple is clean and I received 2 achievements.

I liked how the main character made several quips as I cleaned up the temple, though a lot of them became grunts after a while. I didn't stop playing till I had the entire level spotless, but that didn't seem to unlock the achivement listed for this game, nor did colecting all the money seem to do anything for the achivements either.  I don't know what to say about that, other than maybe it was a bug? The game may seem a little short in hind sight, but it took hours to finish it. I'd give it 5/5 stars, but i am a little annoyed that the achivements didn't work, so only four. Also, i can't help but wonder what's beyond the doors at the top of the second main area.  I probably would know if i got the ""shadow warriors"" game. but i don't real have the money for that right now.UPDATE: so I just realized i was playing the game on host, as i was orginaly going to play it with a friend of mine. I'm not sure, but it might be that the achivements didn't activate because i wasn't in single player.It's also possible that they didn't activate because i don't own a copy of shadow warrior"

Then this might be the janitorial simulator for you.What can I say about this title? For a start it’s free. So yep I have no doubts that it’s a real bargain. Not only is as cheap as it’s possible to be without paying you to play it, it’s also a heck of fun as well. I spent over an hour cleaning up the carnage left by some previous assassin who thought it would be fun to paint the walls, floor and ceiling red. It is a lot better than it sounds.Listening to all the janitors little comments made me chuckle every time. The environment is pretty, but then again it is supposed to be an oriental shrine…. Or temple…. Or castle…. I think it’s just a rich guy’s palace actually.If you do get hold of Shadow Warrior and end up with this free dlc you should really play this to completion, those last few blood stains hidden on the carpet may drive you mad but the feeling of accomplishment for finishing is worth it.

They should probably look into using it as possible treatment for OCD and maybe even ADD patients. But I digress, I never thought in a million, billion, trillion years that I would play several hours of what is essentially just a cleaning simulator, but here we are in the year 2015 where people like 'PewDewPie' are popular, so I guess anything goes now. Like taking a level from 'Shadow Warrior' and having the poor janitor clean up the aftermath. Spoiler alert: it all works out for him in the end. If you manage to complete the game, that is. It's a test of will.Initially this game can be pretty frustrating to play. The learning curve is short, but the first ten or twenty minutes will most likely be very aggravating, at least for me they were. And this is mostly due to the fact that it's super easy to track blood literally anywhere. Oh! Don't step into those tracks of blood or you'll create new fresh tracks. Oh! Don' t smack that severed head into anything or you'll leave a brand new blood splatter all over it. Oh! Don't knock over those incredibly not sturdy disposal units or you'll reek havoc on the squeaky clean floor. Seriously, why are they so easy to spill over, even when they're full?!"
,Recommended,255520,15230976,"Posted: 5 April, 2015",all,Y|yukichigai,"A fun little bonus for any OCD fans of the new Shadow Warrior game.  Sure, Lo Wang can cut a swath through an army of men, but can he clean up after himself?Like many who have played any of the Viscera Cleanup Detail games, I have to say that this game is surprisingly fun for essentially being a housecleaning simulator.  Yeah, on the one hand it's not an adrenaline rush where you feel like a badass for fighting of armies of dudes left and right.  On the other hand though, it's relaxing and pleasant.  Here is a goal, here are your tools, complete as you will.  No time limit, no rush, no one else mucking it up.This particular iteration gets a little bit of a comedic boost by putting you in the shoes of Lo Wang himself, who is none too shy about voicing his opinions on the entire process.  While none of the lines were laugh out loud material, the commentary still brought a smile to my face, making an already enjoyable experience that much better.There are some flaws with this particular version of Viscera Cleanup Detail though.  For one, there are exactly zero instructions available through the game itself.  No way to see controls, no explanation of the objects in the game, no explanation of how to gather money, dispose of remains, or even how to clean your mop.  Most of the game's mechanics I figured out just by poking around, but quite a few I didn't understand until late in my playthrough, things like disposing of items in the Incinerator or how I could get fresh buckets of water from a machine that literally makes buckets of water.  It made me feel a bit cheated in some ways, and certainly undermined a bit of my enjoyment of the game.There is an argument that could be made for game mechanics not being directly explained, since they are relatively simple and not too difficult to figure out.  However, I can really think of no excuse for why there's no way to display the game's controls, much less any way to rebind them.  I will admit that this is not a title where keybindings can make the difference between success and failure, but at the same time the Unreal engine is hardly a difficult engine to add a keybind menu to.  At the very least having an option to display the keybindings would be trivial, and the fact that there's no option to show them is almost unforgivable.  Really, what were the devs thinking?Now, that said, the instructional issues are not a dealbreaker, not for a relatively low-key game such as this.  I still had a surprisingly good time guiding Lo Wang as he cleaned up his own trail of blood, gore, and dismemberment.  As long as you're comfortable with the bog-standard WASD control setup and are willing to look up instructions elsewhere, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is a fun little diversion worth spending a few hours on."

With the mop you will clean the floor/walls/roof from blood. After some blurs the mop will be full of blood and needs to be cleaned, otherwise you will mess up your cleaned placed. There is a station where you can get a new bucket full of fresh water to clean the mop. After some cleanings the water of the bucket will be deep red and needs to be changed too. You have to burn it in a furnace like all other things you will find: cartridge cases, weapons, money and lot of body parts. Your boots will suck full of blood and leave bloody footsteps if you're walking through pools of blood. To finish your cleaning you have to go to a console to check out. The system will inform you about your current progress, if you want to leave and the system is telling you to 'leave the place in shame' then you know you're not done.Pros:+ 'unique' idea for a game+ concept works+ funny comments to certain body partsexample: picking up a heart and he is saying: 'died because of a broken heart' ^^+ funny placed bodiesexample: a person hanging at a wall pierced with a blade will tear apart by picking it up+ no fall damage+ multiplayer(!)Cons:- radio can't be turned on to have music (means no music at all -.-)- less variety in cleaning- only one static level- too few achievements (compared toVCD: Santa's Rampage)- main game will have no effect to the level structureSuggestions:~ add music and cleaning will be more fun~ more achievements (for example 'Lower Ear': Finding the ear of the Boss, 'Gun Connector': Collect all gun types, ..)~ connect the main game with the cleaner (save the slaughter in a DB and load it with the cleaner to have an awesome vice versa gameplay of your own barbarities)Recommended, but only if it'son sale, because it has a short play time and less variety in cleaning.6/10"

I enjoyed some of the voice acting but it got tiresome fast, it is humorous but needs a lot more or you will get sick of hearing the same lines over and over.The main reason I don't recommend this game is because I didn't get what I bought this game for, completing the two achievements.I clocked out with a trunk full of $2,000,000 (in 22 pieces) and a temple fully cleaned and was commended on the clock out screen for my efforts yet I didn't unlock either of the achievements.Secondly on the main menu they've got a host/join option presumably for multiplayer/coop janitorial duties that does not work at all. I've followed many guides and read developers comments on this and they say it works but it doesn't. I've tried the hosting a dedicated server method, I've opened all of the necessary ports but my friends are unable to join my server, nor am I able to join a friends server.If it was just the latter problem I would still recommend this game as it doesn't say multiplayer/coop on the store page, but it certainly advertises achievements which I still don't have."

This game is good for a quick laugh if you can tolerate the game's gore-saturated humor, and the two achievements the game offers are very challenging.

This usually made me just bring the objects one by one to the incinerator instead of putting them into the bucket.So yeah: wouldn't really buy it for over a dollar but it's fine in a bundle. I had some fun for free and we owe a huge 'thank you' for the developers to provide this game for us. If you have one or two free hours and you want to have two extra achievements, play this, it's a nice little game. Otherwise just stick with Shadow Warrior and do the cleaning in real life between levels. :)"

You will walk around in the palace and clean up all the blood and body parts. After some time your mop will be covered in blood and you will need to wash it off by going to a water source. Body parts can leave new blood marks which you will need to clean up again. Putting a body part into a bucket of water will turn the water into blood and can no longer be used to clean up your equipment.Meh gameplay.Low replayability.Not recommended to play.Okay controls.Multiplayer servers are dead and playing the game alone is boring.Is too overpriced if you are not a shadow warrior fan.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10

I'm familiar with the full Viscera Cleanup Detail and the Santa's Workshop stand-alone, but had yet to play either of those, so I was going into this experience with fresh eyes.  Boy, what an experience it turned out to be.  I had seen the trailers, the screenshots, but actually walking into Zilla's dojo to pick up the mess left by Lo Wang was somehow, as boring as the idea of janitorial labor may sound, so cathartic and entertaining.I'm not sure if the assets were reused ad-naseum from Shadow Warrior, but this stand alone still looks as gorgeous as the base game.  The new parts added in specifically for VCD have just a vaguely more cartoonish style to them than the rest of the game, but it isn't jarring, and just makes things easier to play as you can easily, visually, distinguish what is part of the map, and what is a tool to help you clean it.In my playthrough, I spent HOURS scrubbing the hell out of the floor, the walls, and burning any body part, organ, or piece of shrapnel that didn't belong.  The tasks were reptitive, but not in annoying way, it felt a lot more like playing something that keeps you coming back despite staying the same mechanically, like Tetris, than it did actually doing a chore like mowing the lawn or shoveling the sidewalk.Despite all of this, the punchout machine still gave me flak for not completing the job properly, for someone with severe OCD this could probably be maddening, as I walked around the map for a good ten minutes looking for anything I had forgotten to clean up.  I guess even in the virtual space, perfection isn't easily obtained.This nice little freebie (yes,it comes free with the base Shadow Warrior purchase) has me sold on the main Viscera Cleanup Detail game, and I'm looking forward to seeing how RuneStorm expands upon the concept for a full-blown title of their own design."

This isn't for you.If you like screwing around in a serious game trying to do stuff you really shouldn't do in the real game... this will probably entertain you for some time.If you're OCD, project-oriented, or process-optimization-oriented, then this can turn into crack-cocaine for you.Like all VCD's, you'll either love it or hate it. It sparks a certain user-base while really annoying another. Really not much middle ground.Last time I played Shadow Warrior was in the 90's when it came out after Duke Nukem 3D. I haven't played the updated version. I'm just getting old and bored with ""serious"" games. But, VCD has caught my interest, and the Shadow Warrior VCD was pretty entertaining.I think my only beef with it is there's no ""Office"" after-party to show how you did like in the main VCD game. You go to clock out, and it berates you saying there's still cleaning to do. You look all over the place, but it looks clean. You use the sniffer... don't get anything. So, you ""clock out in shame"" just to get back to the start screen. No telling how well you did.I don't mind a stand-alone game, but I think this should have been tacked onto VCD as a level instead of as a stand-alone game. Modify ""The Office"" to include trophy showcases for Shadow Warrior stuff. (But, that's an issue with VCD as a whole... The Office is a pretty lackluster trophy showroom.)Overall, had fun. Worth it if you love VCD. Lo Wang's comments were funny at times. However, they really didn't do much to flex the potential of VCD. It was just cleaning as usual. There were no puzzles or secret areas or such to find. Just typical VCD things."

76561197973129601,Not Recommended,255520,31281799,Posted: 21 April,all,StefanWB,"The basic question one has to ask as a consumer when reviewing a product is simple: ""is this game worth my money?"". Well, when a game is free (well, free with Shadow Warrior anyway, which I think is a fun game, 7/10), that question becomes: ""is this game worth my time?"". As far as I'm concerned, my answer to that question is no.Some people - quite a few, actually - claim to really love VCD, and I can sorta see why. It's a fantastic concept, a hilarious rib at violent shooters, and one of those questions that you may ask yourself while playing a game (""gee, I wonder which poor sod is going to have to clean up this mess...""). But as can be the case, a terrific concept doesn't always lead to a fun game, and VCD is tedium defined.The biggest flaw with the game is that I find myself constantly frustrated by the clunky controls and wonky physics. The game supposedly lets you put body parts and other detritus into boxes that you can then move over to the furnace to save yourself time, but that's hardly worth it when trying to put body parts into the boxes is exceeded in awkwardness and frustration only by trying to move them from the box to the furnace.I played this game solo, so maybe I had a demonstrably less rich experience than someone playing co-op would have, but I'm of the opinion that if a game has a singleplayer option, it should be enjoyable when played as such. And no amount of one-liners, songs on the radio, or anything else can change the fact that thinking about playing this game for long enough to actually finish the job (which the game claims can take up to 3 hours) makes me want to scream.I think Shadow Warrior is a pretty good game that I'd recommend you pick up when it's on sale if you like stylish, non-realistic FPS games, and since you get this for free there's no reason not to at least load it up and see if it does anything for you. Maybe you're the kind of cleaning freak, OCD person that would enjoy this, and I am absolutely not judging you if that is the case. But maybe you're not one of those people, and you may well end up feeling the same things I felt when I played this: feelings of loathing, pain, and that odd sense you get when you understand a joke and think you should find it funny, but don't laugh."

The game has real life applicability, since the tasks are so simple and boring it pretty much prepares you for your upcoming cleaning career.+ Free game (included when purchasing Shadow Warrior).+ Game lasts 1-2 hours, so thankfully the pain of playing is short-lived.Negatives:- Horrificly monotonous. This entire game consists of using your mop and bucket to clean blood from the temple floors and then you're expected to dispose of guns, shell casings, katanas, shurikens and severed body parts by placing them in the biohazard bins.- Experience the sheer frustration and tedium of a cleaner, as you'll regularly mop up your own bloody footprints and walk back and forth to refill mop buckets with water, or get new biohazard bins.Overall Score 1/10For anyone aspiring to be a janitor, I really do recommend this incredibly repetitive, dull game. As for the rest of us, avoid. I got it for free with Shadow Warrior, so it didn't cost me a cent. But that still doesn't mean it's good, in fact it's downright bad."

But consequently it's a massive pain to even begin play. Generally the former point wouldn't be a problem, but with this being such a unique type of game, failure to explain its mechanics seems foolish and almost arrogant on the part of the developer.I applaud the attempt to try something new in terms of gameplay, but in this state the game is almost immediately frustrating and for that fact alone I can't in good faith recommend it."

Like in real life, if you step in a pool of blood you'll leave footprints that ""someone's"" gonna have to clean up.Only real downside I found was that sometimes the physics in the game went haywire and that box full of stuff you were carrying to the furnace starts acting like it's possessed, throwing your stuff all over the place.Happened a few times but can be avoided once you learn how to move with it.All in all the game was more fun that I thought it would be since I ended up spending an hour with it.

This game is really more of a joke than an actual game but it works, it has no bugs and for a few minutes it was pretty fun......before it became boring and repetitive. Still, I successfully incinerated most of the gibs, left bloody footprints all over the floor in the process but left the job site unfinished (the Zillah corporation can go screw itself) with 1,450,000 dollars I found laying around along with 2 katanas, a submachine gun, a pistol and a human head, all locked neatly in my character's trunk.In this game, you play a janitor tasked with cleaning up the initial scene of the game Shadow Warrior's prologue all from a first-person-perspective. You have a digital device which helps you find messes, a mop and your two gloved hands. With these tools you are to go about cleaning up the numerous pools of blood and scattered body parts from around by mopping the floor with clean water and shoving everything else (including the body parts) into either of the 2 nearby incinerators. Picking stuff up and putting it in the incinerators is the fun part. Every time you pick anything up (including body parts) your character groans, moans or complains or says some dry witticism. Mopping however is intensely boring. It's basically a fairly accurate simulation of mopping a really messy floor (which I why I didn't bother to do it much).You can clock out of the job site early, leaving the job unfinished or, for a single measly Steam Achievement, you can finish the enormous cleaning job. The graphics are good and the sound is adequate. The music comes from a scratchy tinny radio set which you can carry around from place to place to listen to as you work. It plays music from the Shadow Warrior remake. This game is clearly just intended for a few laughs. I mean you could actually take the trouble to complete it, but...if you wanted to do that why not just mop an actual floor for a far more visceral experience and be more useful at the same time? Still, this game might be fun to play simply so you can tell your friends that you actually played it (kind of like playing surgeon simulator)."

Lo Wang's hilarious comments make it even better than the other viscera games. No bugs at all, which is fantastic, since bugs and glitches can hinder your progress in other viscera titles. The only thing that made it kind of annoying is that after you clean up all the blood, body parts etc. you need to search the room from top to bottom to find that last bloodstain that your radar detects but you can't see. This can take at least a half hour, even more if the stain is on the roof or somewhere difficult to reach. Don't expect replay value. I have only played it start to finish 2 times.

This is a supplemental game to go with Shadow Warrior that comes from the creators of the interestingly unfinished original game Viscera Cleanup Detail - learn about that game and you know what to expect here. You're a janitor tasked with cleaning up a location early from the Shadow Warrior game.The Physics can be a pain to deal with, making it hard to get items into buckets or furnaces, gibs flying around during clean up to make your job harder, and the worst are objects or blood spatters that end up in such awkward locations that you need to resort to cheating to find them. The devs should find a way to mitigate this necessity.That said this stupid but enjoyable experience can be finished in about an hour or two and while the game has an intentionally annoying factor to it, it feels strangely satisfying to do something so mundane in a video game world. I definitely recommend playing this or Santa's Rampage for some laughs."

Somehow it is completely satisfying to get every last ounce of blood, every random chooped off head, and every discarded katana into the incinerator.I will say there was one negative, and that is on my first play-through, a sword got stuck in the incinerator (like between the pixels in the side of it) and no matter how much jabbing with my mop, it wouldn't dislodge.

I just had to clean up everything. It's oddly entertaining for a game that is basically about janitorial duties. There are a few problems like the fact that all buckets, waste baskets and the money basket are a chore to carry around and sometimes get stuck in the floor causing either you or the object your carrying to be propelled along. It's kind of annoying yet somewhat charming. You pick up limbs and giblets of the enemy combatants in the game Shadow Warrior and have to incinerate them by either carrying them into the waste baskets or just throwing them in yourself. Carrying the small items in your hands like the body parts works much better than the baskets so I just took them individually unless I there was small items on the floor like bullets which I would collect in the baskets. The second part of you job is to mop up blood and this can be made hard because sometimes the blood can be very faded. Luckily there is a tracker which both tells you when your near blood and near body parts depending on which mouse button you click to turn it on. I personally like the fact that the tracker is not just a GPS that leads you to the exact location next bloodstain but instead a object that beeps faster the closer you are. Some may find it annoying in a world where games always tell us where to go even for the secrets but like Shadow Warrior, Viscera Cleanup Deatail has a feeling of less hand holding even while in an area that is less open than most games. For achievements there is of course the achievement for cleaning up the whole place and the achievement for getting all the hidden money in the game. There are 20 stacks of cash in the game that are usually in piles of body parts that you must put in a cash box iin order to unlock the achievement. While both of these achievements seem missable they are actually very easy to track. Just go to the door that has the device that asks you if you want to leave and push the button to activate and to leave. It will then tell you how much money you have and whether the rooms are all clear. If it says you have less than 2 million dollars and you left the room unclean than you simply push the button that you actually want to stay. Then just go through the rooms again once with the giblets tracker and then again with the blood tracker to find what you have missed. It's actually a very simple yet oddly entertaining game. For a free add-on to a game that I would say is worth it's price point it is an oddly entertaining experience that I oddly wrote a lot about in this review. You don't need to pick up Shadow Warrior to play this game but I highly suggest it since Shadow Warrior itself is a refreshing and gory FPS that actually has a fun sword mechanic."

Also, free.Picking up and incincerating limbs is relatively engaging. However, between the frustration of trying to right a full crate of body parts and having them flung everywhere, and having to pick up bullet casings, I would rather recommend a second playthrough of Shadow Warrior.I would recommend playing, I would not recommend winning.Please note I didn't get either achievement but clocked out with $1.2 mill."

Priceless artifacts, piles of money, and all the blood and gore you can handle. As a kid, I hated cleaning as an adult I'm still not a fan I do just enough to get by. However, when it comes to this game my OCD kicks in and everything has to be perfect I spend hours on levels. Where this branch off is one level with a total of two achievements it still took me the better part of 3 hours to complete. This is kind of a nitch game if you like it you like it I would recommend watching videos are seeing if there's a demo before buying it. Definitely not for everyone but I myself enjoyed it so, if you werid or OCD you might as well."
