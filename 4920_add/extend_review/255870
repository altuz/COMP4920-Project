Keep in mind this is a simplified version of the game, as you progress the game introduces some new mechanics and ships to keep things varied.+ Combing the different liquids together is really cool and adds a fresh new gameplay idea, combining different liquids together provides different results.+Graphics fit the enviroment nicely+ Some cool boss battles+ Achievements are easy to get and shouldn't provide too much trouble.The Bad:- The game doesn't really take its ideas far enough leaving a very easy game.  The game doesn't get that much harder as you progress either. I was a bit disappointed when I beat the game.-Roughly 3 hours long, 5-7 hours if you go for achievements.ConclusionAlthough I had fun, I felt the game was a bit basic for my taste. I would have liked the game to be a bit more challenging especially in regards to the puzzles as the game does introduce some cool elements later on in the game."

The games difficulty is not very high but unless you know what you are doing enemies may surprise you. The game also comes with a Co-Op mode to allow you to play with your friends.Shooter is an addictive and charming little game well worth the small price tag.

,Not Recommended,255870,8901160,"Posted: 29 January, 2014",all,rex,"I was pretty disappointed by this game. I really liked Eden so was excited to try out Shooter.  At first I really enjoyed it. I liked the graphical style, the overall gameplay, and the fluid mechanics and interactions are super cool.  But then tedium set in.  None of the levels are difficult.  I probably died like 20 times in the entire run through, and most of those were to bosses or me just being lazy.  It's also pretty much the same thing over and over with slight variations, and I don't really like the necessary compulsion to collect jewels in order to progress through levels. That requirement seems like it's there solely to make a short game longer. It doesn't add anything to the experience.  The combat is also pretty repetitive.  It never presents a challenge and the enemies pretty much just exist to give you something to do other than collect jewels and scientists and avoid environmental hazards.Also, the music just doesn't make any sense. It feels like it was made for another game and accidentally inserted into Shooter. It's out of context.And then there's the fact that this game came out for PS3 in 2009 and is selling for $9 (the Steam release date is Nov 11, 2013). There's even a sequel that came out in 2011. I didn't realize that and I guess that's my fault, but come on.The game isn't terrible, but it's not particularly good either.  You might enjoy it if you want a casual, easy, pick up and play type of game and like the graphical style. As I said, the fluid physics and interactions were really inventive and used well.  I would have like PJ to have harnessed that a bit better to make this a deeper game. All in all I can't recommend it generally."

,Recommended,255870,8011387,"Posted: 11 December, 2013",all,arbor day,"This is my favorite PixelJunk title.The game controls similar to most twin-stick shooters (Smash TV, Geometry Wars, Beat Hazard) with the left stick moving your ship, and the right stick changing which direction you are facing. Shooting is done via the right trigger, and the left trigger lets you grapple people or gems into your ship.There is a central mechanic of liquid physics at work, with early levels having water and lava. You often have to lead the water where you need it to go, while trying not to lead the lava places you want to keep safe. The water can be directed to lava to allow you to clear it out, and some maps have earthquakes that happen at certain times, releasing one or the other fluids from off screen. This can either be helpful, or very harmful. Triggered lava can cut off secrets if you take too long, or lead to death.Rather than a life bar, you have a heat gauge that fills up when you take damage, get too close to lava, or fire missiles instead of your little pea shooter. Getting away from the action will allow you to slowly cool down, or you can fly into water to speed up the process greatly. If you over heat, which trying to fly through lava will certainly do, your ship will stall and you will die.The music and animations are also well done. Moving or turning your ship makes it's tiny fins and boosters move and fire, rather than just rotating some plain sprite. A lot of neat little touches went into this game that other developers would have just not bothered with.It's a really fun title, and well worth the price."

Buy PixelJunk Shooter Ultimate instead, it contains this game with a graphical overhaul plus its sequel for one dollar more.)PixelJunk Shooter is a twin-stick shooter/puzzle game with some neat liquid physics. I found it very reminiscent of indie puzzle platformers, only based on a twin-stick shooter engine instead of, well, a platformer engine, with some tricky levels and fun boss fights at the end of each of the three chapters.The only real drawbacks are that it's a bit on the short side and, when it comes to finding all of the treasures and secret areas, the game often turns into Pixel♥♥♥♥♥ Shooter, with you needing to flail your grapple around in corners, destroy all the soft rock in large levels, and try pushing your ship into all of the dead ends in order to get 100% completion. That's... not quite as entertaining as actually playing the game for progression.Still, it ends up a solid enough game to earn my recommendation."

,Recommended,255870,8635783,"Posted: 9 January, 2014",all,ani.for.prez,"A great little addition to the twin-stick shooter clan, this game is very much deserving of your monies.The gameplay is solid with excellent physics which are thankfully not entirely tied to your movement which makes the controls quite responsive. There's a variety of enemies with different types of attacks though most of the actual threat comes from the environments themselves. You have to dodge the lava, the black goo and the exploding gases and carefully but quickly wind your way through the mazes, rescuing crew members. The different suits you can put on in certain levels certainly shakes up the gameplay quite a bit. The secret treasures are also fun to look out for. The crowning glory are the 3 bosses. Each require very different strategies and defeating them is indeed a challenge. You have to look out for the weak spots which usually glow but as with the rest of the game, the real challenge lies not in hitting the spots, but dodging the environment and the other enemies.The graphics are good with a very colorful style. The colors were chosen with great care though since you very rarely confuse the foreground with the background. the colours also help in identifying the types of surfaces which greatly aids in knowing exactly where you want to go.Special mention goes to the soundtrack which is a mix of many different and weird styles with lots of random sounds and speech bytes for added measure. Makes for a nice atmosphere.The one con would be that the story ends very abruptly and is primed for a sequel.If you;re a fan of twin stick shooters, make sure not to miss this!"

76561198028694879,Recommended,255870,16583314,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,thebiad,"Well, I just finished PixelJunk Shooter after ~11 hours of gameplay, and I can say that every minute of it was enjoyable.  It's part shooter, part puzzle game, with elements of gameplay that remind me of Ikaruga (without the ridiculous level of difficulty), a 2d sandbox game (for use of elements, not a customizable world), and the Zelda series.Each level is well-designed, visually entertaining, and the addition of new gameplay mechanics comes at just the right pace to keep you from getting bored.  The basic gameplay is 1) fly around, rescuing scientists with your grappling hook, shoot a few (easy) enemies before they kill you, blow away rock to find secret rooms/gems and use new ship ""suits"" and their powers to manipulate the elements to solve puzzles.  The boss design is cute, and challenging enough that you probably won't beat them on the first try or the second, but you won't become frustrated, either.  You life meter is very different from most shooters; instead of a couple hits killing you outright, damage (environmental and enemy) causes you to overheat, and you either need to cool off by plunging into water, or take a time out before you blow yourself up.  This was a very refreshing take on damage for a shooter, and allows one to make a couple foolish mistakes and impatient attempts without being penalized too heavily.My favorite part of the game was the interplay of the elements in the game:  lava, water, ice, explosive gas, dirt, and a corrosive + magnetic fluid.  When lava hits water, it turns into dirt (and gets cosumed in the process), which you can use to dam up areas, or create an umbrella over yourself for safe passage, and it can also melt ice, or ignite the explosive gas!  Passing through the gass slightly overheats your ship, and is dangerous, because something else in the environment may ignite it while you're in the cloud, killing you.  Water turns to ice when it hits other ice, which may trap and kill your ship, or be ripped down with the grappling hook to clear it away, or deliver water to other areas.  Water also turns the black magnetic fluid into explosive gas.  The magnetic fluid is drawn to your ship, so don't fly to closely over it, as it will rise up to meet you, and quickly causes damage!  It can also be attracted to other magnets, which are usually controlled by a remote switch, playing very similarly to the water dungeons in Zelda.To further interact with these elements, there are several suits your ship can wear, which are accessible via landing strips in the appropriate levels.  There's a water suit, which swaps your ship's missle launcher for a water hose (don't forget to shoot above yourself and let it rain down on you if you're overheating!), and uniquely, has a grappling hook which can grab and rip off chunks of ice, since you no longer have a weapon that can blast anything away.  The magma suit operates similarly, exchanging your missles for a lava hose, but don't assume you're fireproof!  The inverter suit doesn't change your weapons at all, but switches the gameplay mechanics so that water ""overheats"" you, and lava ""cools"" and heals you, allowing passageway through areas you couldn't previously reach, as well as added dangers.  The magnetic repeller suit keeps your missles, but instead of attacting the magnetic/corrosive fluid, you repel it, which can be used to safely traverse pools of it, as well as deflect it away into enemies, or to fill containers that act as switches.All in all, I'm VERY satisfied with this game, especially for the $1 or whatever it cost in the bundle deal (PixelJunk's tower defense game is HORRIBLE, don't even install it!).  It's simple enough for early teenagers to play, and fun/creative enough for adults as well.  It's a game I'm proud to have in my library to support the developers, and was entertaining all the way through.  I'd say this game is worth $4.99 on its own, and anything less than that is a steal."

I take my hat off to the level designers who managed to keep expanding on a simple idea into a fun and fulfilling game. The idea of the power suits and how they change the dynamics of gameplay was outstanding. Fingers crossed the PC gets the sequel.

Was disappointed when trying to play the game with a friend: Somehow it doesn't support game controllers. And who these days, plays on two keyboards?"

But progresses quickly in complexity and depth.  I lost interest in this game quickly because its more puzzle than shooter. But I can see why so many like this game and I definately would recommend getting it if it is on sale.  This type of game would be a great way to get a new Steam/ PC gamer hooked."

If you're a fan of old school space shooters, PixelJunk Shooter is a great addition to the genre. The contemporary styling and controls are very enjoyable. An easy buy especially if on sale."
