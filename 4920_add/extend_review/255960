Some of you in the scene may even remember dancing to ""Bad Mojo"" on the dance floor throughout the gothic and industrial scene.The soundtrack is a double disc set and comes in FLAC as well as MP3 formats along with ALL ARTWORK for the disc, tray cards, etc. - It's hidden away in your game directory at <drive>:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/BadMojo/Bonus Content/Soundtrack (FLAC) and Soundtrack(MP3)I hope you enjoy this little bonus and while I don't see anything from any sales of this game, the hopes is you check out my site and maybe check out my other music and soundtrack work.Comments welcomed!Bat / Xorcist"

The extent of your abilities as the roach are to move up, down, left, and right, and interact with things by pushing them or using your weight or presence.  The short term goals the roach needs to achieve (puzzles) are cryptically given in the form of poetic (rhyming) riddles that are often subtlely humorous; the puzzles themselves are quite challenging, possibly to the point of being frustrating for some players depending on their tolerence for or enjoyment of adventure game puzzles.The developers and creaters of the game did a very good job in realizing a very dark and ominous game in tone, atmosphere, and mood.  The music is also very good and fits perfectly.  The Steam release also includes some extra content:  the soundtrack (two compact discs worth) in mp3 and FLAC format, some videos with developer commentary, concept art, storyboards and more."

Worth a watchthrough for the over the top fmv sequences and the kafkaesque tale of a insect trying to get back to primary primate status once more.Yeah just check out a playthrough on youtube. It's more fun than actually trying to play the game and looks better encoded to video as well."
76561198005215613,Recommended,255960,11543141,"Posted: 3 August, 2014",all,[TK],"This game is as great as it seems, with flaws as evident as it seems.You'll have a great experience, exploring a world through the eyes of a cockroach. The scenary is detailed and very realistic on the objects and interactions you'll find, even though graphics are clearly limited. It's old technology, but it is so well done it feels right. The history is a good and interesting complement to the theme.On the negative side, controls and game feedback are bad. Sometimes you know you have to interact with something, but can't seem to get it done, and sometimes you'll find yourself with no clues to resolve a puzzle.I recommend playing this game with a walkthrough, for times you get stuck. To me, it did not ruin an excelent game experience, and made me focus on the many good points in this game.It's a short game (I would guess most people would take around 3-5 hours to finish it) and even though is limited on playability, it makes you feel like you're really living a history. In the experience aspect, it is a far better game than many modern ones."

Bad Mojo is a nasty, gritty adventure game about a man turned cockroach. It's a major displeasure to look at, and fittingly so. The game's pretty cryptic at first, being thrown into a sewer with no instructions, but if you continue exploring around, where you're supposed to be going will be guided pretty much. $5.99 isn't bad, as you get bonus material such as concept art. and the making-of documentaries along with commentary over the cutscenes, so, overall, if you're not squeemish, get Bad Mojo."
,Recommended,255960,12596256,"Posted: 21 October, 2014",all,Murikov,"A weird, partly nauseating, yet strangely good adventure game from the golden 90s. A small blast from the past.After being transformed into a cockroach, it's up to the player to find out more about his mysterious past and to solve puzzles in a ridden-down tavern in San Francisco. From the bird's eye perspective you control the cockroach with your arrow keys i.e. with WASD and basically let it crawl around in bathrooms, kitchens and other rooms to find out how to transform yourself back into your human form. During your bizarre journey other insects and animals are happy to help you or to eat you - watch out for Franz, the cat.The story is mainly being told by several live-action cutscenes, pouring the charm and the feeling of 90's FMV games. While some younger gamers nowadays may disagree with me, I find that such cutscenes with real actors should find their way to modern gaming again. It gives a story a much more deeper note, even though acting back then wasn't always top-notch. Remember the good old C&C cutscenes by the way?Anyway, the game is quite short though (circa 4 hours) and has its flaws as well. Sometimes there are some bugs (hehe, bugs...) when the savestate is being loaded and your roach suddenly finds itself trapped in a wet spot. Just load again the same game if this happens. Furthermore the pre-rendered 2D graphics with the relatively small interactive sections aren't everybody's taste, but I found them appealing for a mid-90's adventure game.The Good:+ A fair amount of live-action cutscenes+ Good and innovative story+ Interesting interaction with small-scale environment+ A dark, grimly atmosphereThe Bad:- Relatively short- Outdated (but charming) graphics- Some minor bugs (not the ants, maggots, roaches...)The Ugly:-- Some nasty scenes in the game. I liked them though.Give Bad Mojo a try if it's on sale, it keeps you entertained for a whole evening. With its numerous cutscenes it sometimes appears like a interactive movie rather than a video game. Nonetheless pretty recommended.7/10"

Even if you are not a big fan of adventure games, I strongly recommend it. It's hardcore and very atmospheric. Feels like if Kafka made this game(not only because of the transformation part). And one more thank you to the developers for including such bibs and bobs as ""making of"" video and especially the soundtrack. I had first played it when I was around 13 and this was one of THE games that defined my future tastes in gaming and even movies."

But assuming you have a walkthrough in hand for when you get stuck, it's a really unique experience. A surreal feverdream of a game with a gritty horror atmosphere coupled with cheesy but charming FMVs. I would definitly recommend it if you are into adventure games. Especially if you like your games old, weird and obscure.Be wary though, some people are apparently unable to run the game. But for me it worked just fine."

,Recommended,255960,16546150,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,Hem,"In short: It is a simple, almost casual puzzle/story based video game from the 90s, with real grandiloquent acting captioned, extremely easy gameplay (four arrow keys), and loosely inspired by Kafka, that is a gloomy, raw and modern take on human psychology... and cockroaches.In very short: This game is a masterpiece. Buy it. Now.Alright so to make it a bit longer, I would say that except for three reasons (too young - not incline to try oldies - not very open minded in general), there is NO reason whatsoever you could not enjoy this work of art. There is everything in it: visuals, sounds, musics, drawings, acting, lightning, writing, poetry, catharsis... The game is very short, although it took me months when I was a teenager at the time, but don't expect to spend more than ten hours to figure it out. You can finish the game in thirty minutes, probably, but finding all there is to read, watch and learn, all left from the honest and hard working developers to the audience, would take you these ten hours.The story is fantastic, the acting is brilliant, the world conception is marvelous, the psychology behind all the story is genius. Plus it works without any tweak on modern computers, AND you get a nice making of bonus with cool devs talking.In other words, and for real gamers: remember Sanitarium? This game is not a point and click, but it will give you the same impact. That's right, the impact of the word: masterpiece.DO RECOMMEND!"

,Recommended,255960,26338654,"Posted: 31 October, 2016",all,Borumm,If you like corny FMV games you'll enjoy this one. Even if you don't I think it's worth it to experience being a roach you get to see what life is like behind the walls of your home and what things look like from a smaller scale. It's a lot like Honey I Shrunk the Kids in that regard.There isn't really anything like this game so for people looking for new experiences I would reccomend this game. It's worthwile to use a guide though. It didn't lessen my enjoyment using a walkthrough while playing since I just wanted to travel through the world of Bad Mojo instead of looking for some sort of adventure game challenge.
,Recommended,255960,23673340,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,Kailen,"Very amusing little puzzle game.  Plays as a bit of a Myst clone, only instead of point and click you have to control the character as if it were an adventure game.  So shades of King's Quest and the like.  All in all, most of the puzzles are easy enough to solve, there was one that required a number, but the location of said number was fairly obscure.  The theme is very unique, you play as a person turned into a cockroach.  The art style is grimy and dirty and fits perfectly with the game.  There's some gloriously cheesy mid-90's FMV acting, but even there the production values are pretty high with good sets etc.  Yea, I totally recommend trying this one out!There's also a substancial amount of bonus material that the store page doesn't seem to mention.  If you browse to the game's directory, and explore the ""Bonus Content"" directory, it includes things like the soundtrack, making of videos, commentaries, hints, pictures (concept art, wallpaper, avatar pictures), even some source code (looks like just stuff to make it run on newer systems, not the entire game's code)."
