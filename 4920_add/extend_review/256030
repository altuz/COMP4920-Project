But what is at the heart of every game like this, combat.  Now I will say, combat in itself is just as well done as the rest of the game.  However, someone on the dev team needs to understand the importance of mob spawning and placement. For me this is where the game literally falls apart.   there is almost no space to manuver in this game as it is, then add the mob spawn logic.  Take two steps and mobs spawn in around you in a circle and attack, This is a game where tactics do not exist, its simplhy a matter of stepping forward, getting encircled with spiders, taking boat loads of un dodgeable damange and spamming pots, lots and lots of pots.I find in annoying enough to stop playing even though the rest of the game is literallh a masterpiece.  All I can ask is that as you redesign and update your game for the re-release, try to create a more fluid combat dance between the player and the mobs.  Dont rely on cheap spawning tactics to create articfically difficulty.There is also an abundency of console type boss fights, tiny little rooms, no where to move, lighting fast bosses that do tons of damage.  There is no pacing to these events they are just pot swigging marathons, or as suggested in the loading tips, over level your character and go back to fight bosses.Unfortunantely I will have to give this game a thumbs down.  I am the owner of just about every top down Diable style game available on steams, literally dozens and there is somthing magical about a game when they can get mob spawning, combat fighting spaces, mob and player speeds, functional CC down riight.  I just dont think this game has that criticall component.  What a shame."

This may be a product of not playing the game enough but in most games I play, by 4 hours you usually know where the game is going.So this is what I know so far and what I believe people will find useful if they are looking at buying this game. I bought this game because I wanted to try another arpg that marketed itself as being different from the usual model. This game does that. It is story driven and has characters that very much have their own flare and personalities. The voice acting is very good and the dialogue always feels important and interesting.  However, I feel that even a story driven game should have fun and interesting combat, or at least cool combat animations. In this game I never found myself saying ""Holy (explicative) that was awesome"" or ""This move is fricking amazing"". Instead I found myself mumbling ""ok, this a stun/aoe"" and ""Im not sure why I even picked up this second skill"". I tried using both the archer and the barbarian and although the archer seemed a little bit more versatile, the abilities used still seemed lack luster. And maybe this was by design in an effort to make a more grounded game. But in my defense I bought a game where you play as a soul devouring demon who controls/ binds with souls of fallen heroes, and that just sounded a lot more awesome than it turned out to be combat wise. Im choosing to leave out anything dealing with bugs and technical issues because the developers do seem to care whether or not the game runs well and have taken the time to roll out a few updates. For that reason I wont judge the game based on how many times it crashes. But I will say this, when a game comes out of early access, beta, or whatever testing phases it uses and is marketed as a finished game, it should be finished. It shouldn't be released with known crashes or unfinished graphical features (like  vsync). With that said the game is under 35 and should get a little slack for technical issues. For me personally it's the combat that kills this game. I plan on finishing the game after the crashes get fixed because I spent money on the game and because it does have a really interesting story line. But if I had known now what it plays like then I woulnt have spent more than $10 on it.So in conclusion, if you dont care too much about combat or gameplay and mostly judge games based on story and concepts, then this is a game you will love. However if you are like me and want a visceral combat experience where you can feel progression at every skill point, then you will be underwhelmed by this game. As a general piece of advice, give this game another month or so to iron out tech issues. This will be a good game for some and a poor game for others, unfortunately for this reviewer it just wasn't up to snuff. The only reason I chose ""No"" is because I had to choose something and I wouldn't tell my friends that this is a must have. If you need a number this is a 60/100 and thats assuming tech issues get resolved. I hope this review was helpful(:"
,Not Recommended,256030,13086398,"Posted: 25 November, 2014",all,Dave B,"Warning: Stream edition is missing retail gameplayI’m not talking about the game being release in two halves. There’s actually locked doors and three quests in part 1 that can only be opened in the retail edition. It’s not available on the steam version, even to earliest of the early adaptors like myself. And there's nothing in the game to tell you this, so expect to waste time backtracking because you don't know which bits you were supposed to come back to with your new shiny, and which bits were never meant for you at all.Chapter 1 is great. There’s a good mixture of combat and plot. Chapters 2 & 3 and the other hand is just combat. The combat’s not bad, but that’s really all there is to Chapters 2 & 3 so if you looking for something other than grind, stay away.I played through to the end, but wished I hadn’t bothered.Pros:Excellent art design. Each level is both pretty and functional. The ability to switch to a ‘ghost world’ gets twice the millage out of each level without it feeling tired or forced.The ability to switch between characters is quite cool and well implemented. All characters receive XP whether they are in the party or not, so there’s no penalty for trying one out. The characters each have a distinct feel even though they all fall into one of three classes (ranged, magic, melee).Bosses are varied and feel special.In the configuration settings, you can change the ‘highlight loot/interactive area’ key from push-and-hold to toggle-on-and-off.Tom Baker voice over.[b[Cons:[/b]There are no movement keys. It’s right click to move, left click to attack. This makes most combat stationary and a battle of health bars rather than something dynamic and exciting. There is some ability to kite by switching between ghost and meat characters (and you’ll be doing that a lot in chapter 3).Some of the later levels have you backtracking across multiple levels without fast travel no apparent reason.The game engine does not support multiple CPUs or GPUs (source: dev posting in the comments). My 4 core, GTX 970 SLI config could barely manage 40FPS on max settings.Mob difficulty level is all over the place, typically at the start of a new chapter.Skill are unbalanced."
,Recommended,256030,10461203,"Posted: 13 June, 2014",all,Exfauxsure,"PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW BEFORE JUST LOOKING AT MY RECOMMENDATION!Honestly, from the little I've played of this so far, I'm thoroughly intrigued as to where the game will go. I can't say it's the most original feeling experience as it is basically a ""Diablo clone"" (as much as I hate to use that term), but it does enough of its own thing to warrant my time, I think. Besides, if you're going to go for a style of game play, you could do a whole hell of a lot worse than iterating on solid design to begin with.PLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME! If you're wanting to try this game to see what it's about, maybe watch a YouTube video or something first as I can't recommend the game for $26.99 as is. That being said, if you're like me and are able to look past some major game flaws with an open mind while being a fan of the genre, this isn't the worst purchase on Steam.As is, I would recommend having a decent rig for playing, since there are currently no options to ""tune down"" any of the graphic settings beside resolution to work well for lower end machines and even on my high-mid machine it chugs like a beast due to lack of optimization (that will surely come much later). I streamed my first impressions of the game and I feel like that was a mistake and may have made the game look much more choppy than it actually was, but I feel like the most I got at any point in time playing was 25-30fps. It isn't unplayable, but added to the sluggish movement feel and kinda janky item pickup, some parts felt more arduous than they will when I can tweak the settings to make sure I get my full 60fps minimum.TL;DR Don't be silly and think you'll get an objectively ""good"" product right now for the price, but there is enough in here to show glimpses of a future solid title.P.S. Shameless video play plug and to the devs, I'm sorry my streaming made the game look like it performs worse than it actually does :-(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HblXseaXGzs"

But overpowered werewolves are more of a chore then fun to kill, especially when they are constantly regenerating health. I could handle one of them, but when you have two or more chasing you down this is NUTS.To the games' credit:  great graphics, excellent music and sound, good game play and loot.  Please fix your game.  I cannot recommend until then,."

Excellent story line thus far, flexibility in how you approach things, and an innovative method of dealing with a ""party"" type situation without having a party following you.  You are able to switch back and forth between playing a soul devourer and his many meat puppets.  The game pay reminds me on some levels of the genius of the old game Soulbringer,in that you uncover things and sometimes need to accomplish objectives both on the mortal plane, and on the astral.The environments are stunningly beuatiful, especially when playing using the DirectX 11 drivers.  This is an amazingly well-done game.  This is not your typical hack and slasher.  Some moral grey areas throughout on potential situations.  I have not played far enough through with multiple playthroughs to determine how this affects the overarching story or potential endings yet, but I cannot wait to keep on plugging away and explore those sorts of options.

,Recommended,256030,16711966,"Posted: 25 June, 2015",all,Kei,"NOTE: I'm still playing this game, and haven't finished the first book yet, I'll probably update this review as soon as I've finished my first playthrough of book 1.Also, I'm trying to keep this as spoiler-free as possible, so some things may be worded quite vaguely. My apologies for that.Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms is one of the most interesting games I've ever played. The gameplay is similar to that of Diablo 3, in that you have the same camera perspective and you basically spam your abilities to kill enemies. However, this game does it with a simple twist, the ability to move between two realms at will.What this simple mechanic does, is that you actually need to think whenever you're fighting against a group of enemies, as some of them are exclusive to one of either realms. I thoroughly enjoyed battling a boss, and using this to my advantage.The story of the game has been pretty good so far, and the characters that you control are quite interesting. The fact that your characters have their very own story adds a huge amount of replayability to the game which is really nice.Despite all the good points though, some players may not enjoy the game that much due to the rather slow progression in stats and power, I haven't had any trouble with enemies on normal mode yet, but you don't feel very powerful either, since you'll die quickly if you stay within the range of your enemies' attacks. Do take note that I play a ranged character, it is possible that melee characters do not suffer from this issue.I personally believe that the slow progression is kind of nice. It really is a great feeling when you finally level up, like you really accomplished something. And usually you do notice a change in power due to the scaling as you invest skill points into skills or passives.Graphics-wise the game is absolutely gorgeous, particle effects in combat are not over the top and flow nicely. The environmental art within the game is great too. Alongside the music and narrative it really immerses yourself within the game.One should most definitely buy this game if they enjoy a good story with a large amount of side-quests and simple, yet mechanically interesting combat.TL;DRIf you would enjoy a game with a fair amount of exploration and story. Buy this."

Yes, it is Early Acess (pre-alpha), combat feels a little slugish, same for picking up items, art work (for what ive seen) has been awesome, sound track has been engaging, need click+hold attacking. On the upside, switching between members is fun, seeing both the light/shadow sides and being able to level both seperate is a great thing to have. In its current state, I'd give it a 7/10, but I strongly believe it will only get better from here."

The UI, the character inventory, the crafting, the voice acting, the graphics, the writing, game performance are all just great.  I've experienced no bugs or glitches, at all.  And, above all, the game is fun.  The combat isn't revolutionary, or even evolutionary, but it works and it's fun in the way it's implemented.  The difficulty on normal is reasonable.  There's a nice strong story, too, which is tied to your character's backstory.  This is just the game I've been looking for; all fun and no headaches."

So far I have beat this game with the merchant king and now I am working on the enchantress. this is obviously a beta version of the game but is well worth the money upfront. There are some minor improvements to the mechanics of the game but everything else is outstanding especially the graphics and effects especially for a non main stream or popular name like Blizzard.Con's:The mechanical issues I have quams with are as follows:#1. When holding down your left mouse button to walk automatically if your mouse cursor by chance hits a destroyable object (which happens every friggen single time!!) will cause the character to pause and shoot or melee that target......this is a major ""no, no""#2. Spontaneous game crashes. Luckily every time the game crashed I had saved my progress at major points of the game before the incent but still cost me many wasted minutes. This is also a major ""no no""!!!.#3. Unlike games like diablo 3 when you press your button to attack a target then quickly press the button again to attack a different target in the middle of your attack and executes instantly to attack the other target after hitting the original target. This game has characters that execute 10x slower than the characters in Diablo so when you predetermine your target then change targets in the middle of your execution your character pauses and does not execute the original target then restarts the movement to attack the new target........This is super annoying for D3 players like myself but this setting is much more realistic so if you appreciate the realism vs the unrealistic stuff like D3 then this game is for you.Pro's:#1: The Price of the game is low for this quality of a game.#2. The music & the character voices/material is great.#3. The graphics are very detailed and realistic.#4. The gameplay and story line is very unique in it's genre.#5. This game has great potential."

You end up pretty often hitting nothing but Air, if you get swarmed by multiple Enemies at once. Also, it seems that quite often you just hang, and then you end up dying, because your Character decided to do nothing.Running: While that System is nothing you should think its buggy, it is still buggy. Because you find yourself a few Times just getting stuck on Things .. and yes, you can even get stuck into NOTHING. Then you just cant move anymore, no back or forth.Content: Here comes my biggest complain. The Steam Version of the Game is incomplete. When you finally end up killing the ""End-Boss"", you find yourself with a few unfinished Quests that lead into nothing. There are several locked Doors/Gates that you cant open. Missing Boss in the Steam Version. On the other Hand, if you have the Retail Version of this Game, all those Quests are doable, and you can open the Gates/Doors.Crashes: You experience random and non-random Crashes all over the World. There are several Hotspots in the World, where the Game just crash, and it does this every time you get close to this Point. And the Random Crashes happen also, all the Time. So you can repeat or walk over the Map all over again, just to end up having another Crash.As of now: Dont buy this Game, at least not on Steam, if you want the Full Experience of the Game.Additional Information: For Achievement-Hunters - DO NOT BUY.

I'm one of the half dozen or so people who purchased the classic ARPG Heretic Kingdoms at release and enjoyed it quite a bit, so I was excited for this somewhat belated semi-sequel (same world, different characters). It really delivers.It has all the appeal of the original and its bizarre, dark anti-theistic world of the Heretic Kingdoms setting as well as great art design and graphics, rock solid controls and an interesting combat mechanic whereby you can change to a different character/form on the fly. Each form has different strengths and weaknesses and multiple ones are frequently viable in a given area. Bosses are fun, enemies are challenging without being overly difficult and all-in-all this is just a great game.Just an FYI, this game series is single-player and campaign oriented and plays more like the Dungeon Siege or Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance than the more loot-driven, frequently multi-player oriented games like the Diablo series or Titan Quest.Additionally, Book 2 has not been released.

There are tons of good ideas here, as well as old classic ones, all great reasons to buy and enjoy this game. I'll list a few of them below.First of all, this game is a classic call back to titles like the original Diablo, Ultima, Might and Magic and Golden Axe. I say that because the plot, characters, items and abilities are reminiscent of a simpler formula for what made roleplaying games fun: Genuinely mysterious plots, needing to pick through lots of containers, trying to find ways through locked doors, tons of areas to explore and re-explore, life-threatening bosses, and cool new upgrades in each place you visit - All tropes we're familiar with, and elements we've largely taken for granted in today's world of grindy hyper-fantasy turbo-speed action games.To talk about the new, the first thing you'll notice is that the pacing in combat is intentionally slower than most modern games because you actually have tons of different things you can do at any given time. The primary gimmick is that you can switch between characters at will but only play one at a time, which has a great justification in the game, which also justifies the manner in which you heal your party, the purposing behind which is very well thought out and works very well. The game opens up and starts throwing lots more monsters and compromising situations at you as you acquire new abilities and party members, which you will begin to switch between often. Once you start to learn the combos you can do and the pace at which you can do them, strategies for dealing with different kinds of badguys become endless and the gameplay becomes very rewarding.Add on top of this that the voice acting and plot is excellent despite having been developed in Europe and the color and environments are nothing short of beautiful, and you will spend a lot of time enjoying this game. The only complaints here are that the game starts off maybe a little too slow, and there isn't enough to do as far as playing the first character you start out as for the first hour or two. After hour two, the game becomes much more interesting. An ideal price for this title would be between 10 and 15 dollars as of when this review is going up. I'm only a quarter of the way through and I have to say, if the game is as long as I believe it is and keeps presenting new and interesting challenges along the way, it would be worth playing through at least once even at full price.TLDR, 8 out of 10. I would say this is a very good break-out title for the developer Games Farm, and we'll be expecting to see bigger, faster, harder and better from them in the future."

You get lots of characters to choose from, all different with their own novel little twists, and you can switch freely between them (The devourer and up to 3 souls in combat, but you can return to the realm of shadows to change your line-up).Combat... if only it played with the fluidity and sense of impact that League of Legends has it would be stellar but sadlyit doesn't. Your character seems to just plant himself in the ground when you use an ability, combat animations are underwhelming and enemy’s don't react much until you kill them when there is a bit of a ragdoll effect.I am still going to give this a thumbs up because I can see myself finishing it because of the story.Devs if you read this please do yourselves a favour and make the combat fun and fluid with impactful abilities, fix that and you have a guaranteed sale for every expansion from this arpg player."

So to force diversity the only difference is some charatcers are tanky and others do elemental damage that you sometimes need to bypass resists to other damage types. I think they only programmed the 5 attacks and just used different graphics for each character to make them different.I could have played the game, got over the generic loot treadmill and mediocre story.

76561197994581058,Recommended,256030,34996056,Posted: 16 September,all,GenericName,"The mixed rating on this game is not diserved anymore.  When the game first came out it pretty much dumped a load on early access gamers.  So unsurprisingly its ratings went to hell.  It has fixed this, mainly by seperating with the company that was controling its purse strings so to speak.  And then treating early access gamers better, but to be fair if you've moved on your not likely to take the time and now give the game a good rating.That said though, i am not claming this is perfect.  It suffers from rough edges i'd say.  It can't seem to figure if it wants enemies to respawn.  Loot drops can be pretty bad, which wouldn't be too bad but their is no late game town.  They added a merchant which helps but it really isn't the same.  Their are of course bugs, but nothing game breaking anymore.  The game overall just seems to lack good planning later on, the final boss is fun but before that it feels amatuerish in design.Regardless of that, the game is very unique in that you basically can shape shift and also move between two slightly different maps.  Plus its a solid hack and slash game.My only real grip with this game is it ends on a cliff hanger and their is no sequel in sight yet."

,Recommended,256030,23494749,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,The Gemlin,"Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms (we'll call it S:HK) was that game in the steam store that I was curious about, but wasn't certain if it was worth the $20 price. After finally giving in and buying it, I found it to be a pretty fun spin on the arpg formula.S:HK takes place in a fantasy world with a pretty neat concept. There's magic, but no religion (from what I gathered, people were abusing religion for power so others rose against them and wiped it out), so no clerics or paladins here. As the description tells you (or maybe you ignored the description and came down to the reviews immediately you little rebel), this game has you take on the role of a demon known as the Devourer. Honestly, that is what made me want to buy this game. As the Devourer, you consume the souls of the dead and turn them into puppets. These puppets are pretty much copies of whoever or whatever was consumed, but now under the Devourer's control.The concept of the Devourer plays into the mechanic that makes this game unique. The puppets make their way through the regular world while the Devourer explores the shadow version. You end up switching between puppets and the Devourer to bypass obstacles, find secrets,escape from one world to another to avoid a bad situation, or to kill extra enemies for those delicious experience points. You will start with one puppet and the Devourer, and you'll find others throughout the game as things go on. This is where I have to commend the developers for making such unique playable characters for and arpg. I won't spoil what they are, but, believe me, you won't be expecting some of these. This creates a cool dynaimc where the player won't run through the game with only one character, but rather switch between them to fit the situation. Maybe you'll use a mage to take out a group of smaller enemies before switching to the Devourer to take out a shaman without the others interfering, then proceeding to switch to an archerto kite and kill some of the stronger enemies, and finishing with your warrior to plow through what's left. It's a fun and engaging mechanic that makes me want to keep coming back to find new and useful combinations, and it definitely hold this game up. Levels are shared between characters, so don't worry about one getting ahead of others.The game can be pretty short if you ignore some sidequests and know what to do, but I feel that this works to its advantage. The game has plenty of points where decisions affect the story and playing through with different puppets and different decisions adds a ton of replay value. I see people complaining about the cliffhanger ending, but I honestly feel that it's warranted. There's plenty here, and the developers likely wanted to send this out to see how it goes before investing more into a project that might fail.The game is not perfect though. It has a few bugs, and sometimes it isn't clear what the player is supposed to do at some points. The save system can hurt at some points, but that's only if you forget to quciksave every now and then (although i understand why trapping the player with frequent autosaves could lead to issues as well). The main issue is the amount of walking you end up doing. There are points scattered around the world that you can fast-travel between, but, after you use one, you have to walk across an entire map to go into a dungeon and beat it to do your quest, then retrace all of your steps without enemies to occupy you on the way back. Also, there are quests that you either won't want to complete (I will not put myself through that Call To Arms quests, and nothing can make me) or quests that you can't complete until the next part comes out.I feel I should address a common complaint I've seen in reviews and say that the attacking system works fine for me. Left-click on an enemy to attack, hold it down to keep attacking, and hold shift to attack while stationary. I had very problems, and even those were just trying to target the right person in a group of enemies.All in all, S:HK isn't a perfect game, but it has a good amount of content, interesting concept, as well as a unique and dynamic mechanic that make it well worth that $20 price tag( that's like one meal at Olive Garden for at least 22 hours of entertainment). If you're a fan of arpgs or just curious about the concept in general, I'd definitely recommend it."

Twice the fun, right?Two worlds, 1 ShadowNot really. The two worlds thing is nice in theory, but it ends up being a chore. I have to wander around an area as 1 dude then wander around as the other. Sure, it's not that bad and I could easily deal with it by switching it up while I'm still in the same area, right? Both sets of characters take FOREVER to get around. They're far too slow in general. Later on I unlocked an Archer type dude who was ever so slightly faster and it still took far too long to wander around. This is an Action, Hack'n'Slash, right? You know, ARPG like Diablo? It sure doesn't feel or act that way. I literally looked around for a Diablo 2 style Sprint button or toggle; didn't find one. If you're not going to give us the means to move faster then at least make the characters FAST themselves, geez.Hows the Voice Acting?The voice acting is grand! It's great to hear everything instead of having to read literally everything. Sadly, the sound mixing is terrible. Voices either cut off other voices or are automatically played right after the next even if you heard it mutiple times already. There is large amount of NPC's that only have a single thing to say. Some voice volumes are unbalanced and are often too loud when compared to voicing before it or during. For example, I was talking to Morphew and there was constantly a weird busy market place sound effect that contains some yelling that would continue to pop up as he was speaking forcing me to read the text instead of hearing the lovely voice acting.Hows the rest of the sound?Annoying as heck! Just playing the very beginning-ish area with the Shadow guy and hearing the Soul sound effect over and over at the exact same volume each time without any fading or canceling, was like nails on a chalkboard. Then you have mutiple enemies all playing the same loud dying sound effect as well, over and over again everytime. It reminded me of bad Tablet games where they just let the sound effects cut in and out without any control or balance but it wasn't enough to abandon ship just yet. The only good thing sound wise was the music and how it would change based on what world you're in.Cut Scene VideosI have no idea what's going on with them but they look to be pre-recorded poorly rendered videos and watching them on my large monitor felt as if I was rubbing the screen with my eyeballs. Crazy pixelation and overall poor quality.Is there anything else ""good""?Believe it or not, the story. I was more invested in the story of who is the Hooded Man, what happened to Kalig and overall my evil shadowy self then I ever was in Diablo 3. There also a few quests that seemed entirely optional and gave a worth while reward at the end of it. However, the ""search for intel"" related quests were utterly terrible pieces of nonsense. It went on for too long and the quest markers kind of broke during it. The UI is also very good in most areas. The inventory UI seems a tad large and in your face for my liking but at least it was easy to be effective with it. I could tell it was really trying to have only a single window for shops, inventory and character equipped items.Bugs and GlitchesYeah, it should be noted that there are some bugs and glitches. Some areas that look walkable aren't or the pathing is off. Some times an enemy can sit in an area where you're not able to walk towards and thus cannot attack them. Often the screen seems to have visual tears even with V-Sync on and having tweaked the settings.What made me quit out?I ignored everything else mentioned above in order to play the game and see what it had to offer. Again, keeping in mind that I really wanted to enjoy and love the game.The combat is what killed it for me. Besides the fact that the game thought shoving me onto a level 19 character with a bunch of skills that I didn't know what any of them did was a good idea when It wasn't... I could never get past the strange disconnection from the characters. Every attack feels as if it's turn based instead of an ARPG. I walk over to get in range and stand there spamming the attack button, waiting for the attack animation to start up and then attempt to hit them until X target dies. It annoys me how long it takes between each attack and that movement is obviously slow for only you as enemies can zip around while you're still starting up your attack. In short, it's mind numbingly slow. I used the Shadow guy and Kalig, both felt the same. Both had the same issue. Only Kalig had it worse. His attack animation is so long that it could easily be canceled out of. No damage is done to your target when this happens. It makes the fact that you can MISS even more annoying.Even just breaking a bunch of Urns and Barrels takes far too long. The slow nature of attacking makes everything related to it a chore or a test of will. Skills? Nah, they're just as slow and awkward. Skills and normal attacks can hit targets that should clearly be out of range. Some times your first skill as quite the long cooldown making combat entirely about single targeting every enemy.The combat is so slow nothing I do with skills feels rewarding. There is no satisfaction from using an AoE skill to kill off a number of enemies as I have to wait to do anything at all times."

Not ""largely unfinished"" in the sense that it doesn't conclude, but unfinished insomuch as the game yields 5-10 hours of gameplay in total.  That's it.The mechanics of swapping between the shadow/real realm, and swapping puppets in combat to chain constant stuns is interesting, but that interest is short lived.  Once you get into a rhythm of chaining two or three stuns between your puppets, you infinitely lock down enemies.  Bosses aren't much of a challenge when you can ensure they never move, let alone attack, for as long as you can keep swapping and stunning.Once Book II is released, and an initial hand at balancing passes over the game, it may be worth a buy if it's on sale.  For right now this is not worth putting down the money."
