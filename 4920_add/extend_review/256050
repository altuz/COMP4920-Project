Now if only the tycoon part was good.There are only a few rides that you can build, and while they are all very polished, most of them operate the exact same way.There is a huge lack of rides, shops and customization options compared with RCT, which came out years ago.Also, the maps are so small that you probably couldn't fit all the rides in your park. So in the end, all the park you will make will pretty much look the same.I wish I could find something positive to say about this game but I can't. Not worth the price,  not worth the time.Stick with your favorite version of Rollercoaster Tycoon."

I immediately got flashbacks to Theme Park world, you got 20 rides per theme section. One thing: You got 4 themes so you've got a lot more rides...The Coasters: Horrible, just plain awful. The coasters just fall and go up, without any speed loss/gain. You can't even make loopings... No loopings in a Coaster Game... Even a simple banked bend isn't possible. What were the designers thinking?The facilities: The restaurant's are very bad designed and just plain simple. There isn't even a person standing in the stand.The scenery: There is almost no scenery, and the scenery there is is very dull. You can't even make simple buildings. I mean Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 from the year 2002 has buildings?!Path's: Just awful to lay down. Making a square (And i mean like a town square) is a very hard job. And serious: No queues. A Theme Park without queues sound like dream in real life, but it's just terrible that you don't have them in the game.The AI: Plain dumb, worst routing ever.Sound: There isn't any sound. No people screaming/lauging/talking. No ambiance, yeah some crickets/birds... And the music is terrible. There are only 2 songs and they repeat and repeat until the universe implode.Conclusion: Don't buy it. It's like i've been ripped off... 2/10"

As it stands it's nothing but a low effort immitation.I think the devs planned to do more with this game but gave up, released it as is and asked a new release price for it. In addition to content it lacks polish and heart. It's not terrible mind you, it's decidedly below average and overpriced to boot.If you are waiting for new theme park game to be a worthy successor to any of the well knon tycoon series... Well... Keep on waiting, you wont find what you are looking for here.Edit: 2 years later and Atari is set to launch rollercoaster tycoon 4 and I have to say it paints Adventure Park in a better light. If nothing else I have to respect b-Alive's production values. It actually ""looks"" like a better game then RCT4 and is less broken. Still not a touch on RCT3 and the RTC3 devs are about to release Planet Coaster as a worthy successor so I still suggest giving Adventure Park a miss."

I really like this game... it's like them park world but better"
,Not Recommended,256050,7882796,"Posted: 2 December, 2013",all,✫ Aionion,"The actual tutorial, assuming you just go straight through it can probably be wrapped up in about 15-20 mins. You can however, continue playing the tutorial map as long as you wish.Also, while I try to be as objective as I can by providing examples, there's still a lot of subjective preferences and expectations here on my part, so keep that in mind if determining whether or not the game is for you based on my feedback.General InfoIn the tutorial you start out by buying staff to clean up an island you just bought to make your theme park. At this time there is only the gardner, cleaner, and 5 levels of technicians (different skills levels for complexity of rides).You'll end up learning about the finances, services, decorating, keeping visitors happy, missions, creating coasters, etc.You can rotate the camera, zoom up or down all the way to the ground level. While on the ground level you can ""walk"" through the park...see the park as your patrons see it.  You can also ride the rides by selecting the ride, then going to it's ""street level"" view. This has been done in a few other games, so it's good to see it here too. Screenshots posted.In the tut, the last thing you learn is how to create coasters. You select a specific coaster to build, then you lay down the tracks yourself. You increase or decrease the angle of track by holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse. It uses a waypoint system to make things easier if you like. Building the track is intuitive and fun, easy to do and you can make it as complex as you like, however,you cannot create loopswhich is a disappointement to many.As your park gets higher ratings more options become available to you. New rides, decorations, services, etc... Also, new challenges will appear in the mission list (create a ride w/ x g-force rating, create a 3-star ride, have $x monthly income, etc.).You also have the ability to modify terrain itself. You can elevate it, decrease it, flatten it, add water, etc... So you have quite a bit of control here.Game AssetsIn Free Build mode, you can unlock every asset in the game from the start (which is not the case with Campaign mode).  You have about 6 maps to work with, some larger than others, each of a different environment (forest, desert, etc.).Here is the breakdown of the available assets of the game:21 rides (includes all kiddie rides and larger coasters). This isn't very much IMO. Now youcancompletely customize the coasters with your own build (and name), and even add event facilities (tunnels, explosions, etc...), but still, there are only 21 basic types of rides.5 path types (stone, wood, etc.)30 plants/trees8 different fence types, each with their own style gate (including metal, wood, glass, stone, etc...)5 Entertainment Facilities - laid down next to the tracks (explosions, tunnels, etc..)13 Terrain types12 Service buildings (bathrooms, stores, food, etc). They for some reason include benches, but i make a distinction here since benches are free to use by the visitors where as well other services aren't3 bench types with about 20 variations (slight style change or color variation)2 trash can types, each with different color variations3 types of staff (Cleaner, Gardener, Mechanic). There are 5 skill levels of mechanics though, which correspond to the complexity rating of the ride.  There are no mascots or anything else. No animals, nothing other than these 3.34 decorations (torches, stones, skulls, rock formations, etc.)IMO, it's a little lacking. It could use some more types of staff, maybe more rides (DLC at some point?), fireworks system, more entertainment facilities, etc.It is enough to have fun with, but for hardcore players, it may not be enough. As more of a casual player, and one more focused on creativity than min-maxing, it's fine, particularly at the current price point of the game.  It is also an area where the devs could release some DLC to add to the game. I have no idea if they'd do that or not though.The GoodGraphicsGraphically, the game is nice. It is similar to, but not quite as polished as Sims 3 graphics. Not that S3 graphics are revolutionary, just that it works for the game style that it  is.You can select ""User Defined"" for graphic settings, and from there you haveplentyof graphic options available (see my screenshot in the hub or my profile). I was quite surprised to find this actually given how seemingly simplistic the Settings Menu is at first glance. So from where, I can tweak as needed, to provide the best possible experience.I'm running with an AMD 6800 GT Series (don't know exact model, sorry) with 1GB vid memory, 8GB 3DDR, Intel i7920. I can play Sims 3 at max settings just fine. However, I have to tweak the User Defined settings a bit here to get it to run smoothly. I'm personally fine with doing so but you should know that the default setting may be a bit rough, so be prepared to tweak as you need them.StaffHiring, placing, and directing the new employee  is quite intuitive and a step up from other similar games that I recall.  Before I place the staff member and while I'm holding him (ala Sims 3 style), it shows the green border area of where he will be restricted to working. I can drop him anywhere,and he will stay w/i this boundary.  I can increase this area (simply by clicking on him, then on the increase area button) or decrease it. I can easily relocate him to a new area as well.  It's simple to do and lets me have decent control. See screenshot.""The Bad""In ""quotes"" because these areminor annoyancesvs significant issues that negatively affect the game play experience. See the next section for that.The UII don't care too much for the Menu design nor the dialog boxes. It's very outdated IMO.  It works, it will not complicate the game unecessarily but itisa little distracting to me personally. See my screenshots (in my profile) for examples.The building options are fine however. It's like they used 2 different ui designers. Quite odd.No Queue LinesUnlike other games in this genre, you have no control over queue lines.  What happens is that they go into the ride waiting area (which is a part of the ride build itself). Youdosee them standing there, waiting to get on the ride when it becomes available.To be clear, you don't  create an area for lines. The ride ""hub""  does that by itself internally.Setting PricesNot only do you price out admission, but each ride. OK...some parks still exist that do that (most large parks do not however). But pricing out bathroom use? Makes me feel like I'm runing a low end, small town, wandering fair or something.The UglyDynamic BuildingEssentially...it doesn't exist. Once you drop something...it cannot bemoved. You have to sell it outright then buy another one to replace it (even if you only need to move the item 1 square over). I dropped a trash can in an area where later in the game it prevented a large ride from being built. I missed this by 1 grid square.  The only way to resolve this is to sell/bulldoze the trash can. I still needed a trash can in the area though...so I had to buy a new one. This is very unrealistic of course, and highly annoying."

Not only it runs really choppy, even with a computer way above the requirements, it is incredibly boring, dull and poorly designed.Terrible awful graphics and poor sound effects.Can't even be considered a shadow of RCT. RCT3 is 100% better and cheaper!"

While roller coaster tycoon is a blast putting up all these rides with lots of imagination, I get really bored of like ""put down our preset rides"". Secondarily I don't have the attention span to wait like 12 hours so I can come back to only like a little more money. The only thing I enjoyed was uninstalling.Ps: I only have like 20 hours cause I just left it running to get my money up cause, surprise! You don't gain money when you leave it off. So they expect you to watch your money slowly go up at only x2 speed."
