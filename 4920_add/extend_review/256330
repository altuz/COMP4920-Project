The driving feel is awesome, the cars react how they should. The stages are simply amazing, they can be difficult and tight but that's what I love of rally racing. Multiplayer is great fun, I can only hope it keeps a good healthy community.Comparing this to Codemasters rally titles:Handling: WRC 4Stages: WRC 4Sound: DiRT 2/3Graphics: DiRT 2/3Codemasters take the sound and graphics department by far but gameplay is definitely better in WRC 4. I'm happy the official WRC titles made it to steam, totally worth the day 1 purchase."
,Recommended,256330,7873324,"Posted: 1 December, 2013",all,MAXLD,"Is it the best rally game ever? No. Is it a decent rally game? Yes. Is it better than previous WRC games? It is, specially than ""WRC 3"" which had an insulting ""Career"" mode. This one has a proper WRC career from WRC3 (2WD) to WRC main class, is way more realistic in that department than previous ones...Car choices are limited to the WRC3, WRC2 and WRC classes, there's no GroupB this time, no classic GroupA/90's WRC and no classics. But that's not a big disappointment, because in previous WRC games their driving was not that great, and the choices/licenses were also very limited.Some of the Rallys are much improved in my opinion (Germany specially), although others are exactly the same as the previous game. Each one has six stages, but no closed loop super specials this time.One thing that still annoys quite a bit is the design of some stages, specially the ones with extremely slow and tight hairpins chained one after another. I mean, one or two of them I think I wouldn't be even able to do them in real life without backing up. And since the WRC cars have such high torque/acceleration they tend to lag a lot in 1st gear with considerable wheelspin there, it's quite annoying. I've cricticise previous WRC games (specially the first 2) for having very long turns and not much hairpins, but now it's the opposite, they are ridiculously tight and too close from each other.Gameplay: (my opinion is based on keyboard use only, with outside camera view) it's more of an arcade, this is far from a sim. That said, it's ""attack friendly"", quite arcadish and a bit to the loose/quick steering, which helps a lot to recover from near-crash situations, but it's a bit too much to feel in perfect control and sometimes it actually turns too much to the inside when you want to slide to the corners. You can adjust the steering lock a bit on the car setup though, but it doesn't solve the situation completely and it still feels a bit too fast. WRC 1 I think it had quite more precision and you could antecipate and attack against the clock with more confidence. That said, this one adds a bit more need to re-adjust and to fine tune your input, so it's more unpredictable. 2WD cars are much more nicer to drive, though, much less catastrophic understeer than before, and are much more worth the time spent on them (Career mode).Graphics: they get better with every game, but this is a console port (old gen), and not a very great one. Mediocre motion blur, occasional sluggish/stutter and fps drops kind of spoil the visual flow/pacing, and textures aren't great, since it's a simple port. I recommend using SweetFX tweak tool to make the graphics sharper and to boost the colour levels, it helps a bit.Sound: not great, but less annoying than the previous ones in my opinion (specially the Fiesta reving on red line). Biggest problem at the moment is a major bug that makes the game sound to turn off (normally after 3, 4 or 5 stages and before starting the next stage), requesting a game restart to fix it. You can still complete the rally/next stages but there's no sound at all.Other bugs: a few of them. Online doesn't work for a lot of people (doesn't connect), cinematics are bugged (half screen is black, some don't even seem to appear (after winning a championship, for example). Haven't seen much game braking invisible walls but some of the vegetation will certainly behave like a massive metal pole and destroy part the car in a heartbeat. It's not likely it will be all fixed soon and improved by the developer, considering the previous games, but fingers crossed.Details: well, the ""Career"" office looks decent but the email system is just the same every time (even when you win a rally), so it's 100% useless unless you haven't seen a single rally event in your entire life or haven't played a rally game before. One thing it has is the Service Park only every 2 stages which is nice and more close to reality. It also has Power Stage system like the real WRC. Flashbacks system is there but it's better and more fun to just avoid it and ramp up the AI difficulty level to have a decent challenge.Conclusion: It's a game with a limited budget and team, and it's clearly aimed for consoles first, PC later. So it has the usual drawbacks of a port. Does it make a better job than other rally games out there? Well, there's no other decent rally games out there that deserve your attention if you're a rally fan. And I mean proper rally / WRC, not ""gymkhana stuff"". Let's say it's a bit close to ""Colin McRae"" games back in the day, although it's debatable.That's why I do Recommend this game. It's the only proper Rally game out there and it's a game I enjoy playing even though it's not perfect. Just pick it up depending on the price you're willing to risk."
,Not Recommended,256330,8891597,"Posted: 28 January, 2014",all,john,"If feels like somehow a few developers who learned to code from YouTube coding lessons managed to cut and paste their way into something that resembles a game. I’ve tried to like this game for 3 months but its been a horrible experience overall. This is a mediocre game at best. Further, they insist on degrading the user experience further by forcing secondary logins & game registrations.  You have to create an account with them, verify you are who you say you are, and all that junk. This stuff never works right and is especially true with this game. Oh, and get this, you must use a gmail account for registration.  What?? I have gmail but still what kind of flaky spaghetti code are they writing that can only handle registrations from gmail? None of this has anything to do with the game either its just some kind of old school foolishness. They don’t even maintain multiplayer game servers (see below) which would at least be a valid excuse for this account registration nonsense. Aside from registering the game and perhaps being forced to do so multiple times because they have an inadequate registration system that forgets who you are and loses all of your game info you’ll have an even more difficult time trying to do anything that requires hitting their servers like saving race results and getting anything to do with multiplayer to work.  Even the achievements seem straight up bugged presumably because their own system doesn't remember who you are and refuses to pass on the achievement information to Steam.   Even the most mundane of achievements are hit or miss to ever get to pop.  Some basic achievement as simple as opening the car repair menu may never pop and likely a more significant one like a well earned victory achievement will never be realized.  Achievements are not that big of a deal but if you’re going to advertise them as a feature then you know what? They better work.All this developer imposed nonsense aside, the game itself is average for a 10 year old racing game. The graphics are lackluster but passable.  On the highest settings performance is almost decent BUT it looks so dated. The controls are fine using an XBOX wireless wheel or just a regular XBOX wireless game pad.  What is an issue, however, is once you do any remapping of controls the game menus do not properly represent your remappings. It uses the default prompts in the game even after you change the mappings. It’s also really easy to get stuck in the simplest of menus and the prompts just don’t make sense sometimes. Come on, at least get the MENU system right.  Then it’ll read something along the lines of press A for OK, B for Accept, etc.  So you have multiple options that would appear to do the same thing, but of course they don’t and good luck trying to figure out what the devs were thinking with that.  You can’t tell half of the time if you’re continuing to the next level or about to forfeit a race. Once in a while a button just stops working in the menus. You might have to abandon a race if, for example, you’re on the race stage info menu but the right dpad stops working so you cant navigate back to start the race or tune and repair your car. No other key or button will help either and you’re only choice is to quit which hurts your overall standings which in turn hurts your ability to advance in the campaign. Magically the button starts working again once you've done exactly the opposite of what you wanted to do. Sometimes the sound cuts out entirely. Not just the car sounds, but everything in the game including music, the crowd, etc. Silence. Then it’ll suddenly start working again 30 seconds later. These things have been complained about on the forums for months to no avail.I’ve never been able to start a multiplayer game.  The system insists I need to create an account and verify it which has been done.  I did it when I first started playing in November 2013 and have done it again since. Doesn't matter I don’t exist apparently.  None of my race results get uploaded and after every single stage of a single player race I face “an error occurred during upload” message.Support doesn't seem to exist.  They haven’t replied to any emails, facebook, or in the Steam forums. In fact I think some of my posts were wiped away instead of being replied to. The attitude feels like, “thanks for the cash, now leave us alone.”  Also I’d take whatever they put on the store page with a grain of salt. “78 courses in 13 different countries,” they say?  Well maybe if you count that ½ are just reversed courses or slight variations on the other courses. There are nowhere near 78 ORIGINAL courses. Also from the store page, “Online multiplayer mode for up to 16 people” but this is from their own readme: “ARC 4 FIA World Rally Championship has no dedicated servers for multiplayer.” Huh?  So it’s peer to peer? How do you even establish a peer to peer connection if you can’t even start multiplayer mode at all?There are plenty of great racing games out there with a lower price tag. This game is a bit specialized but not terribly so that its a must have. I guess I could go on about how much I don’t like this game but if you made it this far there is no sense in beating a dead horse. Even though I got it at a big discount I don’t think I’d buy it for $1 if I knew then what I know now.  Since it will be in my Steam library for eternity I guess I’ll just rage play it whenever I’m debating buying another game that I’m on the fence about to remind me to stop buying terrible games."
,Not Recommended,256330,9419921,"Posted: 11 March, 2014",all,[OpHe] thecraicbear,"I would only recommend this game to people who are fans of the WRC, because let's face it, it's the latest and only official product we have in the gaming market right now based on the 2013 season.However, if I wasn't an avid fan of the WRC, I would avoid this game like the plague. The physics are almost wooden, the visuals fall way short of what a game of this age should live up to, the track design is boring, and on many stages the devs have just receycled a lot of the road sections because of the circuit (lazy) design of each event, the sounds are horrid and contained, and the whole experience is just flat.The career mode has been improved, and it's the mode I have played the most. However, if you're looking for longevity then the multiplayer won't give you much of that, because it's likely to not even work for a lot of people. You can create an account for it, but after a week, the chances are that the game will tell you that you don't have an account any more, and that you'll have to create a new one.I've created a new account 5 times now, and I got hit with the same message this morning, so no more for me.Terrible effort of a game. It may have been an acceptable effort in 2008, but not late 2013."

In Fact, the tracks in Colin McRae (10 years ago) were much better and so was the car handling and feel of realism. This rally game is an uninspired game with little to no love from the developers, it's just made for the $. Anno 2013 they could have delivered so much more then the old rally games, but amost non of that is presented here.Overall it is still a fun race game and worth to spend at least a couple dozen hours on if you ignore the cheesy factors, hence it's still a thumbs up."
76561198045918519,Recommended,256330,14114054,"Posted: 22 January, 2015",all,p.2501,"NOTE : My play time on this game is around 100hours, but i play offline, which steam does not count, hence the low 'time playing'.I will recommend this game, HOWEVER:There are several things very much worth taking into account if you do want to buy it.1. The co-driver is terrible. Is often quite inconsistent with the labelling (i.e a left 3 can be several different angles and speeds even though all of them are in the same stage)He will mention stuff thats irrelevant, one corner saying 'past trees' whe the tree in question is on top of an 8 foot wall, which you should also avoid but is NOT mentioned.He NEVER says anything about camber which is a little odd, he will call jumps bumps, bumps jumps and jumps as crests, with no real consistency between any of the three, and will often not mention bumps and crests that can end up with race destroying crashes.He appears to have very little idea what opens or tightens means, and will say them when not needed, and not say when he really really should have done.Rolling the car on corners that should be 'Don't cut' is quite common place, and i'm pretty sure (i've checked it twice) there is a Hairpin labelled left when its right.This can get insanely annoying after a while, when it is well known good rallying is all about good pace notes.Basically he is quite inconsistent, and you will find youself simply learning the courses by doing them, and having your own pace notes in your head for the ones he doesn't mention.There are no also no options for altering him other than timing and volume.2.The number of tracks mentioned is somewhat of a false hood, there seems to be around 3 stages for each country, that get 'combined together' into different tracks, (so the first half of one track is the last part, ot the middlle of another), and just having the reverse stage as another track (so driving the same course backwards). While the 'weather' changes, it is just a difference of colour, not sunny to raining, just midday to evening and only seems to affect lighting comditions.3. Someone else has said this aswell, this is a hairpin fest like no other, I beleive there are 2  maybe 3 courses. where the car gets to really high speeds, aside from those you will never see 5 or 6th gear. Every single course has a bucket of hairpins, and very few fast sections even in Germany, Finland, Australia and Sweden, which are kind of renowned for being very high speed events.Aside from these points the game handles quite alot better than other WRC games,  the car physics are very good and you can feel the road and behaviour of the car quite nicely.Basically this game plays quite nicley but has some not major but very irritating flaws."
,Recommended,256330,18828359,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,roughnecks,"Personal Rating: Solid Rally GameClassic Rating: ★★★★☆Latest Rally Game I played on PC was Richard Burns Rally and that was a terrific Sim; other rally games I played on Playstation are the Colin McRae's Rally Series: those were mostly Arcade games and even though you cannot compare them to RBR, I enjoyed them quite a lot at the time.Now, WRC 4 FIA WORLD RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP is a very well balanced game, it cannot be defined as a Simulator but it's not even an Arcade. I'm playing with an XBOX 360 Gamepad - no wheel here - and I'm using ""Durazno"" to change acceleration/brake from left/right trigger to right stick: I can't really get used to the triggers; I also have the handbrake an ""A"" and it feels really comfortable now.This game can be played in different ways:● Fast stage: single run on a random SS with a random car● Single Stage/Rally: you can chose a single SS or a complete rally with a car you like, in the category you like● Career Mode: You get contracts from your manager, start low in the Junior Category and go up till WRC Championship● MultiplayerOne ""big"" problem I (and many other users) have is that online features (not talking about MP, because I usually play solo) is often down: the game cannot estabilish a connection to the server and you can't save progress online - yes, you need to register an account in the setup screen, before entering the game.I bought this game on a Summer Sale, even though it was quite expensive for my wallet, but I'm very satisfied and feel like I can recommend it to anybody who likes Rally races - newbies and pros."

The multiplayer aspect of it is well and truly broken. DO NOT depend on multiplayer working at all if you purchase, despite what the product listing will tell you. Also, the game does not have a playable framerate for a lot of people regardless of GPU, unless you turn off v-sync (this is true for my HD7970).Once you turn off the v-sync and get to playing, the career mode is okay, if you don't mind a smaller-than-usual selection of rally stages. The handling of the cars is a bit arcadey but not too bad.Altogether, a very uninspired effort, and not worth the money unless heavily discounted."

There are a lot of user suggested work-arounds but the main issue with this game is that it is no longer supported by the publisher/dev studio. Besides all this annoying technical stuff, the game play is quite repetitive. So either during career mode, you will drive the same tracks again or in reverse direction. Wheel support is lousy (problems with Logitech profiler, no feedback from the surface. Gravel or mud -does not feel any difference. Jumping or crashing - no feeback to the wheel. Car handling is not realistic at all. Feels mor like arcarde). I strongly recommend to go for a more up-to-date game. I will complete the achievements and then uninstall this piece of crap."

Narrow roads were you need to be carefull not to fall on a ditch. I only reached top speed on Montecarlo and Finland.The only feature I would like to see is night stages, or more dynamic weather.---------------------------I've been playing this game for an hour, I was curious about it but due to some negative reviews I wait until I was sure. Finally I bought it last weekend in a sale and it hooked me sonce the 1st stage.I think is one of the best rally games I have played in years since my PS1 days, I have played Dirt but it never hooked me, it was good but I felt it like an arcade more than a simulator. In WRC4 I felt a great change, an licensed FIA WRC game with the official 2013 season and drivers list, WRC schedule and several car settings. A very accurate copilot comunication and real damages.Since the first minutes of the game I felt like I was playing Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 from my PS1 days, but not in terms of graphics, but in terms of gameplay, it had that exceptional rally atmosphere I remember from when I was a kid in front of the tv.Graphically I can't complain, I play in a laptop with intel hd4000 and even in low/medium settings looks great, but as I said previously the best part is gameplay."

The physics are very, very far away from being a true simulation. Front wheel drive cars do not actually behave like they are front wheel drive. You have to try to actually make them understeer. The different road surfaces do not always feel all that different either, the cars never seem to lack grip no matter what surface you are on. There are occasional issues with physics that make you spin in weird directions too ( like turning right and grabbing the handbrake and the car suddenly spins left).Car tuning is very basic and does not save between stages. Big changes to the setup of a car don't effect it that much. No choice of tires, no varible weather. I feel that even with steering lock at maximum the car always seems to react slowly to my input (xbox 360 controller). The car just turns to slowly even when you move to full travel of the stick you wait for the car to catch up.Tracks are generic, all of the stages are the previous stage reversed or pieces of the other stages combined ( apparently they all take place in the same 3-5 mile stretch of road) which is an issue I had noticed in the previous WRC games. The stages are a great deal longer than those in Dirt 3. In Dirt 3 the stages are over far to fast and never really felt like a rally, this does improve on that at least. Co-driver is not always synced with the track and can be telling you about the corner you are currently in not the next one even with maximum delay. Some of the co-driver notes are wrong also ( saying left for a right turn, hairpins when its really a 2 or 3 etc.)The Career is far to easy IMO. I have played on the hardest settings from day 1 and never really had an issue winning any stage. I was able to skip WRC3 completely and even when driving a ""lower performing"" car in the same class I had no problem beating the other cars by 10secs or more per stage.The game is not all bad, but is definitely not a great game either. There have been far better in the past, in fact I think WRC 2 was a bit better. It does trump Dirt 3 in the track length department, though I feel Dirt 3 stages are apallingly short. I wouldn't pay full price for it by any means. I think you would get a better more real experience picking up an old Colin Macrae game for Xbox than this.Pros:Decent gameplay, though not realisticnice to see actual sponsors in all divisionsStages are of decent lengthCons:physics are flakeyCo-driver is flakeyTracks seem copy pastedcareer mode feels to easybugs you about not connecting to the internet after every stagedoes not keep car setup between stages"

To be able to introduce enough new ideas on an annual basis to warrant such a yearly purchase is hard, but not impossible.Sadly the WRC series is not such a series. It was made extremely clear to me by WRC 2 (2011) that recycling content was a normal thing. Now, 4 years since the first of the WRC games I still feel the effects. But fear not, as this year’s game feels fresher than ever. Whether or not this is acceptable however, is up for debate.WRC 4 starts right out of the gate with a few very welcome changes. Gone is the boring dreary campaign that forces you to slowly crawl up the ranks. In WRC 4 you can get to the top level of the WRC in only a few hours, but also allows you to go down to the lower levels if you wish. This gives you a bit of freedom in your style of play. Like the real series, the higher the division of the WRC you compete in the more events are played out before seasons end. So by the time you compete in the top level you will be running the whole official calendar before one of these seasons is over.This year the developers went with authenticity; something that is always welcome in an official racing game. Everything from the main menu (which shuffles real slow motion shots of rallies past) to the 3 day breakdown of each rally makes the game feel more realistic then it ever has.  The stages themselves too feel far more varied. Most rallies have a unique flavour to them. Finland is flying with many blind crests, and the UK has deep mud and rain. Gone is the mirrored feeling of many of the stages in previous games. Instead you are fought with tight hairpins, and Cliffside falls. This gives the game a sharper feel of power and control; allowing the player to truly push as hard as he dares.Even though the new stages are impressive, many issues around come into focus. Some of which has never been addressed since the very first game. The main issue is replicating certain turns. Although not as bad as previous games or the horridly copied game that was WRC 2, there are still many segments that have either been seen before in previous game or are blatantly taken from other rallies! I found a perfect example with an uphill double hairpin that was in Sweden and then again in Australia. I have never had a problem with reusing the same stages in different configurations to create multiple runs of one rally, but to copy the same turns and then paste them elsewhere in a supposed other country is just irritating. It creates a heavy sense of déjà vu, creating fast player fatigue.The audio in game also creates a step forward for the series. Gone are the horrible electronic songs that felt wildly out of place and instead you hear more of a smooth sounding beat. The problem here however is that there is only one song. You think they could have added a few more. Worse than the single song soundtrack is the horrible co-driver which makes a shocking 4th straight appearance in this series. They have not changed the horrible sounding co-driver… EVER. This being a rally game your co-driver is essentially to the game. You have to listen to him to know what is coming up. The problem here is he sounds so mechanical that it is hard to get into a groove. He says turns in such a choppy fashion I am dumb founded that the developers have not made a better sounding co-driver after 4 flipping games! He also has a tendency to call notes too late causing you to miss a turn.  I guess they never expected people to drive faster than the co-driver.On a positive side for the audio is not all bad. The engine sounds are a big plus. All WRC cars sound very unique from one other making them a joy to listen to. From the smooth gear shift of the DS3 to the harsh pop shift of the Polo, it’s a real treat to listen to the vehicles in action.This year’s game has also taken a huge step up graphically. Even though it is still not even close to the level that which was set by Codemasters DiRT games, it is still a hefty step up from last year’s visuals. The damage model however is still lacking and the water effects are still pathetic but other than that the game looks great.The problem with the game is: it clearly is not ready to be sold. The game is littered with broken content; the main one of which is multiplayer. To enter multiplayer you first must register for their online service. This pointless step forces people to register their username and emails before entering. This also complicates things as they do not tell you this in any shape or form upon attempting to get online. Instead upon entering multiplayer they will notify you that your “nickname” is incorrect. It wasn’t until I used help forums that I realized I had to register prior to entering online. You would think that once registered that would be that, but it gets better: once I registered I was able to play online for only 3 days at which point again they told me my nickname was incorrect. I am not interested in re-authenticating my email 2 times a week for their stupid system. What little time I was in online events I would frequently encounter game crashes and disconnections. What little I played online told me that the online structure is a very basic model. With up to 16 playera and offering only ghost vs game play it is not worth the pain of entry. Online simply doesn’t work; sufficed to say, I have given up on it. These issues continue in other modes however. My final straw was when the game erased my career for seemingly no reason.Now I did start this by stating the series is NOT a good contender for the yearly model which might seem odd as most I have said so far was positive apart from some broken content. The game is a step up for the most part and the game (when it runs) is really fun and tight, but you don’t buy an apple for a few bites and that’s what this game is: a few bites and nothing more. A game that struggles this much to bring working content and not requiring constant recycled content should not need to release a game on a yearly basis.I would recommend this game ONLY if it is not listed for full price. What the game offers is amazing, but losing my career and not being able to play online is enough for me to not recommend it to people who want the complete experience. A series like this needs to take a year off and rethink its strategy.I give this game a 6/10. It is really fun and the game play is really enjoyable but with only half the content working it’s hard to recommend it to everyone."

I guess its biggest competitor is DiRT 3, so let's get to it.WRC 4 is exactly what you'd expect it to be: a game that closely and faithfully follows the workings of the World Rally Championship 2013 season. The tracks are diverse and aplenty and the cars and teams are all in the WRC. They're limited to the 2013 season, which is kind of a bummer, but unlike DiRT 3, you getallof the 2013 cars with all of the liveries, as opposed to just a couple cars per class with a couple more that you have to pay for.Now you might be thinking, ""this all seems very serious, does this mean the cars are super-realistic and hard to control?"" And that's just the thing: the driving physics are realistic buteasyto control, and you can change around the options to make it even easier. Due to being designed for the console market, it's been made very accessible to be played by everyone; it's like theForzaof rally games. Whereas DiRT 1 - the most realistic modern rally game I've played - is a total buzzkill with its constant grip and lack of a sense of speed, WRC 4 makes it feel like you're going really fast and barely in control, and at any point it can throw in a chicane and hairpin out of nowhere to make you spin even a front-wheel-drive car.And that's not even the best part. The best part is that this game makes you try hard not to crash. In DiRT 3, it doesn't really matter if you crash, because it takes a lot to do any mechanical damage and the weekends are so short that it'll be auto-repaired before long anyway. The first time you skid into a wall in WRC 4, on the other hand, you'll swear to yourself not to let it happen again. Crashing has more consequences in this, and you'll find yourself repairing even the most minor damage in the service park at the end of each day, and--...Okay, I'm gushing, so I should wrap this up.

Because it is the only modern WRC game available.There is a TON that could be improved in the game, but it is a decent rally game. By far the worst thing is the wheel issues. I have gotten my DF GT working OK, but there are major issues.I have to disagree with people who don't think the handling is realistic. It is actually a very good balance between realsim and arcade handling. The different road surfaces are very noticeable giving each rally it's unique challenges.So if you love the WRC then you probably already own this game. It is only worth about 20$ because it isn't a super polished AAA title, while it is also not a 5$ bin budget title."

It is not perfect but as a genre that is SERIOUSLY lacking in representation it is the best there is out there.  I agree that the six stages in each rally are the same whatever class you are in, and hopefully in future editions this will be improved.  I couldn't care less about everyone else's beef about the poor quality spectator animations, you only see them for a few seconds at the beginning of each stage.  The rallying itself is very well done and very exciting and as you move up the classes the cars get more powerful and also more challenging and to me that is the key ingredient in a game like this.If more people support it and stop whining about spectator animations as opposed to seeing the game as a whole then Milestone will hopefully continue to support and improve the game in future editions.  I have already heard that this version is a huge step up from the previous two.  Sure the graphics in the DIRT series are snappier but how often now do you get to rally in the DIRT series and talk about repetition in the few rallies that are offered overlaid with peurile dudespeak.If you love rallying this is definitely a serious bang for your buck and I am sure it will only get better in the future.

For first time from ages (and I mean ages, Mobil 1 Rally Championship I think was last rally game with some part of license) we got official FIA licence which helps build rally mood, we got original WRC drivers in original cars battling on four WRC orignal levels. There is something like career mode which will guide you trough all four levels of World Rally Championship from Junior WRC to the top. Locations are official WRC sites but Milestone didn't recreate stages but simply make some variation about it keeping national character. Stages are disappointingly short, max 6km on one stage and 6 stages on one rally which gives us merely 25-30km of rallying on each locations. But stages are packed with action, so we still got fun twitching fingers on endless hairpins. To be not mistaken - this is not a simulator, stages are too short and setups too basic, but game itself could pretend to title of semi-simulator in which nicely done arcade parts like steering, setups or maps got added a pinch of simulation in physics and handling. There are some bugs, mostly in collssion detection and in handling but cautious driver could ride trough whole rally didn't noticing any part of it. Graphics are moderate, cars looks good, some stages also looks nice but some stages looks like unfinished (maybe they will finish it in console game Sebastian Loeb Rally Evo).Concluding - really nice rally rcade game with pinch of simulation reminding last rally oriented CMR game - Colin McRae 2005 (in first Dirt on 56 events only 18 were rally oriented with next 6 hill climbs)."

The cars slide, drive and behave just like you'd expect them to and connecting 2 or 3 perfect hairpins puts a HUGE smile on my face.The graphics are also better, especially the lighting. The flat trees still suck.NO -THEY TOOK OUT ALL THE CLASSIC CARS!!!  WTF??Is it even a rally game without an HF Integrale? without Audi S1? Without a ford Escort?The sound is horrible.You can barely make a difference between the cars. They all sound the same.You can't hear the shocks compressing when you jump like a madman in Finland.Nickie is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off asking ""Are you ok??"" everytime I touch or graze a poll...Just do your freaking job and call out the turns, I can take care of myself.There's almost no flicking gravel sound in the underbody.Surfaces -There are the usual gravel, tarmac and snow; and the modifiers - loose, wet, dry.There's no IceThere's no mudThere's no compact snowThere's no wet gravelThere's no ""bumpy"" gravelThere's no wet tarmac (there's icy tarmac).There are no potholes or small rocks (if you drove Greece on CMR2005 you know what I mean).The jumps in Finland are un-inspiring.No true - Head to Head - special stages like CMR2005.Conclusion -I bought this game for $2.99 on Steam Sale. It was worth it up to a point - when I discovered that there are no classic beasts. when I did, I played a little more in the WRC level (using the Citroen) and then quit. I was bored and it was pointless.It's hard to find a game that has the same control feel as CMR2005 that puts a smile on your face in the hairpins. This game does,  but it falls short in all other aspects (excluding graphics, obviously).Worth it, maybe, under 5 bucks. maybe."

It's not simulation you will expect from Richard Burns Rally or DiRT: Rally, but this game can be very enjoyable if you're just willing to play a rally game.I will admit this though, Milestone isn't my favorite game developer when it comes to WRC but that being said I still like what they do though it isn't up to that level of simulation though this game was not approached to simulation but more of that casual feel to it. Would I recommend it though? Hard to say. I like their WRC games I wouldn't say I love them though, they're just simply a good game. No more no less. So the decision is really up to you."

The game keeps crashing and dropping FPS, but I disabled online features and the game stop doing all of that. So if you're buying this, DO NOT ACTIVATE ONLINE FEATURES at game settings. Everytime you finish a track (can it be called track? I think not) it will pop a message saying it could not syncronize the time you made, but it's ok as I said before, no one plays this game anymore.Back at the WRC 2, you could change tire settings, here you can't. WRC 3 was more focused at completing stunts and all. Here on WRC 4 is like playing WRC 1 again. all you have to do is win championships.How can they not have female voices for co-drivers? :/ even if you play with a team that the co-driver is female, the voice is a male's voice. That was very indelicate from developers... u.uThe sound effects here is nice!I think WRC 3 was more fun from all the special events like driving old cars and all."
