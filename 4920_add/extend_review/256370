,Recommended,256370,9653069,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,ShmoeHAMMAD,"Great game.  It offers a great sense of realism and really challenges your abilities while still being great for any beginner.  Not that I need to mention it, but the graphics are quite amazing as well.  Sounds are okay.  They aren't the best in the world, but they will do.  The career mode is fairly in depth and you can tweak just about every setting on your bike which is very nice.The only issue I am experiencing right now is the sound cutting off about 30 minutes in causing me to restart the game (onboard Realtek 7.1).  I experienced the same bug in the demo.  I still definitely recommend the game for any enthusiastic racer.UPDATE1:  There is one thing that absolutely BUGS me about this game and it totally kills the realism for me.  Devs, if you are reading this, please for the love of God FIX THE START GATE!  This whole ""ready, steady, start"" crap is so annoying.  You guys just need to make it where you get the 30 second warning board turned sideways and just drop the gate randomly (2-10 seconds) and if you go too soon you get stuck at the gate.  This is not a game killer for me, but for a game that is striving for realism, I can't believe you guys could mess this up.Also, a possible workaround for the sound bug for me seems to be changing the ""voices number"" to 32 instead of 64.  So far it is working, I'll update this review if I discover that it didn't fix it.UPDATE2:  Changing the ""voices number"" did not fix the problem."

Sliding it into a tight turn and powering out feels better than any other mx game out there.Throttle control. Again, using throttle control to kick the back end out is wonderful.First person actually looks & feels good.Actually needing to brake.The game looks nice...just about. Bike models look amazing, well done.Pretty in depth career mode, & 1st one for a long time.Customisation of the bike settings before a race is great.Practice/Qualifying formats.And finally well done Milestone for a simultaneous PC release!CON'sPhysics in the air feel awful & clunky.Ready Steady Go start format? Is this Mario Kart? Should just drop the gate & the clutch...(see next point).Theres no clutch!!??? Massive negative here.....Why can't I control the whip/scrub? Don't animate such an important feature!! Doesn't feel fluid or natural.Track deformation doesn't make a difference to handling.Ruts and berms don't feel supportive & I feel like cross rutting isn't an issue, even late in a race.Spin outs and wheelies can feel random at times.No rev sound on the start gate & in the air?? Get that stuff recorded and implement it!! Basic stuff there...Rear brake & panic rev doesn't do much in the air.Why make 250F's unable to clear most jumps? They're pretty much as fast as a 450F irl, sometimes out qualifying them.Summary.To be fair, on the ground at least MXGP feels great. Cornering is good, feedback feels great, the rider positioning and animations are spot on and you can make this engine look good once you have got it down. But the clunky whip/scrub feature and the lack of rev sounds brings you literally crashing back down to earth with a bang.The career mode is deep and rewarding, although I get the impression a few things could have been pushed a little more. I guess not being able to choose which clothing brand I wear is due to clothing being tied to some teams & manufacturers with it being official sponsors and all. But it just feels like some design choices could have been implemented a little better.I love mx games, and will buy them regardless to support the industry. We need developers to keep making these games so it pushes them further. If Milestone release an MXGP 2, or MXGP 2015 or whatever its called, I think it will be great, but this one just falls short of a great title.5.5/10 imho."
,Recommended,256370,9655694,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,Motoagogo,"Coming from an ex amateur Motocross racer and a huge fan of all moto games alike, I have to say this is the game I have been waiting for. It can be a mild arcade racer for those of you that just want a fun moto game, while the vets and fans of real riding will love the Sim aspect of the game once you put the difficulty and assists to realistic. The game is pretty much MX Sim with better graphics than alive and the dual stick controls we love from reflex. The career is very realistic and has timed practice as well as qualifying with every race on the career, then like real Motocross you will do a moto 1 and moto 2 to see who gets the points for the weekend. The AI will keep you on the edge until the checkered flag, you never know when someone is going to scrub past you or show a wheel in a turn. Real racers, real tracks, real sponsors, real everything. Best moto game in years and a must buy to any fan of the sport.  9/10"
,Not Recommended,256370,13190690,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,*R§F*TheCapulet,"Preface: I come from a deep motocross backgroundAfter playing this game for a few days, I can, without a doubt, say that this game is the most realistic motocross game out right now.  Unfortunately the bar isn't set very high, considering the only competition to this game is previous titles from the same developer.Despite how realistic everyone says the rider physics are, how authentic everyone says the track and bike physics are, and despite the fact that they (the devs) call this game a ""simulator"" in the opening credits, the idea that this game represents a realistic take on motocross is laughable at it's very best.Every single AI rider will attempt to scrub seemingly every small bump they ride up to, no matter how much time they lose wobbling off a small jump that didn't require them to scrub any speed at all.  If you hit a rider, expect him to stay upright while you go flying.  If another rider hits you, expect him to stay upright while you go flying.  If you hit the yellow dirt, rather than the brown dirt, expect to get thrown off your bike.  How depends on the angle you approach the white dirt at speed.  But as soon as you hit it, you either start floating while flailing your arms while your bike sinks into the ground, or you literally fall right through the bike and start ragdolling all over the place.  It's just infuriatingly stupid.The very last race I ran, a rider came down on top of my bike and literally rode a third of a lap on top of my helmet.  When he finally dismounted... I crashed.  He didn't.  I mean, FFS?Also, ""career mode"" is nothing more than a continuous championship mode with the choice of bike livery between seasons.  There's no depth or fun.  You don't feel like you're building or contributing to anything.  You just simply race, go back to the silly appartment, rinse and repeat.  Oh, but you can pick your helmet (I'm rolling my eyes).Want to know what pisses me off even more?  The fact that they force you to use mouse and keyboard in menus unless you want to guess which buttons do what.  For a game that is a true to life ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port, you'd think they'd at least have some decent controller setup and support.And multiplayer... ♥♥♥♥ing multiplayer.  I can't comment on it because it just plain doesn't work.  I've created an account, I've activated it via email, and even visted their website using it.  But any time I click on multiplayer, it tells me I need an activated account to play.The one redeaming quality this game has is that it's track deformation isn't matched in any game, any genre, anywhere.  (And... I take this back.  SpinTires puts it to absolute shame.  VBS2.5 also does better, though I couldn't call it a game.)  There are more fun racing games.  There are more fun motocross games, for that matter.  There are certainly more realistic racing games, even with bikes, despite the unfortunate fact that there are no MX game competitors.Do I reccomend this game?  Only if you REALLY REALLY REALLY need to ride a dirt bike in a game.  Otherwise, spend your money on something less half-baked.PS: the graphics don't look nearly as good as the screenies.  The graphics suck.  Expect terrain LOD popping at all times as well."

MXGP is not a game where you pull off insane tricks or jump off giant cliffs. MXGP is a recreation of real MX racing and it does this fairly well.Pros:+ There are multiple game types - Instant race, Grand Prix, Championship season, Career Mode and Time attack. It has  recreated tracks from real tracks on the MX tour. The tracks also have track deformation of the dirt and mud. There seams to be a lot of tracks as well. I'm not real far into it but the season I'm in has at least a dozen to complete.+ Multiple difficulties that can be tweaked to make MXGP as easy/arcade or Hard/Simulation as you prefer.+ The physics and handling of the motorcycles are done very well. No other MX game has gotten this close to the feeling of riding a real MX bike. (yes I have ridden on real MX bikes and street bikes as well)+The replays look good and have multiple options like slow motion, pause and a free cam. You can get some nice screenshots.+ Graphics are solid. The riders and the bikes look good and gather dirt and mud on them during the race. The tracks are pretty good too but could have been done better. I use SweetFX on this game and it makes it look better.+You can remap the controls on the controller. I recommend you use a controller. I don't know of any racing game that work well with mouse and keyboard. At least not for me. I recommend that you change the lean forward and backwards to the same stick as steering left and right. It feels much more natural this way.+You level up, unlock pictures, gear, bikes ect and you get more fans the better you do in each race. Also there is a simulated email and twitter type media in the game that makes tyou feel you are being watched by teams, fans and your manager. It's a nice touch to give a sense of progression and connection in the game.Cons:- The presentation is pretty bad. In between races I've had my bike disappear in the pits. The pit crew guy is working on an imaginary, invisible bike. Also before a race, during the intro scene, my rider was shaking around like he was have convultions. The pit crew and girl who holds the starting card all look and act like zombies. Why even put these in the game ?  Also, Some of the ground during races has pop in and loads textures too. The game needs a patch to fix these things.- The sound is not very good either. The bikes just sound weak, why can't developers get this right ? Even if it's not realistic they need to alter the engine sounds to make them more rich and intense. Also, There is no option to play music during races, it would be nice to have. I noticed there is barely any sounds of the stadium surroundings happening. It would be great to have the crowd react to what is happening. Cheer when you overtake or respond to a big wreck. Make the game and the race feel exciting Milestone ! Enough with the barebones, boring presentation already !Also a track announcer being heard over the PA system would add some immersion. Having your pit crew tell you your doing great or you have 1 lap to go would really add some interaction to the game. These things could have be easily added into the game and would make the game better. On my PC the sound cuts in and out during start videos but no real problem in game so far. I've seen that many people have had problems in game though. Patch these things into the game Milestone.Overall the game just feels kind of bland. This happed in other games by Milestone. I loved the racing and handling in MotoGP 08 but it has the same barebones presentaion and sound as well. Milestone get the racing right, and that is what is most important, but they need to add some flavor and style into these games. As for now I will enjoy MXGP for what it is but there is definately room for improvement."
,Recommended,256370,15975708,"Posted: 23 May, 2015",all,Southern808,"Wow...I'm impressed.  I raced motocross and did my fair share of freestyle and enduro for close to 12 years so I know a thing or 2 about motocross.  That being said it's been a good decade since my glory days with my 2003 CR250R and video games is about as close as I can get to my favorite past time without winning the lottery so finding this game was a real treat, and very nice alternative to the super fun, but dated mx reflex.   Anyway, the game handles and looks great IMO, im not a fan of the GP circuit but since this is the most authentic motocross game I'll take what I can get, and while I don't think a freestyle(tricks) mode is needed in a sim racer like this, i do wish it had a free ride mode(big jumps and whips).  Like say a big open playground in Glamis Sand Dunes.  That would have been the icing on the cake.  They decided to go the racing only route and thats cool and all because they really focused on that one thing and really spit shined it.  After playing this game im really hoping for a next gen sequel with a bit more content like free ride, enduro, and freestyle because I have really come to like the more weighted feel of the bike handling.  Maybe im looking through rose shaded glasses but it really does feel quite authentic when it comes to the handling.  I highly recommend this to any actual motocross racers/riders and/or fans in the room.  Thumbs up!"
,Recommended,256370,9669426,"Posted: 29 March, 2014",all,Gunny,"While more of a simcade than anything, MXGP is a must own for any MX fans out there. While far from perfect, MXGP tries to aim for a slightly more realistic approach to MX racing via realistic cornering and braking physics, but falls short with poor jumping physics and poor bike sounds. A CONTROLLER IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Pros:+ 14 Real world tracks to choose from+ Realistic cornering and braking+ Authentic racing experience (Real tracks, bikes, teams and riders)+ Good graphics+ Bike tuning (though somewhat limited in terms of options) actually affects the way bikes behave+ Decent AI (15 AI riders supported in offline play)+ Intense multiplayer races see players banging bars as they fight for the perfect lines (12 players supported)+ Mo-capped rider animations look awesome+ Realistic helmet cam view (if that's your kind of thing)Cons:- Horrible bike sounds (what is this, Excitebike?)- Poor jumping physics (lack of mid-air control/no gas gyro effects)- Scrubbing seems rather mechanical and automated (players are only required to push both sticks in the same direction near the lip/takeoff of a jump which requires no real skill and uses the same animation over and over)- Track deformation is mostly cosmetic (players cannot physically ride in ruts formed on the track)[*edit* after 5+ laps, corners are harder to take due to braking ruts/bumps forming, however bikes ride 'on top' of the dirt as opposed to 'in it' thus resulting in mounds forming in corners as opposed to ruts which players can ride in for better traction.]- Relatively steep price (although not gameplay related)Still highly recommend picking this game up as it breathes fresh air into the MX racing genre, providing countless hours of fun on tracks which are easy to learn but hard to master (and pays off if you do). The game has good AI for those who wish to play offline, but online play is where this game truly shines. Despite the games efforts of providing an authentic MXGP experience, a track editor would have been a nice touch.TL;DRGreat MX game which is a step in the right direction, with room for improvement. If/when improved, could easily be one of the best MX racing games out there.  8/10"
,Recommended,256370,10077784,"Posted: 10 May, 2014",all,Gabe,"Before I totally thrash this game, let me say that it is THE BEST motocross game ever released. The developers are definitely on the right track with this game. This is the most realistic motocross game ever.However..1. This is a very, very barebones game. Once you have mastered it and can win on highest difficult on all of the tracks it is boring. All you will be doing is the same races over and over again. Online can add some better competition, but it hardly ever works. When it does work it is totally laggy, and I don't even mean the other players are lagging around. It is YOUR bike that is jerking around. What the hell is up with that?!?!? Just no. That's horrible.- Make an actually fun career mode to fix this. Take hints from other racing games... I really like how in career on F1 2012 you can complete challenges to ""collect data for research"" and if you can complete the challenges correctly you can gain a performance improvement that stays for the rest of the career. That is really cool and keeps you playing the career mode, because it is not the same thing over and over again. Add that to this game!!- Make online multiplayer actually work, thanks.2. WHERE ARE THE TWO STROKES? This ain't motocross without two strokes. It even says the displacement limits for the two strokes before you select which class to race. So where are they?- Add two-strokes, people love them3. The sound is HORRIBLE in this game. Seriously what am I riding, a bicycle with a spoke slapper or a high tech racing engineered single? Because in this game it really sounds like a bicycle with a spoke slapper. The sound of the bikes is SO stupid. Jeez it's ridiculous- I don't know how the developers managed to screw this up, but unscrew it!4. The rear end is firmly planted. There is way too much rear end traction. We are riding on the dirt here. In real life the rear end is soooo light and easy to break loose. You can't steer with the rear much in this game because that rear tire won't break loose! Even jabbing fully on the rear brake doesn't cause the tire to lock!- Decrease the traction in the rear!5. The 250's don't have enough power. Seriously, you're telling me I can't power out of a corner in second gear on a 250? That's just wrong. Also the 250's rev WAY too slowly. In real life when you blip the throttle it will go from idle to rev limit before your brain can even process what just happened. On this game it takes a whole 1.5 seconds to rev to the limiter in neutral or in the air. That's wrong.- Engines need to rev up more quickly6. Downshifting and engine braking slow the bike down like magic. Again the rear end is demonstrating way too much traction. If you come hauling♥♥♥♥♥at 50mph into a turn on this game, all you need to do is slam it down to first gear and you immediately slow down to the max speed of first gear. That is so stupid.- Decrease the rear end traction!!!7. The power on all of the bikes is far too easy to control. You can slam it wide open on a 450 coming out of a corner in second gear on this game and everything will be just fine. Really? Because I'm pretty sure that will totally break your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ open in real life as all the♥♥♥♥♥♥comes blasting out of it.- Power needs to be more violent8. The whips/scrubs are programmed. You don't get to do them yourself, they just happen if you lean off of a jump. That was really disappointing. The worst part is the impending front flip after you do a whip. You can't throttle out of it after you whip, your♥♥♥♥♥is just going over the bars!- At the very least, fix the front flip problem. You should be able to hit the throttle to get the front end up mid air9. The power on the 450s peaks too early. You make it half way through the rev range and then the power drops off and stops picking up. That's wrong. Yes, 450s have assloads of power at low RPM but they still do peak way up there.10. No clutch option to slip the clutch. Being able to slip the clutch is important, especially on 250s when you need to get to the meat of the power at the apex of a turn. You can't do that in this game, which is a big problem.11. The ruts don't really change the way you ride the track. That's totally unrealistic. Ruts are a game changer.- Make the ruts able to dig down deeper into the track.12. Helmet camera is horrible on this.- increase the field of view both vertically and horizontally13. I'd like more setup options. Gear ratio options: you get to choose between low, medium or high. Woooooooooooooooo that's just epic isn't it? NOT -.-14. Let's have some weather! Motocross doesn't magically make the weather 75F and sunny. Change it up a bit!15. There just isn't much of an exciting atmosphere to the game. It's pretty drab :/16. Add some more excitement with camera effects and other special effects. A tiny bit of motion blur and camera shake would be nice. Update the graphics so they don't look so old and plain! Again take hints from other racing games. The Shift 2 / Project CARS game engine is a perfect example of how camera and graphics effects can really make the game!"

Looking at standings or emails for team offers; it's even got it's own fake social media to get trash talked by rivals and praise from fans.There is always a quite a learning curve I feel in MotoBike games to overcome due to the added mechanic of needing to control the lean and balance of the rider atop the bike for peak efficiency. The game has some varied options of assists to aid in learning this; From making it mostly autonomous to complete manual control of the riders lean. There is also a nice balance of gear head tinkering. Balanced in the way that even someone with a limited grasp of the way an engine works can still fine tune the bike to their desired performance. It isn't as robust as say shopping for parts and getting into the nitty gritty but it has some simplified values that for example, can change the bike height on each wheel base as well as spring stiffness, coil dampening to affect responsiveness/stability and the gear ratio to effectively change the preference to favor acceleration or top speed. Each setting is affixed with a short and concise blurb as to what increasing or decreasing each setting would affect.Some technical snafu'sThere are some minor graphical issues regarding the menus showing up from time to time but are not really that troublesome as they can be navigated still and with relative ease.The game's V-sync is locked at 30fps regardless of the setting you choose and your refresh rate.

So I will say no because I dont have a single friend who is into motocross who likes this game enough to buy it.Now that instantly makes it sound like this game isnt worth your time, but it really depends on who you are. I personally ride in real life, as well as film and help out in the pits for friends when they are racing. This sport is a large part of my life and has been since I was very young.I also grew up playing the mx vs atv series, a series which was recently resurrected. The best motocross game I have ever played is still ""MX vs ATV: Reflex"". Unfortunately the MX vs ATV series has reduced in quality and became far too ""arcady"" since then.Now, on to this game. I will start with the pros and cons.PROS:-HUGE improvement over MUD (the previous MX game released by these devs)-Official licensed riders, gear, brands, sponsors and tracks-Decent gameplay (more on this later)-Decent amount of content-Decent Graphics-Career mode is pretty coolCons-Milestone will barely support their games after release. This game doesn't have glaring technical issues but if it did they would be unlikely to patch it.-The gameplay is BARELY Decent-Is by no means a Simulator-Whip/Scrub physics. We told the devs exactly what needed to be done with the whips and scrubs (make them similar to mx vs atv reflex with slightly more realism) but instead it is just the same locked animation over and over and over.-They may not be changing much for the sequel (from what I have seen so far)-Audio is S***.   Seriously I had to mute the engine noise it is that bad, sounds nothing like a dirt bike. the saddest part is it is recorded from an actual bike. So i have no idea if it is their equipment, compression or editing that absolutely destroys it.-Bikes. the power curve is no where near realistic. I should feel like im riding a bull not a slugThe game is alright, a bit of fun when played in moderation. People need to know that this is not a simulator, even though it is commonly reffered to as one. It is only slightly above being very arcady. A big issue with the tracks and physics are jumps and berms. the jumping physics are very floaty and the jump sizes do not appear to be realistically sized compared to their real world counterparts. Then there are berms. in the real world berms are great for catching your speed and helping you maintain it around a corner. If you hit a berm too fast in real life you will likely ""blow it out"" meaning the front end pushes through the dirt ruining the line and likely making you crash. in this game you cant hit 90% of berms (the tops of berms specifically) without them blowing out, at any speed, which completley ruins the point of even putting them on the track. In other words, some parts of the track dont have collisions.Then there are controls. It is great that they copied mx vs atv and added dual stick controls. one stick for the rider weight and one for the bike steering. This is one of the biggest improvements over ""MUD"". In-air controls are horrible. Hit a jump leaning back and go front end high? Too bad even leaning all the way foward and hitting the back brake as hard as you possibly can (as you would do in a worst case senario in real life) wont save you. There is no engine gyro effect, throttle and brake have little or no effect in the air which is very dissapointing. Cornering is Good but not great, track degradation doesnt effect you very much.Dont even think about playing this game without a controller, that makes it multiple times worse.I could elaborate more on the cons of this game but I wont. If a casual arcade game without a lot of challenge (after you get used to the basic controls) is what you are after go ahead.Die hard motocross fans who want a simulator are still stuck with the dated, but still the closest thing to a full on simulator we have, ""MX simulator"" it isnt on steam and certainly isnt for everyone but if you have the same complaints as me it may be what you are after.I look foward to seeing if they respond to fans and make improvements in the sequel, due out early 2016.(I personally have my doubts as the devs seem to think the main playerbase is children, reffering to us as ""crazy crossers"" on facebook... Cringe worthy)Prove me wrong Milestone!"

The graphics are fine if you don't pay any attention to the the generic looking ""race fans"" and other scenery.  The controls(xbox controller) and physics are great,  and it's fun to play right from the start.The listed minimum requirements are pretty low, and I wonder if they would even push 30 FPS.  I'm guessing the minimum should be more like ""Core 2 Duo 3Ghz/GTX260 or equivalent"".  At 1080p the recommended specs probably get about 60-100 FPS, and more current hardware gets 100-200 FPS."

You can play as the official riders and race on the real world motocross tracks. Also, you get bikes like KTM, Suzuki, Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Tm (I don't remember the last manufacturer). In Career mode, you start as a wildcard rider and if you are good enough, you'll move up to the MX1 class. The riding physics are good, and it is somewhat newbie-friendly. It will take a while to get used to the handling of the bike, and the AI (on easy they can be a challenge if you are new to the game).One drawback is you can't turn off the controller vibration. This is pretty annoying, especially for someone who doesn't like to play with vibration (like me). The multiplayer? There's almost no one playing there, but it doesn't bother me.If you are planning to get this game, I suggest that you get a controller first. You'll have a hard time playing using the keyboard. If you like racing or sports games, I would recommend this game. It's a pretty fun game overall."

Although the graphics to the track are kind of weird and abnormal but still look fine. The handling is a bit strange at first but once you put in a few races it should be fine. The game limits you on tracks and also customization. The teams and venues are a nice addition to the scene of MX games. Overall I'd give it a 7/10. And if you are on the fence about it and already own Mx vs ATV Reflex go ahead and stick with that."

But then slowly realize that this game is just not that exciting. Graphics are good, but it's 2014, everything in the game realm looks good. The cornering / braking physics are great, but thats about the end of it. Jumping is terrible, and is truly a giant eye sore every lap, which zaps the fun right out of it. Bike sounds are not even close. No Clutch, starts are just hold the throttle, power/speed/airtime ratio is like the old mars environment on Supercross 2000 for PS. Also, this is completely obvious, but it's called MXGP for a reason. These tracks are total euro style, really rough, and small awkward jumps, which for some reason they thought would be cool, and maybe to some it is. But for me, it's like watching it on TV, and it gets boring.  Keep waiting, and save your money. Play Reflex / Alive to hold you over."

You should be able to add a team mate to really controll and manige your race team. Also next game add supercross and nationals. this give almost infinet gameplay and something to work for.

76561197983225082,Recommended,256370,17152950,"Posted: 21 July, 2015",all,baddog993,This game can be fun. It has a few different race options so you can do an instant race or a career mode. The game also has a multiplayer online that I have not tried out. The graphics look sort of dated. They do not look bad. However they do not have the wow factor either. That being said the tracks you race on are varied and a good mix. Some of the tracks have a lot of elevation and some are more flat with little hills scattered around the track. I also think the intro to each track is very well done. Live action video intermixed with game footage. It looks cool.I have the game on easy and on easy as you would expect its super easy to come in first in every race. I find that to be a good thing because the handeling is a bit of mystery to me still. You control the bike with left stick and the rider with the right stick. In theory this should make it more interesting in practice I found it to be a mixed bag. My issue with the handeling of the bike is that the rider will sometimes fall for no reason at all. It can be annoying. A turn you think you can make if you lean to the right can cause you to wipe out. So if you do not lean at all you can easily take the corner perhaps because sometimes he will go nuts and crash for no reason. That is very annoying and really hurts the gameplay. It would help if they would have added a meter to let you know what caused the crash and how to avoid crashing in the turns. Something like what Forza and Grid 2 has.  A meter to let the player know if he is leaning to far left or right. It feels like a lot like luck when you can manage a turn.My other nit pick besides the weird falling down is other riders hitting you and making you crash. Now this looks cool because it can also happen to other computer motorcycles. So that is cool. However the AI racers can be really agressive and can knock you off your bike while they get off scott free. Thats annoying. You can do it to other racers but again its mostly just luck if you pull it out.My other nit pick is the sound. The game cut me off from sound into my next race and this appears to be a common complaint that just never got fixed. I have my audio settings for stero only. Also the game crashed on me one time however after having played a few more races it has yet to repeat this issue. The sound when it works is very good.I feel like I should mention one more thing. The tracks have very little life to them. While the tracks look good and are varied their is not a lot that moves on them in the background. I wish the game had more background stuff that moved more. For an example in one race map their is a wind turbine and it looks good but it never moves. So its a mixed bag. If I was rating it I would give it a 7/10. The other thing is the price for $20 dollars I would never buy this as its to expensive for what you get. For the price of $5 to $10 dollars its a lot better looking at this price. I paid 5.Also this is not an arcade game but more of a lite simulator. You cannot go full bore thru the corners as you will crash out. So you do have to watch the throttle also you can customize your bike for suspension and gear ratios.

It can appeal to those who really race and appreciate the physics of the realistic mode more, or those who just like to play a fun racing game. If you are wondering how this compares to other off road racing games, particularly MX vs ATV, this is how:-MXGP has really good physics and is less arcady than MX vs ATV (especially when you are on the realistic mode)-MXGP gives you option to set up your bike however you choose. This will probably appeal to those who really race or know a thing or two about it.-MXGP has a more realistic career mode, letting you choose a team to sign with and wearing your endorsments on your jersey and bike.-MXGP features all real brands, people, and tracks, unlike MX vs ATV (MX vs ATV only has KTM available as a real brand for dirt bikes)Those are just a few of the ways MXGP beats MX vs ATV. As far as the graphics and sound go, I'd say both games are pretty good there. MXGP does have nice graphics, but the animation at the end of the race when you win is just... unnatural.MX vs ATV give you more things to do, being a game that doesn't only focus on dirt bikes (even though that was probably their main focus).MX vs ATV lets you drive a bunch of other different vehicles like an ATV, trophy truck, and more. MX vs ATV also features more types of racing. It features supercross, motocross, enduro, and has free ride available.Things I wish were included in this game:-Free ride-Enduro-Hard Enduro-Multiplayer for each of those thingsOverall, MXGP is a great game for motocross enthusiasts and your average gamer alike. As for which of the two games mentioned are better, that depends entirely on you and the features/style of offroad racing game you want. MX vs ATV supercross is planned and hopefully supercross isnt the only style of racing they include because that is one thing that I do love about Reflex (the amount of racing styles available).Another thing is that MX vs ATV might beat MXGP with the real time ground deformation, but both games do it well."

I am able to feel like I did when I was in my prime because of the outstanding work done by your team.All anyone needs to do is try the demo or the game to see that this program is beyond anything except my imagination.I started with pong in the seventies and have played every racing simulator from then till now and never have I seen an understanding of what it feels like and looks like until now.I highly reccomend this game to anyone who loves racing.
76561198138308653,Recommended,256370,10335999,"Posted: 3 June, 2014",all,Gandorlf,"Hardcore MX fans will love this. Controls felt strange compared to Reflex but once you've given them 30 minutes, you're laughing. Would recommend to any MX fan!**EDIT**Having played this a lot more now, I'm going to write a half decent review.Firstly, I will go onto the base game. As you can see the game is officially licensed, and as such contains most if not all riders, teams, and tracks of the Motocross Grand Prix. Bike sounds (MX2 and MX1) and physics have been faithfully re-created (I'm playing with 'pro' physics enabled) as have the decals and gear etc. The game plays very well, and any fan of the late MX vs ATV games will feel right at home with this having had to deal with the goon riding of 'Alive' (Although Reflex was outstanding imo).The career mode is basic yet very enjoyable. You begin your career as a wild card rider in MX2 for one of the lesser known teams, and compete in various GP's all over the world on the very well re-created tracks. By earning points and beating rival riders, you become more established and begin to attract fans and offers from various teams. Your team will set you goals of how many points you need to achieve, although failing to do so repeatedly apparently sees you losing your contract with that team (I've not had this yet). Bigger and better teams such as KTM/RedBull, Honda, Suzuki/Rockstar etc have more demanding goals than the smaller teams, and require you do maintain at least a top 3 position throughout the season. Doing well enough you can either transistion up to MX1 (Where the bikes are considerable more powerful and harder to handle) or choose to stay at MX2... The choice is all yours.In terms of gameplay it plays very well. I'm currently running at max graphics and audio setting playing with a Windows Xbox 360 controller, and the game recognised it immedietly (no controller mapping required) so I can't comment on what a keyboard plays like. Rider animations are extremely diverse/dynamic and feel very life-like so it's all good in that department! The graphics are very good, although some people may notice a few crappy textures here and there, but rest assured the level of detail on the rider gear, bikes, tracks etc is more than pleasing. You can scrub too, nuff said.The game did receive a few poor reviews which I think (upon actually playing the game) were very unfair. Most reviewers we're expecting an arcade style racer and based they're reviews upon that assumption. So don't knock this one MX fans, this is I think the most fun MX game I have played in recent years! (I've played most too). And to play on real tracksa with fully licensed bikes and sponsors is a nice treat too.Now on to customisation, which is what most people like these days. You are free to choose the manufacturer of your bike, all the nice toys are there (Yamaha, Honda, KTM, Suzuki, Kawasaki, TMRacing). However, different teams use different bikes, so as offers come your way be sure to check the model of the bike before you decide what team you're going to sign with! (You get multiple chances to change anyway). You can choose from 12 (I think??) set helmets which come with preset goggles, your rider gear is determined by which team you are signed with. As far as boots go, I have no idea. The AI in the game sport boots by Alpinestars, Gearne, Fox etc so I'm not sure why the custom rider is stuck with Sidi boots! As usual you can pick a name and number, as long as that number isn't in use by one of the pro riders in the game. Most players will be pleased however, as there are a lot of teams to choose from all with unique gear so that should satisfy most players.In terms of expansion, I see a lot of possibilities. I see most people asking for 2 Stroke bikes, but any real fan of the MXGP would know that they do not race 2 Stroke bikes in the MXGP, only 4 Stroke. Again, they're going for authenticity here guys. I would like to see more tracks added to the game, be they fictional or from other parts of the world (Glen Helen anyone?), or maybe even a track-editor so people can create and share tracks. Who knows.Anyway, I hope this review helps. I'm overall very pleased with the game as I haven't had a decent MX game to play since I got insanely bored with Reflex (too many hours, lol) so this is a breathe of fresh air. Happy racing dudes!8.5/10"

Nice sim, so few gimmicks like arcade style with metal music and stunts for boosts. Good graphics for a smaller indie co, with the dirt sand or pack and showing tracks on later laps. Lots of sweet tight turns so lots of braking rather than just going full throttle all the time.Can change or remap gamepad keys so u don't have to hold down R1/R2 the entire time (I like A for throttle, X/B front/back brakes) which can make your fingers sore after an hour. Can adjust the bikes some, but no upgrades from what I saw.  A bit annoying is how they reset you if go slightly off the track path, if you make a wide turn it will cost you time so that would be a better way of dealing with it, so wider tracks or allowing to go outside some narrow parameters may be better. Championship/season rally modes can be a bit annoying - like 30 minutes long on the same track can get really boring, unsure if can adjust it. Fun game so far, probably the best in its genre, MX ATV reflex is decent but more arcade style.I rate it a 8/10 and a good price would be under $25, since you can probably get 25 hours out of it."

It's just part of the deal though. Not really a complaint.-Scenery a bit dull for today's graphics, but bikes look great.-Scrubs felt a bit baked, but it's alright.With a few tweaks, making an enduro/Dakar/Romaniacs out of this game would be fantastic (even if it was one race).

Few months later I'm writing this review because I was wrong. This game is a sleeper. The career mode is top notch, you start out in MX2 and have to race your way to the best teams in MX2 and then work your way through MX1. The ground physics are amazing, the air physics need some work, but ground physics make up for the lack of feeling in the air. The AI is pretty good, they are really hard when you let them get infront of you, its a challenege to catch them, but once you are in 1st, you can walk away pretty easy.

Physics are actually suprisingly great and when the AI is set to realistic; it gives you a challenge (unlike some other motocross games). The bikes look great and so do the riders. I also really like the replay feature (although the ability to rewind would be nice).However, the game acts like it's in Beta. There are many crashes and glitches. And the landscape and overall graphics are pretty terrible for a game made in 2014 (other than the bikes and riders as I mentioned before). The bikes also sound like total crap. There are also only 14 tracks, no free roam (which is understandable for MXGP, but there should be more tracks), very restricted customization, lack of various in-game social feed responses, and so forth.Now it may seem like this game is outweighed with con's from my review, but if you are tolerant enough to look past these faults; it's actually a pretty good game. The gameplay is really great and I like the idea of being in different teams and having different sponsors (although you cannot choose your sponsors). I also really appreciate having actual bikes and not having to pay money for DLC that allows me to ride a Honda or a Yamaha.Overall, I think this game is worth it for anyone that rides motocross or dirt bikes in real life (or perhaps just really like motocross games).

The riding mechanics are deep and satisfying, graphics are great, and the AI is perfect in my opinion. This title is from Milestone, a company that creates racing games truly focused on the actual racing. Just like Moto GP 13, this game puts you in a Career that encourages you to learn the track before race day by offering Practice and Qualifying sessions before the actual race. This makes MXGP a highly rewarding racing experience, when racing on the highest difficulty you will need to know your way around the track to earn the medal.

This game has amazing graphics, physics, and sound compared to any other game of its kind. Although the ruts don't really do anything, and the revs die mid air, and there's no real mid air movement, it's easily better than any other MX game. What's disappointing is that the game consists of many different 4 strokes, but not a single 2 stroke. Fair enough that during the 2013 MXGP season there weren't any 2 strokes competing, but you've still got to give people the option to ride one. Maybe during rider customisation there could be a choice to make your own bike, and that's where the 2 stroke could come in, but we don't even have the option for that. The game gives many hours of gameplay, online and offline, and there's many different tracks and bikes to choose from. The game has full controller support (thank god), as it would be impossible to play without one. Overall, I'm pretty impressed. All I want to see is 2 strokes, and some DLC, and it would make the game one of my favourite games to this day.

Don't get me wrong, I play it a lot. But what other dirt bike game am I supposed to play?They tried to copy the MX vs ATV franchise with the physics, but they failed. It is interesting to see that you can crash by leaning to far over in a turn, which is a new aspect others have failed. The bike and rider graphics themselves are very good. However, the track graphics and how the bike reacts to the track is rubbish. Another thing about this game that really does annoy me is the ""whip/scrub"" feature. MX vs ATV succeeded with allowing you to control the movements, while this game didn't. They only alloy you to do there extremely stupid pre programmed whip/scrub. The tracks could have been done better. What I mean is that there are a lot of jumps you must brake for, or go sailing way past the landing for. As well, there are also a few jumps that no matter how I try, you cannot make them even on the 450. My last complaint would be for the AI's too have been faster. I smoke the ""realsitic"" ones.Anyway though, if you wanna spend 20 for this game do it. Sure I complained, but I actually found it fun to try and get used to the awkward physics.

No, these are in game results that quickly grab your eyeballs and attempt to pull'em from your sockets!Unlike most motorcycle racers out there, this one definately requires you to pay close attention to not only your speed while cornering, but the use of rider leaning plus turning the bike. Yes, you better let off that throttle else it's into the hay stacks, crowds, and trees.Very, very different--and not made easy by default! Even with all driving assists enabled, and NPC racers AI set to basic, you will need some patience and determination to succeed at avoiding last place or DNF ranking in every race.With that all said, I love this game.

Over the course of a few race weekends in career mode I moved the difficulty up from Easy all the way to Realistic (max). I'm still playing with semi-auto rider controls because I just don't care that much, but it's fun.There is quite a bit of variety in the tracks, both in their layouts (flat, very hilly, fast or technical, and so on) and in the surface. I came across tracks where I could not get a decent lap time until I changed things in the bike set-up, which speaks well for that. The surface of the track in this can look kind of janky at times (frequently the ruts don't render until they're behind you) and the engine sounds could be a lot better, but I'm really enjoying it and I think it's very much worth buying on sale.Previous MX games I've played were MX vs ATV Alive & Reflex."

The only thing I like about this game is the support for real bike brands and real sponsors. As far as for the physics of the game: pure crap. When turning, the rider will just randomly fall off of the bike, if the bike even turns at all. The acceleration will cut out after being in the air from a jump, so hitting a rythem section on a track is impossible. After performing a whip over a jump, the front end of the bike will face downward and the bike will land entirelly on the front wheel with all of the weight of the bike and the rider leaning forward. That is 100% unrealistic and there is no way to lean back or combine with the throttle to get the bike to straighten out to the correct position."

I bought it, and after 2 hours of gameplay (spoiler alert: there will be a learning curve to fully enjoy the bike control and movement), I loved it. so much fun. I'm onto those arcady racing bike games like this. aside from the awkward weight transfer in the air (probably because I put the riding aids on base), it's a solid 4.7/5 from me. currently playing the career and will put more time in this game for sure!!!!!"

The audio for the engines is bad and there are no two strokes but the gameplay is incredible. When you corner, you can make use of berms  very well, and ruts pretty good. When you jump you can slam the breaks off a ramp and not nose dive, but other then that jumping is quite realistic. You still can move in the air too which makes it easier and unrealistic. The truth is 95% of the population would be useless on a motocross bike and would fly off the back of it after letting off the clutch. The bikes also feel a little under powered and not nearly as wheelie prone as a real motocross bike. The game does hold your hand a little ,even with realistic physics, and people still complain its too hard, lol. And they don't even have to shift.......Make a real simulator like Dirt Rally, instead of dumbing down, smarten up."
