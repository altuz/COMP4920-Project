Graphics for PC suck, jagged edges everywhere. Audio is terrible. You can't slide the rear into corners anymore (backing it in), Random highsides with TCS on full. AI still seem to always go faster than you mid corner and will ram you from behind at any chance. Regret purchasing this and that makes me seriously sad. Thumbs down on this one."

If you can get past that then please feel free to read further.The game is 'good' and probably the best bike racing simulator I've played, and as a biker I buy them all. The physics engine is generally pretty decent, the bikes themselves are faithfully modelled and of course its nice to have the Dorna permissions to include the full roster of teams and rides. But that's it.The game is built on a clearly dated engine that has reached, if not passed its end of life cycle. I'm playing on a fairly competent machine, i7, 16Gb, GTX670, SSD and the game performs poorly with frequent stuttering. Garage scenes are particularly ugly with massive screen tearing and corruption when selecting the bike to confirm which developments to complete. Very poor.Racing is generally good. There's a decent sense of speed and simulation going on though the sound of the bikes is pretty off. AI is generally perfunctory at best. They ride and do what they're supposed to do though have no real character; you can certainly tell that it is algorithm riding the bikes.However the biggest negative is the startling fact that this is a poorly optimised console port and Milestone hasn't done anything to even attempt to hide this fact: No graphics options, poorly optimised UX (for PC), No way to Quit to desktop(!), no way to save custom controller configurations...Milestone don't tend to patch their games. I don't expect any of these issues to be addressed.End of the day I waited until the game was on sale before buying as I'm fully aware of Milestone's track record and history with respect to their games and support there on in. I paid GBP 14.99 and feel that I have a fair value for money at that price proposition.Summary; it is a 'good game' for an unambitious console port with the usual trappings of what that entails. Don't buy at full price!"

The sound is horrible. The backfire on the bikes sound like someone beating on a drum. Really guys, a drum beat for the backfire sound. lol. Crashes also sounds like someone beating on some metal object. Just horrible sounds. Now, for some reason, everytime i start the game up, i have to redo my controller settings. I don't understand why this happens but its not saving my controller settings. Pitiful!!! One other note, two people so far have told me that the game won't even start up. Go figure. Im not surprised at all with this games bugs. I anticapated the bugs in this game as a result of the '13 bugs but to make this game worse, im not getting this. I think the rights to this game should be given to some other gaming company to produce and that could do a better job at this, maybe EA Sports just to name one. This is really pathetic. Also, the only way i can exit the game is to force close with the Task manager and because of that, i lost my progress. Nice. All that work i did lost.  lol. Oh, and  i almost forgot, im missing some of the Moto2/3 bikes due to DLC. I just bought the season pass DLC thinking i would get the bikes i was missing. Nope, don't have them.

However, the improvements required were obvious and should have been easy for Milestone to fix.  Well, they didn't - in fact, they've made it worse.  Much, much worse.There are virtually no graphics quality settings whatsoever and no AA control at all.  In-game graphics are a bizarre mixture of out-of-focus fuzziness for when in the pit, to glossy realism on the podium, to a jagged mess (due to no AA) on the track.  Bike control hasn't improved, still no proper XB360 controller for PC, exiting the game currently requires CTRL+ALT+DEL and Task Manager, tyre grip still isn't modelled, bike setup is still childishly pointless because it does so little.  And now it's riddled with DLC.I'm a big fan of MotoGP but how on Earth Dorna Sports can let such a potentially fantastic license be ruined by such inept software development is beyond me.  Milestone claim to have fully revamped the game engine but the evidence for this is painfully absent.Don't waste your money on this game."

The throttle response and traction control feedback from this controller is outstanding as it has a hepatic feedback in the brake and throttle triggers.  One I got past the learning curve (no pun intended) the game became very addicting.  The detail at the track (COTA in particular) is very accurate.  Even the billboards and advertising is spot on as seen at each persepctive track.  Finally a motorcycle racing game that I can appreciate.

There is currently no way to adjust the AA, shadows, fog, etc. There also are very apparent bugs present…for example, once in career mode you cannot exit to the desktop without force quitting with the task manager. There is no way to save controller settings. The frame rate slows down and gets choppy and I even have the 2 settings turned off (AFX and High Res textures) where with MotoGP 13 i have everything set to on and high without the slightest hit to framerate.This iteration feels rushed and thus far a single V1.1 patch has not been released since the game came out in June of 2014. If the patch comes out and the improvements are made then I will change my stance. I want to love this game as MotoGP is a passion of mine. As it stands I barely can add the word ""like"" when describing it."
,Not Recommended,256390,12603087,"Posted: 23 October, 2014",all,[OpHe] thecraicbear,"This game is far from optimised for the PC platform. We've been waiting for a patch to fix many bugs, major and minor, since June, and so far we still have a game working at 75%.The community support from Milestone has been terrible since the launch of this game. Communication has never been their strong point for titles like MotoGP, WRC, etc, which I suppose is equally as bad as their efforts to release games which are worthy of being retail releases.Perhaps one of the biggest gripes I have is the limited video options you get with this title. As per usual in a Milestone game, you cannot change the video settings in-game; the launcher is where you have to make your changes, and once you're in-game, that's it. Not only that, but the options you actually get to choose from are dire, and the game, even when bumped up to the highest settings, looks tacky for a PC game. I wouldn't consider myself that much of a graphics snob, but there's a line you cannot go back over once we're into a new generation.There's a good game in here somewhere, but it's surrounded by problems, from stupid to complex. Therefore, I won't be recommending this game, neither will I be recommending any Milestone product until they pull their finger out to improve 1) the quality of their games for release, and 2) their general customer support."

At first it was hard to get used to it but after using the engineer to fix up handling problems this game becomes addictive. Its only a shame that the game is buggy and there doesn't seem to be any update available to fix the  bugs. On my rig I seem to be unable to get out of the game as it lacks the button to quit the game back to Windows. I have to quit the game using task manager. Graphics look good for the game but could do with more optimisation for PC graphics as this seems like a a lazy console port. Not worthy of full price but a bonus bargain at 75% off at sale. Though with anymore bugs in the game then I would definitely have felt ripped off. Buy this game only after taking into account that its release for PC compatibility is just below what a good commercial game release should be. Otherewise as a motoGP game it is a solid game to play for people who fancy racing motorbikes  or is a fan.

It's a shame it's really the only game in town.  Let me say up front that I really do like this game.  That said I do have my fair share of gripes with it.  It seems to perform better than 2013, but for a ""last gen"" game, there really is no excuse for the occasional frame drops I get.Also, the AI is very weak, seems like a step back from last year, which wasn't great.  The AI is so linear with no personality whatsoever and are basically on rails.  Come to think of it, I am almost a season in and have not seen a single crash (that didn't involve me).Also the difficulty is basically useless.  I want to win, but I like a challenge so, like last year, I turn it down a little until I get in the groove and then crank it back up.  However, even on medium difficulty I have issues, but it's more the inconsistency of the AI.  I can go out blind folded on Free Practice, Qualifying, and Warm Up and set the pole by 2 seconds, but on race day, certain tracks, the AI will then go out and out lap you by 3-4 seconds!  Also, I have noticed if the AI is in front of you, they are very difficult, but if and when you manage to get past them, magically they suck horribly and will fall far behind you, whereas if you do not get the position back quickly, they will continue to pull from you and there is little to be done about it.The AI also appears to be bound by a different, more lenient set of physics laws as well, as they are able to hold corner speed that you cannot dream of in general.  Hold tight lines and accelerating faster at full lean, while you're picking the bike up and cannot keep up.  On that same note though some tracks with open fast corners, they always are extremely slow which allows you to blow by them.Anyways, even though this review must sound highly negative, I do enjoy the game, and it offers plenty of fun to be had, and I will continue to keep playing and getting better.Side note: does anyone play this online as I can never seem to find any active lobbies?"
,Recommended,256390,14331129,"Posted: 4 February, 2015",all,Life Pilgrim,"I bought the game while it was on sale. The bikes are beautiful but other than that the graphics are quite outdated including the rain effect.The game is quite hard actually I think you need a proper gamepad to play it properly or to have a chance at podium finish. It has helmet camera and while using it, external sounds are a bit muffled which is a nice touch.It also has a rather annoying bug that disables you from exiting the game most of the time so I'm forced to play in windowed mode to be able to go to task manager to shut the game down. Additonally, change to controls won't get saved either.If you like MotoGP then this game is probably good for you. If you're intrigued by MotoGP this game might fill the void until a better alternative comes.Buy it while it's put on sale by steam."

MotoGP and racing fans in general will be very happy.  I had graphics issues and slow gameplay initially, but found out that it defaults to the Intel graphics card.  Once I got my Nvidia card to work with the game the graphics were great!  Go on google to find the solution (type ""motogp 13 pc not detecting nvidia"" and select the first result).UPDATE 6/22/14:  A few days in, still loving the game but there are some glaring bugs:1.  After playing for a while, when I try to exit the game the prompt does not appear, so I have to alt+tab and exit using task manager in windows.2.  In career mode the menus in the trailer and garage freeze up sometimes.3.  Was qualifying for Le Mans and some of the surfaces on the track were not appearing so it looked like I was riding on clouds most of the time.4.  I preordered the game, but did NOT receive the promised free DLC for the Laguna Seca pack.  Honestly this is what I'm most upset about.Hopefully there will be an update soon that will fix these.UPDATE #2 6/25/14:  Still haven't received the DLC, even though it's advertised on the front page.  Steam took 5 days to respond to my initial inquiry and didn't do anything.

The game is more or less the same except that it looks better on PC, since I can increase the settings a fair deal, and it also seems to have been patched more or better than on console.What's different from MotoGP 13 is that the physics is noticeably different, the bike is trickier and more technical to handle, which I see as a big improvement. I play sim games partly for the technical challenge. There are more game modes as well in MotoGP 14, and more content overall, than in the previous game.The physics is not as sim-like as in Milestone's SBK games, yet is still challenging enough to be fun and rewarding.There's a huge amount of content considering each bike model handles differently from the rest, and you have three MotoGP classes. The DLCs add even more bike models to play around with. So contents galore !In summary, a really good MotoGP game, it has enough changes and new content to make playing it really worthwhile."

76561198064388679,Recommended,256390,23131436,"Posted: 21 May, 2016",all,ZenZone1,"Oh hey, it runs on AMD Radeon HD 6770m! How cool is that huh?Might help sales if the minimum system requirement reflects more accurately what it can run on.Lots of negativity on this title and i got curious as we know sometimes even bad publicity is good publicity no? It was on sale at 85% off so i thought no big loss if it's as bad as the haters say it. From hard to win, to hard to control, to exit bugs and what not, this game has taken a lot of undeserved flak and by extension, the developers. Didn't really want to buy it at first since i already got 13 but the heavy discount made me want to try it for myself and see what all the fuss is about.First, lets talk about the one race (Termas de Rio Hondo) which was exceedingly hard; i got 8th place. Incidentally, that is acceptable for career mode since the team's objective for this round is only 15th place.http://dai.ly/x4anen3Funny that this video haz got more views than my other MotoGP14 videos in which i did well, go figure :DOk, on hindsight, this poor position may be due to the default setup for the bike which usually seems to be set to fail / lose for every track. It's not really bad per se but it's a safe setting that doesn't allow you to push the performance to it's limit. Furthermore, i did not experiment enough with all the setups nor retried the race too many times so maybe i could've done better.  This explains the frequent difficulty in handling the bike around the corners or poor top speed or poor acceleration when you go by the default setups but the above example is an extreme exception. Most of the tracks so far has been quite easy to master. As of this writing i've just completed the 8th round of the Career mode (TT Assen in The Netherlands) but it's not uploaded yet due to having exceeded my daily upload limit.IMO the developers want the players to fiddle with the setups to get the best results and learn in the process rather than hand-hold them all the way to the last race of the season with optimal setups for every track and every bike. Furthermore, as the bike gets upgrades, the optimal setup will need adjustments.The only problem as far as i can see, a minor one at that, is the inability to save custom key bindings. As for the much gripe about difficulty in winning, there's one other oft overlook aspect; bike upgrades. Initially career mode is tough to win even against easy AI. I thought the AI somehow cheated but really, as a newcomer to the sport, no one expects you to win a podium finish. Besides, a new team is likely to have sub-par bike components and inexperience in bike setups so it's a realistic scenario you're put through. You're afterall an unproven rookie rider so don't expect the top teams to take you in.So what about the exit bugs? Well in the beginning i didn't encounter it until i went into the Career mode. So the claims that it occurs in the Career mode is true but only half true. You see it only exists in full-screen (fs) mode. Not sure if it occurs in all fs resolutions but since i started using windowed mode, i've never looked back. You can see for yourself in this video and also in some other videos of mine that exit is possible in Career mode; just need to press Alt-F4. ( ok shameless self-promotion here :p )http://dai.ly/x4bz25iAs for the complaints about the lack of in-game graphic options, well there's some options you can set in the launcher. And if you need more tweaking, you can use manual override in the graphics driver app. For sure the options are not as extensive as in some games but it's enough to allow balance between performance and image quality. A note about graphics quality; many people say it's dated. Maybe so but if you compare the in-game graphics of Losail night race in the rain and the real-life video of the same which you can find in the unlocked video in the Multimedia feature of the game, you'll find that it's a surprisingly accurate rendition of the actual scene; surface reflections and all.In summation, this game is thoroughly enjoyable - just give it a fair chance. As of this writing, i've already put 34 hours into it. Nothing to complain about really and no game breaking bugs. If you're afraid of savegame corruption just make a backup of the savegame directory which can be found in C:\Users\""your username""\AppData\Roaming\Milestone .Final note: Thereplay highlightswhich was present in perhaps all previous MotoGP and SBK series has been removed from this version so you'll have to find your own interesting portion of the replays yourself.Verdict: 7.5/10 Would be 8.5 if the developers didn't skimp on graphics options or game features present in previous iterations. Highly recommended if you don't already own 13, recommended if you're a fan of the series or if you're like me and just want to find out for yourself what's all the hoopla surrounding this release.Unrelated side note: Of all the motorcycle games from Milestone, the one i like best is really Ride just 'coz the scenery is varied instead of just typical track layout. If only Ride has a massive open-world map like Test Drive Unlimited 2 then it would be perfect !!! Either TDU3 needs more motorcycles or Ride needs more open-world. :D"

Motogp 15.Short reveiew: From the racing point of view, a decent game with realistic and professional gameplay. There are issues with sound and graphics.Long review:I am a fan of motogp games and i have realy enjoyed this game. Motogp 14 is a bike racing simulation with realistic physics. There are real names (marquez, rossy...) and the game has enough tuning variety to include you into details.Pros:- Realistic game. Hardcore game :D- Tuning is literaly the key to win or lose a race.- There is an assistant to help you with tuning.- There is a career mode where you can start from scracth and make your way up to being a teammate of valentino rossi.- There is a championship mode, where you can actually be valentino rossi :D- There is a historic battles mode where you play as a 2013 rider in a historic situation like moving from the 4th place to 1st.- There is a challenge the champion mode where you have to do better than your opponent, most of the time a champion.Cons:- Antialiasing is weird. The game has graphical issues. I have resolved it by overriding the game settings with ati driver settings.- The sound is cool but it feels inconsistent. Maybe it is because i am not familiar with it.- The game forgets the control layout of joypad. I have to configure it everytime i open the game.- The game requires Alt + Tab and task manager force kill to be closed when playing with gamepad.If you have this game, don't buy motogp 15 and get used to weird sound and override graphic options from driver. You would like this game as a bike racing game. If you have motogp 15, do not waste your time or money on this."

After a race or two, you can no longer exit the game without using Ctrl-Alt-Del and ending task.2. The graphics are so choppy right at the wrong time. Frame rate drops 5 or 6 times per lap, usually at different parts of the track. It doesn't seem to be related to how many riders are around you, it just stutters terribly, making you run off track. If it wasn't for the rewind function I would never finish a lap.The only way to make the game playable right now is to use RadeonPro or similar to force the refresh rate to 60Hz and push the frame rate as high as possible.When this game is fixed, it will be great. Until then, it sucks."

All are Milestone titles. The SBK series was extremely well polished, great sims, included lots of features, and I enjoyed them thoroughly. The Motogp series, OTOH, has been a bit of a disappointment.Motogp 13 doesn't include SBK standard features such as telemetry data and ghost in time attack mode. Motogp 14 is more of the same. Also, in the SBK series, you had to be extremely careful not to go off track because you'd lose traction if you were on the throttle or brake in anything but an upright position. In Motogp 13, you can pin the throttle while fully leaned over off-track and you'd never have to worry about losing traction. Motogp 14 is more of the same.Motogp 13 had a few bugs but the main one that affected me was the online play. Connectivity through Raknet was horrible. Motogp 14 chose to go with Raknet again so I'm not holding my breath when it comes to multiplayer. Another bug in Motogp 13 was that enabling vsync in-game would cause choppy frame rates. Motogp 14 again has issues with choppy frame rates, remedied somewhat through config.ini modifications, but looks like a step backward compared to Motogp 13. While the replay mode in Motogp 14 looks stunning, in game is a different matter as the lack of anti-aliasing makes for blocky imagery that looks like low-res textures have been upscaled.Another disappointment is the inclusion of more bugs. The controller settings are not saved, forcing you to reinput your settings each time you restart the game. Also, if you play the career mode, the quit option is not accessible, forcing you to use CTRL ALT DEL to quit the game.That being said, I really enjoyed the helmet cam view in Motogp 13, and thankfully Motogp 14's helmet cam retains the same enjoyment. Motogp 14 has also tweaked the physics, limiting your ability to the slide and brake during cornering bringing about a less arcadish experience.Motogp 13 felt like a beta version that was sold to consumers. Motogp 14 feels like more of the same but with even more bugs and graphical issues. A recurring theme of recent Milestone titles appears to be to release untested console ports that force consumers to wait for patches that may never come. While I can find enjoyment in the game, after consecutive releases that have been full of bugs, I've lost faith that future releases from Milestone would be any different. I'd love to see another developer take a shot at Motogp.Purchase at your own risk."

The graphics aren't the best as they promised , and to tell you the truth unless they won't fix it don't ever bother to get in touch with it.The money just gone for nothing, i really try to mention Milestone the bugs i have now , and the sooner the better to notify them."

When I play a good motorcyle game and I find myself riding the bike like I was acually racing I know its a good game. Adjusting bike settings before each racing depending on weather and type of track, looking thru corners, banging the gears down before a tight turn, trying to perfect my racing lines. This is the first Motogp game I got that superbike X game seriers feel. Great game alot of fun."

The use of the wheel for example still hasnt been resolved and the programme lags a fair bit but will try a few thing to see if it stops it . Other than that still getting use to it and will say more later as I am use to it .

,Recommended,256390,15799215,"Posted: 12 May, 2015",all,caseyc (VEGAN),"I was a biker for 20 years so was looking forward to this game, but am unable to play.UPDATE:  New gaming pc and its working. The graphics are certainly outdated already, but its okay. With limited options (they also made ""Ride"") in this genre, i won't be too critical. MotoGP 15 looks much better, probably better off picking up the basic ""compact"" version of it for cheap.Some others mentioned bugs, but not enough to think it would be a issue. Well despite being modest graphics (my pc is fine for most of the latest and greatest games and meets the requirements) in the 5 minutes I was able to play it had frame-rate issues and then just froze up and after a few minutes of CTRL-ALT-DEL, ESC and no responses I had to just turn off the PC without a proper shutdown!  So I restarted, lowered the graphics settings and tried again. It froze up in the menus before even starting this time.  I had very few issues with any of my games or my pc - this game must be full of bugs and don't want to crash my computer over it now so can't play!  Should give refunds for this bs! I think the same issue with Ride, they need to fix games before making new ones. I won't buy from them again."
