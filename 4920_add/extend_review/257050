The general sandbox activities of building and resource gathering are interesting, particularly wiring your base with power and lights.Sadly that is where the upside stops. When I originally purchased this game in beta most all of the things you can now find in the “Future development plan & DLC” were to be included in the game by the time it was released. Especially the story and an ending for the game. An immersive story for a 2D sandbox was one of their main features at that time. However, now the designers have fallen on hard times and have decided to break those promises due to their need for funding. Additionally, work has effectively stopped on this game while they attempt to make a similar companion game to get more funding to finish this one. This information, along with a much longer explanation, can be found on a recent post of theirs on the official forums along with a passive suggestion that it is the purchasers fault for buying it on sale.I realize beta is a fickle thing and you might not always get exactly what you expected. This goes well beyond that however in my opinion. To be realistic, this game by the standards of their original plan is still in beta and was simply rushed to release in an attempt to gain further funding. I whole heartedly recommend against this purchase. The DLC may never arrive at this rate and most of it was originally supposed to be in the actual release. It strikes of an unethical approach to development even if they had the best intentions to start with which is suspect at this point.*UPDATE* It's been several months now since this change in the games direction with no recent news or updates from their main site. Given this was back on April 30th, it's probably fairly safe to assume the game is dead at this point with it being over 6 months."
,Not Recommended,257050,8023203,"Posted: 12 December, 2013",all,Gabeux,"- UPDATED! I no longer recommend this game, don't waste your money on it's current state!Updated Introduction and Summary sections! -[ Introduction ]My opinion about this game WAS very ambiguous: I couldn't say if it was worth buying or not. Now that I sinked in more hours to discover what the game's about, I must label it as DO NOT BUY.The current major version of the game is 1.2 and there's too many bugs (including game breaking bugs), story progression is broken, and there are many unfinished features.Hopefully the review below will shed light on people that haven't bought yet and are looking for an unbiased review (I'm not an early supporter nor an early hater).[ Overview ] :This game is a cross of Under the Ocean and Terraria.It's graphical style is very cool, with nice looking objects, equipment, armor, bases and world.Also, a non-blocky-pixel-sandbox is a great change.You're dropped in a planet that is very dark and the days are very short. The darker it is, the more frequent are monster spawns and some can even get tougher if you fight them in the dark (no worries on that, though, since your armors have lights - once you get some energy storage equipment).Note: I have no idea why a human ship is orbiting such planet and no idea why you crash land in a pod there.You discover the backstory through datalogs you find during exploration.[ Positive Points ] :- Tutorial gets you through the basics, enough to move ahead.- Non-blocky-sandbox.- 3D characters on nice 2D environments.- Tech-tree and rich crafting system comprised of resources and components. Your tools, equipment and armors aren't made only of metal ingots - sometimes you need to make secondary components like rubber and silicon, or more complex ones like a dynamo or motor. It is a fresh and interesting crafting and discovery scheme with great potential.- Diverse lamps, technology, power and wiring makes base building look cool and planning ahead is necessary.- Digging/mining spread of 3 blocks or 1 block, toggleable.- When crafting or researching, the craft/research system takes resources from inside storage containers, like barrels and closets, so you don't have an inventory full of resources everytime you want to do something - you just have to be near your storage.- Some itens takes time to crafting or research, which feels better than ""instant crafting"" in this case.- Elevators, hover-platforms, switches, rifles..technology - nice features.[ Negative points ] :- ANOTHER game that puts ""Survival"" in it's description and features no survival at all. If ""surviving"" aggressive mobs is ""survival"", so all the games that feature aggresive AI is a survival game? There's no need for food, water or sleep, which made me wonder what's the fun in ""surviving"" an alien planet in this situation.- Technical-wise, the game feels like a beta. It seems that every technical detail was made to annoy the player. If you keep autosave on, it will interrupt your game abruptly and prints a big ""SAVING YOUR GAME"" title every time it autosaves, it's terrible. Graphics can't be tuned at all (except toggling 5 or 6 options). This makes playing on older machines really hard or even impossible. Also, turning off dynamic shadows breaks the (bad) lighting system. Last but not least, the game can crash everytime you try to exit it - in my case, forcing me to CTRL-ALT-DEL my way out.- Lighting system is weird (radius/spread/emanation) and annoying for a game that tries to be beautiful. It also doesn't look realistic - underground, you have to put way too many torches because of it.- Performance can be bad for no reason in many situations, leaving me to believe the game isn't optimized at all.- Movement system is annoying. Even if you tap a button, your character starts running, which looks bad and can give you many fall deaths (combine this with poor performance and autosave, guaranteed deaths).- The music, initially ""Okay"", gets repetitive and annoying really quick, and the sound-effects sometimes are awkward or way too loud compared to other effects.- Backgrounds look very ugly and out of place. Also, you can break very deep cave walls, and the background is usually a plain blue color that may or may not emanate light.- Resource gathering and base-building takes a long time compared to other games.- Research system feels weird: you waste the same resources to research a new item that you would use to craft it (also investing research points). It feels like a relabeled leveling system for crafting.[ Summary ]:Based on the points above, the game feels unfinished and lacking heart, which makes it, currently, a DO NOT BUY title. Plus, the devs had the boldness to launch it with no ""Early Access"" label.It would show potential if it was a beta, but it seems the developers think it's safe to say it's an 1.0 (1.2 actually).Even for 10$, it's not worth getting in this: no one should launch an unfinished, buggy and broken game with no warning about it.If the devs leave it in it's current state, this will just be forgotten.For your current sandbox needs, go for Starbound instead - even in BETA it's more finished, polished and stable.I've ditched many hours and still haven't found what the game is about.Don't waste your time."

Sadly that's a greenlight/early access speciality of devs. While the game is fun with the content so far see review below I don't intend to reward bad habits (like selling unfinished games) by recommending the game to anyone.Dev goes on about act 2 etc. but updates indicate he's given up on this product or working on DLCor episode 2.If you don't wanna support this behaviour, don't buy this game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Old review:Had a fun time exploring the content of the game just after release. (31 hrs on record) Felt unpolished but the devs still add to the game and also Terraria wasn't quite finished after release. I'll be returning to the game once there's more content and the plot completed.As you see on the pictures you explore a dark planet (as a stranded astronaut). Creatures spawn aggressively in the dark so you put up lights and build a shelter. You dig down to get rarer metals, craft better armors and weapons. You know the formula.Looks and atmosphere are the selling point as the game is prettier than some of its competitors and feels claustrophobic in the dark depths filled with horrors. Despite being a Terraria-like the game has its own feel to it unlike say ""Edge of Space"" which I still find slow-going with a cumbersome control.Concepts like electric wiring or rails aren't properly explained ingame but are fun once you figured out/read how they work.Can recommend for a fun experience and will only become better over time."

Actually playing the game proved that screenshots didn’t lie: Darkout is by far the most beautiful game in 2D sandbox exploration/building genre, and while I believe that graphics isn’t that important, great graphics like this certainly adds to enjoyment.Graphics aside, Darkout has decent crafting and building system; there is a fair (but by no means spectacular) selection of decorative items to craft, and some interesting features, like research system or necessity to connect most advanced work stations to your base’s power grid.Overall, Darkout has interesting early to mid-game. Finding resources and progressing can be quite challenging, as even early enemies can be deadly when you are poorly equipped, and environment itself can present hazards like long falls or deadly tar pits. As you progress through the game, however, the challenge diminishes, not increases: while you start encountering stronger enemies, their strength increase doesn’t match your stronger weapons and armor, and eventually even hardest areas become a walk in a park with late-tier sword and armor.Aside from drastically diminishing challenge, as you keep playing you will eventually find Darkout rather lacking in variety: there are only 3 surface biomes, not counting very small and very empty coastline biome, and flying islands biome that looks the same as surface jungle biome (other than being composed of flying islands, naturally). There are several different underground layers, but only major difference between them is the music and what kinds of resources you can find there. Also, there is only one boss, and it can only be fought after a rather long questline.In the end, despite its flaws, Darkout is a good enough game, and if you are a fan of 2D sandbox exploration/building genre, Darkout will likely give you many hours of enjoyment."

In addtion parts of it is extremely grindy and unfun. It literally took me a day or two to find a single core I was looking for, and I needed 8. Additionally, some materials are so rare you will spend days looking for them.Development Notes:This game is extremely slow on releasing any patches (only one minor bug patch in a year). The community page and forums are mostly dead and the developer rarely releases any notes on what is going on. In fact it took quite some time for them to inform the community that they lost a core member of their team, were dropping multiplayer support. All and all the dev is extremely un-responsive to the community. The dev laid out a 3 stage content plan for the game. Stage 1 is not complete and baised off of the recent development woes I do not think they will be able to get out a stage 2 or 3.Closing:I cannot recommend this game in its current state because it is rarely updated and the dev has terrible communication skills with their community.

They explained why in their most recent announcements...2) If you have already paid for the ""full"" game, you have actually only paid for ""stage one."" They are going to release stages 2-4, which include the story itself, as paid DLC. So if you want to finish the game, you MUST buy more DLC from them. They have to do this because they aren't making enough money.So what should you do? If you really think you want this game, wait till it is COMPLETELY finished and buy it along with all its DLC for one low price on sale. Otherwise, you may end up buying half the game that can only be finished when they release more DLC. Shady business ahead. Purchase at your own regret."

,Not Recommended,257050,17428404,"Posted: 7 August, 2015",all,Talishan,"So i purchased this game back in beta and played it a bit, I leave my games open on steam when I'm sleeping and such, so I've played it about 1/3 what my profile shows.  That's still enough to get a good feel for the game.  Back then I stopped playing because there were some pretty game breaking bugs when you got far down the tech tree and the story was almost non existent and what was there was pretty buggy.  So I stopped playing to wait for the game to be finished, quite happy with my taste of the game and looking forward to the full version.  I've checked on it a few times since then, but now it's been over a year and I find this... the game will never be finished.  They released it without finishing all the things that I was promised and want more money for DLC that will finish the game.  Considering how badly they've neutered themselves with this move, it's more likely they will never make this DLC anyway.  To top it all off, they complain that the reason is people buying it on steam sale... well I'm pretty sure I bought it at full price, I remember something like $14.99, because I believe in supporting indie games and I could afford it at the time.  Insulting players who couldn't afford or didn't want to pay that much is just wrong.  Having said that, I paid $14.99 for a game that will never be finished and has the same features set as games you can get for 4.99-9.99... Now I don't mind that per se, but I spent that money expecting the features that were promised, I may have been able to afford the game, but I'm not rich, that 14.99 could buy me a game that I will actually enjoy, because I'll never get to play this game for 100s of hours like I wanted to when it was finally finished. That being said, below is my review on the parts of the game that exist.Pros:*Very nice aesthetic, lighting effects and such.  For a 2-D game it's quite beautiful.*Interesting Research and fun building, you can do some cool stuff farther up the tech tree*This game can suck up a good deal of time, it's addictive to a point, but there's a limitCons:*Game becomes repetitive after awhile, mostly due to lack of content, there's plenty of sandbox building, but not much else*Game is still relatively buggy, and world files can actually become corrupted, forcing you to start on a new world*Story may as well not exist, the story elements are boring, there are no real quests or missions, every bit of it is basically ""go find these capsules that have your quest items in it and then come back and put them in your satelite dish.*ORIGINAL PROMISES NOT MET - that's the killer for me right there."

I don't care.So why the positive opinion, surely i can see the game is a broken heap of promises? literally Hitler etc?Well no. When it comes to failed Early Access games it really is so that failed EA games on steam can be roughly grouped so that some are big scams made by a egotistical dev that bans everything that moves, Others become leftovers from too ambitious plans.  Darkout is big on the too ambitious plans department. It has lots of potential that partly shows - but will never be fully unlocked.It is true that this game is 'just another broken down Early Access story' as i can only assume development is stopped and no patches are coming. even for the basic bugs such as elevators.  Surely this state is so bad that this game is now worth zero ...right? Again no. I wasn't there when the promises were made and instead i got this game very cheaply so i can honestly say 'anything goes' as long as it's at least semi entertaining.So i boldly installed the game and set my aim trying to get atleast some 2-10 hours of gameplay. Since i only paid some euros surely i will get something for that?Turns out i will get a lot more than that. This game is no Terraria substitute when it comes to gameplay hours so nothing like in the hundreds of hours but tens of hours are pretty much guaranteed and more if you use achievements as a motivator. This game can hold out against Starbound on it's own - at least for awhile before the lack of diversity in biomes and mechanics start to weight in on it (Starbound itself is not a very 'happy camper' either - could be in better shape as it's been in Early Access for a very long time).  Ok so how about Edge of Space?...um. no.that one is a EA chapter on it's own. And then...well there are not that many sidescrolling open world sandbox scifi-survival games that rely on darkness as a element. I am all ears if someone has something like this that blows the competition out of the water and isn't a metroidvania lite-sandbox like Asteria.So unless you get hit by game not working on Windows10, story data modules not appearing or something else that prevents the game from running properly then you are in for a pretty decent and scary survival treat in the darkness.Early to mid game is the best this game has to offer. Remember that feeling in Terraria when you went undreground in low wood/copper tier garbage equipment? fearing heights?  That feeling lasted for a very short time. In this game it is constant companion for hours to come and only later will you be able to tackle it partially. Heights just for once is a big problem you will have to deal with and finding the blueprints and ores you need is no small thing. Exploring the colorful but dark caves is hard and dangerous work in this game but down to the mines you must go.I definitely recommend getting this game on a sale. After installing it leave the prejudices out and also dont look at the (outdated) wikis unless you are completely stuck. Learn the UI and off you go. The best part is the early game: The road from sticks and stones to iron and beyond is a long one and full of peril and i have enjoyed myself so far more than what i expected."

,Recommended,257050,7939130,"Posted: 6 December, 2013",all,Jorkfriend,"This game is actually really cool, it saddens me Starbound is going to overshadow it completely. Before I even get into it, I'm going to say this game is quite like Terraria in the sense you're plopped into a world without being told much of anything. You have similair freedoms and goals to do to progress, you build a shelter, mine some ores, but unlike Terraria, Darkout has you research new things you can craft which is a system that works pretty well. As for starbound, comparing starbound to darkout isn't exactly fair as Starbound is in beta and these two games aren't trying to do the same thing at all.This game has a heavy sci-fi element, which is a nice change of pace from being in a psuedo-fantasy setting. You'll be utilizing high tech things like the Combiner to craft stuff, creating and using guns with special ammo, and a bunch of other neat stuff I haven't learned how to do yet. Obviously it has high emphasis on crafting, but it's different from Terraria in the sense that you need to research new recipes rather than pure trial and error. If you should ever run out of things to research, try to find and decode data modules from salvagable wreckage scattered on the planet's surface, or craft things you researched as this may open up new opportunities.Now that I've gotten that out of the way, you start the game having crashlanded onto some weird shadow-dimensional planet with things from bioluminescent forests, to strange occultish outlands. I'll go ahead and list the positive things about this game. The art style, graphics, and especially the lighting is incredible, I've never seen 2.5d done this well, I was pretty impressed with how awesome my mining area ended up looking when at the end of the day it's just a series of caverns. One of my favorite things in this game is the ""Auto"" feature that's assigned to slot 1 left mouse, it basically means you don't need to put an axe/pickaxe/shovel on your hotbar and manually equip them just to chop trees/mine ore, it does all that for you upon using the function. Tools don't have durability either as far as I can tell, so you won't be needing to craft new ones every 5 minutes.Now for the negative things I have to say about the game. The animations on both the player and monsters can be strange sometimes but that's the least of the bad things. The tutorial doesn't tell you several essential things to know, such as Shift+Right Mouse will pick up already placed torches/furniture/items you dropped on the ground. The controls are somewhat clunky, but you'll get used to them pretty fast. While the game has a decent soundtrack and great atmosphere, the sounds mobs make when you hit them are really badly done which I found pretty strange.As for the combat, it's a bit worse than Terraria's, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the combat is awful as I find it mediocre at best. You seem to be fighting strange shadow creatures, as far as I can tell you need to use both light to get their shields down, then you can hurt them with generic physical damage. I've just been using my Glow Torch as a melee weapon since it's both emitting light and doing physical damage. If you played Alan Wake, you know how the story goes with shadow creatures.Overall, do I recommend this? Yes, but only if you liked games such as Terraria. I would recommend Starbound as well, but I can't say I like Starbound better than Darkout, nor Darkout better than Starbound. They're both really good in their own ways, plus Starbound is far from finished so it's not exactly fair to make a comparison just yet as Darkout is not an early access title."

I guess I wanted to switch to a more sci-fi setting after dealing with bows and arrows for so long. I like the crafting progression, e.g. you don't use the useless torch the entire game like in some cases but move up to better lights. Also the user interface improves usability a lot in some cases. I love the AUTO feature, where you just have all the tools (axe, shovel, etc.) in your inventory and then the game automatically selects the correct one. I never realized how much of a useless chore it is to change between different tools manually. Also there are other nifty features, like opening two containers and moving stuff between them without actually having to pick it up yourself, etc. I also like that you can extract more valuable resources (copper, iron, etc.) from sand and stone (albeit not very efficiently, which is good for balancing reasons). Instead for having chestfuls of useless dirt and stone (I don't like to throw stuff away), you can simply chuck it all into the machinery and convert some of it to better materials. The game is not perfect, but I am having a lot of fun playing it. The most important thing is that they are still improving it. And the essential thing is that it's not alpha or beta or whatever that smells like early access. The game is done and playable as it is, so you don't have to wait forever for them to develop it and wipe your world in the process. I'm going to stop talking now and go play the game some more. Cheers."

It had so much potential in the beginning, but the devs stopped working on it and stopped communicating with the players. Yes there was some talk about finnishing the game and releasing it as paid DLC (you have to buy the game agin, basically an insult to the playerbase.) this is a mess and it makes me sad that it got dropped for whatever reason.

Your character feels ""floaty"" and is prone to getting stuck, the enemies are sometimes so vague and non-chalant that you don't even realize they're enemies until they've started to attack, and at the very beginning of the game, I found I had to murder myself because I began skipping the never-ending slew of tutorial pop-ups, only to find out I can't progress without my (now unreachable) ship salvage.It seems like there would be a promising game underneath the surface, but in its current state it's a muddled, hand-holding mess that relies extensively on the use of control-map tooltips to give some of the most basic information, and then entirely omits the simplest things, such as how to remove a placed object, or pick one up that you've (inevitably) accidentally dropped.Riddled with odd typos, frustrating HUD, UI and crafting elements, Darkout feels bizarrely unfinished for a completed product, and plays more like an Early Access title.  I still find myself desperately wanting to enjoy it, but buyer beware:  This is not something that you'll find you can pick up and play without scouring through clunky tutorials just to figure out where they put that damned button.If it's ""Terraria in space!"" you're looking for, just go invest your time in Starbound.  This would have been an intriguing title had it come out a year or more ago, or had it more time to be polished into something that didn't require that you were all but forced to read in-game manual after in-game manual just to learn how to play the game, rather than the game teach you how its played in way that's more interesting than shoving your face in a textbook and inhaling."

While I can't disagree with that, to a degree, Darkout carries with it a much more fun atmosphere for me. The gameplay itself is great, with all the things that I've taken to enjoying from games from the Terraria format but the addition of light being used as a kind of weapon, I love that mechanic. Couple that with significantly better graphics than it's counterparts and it's a fully functioning game. Darkout is by far my favorite of this genre at this point. Add in also that it actually feels SCI-FI, which the others don't do until late, late tiers, and it takes the cake for me.The only two really annoying things that I've found is that the game doesn't tell you the importance of the destroyed beacons you pick up and that it has a tendancy to crash due to what seems like autosave issues. SAVE THE BEACONS. You need something like 6 to progress the story. And you can turn off autosave which seems to help with the crashing issue, just manual save.Overall, I recommend Darkout for a great single-player experience of the Terraria-style gameplay. Multiplayer is supposed to be en route but who knows."

It feels a lot like a single player Terraria with a focus on a dark atmosphere and an interesting story (such as it is). Carving out a small place of safety in a harsh and outright malicious world is very satisfying, along with slowly but surely improving one's tech tree and equipment in order to be able to explore harsher areas and recover tiny tidybits about those who came before you and what happened to them.It really is a shame this game was never completed, but there is still a lot of gameplay available to those willing to give it a try.

I find the crafting, mining, and exploring - while not totally intuitive - very entertaining, it's mainly because of the fact you're not told much - and are left to work out what the hell is going on, and what you've got to do - that makes it entertaining.There's plenty of stuff to do in Darkout: build structures, dig tunnels, find resources, run out of resourses - find some more, slay the creepy denizens of Toxteth (my randomly generated world!), research and craft better kit and machines to help you slay those denizens. Granted, other games have done this, and in a similar style - but Darkout has the added bonus of excellent 2.5D graphics, good lighting, and some nice effects that give the game a kind of dark - but also colourful - atmosphere. Darkout also has the added bonus of being quite a relaxing game to play, mainly because of the contrasting darkness and vibrant colours.In summary: Darkout deserves a lot more recognition, it reminds me in a way of the old 2D Metroid games - it has a similar feel when playing - with a liberal dash of Minecraft thrown in. I really like the game, but be warned... they mostly come at night.... mostly."

I have played pretty much all of the recent 'sandbox block builders' like Terraria, Starbound, Edge of Space, Windforge, Asteria, Signs of Life, etc and I find Darkout to be the most enjoyable Single Player experience yet. It has a great many sci fi items to craft and the building mechanic is very easy and fast to use, similar to Starbounds and superior to Terraria imo. Combat is fast paced and fun with the weapons responsive. I have been playing the game exstensibly now for about a week and have yet to see a single crash, it is very stable. The gfx are smooth with no performance issues whatsoever and the character is easily controllable. The spelunking is great fun and ive often found myself saying 'im off to bed' only to still be awake many caves later! A very enjoyable experience so far and Im looking forward to seeing the new content thats been promised by the devs.If, like me, you have read some of the negative reviews and posts for this game and are 'umming and ahhing' about purchasing because of it then id really advise you to give Darkout a chance. I have yet to experience any of the so called game ending bugs or glitches and ive been playing it all day solid for the last few days. The only bug I have found is a very minor irritation at most, sometimes when dragging an item out of your inventory the item will be dropped from your cursor to the floor or placed in a storage device if you happen to be stood near one. Finding the next Story log can be a bit random but the devs have said there will be more story structure to come. On a final note the only thing lacking is a co op mode to play with your mates, once that is included, as the devs have said it will be, then I think Darkout will be a real gem of a game.UPDATE :After 100+hrs of play there are a couple of things I should add to the above. Firstly there could be alot more variety to the mobs, yes there are several types but they do all feel a bit samey. Whilst I stand by what I said previously that the audio is nice there is a distinct lack of ambient sounds. Whilst not immediately apparent it can make the world feel a bit more sterile than it would otherwise and as the gfx are so atmospheric the ambient audio can be conspicuous by its absence. Finally the main issue I had after so many hrs of play is the definite lack of endgame content. On Terraria I have over 300+ hrs mainly due to endgame content that I played with a friend but there really is nothing to do in Darkout endgame other than building projects once all research is done and you have explored all biomes.I have still had a great time playing Darkout even with the negative aspects above and £10 for 100+ hours of entertainment is a great deal by anyones standards, so still very recommended just be aware of the longevity of it in its current form. According to the developers there is alot more content to come so hopefully that will address the issues mentioned here."

Why Darkout in particular? Well, the standard answer is if you liked the others, you should like this one. What makes this different? The lighting & light mechanics are the new thing, aside from the graphics being a lot less pixel-y than the others. The graphics really are nicely done, even at this early stage (with limited character appearance choices). The lighting effects are cool, and the availability of light is very import... even more than just knowing where your character is going. Light helps manage the shadow creatures on the planets, and this is even more obvious when you start delving underground or otherwise expanding your mastery over the world.Is the game worth it? Yes, as an Early Access game, there's enough to warrant a buy. Is it better than Edge of Space or Starbound? If you care more about graphics & lighting, and the impact of light on exploration & survival (i.e. more horror/survival than Starbound's survival-y survival), then consider this one. Until they are all finished, it's hard to say one or the other will be the best purchase, however."

After playing it again this is what i came up with=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=1. This review might be a bit longer.2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will delete your comment]=REVIEW=So this game has changed since i last played it. My last review was about the long loading times and how confusing the game was.The game is still a tad confusing since it is a game just like Terraria where you get thrown into a world and have to move on from that point but it is much easier then before. The little tutorial leads you through mining, building and construction fast and gets you your own shelter. From that point on you are on your own.The game before was similar to what it is now. I did give it a thumbs down though due to the fact that the loading times for the game and the world were so big. I was sitting here at one point, the excact same PC, and waited for an hour until i decided to ALT+F4 the game and just delete it. Now even on a big world i am only waiting for about a minute and that is already a big plus. I wrote in my first review: ""If you would be able to play it."" Well you most certainly are able to play it now.There are some problems with the game though. Ingame you start with a starterkit, what is totally fine. The tutorial leads you to your very own shelter, that you have to build, but what is also totally fine. From that point on though you are completly alone. Of course that is what the game is about but you dont know anything about your controls or how to deal with placed objects that you want to get rid of (BTW you hover over the object and hit Q).Due to a lack of options the game has a few FPS issues and also graphical issues. The game is very beautiful but i noticed some graphical glitches. I dont know if that only occured to me but that is just what i saw so it will end up here. In total the game also isnt running as smooth as it should. And my PC can handle high definition games.But overall the game is good. It is as hard as Terraria and in some points even harder but still enjoyable. The crafting is easy to manage and building, even though a bit tricky, is easy just as well.So would i reccommend this game to a gamer that has not bought the game yet?If you have spare money: YesBut if you have a different game with the same price you also want i would reccommend for you to buy the other game first."

76561198116786626,Recommended,257050,8009456,"Posted: 11 December, 2013",all,Digital Dragoon,Darkout consists of two gaming formats mixed together to create one interesting game experience. A side scrolling platform game and a crafting game.The introduction of this game beautifully presents the game well with detailed graphics and a good opening soundtrack.My first impressions of this game was frustration but with a little time I began to understand the idea of the game and it's goals. The main storyline is a little weak at the moment. So you are left to work things out on your own. However I do believe the creator's are currently working on the storyline.The crafting element of this game is like solving one process which then reveals more crafting processes to solve. The rewards for creating something new is satisfying as it is something new you can place in you own designed shelter. I would not go as far to say that the designs of shelters in the game are endless but there are a lot of layout possibilities.There is no time challenges whatsoever in this game which makes it an enjoyable logical problem solving game. So even if you have crashed landed on a unknown planet there is a relaxing attitude to the ongoing problems ahead of you.The challenges it presents do become addictive after a couple of hours of play. It is one of those games that will keep you returning now and again for more. It's replay value is good as you can create something a little different in a new location every time.The in-game graphics are nicely detailed creating beautiful alien world environments. The lighting in the game looks natural and the glowing effects of plants and creature work well in the alien environments.The sound effects are done well adding to the atmosphere of the alien world around you.Controls are simple but can be a little annoying at times however you set them up.This is a good game to get involved in. I definitely recommend this game. As it is a Greenlight game it is by far complete. But with a bit more work this game could potentially be fantastic. The creator's of this game appear to be listening to the players and are actively responding.

As far as bugs I have only encountered a rash of broken worlds when I was transferring computers, but I was more than happy to start from a clean slate with my new, much improved computer. It does require a pretty strong system to run without constant lags and freezes, I imagine this is due to some lack of optimization that'll be cleared up in the future. But if you can run this at it's full potential then there is little that is more rewarding. It does, as most games that involve mining, take a little luck and A LOT of patience to really form a thriving base, but there is little that could rival the beauty of four whirring fusion reactors in a titanium fortress with colored lights throughout. Devs have not been  very active due to some serious roadblocks, but if enough people read this, and buy it then activity will pick up, so BUY IT!Update: I am trepidatious. After a long time of absolutely nothing from the devs they release a statement that says that they will be releasing DLC's to finish the game. If they had been at least releasing small updates and micro patches to keep the game running and showing an effort to hold customer attention I would not mind A (1!!!) DLC to see to it that this would go to the end. However, the dev's fortitude is definitely admirable. I just question how viable DLC's and a second game are going to be. I had my fun with what is on this so if the DLC's fail then I cannot complain about the money I spent. However, it is a bit shady to come up this short after such a long time. I still recommend it because it is still good, but I am unsure of the future. Hold for future updates.Update: I expect this to be my last. This game has a great atmosphere and an excellent system, but the developers are too busy to really make it work to its full potential. It has been 8 months since we last heard from the devs after 6 months or more with no word from them. These words feel weird to type, but this game is abandoned.

It's now been 7 months with no new news, and Allgraf's Facebook, Twitter, forums are all dead or spam-filled.Switching my recommendation to a big fat NO.  If Adrian Banninga or Allgraf Studios are still around, they're certainly not focused on their customers.-- ORIGINAL REVIEW --I love this game and really hope the developers finish it and/or release more content some day.  If you want an incredibly beautiful sandbox mining, exploration, crafting, base building game in a very different SciFi atmosphere then Darkout is a great choice.  Environments, mobs, players and locations are all very well done.  Combat is decent but not ground-breaking.  Crafting is deep and can be a little confusing but the rewards for climbing the tech tree are consistent and fun.There is a story, but it's more like background flavor at this point.  There is no ending or defined final objective, although there is a boss type creature you may encounter (but cannot fight).The game was supposed to be survival-ey, but there's no food or exposure system, enemies cannot penetrate even the simplest of shelters, and no harvesting is required to run your power generators... so ""survival"" is reduced to not being killed by mobs when you leave home.I still hope someday we see some things that were on the 'to do' list, including a real final objective to the game, enemy base attacks with mobs digging/breaking into bases, and multiplayer.So yes... I recommend it for what it currently is - a beautiful exploring, crafting and base building game.If you want a full story or a more survival-like experience then sadly you should look elsewhere."

The atmosphere is oppressive and you're glad to find whatever light source you stumble upon or assemble.Still, there are a few points I feel bad about :- The absence of a map showing your position and the territories you've explored, thus you can lose your way easily.- The randomness of the world means you can have difficulties accessing even basic materials, such as coal, water, or sand.

The obvious comparisons to the likes of Terraria and Starbound don't really do it justice. For one thing, it sticks much closer to its sci-fi roots. The guns in this game are very well done, and the armors feel like survival gear at lower levels and full environment suits in later levels.Finally there's the central draw of this game: using light as a weapon. It IS a very dark game, but there are plenty of items that can - and SHOULD - be used as light sources. The various shadow creatures hit softer and take a lot more damage in a well-lit area. A particular brilliant bit to exploit this is that the various guns (once you have a power source for your armors and batteries to charge those power sources) have a tactical flashlight. This means your shotgun will weaken them before you even fire it.All in all, there are worse games to buy. It's an interesting interpretation on a market that's quickly being saturated with unimaginative clones."

76561198010706706,Recommended,257050,20370002,"Posted: 7 January, 2016",all,Kaldari,"I first picked this up back in October 2014, played it for a good few hours, then put it aside. Started playing it again a couple of weeks ago and found that development seems to have ceased some time ago.The game isn`t fully finished (and likely never will be) and the devs have disappeared, ""So why are you recommending it?"" I hear you say.Well, that`s because what is present in the game is actually quite good. I`ve played various 2D side scrolling crafters, and Darkout is a definite step up, it`s a real shame it won`t be 'finished'.For one thing, it looks really nice, I mean really. The textures are smooth, the backgrounds are actually worth studying, never mind the foreground. The art team have made an effort and it shows (especially in the stratosphere).The whole concept of the plants and creatures adapting to the darkness makes for an interesting change to the usual environment. Just moving through the jungle biome with all the glowing plants and the fireflies drifting around is surprisingly enjoyable. As is taking the jetpack above the clouds and exploring the skylands.I`ve yet to craft the underwater propulsion doodad, so I don`t know what (if anything) is to be found in the depths of the ocean.The crafting. There is a lot of stuff to play with. Build power generators and lay wiring networks to connect up lights, teleporters, elevators, gun turrets, and your crafting stations. One definite thing I love is that you don`t need materials in your inventory. Heave everything into chests/closets/storage vaults and as long as the container is nearby then the game knows what`s there, and draws whatever you need from wherever it is.I haven`t reached the end of the tech levels so I haven`t yet came across any gamebreaking bugs that others have encountered. In saying that, the elevators are a little...quirky, I suspect mostly due to their speed.One of the biggest issues seems to be finding the datacubes, but I found all I needed pretty quickly (so far anyway). Once I went to the relevant biome the mobs were dropping the cubes like confetti at a wedding.Yes, it can be a little grindy and repetitive (if you`re intent on quick completion), but I think I`ve found that with most games like this, and I do find it amusing to see people complaining about the story. After all, I don`t recall Minecraft having a riveting plot...I`m not really focussing on reaching the endgame as soon as possible. My goals at the moment are:- build storage tanks for all the tar I come across (there`s a feature/bug involving liquids and buckets which means tar and water are unlimted, but underground tar pools are still a nuisance)- dismantle the city for all that lovely titanium- find those damn crystal caverns- use my newly crafted GPS to find sea level, then drill a tunnel from my base to the shore (why move to the beach when you can bring the beach to you? ;) ) so I can use the limitless waters of the ocean to drown the underworld.... Muah hah hah hah"
,Recommended,257050,7945355,"Posted: 6 December, 2013",all,rkenney525,"Darkout is a great 2d platformer sandbox that is fun to play and makes promises for good things to come in the future.  I'll break the game down into a few categories, make an analysis, and then leave it up to the reader whether or not the game is worth the price.Graphics:Arguably the least important part of the game, but let's start here.  The style used is a bold attempt to use more modern graphics (in contrast with terraria and minecraft) into the sandbox arena.  While the graphics do create a beautiful environment in the few biomes I've been in so far, to overall feel is admitedly a bit awkward.  A few times I've been hit by jellyfish floating behind trees that I cant even see!  The graphics style changes the way you interact with the environment.  For the first time (that I've seen), blocks are no longer immediatley distinguishable.  This makes it harder to build precise sized structures, but it makes things look much better when they're done.Controls:The first comment I have is about the wonderful idea to map pairs of items to the hotkey bar.  It's very intuitive and maximizes the use of the mouse.  However, since I'm not used to mapping things way, it makes it a bit difficult to think of useful pairs.  Otherwise, the rest of the controls are fairly obvious.  However, there are a few controls that are less obvious, but I'll mentin that in the next section.Gameplay:So unlike most sandbox games, there is a fairly detailed story.  When you create your first world, you get introduced both to the game and to the controls via a tutorial.  The tutorial seemed a little awkward and unresponsive, and didn't mention things I didn't already know like how to pick up an item (it's shift+right-click BTW).Another key point to this game is the research system.  Everything you do gets you research points, and you use research points to research new items to create.  Instead of having the ability to build everything off the bat, you have to find and discover resources and then research various uses of them.  It's pretty cool.  Another great thing is that you dont have to constantly consult the wiki on how to build something (sometimes in terraria, always in minecraft).  You can view every possible thing you've researched at any time and see what the ingredients are, regardless of if you have them in your inventory.Conclusion:While it has its flaws, the game is still very fun to play.  Considering the fact that the game is still being worked on extensivley, I see no reason to judge its flaws too critically."

I stranded in some dark would of another planet, the tutorial hints told me to collect wood by catting trees. So wa walked a bit to a side and fell in some small pond - but no chance to get out even though it was not very deep. So that was my first death. I tried again a few times, but no chance. When I finally got some wood on other side, the tutorial told me to craft some stuff, to male small free field and to build the shelter. While I was still was figuring out how to even move properly and to place the blocks, the first creatures attacked me while I still had no idea how to defend or if I even have a weapon. The tutorial said that if the auto-slot is active, alwas the most adequate tool will be used automatically. there was also a weapon symbol sometimes when I pointed at the creature but my char did not attack it, not even with fists. So I looked into my inventory again and found a pistol. But that didn't work either. I don't know if it required any ammuniton or something. Aftera lot of dieing and respawning I by accident I found that the glow torch works as weapon - if it's active. It gets automatically deactivated whe you place blocks or start digging. After a lot of dying and respawning, running out of wood blocks while still have no proper flat area for shelter, I gave up. Not even the digging and placing of blocks is an easy task. The char mines 3 blocks at a time not the one I selected. He starts swimming when in water which goes not even to his chest, but is then unable to get out of it.

I will also point out that I have almost all survival games, both full release and early access (aside from those that are in a style I have no interest at all in).  I mostly play single player as well.That being said, as far as early access games and other games of the like, I really do not see what people are really complaining about.  I have never had any crashes or like problems of the like with this title.  While not cutting edge graphics, is certainly a step above the regular pixel graphics.  The concept is pretty neat and unique for the most part.  Has elements shared with other like titles, but still shines through in ways.I'd say in games to compare it to would be Terreria, Starbound, Crea and Signs of Life (from my collection)..maybe a few others.  Much better graphics than most, about equal or a little ahead of Signs of Life and passing the others.Sound..I turn music off..so no input there.Ease of creation...I found Terreria to be a pain..this has a pretty decent system of sorts.  Making sure you have the power I think is biggest thing.Much digging for most things, enemies can get a little rough.I'd say complaint wise:ust isn't real ""Big"".  Starbound is HUGE with several planets, but most of these titles (aside from that one) just don't really have that, so can not complain too much.  More along the lines of a wish list sort of thing.How much can you really ask for at the price though...it is not like they are selling for big title prices ($60) and have huge teams with much resources at their disposal...so price is on par.After a while just is no real point.  You build yourself and base up and that is it...just some grinding and are golden.  Would have liked to have a bit more there.I guess that is all I can say about that offhand.  I like it.

The general story is that your character has been stranded on an uncharted planet that is constantly dark, and you have to find resources and research different items to survive.  Now, it sounds all well and good on paper, but if the two former games are it's parents, then this is the resulting child after Minecraft took thalidomide during pregnancy.  It's bad, not Ride To Hell Retribution Bad, or Duke Nukem Forever awful, but it's close.  It has an awful interface, it crashes more than Oblivion packed with mods in the wrong order, making it playable for no more than 5 seconds and when its not wanting to crash, it bugs out and lags even on my high end computer.  When your trying to dig or mine it won't let you half the time, and you have to line up your mouse perfectly so you can, except, as a rule, it  has to be lined up a mile away from the object your trying to interact with.  However the worst thing about this game, and I say the worst thing, is that there is no sense of direction.  I seriously had no clue on how to play or what to do.  Even after reading the manuals in the main menu, I still felt as lost as a Christian in a Marilyn Manson gig.  It's as if one developer thought ""Hey, you know how there is that time in Minecraft where you get really bored because you have no clue what to do, well how about we increase that feeling by making the players have no clue what to do at the beggining of the game,""  And the rest, instead of just killing him, by bludgeoning him to death with his own shoes, nodded and agreed.  Now I know the game isn't 100% finished, before I start getting complaints, but neither was Minecraft and we all loved that for some strange reason.  The difference is we only got bored of Minecraft recently, while Darkout is just plain bad to begin with!"

Darkout is a shameless attempt at replicating the success of other crafting games, no doubt. However, as tempting it is to mock and jeer at posers leaching off of other people’s good ideas, it is quite difficult to keep up the scorn if they do such a good job at it that it sometimes eclipses the original source of inspiration while bringing up new ideas and bouts of creativity.Darkout can easily stand on it’s own rather than being a game people only turn to when they can’t get access to other crafting games. It has a steep learning curve, but otherwise it has everything a crafting game needs; resources, blueprints and places to build to your heart’s content. It also has an odd focus on lighting as a play mechanic and power consumption, which is different than almost all the other crafting focused games, but the game's ambition also has its minor hiccups.The basic idea is that the player is a futuristic survivor that crash landed a spaceship on a planet that becomes more dangerous the darker it is. The survivor's goals boil down to savaging his/her way off the planet by exploring it, cultivating it, and finding out what happened to the other survivors through traces they left behind. The game is almost spooky in this way and playing tag in the dark while aliens are trying to eat you can be thrilling, but the same clash of elements that make the game interesting can also give way to long boring stretches.For instance, the games’ learning curve and complete lack of direction more or less haunts the player the entire game if they are new. While using your own smarts is most of the fun, there are times where a bit of direction is needed. The best examples of this are usually when there are obvious solutions to problems the game won’t allow for; The player starts with a gun and ammo and then runs out the first night only to be forced to discover by accident that only torches, not obvious deadly sharp things like your axe, can be used to beat monsters to death until enough points and materials are earned to make a sword and arrows. Other oddities such as the player will invent things that run on a power source before they know how to build a power source also exist causing unexplained confusion.In conclusion, the when player is on the roll inventing and discovering in the right order Darkout flows perfectly and really adds to that sense of thrilling survival, but when something is thrown out of whack and the randomly generated world gives out some secrets before others sometimes the pacing grinds to a frustrating crawl that leaves the player digging for long stretches searching for that next blueprint or that one unique material that doesn’t seem to be anywhere. Pacing disruptions are it’s only real fault however, and the rest of the games seems to function well enough so there is no reason not to try it anyway. There is some great fun to be had here and players are encouraged to see it for it's own unique qualities."

There are a couple of drawbacks.  The controls have a little bit of a learning curve, so don't expect to know how to play from the start, they are different enough from other 2D builder games that  you will have to take some time to learn them.  There are a few bugs, not too many, and nothing game breaking, but the patchs have been comming once or twice a week, so I'm sure they'll get squashed.

It realy did seem like my kind of thing, and the fact it had bumped the technology and graphics up from sprite based intreuged me. I must say that the general astethics of the game also realy looked like something i would enjoy.And seeing phrazes like ""The love child of Terraria and Metroid"" really helped, seeing as those are two things i like.Darkout does something most worldbuilders don't, which is a focused tone. And imagine ""Focused"" written in huge neon letters. going away from offering you a selection of desert/plains/underground/snow/ect, it keeps a very consistent dark jungle planet theme going. And it does so with remarkable sucsess.On that note, let me talk about the astethics some more. This game is absolutely beautifull, absolutely fantastic actually in that regard. Everything from the enviroment design, to the animations, the armor design, the enemies, the music, the backstory, the music, you name it, is done to perfection. It all comes together like a beautifull symphony where everything works together.It also sports an intersting research mechanic in which you don't magicaly know how to make everything, and do not in fact start out with the blueprints to, or knowlage of how a high powered assault rifle works. Blueprints can be found lying about, or can be accuiered through research. In my opininon, this is a brilliant mechanic, and also adds to the general feel of the game.AI behaviour is alright. They do the standard search around for the player, then charge. There is an interesting mechanic this game has, and that is its light system. Light sources can help lowering an enemys deffence, and make it go down easier. If you have enough of it, it might kill them by you looking at them too hard as well.As a worldbuilder, it is quite alright. Nothing truly remarkable, but the astethics and the interesting mechanics puts it above average. Add to this the way most equipment requires power (this being a hard sci-fi game after all) makes base construction  very interesting. It also does a lot of little things to help you out, for instance: If you are in proximity of a container holding the resources you need, you do not in fact need to pick it up and place it in your inventory, which cuts down on the tedeus micromanagement a lot.On the subject of combat however, the game leaves something to be desired. Most weapons unsattisfyingly ""Pow-Pow"" their way through the enemies, and the animations and effects mannage to fall flat in that regard. I would have loved seeing their light engine at work with something like a muzzleflash.But where the game fails is in it's lack of substance. The enviroments, while beautifull, are quite limited to three actuall surface ones, which are simply progressively difficult, and there isn't enought to discover there. Which is a shame, since this is a worldbuilder where you hardly have to go underground at all. Which i think is a good thing. There are shamefully few weapons. Not realy many varriations. Linearely upgraded swords, and your standard arsenal of conventional weapons. Rifle, pistol, shotgun, grenade launcher... I'd like to see some more choises within thise things. For instance, several different rifles.It also realy lacks substance in it's equipment range. While there are several well designed and absolutely awesome armors, there is a lack of equipment to use with them. Rocket boots, jetpack, rebreather, en setra.But the cardinal sin, is the fact that the game realy, realy feels like it's still in beta, and can be difficult to get running. The menus bug out constantly, and a lot of items lack a description. Having such captations as ""Comming soon"", if any at all.It's also worth mentioning that while the astethics are absolutely fantastic, there is one place it fails, and that's in the enemy sound design.To summarize what has become a nightmareishly long review: The game is absolutely stunning in it's visual design, and it's immersion level is top notch. It has some realy interesting mechanics rarely seen in this genre. It's use of light as more of ""A thing"", the very absorbing base construction, it's use of research all work realy well, and fits perfectly within it's sci-fi setting. The story is intreuging, and the enviroments make you want to explore. It realy -feels- very different from other worldbuilders. So if you're prepaired to overlook it's lack of substance, can handle a small truckload of bugs, and the odd bizzare peice of sound design, then i can recommend this game."

Yes, the digging and finding new stuff definately works on my Minecraft/OCD center. It's very addicting. However, the UI commits some unpardonable errors. Dragging stuff from your inventory to your hotbar will instead dump it on the ground 60% of the time. Trying to close a door can make you drink a health potion instead. Attacking a monster will sometimes open a cabinet, or stick a light on a wall. You shift-right click to pick up some stuff, but other stuff you can just walk over it to pick it up. It's breaking the first rule of UI design - if the player does something, it must be consistent throughout and work as the player expects it to.I also have issues with the procedurally generated worlds not producing good worlds to game in. Something like tar should be available after a little searching. I had to abandon one world and start another because I was stuck without it. Another world, I literally had none of those squid things to kill until I quit and reloaded. Then suddenly they were there. The algorithm needs to put common stuff near you and rarer stuff farther away, and the player should be able to complete the first couple quests more easily, to give him incentive to continue. There is good potential here, and as I said, it's a very addicting game, but I think it needs another 6 months in the oven.-Eddy"

Sometimes my placed torch will seem to provide almost no light in a tunnel. Then I move a few feet away from it and suddenly the tunnel lights up magically?Also, you are going to die. A *lot*. A lot, lot, lot. Most creatures can kill you in a few hits. If you die, you leave your equipped armor behind so you have to go retrieve it.

For example, tar can be turned to sulphur which becomes sulphuric acid when mixed with water. Throw in copper with the acid and u get platinum. Every material is linked in more than 1 way to another and the constant combining/mixing of chemicals and compounds to get others really reinforces the sci-fi theme of this game.The initial going can be tough but if ur willing to invest some time/effort the eventual sense of accomplishment is strong. U go from working with simple copper and stone to eventually anti-matter and motors. Ur wooden shack lit by basic torches and glow jars soon become high-tech labs with fluro lamps powered through an electrical sys u lay urself.The main story is a little clunky and in some cases, broken right now but it doesn't impede the actual progression. That said, data logs are still abound which add backstory and flavor to the atmosphere. The devs seem to be quite active and hands-on with the forums so the game will hopefully improve over time.Overall, if ur a fan of the sandbox/resource-gathering genre and crave a sci-fi take with increased graphical fidelity, give Darkout a shot."

And I've only played it for six hours.So, first off, it does borrow heavily from Minecraft and Terraria as far as the mining-for-resources-to-survive aspect goes.  Same could be said for the crafting mechanics, too.  But the tone of the game is vastly different, much more oppressive, and considerably darker. Exploration is key, both above and below ground, and enemies can continuously spawn in your general vicinity if there is not enough light. No matter how many times you kill them, they will keep spawning right in front of you. This adds to the tension, especially if you are trying your hardest to mine a large vein of ore before returning to base, and you're out of torches.The game also progresses a lot slower than would be expected. Sure, your starting tools don't break after repeated use, but the crafting and research mechanics will slow you down if you can't identify what you need and how you're supposed to get it. This actually held me up for about an hour, where I was furiously looking for stone to smelt for tin ore.  I felt pretty stupid after I realized the solution was right in front of me.I can't really do the game justice with this review, but I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival adventures, resource gathering and building up tech levels."

However it provides a level of production value otherwise unseen in this genre. Despite being an unfinished product it already boasts a high level of polish both in terms of presentation and balance. The dark sci-fi setting delivers a strong sense of lonliness and constant danger and the rate of progression and difficulty seems tuned just right.Darkout isn't going to win any prizes for originality and currently suffers from being a bit too crash happy (a problem mitigated mostly with autosaves), but if you loved Terraria you'll find a lot to love here."

Grungy Sci-fi, well-written plot communicated via discarded data logs and patchy radio transmissions, and sandbox exploration and construction? Absolutely.To be completely honest, there is less in the way of pure progression content than there is in, say, Terraria, and there is currently a bug that can prevent progression through the main quest. That said, the price is still justified in my mind as there is still plenty enough to do even though you can run into a show-stopper for the main quest, that doesn't really block your character's progression, which is what sandbox games are really all about, right?The dev team is also quite dedicated; a control bug I reported on the forums received dev responses shortly after and was fixed two days later. It was an easy-to-fix problem, granted, but it was definitely nice to see that sort of response to the community.I would highly recommend Darkout to anyone who enjoys sandbox games and/or sci-fi. And I can only really see the experience improving as the game becomes more polished and possibly has content added to it."

Having said that, there's something incredibly addictive/fun about this game. I'm more of an RTS/Strategy and RPG type person but this ""little"" game sucked me right in. You start out with your bare hands, a few tools and an earnest desire to put some walls between you and the creatures that are hunting you!Explore: there's always something new around the corner, under your feet or maybe even above you.Research: Make and research your own weapons, armor and technology. Go from a fire lit cave to a fusion powered palace!Build: Build your own base. Will it be a simple shack or a fortress of solitude? As you unlock new technologies there's always just one more thing to add..Fight: Will you be the Hunter or the Hunted? As you get stronger so do your enemies.

,Recommended,257050,12504468,"Posted: 15 October, 2014",all,Rawsome83,"A beautiful little gem of a game, with an interesting twist to it. Not exactly Terraria to be quite honest. If only it had come out earlier instead, and gotten some love early on. As it stands now, the game is pretty damn polished and done as a base game. It needs more content though.The crafting is very interesting and has a lot of depth to it. There's a real potential of making very interesting bases with electricity, generators, battery storage and the whole lot.. Only sad part is that it's not really that heavily focused upon. You can spend a lot of time progressing without even touching upon the tech that is available. Eventually and enevitably it will catch up to you though.Interesting merge of self tought tech along with recipes you have to find out there. A story that could have gotten somewhere, if it wasn't for the unfortunate mechanic of how it progresses. There's a few tweaks and bugs in the story that needs to be ironed out, as it's terribly immersion breaking as it is right now.There is a grind to the game (naturally), but nothing you can't handle or expect from a game of this genre. Like I pointed out earlier, there are some flaws to the way you progress in the story though.. Making it somewhat of a burden to have to soldier through..But all in all I have to say I really like this game. A lot! I only wish it had more content to it. More story and a way to travel to other planets perhaps, or other planes. The maps are either small, medium or large, but even then.. they are only so big. Once you've explored it all, it's done. There's a saving grace in that you can use the same character with progression attached to it, on other worlds you create though. As a fresh start in a sense, but separated from your previous world.I really recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Terraria, Crea, Minecraft or any other game where you build, explore and and progress at your own pace. It's a beautiful and very underrated title that deserves much more attention than it's currently getting. Hopefully there's more content to come for this title!Easily a 10/10 from me"

76561198044911792,Recommended,257050,16763414,"Posted: 28 June, 2015",all,Eveaustria,"(updated March 2016) You might not want to believe it, but I still recommend this game.Yes, Darkout is a bit unfinished storywise (not much though), also several targets of the roadmap (including regular patches/expansions) have not been reached. Since the developers have fallen silent after April/May 2015 and it seems like the main dev allegedly got a job elsewhere ,you can safely assume that this version of Darkout is most likely the final one with no further updates.BUT this game is still very well worth its current price (12 Euro).How many games (like adventures) are just ""done"" at one point without being patched any longer, and how many games have ""open"" ends like showing how the end-boss re-emerges indicating a continuation that often never is delivered? So what? Does this make games any less enjoyable?If I hadn't played this game I definitely would have missed out on something inspiring :) So if you like games like Terraria, Starbound, Crea, Signs of Life and the like, and you have a little extra money to spend then give Darkout a try one day - it's a fresh take on the 2D-sandbox genre.The pros:The gameplay of Darkout is interesting nonetheless, the game looks and sounds beautiful, it has nice features, an atmospheric gameworld to explore and a lot of stuff that can be crafted & built. On my PC with Windows 7 prof. the game runs smoothly with nearly no bugs.The speciality of Darkout is to light up the world while aiming for your goal (collect audio logs to find out what has happened and then defeat the boss-mobs). As dangerous creatures are all emerging from clouds of darkness you will have to protect yourself, your base and your paths by placing durable light sources all over the game-world. Torches will burn out though and lighting will be attacked by creatures, so placing durable lanterns or even setting up long electricity grids is highly recommended if you plan to play this game for a longer while.You will have to create pathways between the many islands floating in the sky and you will also have to dig downwards to reach deeper layers of the world and caves full of crystals that you'll want for crafting more advanced equipment and useful stuff for your base and transportation. You can build teleporters later on (sadly the ""sledges"" do not really work so well, and the elevators are a bit uncomfortable to use because you can easily drop to your death if you miss your step and do not build a safety-ladder next to the elevator-shaft ).If you are an ""achiever""-type of player and/or a ""builder""-type, you could set yourself the personal game-goal of unlocking all existing crafting-recipes and/or of building a giant (lit) base in whatever creative shape (there's a ""builder""-mode too) and you will enjoy this game a lot. The surviving-, building- and crafting-features are well done with many things you can make and/or strive for, and these main features do not seem ""unfinished"" (or ""clunky"") in any way.The cons:- ""story"" and ""quests""... this game DOES have a ""story"", but it's unrefined and unfinished. Unfortunately only the first ""quests"" within this storyline will ask you to build (rather ""place"") stuff. All the other ""tasks"" will just make you wait for data-logs to spawn in a specific biome (UPDATE: or go hunting for evil creatures in this biome) and then search for these logs - one after another, and again and again. Well, listening to them is not so bad because of the rather nice voice-acting- many crafting-recipes also depend on receiving such data-containers purely by chance  (UPDATE: the chances that these will drop as a loot from creatures that you kill have seemingly been raised and you don't get ""corrupted"" ones any longer, but a message instead that no new data-logs are available currently until later on, so this is much better now)- the starting ""tutorial"" consists of a bunch of tiring text-windows filled with small letters that you'll just want to click away, instead of being a quest-like ""training"" for your character- the game does not feature an multiplayer-option even though this was originally in the pipeline- more types of discoveries, creatures, biomes, drops and resources would have been nice, because the variety is lacking a bit and get a bit boring after playing for a while- renewable ressources are lacking too - growing plants like trees yourself purposefully is not possible for example, and botanical materials are not used much anyways (plus your character does not need to eat nor sleep), and there's no mapping feature. However there are a lot of additional trees growing on the islands in the sky, and you can extract the most common ores from bits of stone and earth that you will collect when digging- the development of Darkout has suffered from financial problems (like when Desura went bankrupt and did not pay developers or when Darkout was in highest demand during summer sales for very little money) for quite a while. However also some not-so-good decisions have been made along the way, like presenting the prospect of ""upcoming"" features like multiplayer and promising frequent updates time and again. It would have been better to just keep silent...After this statement was published one year agohttp://www.darkoutgame.com/2015/04/30/update-on-developments/a♥♥♥♥♥♥storm followed, and then Allgraf Studioshttps://www.facebook.com/AllgrafStudios/has seemingly gone into hiding.Ever since then no news about the planned spin-off Darklings or anything else have ever been heard. It's very likely that this new game has been nipped in the bud because of the same lack of funds that Darkout and it's scheduled expansions/updates had suffered from, but perhaps also from all the badmouthing and even personal insults that people have thrown at the developer/s.Like other players who enjoyed Darkout I still somehow harbour hopes that even though the developer most likely will never want to take up working on this nice game any longer, at least the game's source code might become open source - or perhaps might be handed over to someone who would like to fix some bugs and create a proper story-ending. Well, a complete overhaul of the quest-system starting with the tutorial and adding some substantial content to this quest-line as well as more creatures and - renewable, useful - flora to spice up the game would definitely be even better of course ;)"

Many things about the game look stunning. (from the details of you're character, enemy creatures, neutral creatures, environment and backgrounds.

The lack of multiplayer is annoying, this game would be great if it had a multiplayer feature to it.

The visuals were the most effective and pleasant blend between light and dark I've seen since the super-classic Heart of Darkness. When I first played it, however, I was shocked at how dull and unresponsive the game truly was. Now, I'll let the devs off with a warning and a slap on the wrist for it THIS TIME, since this is (s'far as I can tell) their first title and all, and of course that it's brand spankin' new, but the fact that you can't change the controls DRASTICALLY lowers my ability to appreciate it. Then there's the unforgiving gameplay, which I can't really say is altogether BAD, but this time around it's not good either. I've played games like DayZ, RUST, Demon Souls AND Dark Souls, and all 'cept the first one, I've appreciated how unforgivingly ruthless they all are. When you die, you focking DIE, bïtch! You don't just get to restart from a checkpoint or reload your latest quicksave from 2-3 minutes earlier. No focking way, dude. When you die in those games, you suffer. A lot.That's not the case with Darkout, however. When you die in this game, you don't lose anything. At all. Oh, unless of course you count the time it'll take you to get to wherever you were and keep doing your shït over there. But the grim fact in this case is that losing anything from dying isn't what's so appallingly frightening about death in Darkout. It's the fact that when you respawn, you'll end up in the exact same spot as before, and if (Bunne forbid) you died where you respawn with no ammo on your person or with an enemy lurking about (which WILL be case if you died there, you unfortunate bästard you), then you're focked. Hard. In the äss. With a baseball bat.Unless you do things right on the first in-game day with about 5% margin of error, chances are extremely high that you've focked yourself over REAL BAD, hombre. You start the game with a pistol that fires GLOWING CYAN BULLETS! Pretty sweet, right? Wrong. 'Cause guess what? Yup, that's right! You don't have infinite ammo. Because that's for püssies and Bruce Willis, depending on if it's in a game or an action movie, respectively. And it gets worse. You start out with only 35 bullets. The most basic enemies require 1 hit to kill 'em. But that's 1 HIT. Miss, and you've wasted a shot. Then, when night comes, you'll be getting focked over by some kinda headcrab-esque ""parasites"", which unless you aim perfectly at 'em, takes at least 3 rounds to kill. AND, it gets worse... you'll need to do a LOT of gathering, harvesting, researching, crafting and other böllocks to even be able to get any kind of effective weaponry to defend yourself with.I've never been one to turn down a fair challenge, but this? Nah. This game ain't fair or challenging. It's frustratingly poorly designed, and there's very little about it that makes it worth buying, let alone playing. HOPEFULLY, we'll see some patches (and they better focking come SOON as well!) and it'll all be fine 'n' dandy, but until then, I'm afraid this game just BARELY manages to score an average rating with me. 5.6/10"

Darkout bring not only gorgeous graphics but a more immersive feel to it... more then just day and night cycles but more challenging mobs that at times put a tinge of fear into you if your unprepared for the encounters....It seems alot easier to DIE in this game then the others  Ive played the other ""spritey"" games and they all feel the same Darkout is alot more of what Im personally looking for....This game will be insane when multiplayer hitsas Im looking forward to the comming stages =)"

76561198030741785,Recommended,257050,9198926,"Posted: 20 February, 2014",all,SouthofHeaven,I am new to this genre. I just bought Starbound recently and enjoyed it so far. This game is similar but has its own vibe. I found the aesthetics and combat on this game more pleasing than Starbound. Until multiplayer is figured in it is hard to really grade this product for those that are looking to buy one or the other. As a single player experience it is very entertaining and now is the time to get in on the action. Even though it is in an early stage it will pay for itself. If I compared it to other early access titles it would get high grades because it is very playable and fun. Thumbs way up!

But just taking the money from early access and not finishing the game but leaving the rest as DLC for people to buy when they already brought your game... its unforgivable"

Then, the devs abandoned the project and disappeared completely.So, what do you get from Darkout as it stands?!A multi-player game with no multi-player support, a dangling plot line that is only about 1/4 complete, a crafting tree that is not well thought out and a game that gives a promise with no happy ending, actually no ending at all except deleting it and never playing it again.If those appeal to you, then buy the game.  Otherwise there are plenty of new games on the market to spend your time on.So, for me lesson learned.  I got burnt on this game and Starforge.  Now I won't buy alpha, beta, early access or any type of pre-release software.  I recommend everyone does the same.Does it look good?! Sure.  Can you get some play time out of it?!  Sure.  That said, other than the typical grind required to tool up, there is about 4 to 5 hours of real content to this game and that is it.  Then, you are stuck wanting more, more that will never come."

I think it will be great in time, but it isn't there yet.  That said it is pretty fun to play, and easy to play a couple hundred hours.  Which makes it worth the price you pay for it IMO.  The most frustrating thing about this game is that it doesn't seem to have the audience to support a good wiki yet, so many of the answers that you are looking for aren't available.Updated to do not recommend.   Sad this was a good concept but the devs aren't behind it, have moved on to other things something."

Once I got everything I could researched and pretty much explored everywhere, I waited for the rest of the game to be finished.... It won't be, from what I hear. If you get it cheaper than Terraria it might give you a few hours or so of fun and exploration. But my ultimate recommendation:Get Terraria (or another time-tested sandbox game.)"
