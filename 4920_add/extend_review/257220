Even a dumb♥♥♥♥♥like me can complete this one within a reasonable time-frame. (Okay, maybe I had to Google a walkthrough once or twice, but ONLY once or twice.)If you're in the market for a short but well-told tale with a few slightly creepy (though never quite full-blown ""scary"") bits, you can't do much better than getting this when it's on sale...though the current asking price of ten bucks is perhaps a bit steep for well under five hours of gameplay.Beware the Asanbosam!Verdict: 7.5/10."
76561198045208825,Recommended,257220,12828468,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,Shatiz,"TLDR: A very short point-and-click puzzle game with a forgettable main character and story. Get it cheap and don’t expect too much and you’ll have a decent time with it.Long story: Sam Peters was one of the side-characters in Secret Files 2. Here she is again in her own little adventure, starting from where we left her in the previous game. In Secret Files 2 I found her much nicer than the main characters; though mainly because her voice-actress was not completely incompetent. So, is she an interesting enough character to fill out an adventure on her own? Not really. She’s an excellent example of a writer trying to create a “strong female character” without having any clue how. As a result most of her jokes center around her ex-boyfriend’s dangly parts. The story is similarly uninteresting; you are trying to track down a professor in the jungle and when you get there everyone is missing! So, nothing new, but it works.The puzzle design has the same “charms” and problems as the previous Secret Files games: a ton of items that you are supposed to use, but often a very vague goal that you are trying to accomplish, forcing you to try everything on everything. I found it a bit less annoying in Sam Peters than I did in Secret Files 2; but that’s probably because that was a much longer game which naturally increases the number of times you get annoyed at seemingly unintuitive solutions.The length of the game (I finished it in about 2h) is a real problem, at least according to other reviews. Personally I think it was the right decision for the game. After all, the main character and the story could probably not support a much longer game. In fact, dragging it out longer would probably have ended up hurting the game more. Still, it means you have to decide what you are willing to pay for such a short adventure game with a rather bland and uninteresting heroine and story. I got it at 75% off at around 2.5 Euro and that was okay for me. Set your expectations low and you may have a good time with Sam Peters."

Not an extensive review, just a pro/con summary:Pro:- logical puzzles- atmospheric scenery- decent voice actingCon:- rather short with an abrupt ending- main character isn't really likeable- character animations aren't really '2013', for every action it's using the same general 'do something' animation"

In other genres you would call it a DLC. Was a good deal in the steam Autumn sale."

,Recommended,257220,7557656,"Posted: 3 November, 2013",all,Bastwood,"An offshoot in the Secret Files series with a minor character from part two, Puritas Cordis, getting her own little adventure in the jungles of Africa. While being very short compared to the rest of the games in the series, this one is actually the first one that's on par with the original - that is, perfectly acceptable, albeit not especially great adventure on a budget.Sam Peters is a better protagonist than Nina Kalenkov, even though she does still blurt out wildly inappropriate stuff every once in a while and definitely has a bit of a snooty attitude. Anyhow, the story is more in line with Animation Arts' best effort, Lost Horizon: A traditional Indiana Jones -style romp that deals with uncovering existing mysteries of the world instead of inventing new ones or trying to provide a modern angle on things.The graphics have improved a bit, the voice acting is perfectly serviceable and the puzzle design is actually quite nice. I never got desperately stuck, so I guess this is one of the easier entries in the series. You can definitely see the budget trappings of the game though - Almost no other characters besides Sam, exposition done mostly with static comic book -style panels and text, pretty lukewarm ending etc. etc. Still, I'd say this is not a waste considering the price, and will aggravate the player much less than some of the other Secret Files entries."
,Recommended,257220,8610475,"Posted: 7 January, 2014",all,Saga,"Hmm...a difficult game to recommend because it's incredibly short (took me two hours) with little in the way of replay value (obviously, given it's a point n' click) and a fairly blande and uninteresting story,BUT the puzzles are solid, the game looks pretty good and it's SIGNIFICANTLY better than the main Secret Files games which are a complete mess so if you can grab it fairly cheap then it's a perfectly adequate couple of hours of adventure gaming.I give it three Ark of the Covenants out of OHGODMYFACEISMELTING"

I found it too tedious and short for my likings. It seemed it was over just as the plot started to get slightly better."

Solid voice-acting, pretty locations, nice puzzles. True, Sam's character isn't as sympathetic as Nina and the game's quite short but it's worth checking out. Wait for the next sale and get it cheaper."

Short.The game is fun to play but it's certainly very short. The puzzles can be solved without any hints and are for the most part pretty fun. The character can walk or run, you can cancel an action you didn't intend to make, and you can skip cutscenes if you'd like. However, the whole game will likely take an hour or two and that's it. So if you get it on sale, it might be worth it, but the $9.99 pricetag seems excessive."

76561198024179463,Not Recommended,257220,13861642,"Posted: 6 January, 2015",all,kokmaister,"I like Secret Files series. Sure, all of them have some not so perfect moments, but those just have still always had that something, that have grabbed me and made me play them thru with an enjoyment. That's the reason I was pretty glad to hear, that they've made a smaller spin-off from the series, and Sam Peters as a character even makes sense for a spin-off.But man, this one isn't nowhere near as enjoyable game as the installments in the main series (story, puzzles, production values etc. etc.). Unless you're a die-hard Secret Files fan and really itching for more, anything from Secret Files world, sure, grab this one. But, if you're not, even, if you've enjoyed the main series, think twice. I unfortunately can't recommend this without reservations, not even for all the Secret Files fans. It's a shame, that they made this game as the Animation Arts have gone better and better over the time. Especially Lost Horizon is a magnificent adventure game. This makes me hope, that the majority of the team have been so concentrated into the rumored Lost Horizon 2 and that's the reason for the quality of this one."

As a long time fan (who was bitterly disappointed by SF3) I'd definitely buy it again at that price. The story is interesting and (somewhat) ties in with Secret Files 2. It lacks the multi-character feature that Secret Files is famous for and the protagonist, Sam Peters, who we know from SF2, always goes on about her ex boyfriend and makes really boring jokes about how lame she thinks men are, or at least that's the case in the German language version. I simply ignored that. If you miss Secret Files and don't mind that the game is very short, then maybe you should try it - it's the series last hurrah."

I suppose that I'd play 10 hours instead of 3-4 hours just because of a damn labyrinth.  Becoming a 10 hours game just because of a damn labyrinth doesn't increase the content.I'm a bit sad that I just finished the Secret Files marathon I wanted to do for years, and it stopped suddenly.The other chapters have way much more content.
