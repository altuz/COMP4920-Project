I gotta say it's been a long time that I actually had to draw maps just to get through most of the game and it has some really great puzzles in it. I recommend for everyone because this is fantastic, the ending isn't really a strong point but the adventure makes up for it"

Confused.If you fall into that first category, this might be a game for you (as a self-professed fandom member, I don't think I can help but be a little biased). If you fall into the second category, you might want to think more carefully. Either way, I can't wholeheartedly recommend this game (although I would love to), but can only advise that you think very carefully. I'll try to explain all that, and I'll try to be as thorough as I can in this review, because information on this game is very scarce online.The story is pretty simple, although it tries to have some depth. Everyone is a walking, talking animal (they actually try to explain this, but it's all left very intentionally vague and mysterious. You should have no trouble picking up what it's getting at). The citizens possess a magical orb that allows them to predict the weather, and without it things will get pretty chaotic. You play as Rif, a fox who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time; that is to say, the orb is stolen, and everyone blames you. Because all foxes are thieves, apparently. Rif's girlfriend is kidnapped and he's given a limited amount of time to recover the orb and prove his innocence. Otherwise, bad things will happen. You're accompanied by an Elk and a Boar from two respective tribes, and thus your quest begins. You'll meet some interesting characters and some are actually pretty cool, if underdeveloped. The game's too short to really give any character besides Rif a lot of time to shine, but the developers made the characters fun and lively. Some of the problems with the script result from issues within the developing company. Apparently they wanted to make a rather mature game, with themes and issues and characters adults could enjoy; traces of this shine through. In one conversation I had, a character made some veiled innuendos and (very tame) sexual advances (the kind of thing no child would ever pick up on). And although the developers were pushing for a mature game, the publishers saw animals and immediately assumed it was a game for kids. The script was toned down and scenes were cut, as were all scenes involving death. The result of this dispute is a little sloppy. The story never quite lives up to its potential and everything feels just a little too cheery. It turns what could have been a decent adventure into something much more suitable for children. That's not to say an adult couldn't enjoy it; it just isn't what it could have been.Inherit the Earth is a point-and-click adventure game. If you don't like those, you're going to hate this. You're not going to be fighting enemies, platforming, shooting, racing, looting, or grinding. You're going to be walking around, picking things up, and taking them other places. You might have to use one item on something to open a new path. It's that kind of game.It's biggest flaw is that it isn't very deep. The characters are fun and the graphics are very nice (more on that later), but there isn't too much to the gameplay. Myst and its sequels are some of my favorite games, and their draw is incredibly difficult puzzle solving. Those games are the pinnacle of the point-and-click genre. Inherit the Earth, on the other hand, does not have any real puzzles. It doesn't have much that could confuse or stump you. There were only a handful of moments where I wasn't sure what to do. That may be because I'm a seasoned adventure gamer -- I'm not sure. It would definitely give a younger player a bigger challenge.Music... Eh. You're not going to like it. There's very little music here, aside from fifteen second loops that go on and on and on... But I can't fault them. Some of the little loops are a little catchy and, hey, they add to the game's charm if nothing else. The sound effects all sound fine, and the game's fully voice acted. The actors don't do a bad job, but they're not going to be winning any awards for their performances either. But I do applaud the decision to add voice acting. In a game like this, where the story and gameplay are both rather thin, the cast of characters is going to be one of the bigger selling points, and I couldn't help but be won over by these characters. Rif in particular was a joy to play, and the little, sometimes stupid things he would say as I guided him around made him altogether very likeable. Every character was like that, to their own degree. The world really felt alive with its characters; it was even hard not to like the bad characters. And for that, I say the voice acting is a major plus.The graphics are one of the game's biggest selling points. They're not phenomenal or anything. On today's computers they look pixelated at best, but somehow they still look excellent. Unfortunately, the camera angle is almost always zoomed in extraordinarily closely. It made even the nicest of environments hard to see sometimes, and sometimes made the game harder to play. However, when entering new rooms or areas, the developers occasionally opted to display the new room/area in a smaller window overlapping the first one. It was a neat effect, and while it didn't add much to the gameplay, it aided the overall look of the game, which I found myself liking more and more as I played. The animations are, for the most part, clean and well executed, and the sprites large and detailed. Everything is vibrant and drawn in a wonderful art style and helps sell this game's charm.And that's really what this game has going for it -- charm. It's not the most terrifically fun game to play, and the story isn't really going to make you think. But the world itself is lovely and the characters entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent playing this game (which took me 5 hours to beat), and I think you will too, if you're looking for something that will make you smile or feel like a kid again.When all's said and done, this game is probably better suited to kids, and when I have children of my own I'll look forward to the day I can sit down and play this with them.As I said earlier, I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. It's flawed, yes, very much so, but it does have some wonderful things in its favor. Furries and adventure gamers might find more to enjoy here than the average player, but it's simple and breezy enough to make anybody smile. There's a lot that isn't working, but if you can look past all that, you'll find a very charming game with a lot of heart."

But if you love adventure games, this shouldn't bother you. This is a real overlooked classic of the genre.Nice graphics, nice music, good voice acting, and it runs natively on modern machines. It does not use DOSBox or ScummVM. They actually ported this to modern systems.The only negative thing I have to say about this game, is that it ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger. Hoping for a sequel! I think it's in the works currently, with Patreon support.Bottom line: A solid retro adventure game with a huge nostalgia factor."

Still managed to entertain me during my playthrough- Resolution might have been a tad higher (know this is an old ported game, but the map screen and some of the scenery just look so much more detailed then the characters)- Pretty short, most time goes in to searching for items and navigating mazes, still finished in 6 hours, but still feels like complete story- Some minor scenes could have been a bit longer: saving the cat warrior and the feast after could have been a bit longer and the end felt a bit abrupt. Still it all felt convincing from start till end and never broke a fourth wall or feel out of place.- Some minor crashes, please save often, some of the shores become really tedious when you have to do them again."

,Recommended,257260,29980037,Posted: 17 February,all,Two Tailed Warrior,"Inherit the Earth is an old 90's click adventure set in a world where anthromorphic animals inhabit the land and the humans mysteriously disappeared. You play as Rif of the Fox Tribe to help him clear his name and save his girlfriend.Positives:The game is pretty forgiving for new comersGood plotEasy controls to pick up quickly (though, you would hope so with a click-adventure)Good atmosphereQuite EnjoyableLittle jokes and comments that you just have to smile at (even if it's just a little)Negatives:You can skip triggers for certain events which can leave you gaps in the plot (in the third section I was being too sneaky and missed a trigger event. Thankfully, my last save was right where I needed to be in order to get it right.)Small question about the plot in the beginningI mean, come on. You can't just look at someone and just say, ""What if he's guilty? You are under arrest by our king because our rivals accused you!""Also, the ending did not fully satisfy me personally.I actually got so into exploring the human's ruins, that I forgot I was there for the orb of storms and was surprised to realize the bed in the underwater room at the dam was recently used. Seriously, though, I want to know just why the humans are gone.Overall, it is quite an enjoyable game, especially if you're into fantasy or anthromorphic animals. However, if you are to guide the fox, you must think like the fox. Be clever, and you might just complete your quest. What am I saying? We have full faith in you!What are you standing there for? That orb ain't gonna find itself!"
76561198004369747,Recommended,257260,19342252,"Posted: 28 November, 2015",all,Lo Wang,"I liked the game.  Though, I feel like it was such a small piece of the pie, because it ends off at a cliff hanger where very little is resolved and we don't discover what happened in the lore.  There's apparently a web comic that finishes everything.In terms of game design, the beginning suffers from a few old-school problems (fetch quests with repeating mazes).  However, after a certain point, it starts feeling a bit more like a good adventure game, like King's Quest or Monkey Island.  The lore and story get more interesting, as well, as you get a sense of the bigger picture.  Lore is one of the game's more emphasized points, and puzzles are fairly light.  I feel that the lore spoke a lot louder than the actual narrative, and I found myself reacting more to what I would see in the backgrounds on the journey, rather than what was happening in the moment.  I felt it was intentional, as there is a recurring theme of solving puzzles throughout the narrative, and maybe the lore is meant to be that puzzle.  The narrative itself is average for a video game.  You are on a quest and go through puzzles to complete it.  Pretty much like any of the KQ games.If you find the beginning a bit boring or tedious, try and stick it out, because it will get better (more puzzles and less mazes).  I felt like the characters became more interesting as well, after that turning point.  I adored the dog prince, rather than the boar king, despite them both sharing the same kind of role.  The wild cat tribe was very interesting and refreshing, in comparison to the prior tribes I met.  I also liked Shiala, who seemed to have a good bit of character to her.  She seemed more genuine and three dimensional, as well.  Most of these characters show up later.  The voices are fairly decent, considering how old it is.  I think the art assets are fairly good, although not quite as beautiful as the later KQ art.  In terms of difficulty, this is one of the easier adventure games I've played, with, for reference, Dragonsphere being on the harder end.I liked it, and think it's worth a play through.  If you're really stringent on your adventure games, you could probably pass this one.  But if you like most adventure games, this one is worth getting."

Play it if you love animal characters or you read the webcomic."

A rich story is interwoven with light humor and puzzles that are not too dificult yet feel rewarding to complete.The only weakness of the game are the maze puzzles, which require you to draw up a map while navigating throughout a  given maze of corridors. While this is not an uncommon feature to use in the early 90's adventure and rpg games, these puzzles serve to extend the playtime rather than enjoyment."
,Recommended,257260,14691825,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,raf!,"Classic point-and-click adventure game with everything you'd expect from a game made in the mid-90s: puzzles, nice sense of humour, talking animals (for the child that lives in you... or furry fellas in general!) and, what is in my opinion one of the best features of this game, fantastic voice acting. The game looks and feels like something out of a Disney movie, presenting a sweet cute storyline with charming characters from the very first scene.As a 90s point-and-click game, expect lots of exploration and puzzle-solving that will require good amounts of trial and error - or just a keen eye. There's definitely no hand-holding, so don't be afraid to pick up a piece of paper and draw a map of the dungeons, if you need, or refer to the web as a last resort.The only negative aspects of the game are the length and lack of replay value, since there's not much outside the main storyline and once you get to the end your next playthrough will take minutes. Also, the game was planned to have a sequel that never came, but the authors stayed true to their work and published a webcomic, which you can read for free on the internet. The comic sheds a different light on some events of the game and adds a plethora of new characters and adventures. The art is definitely not a strong point, but the world of Inherit the Earth is just too sweet and interesting, so I keep coming back to that comic. It's worth mentioning that the comic is still being published as I write this review!All in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the 90s feeling of point-and-click adventures and is looking for a  laidback experience."

I love old adventure games and went in knowing that it's not going to be a Lucasarts classic, but still hoping for a good time. Nope. It's full of terrible cliches, bad writing, bad voice acting, and of the 6 hours it took me to complete the game, probably around 5 of those were spent in mazes. I feel like all those mazes were a cop-out for putting actual content in the game (there was very little of that). They added nothing but sheer frustration to the gameplay experience. Plus, some of the areas you have to revisit several times which means you have to navigate those mazes EVERY TIME. What a waste of time and energy.
