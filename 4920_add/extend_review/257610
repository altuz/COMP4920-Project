,Not Recommended,257610,11280647,"Posted: 16 July, 2014",all,MissBunny,"This program is useful for grabbing some nice quality vector graphics for logo design. However the interface is a bit clunky, there aren't a lot of options such as formatting text  to be centered aligned? How'd they miss that one? There's a lot of functionality issuses that need to be addressed in this program before I'd recommend purchasing it. However, if you're looking for a library of graphics that are relevant to graphic design, then this clipart library would be perfect. I'm sure if I shifted through this program a bit more, there's probably a lot of little gems that would make this more worth using, but for your basic 2D graphic design, this didn't do much for me. 4/10"

If you delete a point it turns the surrounding points to corners and there's no way to turn them back. Dragging a point doesn't drag it's arm doohickeys with it, so it turns into a different shape. It doesn't shut down properly, so it looks like I've used it for a ton of hours, and steam can't be restarted when it updates unless you kill the logomaker.exe process. I can't imagine what situation this would actually be a good fit for, unless all you really wanted was a clipart cd."

76561198050707075,Recommended,257610,14670061,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,ZED ™,"I really do recommend this software but only for those who are just stepping into the business. Its a good start if you dont know how to use Photoshop or Illustrator. This software can give beginners a jump start and may improve their way to combining shapes, way to think and etc. It has a library which has lots of various artworks, templates and shapes that you can at least create an idea on your mind and redesign it in Illustrator or P.Shop.The only thing that i didnt like about this software is, it has no option to export your work in "".eps"" or in any kind of vector format. Yes, its obviosly you can not export as such because as you can guess its pixel based. You can only export in common formats like JPEG, BMP, PNG, TIFF, GIF, PDF and SWF.I hope STUDIO V5 would consider to improve this software in the future and bring a solution for users to work in a vector based space.For short,This software has lot to give and it is promising but needs a bit more improving.Yes it is a worthy software for this amount of price. But if you are lack of imagination and creativity, even a million dollar software cant save you.Regards."

However, it's actually quite difficult to use.  For example, I'd like to include a book in the logo I'm making.  There are a few in the clipart objects, but how am I supposed to locate them?  I can't search by text or tags, and the groupings don't really make sense-- e.g., one of the book icons shows up in the 'Human' group.  I'm not sure where the others are grouped, but I found them in 'all objects.'Altogether I don't think this will be very useful for making a professional logo, but I can see it being useful for people who just need a quick and easy solution for adding clipart--maybe teachers putting together something for their classroom, or making flyers to advertise something.  I can also see young kids having fun with it.  It reminds me a bit of a program called Printshop that came loaded on my very first PC back in the early 90s.For making logos on the cheap, however, I'd recommendlogogarden.com, which will also let you download a vector version for less than $10.  As other commenters have already mentioned, vector is a necessity for professional quality, scalable logos."

The shape creation tool is very basic and fiddly though, I have found it much easier to create images in other programmes and then import them into the software to add to the logo. I bought it in the half off sale so really good for kids or professionals looking to knock up a few nice looking logos. If you're a graphic designer, wanting to do more than just some logos or expecting the depth of photoshop however you'd be better looking elsewhere!"
,Recommended,257610,23368342,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,maplesyrupghost,"Actually, not bad.  It's not going to be your primary tool for logo design, but if you can catch it on sale and you are interested in graphic design or do it as a trade, you will find this very handy to have in your arsenal of software.I really like how easy it is to manipulate objects.  It's like photoshop, but more watered down to just let you fast-track your logo, offering a lot of helpful tricks to get something set up.  Sure it could use more features and tools, but what is here works suprisingly well.  It claims to have more than 3300 templates, but in reality it's only 3292.  Where are the others?? Just kidding.  It's worth it just to have these templates to look through to give you an idea of what you want to do.  Pick a template and you can start tweaking it or use it as a base to build off of.I haven't spent a long time in the program but I was shocked at how useful it seems to be, from the perspective of someone who exclusively uses Photoshop on a daily basis.  It won't replace it, but it's a neat little prototyping tool."

Much of what they claim just is NOT true.Let me say I own and use many different photo, graphic, and illistration software like Photoshop, Lightroom, Art Rage, etc, and I purchase this software beacuse of what I could do so quickly and easily.Some reviews claimed you couldn't import your own images...NOT TRUE. YOU CAN!You can use your own art and images. You can adjust color, size of images. There are 10,000 images included that you can use, edit and include in your logo, as well as thousands of templates. It's easy to use, but has a lot of options.I really like the 3D text option and use this a lot for both graphic and video uses.You can set the size, resolution, as well as background type for your image including transparent backgrounds.You can export in all the popular image formats including Animated Flash for animated logos which can be created with this software.I've created some amazing logos and images with this software and it wasn't hard. So those who say otherwise have just not spent the time learning what it can really do or are just out to leave bad feedback."

I mainly got this program for the 3D text feature due to not having PhotoShop. It is very nice and I am enjoying it. It does take a bit of learning for all the features but it isn't that hard and you pick it up quite quick.It's fun just playing with the animated things, I wish they had an option to animate your text (if they do I've not found it sorry if this is true).Just hours of playing around with the stuff within this software is grand, if you can get this on 70% off or more do it, you'll not regret it. I used it to make an outro for youtube and I love the way it looks. Did some animated bits. If you find an image outside online that has a transparent background it'll allow that BG and you can do lots of fun with the icons from the web.Still playing with this but as I said I'm enjoying this."

Would i recommend this to my friends? Yes and no for various reasons.Pros: Thousands of art clips and make your creative more easier. Quick and easy work. Does not required lot of knowledge to work with it. Price is cheap and reasonable.Cons: Resolution is okay but not high quality professional looking logo. No .psd or .ai export file. Some bugs going on in color selection area.For professional looking logo, i would recommend the high end software like illustrator and photoshop.

It has capabilities that you can only find in expensive photo and graphic editors, however, like any other software it is a tool. It is not the end all be all for graphic design or logo creation. While it does have great editing options and an expansive gallery of basic and complex shapes and cliparts it is still just a tool. Your success with this program will depend largely on your artistic vision, and ability to cross platform/software edit graphics. Do not buy if you expect it to jsut sit there and grow money. Definitely buy if you are looking for an inexpensive tool to expand your limited budget studio."
