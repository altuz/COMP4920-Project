And hey, it could have been a decent $0.19 game, it controls smoothly enough and the music's pretty good...Except for one problem. There’s a timing bug, striking about once every ten runs, which will cause you to simply die for no reason. Many people have complained, and video evidence of the bug has been recorded. The developer is well aware of it. But the developer will not fix it, saying that it is too hard to fix and that the game is done. In a game that touts itself as a hardcore precision shooter, and especially one so simple and featureless, I think a random death bug is unacceptable.Also, the last 25% of achievements are extremely long and grindy, and will repeatedly pit you against the random death bug if you try to aim for them.Recommend avoiding this one."

For starters there's no possibility for progression, You just end starting at the beginning and going through exactly the same level up to when the skulls appear and soon after that you die and have to start again, your stuck in that same brief never ending cycle. The scoring is a joke because you just can't get a good score and give yourself something to beat either. I grew up on games such as Space invaders. Defender, Galaxian and Phoenix and I'm always on the lookout for similar games today, Sadly this is not one of them.They put the emphasis on your accumulated high score yet I can't find a way to actually see what that my total score is?"

Pity me, for I paid for this crap.Blast Em! is a cheap little shoot em up that is all about surviving for as long as you can. Chances are, you won't be staying alive for long.StoryThere really isn't one for this game. The Steam store page mentions something about defending the universe from evil alien robots, but there is nothing resembling a story once you start the game. Make up whatever excuse you like for why your pilot is flying his ship.PresentationVisuals are very basic. You have your ship, some different enemies, their bright red attacks, asteroids, coins and powerups. Resembles something you might have seen on the old Commodore 64 or Amiga home computers.On to the sound. For the most part, the music is bloody awful. When starting the game, a track will be picked and played until you quit. Go into the options and mute it the moment you start the game. The sound effects are pretty poor. A constant sound effect for your own firing, another for enemy firing, crap explosion sounds for deaths of either you or them, and a few low quality words for when you start the level, die or grab one of the power ups.ControlsMouse only. Don't both  if you don't have a decent mouse. Everything is done by moving the mouse, and clicking the left button if you are on the menu. No keyboard or gamepad controls for this game, not even an option for them.GameplayVery simple. Move your mouse. Yeah, that is pretty much it. You mouse controls the movement of the ship, with firing being automatic. Move that mouse around, to dodge enemies and their attacks, asteroids , etc. Use your mouse to fly into coins dropped by destroyed enemies and asteroids. If you want to sacrifice some of your coins, which act as your game score, feel free to fly into a power up like Rapid Fire or Spread Shot, to get a temporary boost to your abilities. Now, continue this as long as you can, because the only way it will end is by you failing to move out of the way of a hazard.LifespanWell, if you want, you can try to rank well on the leader board, but seeing the higher scores, I wouldn't expect you to ever see yourself there unless you are willing to cheat like other users. There are also a number of achievements that are unlikely to keep people playing.ClosingShort, simple and boring. Not worth the purchase at all. Save your cash and try a free to play shooter like Warning Forever instead.2 / 10"

,Not Recommended,257630,15704898,"Posted: 5 May, 2015",all,Flying Omelette,"Blast Em! is certainly not the best sidescrolling space shooter I've ever played, and is mainly only good for two things - a great techno/rock soundtrack and adding some easy (though time-consuming) achievements to your Steam profile. You only get one life and no continues, and the only real goal is to survive as long as possible as you try to get a high score. The ship fires constantly on its own, so all you have to do is move it around with your mouse. Score accumulation is slow because you only increase it by collecting coins from defeated enemies, and powerups cost coins. So, you have to play for awhile before enemies that drop higher-value coins start appearing, and once they do, you're likely to get wiped out. This means redoing the easy, beginning portion of the game over and over and over again before getting your shot at a really high score. I'm not sure if the game goes on forever or if it has an ending, and at this point, I'm too afraid to ask.It also has an annoying glitch that sometimes causes your ship to self-destruct for no apparent reason. The saving grace is that it often goes on sale for less than a dollar, so if your curiosity gets the best of you, just wait for a sale.Rating: 2/5"

Unnecessary tedious grind achievements are included for those who wish to torment themselves.Performance on medium or higher settings at 1920x1080 for some reason is very poor and stuttering is frequent even on respectable hardware way higher than system requirements listed on store page, probably due to bad/lazy coding as mentioned in other reviews and seen in the games' source code.Just avoid and buy a decent Shoot 'Em Up instead."

,Not Recommended,257630,17687548,"Posted: 23 August, 2015",all,Tmast98,"Blast Em! is an on rails 2D shooter that feels very much like an unfinished Flash game.The game consists of the player using the mouse to move the ship to that position on the screen, while the ship automatically fires bullets straight forward.As far as I got, the game only had two power ups.  One allowed the player to shoot bullets from the top and bottom of the ship, while the other made the player shoot bullets.  When you collect a power up, you lose money.  This is an interesting design choice, however after you collect a power up, its effect appears to be permanent, and collecting multiple of the same power up does not make the effects get better.  It therefore becomes an inherent goal to avoid power ups after collecting them once.EDIT:  Another annoying aspect of the game is the lack of health the player has.  One hit from anything will always kill you.Another frustrating thing about the game is the lack of a pause screen.  For a game that is an on rails shooter, with the goal being to accumulate as many points/kills as possible, being unable to pause the game in order to answer the door, feed a pet, etc. is very frustrating.Instead of this game, I would recommend games from theDigiPen Game Gallery, which are generally of higher quality and free."

It is simple and to the point; the title says it all really.What you have is an awesome soundtrack and a visually striking background set against a simple SCHMUP (shoot 'em up). You control your ship with your mouse, and you automatically fire and blast enemies and collect coins. That's it.There are achievements to lengthen the appeal. A majority of them involve going for upwards of a minute without collecting any coins (which is harder then it sounds) along with achievements for accumulating a large number of defeated enemies and a very, very high accumulated score.This isn't something you'll spend hours on in a single sitting. You pop this on for 10 to 15 minutes while you have time to kill, or until you figure out what other game you feel like playing.

While I can certainly appreciate a minimalistic design, and love a good side-scrolling bullet hell game, there's just not enough to do in Blast Em! to recommend it at *any* price.The visuals are extremely generic pixel art, the audio is utterly forgettable, and the controls feel stiff and unrefined. There is no story (not that this genre is known for its storytelling), no upgrade path, and extremely little variation in design from one minute to the next. There are free Flash games that look and play a lot better than this.I hate to rag on a game that an indie developer put hard work into. However, it doesn't seem like very much work went into this game, compared to other titles in the genre in the same price range."
