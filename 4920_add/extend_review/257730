It's fun and entertaining, a perfect way to spend an hour or two in front of the pc.To the devs: please fix the japanese faction (you know, the green one based on morale ) because they're absolute trash right now, lol."

,Recommended,257730,29885205,Posted: 12 February,all,Tritium,"One of the better card games i have played so far.  I'm just gonna list the Pro's & Cons.+Pro's> Card's look really nice and are well animated.> Both players play their moves at the same time so it's alot of strategy and trying to bait or outwit your opponent.> Can play against bots to lvl up and gain the IP currency although PvP hands out more.> Friendly/helpful playerbase.-Con's> It's not super popular.> Sometimes Queue takes a bit longer than usual to match you with someone in PvP, however that usually depends on what type of match your doing and the time of the day.Other than that i would recommend this game."

The play style, the art style, the fact that every single card is animated and the literally limitless possibilities for new combos and strategy’s that you create yourself. There are no boundaries, there are no limits, it’s seriously infinity wars! If you want a game where you decide how to play it, instead of the game deciding that for you, then honestly this is your game."

I would still recommend it."

I love it. If this sounds like your thing than try it, it's free after all. And don't forget to have fun."

The game is also too fidgety and there is no simple way to learn the game. Also due the amount of high ranked players, playing ranked is virtually impossible as there are only around fifty people on at one time and forty of them have every single card in the game. Most of my time has been in the standalone launcher (Around one hundred hours) which is very poor in terms of performance. Feels laggy when using it, even when on the same computer."

It´s hard as hell, the campaign and Tutorials are teaching u by the Try and Error Concept and if u fail u have to restart the hole match. This can get really ennoying and is not helpfull at all. I woul rather add the possibility to undo a round in the campain missions (except for the boss fights).I really wanted to give this game a positive Review cause its a pretty unique one, but i just can´t:I had a really great time and loads of fun, but imagine u are new to the PvP Mode and then u are just playing agains pros wich know every single card in the game. U just don´t stand a chance and get fustrated very fast.So why are the devs not improving this?Cuz u can buy card packs and card decks!You will see all those cool high lvl players reking you with ther high end ultra rare cards ( :D) and then you want to be as good as them. So you gonna go to the store searching for cards and u willl find out that a new deck costs 10€.This is how they make u pay.And if they would fix the matchmaking they wouldn´t sell anything anymore.Puffy this game! ;)"

76561198006878679,Recommended,257730,29823728,Posted: 10 February,all,necromancerkemmler,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and still do whenever I play it. This game has been plagued by bugs from the start and a few tend to pop-up every now and then after a new patch, but it's pretty much bug free at the moment. The game has such a unique playstyle with a battleground consisting of four zones to put your cards in. Besides having to worry about your fortress' health, you also have to take the morale of your troops into account - losing too many valued troops will ensure defeat as much a the destruction of your fortress. Combined with the synchronised turn system this creates a tactical element and a mind-game that is unseen in other card games! The different factions have a truly unique playstyle and some of the animated cards are something to marvel at. The learning curve is rather steep but this just kept me coming back to the game to learn more about it and improve my playstyle and deckbuilding knowledge.Give this game a try: play the campaign and some player matches with the free-to-play weekly decks and I'm sure you will be captivated by the experience."
,Not Recommended,257730,29714043,Posted: 5 February,all,Grauiores,"Got this game a few years back, and it seemed like a pretty cool game. The battle mechanics were pretty cool and the decks (and their card art) where really unique. However, the game was riddled with bugs, is still riddled with bugs, and many of those bugs actually interfere with your ability to play the game (freezing up, rounds not playing through, forcing you to leave a game you are in the middle of, random♥♥♥♥♥crashes, etc.).It's not like these bugs are a rare thing either, and for a long time I would look in the steam community and see a lot of people asking for these bugs to be addressed. Despite this, it seems like the devs were more interested in reworking the story mode (which was fine the way it was), making minor UI changes, and shoving out a grand total of ONE deck over the years.The game is also fairly dead now in comparison to when I started, often taking several minutes to find a match, which may crash or freeze as previously mentioned, and the people you get paired up with are either very new (which is not a problem if you're new to the game), or have put four times the amount of hours into this game that I have (which is a massive problem for new players) and no inbetween. The devs promised to fix that by advertising the game so more people would try it out, but I haven't seen any ads whatsoever, so the game is probably going to stay dead at this point."

Infinity Wars is obviously a card game, which I personally find to be quite similar to Magic: the Gathering, and I think that if you enjoy that then you'll enjoy this too. Keep in mind though, it can have painful server connections depending on where you are and how much your wifi router likes you. So, yeah, a recommendation from me."

Ontop of that that may have been the first tcg I've played that you can acquire every card without spending a dollar. Quite simply the art is amazing beeing animated and most likely like nothing you've seen before. I've spent roughly 400 hours in this game in the last few months and hoepfully that can be a testament to the quality of the gameplay. If you're shacky on trying IW give the campaign a shot, each time you level up you get free packs and various tokens/items as well as teaching you how to pay with an interesting story, albiet not the best voice acting. To top that off I don't think I've met a more welcoming community, alot of vets had helped me build the decks I need giving me cards for nothing in reutrn. anyways10/10 tcg,"

The only bad thing is the new company. They do not know how to advertise the game properly, and they already ruined the game with some usless op cards. The game is good, and il stay here til hes dead forever, but i dont recomend it for new players. Dont look at how many hours i have on this acount, i have somewhere to 3 years in this game.Pros:-Every card is animated.-Simultaneously turns make the require some think.-Tons of cards and more factions.-You can combine factions to make youre own deck.Cons:-0 Fariplay, as a new player you get to play even vs #1 on the leaderbords, so no skill lvl matchmaking.-Matchmaking seems rigled. No matter what deck i play enemy has always the deck who exactly counter me/-Huge long ques times, i waited even 15 min for a match.-Client and game are bugged, constantly crashes, frezzings, you lose games of the desync etc.-Draft is bugged.-Profile is usless. You cant see enemy badges, they have badges for things you cant get anymore, one of teh faction dosent even have a badge.-Op cards who can make 1 card deck, and dosent require any skill to play, if you make one of those decks you get easyly to 1750 points in 2 days."

The script the actors follow doesn't help any, either.Game-wise it felt clunky. Slow, awkward controls, not a lot of graphical feedback when playing spells (leading to ""did I play that?

Cause I enjoyed it, and because I worked for the developers.That was taken in the wrong way, and the review, which was clearly warrented because the game was pretty alright, was taken in the wrong way, as a false review (They didn't want it, because it seemed biased) so now, after I wasn't payed for the many hours I worked, or the actual work I handed in (which was enough for nearly 120 dollars of pay) I've decided, no, the company is actually really trash. Their games, whether released or in development, are trash. The people who work there. Trash. Their work ethics. Trash. Their ability to pay their workers for fair work. Trash.I hope this review is taken the wrong way as a biased review, cause it is.
