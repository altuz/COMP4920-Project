,Recommended,257750,12881680,"Posted: 10 November, 2014",all,Lohdel,"Fun, simple game with a good feel on the controls, that requires paitence and timing.The game is single player and multiplayer, local and online, which means you can do the adventure mode in a cooperative sense. (You'll probably be killing each other more than helping each other). Other modes are Race, and Deathmatch, so you don't always have to do the same thing.If you are interested in the slightest bit, it's worth the price when it's on sale, and if you enjoy a good challenge, then it's worth the full price.  The game even has a level editor, so once you complete all the levels, you can make your own, or download other people's levels and die even more."

I wouldn't say its as hard as some of the sections in I Want To Be The Guy or Boshi or anything quite like that, but its hard as nails.  It's also one of the best co-op games on Steam bar none.  It's an experience best 'enjoyed' with another person and the amount of frustration adds up to a lot of hilarity and the eventual release of success is a huge payoff that you really do all feel together.

If you're a fan of pure platforming, this game is decent, if a bit frustrating at times. It is not on the same level as Super Meat Boy or the I Wanna Be The Guy games, especially with it's lack of any sort of boss battles, but there is still fun to be had here.I played through this game in co-op with one friend. The 'co-opness' in this game is somewhat nullified by the fact that you can easily kill the other players by jumping on their heads, so you end up just taking turns attempting to complete each stage, making sure you don't both reach the same section at the same time and accidentally kill each other. It can be a bit fun repeatedly killing the other play to vent your frustrations at times, though, and the frustration of dying in this game is mitigated by the fact that your character instantaneously respawns at the start of the stage when you die.All in all, an okay game if you enjoy hardcore pure platformers."

,Recommended,257750,10846147,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,Zack,"This game is most comparable to Super Meat Boy in that you'll die hundreds of times trying to beat levels that require very precise platforming. Like Meat Boy, the load times after deaths are non-existent which is a big plus for this type of game. This game's main draw however is the competetive/co-op. I played through most of the game first with a few friends and then I played all the way through solo. The multiplayer surprisingly never gets too frustrating even though most of your deaths come as a direct result of playing with others. Playing with more than 2 players on the last two worlds can seem ridiculously impossible, as I had  a much easier time playing later by myself.My one complaint is that we encountered a few annoying bugs later in the game. One was a case where momentum didn't reset at a particular point after fans in a level. Not too bad, but slightly annoying. The other bug was on a few levels where the spawn was located on top of the door to the previous level, we would constantly enter that door upon death.Overall this is a fun party game that includes a few other multiplayer modes alongside adventure, giving it some decent replayability. Worth a couple bucks."

But it has also some flavor from ""Jinsei Owata Daibouken"" and ""Shobon no Akushon"" in some levels.Art style is good and reminded me 90's cartoons. Game itself represent a DOS game with clean visuals. Blood effects are awesome. Tracker musics are great, my favourites are menu music, first level and castle themes.I read the negative comments about online problems but it seems like online play a little bit fixed since last year but it still has some problems like connection timeouts or connection fail errors (i don't know if it is my dormitory internet or not though). There are enough amount of players and rooms but mostly they are private and they don't play Race or Deathmatch but Adventure mode; i don't know why. Hotseat (local) play is always available.Cooperative adventure mode is a little bit chaotic. You accidentally (or purposedly?) bump and kill your partner and/or prevent them to reach their goal or they do the same to you. Also they distract you because, you know, there is something moving over there or something funny happens. Time by time you or your partners activate a trap and you can't handle the timing of it and die. But these kind of incidents make the game more funnier.There is also a level editor named Aftershock but there are no guides about it and it's not so user friendly. You can find custom levels to play on Steam Workshop. Just hit the green subscribe button.I bought it for 2 bucks and i can recommend it to you if you like hardcore platformers.066 108 111 111 100 121 084 114 097 110 110 121 108 097 110 100 046 109 112 052"

,Recommended,257750,28687600,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Twistor,"Briefly:Bloody Traplandis a precision platformer of distinct levels. Alright game, yet some game design choices are rage-inducing in a mixed way.I bought this to a group of friends a couple of years ago to play together. We played it a couple of times (a few hours) and had fun trying to beat ""the story missions"". I forgot about it for a long time before coming back on a couple of occasions to beat the rest of the levels by myself. I consider it one of the hardest platformers I've played.Bloody Traplandis perfectly described by its name. It's a precision platformer where a tiny mistake means death and you may die hundreds of times before beating a level. The traps are everywhere and deaths paint the levels red (unless you turn off the gore). Adding some chaos, you can play it co-operatively or competitively with your friends.Action multiplayer madnessPlayed multiplayer, like it's probably meant,Bloody Traplandis good fun for a while. The bipedal cat furry humanoids run through the obstacle course that is the trapland and try to reach the door to the next area without dying. Jumping on a fellow furry kills them in a bloody pop, similar to the obscure multiplayer deathmatchJump 'n Bump.There's also a deathmatch and race modes with their own levels. To perfect the game, a par time has to be reached in the race levels that may benefit from or even require playing co-operatively.Level design is nice, levels are fairly complex or sometimes there are two alternate routes to the end. The story mode also has several routes through it, some requiring co-op to beat.It's too bad controls cannot be changed, and only one local player may play on keyboard with arrows. Up to four players may play with controllers though (I've tested and played it with Xbox controllers).Embrace the respawnName fits the game very well: Levels are filled with traps. Sharp traps, squishing traps, and surprise traps. Bottomless holes, guns, aiming cannons and bouncing fireballs. There are the classic spikes and sawblades, both moving and retracting ones and they come in several sizes. Occasional teleporter makes it initially impossible to tell how the level should be played out.Fundamentally, the traps are of four types: stationary, moving, periodic and reacting ones. The moving onesusuallyhave a distinct pattern of some kind (however see below). Periodic onesusuallygo off at set intervals (again, see below).Reacting ones are mostly fine: there's a gun, it's going to shoot when you go in front of it, and there are falling blocks that go when you step under them and get squished. These are all fine if initially surprising.However,Bloody Traplandhosts two kinds of traps that I absolutely abhorred:Hidden falling blocksJumping lava ballsThe hidden blocks are literally inside the wall, impossible to see before they first strike. The jumping lava balls bounce from the lava at quasi-periodic intervals at various different heights, impossible to anticipate.Both of the above traps can be kind of fun when playing with friends. When playing solo, they become extremely frustrating. The blocks because they artificially prolong the levels before you know to even try to avoid them, fire balls because they cause totally random deaths. You can pull a perfect speed run (required in the race modes for gold status), taken away from you at the very end through sheer chance by a fire ball that jumps at the same time as you, it's rage-inducing.ConclusionsI spent 19 hours withBloody Traplandbefore beating every level. That includes about 5 hours of co-op play with friends. Hardest levels/challenges were likely those that required co-op play because of the inherent requirement of coordination.I am left with mixed feelings of the game. With friends it was quite fun, and many levels were pretty fun even in solo play. But some of the lame traps made solo play incredibly frustrating and that utterly ruined some levels for me.So if you can live with that and/or you and your friends are up for Nintendo-hard platforming,Bloody Traplandmight be an alright investment. And if you really dig it, there's a level editor and so an infinite amount of custom content, if the extremely challenging original levels are not enough. Still, because of the above qualms, I'd wait for a sale."

In the time I've spent playing this with friends I can guarantee you'll have many laughs and most likely rage a little.There are a lot of levels in the base game and will keep you busy for many hours, but the addition of the workshop levels (level editor) gives this game an almost infinite replayability.One thing I would like to point out are the achievements, while plenty of these can be done single player, a fair amount of them will require you to play with at least one friend in order to access ""secret"" areas.In keeping this short, yes, I recommend this game.  At the time of this review its on sale and like I mentioned at the beginning, the second game is almost ready to release.  So, why not add this game to your library and give it a try, and if you enjoy it, maybe you'll pick up the new game as well."

And I'm not doing those very often, let alone getting such urgent impulse to actually close the game for it. But this game deserves it... I guess. Well, I'm just an hour in, reached only W3-1 but oh boy, it gives me some sweats – sweats of joy!Never have I played such a challenging yet achievable plattformer.  Admittedly it's not my preferred genre of choice on my computer, and console gamers could eventually prove me otherwise, but I'm having a blast!The gameplay is as easy as it gets – jump, run, duck, avoid deadly objects, just don't die reaching the exit. One lvl is merely one screen, no scrolling. One world has ten screens (plus some bonus stages), as far as I can tell, I'm in the last lvl of the 2nd world. For the adventure mode that is. There are also a race and a deathmatch mode which are obviously multiplayer modes. I've only tried adventure so far, as I'm testing candidates for the next local gaming party, but lacking a buddy right now. And this one looks very promising although you might gather a more experienced crowd. Now, it is hard as stated before and on entering a lvl you might think “how I'm ever going to make this?!”. But you are! It may take a while though*g* It's always doable, never unfair. It takes some plattfoming skill and timing. Controls are precise and responsive. Levels are riddled with – well – traps... where some of those aren't visible when you enter a new screen. But you won't succeed on your first attempt anyway... so.The graphics are – as you can see on the screenshots – retro styled, inspired by the 16 bit era. They're not particularly unique, but by no means dull or ugly. The gore effect which covers the environment with more and more blood as you're being constantly crushed by the fist of doom or saw blade of horror gives a weird sense of accomplishment. It's got a great soundtrack, I don't like the soundeffects though. Often they don't fit or sound awfully generic.I definitely recommend Bloody Trapland for solo players and I will vote for it on the next game night with friends."

It's not a bad game although it's not the best either. The soundtrack is really amazing. It sounds like something that would fit in an old school Mega Man game. However there are only a couple of tracks. Online play is just awful, the community is dead on arrival. The only way to play online with friends is if you host the game. It doesn't have Steamworks so it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to set up if you don't know how to host a game. Luckily you also have the option of local multiplayer up to 4 people. The gameplay is ok, it's one of those games like They Bleed Pixels or Super Meat Boy style games where one hit instantly kills you. It's boring by yourself but with friends it's loads of fun. It's an ok game. I can only recommend this game if you have friends willing to play. Another thing is this game for $10 is asking too much. Get it while it's on sale.

I just tried to make game screenshot, because all 4 of us managed to get to harder part of level, but when I pressed F12 game CRASHED.This title has potential, if it was on Early Access it would deserve recomendation, but now?Here are things that are in my opinion UNACCEPTABLE for a ""finished"" Steam game:- buggy, sometimes cannons stop shooting, game doesn't recognize that you finished level, taking screenshot for some reason clears level blood or even crashes game- NO KEY BINDING CONFIGURATION AT ALL and moving with arrows on my keyboard is not comfortable- only XBox controller is supported, I tried using emulator x360ce and it doesn't work- on game chat you can't use special characters such as question mark - why?- it's hard to find online games, because:.......1) list shows both passworded and open games and you can't filter it.......2) most open games are impossible to join, because you get ""timed out"" error, also game doesn't ping such rooms, most pinged (so I assume working) rooms are password protected, very few open games are pinged and working.......3) there's no refresh button on list, to do it you have to go back and open online menu again- with 4 players in game, most of the time you die, because somebody jumped on you, people often do it on purpose, it's irrtatinghttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=467906215I guess it won't surprise you that I think this game is frustrating. But the problem is, it's not dying or difficulty that is causing it, but lack of features and bugs. This game is not finished and I can't recommend it.Just look on game forum and see how many people got problems with it. And it's a title from 2013."

That's why I don't have that many hours in it.Get it? kekI'll keep this review simple and just put some pros and cons like most other reviews.Pros:- Extremely fun gameplay and levels. It's frustrating and that's what makes it hilarious to play with friends. You can kill them as they're trying to make it to the end - even you're not racing to the end. (If your group of friends is like mine, you'll spend most of the game trying to annoy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your friends instead of actually attempting to finish the level.)- The controls are fairly responsive. It's a simple game, not much to get confused about.- The vanilla game already has enough levels to play through. And if you want more, they lately added workshop support and it already has tones of maps on it.- You can play split-screen, online or LAN multiplayer. (I personally didn't have any problems setting up a LAN server over Hamachi. Though I heard some people do.)- Price tag is fitting. The game deserves it.Cons:- Not much, really. The only thing that pops into my mind is, playing the game alone might be fairly boring. What makes it fun is messing with your friends, at least for me. Other than that, looking at the price, it provides more than enough quality content."

Being a fan of platformer games, this somewhat reminds me of the classic NES ""Super Mario Brothers"". At first glance I thought the game would be similar to the Rage Game ""Cat Mario"" but this just proves the saying ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"". Bloody trapland has the uniqueness of a game that no one has created before. The puzzles do in fact get more and more challenging as you progress through eash level, but they're not impossible to complete. I would recommend playing this with 1 to 2 more people, but be warned it can get a little messy if you accidentally jump on a friends head."

Like I said, you have more than just going through obstacles, theres a racing mode which is the main game, but the first person to get to the end of the level wins that round. Theres also a deathmatch mode where you kill each other by jumping on your enemies heads (which can get really fun). This game is a must play for you and your friends. Buy this game"

76561197994085048,Recommended,257750,16898188,"Posted: 5 July, 2015",all,Remster,"Bloody Trapland is a hardcore platformer that encourages Cooperative play.I only played this solo so I won't have that much to say on the multiplayer front.The game itself is a simple platformer, the only real mechanics are jumping and crouching, however you can use your first jump as an air jump if you fall off a ledge. It is a very challenging game, and I was not able to complete the last level, however I was able to get there and play it for a while in about 5 hours. I feel like the playtime will mostly come from having to repeat the challenging levels over and over again. If you are not up to the challenge, this will probably just frustrate you.The levels are designed well in that they will make you think very hard in how to approach the different parts of them, and you will get penalized heavily for making mistakes. The game is very cycle based, which is one of my main gripes about the game. If you aren't familiar with cycles, it basically is the concept of things being time based such as moving platforms. The game is full of traps, and a very large portion of them are on a time based system. Because the game is cooperative, the timers are always going, the level does not reset at any point. This can be extremely frustrating. It is normal for cycles to be in platform games, but here it adds to the challenge in an annoying way. Let's say you attempt to do a level right when you load in. You die because you were 2 seconds too fast getting to Trap A. Now you start the level 2 seconds later, however you die to trap B because you were 1 second too slow. This is a constant process of trial and error that becomes more obvious in later levels. There is still a large amount of normal platforming challenge, but I feel the emphasis on cycles as well as the tons of layered time based traps in later levels, adds to a game you will want to stop playing. I feel like this would be made impossible in coop play. Cooperative play would be very fun but I can't imagine you would enjoy it at the end of the game, where you have to make extremely careful decisions about cycles to move on.There are also a few other multiplayer modes, but as I was playing this solo it wasn't really of interest to me. It still might be fun to try those out with some friends. There is also a level editor, which is always a really cool thing to have in games to keep things fresh and try out your ideas.There is the main set of about 60 levels but there are also secret levels you can find which can be a neat way to get through worlds.I don't think there is any story in the game. You're just a bunch of cats jumping around.ProsCooperative SupportVery ChallengingSolid Platforming MechanicsLarge amount of levels including hidden worldsExtra Multiplayer Game ModesLevel EditorConsUnforgiving or downright impossible to casual playersMultiplayer might be more trouble then it's worthCycle Based Level DesignNo StoryAll in all I did enjoy the game, but I really hated having to ""watch the clock"" per say just to beat levels. It made me want to stop when I got to the last level just because there were about 20 different timers I had to keep an eye on. If you have some friends that want a very difficult platforming experience, or you yourself are a hardcore platformer lover, you should pick this up7.1/10"

Ha sokat játszol vele persze kikupálódsz és eszméletelen látvány lesz mások számára hogy hogyan viszel végig egy akadály pályát. Ha túl sokszor halsz meg persze egy idő után felbasz. Csak nézni jó, ahogy más játszik vele, mert akkor legalább lehet röhögni. A játék kivitelezése nem rossz, főleg hogy pálya készítője is van, ami igen kevés játéknak adatott meg mint áldás. A játékban ha többen játszanak, alternatív megoldás gyanánt lehet leküzdeni egy akadálypályát és másik irányt vetve a térképen. A csapatnak, főleg ha 4-en játszák, nagyon összeszedettnek kell lennie, mert naná hogy legalább minimum 25-ször le lehet halni a legkisebb akadályba is ha a cspattársunk útba van. A játék átlagát tekintve szórakoztató, a szivatások pedig csak egyre nehezebbé válnak ahogy mentek befele a pályákon. 90%-os akcióba vettem meg egy 4-es csomagba, magamnak meg néhány haveromnak, mert anélkül drága lett volna nagyon."

The game claims to have Online coop but the only problem is the programmer failed badly at setting up a friendly interface for it. It's very difficult to have your friends join the game you host. You have no options at all when it comes to hosting a game. Also you can't just simply host a game then thru steam have your friends click on ""Join Game"" That feature does not exist. Your friends have to try to find your server that you hosted in the servers list and of course like I said you have no options for setting up a game so this means you cannot create a server name. The server name is your User Name. It's very unlikly your friends will even see your server being hosted. Another way to join is by Ip Address which one isnt giving to you.Online Coop is very diffuclt to set up. Bad programming skills. Also 9/10 times it will have a connection failed or timed out for joining servers on the server list.The actual game play is bad as well. Yes it's a simple game but its missing a lot of physics and basic math. Things don't line up quite right and it's difficult to control your character. If your okay with a very very VERY basic and dummed down game then this is the game for you. I suggest buying it at $1.00 not for $10.00 or even $2.50. The programmer lacks basic programming skills but I can't complain too much because well....The game shows how far the skills went.Overall I say 3/10. Yeah its thats bad. It can be fun if your super bored but you might get more entertainment by playing with your toes. Good luck!"

,Not Recommended,257750,10007468,"Posted: 3 May, 2014",all,Orisno,"Although Bloody Trapland originally looks promising, it quickly loses its appeal. The game is no more difficult than any typical platformer, with its ""difficulty"" originating from unclever traps (blocks you cannot see crushing you). Instead of the skill game you would expect from a ""difficult platformer,"" the game feels more like a memorization game - memorize the location of the traps and develop a muscle memory to work through them. Also, multiplayer is mediocre at best - it's far too easy to accidentally kill your teammates in adventure. For those of you seeking the deathmatch option, it really doesn't work with less than four players. In my experience, two players just led to a spawn camper (with correct timing you'll instantly die upon spawning) and with three two players can easily team up and ruin the fun for another player. Finally, the ambience of the game is lacking a great deal of work. The tiles, music, and characters feel childish. No particular theme is accomplished, as many games which choose a more ""retro"" look. I would avoid Bloody Trapland - It's not worth the cash. Maybe pick it up if it ever goes on a super sale."

Addicting. Especially at the end of a long series of death in a level, you are satisfied with complete relief but, keep going. This game is a series of levels/stages. In which you are some sort of cat, you play through frustrating stages that brings usually death. There is a reason why it is called ""Bloody Trapland"" because when you die, there will be blood. I would recommend this game because it can be fun some days and god awful other days though. It is worth it's low $10 price that brings a feeling from the unfair flash game series, if you are familiar, as they are as well a platformer."

14056948248686741,Recommended,257750,19509191,"Posted: 5 December, 2015",all,Mellow,"The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is a muscular and tubular part of the female genital tract, which in humans extends from the ♥♥♥♥♥ to the uterus. The outer ♥♥♥♥♥♥l opening may be partly covered by a membrane called the hymen. At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ allows for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and channels menstrual flow, which occurs periodically as part of the menstrual cycle.The location and structure of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ varies among species, and may vary in size within the same species. Unlike mammalian males, who usually have the external urethral opening as the only opening for urination and reproduction, mammalian females usually have the urethral opening for urination and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥l opening for the genital tract. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥l opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans. In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary and reproductive tracts.While the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plays a significant role in human and non-human sexuality, its role with regard to human female sexuality (including heterosexual and lesbian sexual activity) is especially documented. Less is known about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of other animals. In human females and a number of other female mammals, ♥♥♥♥♥♥l moisture is increased during sexual arousal by ♥♥♥♥♥♥l lubrication, which reduces friction and allows for smoother penetration of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ during sexual activity. The texture of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥l walls create friction for the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥during sexual intercourse and stimulate it toward ejaculation, enabling fertilization. In addition, a variety of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other disorders can affect the ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Because of the risk of STIs, safe sex practices are recommended.Cultural perceptions of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ have persisted throughout history, ranging from viewing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the focus of sexual desire, a metaphor for life via birth, inferior to the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or as visually unappealing or otherwise vulgar. In common speech, the word ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is often incorrectly used to refer to the ♥♥♥♥♥."

This game, however, takes one back to the days of old, where you simply have one objective: to get from point A to point B... without getting cut by buzzsaws, shot by turrets, burned by lava, impaled by spikes (need I go on?)Those who enjoy a challenge, and enjoy thinking out every single step and movement will enjoy this game, because it is indeed the difference between life and death. And while there is absolutely no story to be told of, I doubt that really matters because if you're at all like I am... you'll spend more time getting a headache and just trying to figure out that one... exact... jump, or that one... exact... step to excel past that random thing that killed you last time.All in all, it's a fun little game, and worth the money, especially now since level creation has been integrated, and if you have a buddy, it's even more enjoyable to watch them react after countless deaths, and as blood sprays and drenches the landscape.
