76561197971199745,Not Recommended,257790,9397874,"Posted: 9 March, 2014",all,Kuvo,"I have a hard time recommending this game in its current state.First the things I like.The games controls great using an xbox 360 controller.The game looks really good.  They didn't just port the mobile version, they upgraded the graphics and it shows.I have not been able to connect to a multiplayer game yet to make any comments about that.  The game just sits there saying waiting for other playersWhat I don't like. and hope they are able to fixFirst the sound.  I am a huge fan of hydro thunder.  And part of what makes that game so awesome is the whole background music and co-pilot talking to you type thing going on.  Sadly there is none of that in this game.  I actually really dislike the background music, it fails at making you feel like your on the edge of your seat like it does in hydro.The sound effect used for wrecking your jet ski is just plain bad,  reminds me of broken glass.  seriously I just trashed a jet ski and the best sound they could come up with is the sound of dropped glass?I could learn to live with the whole music thing, after all I can turn it off and play my own tunes, which I would recommend doing.  However after 37 races I am losing interest in this game very quick.  I have gone from this is really cool to this is really annoying.  We all know this game is a port of the mobile version.  The mobile version had in app purchases.  Now to their credit they did remove that part of it.  For the record I hate playing games that are pay to win or we are gonna make you grind grind grind.  Well that's what it feels like to me, a giant grind.Yes this game is nothing more than a grind when you get right down to it.  I am on the third series of races out of 9 all together.  Within each series you have multiple races.  Each series requires x amount of stars to open and each race within requires x amount to open.   I  started to notice after the first series that I just could not compete anymore.  I spend what little money I have on upgrades and bam all of the sudden I am coming in 2 and 3rd.  I have reached yet another point in the 3rd series where I simply can not compete cause my bike is not good enough.  So what do I have to do, gp back to the first series of races that I can actually come in first place now and start racing them over and over again until I earn enough money to be able to compete once again.  An average race only lasts a couple mins so it doesn't seem bad really.  But let me give you an example.  I need 60,000 to unlock all 4 upgrades to my bike.  I would buy a new bike but to get a comparable one in stats it would cost me 100,000.  If you win a race you can make approx 1100 to 2200 if i recall a race.  if come in second or even third you get paid squat.  You do gain extra founds every time you level up as well.  for example if you reach level 8 you get a 8,000 bonus.  a thousand per level if I remember right.My problem with this all is the fact I have reached a dead end in the game.  I can't win any more races to collect stars to be able to continue in the game.  The only way I can accomplish that is to upgrade my bike so I don't keep getting smoked by an average of 4-6 seconds.  And the only way to upgrade my bike or buy a new one is to grind out races I have already won over and over again.Keep in mind I am only in the 3rd series, this may or may not get better.  I don't know and a may never find out because I am already burned out racing the same couple races over and over trying to earn money so I can upgrade my bike.I can't begin to tell you how many hundreds of hours I have sunk into to hydro thunder, from the original arcade to the dreamcast, even this company's redux of it.  This game was a no brainer for me to purchase.  Kind of regretting it right now.  This is not the next hydro.  However with a few tweaks this game could be awesome in its own right."

The choice of vehicles isn't a lot but theres still enough choice for different types of races.The career mode is challenging enough with race, elimination, hotlap and freestyle events.The online play is not busy at the moment but at least there is online play and also ""friend invite"" online play which works well.My favourite mode is the VR challenge, which is basically racing 2 or 3 laps of a selected track in the quickest time possible. Your best time is recorded as a ghost so you can race against yourself. But what makes it even better is that your steam friends best times are compared to your own so you can see their character on screen racing and your own which gives you incentive to beat yours and your friends best times, taking corners tighter, boosting at the right time etc. Also you can see the best times on steam on the global leaderboards so you can see yourself climbing the leaderboard each time you improve your race time. So what you waiting for? Go out and buy it and see for yourself. 9/10 rating overall. For the price? 10/10"

It feels like you are racing in a futuristic water park The courses are really well designed.Executing tricks will charge your turbo boost meter different amounts depending on the difficulty. Using turbo boost will rocket your jet into high speed thrill mode where you will need to have adept timing to take turns and hit jumps with precision. One of the keys is knowing which trick to pull at the right time.  The better your stunts, the faster you'll go. The waves are active and knowing when to slash through or glide on top of them is another of the many facets of timing and skill mechanics that make RP2 so enjoyable.The ghost feature allows you to race friends and yourself to improve times and climb the leaderboards. Plus, you can race up to 5 players in online multi-player. Throw in a lengthy career mode and kick azz music and you have one of the best racing games around that's easily worth the price tag.Thank you for bringing RIPTIDE GP2 to Steam as I don't own a ""mobile device."""

In my opinion, if a game is good it can exist on any platform and still be a good game so it doesn't matter what platform it originally came out on.  With that in mind, lets review.If you were ever a fan of Jet Moto, Sled Storm, or any other arcade stunt/racing games you'll find yourself remembering the great times you had with those games within Riptide GP2.  What the game lacks in graphics it more than makes up for in fun.  While I say that keep in mind that although the graphics might not be up to par with the current generation of games they are still fairly decent.  Furthermore, the action is smooth and I've never experienced any slow ups or lag while playing.Physics wise the gameplay is loose.  Don't expect a realistic simulation of jet skis or water racing here.  Instead you'll find a more arcade style of gameplay physics which is, once again in my opinion here, a nice refreshing change from all the hyper-realistic gameplay that many other games try to convey.  Not that I don't enjoy some realism in my games, but sometimes its nice to just kick back and not worry about all of that.In terms of general gameplay expect to have a blast trying to get the best time while performing some crazy stunts.  The stunt system is fairly detailed and stunts are set by your level, which gives you a chance to make your character your own.  Other customizable features are the ability to choose the colors of your ride and your rider.  It's not super detailed, but enough to make it your own.  The courses in the game seem well laid out and there's a wide variety of racers to choose from which you buy and upgrade using money you earn while racing.There is selection of multiplayer options within the game which was somewhat unexpected.  First up is your standard online multiplayer.  I've raced others a handfull of times and the action is always smooth and fun.  Second is the race for time multiplayer in which your times on each course are sent out to your friends where upon they can race a ghost of your gameplay.  This is a nice option for those who may want to compete against others who may be on a different time scale than others.  Finally there is a multiplayer split screen option for up to four players.  Personally I have not tried this option yet and found it fairly unusual but nice within a PC game.Overall the game is a lot of fun if your not looking for realistic racing action.  There's at least as much content within the game as there was in any of the Jet Moto games and in my opinon is well worth the price of admission.  If your looking for some simple fun races with plenty of options to play with friends you've got to try Riptide GP2."

,Recommended,257790,9376366,"Posted: 7 March, 2014",all,❅Icy!,"Boat racing? Vector Unit? Count me in!Vector Unit, the developer behind this game, are responsible for the very excellent XBLA game, Hydro Thunder Hurricane. If you're a boat racing fan, be sure to check that one out. It's on Windows 8 for PC and XBLA for Xbox 360, of course.This was a mobile game, and you can tell in some places, but it's a very, very good PC port. It has everything you need. Plenty of graphics options, automatic controller/keyboard support, all that stuff.The mobile stuff (optional auto-acceleration feature) is in there, but it's fine.The graphics have been enhanced from the mobile version, and they look really good. If you haven't played the original version, then you'll be in for a treat. The art is fantastic, as in every VU game.The music... It's beautiful! There are a couple of tracks I don't care for, but there are a few more I just absolutely adore.VU, I want a soundtrack to buy!It's kind of modern sounding. Not really dubstep, but close to it. I hate dubstep, though, so that's kind of odd. It's just really nice to listen to. For me, at least.There are 12 tracks, and they all have a unique theme. Pretty to look at, but you don't have much time for that in this game.It's extremely fast-paced. Stop for a second and you're going to lose.There are a few shortcuts/alternate routes on (some of?) the tracks, but they're not the main point of the game. If that's what you love about boat racing/Hydro Thunder, then you won't really find much here.But no, one of the main points of the game is to memorize and pull off cool stunts in the air to gain boost to go faster and beat your opponents. (In some cases, the clock is the opponent as well)There is a TON of customization for your boats. Basic stuff like paint, upgrades, etc, but still, quite a bit of customization. So if you're into that, then I can assure you, it's on full display here.The career mode is simple. You just play the various events, try to do your best, earn 1-3 stars per event, and use those stars to unlock further events to complete your career.There's a time trial mode, and if you are a big nut for that kind of thing (like myself) then this game will offer endless replay value for you. Gotta keep trying to shave off a hundredth of a second here, another hundredth of a second there, and so on...There's also split/screen multiplayer for up to 4 players! That's a fantastic feature that virtually no PC games have anymore. (I think) it only allows controllers in split/screen mode, though, so be prepared to gather up all your controllers, heh.The online multiplayer is fun. I hope a lot of people end up buying this game, because we need to have more consistently full (6 player) matches! 1v1 can be fun but that's not how I want to play online boat racing. :(Last, but not least, we have the controls...They're OK. I'm used to games like Hydro Thunder, Split/Second, Burnout, and so on. The controls in this game aren't quite as... tight? responsive? as you're probably used to. You just have to hold down a bit longer than most games to get a tight turn. The track design plays OK with this kind of control, though, so it's pretty much all good. The main thing is just you, yourself, getting used to the controls. After you do that, they're fine.Overall, I'd say 8.5/10. It's boat racing with a huge emphasis on tricks and boost, not too much else. Made originally for mobile devices, so it's not a very complex game with crazy twists and turns and huge variety, BUT it's still a very good game. Well made, fun to play for a while (especially if you like multiplayer or time trialing), and so on.The game has a nice style and charm to it, but I'm a huge boat racing fan so I may be biased. You'll have to try it for yourself.For $10 dollars ($7 during launch week) I consider it a steal, but that's just me.I can't wait to see Vector Unit's next game! :)"

Make no mistake, this is a budget game and I originally played it on my mobile. The transition onto PC has worked pretty well and the game definitely benefits from using a controller. The graphics, sounds and music are well implemented although I use SweetFX to further enhance the visuals.The core structure of the game is simple;  compete in various types of challenges to earn stars and unlock new events. Competing also earns currency and skill points. The former can be used to purchase and upgrade racing craft while the latter allows new tricks/stunts to be earned. When stunts are performed, a boost meter is filled allowing a considerable pick up in speed. This becomes essential for staying competitve in later stages.The hydro jets interact well with the dynamic water surface which ultimately leads to a fairly satisfying and enjoyable experience. The controls also respond in a consistent and fairly believeable way.On the down side, the races are a little short (2-3) laps and the courses fairly similar (mainly closed but some which are more open). I hope that this issue is addressed should Riptide 3 be made.If you can pick this up on sale, it's a firm recommendation if this type of game appeals to you."

This game was an intant classic for me and I still play it a lot. Get it and you won't regret it!Basically the objective of the game is to beat the other guys to the finnish line, and to get there quicker you will perform a combination of stunt combos (of your choosing from the many options) so that you get a speed boost on your bike/Jetski/Hoovercraft/pod. The more complex the stunt, the more speed boost it will get you, and this system will make both a racer and a stunt master out of you.I was surprised to see how well it runs on a Win 8.1 machine, especially because it was originally made for tablets, yet the PC version is well polished and the controls are smooth. I also find the concept to be VERY atractive, the racing style is super fun, and the bikes are very awesome. As you progress through the game, you will start to make lots of money which you will use to buy more bikes and to upgrade them to beastly set ups. I find that only three bikes were actually critical to have (Lanzer, Manta, and Scorpion) but that may be a personal thing. Still you will likely get all the bikes and upgrades since there seems to be nothing else to do with your money.For those of you that prefer console style controllers the game accepts XLinput Xbox 360 style controllers, though I wholly prefer the mouse and keyboard for this game, this of course is a personal preference.If you are into arcade games, then you really need to give this game a try!"

,Recommended,257790,18244241,"Posted: 28 September, 2015",all,BillLensel,"""Riptide GP2"" is an ebullient, restaurant-style arcade racer. It offers those simple controls and that cheeky nonrealism, where the racers and their jetskis can collide with walls and merely stop in their tracks like titanium buoys. Players can pick up easily on the accelerator and steering, while taking in plenty of handsomely lit, futuristic environments and arena-size music. (It makes EDM the sound of tomorrow - today!) I also want to say, this is the first game I've played since ""Super Mario Sunshine"" that made me notice how spectacular its water effects are.It can be hard to anticipate a turn or a bumpy water surface, and coming in third place for the thirty-seventh time is frustrating. But the strategy offered by the stat-balancing customization system and the expandable stunt list is alleviating. I could recommend it just for its presentation value and accessibility, but the strategy in how you can enhance your racing machine is what puts ""Riptide GP2"" over the top."

I want to like it more than I do and that is mostly due to the nostalgia I have for Splashdown and Splashdown Rides Gone Wild from the PS2. Those games were just plain fun and they both looked and played awesome. I was hoping this game would fill that void but it doesn't. This game looks really nice but the gameplay itself is lacking in fun. Until you race many times and upgrade your first jet ski, you will really need to work hard to get even one of the three stars. The turning is just so sluggish that you are really struggling to find a good line. So until you upgrade, the ski handles like molasses.Next - the boost. There is no control to it - once you hit it, it all expends. You can't control it in bursts - it's all or nothing. That's just poor. The tricks are pretty neat but you seldom have the amount of air required to do really nice combos. I won't give up on it because it isn't terrible, it just isn't as fun as those PS2 games were and still are. And that's just a shame, with all the power available in a PC nowadays. Devs really need to remember how games still need the fun factor to be a hit."

The water racing and the tracks reminded me a lot of Hydro Thunder from my Nintendo 64 days. But, after that wore off, it realized it was kind of shallow and lacking in any sort of big fun factor. Here are a list of complaints I have about the game;- Is clearly a mobile port with little to no upgrades- Controls are pretty meh, even for a racing game about driving on water (which I expected to be less tight than a road racer)- Lacks any large fun factor, like high speed or something of the sort.Those are really my main complaints. Don't get me wrong; This actually seems to be a competent mobile game. However, as a PC game, it really isn't anything special or big. Also, nobody plays online.

The physics in the game feel so real you almost feel the spray of the water as you jump off each wave.

However, the computer-based opponents are actually intelligent unlike many other racing games, and there is a split screen mode so you can play with your friends on the same machine. The fact that it is water-based instead of land-based has a surprising effect on the game and gives it a very different feel than most other games in general.

Acceleration and breaking just feels more natural having variable pressure triggers.The game itself seems pretty basic, like most racing games: enter race, the higher you score; the more points/money you get; use money to upgrade your vehicle, etc.  You also have the one added element, you have a XP based level, and as you up your level, you earn points to unlock tricks you can do when you hit a ramp.

I enjoyed the game the more I played, but there was a point where I started noticing a few missing elements.Riptide GP2 is a sea-doo racing game that provides multiple modes. One of the main modes is career mode. In this mode, players have to progress and compete through multiple levels in order to attain a 3 star ranking. Once players have acquired enough stars (max of 3), they may move on to the next stage. There is also a leveling system regarding the rider and the player collects points after each race. With these points, the player may buy new sea-doos, customize their sea-doo or rider and upgrade their current ride. Players can also unlock new tricks using their points. The more complex the trick, the more boost the player will receive. I am glad there is a trick system in place, but I feel it's a little bit too rigid. I felt there was a little more control and creativity with Wave Race while Riptide relies on a combination system. Meaning, you have to hit ""left + right"" simultaneously with both thumb sticks in order to do a trick. The tricks are cool; issue is that it will be difficult to do more than one trick per jump. The more tricks you land, the more boost you get. You are allowed to activate your boost whenever you'd like during the race. There are quite a bit of events to do, but the game is quite difficult even on normal mode. Any small mistake can cost you a few seconds which can make a world of a difference when completing the final lap. Thegameplayis pretty decent for the most part. It feels like a little bit more could have been done to engage and immerse the player of having the feeling of racing on a sea-doo.Thevisualsare actually pretty good in the game. The collisions between the water and the sea-doo aren't perfect, but is still smooth. Riders and sea-doos themselves look pretty cool and the arenas are neatly designed. The only issue with the visuals/animations here is when players collide - there isn't much of a reaction. I've landed on top of AI's and they have landed on top of me and my player was fine. Did not fall or tip into the water. I think this was a huge missed opportunity as this could have been that motorcycle road rage game on the water. On the plus side to the animations, they made the execution of the combos really neat. A simple move can be upgraded and can become complicated and unexpected. It was definitely awesome how they put together the simple with the complex.The menus are also easy to navigate. Thesoundsare alright. I haven't noticed much difference between sea-doos or collision sounds. I think a little more could have been done here to make the player feel like they are creating the splashing and crashing sounds.Overall, the game is pretty decent especially for the price I paid (under $4). The difficulty can be a bit of a turn off, but once you get the hang of things its certainly rewarding. If you are hungry for a split screen or a Wave Race like game, this is it. I would recommend waiting for a sale. For future Riptide games, I would definitely recommend a small option of sea-doos to start with, put in animations/neat collision systems for when players collide or land on top of one another, and keep the different types of races/games going with battles or sport like games. It can be a bit grind-ey, but does have its moments of beauty.RATING : 6.9/10GameplayB-Story / CampaignC+Visuals / User InterfaceB-Sounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityC+OverallC+"
,Not Recommended,257790,9462306,"Posted: 13 March, 2014",all,Sysgen,"Riptide GP2 does not project a positive introduction.  The initial bike is slow and has terrible turning capability.  To make matters worse I found the rumble to be too subtle and though the water is aesthetically pleasing the surrounding graphics are not PC acceptable though the cheap price mitigates this complaint.   There is nothing fun about the game during this phase.Eventually through the acquisition of additional bikes, tricks and abilities the game hooks you and I found myself hooked, eagerly awaiting to participate in the next event.  A high compliment indeed.  Let it be noted that my first purchased bike was a mid range bike named as the ""Lancer"", essentially not exercising the option to purchase any of the slower bikes and this may be the reason why I did not experience the need to grind for cash as reported by other players on the game's forum.  The selection of the Lancer also is probably why the game hooked me as well given it's well balanced attributes and significant performance boost over the initially allocated bike.  A fun phase of the game to be sure.Ultimately you will elevate to the more powerful bikes and upgrades for these bikes will just about maximize the bike's attributes (acceleration, power, handling and boost) and this is where the game falls apart as Riptide GP2 is a mobile port housing tracks which are CRIMINALLY too small for the higher end bikes.  It is at this point in the game which should be the most fun but Riptide GP2 winds up as a literal fish out of water as you find yourself constantly crashing and performing tricks into walls.  Some may argue the need to know the track and boost accordingly but the game became significantly arduous.The developer Vector Unit has a good lineage with water racing games (XBLA Hydro Thunder) and should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for not putting the effort into extending the size the tracks for the PC platform.  A hall of shame inductee for sure because during the advanced stages, Riptide GP2 should be glorious and instead outed itself as nothing more than a huge washout."

With boost you can speed up your hydrojet for a short period of time and/or perform other tricks.  In each level you can earn 3 stars. With these stars you unlock new events. There's also multiplayer but at the time of writing there aren't that many players around. But that may change since the game just came out on Steam.

It would take a lot for a game to reach its heights.  Riptide GP2 comes close to being as great as that game.Where Riptide GP2 is most like Hydro Thunder is in its controls, game play, and fun factor.  This game is a blast!!!  Oh, and speaking of controls.  I've seen some early reviews of this game stating it doesn't allow you to control acceleration, and instead auto-accelerates like the tablet version.  This isn't the case.  It offers you both types of control, so you can manually control your speed if you wish.The graphics are great for this game and I'm glad they upgraded them on PC!  This isn't a lazy port of the tablet version.  It all runs buttery smooth and your eyes will be very happy.  However, the graphics aren't as inventive or as diverse as Hydro Thunder; both in tracks and vehicle types.   This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it keeps it from Hydro Thunder greatness.My only gripe about the game is it feels a bit grindy.  It takes a lot of races to unlock tracks and exceptional new vehicles.  Still, this is a minor nitpick.  (Oh, and I shouldn't forget a slightly related nitpick that really makes me clench my fists in anger.  On the Steam page they mention Riptide GP2 comes from the creators of Hydro Thunder Hurricane on Xbox360 and Windows 8.  For someone who refuses to upgrade to the POS Win8, and doesn't want to purchase any games off of XBox live, I'm left, like other Win7 users, out in the cold when it comes to the cool sequel to the beloved Hydro Thunder.

HTH's water felt like jelly.  Also, keep in mind, a boat handles waves better than a jetski.  You could kinda cushion your boat against waves when turning in HTH, whereas in this game, you are punished more for driving across them.  If you're used to HTH, you will not be ""in the groove"" for the first couple races.  However, it doesn't take very long to get used to.  The challenge makes the game feel more rewarding.  This feels like a water racing game trying to be more like Forza than WaveRace - if that makes any sense.  I feel like this is what Gran Turismo would be like if it was the future and the Nurburgring was covered in water.  Those are the kind of games that the steering difficulty remind me of.  At first, I didn't like that, but it's starting to grow on me.  Also, this game is in 60fps, whereas Hydro Thunder on the xbox360 maxed at 30fps.  That's a great thing for a racing game.They're both great games, but different experiences.   This game is totally worth it, though.  Hopefully this review shed some light."

It's not worth almost 10 €! The graphics are lousy, the steering knows only two modi (none, full - thank you, touch screen-port) and there are not enough circuits. After three cups, you'll find it repetitive already.The graphics: Wave Race 64 had a rider that moved according to waves. In Riptide GP2, the rider sits like a buddhist monk, no matter what. I can ignore the lousy stands and understand that all venues have the same blueish water but I won't accept the 90esque textures on any main object (jet ski, rider). The surroundings actually look nice.The controls cannot be remapped! Luckily the stunt system is simple and sound (if you combine two moves, the commands will be the same as for the single stunts). The career mode seems to get easier after the second to last cup. It's a fun game because of the split screen-mode. You'll have finished the career mode in 5 hours. After one hour you'll have seen EVERY avaivable track. The races are way too short and you can't set how many laps you want to do. A FREE DLC could make this a decent game!"

Yes, they are!- Water is pretty realistic and bouncy.- Achievement system is realistic and achievable in 10 hours (to complete the game)- Earning money, XP and new hydro jets do not require much grinding, they progress naturally.- Simple hydro-jet upgrades.Cons:- Multiplayer yet to be updated.- It is perhaps a little bit too simple, especially if you demand more complexity from a racing game.- Maps are simple, short and repetitive. I didn't find this much of a problem though since most racing games are pretty repetitive to me anyway. There is enough variety here to make you play differently (e.g. the icy tunnels are much trickier to boost through).- Music is alright, though apparently is an iffy rip off of some stock-soundtrack (source: TB's review)- Is looked down upon for being a mobile port (yet I personally feel this is irrelevant)Result:This game is great for anyone who wants some fun hydro-jet racing to pass the time or complete achievements, without having to grind for money or upgrades. Even better to play with friends, though up to 10 hours worth of entertainment if you do it solo.HoweverI wouldn't recommend this game if you already like other racing games because the chances are you will find complaint with the lack of maps, detail, challenges and engine customization."

There is no story in Riptide since it’s just an arcade racer but you won’t be expecting one either.Gameplay & Controls:3.5/5Riptide GP2’s control scheme is suited to controllers and feels smooth enough, you will sometimes find yourself a little annoyed at the course layout in the later parts of the game when you have fully souped up late-game hydro jets – I know one course in particular there’s a boat you cannot avoid hitting without ignoring your boost for a few stunt ramps which just feels like a design oversight but overall the levels are fun and I don’t try and avoid too many of them. The icy stages sometimes feel overly snakey however. I feel like I just didn’t look into this long enough but there needs to be a way to shut your boost off and I don’t think there is, if I’m wrong please feel free to let me know, that alone will bring the score up. It must be said that I love Vector Unit’s wave and water mechanics a lot though.Music & Sound:2.5/5The music is fitting but that’s about all I can say about it. Vector Unit likes to supply their games with a fairly energetic soundtrack and cycle through it at random, that’s a little disappointing for a few people. It doesn’t seem like they put a lot of thought into how they use their soundtracks. It doesn’t stick out too much but I know some people play games solely for their scores and it seems like it’d be worth exploring in the future. Hydro Thunder Hurricane was the same way but the music in that game was actually exciting and if there was a particular track you really enjoyed you could select it at the beginning of each race. Again, it’s not something I looked too far into but the music in GP2 isn’t anything special anyway so… eh.Visuals:5/5The game is pretty, and I love the animations your riders have for their stunts. I’m a massive sucker for crisp looking aquatic effects so I can’t complain about anything here, stunning game guys. With Riptide Renegade on the horizon I’ve been checking prerelease videos of that out and it looks even better so I would say this is something Vector Unit excels at.Overall:3/5I give this a 3/5, there are some things that can be improved upon and if there are some mechanics I’ve just missed then I can bump it up to maybe a 4 but it would feel generous. I have to say that I do enjoy playing it so I will recommend it, but be prepared for an annoying grind session before you can do anything fun. That would have to be my biggest gripe. You don’t start out with a hydro jet you can use for very many races so you find yourself grinding races for cash until you can get a few upgrades or a new jet and move on. The online community is pretty scarce which is another shame since VU’s Hydro Thunder Hurricane’s online play was a delightful experience in comparison. I remember playing HTH online with a few members of the dev team and remembered how stoked they seemed to be when it came to making games like this so I am very hopeful for everything they release later on down the line. Now if only we can get a follow-up of HTH I will hail Vector Unit as my indie hero."

It tries to be both, ends up satisfying neither itch.  It has very futuristic very slick looking jet skis, and it was designed by Vector Unit.  Why I can’t buy Hydro Thunder or Steam in this day and age I’ll never know.For a mobile port it’s honestly quite impressive… if you’ve got the attention span of a ferret on crystal meth.  Graphics aren’t the best. Sound is generic.  Gameplay is repetitive.  Choice of watercraft is average to good, not great.It’s a fun way to kill time. If you pick it up on sale for $2.09 like I did, you really can’t feel too badly ripped off.  Buy it cheap. Play it in short bursts of 30-45 minutes as a warm up to something more tactical and it should last you a solid 10-15 hours before it becomes tired.Track selection is limited. Watercraft selection though limited has a lot of customizable upgrades in a market that is under catered.  I like racing games though I’m tired of racing in cars. I want jet skis, weaponized hovercraft, airplanes, even snowmobiles, and this sates my appetite in short bursts.There is a reasonable variety of unlocks, upgrades and tricks that should allow for some reasonable replayability which should double for every friend you can talk into buying it. The VR ghost challenge like feature is fun, if you can get the game cheap for yourself and some friends.Apparently there is also a sequel which is third in the series overall called ‘Riptide Renegade’ which looks far superior, I have every intention of purchasing it when it goes on sale for $4.99 or under until then if you like aquatic arcade racers, you really can’t go passed Riptide GP 2.Give it a half hour spin twice a week and the fun factor should last you 3 months or 6 months to a year depending onhow competitive you are with your friends.  Expect online multiplayer to be dead and if you go out of your way to unlock and upgrade every hydro jet, then god knows.On weekends I generally use Riptide GP2 as a warm up before running headlong into Hand of Fate, rolling over to Elder Scrolls Legends and finishing up with a session of Street Racing Syndicate which when compared to Riptide GP2 is effectively like  taking a hot bath and dropping a Valium.If Ii put 26 hours into this game over 12 months, then I’ve had my fun with it. In short bursts it’s perfectly serviceable and compulsively playable if you’re as keen to unlock and upgrade all the hydro jets as I am.  The core gameplay loop is repetitive, soothing and an even satisfying no-brainer.I’ll buy a lot of games in bulk, I’ll play them for between half an hour and an hour and a half and I’ll end up refunding about 80% of them.  I don’t care about price, it’s the principle. Life is too short for bad games. If it’s not fun I ask for money back.I wouldn’t pay full price for Riptide GP2, especially not since Riptide Renegade is out. If you can get it on sale and pick it up cheap you really can’t lose.  I paid $2.99 for Cards of Cthulhu and that stopped being fun around the 45 minute mark. Riptide GP2 suffers no such problem.At the time of this writing I’ve put 3-hours into Riptide GP2 and I’m not tired of it. Even if I quit next week I still feel I’ve gotten my money’s worth out of it.  It’s not worth $7 when Renegade is worth $10. It was definitely worth $2.09 on sale.It’s not the prettiest game,  it’s not the best optimized, its showing its mobile heritage, its age is obvious and its soundtrack is generic however in spite of all of the games more than noticeable flaws it’s still a fun time-killer with an arcade feel, probably aimed at time poor old muppets like me.If the sequel is half this good I’d even consider dropping a fiver for it in the good faith they’ve fixed the floaty controls, upped the graphics and gotten some better background music.  If you can pick it up for less than the price of a cup of coffee… do it.  You will not regret it."

It just made your eyes pop out and made you giggle at every turn.But, sadly, all of that is gone in Riptide GP2. There is no joy like there was in HT. The environments in Riptide are stale and sterile. I haven't found any hidden passages or anything fun about the racetracks at all. They just seem bland and utilitarian. Gameplay is straightforward, and feels underwhelming. There is a bit of sensation of the water moving your craft around a bit, but it just doesn't feel like anything special. Graphics are decent, but about as interesting as looking at your refridgerator. Sound is, well, just simply sound. Nothing visceral and heart-thumping.To earn boost, you have to do tricks, ala SSX. But why? What was wrong with the boost system in HT? Surplanting the boost system with a long list of unnecessary tricks is a complete distraction to the racing experience and isn't particularly fun.Now, granted, I""m not really far into the game yet. But that's another thing. I SHOULD be much further along by this time. I have to keep racing the same races over and over and over again to earn upgrades, because there's no chance of affording a new craft anytime soon. And the upgrades don't seem to improve my times. So I just have to keep doing the races over and over until I get lucky or something. It definitely feels like the type of game where ""you'll win when the game DECIDES to let you win, and not a moment before then."" Which means absolute tedium, frustration, boredom, and irritation, which is the opposite of FUN.It's just not as good, not as fun, not as engaging, not as smile-producing, nor as memorable as Hydro Thunder. Not by a nautical mile."
