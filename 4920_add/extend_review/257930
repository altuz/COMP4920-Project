Another company acquiredRace To Mars(One More Level) and promised that they'd finish production, update it on a weekly basis, and communicate to players about the state of the game.Those were lies. They haven't updated the game weekly, nor did they do it for even one month. It has now beens months since the last update, and the developer has gone silent. DO NOT BUY THIS VAPORWARE.ORIGINAL REVIEW:First off, let me be clear: there is virtually nothing to this game. Beyond the basic buildings that have always been available, the vast majority of mechanics listed in the games description don't exist, with even its most vocal supporters only logging less than 10 hours due to no content. The developers hadn't produced a single update for nearly a year, hinting at some elusive ""massive update"" that they always claimed was just around the corner. That update has FINALLY come out, and it couldn't be any more clear that this is a scam. What's the big change?... a simple UI overhaul. The campaign is non-existant/unplayable since literally only 3 buildings (of the over dozen that have always claimed to be ""around the corner"") are in the game. Well, scratch that--2 of the 3 buildings say ""Under Development"" when you click on them. The 3D world you play within always looked unrefined and sloppy with underaverage visuals, but their one annual update seems to have managed to make it look even more unprofessional. Add on top of all of this that the game STILL contains choppy english, and well...I wanted to really like this game, and I tried to trust the developers at their word, but this ""game"" is nothing more than an empty slot on Steam, attempting to take money from people by tricking them into thinking they're buying a game in progress. It's not. DO. NOT. BUY."

The latest one actually managed to fix Mac support - it hasn't been working on Mac OS X for several months, so I've had the opportunity to check the state of the game for the first time this year.

No launches are possible, no planes fly, not even as much as a popup saying 'Hey you launched a satilite, good for you'.  I usually don't spend time writing reviews, too many games to play and so little time, however I will not say do not get the game only to be warned that this game has had some rocky beginnings and at this time is falling short of community expectations.  I have had this game since its release on EA in March 2014 and at this time have only been able to justify 6.2 hours of game time.

I love the idea, the current level of play is very bare, but I can see where they want to go with it and am very much looking forward to seeing it.And that's what this is right now. Potential. They have had issues with personnel, and their update timings are atrocious (once every month or two at best). They haven't had a patch in a long while, but they have teased a major update that they haven't been able to bring to fruition yet.I haven't lost hope in Intermarum or this game yet, but I can't recommend the game as is. If this game is something you think sounds like a good one, put it on your follow or wish list and keep an eye on it, but don't buy it as of yet. Wait until the next update at least. It's a month or two overdue now. Which leads me into my next point...They seriously need to up their PR game. Weekly updates would be awesome. Even short ones, just a few sentences saying they added new graphics to 2 buildings and tested 3 new contracts. Whatever. Anything to let us know that work is still being done. Something that will keep us even mildly interested. And make the game look less like just another Early Access that went down the drain of development hell.In the end, like I said, it has potential. It's current state is playable (at least, i've been able to launch satellites, but that's it), but is so very barebones right now. I hope to someday change this to a yes and go get it recommendation, but at this rate, it's going to be a while.UPDATE: They've finally released their long awaited ""Apollo Update"". The game looks quite a bit better. There's quite a bit more to do. It's seems to not be abandoned just yet. There's a lot that still needs work. Many of the buildings don't have a GUI or any use really yet outside of required for research. It looks like you can build the buildings, research the technologies and build sapcey things. One significant point to note, the amount of spacey things you can build is ridiculous. This was obviously the meat of the update (along with the graphics and GUI). The number of satellites, rockets, pieces of equipment are extensive. You can go all the way to building a fully sustainable Mars Base on the planet of Mars, it looks like. The one thing I wish they had put into this release was the contracts idea with the NSaAO, but that's not in there yet.I won't change this to recommended quite yet, but the game is playable, with all the research and pieces you need to build a Mars Base it looks like. If this game is something you want or are looking forward to, I would consider getting your hopes up. I'll probably change this to a yes once they get the contract system up and running so that you can have an effective, money-making space enterprise. I'm feeling much more positive about this game now."

I am not thrilled that the developers allowed such an unfinished product to be released for sale.  Most of the building meshes are incomplete, most of the buildings have no functionality,  the tutorial is broken and it is quite obvious that the developer's first language is not english. Normally, this would be a minor issue, but a good portion of the game revolves around simulated text based interviews with journalists.  Your answers affect the prestige score of your company, which as of this build as far as I can tell does nothing.  However,  the mistakes are enough to detract from the game at this point. Some of the very few functional screens remain completely untranslated, which further exacerbates the issue.  Once complete, I believe this game will be fun and well worth its price of $20 if the developer delivers."

In BARIS, the focus was very much the Space Race of the Cold War and beating the USA/USSR to various landmarks; RTM however is set in the 21st Century and has you competing against private companies who are also looking to reach to Mars.I have only played the game a little bit, but it seems to be fairly intuitive as many of the menus do what you would expect them to, with only one or two screens which confused me. Some actions such as launching the first satellite would be improved with tooltips or something else to make the process a little clearer.It is an Early Access game, so there are features needed to be added, and some of the screens either haven't been translated into English yet, or the language needs a little tweaking to make the meaning clearer. That being said, with the ability to launch a wider variety of missions to be added at a later date, I can see this being a game I could sink many hours into further into development."

Then - after purchase - I was firstly disappointed of the actual status of development which had nothing to do with the nice trailers. There is an incomplete techtree, lots of ""lorem ipsum"" text-placeholders, no way of generating funds whereas the first buildings as well as research are quite expensive. The only functionality is placing some buildings and watching the sun go up and down until bankruptcy.I know this is an Early Access game and I was really tolerant with all the issues described above because the game idea conviced myself and I trusted the developers to increase functionality over time. BUT in fact there were no improvements at all for over 6 months now. No updates, no communication, nothing! Perhaps my expectations are too high but at least I'm expecting a continous development once a game enters Early Access state at Steam.Don't waste your money for this!And finally some words regarding Steam:Steam-Support only reacts with standardized ticket-answers after my refund-request with reference to the ""long playtime"" of now 3 hours (which is only slightly more than what is refunded under ""normal"" conditions).What I do expect is a mechanism from Steam to kick out inactive projects or developers from the Early Access area.

However, at the current state of the game, it seems more to me like something I would call ""Pre-Alpha,"" meaning that it is in such early stages of development that it should not be released to the public yet as an early access or Alpha access game. I say this because most of what the game promises to offer is not even implemented yet. There is not much to do besides hire engineers, buy and build buildings that are pointless and take anywhere from 2-12 months to build, have your engineers research things that take anywhere from 20-500 or more months to research and are also pointless. Also, it takes only 2 months to build an entire facility, yet 4 or more years to research the properties of anything, like alloy or fabric? I could do that in two weeks, on my own! Not with 30 other engineers helping me research!Another note: The grammar. The grammar is horrible. However, for the most part they use commas correctly (most people in the world don't), but there are huge spelling mistakes and other, much larger grammar mistakes, as well as careless typos like missing letters or words or extra letters or words. And one of the only two working buildings is not even in English.Overall: The game is crap right now and should not have yet been released to the public. But the game does have very great potential for the future, though not really as a space game. It's mosly more of a political and waiting game.It seems that at this point in production, and the rate at which they are updating (not at all yet), this game will be done in a few years, if not decades if not centuries."

Tutorial Incomplete, Lacking Information on almost everything, etc etcI would like to see this game completed one day and hope it would be a success.Good Luck INTERMARUM"

So far it doesn't look like it's going to be anything really great either; it's not that it promises to be a bad game at all, I just don't find the game mechanics to be all that interesting.Despite not finding this game all that great I've decided to recommend it anyway; for one simple reason. The developers are open about the problems they've had and that's worth a lot more to me than a great game, which are really rare anyway."

And the god awful noise that forms the ""soundtrack"" - even with ""Sound Off"" set in the options. Or the picture that does not stand still for one second but keeps moving around all the time for no apparent reason - there's the one screen - why does it move? And everything needs 4-5-6 clicks with the mouse to actually do anything.Horrible - so far from reasonable to charge anything for it."

One update a month keeps them from being sued.Some of us waited for over a year being patient... then another year...  and what we got in return, and nice nutsack punch!Wish that did it for us....!DO NOT SUPPORT FRAUD!
