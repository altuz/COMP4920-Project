,Recommended,257990,14218318,"Posted: 28 January, 2015",all,CJayMarch,"If you've played Genesis and Super Nintendo platformers as a lad... heck, even Sega CD ones (I can't be the only one who remembers Wonder Dog... can I?)... this true-to-the-classics 2D platformer is calling for you!What I like the most:+ For slightly over a dollar, this is certainly much more than the bang for my buck. Without replaying for extra achievements, I put in 5 hours to beat it, so it only cost me somewhere around 20 cents for each hour played so far.+ The art... both levels and characters... are excellent, and the goofier ones remind me of beloved cartoon characters and props, like the Three Eyed Fish from The Simpsons.+ Much like the Super Mario series does with coins, collecting the abundance of stars gives you a sense of fun and satisfaction.+ The length of the game is perfect, and although there are only 4 worlds, there is enough to explore in each of the worlds' levels that it feels as if there are more.+ Upon completion of each of the first three worlds, you get a new powerup that helps you on your quest and provides a new gameplay mechanic (e.g. gloves that allow you to latch onto walls.)+ Ever download one of those free Mario clones from Google Play? Imagine someone actually spent time on the level design, didn't throw a bunch of ads at you, and actually updated the gameplay mechanics as you go along (such as the aforementioned glove example.) Such is Oozi!+ No gimmicky puzzles: pure platforming!Some nuanced critiques:- The difficulty of the bosses isn't the most balanced... I found the second boss to be much more difficult than the third and fourth bosses. They also can be time consuming to defeat, so it can be a little aggravating when you almost have your battle won, die, and then realize you have at least several more minutes to go to get back to being as close to beating that boss as you just were.- Oozi's death groan got under my skin a little, and after awhile I found myself imitating it in order to cover up the game's loud and croaky rendition of it.- The ending is really short.Recommended: Absolutely. It plays like a classic 2D platformer, and though it doesn't reinvent the wheel, there's certainly nothing wrong with that."

,Recommended,257990,29126620,Posted: 8 January,all,ХD,"In all honesty, I don't understand people who've downvoted this game because it's ""just another platformer"" with no unique elements whatsoever.It literally says in the description that what you get is ""a classic 2D platformer with old school gameplay - no puzzles, no punishment, just 100% pure classic platforming fun! Its most prominent features are HD visuals and beautiful hand-drawn art."" Nowhere does it say that you'll get more than what you pay for. And, believe me, at a 4,99€ price tag, Oozi is well worth the investment, plus it's often on sale.A decent platformer with 4 difficulty settings to choose from. I'm playing this game on the ""hardcore"" setting (this is apparently the right setting for experienced platformer players) and it does provide a nice scale of difficulty. You start every level with only one ""energy bar"" so if you get hit, it's game over... Well, not literally, as you restart the game from the latest checkpoint. Also, the game encourages you to collect as many stars as possible (plus 5 secret stars that unlock a challenge level), since they give you points, and you get an energy bar for every 2000 points. So, you're not collecting said stars for high scores alone.There are 4 worlds (5 quite longish levels + boss level each), plus challenge levels, plus arcade levels. Also, the controls are amazingly responsive, which cannot be said for some high-budget platformers out there. All in all, a worthy title if you're in it for the platforming elements (like I am), and nothing else!"

You jump around, gather stars, stomp funny looking creatures on the head while avoiding falling into lava, water and being crushed (among other things) on your way to the exit.There are 4 difficulty levels to choose from, ranging from being immortal to 1-shot you're dead. However, loads of checkpoints make dying a minor issue so if you got some experience from this type of games then hardcore's the way to go.As you progress in story mode you'll unlock extra bonus levels that offer new, unique challenges that'll keep you going once the story's over.Something I believe to be very important in this type of game are the controls and I'm glad to say that they were excellent. Easy to learn and the little alien do as he's commanded (and yet I somehow managed to drown it in lava more than once).I wouldn't recommend this to a hardcore gamer who's looking for something difficult to sink his or her teeth into because the game's not that hard. If you're looking for a fun, casual platformer however then it's great!I would also definitly recommend this to parents who seek a game for their kids but don't like all the blood and gore that's so common in most games today. If your kid is old enough to understand the controls then this is a really good game!Personally, being of the NES-generation I actually did have a lot of fun with this one and although I'd never give it a 5 I can't see any reason as to not give it a 4 =)1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played"

,Recommended,257990,16257714,"Posted: 8 June, 2015",all,jpsf91,"A fun casual platforming, so if you are looking for a challenging game, i suggest you go look somewhere else. The game has 4 difficulties, but even the hardest HARDCORE one isn't much of a challenge. Sometimes is harder, but you'll never be stuck for long. The bosses are kinda dull and repetitive. And the story leaderboard is broken, because hitting bosses and dying will keep netting you points, even after retrying. So, if i beat a boss on the first try, i get 2000 points. If i hit him 2 times and lose, then retry and beat him, i get 4000 points. It just doesn't work. But the challenging mode is cool. Although it's never overwhelming, it's challenging. And i hated the arcade mode. It's a cheap way to extend the game's life, because you have to play the story levels again, but this time with a timer. And getting max rank is hard, because the stages are long, and if you lose you have to start from the beggining. It isn't fun. At least the challenges are shorter and fresh. But the arcade mode just fells cheap. But besides these flaws, it's a good game, just not as hard as you may expect. Like i said before, it's a fun casual platforming."

76561198034063409,Recommended,257990,13098107,"Posted: 26 November, 2014",all,Renomaki,"To some, it may look like just some so-so title that isn't worth a glance due to its small-time nature. But to me, I think it is a little (and I do mean LITTLE) gem in a sea of games of various qualities and polish.Oozi is a humble platformer about a Rayman Wannabe who crashes his ship on a random planet, and thus is thrusted onto a quest to get his stuff back and return home. Storywise, it isn't much, but in this day and age, I suppose a simple plot is better than the overly dramatic stuff you get nowadays.Once you get into the first level, though, the game certainly does start to charm you, with its lovely art style, its decent soundtrack (That is forgettable, but still nice to listen to throughout the game), and its easy to learn gameplay. It isn't a hard game persay, but it isn't a walk in the park either. I had times where the game did surprise me with some challenging platforming, which kept me interested and provided some satisfaction when I managed to survive past a difficult challenge to the next checkpoint. The game also throws out some interesting (if short lived) gimmics at you as well to spice levels up as you continue on your quest, from rock titans that can only be killed with short-fused bombs to security systems that require timing and smart jumps to avoid in order to progress through a part of the level. Sadly, many of these gimmics are often one level only, which is a shame they don't use some of these gimmics more often, because some of them really are interesting.In the case of Bosses, there are four worlds each, with a boss in each of them. Ironicly, the first boss might be the hardest, because every boss I fought afterwards (even the FINAL BOSS) was rather mild. They still kept you on your toes, but they didn't seem awfully threatening. Really, the levels before the boss is where all the fun is, what with all the secret stars you can collect in each level to unlock challenge levels you can play to, well, challenge yourself, so there is at least a bit of replay value after the story is complete.Sure, this game isn't the best platformer out there, it isn't gonna get any ""oooohs"" or ""Ahhhhs"" or even ""11 out of 10s"" out of you, but if you are looking for a decent little platformer that you can easily get into that'll provide a satisfying experience for a low cost, this is worth checking out. For anyone expecting something more intense, though... Look elsewhere."

The art is quite nice, animation is smooth, and the overall style is bright and quirky.The challenge level varies wildly, though.  There checkpoints are placed in some strange areas, where you could easily get stuck redoing a large section of the level because of a really tricky part just before another checkpoint.  However, it's impossible to ""lose"", since if you die you just reappear at the last checkpoint, and you can retry as long as your patience hold out."

,Recommended,257990,22661330,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,Harley,"Poor Oozi. The perpetually grinning yellow alien isn't likely to join peers like Mario, Meat Boy, Rayman, and Sonic among the ranks of the platforming protagonist elite anytime soon. Awesome Games Studio has indeed erected a vibrant and deadly world for its fledgling hero to charge through, but for all its visual creativity, Oozi: Earth Adventure is missing a certain spark to elevate it beyond its by-the-numbers approach to the platforming genre. It touches on all of the familiar bases without adding anything particularly interesting to the mix. That doesn't make it a bad game, though finding a reason to keep plugging away when the unflinching difficulty gnashes its teeth is a struggle.Stars boost your health and your score.Oozi is a likable-enough fellow. He's cheerful, slightly dim-witted, and prone to dying from the littlest of scratches. His day job as an intergalactic deliveryman hits a snag when he runs out of fuel and crash-lands on planet Earth--only this isn't quite the Earth you're accustomed to. Overrun by strange critters and humanoid aliens that are wrecking the place, Earth isn't such a friendly planet anymore. It's here where Oozi wakes up alone and without all of his high-tech doodads to help him. His quest to recover pieces of his missing gear and ultimately find his ship so he can be on his merry way starts off simple but soon ratchets up to a serious challenge.At its core, Oozi: Earth Adventure is a no-nonsense 2D platformer that draws many of its mechanics from classic games of the past. Rather than innovating, it's concerned solely with testing your reflexes and your patience as you zip along and navigate your way through increasingly insidious stages littered with deadly obstacles. Checkpoints are liberally scattered at first, though they stretch out in the later stages that really push you to master the environments through repetition. Oozi can only run and jump to start, but recovering pieces of his missing suit grants additional abilities that change the gameplay up in mostly predictable ways. Before long, you can double-jump, butt-stomp, punch enemies, and wall-jump. But even as new skills are added to your repertoire, none of them feel particularly exciting. They're familiar to a fault; the constant recycling of old ideas saps much of the sense of reward you get from earning new powers.Despite their mundane scope, these fundamental abilities are still handy as the environments get tougher and throw bigger challenges your way. Sneaky stage designs quickly scale upward in complexity to ensure your trek isn't an easy one. Spikes, monsters, lasers, platforms, and all manner of other obstacles are meticulously placed to provide maximum irritation. Reaching checkpoints becomes an especially grueling process in the latter half of the game.Out of the woods and into the mad scientist's lab.The fact that environmental dangers do get a little more inventive as you go helps balance some of the frustration of dying over and over again. Hauling and hurling timed explosives through long stretches to take down walls is an interesting and nerve-racking challenge. Ducking into the background to avoid monsters is clever too, and the screen-warping visual effect that kicks in as you approach running out of air in poison-gas zones is a nice touch. These accoutrements complement the overall excellent visual design. Oozi: Earth Adventure is a sharp-looking game.Staying alive is a tricky endeavor. Oozi is a fragile fellow, but collecting a certain number of stars as you jump and pummel through each stage does let you boost your health. Hunting down special bonus stars also unlocks extra stages to play in Challenge mode. Infinite lives is the ultimate savior here, since death comes frequently--sometimes even seconds after your last respawn. Oozi's jump mechanics and midair responsiveness aren't always as tight as they need to be for certain maneuvers. Wall jumping in particular feels off too. Despite hitting the controls with precise timing, you won't always stick or rebound as you should, and these sequences turn into aggravating wrestling matches with the game mechanics that frequently end with a drop to your doom.As a result, pushing through tough spots to hit the next checkpoint can feel grindy, though your reward for making it is not having to ever replay that same stretch again. That is, unless you're a true glutton for punishment. Arcade mode lets you revisit stages for speed runs that have you pushing to a high score as fast as possible. Challenge mode is more enjoyable, since it offers up fresh stages with primary and secondary goals to complete.Who knew that such evil could leap from the sea?It's hard to fault Oozi: Earth Adventure for simply sticking to what works within its genre, like so many other games before it. But there's not much here that feels fresh or exciting. The platforming action poses a formidable challenge and offers some nice variety across its diverse areas, but it's disappointing that this cartoonish adventure rarely pushes beyond the bounds out of its tidy, safe little box. Being generic and sporadically punishing doesn't totally outweigh the fun, as there is some to be found here, and the frustrating moments are pushed through with a bit of patience. Oozi: Earth Adventure just doesn't do enough to stand out in a crowd of similar games.The GoodNicely crafted visuals and art directionStages are cleverly designedThe BadMajor game mechanics lack originalityHeinous difficulty spikes hamper the fun toward the latter half of the gameMovement controls are spotty when wall-jumping and in midair"

There's different things to collect that further your progress and it feels like it is legitimately necessary to retreive these ""upgrades"" as they allow you to fully access new levels.I bought it on sale for about $1.25 and I think it was definitely worth the $5 that it usually costs.If you like platformers in general, I'd say this is certainly worth the money.One thing that some review lack is a section discussing controller controls versus keyboard controls. This game does not require a huge amount of button presses all at once, but there are scenarios where it is required to press up against a wall, press jump, and then press the opposite direction away from the wall. On keyboard, this wasn't overly difficult, but was WAY easier on my controller."

It’s not as fulfilling as Super Meat Boy (or as hard!) and the controls are not as sharp as Rayman Legends.  But, it’s fun and I’m happy to play a game that doesn’t have the pixelated “throw back” graphics (which I think has become an excuse for untalented designers to release games).  I was able to blow through most stages in my first try and generally only died when having to use Oozi’s wall grab, which is hard to engage when you want it (I’m not sure why the game designers decided to key it off the direction I’m pushing instead of a button).It’s a great way to spend a couple hours and worth $10."

It has that oldschool 8/16-bit era feel to the game play but with high def graphics.  It doesn't try to be anything other than a good platformer.  Kind of reminds me of the Giana Sisters.  No gimmicks or other nonsense, just an alien trying to find his things scattered across a world, avoiding/jumping on enemies and collecting stars along the way.Probably not everyone's cup of tea, perhaps not challenging enough for many, but I've enjoyed my time playing through the first world already, and I expect the other levels to be equally enjoyable."

A list of pros and cons are in order for it.Pros-Hardcore was sort of challenging-Easy money when its on sale for cheapNot too many pros I could think of when reviewing the game. It was rather lackluster in performance.Cons-The storyline was poorly done. (it was told with text on pictures,no animations or anything)-The humour in the game was crude at best. When your character is climbing down a vine, there is a visible buttcrack. The boss fights had Oozi- Not very bright yellow thing (or something like that) vs. I dont remember specifically but one of them said ""he also smells""-The boss fights were fairly simple, easily done in one go.-The ""challenge levels"" were not very challenging imo.Overall I feel like Oozi compares with a browser type platforming game. It was lacking in storyline, gameplay, and had poor humour. It is not worth 5$, but it comes close to being worth it if it is more than 85% off."

The absolute hardest difficulty is a breeze, and the only reason you die is because you hit a patch of bad game design, either through ridiculous boss battles, the stiff controls, or a camera that can't be bothered to follow you until you're too close to the edge. If anything, this game is great for kids, because kids will play anything and they don't have a filter for crap. For anybody else, it's something to do when you're bored and there's almost nothing else to play at the moment. To top it all off, the music is forgettable and the visual style is trying too hard to be Rayman.So, why am I giving this a recommendation?

Also random crashing - luckily only when loading a new level, not midlevel. If there was a ""neutral"" or ""mixed"" option I'd gladly use that instead of ""Not recommended"".

Which game would you not buy ( Big rigs: over the road racing) for 50 cents? The gameplay is what a good platformer is, and because I suck I play on normal difficulty. the artstyle reminds me of 90's 3D and I like it. The music is okay, not the best out there. I give this game 9.5/10, cause nothing is perfect.And for all the people who say this game is repetative, which platformer isn't repetative?"

It's very kid friendly on the lowest difficulty (i.e.: the ""kid"" difficulty), and it's rather on the easy side for everybody else too (though I didn't try the nightmare difficulty yet). There are four levels in every world (each world has a distinct theme and scenery), there are five worlds in the game, every world ends with a boss fight. The boss fight is easy to figure out and not very hard to win, even the last one.The level design is good. There are several paths to cross every level, and there are five ""secret stars"" to be found in every level, usually barely hidden in sideways passages.The story mode can be beaten in a handful of hours, say 4 or 5 hours without rush. There are other modes (with different levels and worlds) to continue playing after that. I'm currently experimenting the arcade mode that I find interesting.This game is definitely worth every single penny of it's (very cheap) price and more. If you're looking for a cute and pleasant platformer for casual play, this one will fit the bill very well. It's definitely not the next ""metroidvania"" in which you'll spend you next 500 hours of gaming, but it does very well what it does: an entertaining casual platformer with some variety and some exploration.Nicely done."

It actually helped me to get over some boredom, at least whilst FFXV was taking forever to install on me Xbox.No bugs, no lag, no worries. It's just a shame it has no personality to boot.6/10, would play again."
