The game isn't complete yet. It's not even close. And they don't reply to any questions, bug reports or anything. Looks like they got their money and ran off like so many indie dev's nowadays.Update:I made a huge bug report topic where I posted every bug I could find over a month ago. I also sent them an official bug report using the form they made for it. Then after not hearing anything from them I sent them an e-mail asking wether or not they were ever going to finish the game. They responded that it's done in their eyes. After stating that many attacks go through walls they replied that attacks are suppósed to go through windows. Are you guys even reading my e-mails?Pretty much everybody who has ever played this game disagrees with the statement that this game is completed. I guess they just confirmed that they took our money and then ran off.Do not support these developers!Update:After a long time I started playing again two or three times for an hour this week and it was remarkably bugless. (I didn't reinstall windows, steam or the game and I'm pretty sure there wasn't an update, so there was no reason for the gameplay to improve.)I stand by what I said before, but if you are in luck and everything works as it was planned it sure is a lot of fun. Also using cheats can help. I always get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when a zombie does a special attack through a wall, but I just give all my guys Kevlar to compensate for the damage they shouldn't take. Makes it all a lot less frustrating."

Turns out the answer is ""a lot"".Before writing the review, I completed the campaign, played some Death Lab and Survival.ControlsLacking. There are keyboard shortcuts, which is a plus, but the amount of micromanaging is just annoying. There is no way to give your squad very basic commands like ""walk over there, but hold your formation"" or even ""guard here, look a little bit left or right occasionally"". I mean, yes, they aren't trained soldiers, but come on - that's very basic ""use your brain to survive"" stuff.Variety / Difficulty / ReplayabilityPersonally, I found it too easy. Take an easily defendable position (beware windows), shoot single zombie, run back to squad, profit. If there are hearts, use melee and sneak your way through.  After the hearts are disabled, progress as usual. As this works almost every time, it also gets repetitive. New equipment isn't a necessity, it just achieves victory faster.The different game modes. Yes. Campaign is as described above. Then there is Death Lab, which I actually liked. Kind of. It, too, got old pretty fast. Survival mode is a joke. I kind of expected it to be like the campaign, just without the story and a larger or procedurally generated map. Turns out, there are no branches, no loops, no nothing - just node after node, going in a straight line to the right.So, is the campaign worth replaying? After all, the store page promises random elements. And again, no. While it does, in fact, randomize the campaign map, the actual nodes seem to draw from a pool of predesigned maps and/or houses. While this in itself isn't bad, there are just too few of those to keep things interesting. Even halfway through my first (and only) campaign playthrough, I never encountered any new layouts (excluding the ""story nodes"")BugsJust look at the forums. Also, I played this game some months ago, and the bugs are still there. Chances are they will never be fixed, with the developer disregarding bug reports and calling the game ""finished"". Again, read the forums for details on this. I can just list the bugs I personally encountered. They range anywhere from ""minor"" over ""annoying"" up to ""gamebreaking"".-) Gamebreaking: Rescuing more survivors than you have space for locks you on the ""send survivor to city"" screen.-) Grabbers and Jumpers don't care about walls.  And by that, I really mean WALLS, not windows. I encountered this many times while defending, but I is especially glaring with the survivors hiding behind the ""hidden button"" doors, suddenly being surrounded by Jumpers halfway. And yes, that also happens before the button is pressed. One time, I actually watched them glitch through the door (Apparently, they cared more about the locked-in survivor than about my squadmates standing directly behing them).-) Once hunger and bug-related deaths start to fill up your graveyard, it is virtually rendered useless, as there is no scrolling.-) Many more minor stuff (like the game randomly unpausing when giving commands), but really, I won't list them all, considering the much more major bugs.Survivors / City Map / ResourcesGood idea, but IMHO, poorly executed. The resources themselves are sparse at first (not a bad thing!), but around the early late-game, they are completely useless. Except for food, of which you will not have enough. By far. Ever. You will have way too much of everything else, mainly because the blueprints drop much faster. By the time you first have enough resources for the first firearm blueprint, you will have found much better ones. Even with reasonable mid-gear upgrades, your squad will have the best equipment far before the campaign is over.The survivors... Apart from attracting more zombies on heart maps (IMHO the only difficulty spike over the course of the campaign) they are useless as well. When they don't break your game (see ""Bugs"" above), they idle around in your cities. ""Idle"", because it is very easy to avoid the zombies attacking back. In fact, the only time that happened to me was when I explicitly wanted it to happen (Achievement! Yay!). And even if they WOULD need to actually defend your cities - chances are they couldn't. Remember what I said about food a little bit earlier? When you run out of food, survivors die. Seems logical. BUT: The dying survivors are NOT selected randomly. It always hits the most recently rescued ones. Chances are pretty good that those are the survivors manning your cities on the front, leaving them empty.Graphics / SoundVery good. The graphics fit the gameplay, the music fits the situations, and... yes. Short review, but that's all there is to say about it. I especially liked the Death Lab BGM.SummarySo, the summarizing question: Knowing everything I do now, would I buy the game again?No. Plain and simple. For reasons, see everything above."

I'd get more enjoyment out of a few rolls of charmin ultra than this game. Tried to get into this game. In short it's a very limited game and theres a lot of broken mechanics which really makes it unplayable.Characters can get grabbed and pulled through windows (windows are unbroken and you cant walk through them) so you can have a unit maxed out with gear and he just gets yanked through an unbroken window into a house of 20 zombies and dies, nothing you can do.I've had my survivors pushed into rooms through windows(once that require buttons to be pressed to get out) so your characters get stuck in rooms that no one can get to.Your units are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You have to tell them everything, and when you tell them things, they don't do. examples. They will run straight into zomibes with mellee weapon equiped, and if they can't get to the spot they are trying to get to, they won't kill the zombies, they will just run in place while they get eaten alive.  You tell them to face a certain way, They turn around to shoot zombies other characters are already killing, then low and behold, they won't turn back around to face the way you told them to face.I could go on but it's the short and sweet, Terrible mechanics, so much is broken, difficulty would be fun if you could actually control your units.

Sometimes you have to run into a building to destroy a MS Paint blob called a ""Heart"" that attracts the zombies so zombies will stop coming. Oh no, but it's not just zombies! The special infected from Left 4 Dead 2 - I mean - the MUTANTS will come and eat individual characters if you send them off alone!

Phew, thought this game might actually get exciting for a moment.Hey, while I'm busy comparing this game to Left 4 Dead 2: Survivor Squad is also missing the writing, characters, decent mapping, advanced strategy, adrenaline-filled horror, and anything from Left 4 Dead that isn't 'shoot all the zombies in this building and then steal all the wood and scraps for modest gains in RPG stats'."

It's not the best, but with a few updates and some hard work it'll probably be one of my goty's. but really, please nerf the jumpers and grabbers, they are overpowered in too many wasy (the jumpers can jump through walls, the grabbers can grab through some walls, and they can drag you through any obstacle, witch is really hard when there's a counter in they way and one survivor is getting dragged into the fog of a blinder while everyone else is flooded with jumpers and walkers. that excat same senerio happned to me just a few days ago while i was on this, i had named my survivors Mark, Sean, Bob, and Wade, and they all died to mostly jumpers and grabbers but th walkers just sped up the process of them dying, also there should be a fast foreward button because half of the time after clearing one building is spent walking over to the next, and so you can make searching things faster. overall, i'd give this a 5.5 out of 10 also, Thank you: THE GAME."

The ""controls"" consist of almost exclusively right clicking, which is, of course, not an attack-move order. You could tell your men to move 2 feet to the left and if there's a zombie in the way, they'll path around it taking damage the entire time.The idea is good but qualitatively it's barely better than a lot of flash games you could play.If it was on sale for two or three dollars, it would be worth but full price was a waste of money.You could of course sink some time in to adjust to the wonky mechanics and probably end up enjoting yourself but it would be a poor time cost to benifit ration.A video game is like a cake. You pay for your cake and then you get to eat it. Buying Survivor Squad is like paying someone to give you cake, and then they give you a napkin instead of a plate and chopstiscks instead of a fork. Yeah you could eat cake with chopsticks, but it's way too much work when this cake isn't particularly good in the first place. Just go to a different bakery.

It starts on a bad foot, as every map you play is poorly lit and at nighttime, the  bad camera angle does the game no favors either. It does not have day rotations and and the view gets annoying the more you play. It tries to cover up how ugly or bare bones it by hiding in the darkness, and while that may work for a short time, you see the same map layout so many times it gets old fast.Even through it says it's random what it has to pick from is so small that every time it feels the same. Combat with melee is mostly useless, yes you can kill silently but the enemy will keep respawning in many maps until you complete a task. That means the more you melee the more you get injured, and that would be fine if there was a better looting system in the game. You never find items of use and you can't trade items, only buy. Nor can you use your items to increase the outposts you build. While you may find blueprints to craft you do not find items such as armor or better weapons, which makes looting a chore rather than fun.The combat controls are frustrating as you are limited to control up to four members. If a zombie gets close to your south point the people in the north will turn and shoot south leaving the zombies in the north to get closer. They do not turn around or have any way to accurately keep their focus fire, in one direction.It becomes a chore of go to map, see same layout and same combat, fight, loot and move on as the game does not respect your time. I can not find myself to recommend this game. Thanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho"

I did not buy the game (it was gifted to me), but I would not have bought it had I researched it prior.The most obvious, glaring problem is the UI and art style. I play roguelike games, so to have a poor UI/art style is a very difficult thing to do in my eyes, but Survivor Squad pulls it off. It looks like a browser flash game from 2005, and it handles just a little better. The UI faces similar issues, it just isn't satisfying to use. I feel like I'm playing a game drawn by a kid with crayons.The gameplay was okay. I killed some zombies, I looted some stuff, I progressed. I guess they are going for ultra realism, as each character can only carry a small amount of items. That would be cool if the crafting system didn't require so many materials. In this aspect, it is very grindy, and not in the MMORPG way, but more in the ""I'm really ♥♥♥♥ing sick of finding nothing in these chests"" way.I don't see this game improving.

Watching your men shoot zombies is very visceral and exciting.You advance through checkpoints on a map, capturing and securing resource nodes in an attempt to exterminate zombies from the face of the earth. You can scavenge new materials, weapons and blueprints from buildings.Many of the buildings repeat very often. A greater variety of layouts would have been really nice, I have only seen four or five constructs so far.Special zombies are extremely dangerous, and can temporarily disable one of your squad, making it necessary to travel in groups of two or more.Weapons and armors seem a little expensive, but it doesn't kill the sense of advancement.Overall, I definitely reccommend this game.

I’ve tried replaying 3 or 4 times but still get stuck.Lets start with the good-It has a great concept and awesome, intense gameplay.-A nice, but improvable skill and level system- The ability to build safe areas that generate materials is cool. Good when you’re stuck in a rut.-the inventory size is a brilliant idea.-nice story line-gadgets and such are pretty darn cool. Turrets and cameras are my favouriteGlitches:-Spitters can spit through glass and grabbers can grab and drag squad members through glass.-There have been times where I cleanse an area only to have it recaptured the next day; before I can advance. 10/10 on the annoying and rage quitting scale.-Sometimes a squad member will prioritise a group of zombies that had been seen and would be easily dealt with by another member rather than the hoard coming at the door. Also when a squad member is attacked by a jumper his buddies either shoot the other zombies before the one that’s pinning him.- I have found certain maps, during a defence round, zombies won’t attack the area you are in and instead stay in certain areas, requiring you to hunt for them, which is quite boring.- exiting a game will save your squad.Ideas to improve the game-diverse personalities and speeds. A range of movement speed, reloading skills and gadget efficiency would be cool. Certain personalities pick up and improve in certain fields.-being able to move non-squad and/or have multiple squads. Moving survivors for defence from town to town as you progress is almost impossible.-WOMEN!-working at a large facility is required for/improves production- implement of buildings such as hospitals, workshops and storage. Hospitals for increased healing, workshops for building or improving gadgets and storage for storing equipment and materials.- Co-operation mode aswell as fighting multiplayer.dispite this i still like and continue to play this game."

Zombies!The controls are very simple and intuitive, altho it took me a little while to get used to right clicking the mouse to move my characters. Even tho it gets a little tight in situations, like when I forget to right click, and end up un-hi-liting my character. My fingers also tend to get confused, which leads to hitting the wrong numeric key, and sending the wrong soldier in the wrong way.This game requires some series micro-management of your team if you want to keep everyone alive. This includes setting a rear guard at times, and especially individual movement of characters. Moving everyone all together will leave your defences wide open, as the survivors will not stop and attack enemies until they have completed their movement. So by individually moving them, it allows the stationary characters a chance to provide covering fire for those in transit.This game is def worth the buy.

They will keep going to where you told them to go no matter what is in the way and wont attack and of the zombies hanging off of them. This means that there is a MASSIVE difficulty spike when you get to the level 2 buildings.The special zombies are an alright idea but are just taken from Left 4 Dead so they don’t seem fresh and are just run-of-the-mill.The spitters are just over powered as they can shoot through walls and any other obstacle. This means that you could be in a building and then there is spitter goo flying through 4 walls and 3 rooms to land directly on one of my team members.The jumpers are basically hunters from L4D so they are as you can expect and mean that splitting up your squad is a bad idea in most situations. This offers a glimmer of hope to an otherwise frustrating game.The crafting is a good idea because it makes you go back to old locations to gather resources that you had missed before. It also means that you can equip your team with better equipment so that they won't die so fast. You do, however, use cloth to make armour. You also use cloth to make bandages. Because of the stupidity of your squad members, you will be making bandages more than you will be making armour.You also have to defend locations if you leave them for too long. I find that this is a good idea because it keeps you on your toes and makes you clear out the areas adjacent. This does mean that your squad will be really badly damaged or killed. This is because they throw hundreds if zombies at you and this is very difficult unless you have built defences to help.Overall this game could be a great game if the problems are either tweaked or sorted out."

In Survivor Squad you control up to 4 members of a squad on missions to eliminate all zombies in an area, exploring and looting as you go about it. You can then craft new weapons and supplies at your bases, which cost those same resources to establish. You spend gas to travel from area to area, and there's a store. The fact that I can tell you everything about the game four sentences says a lot about what you're getting here.-The controls are horrendous. your squad has really little to no AI to speak of. you have to tell them where to move, where to turn, and occasionally where to attack. If they're alone and a zombie sneaks up behind them, they're dead because apparently they didn't hear it a flesh-eating monster running up behind them and think to turn around and shoot it. They only ever turn to shoot something nearby them if a teammate spots is spotting it beside them in their cone of vision that extends about four yards in front of their face, because hooray near-sightedness. And they also don't start shooting until the enemy is halfway into their cone of vision. Making guns nearly-useless, due to the fact that they also refuse to reload by themselves. They'd rather stand still and get eaten than reload. No, YOU have to select them and hit R manually, or they're ♥♥♥♥ed. You also cannot tell them to turn and face a new direction without moving first. Which is a hell of a ♥♥♥♥ing hassle.-The ""Story"" is pathetic. After going easy on you for the first few levels, prepare for story-based missions where you have to help some guy, or retrieve some item, while pushing against an UNLIMITED tide of zombies until you accomplish your goal, with your UNLIMITED ammo, where enemies charge you from all directions, leaving you finding your squad walking back to back a few feet at a time in what is the most boring mission layout I have ever seen in a game.-The voice ac- oh wait, there was no voice acting. Or maybe there was and it was so bad I didn't remember it. I'm going to stand by saying there was no voice acting. Leaving you to have to actually READ things others are saying while your squad is being eaten alive because you forgot to check the bottom of the screen to see if they were out of ammo and needing you to hold their and and hit R.I'd tell you everything else that's wrong with this game but there is literally nothing else to criticize, the game is too small to have anything else to criticize. At least it has two other game modes, survival and sandbox. Sandbox being essentially story mode but without the story-driven ♥♥♥♥ missions, but it also has no ending as well. Just repetitive gameplay until you die or get bored.4/10. If I had no other games available, maybe I could push myself to finish the story mode at least, but thankfully, I do have other games available, and if you do too, do yourself a favor. Steer clear so far of this game that you forget it exists."

It would have been nice to see some 'special' zombie types that weren't literally just ripped from Left 4 Dead too, as much to show that there had at least been some kind of original thought gone into it.All in all, it's probably about right for its price - it's an enjoyable little time-killer, but most people will probably only get 10 or so hours out of it before they get bored.Fun to play?: YesAny game-breaking issues?: NoWorth the price of admission?: Yes"

I really like the concept as well, crawling your way through a zombie infested city and managing your left-for-dead style squad at every turn.But this game is broken and unwinable.I've tried to win twice.  On my first play, I got in a scenario where I could not take and hold a node because it would get immediately recaptured by the zombies in the time it took for my guys to return from base after capturing (a return which was mandatory).  On my second play, I wisely set up a defensive ring so that I wouldn't have to deal with this.  Then, I got stuck in an Endless Loop of defending nodes, because the time it takes to defend on node was enough for another to get attacked.Devs, I like your gameplay, but this is ridiculous.  There's no reason I should get game-breaking bugs on my first two playthroughs.  Do some playtesting next time."

I picked it up at a significant discount for something like $0.99 a while back, and I enjoyed the gameplay for a while, but (and I stress this) it is NOT worth more than I paid for it.The game is put together decently, but the unity-esque graphics are distressing (unless you only paid a dollar for the game) and the lack of immersion (I don't know how else to expres that I didn't care about whether the survivors survived or not) make it hard to like the game, despite the mechanics being pretty decent overall.In short, if it goes on sale for like a dollar, and you want a quick and decent squad-based survival game, go for it. You might like it. Otherwise, with all due respect to the developer, save your money."

Dev, if you're still working on this game, add Co-Op!And more than 1 car!And fortifications for your bases and more base-related things like research, build and repair!It's a simple, fun, zombie game where you control up to 4 squad members and clear out zones on your way to the fabled 'scientists working on a cure' much like has been shown in recent games and TV shows, (Walking Dead, Dying Light, etc.)It has some elements of x-com in that you manage resources and recruits to send out on missions, but there's almost no advantage to training multiple squads. The infrequent attacks on your bases only serve to kill them without damaging your supplies and food supplies vs inactive squad members makes you want to rescue people even less.The price was right, 91% off at the time making it 88 cents after tax. I've put more in quarters into arcade games with less play time.  The 9 dollar price tag would be worthwhile if it only had co-op."

I might chalk up $3 for it, but higher than that and I'd have to have very little time on my hands or the steam game market is flooded with Pewdiepie bait.Although it is fun. I hate how it forces you to go into harder areas before you're ready, though. And there isn't any actual AI.What this means is:-No melee if they're not selected for melee...-They'll shoot zombies farther away from them and just keep getting rekt.-Tedious searching..-There should be an option next to the icons that allow for ""Search Building"" or ""Defend (survivor)"". Just a suggestion.-The group is pretty much one survivor if that survivor had 4 bodies and 8 hands until all the zombies are dealt with.-They will die when a spitter appears because they're too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get out of the acid.However, it is fun. The randomly generated map kinda pisses me off when I don't have nodes to fights and I'm forced with fighting a danger level higher than I can do. But it's... fun. Worth the 80 cents I paid.Devs should seriously implement a few things for it to be worth 9 dollars."
