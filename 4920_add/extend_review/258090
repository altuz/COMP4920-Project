The character design is excellent and the music is great and the storyline and dialog is very well written. It’s not the sort of game you spend 4 hours a day playing, it leans more to the casual “waiting between college classes” side of gaming. Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of youkai (妖怪)."

It's a wonderful combination of a RPG and a Visual Novel, that has you play a female role and save her home. I have yet to finish it, which demonstrates the complexity of the plot and how long it is. As I've mentioned in a previous review, I love RPGs that get me hooked on the story and VNs with more than one ending. This game has BOTH. Not only does it have both, it has side quests left, right and centre. Not only that, it has tons of achievements, some to do with the story, some not and an achievement for finding all of the endings.My only gripe with this game, is the grinding. Which is what's currently holding me up in the game play."

The storytelling is generic albeit interesting with a unique flare to it which ties into the battle system....and here is where it loses points....how do I even describe it...you do series of actions against monsters until you get them to the point where you can  name them and then defeat them....Sounds obtuse? Well it is, and although I applaud it for trying something different I honestly can't see who this is targeted at....even at a glance of other reviews....few if any praise the battle system for anything beyond its uniqueness, and frankly when a games core mechanic is a  meh or pass feature, the same should be said for the game.

The story, the music, the artwork, the combat system combining puzzle solving elements as well as quick reaction timing... I don't know where to start!The story is much deeper than it first appears on the surface, the characters are all pretty cool--from the Gokon sword weilding heroine Hanabusa, to her foxy companion Komiya and all the gods in between.The artwork is very simple but surprisingly detailed, much like the paintings created in Japan's past--not quite as epic as Okami's art, but not bad for a still picture RPG!I love the music, though it may get repetitive for some people, as it tends to loop quite often--especially in the longer battles.The combat is just as I described it: puzzle solving combined with split second reactions of the player to beat the living tar out of TONS of demon beasties called Tsukumogami and the forces of darkness.The mythology of ancient Japan, artwork harkening back to the paintings of the time, a really neat combat system equals--to me--a pretty cool game! Give it a try!One note: SAVE OFTEN! Sometimes, the game crashes in battle, completely freezing up for... I dunno, some reason I don't know of.

,Recommended,258090,10502682,"Posted: 17 June, 2014",all,Potatti,"To start with, this game is NOT FOR EVERYONE, far from it. You SHOULD try out the demo before buying it.The game is about a swords(wo)man, Hanabusa, who fights evil spirits on her journey to restore a blade that is imbues with powers from differents gods and ultimately find out the source for the mass of spirits that have been rampaging lately. How the fighting happens is quite a different aproach from what you'd expect and also is the catch of the game.When you fight the spirits, you will find out that they are practically invincible to your attacks, by attacking you'll gather energy that you can use to not actually damage the spirits, but to gather information about the spirit you are facing. What do you do with the information then? You'll have to find out the spirits actual form in order to be able to defeat it.Sounds crazy all right.When you enter combat you will have no idea what you are facing, apart from the knowledge of ""this zone has these and those"",  you start off with a round of attacks, hopefully filling up your energy (or gem as the game calls them), when it's filled, you then spend it to gather info, the information gained will be hints about what the actual form of the spirit is, when you think you have enought information you can try to name the spirit, thus revealing the true form, and only then your attacks will start hurting the spirit. Naturally, you can skip the information gathering and just throw guesses, usually the spirits do a rather mean counter attack if you try to call them out and are wrong.All this is done with simple controls, you either atttack, or defend, both gather energy for their respective gems, during the action round, you'll have the chance to deflect attacks from the monster and counter attack, in a reaction game fashion.It gets repetive, fast, no doubt about that, but the challenge and fun is the little guessing game you have to do with the spirits. Eventually that will get to you too, and you wish it would be easier and faster, well luck is with you! Not too far into the game you actually will be able to start boosting numerous aspects of the fights, making them a ton smoother at which point the game really starts to slowly turn towards a more story telling type of a game with some action as the side dish.Thanks to the cast of quite charming characters, it's not a bad thing at all.Really, play the demo if you are curious, some will hate it, some will love it. I personally find it quite an entertaining experience. Oh and remember to save often if you end up getting the game, I've had a couple crashes when facing certain spirits and there are no autosaves.Pros+Loveable characters+Story+Soundtrack+Guessing the spirits can prove to be great fun for some+Original audioCons-Repetive gameplay-Soundtrack (too much is too much, no matter if you like the music or not)-English audio made me want to tear my ears off-No autosaves of anykind."

Hanabusa sets out on a quest for vengeance and revenge guided by a spiritual white fox to cleanse the world of the Tsukumogami using the Gokon Sword.The gameplay is very unique as well, you won't be able to damage your opponent unless you figure out what you're fighting.

After every sixth hit, you can use that special ability to get a hint to try to figure out what the Tsukomogami is. And after every sixth block, you can use the second special ability to type-in the correct everyday object which you the Tsukomogami you're fighting is. If you guess correctly, the dark misty fog/shroud will be lifted, and you'll be able to damage and successfully kill the Tsukomogami.

,Recommended,258090,10855855,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,Vorthod,"I recommend this game**I would like to mention that I LOVE Japan. The culture, the history, the games, the art style, everything. Therefore I am positive that my enjoyment of the game is incredibly biased. I can easily see someone getting frustrated because they have no idea what a Torii is and have to figure it out from process of elimination (or google search if they find the book that lists potential spirits in the area ahead of time).So here are the basics (limited to the first few minutes of the game to avoid spoilers) skip ahead a couple of paragraphs if you know how to play the game. This game features Tsukumogami, everyday objects that have been possessed and cause trouble. Normal people are unable to even discern the form of these Tsukumogami and instead see nothing but a hovering purple cloud. The main character, Hanabusa, hates Tsukumogami and has been training to fight them, but it is not until she aquires a holy, jewel-encrusted sword that she is able to fight them. The first two (of five) jewels are able to provide hints as to a Tsukumogami's identity and allow Hanabusa to attempt to guess what she is fighting, respectively. With this weapon in hand, she sets out to defeat the spirits.The combat system is pretty simple (not to mention extremely easy). Hanabusa can choose to attack or defend, each action will go off three times (swing three times, or hold your sword up three times). at any point during those three actions, your opponent may attack you, at which point you must hit the defend key by reflex or you will be damaged, after you do hit the defend key, you will take no damage and have a chance to hit the attack key for a free counterattack. You may have noticed in that description that if you are able to block every single attack made by the enemy, you should be pretty much invincible if you have decent reflexes, right? That statement is entirely true with only one exception: later bosses can unleash ""Powerful"" attacks that are unblockable if you are using the attack command at that time. however, it is possible to have every one of your actions be ""defend"" and rely on counterattacking and later-game abilities for your damage, so this is not too bad.Attacking and defending (this includes reaction blocks and counterattacks) will fill up different gem gagues. attacking will fill up what i will call the hint gauge, defending will fill up the reveal gauge. for example, let's say I get into a battle with a Tsukumogami. This Tsukumogami will be shrouded in clouds so i cannot damage it. I attack it a few times so that i can use the hint gem. after three usages of the hint gem let's say I have seen the following hints: ""sweeping"" ""OO"" and ""dust."" Lowercase hints describe the object's form or usage while capital letters are part of the object's name. therefore, i need to think of what kind of object is related to sweeping and dust and has the letter combination ""OO"" in it's name. the answer is a broom. therefore I block until my other gem (the reveal one) is ready, use it, and type the word ""broom"" into the prompt. at this point, the spirit's form is revealed (assuming i was correct) and my attacks can damage the tsukumogami. Tsukumogami don't change their attack behaviors when revealed, so from here there isn't really anything special to note besides that some Tsukumogami can heal a bit when their now-visible health gauge dropsNow for the actual review. The combat system is repetitive, slow, and easy as hell. After the first mission, i've never been hit by any basic attacks unless i was trying to focus on two different computer windows at once. Now, you *can* get some upgrades that improve each of the gems in your sword, and I absolutely love getting six hints every single time i use the hint gem as it makes combat go SO much faster. Also, later on you can capture and utilize the skills of Tsukumogami that you battle and this can also help you by doing things like increasing your damage and healing you over time so that you can go fight a boss 15 levels above you and still not worry about their huge defense or their power attacks. in the end, combat is still a bit repetitive and still very easy, but as you play the game and get some upgrades, it does speed up a bit to tolerable levels.As for the music in the game. The map screens usually play slow, unobtrusive tracks. Nothing annoying, but nothing i would ask for a soundtrack to listen to. The battles on the other hand are a different story, while the boss track isn't bad, the basic battle theme is amazing, upbeat, and just fun to listen to. Even though it is the only track for basic battles, i still haven't grown tired of it.The story is pretty simple, but it tends to stretch itself out a bit. Each task ends up having it's own area all to itself, so the story can get really slow at points. However, I did find myself intrigued by the story itself. Who is behind this strange increase in Tsukumogami attacks? What became of Hanabusa's parents in the prologue? What if the god who allowed Hanabusa to carry the sword discards her and finds a new weilder? Speculating on how exactly the story will handle these elements is quite fun and I look forward to each big mission so that i can get some more pieces to the puzzle. My only issue with the story is that the antagonist group does quite a lot to put the Gokon Sword (the one we weild) completely out of commission, yet almost never sends anyone dauntingly powerful to destroy the weilder herself, even when she goes around freeing all the imprisoned deities who helped to forge the sword in the first place. All they do is cause some trouble with a Tsukumogami related to the area in question and wait for us to show up, so...yeah i can't say the villains are too impressive.One miscellaneous-yet-important thing to note is that this program is not stable. You should pretty much never open the save menu with the keyboard shortcut (Z on the map screen) and you should save often just in case your game glitches during a fight. I have no idea why a game this simple can have such big problems with it's runtime, but they exist so you should be aware of them. SAVE OFTEN JUST IN CASE!to sum up: 1) i can easily see people getting bored from the combat system 2) I LOVE the battle track and have it stuck in my head even as i write this 3) the story moves slowly, but I do enjoy progressing it just to get a few more pieces to the puzzle, and 4) It's not stable despite a simple design. however, as a fifth point, if you have no interest in Japanese culture, this game is sure to be frustrating. small things like getting ""tea"" as a hint instead of, say, ""eggs"" when fighting a whisk can probably stack up to a rather annoying problem if you repeatedly are given hints that would mislead people thinking in a western mindset.bottom line: If you like Japan and short word puzzles, give the game a shot. If you prefer quick action and cultural references from your own country, you may want to pick up something else."
