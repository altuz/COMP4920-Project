Yes, I got a good experience, playing and learning different characters, their advantages. This helps me to know the game, its rules. But after some games, this solo adventure starts to bother me. Quests quite frankly aren't interesting. Often you need to get to some place or monster, and you roll dice one by one until you get exactly you need (Sometimes I spent more than 20-25 turns just only to be on the same space as my quest's task). I don't persuade to buy Talisman, but don't waste money, buy original Talisman: Digital Edition, where you get better experience, fun and enjoyment playing with friends or bots. There you will not only roll dices, but also think about your next steps."

Consider this to be a tutorial to the extreme, enough to be able to sell it seperately.I consider it more of an occasional distraction, probably not one of those games that you feel like playing for hours on end...but one of those that you 'pull off of the shelf' here and there.After playing Talisman Digital Edition, I will say that I did miss the quests. Ultimately, it could be cool to blend the two and introduce individual quests into the Digital Edition.It seems that, at the least, Prologue will either be a quick distraction, or it will be one of those that you will enjoy here and there. (Obviously there is the possibility that it may just 'click' and it is played to completion).In other words, for the price ... not too bad.  I enjoyed it so far, but for me it is here and there.  It would seem hard to go wrong if you can get it in a bundle or, as currently under a couple bucks. (I'm buying a couple extra as gifts ... can't go too wrong for that price and maybe they will go for the Digital Edition and we can do multiplayer...)"

( watch a few youtube vids on the game, & get a feel for the rules etc)3. if you feel that this is your sort of game, then purchase the prologue.This is in main a tutorial , dont worry to much about counting moves, just enjoy the ride that is talismam.There are more than 50 quests, and the pros of this are you will get to really understand about how to build your chosen characters , get a taste of what possible rewards and pitfalls await you within the adventure card deck,which must be turned after every move and finally which squares of the board not to go to.This is why its a must buy for anyone thats new to talisman.(at time of review it was not on sale ) .so at this point weve spent less than the price of a costa coffee & muffin (£7)im old skool and this feels like your playing a adventure story novel, the dice will make or break you.but im enjoying every minute playing and as i select every adventure card or spell card you will be like a kid opening a present.for the price you get a lot of fun for your bucks.you dont have to dig deep and buy all the expansions right away.theres plenty here to keep you going, for now.i give prologue  a beast slaying, spell casting  8/10The best way to find your gaming legs , which will only add to you enjoying the multiplayer game even more."

Well, except some, which task you with; get to the centre of the board. Most are just; buy a sword, kill something, go get healed. Quest complete.There are some that are more interesting, like rescuing a princess and returning her to the castle... But the game doesn't go far enough with these tasks, nor is there enough of them.Also starting from scratch each time you play means re-treading so much ground they're just not that much fun to play after the first time.The gameplay loop is essentially; roll a dice, land on a square and do what it tells you to, usually draw some cards. The cards will have items, monsters or events... And that's it. There's not some opposing force acting against you, or for you to outwit, the cards are the only thing that affect the game.Levelling up your character is a fairly trivial affair; beat enemies that you take as trophies, if you have trophies whose corresponding trait adds up to 7 or more, you can exchange them for a level. Equipment cards can also increase your stats... Which means all too quickly you become the most powerful being on the board. Ultimately there just isn't really any difficulty to the game.That's where the event cards come in so you can randomly be reduced down to something that the enemies actually have a chance at killing...The funniest thing is that you can lose a turn... Which just means the turn counter increases by two. All I can gather is that the game rates you upon completion of the quest and I assume it just comes down to the amount of turns taken...I can see it being useful to learn the ruleset, and perhaps that's where the ""prologue"" part of the name comes from... But the mechanics aren't exactly difficult, or incredibly deep that they'd require such a primer.Annoyingly there is another version of the game released that actually has multiplayer... Which begs the question; why this version still exists… They say it focuses on the single player experience... But really, there isn't much to that experience. In so much that I can't imagine why someone who opt for this one over the other.I did enjoy my first game enough, but then when I went to play a second, even playing as a different character, I was almost instantly bored."

It's MMO grinding except the quests don't actually give you anything of value except achievements. I find that very, very cheap of the devs and outright offensive, really. Instead of giving something of value they just deliver grindy content.The value is for people who are really into the game, like me, who want to examine different strategies. I'm really good at the game as it is, having beaten everyone and their brother on my real life gameboard, but when I want to reassure myself I load up a random character class and spend an hour leveling it in this game until I can tapdance through victory. That gets old really fast, though, and there isn't much left for me to learn.The Prologue is simply a very light story to introduce you to the grinding. It pretends that each character has a cool backstory.Would be more fun if it had more going on than achievements for playing it over and over."

The graphics are crude, low quality, ""hand painted"" look and appear worse due to the interface being clunky and slow; from the menu system through to the in-game icons with no tool-tips or highlights for possible actions. The tiny golden glow around the right-menu icons barely acts as a highlight and does nothing to attract the eye.This certainly doesn't have any of the good design and eye-candy polish of other Games Workshop titles and looks to have been a cheap out-sourced project. There is no reason for this single-player only version to have not been built-into the other multi-player version instead of making them separate titles. It gives me the impression of a quick money grab from a small studio with no real love or basic interest in the Talisman games.

That is what worked for me - learning the game via the Prologue edition, totally getting into the full game along with the expansions, and then also adding the Talisman Board game along with the Reaper and Frostmarch expansins to my board game library. For me Prologue was well worth  the modest price.Note: This is/was one of the Steam products with the Data Execution Prevention BS - a real major bummer . This issue, although eventually resolved, resulted in reconsideration of whether this amount of stress was worth sticking with STEAM.

Then this came out, along with Talisman: Digital Edition, and I must say I reccomend them both, for different reasons. You see in Talisman: Digital Edition you get to play online or off and are up against up to 3 other human/AI players, it is fun and is a true original edition of Talisman(Or at least from what I read), but this one is different, you see in this one you play all by yourself, and you are on some kind of a adventure ranging from getting the crown of control in the magical quest, to something as simple as  finding a cave for the Troll(Harder then it sounds actually especially with the turn limit of 20) This has way more of a D&D feel to it then the normal version because of these quests, since your not just playing as a random character through one quest anymore,you can take a character through something of a small campaign of 6 total quests, and while you do not get to keep your items, or stats from game to game, it adds a certain level of interest and intrigue to these characters that the original lacks. Of course this is also a problem with this game too, you see apparently they decided to add some new characters in there, but then wasted some of their potential by not giving them their own campaigns and more or less just gave them the magical quest. (The one for the crown of control) These include the Vampire Hunter, Amazon, Minotaur, Leprechaun, Sprite, Sage etc. if you buy this you will know them, put this with the unfortunate circumstance that it does not appear that they will update, or give this a expansion to give these characters their own campaigns and it leads to a lot of wasted potential, in addition it would be great if they not only did this but came out with exapnsions for other characters as well, and put a nice campaign with them as well, (The Knight for instance). and while I will admit this is not Talisman proper, both this version and the Digital Edition has their places. This is for the fams that like the idea of different stories, and quests to do with the characters and don't mind going solo, where the other is for the fans of the game that really don't care about that. Overall a excellent game and well worth the purchase.Graphics: The board looks great, the artwork is nice, it is a step down on somethings from the digital edition, but the graphics are still good enough to please any fan, or anyone curious. 8/10Controls: Simple to control and fast and responsive. 10/10Value: I set my price for games at about 2 bucks per hour of play time I get out of them. I have already got the full 6.99 plus out of this and I am not even close to completing (much less mastering) all the quests. So yeah well worth it. 10/10Achievements: What are those? LOL, no seriously though, other then cards I have not noticed any. Not that there is any scroe for this, but if your a achievement hog, this might not be the game for you.Fun Factor: This of course will vary by person, or sometimes how long a particular quest takes(It can be brutal) but overall I give it a 8/10  It's not perfect, but it is fun and interesting.In the end: If you are just a fan of Talisman the game and don't care so much for additional quests, maybe you would consider them mini campaigns/side quests, then this might not be the game for you. If you love Talisman and are not afraid to try something different with the game, you may want to check this out, if your a fan of adventure boardgames and don't mind going solo, go for both this and the digital edition.

I have only played the original Crown of Command one, because I don't see any choices for the end quest yet, but still... possibilities. Anyway, this is a single player only version of the game, and because it's faithful to the original, it includes turn loss cards and effects, which have no meaning in single player.

For most of the classes, this adaptation tasks you with goals that are meant to teach you how to use their unique abilities and the general game mechanics. It's well-done and the mechanics are solid.The actual board game or a full multiplayer implementation would probably be better and this feels more like a demo or proof of concept. There's just not that much to do and, after you very quickly pick up the simple mechanics, the rest is repetition.

I've been playing the tabletop version of Talisman sinse the mid-80's and still play the current 4th edition rules on a regular basis with friends and family and as far as a solo experience with Talisman goes you can't beat this game. A lot of modern tabletop games offer solo playability but aside from a few clunky rules you can find online Talisman doesn't really lend itself to solo play. Until now that is. While Talisman:Prologue has been patched and newer characters have been added the core original characters each have several custom quests that loosely combine into a ""campaign"" and it's these missions which offer the most originality and variety in the game. So much so that if I ever did want to play my Tabletop version of the game solo I'd use one of those quests. But luckily this ""video game"" version exists so I don't have to pull out the box and go through all the hastle of setting it up and playing.While Talisman has fairly easy rules it can be a bit difficult for people who don't have a great deal of experience with these types of board games but Talisman:Prolouge includes an excellent tutorial mode that can be turned on and off at the players will. By playing the first series of quests for the various characters new players can get pretty comfortable with the rules fairly quickly. I'd reccoment this to any gamer looking for a nice, casual bord game experience. The only down side is the lack of any kind of save function. Since most games of T:P can be finished anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes this isn't too big a deal."

,Recommended,258200,9275284,"Posted: 26 February, 2014",all,Tuong,"Talisman Prologue is an adaptation of the classic fantasy board game Talisman by Games Workshop. This version focuses on single player experience.An epic tale of dice rolling and card drawing takes you on a quest throughout the land to rescue Princesses, slay Dragons and recover lost artefacts. Play through over 50 quests using the Talisman board game rules, and learn the special abilities of all of the characters.It's important to note that this is NOT a multiplayer game based on Talisman, this is a reworking of the rule-set to allow solo players to experience Talisman in a different way."

I like the fact it gives you some goals and a mini-story as you play the main characters from the full Talisman game.  Another nice touch is being able to play any new characters you unlock in the full game if you have that too.Only downside is when you get a spell you can only cast on another player, as you are the only player.  It would be good if these were removed from the pack in the prologue."
