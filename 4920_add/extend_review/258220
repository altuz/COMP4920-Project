If you're expecting something like Fable, Castlevania or whatnot, well... This is not the game you're looking for.If you match both the critearias listed above, you're good to go.Pros:***Customization system (equipement and skill trees). Weapons and armors have a cosmetic effect on the characters which is a plus.***Ability to switch between characters at will (with a small cooldown). The two characters have different gameplay and can do have separate skill trees, skill points and inventory.***The graphics aren't fantastic but they are FAR from ugly.***Fixed camera doesn't impair the gameplay (exception : see below, in ""Cons"" section)***Supports local coop multiplayer***Fun to playCons:***I needed 5 hours to complete the game,howlongtobeat.comsays 4 hours.

Soon enough I was given an opportunity to experience that. Blood Knights is one of those vamphyric games that I like. Running along and killing bad guys, monsters, warewolves sure is fun. And it is in this game. What is more, graphics are really juicy, and beautiful. But when it comes to the story itself it is as shallow as a hole dug by a child in a sand with a little spatula. Come on guys, you could have done better! It takes about 4 hours to finish this game on medium level of difficulty. At this rate heroes have best equipement and burst through waves of enemies without sweat. Dear player, a fan of vampyric games,  if you are reading this, please mind that it would be better if you spend your money firstly on LEGACY OF KAIN series and then come back for BLOOD KNIGHTS.

I can see why so many people puts negative reviews but if your expectation is not much it is a good game. Typical Kalypso game with two main characters that you can switch in between. Do not expect something like Dragon's Age or Skyrim and you will enjoy it.

,Recommended,258220,10592603,"Posted: 20 June, 2014",all,LoveJesusHateTheGovernment,"Wow. I'm really baffled reading all of the negative reviews this game got. Maybe I'm just easier to please than most people but I absolutely loved this game! It was a real gem. I was fortunate enough to get this on the steam summer sale for three dollars, but after playing it, I think it's worth the full price tag. From what I can gather reading the negative reviews, the majority of complaints seem to be that it's linear, a poor pc port of a console game, doesn't have AAA graphics, and poor voice acting. Other complaints are repetitive combat, boring musical score and poor story. These last three I strongly disagree with, and I thought the graphics were pretty good for a $15.00 title. First of all, I loved the story which revolved around a world where humans and vampires are at war for dominance of the planet. Some spell forges the souls of two enemies: your character, (a male human) and a female vampire, (admittedly this is never explained but it's supposed to help the humans turn the tide of the war somehow). They are stuck with each other and have to keep each other alive because if one dies, the other does too. Well, your character gets turned in the first chapter of the game, so now you are a vampire also, as well as your companion. I very much liked the dialogue and chemistry between the two main characters, which I thought was pretty entertaining. The combat was very fun. If you are anything like me, you will probably use the male, (former human) 70's percent of the time because he uses melee attacks which I find to be a lot more fun. However, you will find yourself relying on the female (vampire's) ranged attacks  more as the game progresses and the enemies get stronger. I found the combat to be very fun and fluid, and didn't get boring to me at all. I liked the two main characters and the story, which unfolded more and more as the game progressed, with an interesting turn at the end. The final villain, (who is not introduced until fairly late in the game) was very VERY cool, not just as a final boss, but as a character as well, and is accompanied by an awesome musical score during the final battle. It is my favorite musical score in the game! Sadly, my copy of the game did not come with the soundtrack. I would have liked to have put it on my i-Pod.  The aesthetics of the game were very visual rich, (if you read any of my other reviews, you will see that aesthetics are VERY important to me). I especially liked Noah's pass and the second to last level, which has the ruins of Noah's ark mounted in the sky on top of a mountain peak.  The controls were very easy to pick up on. I normally hate playing rpgs with controllers, perfecting a mouse and keyboard, but this game was incredibly easy to play with a controller. This is probably because it's not really an rpg. It is primarily an action, hack-n-slash, with only the bare minimum elements of an rpg included, (basically leveling up and earning gold for better equipment). There is also skills to be learned as your character gets stronger, but they are very basic skills. This game is fantastic for what it is: a very linear action hack-n-slash with a cool story and mediocre voice acting. The length of the game is roughly 7 to 8 hours on normal difficulty. This was just perfect. It told a neat sci-fi/fantasy story without being dragged out. If this has been longer, it might have started to drag out a bit. Here is some advice for anyone playing for the first time. Don't buy anything from the trader. All equipment you need can be found during the quest. Save all gold you collect until about 3/4 the way through and then buy the bada$$ sword called ""SATAN'S JUSTICE!!"" ...best name for a sword ever! LOL! I really get a kick out of that. I guess I never really thought of Satan as caring too much about justice.The only two flaws I can really think to say about this game is that you can't control the camera angle. But don't worry, it's not bad and the camera keeps focused on the action.......most of the time. (There was I think two times where the camera angle obstructed my character's path that I can remember). But don't worry, it's not as bad as other games like Garshasp, where the lack of control of the camera angle took some serious getting used to. Also, the platforming can be a bit annoying, but fortunately there isn't that much of it. Overall, I really liked this game a lot. It does not deserve the negativity that some people give it. I think people buy a game like this expecting the quality of a sixty dollar, AAA title and get disappointed, (I'm only speculating. I honestly don't know why it's gotten so much negativity.)  I hope a sequel is made."

Still, the game was fun to play. Maybe a bit easy even playing it on hard. History, voice acting and music are not bad, but neither are something that deserve to be remembered though.

,Recommended,258220,35468604,Posted: 4 October,all,DINNYFORST,"Developed by Deck13 Interactive (Released on Nov 2013)Blood Knights is good example of hack-n-slash RPG with interesting settings, but somehow fail to deliver full potential RPG experience to the audience. Here's the breakdown---------------------------------------------------------Presentation:• Interesting fictional storyline set in world at war between humans and vampires with solid background.• Consistent story pacing, but decent and linear main storyline.• Good variety of world and detailed environment, but filled with uninspired and repetitive designs to support gameplay.• Some cliché and cheesy dialogues, few character development, lack of strong side characters which are forgotten.• Lip sync issue and awkward eye contract for some characters in cutscene.• Great soundtracks and ambient musics.---------------------------------------------------------Gameplay:• Mindless and arcadey hack-n-slash combat, it’s fun and well entertained, but lack of depth and complexity. Most boss fight you can keep firing crossbow and it’s done.• Fluid swap character mechanics (Melee / Range). Each character has different set of skills and playstyles.• Character progression by defeating enemies. Skill-point upgrade system.• You upgrade attributes and stats from collecting hidden seals and loots. The more you progress, the better gears you find in chest.• Gear system is very engaging and well in-game presentation. The problem is best weapons from trader are the same where you can easily obtain from end-game. Eliminate the point of progression reward.• The level design doesn’t emphasize the variety of gameplay in both combat and puzzle due to very linear and tight area. In term of RPG, it lacks of level exploration and side quest.• Dialogue option has no real impact to main story beside change of some character attitudes and achievement.• The game has fixed camera angle and rotation. It could be bit wonky in platforming section because the game doesn’t give you clear indicator where character facing to. Fortunately, checkpoint can be saved over as many as you want.---------------------------------------------------------Performance:• Responsive keyboard controls• Minor graphical and clipping issue on some levels• Solid and stable performance, experience no single crash and frame-rate issue---------------------------------------------------------I personally love the story and mythology of vampire of Blood Knights. The game has potential to become great action RPG, but it lacks of polished features to support RPG elements. It’s very short experience (3-4 hours), but still fun game if you don’t take any mechanics seriously. Only recommend it on sale"

Bought it for %50 it took something like 6 hours to play through. I think that it is a short but good game.Played only single player with keyboard and mouse.Changeable controls would be better but it was still quite playable with the fixed key setup.It didn’t crash a single time. Sure there is a lot of potential to improve it, but this is always the case. In the time you play the campaign it will rarely happen that you think, well that should have been made different / better.For example the “fixed” camera can sometimes be a small handicap. Or you get new armors and weapons really fast in the beginning and to the end you get far less. (There are only three kinds of armor designs per character so you will get old designs with better stats later...)"

There's a very basic save the world plot which drives you forward, but it's not all that interesting. It does what it needs to do (serve as a reason to go from area to area) and no more.There's a nice array of enemies which require different tactics to defeat, and some fun bosses.In all honesty, the only thing I didn't enjoy were the short platforming sections - simply because it was so easy to miss and fall to your death. Luckily, checkpoints can be found frequently, and you can revist them to update your save; as well as visit the trader.I played this with an Xbox 360 controller and it worked fine. No idea what it's like with a mouse and keyboard. Don't want to think about it.One strange thing which kept happening to me, was things looked like they were stuttering or lagging, but weren't. It's really weird and difficult to explain. It didn't affect gameplay in any way, it just looked like character animations were a bit stuttery - it could mainly be seen during cutscenes. However, like I said, it never influenced gameplay in the slightest; button input and commands were fluid and everything was responsive.A shame the game wasn't more fleshed out.I recommend it to people who enjoy loot driven rpgs, similar to Diablo, but who want to play as a blood drinking vampire."

Sometimes, when you go out of range of enemy, they retreat to their original position. But as they are retreating, you attack them(with range weapon), they will come back and attack you.   And you just adjust the distance between the enemies and you.  Once you get to the right distance(sweet spot), the AI don't know if they should retreat or attack, so they will keep turning back and forward, and now you can keep attacking them without worrying them attacking you.One thing that I really didn't like about this game is the camera angles, it gets annoying when you accidentally jump off ledges because of bad camera angle.  As for other aspects of the game, like soundtrack, voice acting, and graphics, I have no complains, pretty mediocre stuff, but good enough for me.One of the best thing in this game is the ability to switch between characters; being able to switch between range and melee characters make the gameplay much more fun and interesting.  But what I love most about this game is the characters and their interaction; more specifically, their cheesy dialogue, really funny.  It's just what I expect from game like this.  I mean, who doesn't like a game with vampire story lines, even if it is a cheesy one.I know, it seems like I wrote bunch of bad things about this game but at the end recommend it(I should really stop doing that, maybe that's why my reviews get lots of not helpful votes, lol).  Well, when I think about it, I really want a sequel of this game(as long as it's not worse than this).  I want the same characters with cheesy dialogue and the mindless hack and slash(with exploitable AI bug). It was a fun game nonetheless despite all the flaws."

It sells for a ""budget"" price but it is really a well-made game.  The gameplay hook is that you switch between two characters on the fly, a ranged character and a sword fighting character.  They both play well and add variety in the single player campaign.Graphically the game is pretty, the gameplay itself is smooth and you travel to the typical medieval locales and they all look good.  The character models are solid and all of the equipment and weapons you find reflect visually on your characters.  The cut scenes look nice, a little plain but they work, the ladies look like a teenage boys idea of fantasy women but it worked for me.  The voice acting is a bit wooden at times however the action sounds really add to the immersion, the music never gets repetitive.Story wise its vampires vs the church, you do have some dialog decisions but nothing that really changes the outcome of the game, but it still gives you a chance to leave your mark on the adventure.  The game is a bit short at only 6 hours but for the price it’s fair.  My only complaint is the camera is fixed, this never hampered gameplay for me, but in 2014 not having a camera to move around is really strange, I’m guising this is where the “low budget"" came into play.  Overall Blood Knights was a fun if short adventure, and I enjoyed my time battling the vampires and undead of ancient Rome.  As they say, when in Rome turn into a vampire and hunt other vampires, the undead and pompous romans, or something like that."

And that happened a couple of times in an other level too.The dialogue gets on your nerves sometimes. The fighting is ok i guess. The AI however is as dumb as an ox.No, Deck13 didn't do a good job this time.

Let's get to why you shouldn't buy it unless you have a soft spot for crummy games. It's not worth the $15.1. Terrible controls in terms of platforming. I know I'm terrible at platforming to begin with, but I found myself struggling with jumps that should have been baby town frolics. I had to use Jeremy for all the jumps because it seemed like the cursor for aiming Alysa's crossbows interferred with the direction your charcter would actually jump in, regardless of WASD.2. Voice acting was off. It didn't feel intergrated with the game at all, like the script was read off in awkward monotone by actors who had just woken up. I know vampires are best portrayed as emotionless, but jeez.3. It's actually a very short game. Other than interuptions by crashing, it didn't take me but a few hours to beat it.4. Armor design rotation. In any rpg some fun is derived from all the different designs of armor appearances. There were like four per character that were just cycled through with better stats.5. Almost a Capcom camera issue. I say almost because I didn't really have much of a problem with it due to a love for the Resident Evil titles, but I could see where camera angles interferred with gameplay. Particularily with spotting and object that was required to be triggered but out of sight.I sort of expected a little better from Deck13. Ventica and Jack Keane got me to this game, but sadly I felt like there should have been more to do at the end. I'll give credit to character design at least.

I played it on Normal Co-Op Mode and beat the game in less than 4 Hours on my first run.Wih that being said though, I still enjoyed playing the Game in Co-Op. The Story, albeit nothing outstanding, is interesting  (and cheesy) enough to keep you going, the Combat System, albeit a bit clunky, is entertaining enough as well. As you play through the game, you gain experience points and level up, gain more passive abilities, items etc etc. You can think of the Game as a very, very low budget version of ""Dungeon Siege 3""Long Story short, is it worth the Money?

Within an hour of playing, I could only describe everything about the game as abysmal. The game plays alot like God of War, except badly, and on a PC instead of a console. And it's not like God of War was a great game to begin with. You play as a human who was bonded to a vampire, and you can switch between the two. One character you have is a melee character, and one is ranged. The ranged character is insanely powerful, and the melee character dies in just a few hits. If you like autoaiming crossbows that only shoot where the game wants you to, then this game is for you. The game was really easy, but then you get to level two and find yourself chasing vampires and demons through a beachside scene. Well apparently, vampires in this universe are worse than the aliens in Signs. If you touch ANY water, you immediatly explode into a game over. What's even better is half the time you can't even tell the difference between water and regular ground, so you just end up running around and dying alot. If you also like a fixed camera angle that rotates around as you try to navigate difficult gaps you need to leap over (with water at the bottom) this games for you. I think the best part of the game was when during a cutscene, a NPC pathed through some fire in the beginning and died during the scene, but still kept talking to me.

Due to this fact, jumping from one spot to another was a crap shoot.  I found if you use the mouse pointer as your target destination it lessened the chances that you'll fall off a cliff, but I found I died more often being unable to judge jumping distances/platforms than I did from the enemies.- horrible aiming especially if you play as the female character.  I had a general rule that the mouse pointer was the crosshairs, but that wasn't 100% all the time, and the special crossbow shot would more often than not wind up missing its mark.- while not critical, the voice acting was deplorable, especially the banter between jeremy and alyssa (I can overlook this point though, as it doesn't impact the game too much).I found buying anything at the trader a waste of gold coins, if you grind it out long enough you'll find good weapons.I don't know if this is a good or bad point, but the game is relatively short."

The voice acting is done a little bad whenever extreme emotions are being played.That's how far I have to go to find a nitpick.Apart from that, the game is mediocre. Fun to play, but you will forget it as time goes by."

The game revolves around a pair of pre-disposed foes, a fallen holy knight and a vampire warrioress cursed to serve him, the pair must kill and consume his former allies in an attempt to prove that being turned into a vampire has not turned him into a blood-thirsty war monger who kills and eats people to further his own goals. You gain levels, buy new weapons and armor, and rise in power through a skill tree full of generic abilities.My greatest complaint is not about the level design, or the lackluster story, but rather how complete and utterly inept the voice actors are. I swear to zombie Jesus that these people are so wooden, any sex scenes they might contribute to would result in splinters in awkward places.Honestly, if you want a dungeon crawler RPG, buy Diabo, Gauntlet, or Van Helsing. While the intention may have been to provide players with a source of entertainment, this game falls depressingly short."

Boy am I glad I didn't pay full price for this.While the fast-paced combat is fun, everything else isn't: the visuals and animation are both dated, the music is decent at best, the story is laughable and barely makes any sense and the voice acting is just terrible. On top of that, the game is very short and there are no twists or alternate endings - moral choices you are given don’t affect the outcome of the story and just change a few lines of dialogue.Blood Knights is like a bad B-movie; it’s so bad and so ridiculous that you can’t help but love it in a way."

I enjoy the story but i wish there was more choices that made you seem more evil as a vampire and not just save the world in the end. The combat system is okay at the least if you not use in using wasd to move then i feel for you. Cause I was bad at first since i kept using bombs when i didn't want to. But over all I say this game is a 7/10.

Whether it's platforming, or combat, it simplistically excels. This game reminds me a lot of ""Hunted: Demon Forge"", so if you liked that, you'll like this.

It has a very cool combat and level up system, albeit standard to most rpgs, with the two characters' levelling being easy to switch between. However, when switching between characters in the level up screen, the ui flips, which can be less than fluid."

When considering buying this game, I was looking for something casual to play that was storyline heavy and had lots of cutscenes. I didn't want all the hassle and tasks that concerns games like the elder scrolls, dragon age and whatnot, you know where you gotta constantly recycle your inventory and carefully choose your skills and build and all the rest of it. This was perfect for that. The only significant downside was that it was too short. But still very good, clocked it in 6 or 7 hours I think. It doesn't have a new game plus, which is unfortunate. The story and the dialogue were very good it should be noted. I don't want to spoil it but there was a convorsation with a succubus and a summuned demon that was particularly amusing"

This is what it felt like playing Blood Knights. I enjoyed maximizing the gold boosts and experience boosts so that I could get those end tier weapons really quick from the shop trader. I think that alone was what kept me playing the game to the very end.Some parts of the game are frustrating such as the platforming sequences due to undefined areas or camera shifting which lead to instant death. I’m forced to backtrack to checkpoints so that I don’t have to fight enemies over and over when I die due to bad jumps.I like how my look changes when I change equipment. The graphics aren’t too amazing but they aren’t ugly either. Although I had fun playing on hard more the entire time, I wouldn’t play again even if there was a new game plus feature as there were a lot of aspects that were rough about the game such as the synching of cut scenes, odd voice acting, the hero becoming a sarcastic jester of sorts, enemy bosses that had potential to be great but were doomed to be uninspiring.Blood Knights is a good bang for your buck as it a semi-solid action RPG that you can bite and suck on for a good few hours, granted that you are willing to ignore some of it’s flaws. It will suck a good chunk of your time and you won’t regret it as long as you buy this game during a sale."

Overall, it was a fun hack'n'slash... but short one. I recommend it though, as it was nice.Pros:-good graphics and sound-some plot twists-moral choices-no bugs or crashes that I could find-character upgrades (both gear and abilities).-platformer (lots of jumping around, and it's nice when the camera works with you, not against you).Cons:-too short (normally you'd need 2 plays to get all content if you want to check both sides, but overall my almost 6 hours were one full play)-the damned camera - the game is clearly aimed at consoles so the camera moves as you move, and it's annoying and creates problems in several parts of the game as your characters move further according to the camera. So, for example, you might click the left arrow to jump but as the camera shifts you also need to click the up arrow as your trajectory on the next jump, despite being the same, would now land you over the edge. Horrible camera, most annoying part.-minor inconvenience: the SHIFT key is not an UP arrow for ages. This confused me and can turn away other players when they want to suck blood. You use SHIFT, not UP arrow.Overall, as I said, it was a fun hack'n'slash with a terrible camera and a bit short. Still interesting while it lasted."
