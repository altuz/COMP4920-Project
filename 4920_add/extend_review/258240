76561198006625700,Not Recommended,258240,9913832,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,H Kane,"Lots of potential, but it was rushed out the door pre-beta to get it on the virtual shelves by Christmas. So we got to beta test it, only to find the devs stopped fixing bugs around February. Some are real show stoppers, some are just annoying; visit the forums if you want to see a few pages' worth. I should point out there is absolutely no realism here; it's a toy, nothing more. Modding might be able to breathe some life into it, but at this point it's obvious they've washed their hands of it."

,Recommended,258240,7762976,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,Derpson,"The game is pretty good, but has some issues. Looks like it was rushed into release with all that it brings. Technical issues (seems like the game suffers from a memory leaks, as it started to lag/freeze and act unresponsive after an hour or so into playthrough) and poor AI being the most critical. Some gameplay mechanics and GUI are also not thought through well enough. On the bright side - game looks really well, nice GUI and unit textures, maps look great, game is really appealing visually. It also has some interesting gameplay mechanics, like carriers, naval warfare, supplies.The game is certainly good, but it could use some additional 3-4 months of polishing and debugging."
,Recommended,258240,7965244,"Posted: 7 December, 2013",all,Tyrant of Troy,"This is deep strategy with an eye for detail. In a lot of ways it's like a turn-based RUSE, but with much more realism and time to think. I have read a lot of negative reviews that say the game is too hard. Oh, poor babies! You think invading Axis Europe was easy? Hell no! So you can't take out the shore batteriess with ships or artillery? Maybe that's exactly what they were desiogned to resist! Oh no! What ever will we do? How about you use your dive bombers? Now there's an idea! This is exactly what makes the game great! You absolutely HAVE to rule the skies before even attempting a land-based advance. My only real criticisms are:  management of your aircraft squadrons is a bit messy, and generally a warning needs to be displayed if aircraft are low on fuel. Also, There needs to be a warning that tells you if you have forgotton to move and fire with any unit when you press 'next turn'.There has been a lot of talk about the following exploit: You can send in one unit followed by a group of ten, attack the enem,y with the lone unit and lose it to their counter attack. Then you can defeat the enemy unit with your ten and recieve no counter-attack. This is not a massive problem, but it xcould be fixed by allowing units infinite counter-attacks (ammo permitting), with exponentially decreasing effectiveness.Peoiple that are having trouble with operation Torch should think themselves lucky they are not trying to invade mainland Italy. Wow. Once you crack it, though, it's very reqarding. This game is a 'just one more turn' epic that will devour weeks of your life. Well worth every cent!"
,Not Recommended,258240,7836951,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,DrQuantum,"The concept is excellent. reminds me of panzer general. But the implementation is horrible. The game play is not smooth. The map, tooltips and unit info are more irritating than useful. The map scrolling leaves much to be desired. When I end my trun the game some times refuses to let me issue any orders to my units. The mission objectives and tutorials are not clear (possibably a bad translation). Several images are still in german. The number of unit types available and the unit balance is very poor. Come on people made a better version of this game in 1994! seriously do not waste your money, download panzer general (its abandonware) and run it off dosbox. You will find all that this game has to offer there and more."

But is not yet finished!!! Gets slow and/or freezes all the time. I can't get through the 4th mission, because it freezes every time when about only 2 rounds for me to win. So i'm really looking forward to some patches and updates, but till then it's not worth to pay for it. Unless you want to annoy yourself beyond all limits.. And additionally, big black dot for the lack of multiplayer possibilities! I don't even understand, what they thought to publish this game in this state. Finish it!!!"

I have spent hours trying to get past Operation Torch but all I end up doing is losing the battle ships and crusiers.  You cannot move the naval units so they are sitting ducks for powerful artillary bunkers that are nearly impossible to destroy.  In the first scenario if you land an artillary unit or fuel or ammo truck the Axis bunkers with extreme range immedialtey kill it.  The infanty are very weak and die quickly.  And to top that off the game runs so slow.  I don't have trouble with speed of any other steam game I own but this one moves like molasses.SAve your money and buy something else.  I may come back to it if they ever tone it down so you actually have a shot of winning.

Very Panzer General like but stands out with it's own gameplay elements.   Movement and Resupply are elements I felt detracted from gameplay, but others may like the extra planning considerations when it comes to protecting and keeping ammo and fuel nearby.  Killer was the resloution.  I couldn't read dialogue boxes without 1.5x magnifier.  Nearsighted folks will have no problem though.I liked it, and add a little for the nostalgic feel, but didn't love it.  A touch clunky for me in the end."

Also apparently tanks can shoot over mountains, who knew. Sad because the animation, landscape and A.I is quite good, and the game is even entertaining to a degree. Sorry, there are just far too many superiorturn based ""WW2"" strategy games on the market right now. If you've already played Panzer Corps, Order of Battle Pacific, Panzer General and others than perhaps pick this one up for a cute playthrough.6/10I recommend buying the game on sale.

In my opinion, this is not accurate.  If one reads the history of this operation, there was some resistance put up by the Vichy forces but nothing like what I have seen in the scenario.  Also, why can't the ships be moved?  They are too vulnerable to the shore batteries and should be able to be moved farther away for protection.   Another thing that has me concerned is that the description of the Mark III tank is ""heavy"" which is not true.  The Grant tank had a larger gun than the MK III in 1942, especially in this theater of war.Overall, the gameplay seems interesting and I'll continue to play.  Afterall, it was less than $10."

You have to save at the end of every turn because it crashes a LOT when ending your turn! Half way through the 3rd level when you reload the game after saving and ending the turn It crashes. The game loads fine again. You can  make moves but as soon as you end your turn it crashes every time. It's a fun game when it desides to work but these are game killing bugs. I can't recomend it.i5 gtx980 32Gb
