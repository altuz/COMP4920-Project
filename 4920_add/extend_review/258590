Every area is exactly te same, with no variety other than ice instaead f grass or lava instead of ice.2. Enemies are boring, only about 10 different enemies throughout the game.3. Like most beat-em-up games spamming the attack button as fast as you can is an easier way to win then actually trying.4. Acheivments are lame and uninspired.5. Graphics look like a slghty higher res N64 game.6. THIS IS A FREE GAME ONCARTOONNETWORK.COM. THEY CHARGE $10 ON STEAM.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."

Combat is fun, switching characters is too. I love all the little nods crammed in here towards the show as well. Also, it's the cheapest AT game at $8. If you're a fan, you can't go wrong."
,Not Recommended,258590,29937816,Posted: 15 February,all,🌸HelloKittyKawaii🌸,"I have to say, as a huge Adventure Time fan, I was completely and utterly disappointed by this game, I feel like it's very basic and the game play is more annoying as opposed to actually playing a fun, cute and humorous arcade type of platform game, it's almost like they didn't do any effort with this game and were only keen to make money since they knew so many people would be interested in an Adventure Time game on Steam.Expect a repetitive, boring and dull game. You will be bored to death within the first 15 minutes and it might even make you hesitant to watch Adventure Time for a while just because of how poorly this game was at capturing the Adventure Time franchise.I really wish they would would have added more characters like Lumpy Space Princess and some random penguins just for the heck of it, I mean, what is Adventure Time without Lumpy Space Princess? It feels empty, cheap and boring. Prepare to feel uninspired and annoyed for paying so much for a game that is also free, if you're gonna make people pay for a free game, at least have the decency to add some cute and fun features and give the game a bigger variety of maps and everything else for that matter.If I were you, rather save your money for something that will actually be enjoyable because I am completely saddened at this game that should have been a PlayStation 2 game, instead."

The retro-style music is incredible, and having the original VAs was an outstanding idea as it definitely feels like Adventure Time. Make sure when you're attacking to slowly press the key in time with the attacks, rather than mashing; it gives you a brief moment to realign your attack if the enemy's hitbox is out of your range."

Where you do the same thing over again.•	The audio sometimes overlaps itself•	Few lines of dialog in the game, they repeat quite often,o	Some characters don’t even have lines and instead are replaced with random sounds, similar to the character in Don’t Starve.The power are fun and unique but they don’t make up for the overall unpolished nature of this game.I got Jake stuck several time while playing, there is a feature where he can teleport out of walls to the player but if you don’t have certain spells I could see people actually getting stuck in the walls and not be able to proceed forward in the game.I wish that for once we could get an adventure time game that isn’t a cash in on the TV show."

,Recommended,258590,10038785,"Posted: 6 May, 2014",all,Captain MooMoos,"This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend this game skip toResultsand read from there.NGD Studios does a great job bringing Adventure Time to the video game world with this epic hack ‘n slash adventure. Adventure Time: Finn and Jake’s Epic Quest is a fantastic game that mixes the great elements from RPGs with the awesome level schemes of ToeJam & Earl.Story:Adventure Time: Finn and Jake’s Epic Quest takes you out of the Land of Ooo and throws you into a new world that splits Ooo into floating islands. You play as Finn and Jake as they find themselves in a video game, which they use to explain all the weird elements. BMO has gone missing and it’s up to you to bring him back, but where is he? As you progress through the game you receive clues that help you find your lost comrade. In order to solve the mystery you must find artifacts scattered throughout the worlds, and eventually you will find the key.Campaign:The campaign is split across four worlds, which you can either run through quickly or if you take your time exploring every corner. Each world has six levels and a boss, which you must use different tactics to defeat. The first world is the Witch’s Garden (if you remember the show this is where Jake loses his powers for an episode because he stole a donut), Ice Kingdom, Fire Kingdom, and Land of the Dead. The levels have various minions which are all from the show, and you will fight bosses that are all characters who Finn and Jake got into scruffs with.Gameplay:The game takes elements from hack ‘n slash titles and mixes it with that of ToeJam & Earl. In fact this game is almost exactly like Toe Jam and Earl except you can attack enemies. You find pages of the Enchiridion which you can use producing some sort of result either positive or negative. You can pay Princess Bubblegum to identify the pages, which if you ever find again it will remain identified (unless you use a page randomizer). Your character has a maximum level of 15, and every three levels you gain a new weapon. The weapons make your character stronger and grant them with special abilities. Jake is the powerhouse and Finn is for speed. As you progress throughout the game you will find keys which you can use to unlock chests, and you must search for artifacts. Similar to ToeJam & Earl you will be informed which levels artifacts are on so you don’t need to search every level. You can fall of the edges of the world which allows you to return to previous levels meaning you can go backwards in the campaign. Although unlike ToeJam & Earl you can only fall one level at a time, and the campaign seems to save the previous levels enemies so if you go back the levels are empty. The Enchiridion offers about thirty pages: two have negative results, three help you get across gorges, two of them give money, one of them gives health items, and the rest provide you with some sort of buff. Overall there are not too many pages, but you will enjoy them if you use them.Hints:> I found myself searching every nook and cranny of each level, but once you hit level 15 there is no point in hanging around.>Levels with artifacts tell you that they have artifacts, so you don’t need to search every level.>Don’t use any pages until you’ve had princess bubblegum examine them (because if you select the page randomizer you can lose really good pages).>I beat the game on hard and I played the entire game only using the occasional food page. If I were playing this game again I would use as many pages as possible because the game is incredibly easy either way.>The keys pass through the levels, so if you have some keys on one level you can bring them to the next one.>If you need to get off in a hurry just jump off the edge of the world, it saves the game for you and puts you at the end of the previous level.Results:Adventure Time: Finn and Jake’s Epic Quest is a brilliant game that brings together elements of traditional Hack ‘n Slash and combines it with the greatness of ToeJam & Earl. I would not be amazed if the developers made this as a tribute to ToeJam & Earl. The game has four different bosses, loads of different enemies, crazy amounts of Enchiridion pages that give you special abilities, 24 levels (28 if you include boss fights), and quests that keep you going. If you like adventure games, RPGs, and Hack ‘n Slash this is the game for you.Pros:+Long campaign with 28 total levels, including boss fights.+Loads of Enchiridion pages which allow you to essentially cast special spells.+Fifteen levels, which allow you to become stronger.+A funny story that brings Adventure Time to life.+Great voice acting and awesome music.+Four crazy boss fights that require you to use various tactics and strategies.+Two different characters which you can switch through using different abilities.+Decent graphicsCons:-The game can get rather repetitive; you definitely will want to take a break from it every now and then.-When you fall off a level it puts you right at the end of the previous level.-The audio volume settings are in the same page as the graphics settings (if you change the audio volume it also reapplies the graphic settings).-There could be more Enchiridion pages, the book seems kind of bland at times and most of the pages seem to accomplish the same thing.-There isn’t that much voice acting involved, there is very little conversation between any of the characters.-Even on hard this game is ridiculously easy."

My son thinks it's just a cool show while I, being and old man in my mid 30's, gets the D and D references and many other adult themes.  My opinion of the game is slighty biased.

HONESTY TIME!7/10Recommended for fans of ATThis game, is as others may have already said, is Toejam and Earl but with an AT skin. For those of you not familiar with Toejam and Earl, it's this game but with aliens and colorful presents instead of Finn, Jake and Enchiridion pages.Gameplay itself is a blast and beating up all the AT villains is just fun and partly crazy, freaking enchiridion pages out the ying yang lets you use whatever you want whenever. You think you've had all the fun then PARTY GOD shows up and you go maraud some more.As stated above this is honesty time. While the game is a lot of fun, its only a lot of fun till the end of third world, where everything caps out pretty much. By then you'll have long since found all the enchiridion pages and have probably maxed out the level and gotten all the weapons. This leaves it feeling a bit wanting, as the next seven levels in world five may simply be glazed over as the only reason for fighting enemies is to level up or get coins. Not needing anything else really you're free to scamper by every enemy as they really dont chase you.In short, had this game ended with beating up Fire King, it would be well rounded and just plain tons of fun, which it still is.I enjoyed it myself and I hope more come out like it, just a little more fine tuned."

Very reminiscent of games like ToeJam and Earl. Gameplay can be rather repetitive. Lack of open world saves or savepoints is a bit of a let down (saves at world entry portals i.e. checkpoints).It's more of a novelty purchase than anything.Visually mathematical and audibily algebraic, whether you're five or thirty-five, by the power of Glob, you'll be slamacow'ing across the Land of Ooo for hours on end.Original voice cast (Jake, Finn, BMO) provide their talents in game and commentary/instruction.

The game is set like diablo's dungeon crawl system, but your focus is to make it to the end of the stage (wherever that may be) with all of the relics on the stage. There is no minimap, so it gets a bit confusing at times. At the end of each world, there is a boss which relates to the show, and the area that you just completed which usually isn't that hard to fight.If you watch the show as much as I do, you'll appreciate the powerups, as they all relate to funny/cool things from the episodes."
,Not Recommended,258590,9797539,"Posted: 12 April, 2014",all,The Ancient Wizard,"At the moment I do not recommend the game. There are several game-breaking bugs;such as killing the forest witch when she sits on Finn or Jake - your camera zooms in all the way and all weapons except scrolls are useless.After the update I lost all my save data; I was already at the Ice King.Another problem is the weird control scheme. It uses the arrow keys instead of WASD and it kinda catches you off-guard.I also felt that there was a lot of hit and miss moments in this game, from the cutscenes being either poorly rigged mouth movements to just being a zoom in on the low resolution screenshot from the actual cartoon series.I do appeal to the original voice cast, and many references to previous episodes. However a pet peeve of mine is the world isn't open. Easily you could have just mashed all levels onto one big slate, as the grounds already look like puzzle pieces or maybe used a wall or forest like boundary instead of have the entire land of Ooo floating on the sky abyss."

There's plenty of references to the show, at least, and they are integrated with moderate success through the decision to make them affect gameplay rather than just be a collectibale on the side.The mechanics are, for the most part, bad. A fairly simple combat system with lots of walking in-between. Would have benefitted greatly from a more comprehensive map possibly accessible from the pause menu. All the collecting is meaningless; money and silver keys only get you enchiridion pages which are already in abundance and the combat is, again, so simple that the pages aren't really all that useful.There's been a lot of fuss over how much support the devs have shown after release. Well, cool your boots; its been like four days since release and, frankly, the game is so riddled with bugs it shouldn't have been released so prematurely. This is all the more embarrassing when you consider its a re-release of an, otherwise, free game.All in all, the reasonable pricetag makes up for a lot of its shortcomings, and, for the fans, being able to interact with the Adventure Time universe outside of the show is great.

Sure there'll be some new worlds a few levels ahead but I couldn't bother. Reviews called it a kid's Diablo but even compared to D3 it is really shallow with a good lot of backtracking and lacking a sense of progression, plot or going anywhere. Even though ARPGs are seldom plot-heavy the slow gameplay and lack of variation killed it fast for me.While not being broken or glaringly bad there's just nothing remarkable about it if you're a seasoned player who played the top 75% games of the last two decades.Even if you are a die-hard fan or just play an hour per week I believe there are dozens of better games you could waste your time on.

Being a HUGE toejam & earl fan from age 7, this game was a must buy for me and I'm not in the least bit disapointed. Gameplay is faster paced than toejam & earl and instead of mainly avoiding enemies like in tj&e, your fighting them. A very lite level up/upgrade system is also included. This game is a instant purchase for fans of tj&e. This game gives you a hint of what tj&e 3 should have been or what tj&e 4 needs to be if we ever get that. The only complaint is lack of MP, which will hopefully be added down the road, but if not I'll still be having a blast with F&J's Epic Quest."
,Not Recommended,258590,9821983,"Posted: 14 April, 2014",all,sexykins,"This game is so close to being really good, but a couple of really irritating (and easily fixable) problems stop me from recommending it.Firstly, there's too much repetition, especially with the levels being as big as they are. Moving through a level facing the same enemies over and over wouldn't be too bad if the levels were smaller, but they can be huge and chock full of bad guys, which makes taking them out really tiresome. Plus, with the levels being as big as they are it's easy to get lost, and the minimap just doesn't cut it without a zoom feature.Another issue is the poorly implemented Enchiridion system. There's not much point limiting the amount of page slots you get if most of the pages are pretty much useless anyway. Only a few of them are actually worth using more than once. This combined with the fact that activating a page often removes your ability to attack, forcing you to run around in circles aimlessly until it wears off, make it an upgrade system that doesn't feel like an upgrade.Having to go through the previous level again after falling off ledges is ridiculously frustrating. There's no point to it except punishing the player for being careless, which could easily have been accomplished by simply starting the current level again. As it is, it just feels like overkill.Overall the game isn't bad, but its lack of anything bar killing enemies and collecting pages makes it feel kind of sparse. Maybe if the devs add some extra features/content this would be more satsifying. Having said that, it's definitely not awasteof 10 dollars, and the only reason I'm giving a not recommended is the fact there's no neutral option."

At first you think it's going to be fun playing an exploration game in the vein of Adventure Time, but it's anything but fun. The ""look for stuff and backtrack"" design of gameplay is just tiresome by the 2nd world map, and by the 3rd, you just want it to be over and done with. The first Toe Jam & Earl game for the Sega Genesis had a similar feel and look, but was loads more fun.Not very challenging since you can easily avoid most enemies. Also disappointing that you can only level up to level 15, and as a result, you don't feel very powerful when defeating enemies.The last boss is awkward to fight since I beat him by chipping his healthy away very slowly and healing constantly - NOT good game design.Oh well, I know better.

It also seems Jake can be hit when not being used which is just a detriment to the party and reminds me of Minnie from the Mickey and Minnie game where if she dies you die.Also I recommand right now avoiding the Tree Witch as her greatest power is locking the whole game up.  She has an attack in which she sits on you (makes sense she does it to Jake in the show) and you have to quick time out.  Except sometimes she does the attack and the game just locks.  Oh you can see the mobs moving around and you can even quit to title but for whatever reason the quick time event doesn't load and you are just screwed.  This has happened to me now 4 times forcing me to lose all progress and restart the entire level.As for the game it's Toe Jam and Earl.  You are two aliens; searching for space parts. On levels that have holes that you can fall down to get to the previous level.  Gathering presents that you do not know what they do until you use them.  Looking for elevators to get you to the next level.  Replace aliens with Finn and Jake.  Replace space parts with game artifacts.  Replace presents with spells.  Replace elevators with portals.  Now you have Fine and Jake's Epic Quest.You would think this would bother me but frankly Toe Jam and Earl was a great game and if you aren't going to come up with your own good game at least rip one off.As I said at the start if you can ignore the bugs and have been looking for a Toe Jam and Earl game skinned as Finn and Jake then I recommend this game.

,Recommended,258590,9798078,"Posted: 12 April, 2014",all,Yesiamaduck,"Let first open this review off with this. Whilst I do ultimately recommend this game I feel it has plenty of issues which I'll go into.This game was so close to being this generations 'Toejam & Earl' so very close. For those of you that don't know Toejam & Earl is a game that came out on the sega genesis/megadrive way way back in 1990... or around about then. Regardless it went on to become one of my favourite games of all time and was a favorite between me and my friends when we fancied some co-op action.So when I found out this game was clearly inspired by Toejam & Earl I was over the moon and very excited. So much so that it coloured my early judgement of the game quite heavily and made me have more positive thoughts at the time than I perhaps should've.So Finn & Jake's Epic Quest is game where Finn and Jake go around a world (broken up into 6 levles + a boss battle) looking for the portal to the next one. In order to progress though some maps have artifacts (ship pieces for those familiar with Toejam & Earl) which must also be found along with the portal in order to progress. Other similarities to ToeJam & Earl include power ups which are a complete mystery until used which can (more often than not) give a benefit or (unfourtenetly rarely) a disadvantage... this includes the elusive Radomizer which made Toejam & Earl such an unforgiving game.Which is my first problem with this game... it's not nearly difficult enough. In Toejam & Earl the predictable nature of the enermies was completely forgivable because every last one of them was a genuine threat but in this game the enermies become moslty a means to grind out levels. All of them are completely avoidable and aren't particuarly fun to fight in large number and whilst the combat isn't bad, it feels okay and in groups can be mildly challenging, it becomes pretty tedious with only one apparent combo being present in the game 3 hours and 4 worlds in. Therefore the enermies become a meaningless obstacle which are just there for coin. Which is another issue... you never 'need' money... another thing about Toejam & Earl is money was scarce and it'd cost way more than you'd ever aquire to get everything you'd want on a single map. Here the enermies are easy enough to vanquish without the aid of powerups with the powerups only speeding up the time it takes to kill things and are only every needed when you need to fly or float to specific areas.... the powerups are fun though and the is a lot of variety on offer. But asides from the Randomizer and 'Knife Storm' I saw no powerups which reminded me of 'Total Bummer' or 'Rocket Skates' on Toejam & Earl... in other words just go nuts and dont worry about any ill effects you'll be able to get them all identified again anyways because it's so cheap to do so.Also the is no co-op, this is a galreing omission from a game thats inspired by a game that is known for it's innovative co-op mode where players where able to individually explore other areas of map but other stages entirely... the tag system from toejam & earl is here but no co-op.But on it's own merits it's still a decent game for the price, it looks good enough, the gameplay provides a nice distraction in small bursts and you get quite a lot for your money. (I reckon 5hours if you try to complete everything and level up your character) and it's a solid homage to one of my favorite games of all time. It's not bad for a licenced game and is worth the asking price but those looking for a true spiritual succesor to Toejam & Earl this isn't it. It's so close to being a very nice modernized version of it but it falls short of truely capturing what the game great and instead is just a fairly enjoyable romp for a small fee."

The only voice acting is by Finn, Jake, and BMO however it doesn't lose any of the charm of the show. It's definitely an ode to classics like Toejam & Earl, I got about 6 hours of playtime out of it and that's from exploring every level and killing everything up until I hit max experience at Level 15. From there it was a speed run through the 2nd to last and final world. I highly recommend it as a great way to kill an afternoon with characters you love. Unfortunately, the only replayability is to replay at a more difficult level."
,Recommended,258590,11548254,"Posted: 4 August, 2014",all,zEr0,This game is pretty awesome. I got it a while back but didn't get to play much because my games were deleted off my computer shortly after but that's besides the point. The game is just what it looks like... super fun. The graphics are nice and the music is pretty fun but the sounds in the game are repetitive which is something that really bugs me and is a common thing I noticed people saying in other reviews before I bought this. But besides that minor flaw the game can provide fun until the end of the game and possibly another playthrough

Toe Jam and Earl for sega was terribly difficult and boring (no saving) after 2+ hours playing.I just noticed I had this game and loaded it up just for the achievements (all of them worked) and I think I got it in a Humble Bundle or something. It's funny that it's free on CN, but overall I think if I had known it played like Toe Jam and Earl up front I'd have probably picked this up on sale (since I'm not going to hassle with CN's website or a mobile version).On the side, lvl 15 is the max for billy and keep some open spots in the spell book because there are more spells than there are slots. I later got a Free Level spell only because I finally used all my gold/treasure spells and made slots available and then I found new 'Random' Cards that needed inspected by Princess Bubblegum."
