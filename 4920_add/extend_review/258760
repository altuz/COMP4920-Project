76561198115387907,Recommended,258760,9282490,"Posted: 27 February, 2014",all,Tony Torque,"Amazing!For those who know and played Euro Truck Simulator 2: This is the same developer, so the ""basics"" in physics and gameplay are  similar (Controls and graphics seem to be much better as far as I can tell).The game itself is different. There is a freeride/delivery-mode as you might know it from ETS2, but it is smaller and, as far as I can see now, less complex (still much fun to play). The ´amazingness´ (Is that a word?) of this game comes from the many modes and missions. Drive along a messed-up road, a mountain pass, or a flooded area (...).  This game seems to be the ""middle"" between ETS2 and 3, to show off what is planned for #3 and what this engine can do.So, in short:+better graphics+better controls+runs much more smooth than ETS2+exciting (!) roads: building sites, narrow bits and tricky obstacles of all kind+brilliant missions+online top-lists encourage competition and motivate to play every mission a thousand times+very well playable with keyboard, pad or wheel+not an easy game at all, but not frustrating->If you screw up a mission, you will go out with 0 points unable to compete with anyone online, but you will never get stuck in a mission, forced to do it a million times in order to be able to go to the next one+++Devs seem to actually read forums and watch videos about their game and listen to the players-the AI has some minor glitches: nothing game-breaking, more funnyConclusion: If you liked ETS2, you will love this game even more. It has everything that people wanted in ETS2.If you have never played ETS and you like to drive trucks in every kind of situation, then this game is something for you.Recommended .... totally!Edit: Game seems to crash when doing Alt+Tab, at least for me. Solution: Window mode (which means fullscreen + task bar) or use OpenGL.Edit²: I found out that this game was released BEFORE ETS2 (Thank you, comments section!). Seems like the fancy graphics have tricked me into some wrong thoughts. ;)"

Only difference is as stated above. This: A technical truck driving simulator. ETS 2: An open truck driving simulator. This doesn't have any managerial aspects (running your own business) but ETS 2 does.One thing I will add though. I think this game would have been better served as a DLC of some kind."
76561198007923471,Recommended,258760,32191572,Posted: 4 June,all,MOMO & YUNA,"I have played Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) before i bought Scania Truck Driving Simulator (STS). So i got to compare both games. I bought STS on sale which was very cheap or almost free.The main differences from ETS2:1. STS has no money or economy system - you do not do any business or management. You just earn points or skills which cannot be used to upgrade or buy anything, you just unlock the next level.2. STS is purely a driving school or driving tests.3. The map is small (just one city, not the whole Europe like ETS2).Similar things to ETS2:1. The graphic and sound quality is very close, hard to tell the difference.2. Same truck model as in ETS2 (in STS you have only one truck to play that is Scania R)Things that STS is better than ETS2:1. The vanilla truck physics of STS is better than ETS2 vanilla. (the cabin movement and the suspension is more realistic)2. Sound of the truck.My verdict:In general, every ETS2 player should play STS before playing ETS2 because it's like going to a driving school to practice and get a license before you can drive a truck across Europe. STS will make you a good truck driver before you head out to ETS2.But if you are like me, having played ETS2 before, then you probably don't need STS. If you still buy it anyway, you probably will not play it anymore after a few hours, unless you want to go back to retrain yourself. It's not something you will play for hundreds or thousands of hours like ETS2.In STS you can also do cargo delivery mode, but you are stuck in one city only, and the companies are very close to each other. It will take only 5 - 10 minutes real life time to complete one delivery. You just drive within the city limits most of the time.It's a very good game but the scope is too small that it should have been part of ETS2 or expansion pack rather than a standalone game.Buy it if any of the following is your case:1. You have never played ETS2 before.2. It's very cheap for you. (maybe on sale)3. You have played ETS2 before but you wish to retrain or get a proper training."

It obviously is different than ETS2 (Euro Truck Simulator 2) which many of the reviewers have already mentioned. It has less to offer, only one truck brand and delivering cargo seems to take the minor part in the game. Yet I do recommend it for those people who like precision-driving. This game can really teach you how to properly steer a truck with (or without) a trailer when there is not much space available to manouever. I had lots of fun doing the really challenging  dangerous courses. The game includes some media, mostly photos of Scania trucks, truck-driver competitions and also some short video clips all about trucks and driving them. It maybe is not worth its full price of 15,99€, but if you can manage to grab it for 5€ or below it is totally worth it in my opinion. Recommended!"

And if you are going to pay full retail price for this game, buy ETS2 instead.Scania Truck Driving Simulator was made by the developers who made Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is a good thing. The game itself is really great and totally worth the price, but that's because it's almost the same game as ETS2, same map, same vehicles (but only the Scania ones) and same graphics. What I've seen, there's no story mode in this game, unlike ETS2 where you can start like a freelancer make your company growing until you have several employees and trucks. However, that's not how this game was supposed to be either, because then it would have been exactly like ETS2 -but worse.This game though, have some good game modes, including multiplayer and a wide range of tasks. For those who just like driving around, there is a free mode where you can just drive around and do anything you want.At last, as I always do, I recommend this game to the players with a WHEEL, as in my opinion, all driving games are boring with keyboard and mouse. BUT if you do enjoy this kind of games with any kind of controller - don't care about what I think and buy the game."
,Recommended,258760,25267503,"Posted: 31 August, 2016",all,Whiteswart,"One major note forward - this game is even less playable by generic ""boredom banisher"" than Euro Truck Sim. Stab and steer, while trying not to catch anything with your long and awkward container... Not the closest description of the fun I can reckon.With that said, the game is alright - in terms of visuals, controls, and, more of all - physics and challenges. If you were ever wandering how's that feels like to drive something as big as that - it's just second best after trying the real wheel. And much more safe all along.What is really good after you'll manage the basics - is about variety of conditions to overcome. And even if you're doing good - there's always a chart with top-scores of points and best time to beat, and it is there the line when you're understanding how casual you are... Neverending challenge to be an average, almost the same as in CS:GO and similar shooters... Only miles harder.So - my mark is 6.5/10, but if I were the trucker, I'd vouch for 8.5/10, I guess."

We bought is while on Steam sale for a mere £2.69 just to see what it was like and we were not disappointed. Unlike ETS2, the emphasis is on skillful driving rather than load delivery. So far we have only completed the European Young Driver of the Year competition and the opening Driving Test challnges so I cannot comment on the remaining challenges.Graphics and gameplay is very similar to ETS2. We use a Logitech G29 which is supported by the game.If in doubt please feel free to check out our video series of the game for a better idea of what to expect:https://youtu.be/0F81NCUaC50"

It is made by SCS so you know it will definatly be a good game. This simulator puts your skills to the test! Get ready, your in for a fun-packed challenge!The game comes down to 5 different sections:Driver Licence-This is just the beginning of the challenges. You will be put through several tests such as reversing, parking, reverse serpentine, and parking.Driver Competition-This is were you put your skills to the test were your are chellenged with extremly hard challenges such as roundabouts, almost impossible reverses, and more. These driver competetions also take place in real life.Dangerous Drives-You are put through TONS of different situations such as you being stuck in traffic and the only way out is to go on a road with parked cars all over and try to make it through without crashing! Easier said then done!Freeform Driving-This is the part of the game that is similiar to Euro Truck Simulator 2 were you deliver goods to different places. However, the only downsides are that there is no navigation/minimap so when you are trying to make a delivery, there is no way of knowing were to go. You are basically always lost. The map is also not that big, but its a good size.Time Reaction Tests-Lastly, you have the time reaction tests were you are supposed to trive through roads and they give you a ""obsticle"" and you are supposed to stop as soon as possible.Overall, This is a GREAT game and I think that it was nessasary that SCS made this game because it really puts your skills to the test and it determens whether you are a great driver or not. It is also Great fun!Watch me play it!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aIViy7ESMU&feature=youtu.beFINAL RATING: 9/10The reason I gave it a 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because of the problems with the free driving.

While I really enjoy some of the details in Scania I ended up a bit frustrated with it.Pros:+ Definitely more realistic driving simulator than ETS2+ Challenging scenariosCons:- Bugs with steering wheel and pedal setup (Fanatec v2, v3 pedals and H-pattern): I had to copy the setup file from ETS2 and edit it manually to make it work at all- Force feedback has occasional bugs: Ends up working at all or suddenly turns off for a short moment- Engine sound is really low compared to everything else and you can't adjust it- Other cars in traffic sometimes drive through walls or otherwise act insanely- The game is a bunch of driving scenarios without a bigger pictureI recommend this if you really enjoy practicing your parking skills and practicing driving through tight spots."

Also great for people who are competitive as the game features online leaderboards if you have the money to spare i would definatly reccomend grabbing the Deluxe bundle edition as you will get 5 games and plenty of the DLC for ETS2 for only $50 which is alot cheaper than buying the 5 games individually and they are all just as good as each other even if some are older or you only end up playing ETS2 (which alot of people do) it is definatly worth the money (and the money saved) to get this game in the bundle."

Still a really good game though, if you love ETS2 like me, but you suck at it, not like me, then this game is perfect for you, as it has a huge training mode.It tests your ability to reverse with a trailer, go around tight bends, drive through heavy traffic and even up mountain sides where the road is thinner than your truck.I got this for £0.69 on the summer sale, so for that price!

There is no damage model or career mode but you can practice pulling and parking a trailer and traversing the narrow highways of a European town.There are a lot of difficult parking challenges which makes it worth buying for someone that already plays games like Euro Truck.Regardless, it is worth getting on sale and having a go with it at least once."

,Recommended,258760,11226492,"Posted: 13 July, 2014",all,Crache,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 was like a trucker business sim, with long stretches of road and jobs to take on and get paid so you can buy/upgrade trucks or start your own business.  Picking up trailers or delivering them was always really easy, so it wasn't challenging enough to be interesting and the long stretches of road were populated enough with details to be somewhat convincing, but it gets old after a while.  The real star of Euro Truck Simulator 2 was the fantastic traffic AI and dealing with traffic respectfully throughout your travels.  A great game for what it is.Scania Truck Driving Simulator is made by the same company, but this time it focuses on everything about truck driving that is technical.  There are truck driving license tests, there are championship truck driving competition challenges (exact copies of real life events) which require extreme precision and there are short refined stretches of dangerous drives to attempt more like natural obstacle tracks.I ate a lot of penalties for minor collisions, but some of the challenges were tricky just to finish at all due to very particular trailer angling requirements around certain bends.  You're forced to understand what each mirror is for and gain an appreciation for them, putting them to regular use.  Through-out the game, you come to understand some of the strategies necessary to accomodate for the semitrailer.While it has all those challenge modes, it also has a couple freeroam modes similar to a large city in ETS2 that have trailer missions to pick up and medals to collect if you can find them.  Certainly the most casual of the modes, it does not have ETS2's lengthy 30 minute drive requirements and instead focuses more on quick pickup and deliveries with technical driving aspects.If trucks don't interest you this probably won't change that, but if you care a little bit then you are likely to come out of it feeling elucidated in respect to trucking."

If you think backing a trailer is hard in ETS2, just wait until you experience the rage-fuelled exercise in misery that attempting the same in STDS turns out to be. Your gear-shifting has to be more accurate, your stopping distances longer, and if you're anything like me, you'll stall the truck roughly 285 times during hill-starts or when manoeuvring at low speed. (Planting your foot on the accelerator for a couple of seconds before releasing the clutch rapidly becomes a way of life.) And if you think you can just hook up a trailer and trundle off in 4th gear like you do in ETS2... I'm afraid not. The Scania you have in STDS is powered by an emaciated hamster with a respiratory infection, and he just can't turn that driveshaft fast enough.Compared to this, ETS2 is child's play. You spend the vast majority of your time cruising down the Autobahn listening to Def Leppard. In STDS, you're navigating tiny cargo yards strewn with pallets and forkhoists, or squeezing down narrow side streets between parked cars and roadworks. And then, if you actually manage to get to your destination without ploughing into a field or getting yourself stuck in a hedge, you'll spend the next 20 minutes performing a 27 point turn in a cack-handed attempt to slot the trailer into the crevice left between another trailer and those barrels some git left sitting in the middle of the yard.Most of the truck drivers I know swear a lot. If there was such a thing as the 'profanity olympics', they'd be gold medallists. Now that I've played STDS, I know why. Having said that, it's a lot of fun. You do, after a few hours spent shrieking like a lunatic and cursing the laws of physics, get the hang of it. I can now make deliveries without causing a multiple car pile up in the middle of an intersection. I can navigate the city (no GPS for you, young man) pretty well, and I can even reverse my trailer into position without stalling, punching a hole through a fence or reducing a pedestrian to an unsightly crimson smear on the pavement. I still can't parallel park. But then I can barely parallel park my car, so I'm not that fussed to be honest.To sum up, STDS is basically ETS2 with mushy controls, crappy force feedback, slightly dodgy physics, somewhat underwhelming audio (the Scania doesn't so much roar as mewl piteously), no career mode, a much smaller map, and a learning curve so steep you'll need a velcro wetsuit dipped in PVA glue to have even a hope of scaling it. Unlike ETS2, it forces you to drive properly -- pay attention to your mirrors, shift gears at the right time, make tiny adjustments to the steering wheel when manoeuvring, and practice, practice, practice. Because it really is a simulator (as well as being a gloriously shameless advertising campaign for Scania), as opposed to a scenic tour of Europe by truck. I love both games, and for completely different reasons, but I would recommend STDS to die-hard truck driving fans, Scania fetishists and masochists only. This is a game that will kick you in the crotch and then laugh about it, but if you're willing to spend the time (and we're talking a lot of time here) mastering it, it may eventually shake your hand and buy you a pint.Maybe."

And if you are going to pay full retail price for this game, buy ETS2 instead.Scania Truck Driving Simulator was made by the developers who made Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is a good thing. The game itself is really great and totally worth the price, but that's because it's almost the same game as ETS2, same map, same vehicles (but only the Scania ones) and same graphics. What I've seen, there's no story mode in this game, unlike ETS2 where you can start like a freelancer make your company growing until you have several employees and trucks. However, that's not how this game was supposed to be either, because then it would have been exactly like ETS2 -but worse.This game though, have some good game modes, including multiplayer and a wide range of tasks. For those who just like driving around, there is a free mode where you can just drive around and do anything you want.At last, as I always do, I recommend this game to the players with a WHEEL, as in my opinion, all driving games are boring with keyboard and mouse. BUT if you do enjoy this kind of games with any kind of controller - don't care about what I think and buy the game."

The only drawback is absence of actual instructions on how to maneuver your semi trailer properly. There are licence courses, but no lessons.

Doing everything using just mirrors and visual observation from driver's seat is not easy, but external cameras make tasks too simple.

I bought American Truck when it came out in February. This went on sale in June, so I picked it up, just for fun. Then, I went to school in August to get my CDL (in the USA). There's 3 parts to CDL training, the classroom, the range, and the road. The classroom is boring but necessary; it's the rules and regulations you NEED to know to get your CDL. The road, well that's self-explanatory. The range, that's the intermediate step, and, for many, it's where they fail their skills test.The range is where they test your knowledge of pre-trip inspection, it's also where they test your ability to manuever in tight spaces;parking.The straight back, the offset back sight side (left), the offset back blind side (right), the parallel park (sight side & blind side), and the Alley dock (90 degree sight side). I could do them all fairly well with very little practice; both my grandfather and my father were truck drivers, I'd better be able to. But about every 3rd time I did the alley dock, I'd miss and screw it up. So, I spent about four hours practicing each of the above in Scania Truck Driving Simulator one Sunday. The next morning I went to the range, and nailed the Alley dock four times in a row. Even with the added length of a long-nose Freightliner and a 53' trailer compared to whatever cute little setup the Europeans use, I had no trouble translating the practicing done with this simulator into real world skills.Even if you're not getting your CDL, buy this game, it will help you to appreciate the skill of the average truck driver."

76561198339351460,Not Recommended,258760,33180093,Posted: 3 July,all,HighOffLemons,"Some content is fun like the practice and mini games like knocking down the pole however content is rather lacking. Driving physics are rather similar to ETS2 however wheel support is awful in this game. No matter how much you change your wheel settings to have less or more force feedback nothing changes when driving. The force feedback is way to strong and the wheel centering snaps instantly and pulls your hand vigourously with it.Graphics are ok but nothing like ETS2's standars. Interiors are very low quality with the dashboard being blury and lighting effects are poorly done. Not much change is made with max graphics either.Not a bad game for the price but if you want more content and many more hours of fun I'd go for ETS2 or ATS since they have more content, amazing graphics, the community for both modding and multiplayer and the game is pretty much endless compared to Scania Truck Driving Simulator"

But overall it's pretty good as a break from racing games and so on. At least for me."
