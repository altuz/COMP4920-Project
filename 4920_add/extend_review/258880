To Sum up...Farming Simulator 2013 is the most feature rich, realistic farming Simulator currently released....and that my friends is a sad statement in its self....if you are looking for a simulator...'other than driving a tractor' then this is not for you.Have spent close to 20 Hrs trying to give it a 'chance';I consider this to be just a 3rd rate clone of an actual farm sim...you have to imagine everything...no ACTUAL substance...only the promise of what could be....limited machines, seasons are just for show, yields are the same pretty much no matter what you do...if you already own farm simulator you get nothing new here and less features..just a different view of barns and fields...gonna uninstall and then come back and check it out during the summer sale and see if they added any substance via DLC and able to get it at what it would actually be worth...usually 70-80% off...see you over in Farming Simulator land!"

What more could you want....maybe if the game would actually work!First of all this is the first time i have ever bought a farming simulator so I haven’t got much to compare it with.The first hour you play is jaw dropping. You got spawned into your lovely farm. complete with a chicken coop stone sheds and a house. I think the whole place looks great! really well designed and created. Then you turn a corner and then say ""oh my god! It’s a TRACTOR"" you hit the shift key to put your heavy booted farmer into a over excited sprint, get up alongside, hit the enter key and fire her up! You hook up a plough and then out the road to one of your fields for a fantastic day of ploughing!Unfortunately this excitement is very short lived......After about an hour of playing you start to realise that there is one or two things a miss. After the 5th hour most people will surmise that there has been a HUGE amount left out of the game. To name but a few;No Workers. Just mythical pixies that magically transform your fields from different states with only a mouse click...There is uproar about this...You can spend 4 hours preparing fields for harvest only to skip to the next round to find that all your fields have been completely wiped clean. ""No Christmas this year kids...we have been hit by some plague?""Loading a trailer with bales of hay is nearly impossible. The physics is just all wrongThe map is huge. I mean its whopper big! But it takes about 7 days to get anywhere!It is obvious that this game was rushed and incomplete. I think that it is appalling that this game wasn’t properly tested before launch. It’s a rip off.I could go on and on. But it’s all been said before.I urge you to check out the forums before you pay for this!!!"

It's not like you can buy them, but what would be the point anyways, they're just part of the landscape.  The livestock is nothing but a non-existant part of the game.  Cattle, chickens, rabbits?  Haven't seen one in the game.  Sure, I've driven to the their respective barns/buildings but that's all you do.Anyways, in the end this game is nothing but a big disappointment.  I wouldn't bother trying the DLC since it would only add more 'nothing' to the game.  Well, you'd get to drive around different equipment I guess but that's all this game turned out to be for me.A farming equipment driving simulator with LONG, LONG road trips, with very little actual farming happening.Feel free to go through my screenshots of the game which will offer you some visual assistance with what I've said.http://steamcommunity.com/id/warondar/screenshots/?appid=258880&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall"

Whatever you want to do (buy seeds, equipment, bank) you have to drive.  Driving from one place to the other takes a long time. I feel driving from one place to the other most of the time.Working a field requires plow, cultivate, seeding, fertilizing (optional). In FS2013 normally the fields are already plowed and from one harvest to other you just need to cultivate and seeding (can be done at the same time with proper equipment).I prefer the economic system of FS2013 with the prices tendencies, great demands and different places to sell the goods.I think there are more things to do in FS2013 and more ways to make money. Silage processing, wool selling, mixed rations for cows.In PF2014 with the seasons system I feel in turn based game. Probably seasons are more realistic but I prefer FS way.First farm sim I purchased was Agricultural Simulator. No comment.After that I was thinking between PF2014 and FS2013. I decided to buy PF2014 (full price). Finally I had to buy FS2013 which I prefer.I haven't spent too much time with PF2014 because after purchasing FS2013 I don't want to play PF2014 again. Probably after some further development the situation may change but so far, this is my personal opinion.Regards."

If you want auto everything DO NOT BUY.This game is about BEING a farmer. It's hard graft and can get quite tedious. You do have AI of sorts but it's click-done AI, not a pixel farmer you can follow around.My review gets a + only if you understand that it's about BEING a farmer. If that's what you like, get it. You'll enjoy it.Now to flesh this out.- The graphics are pretty good and on on i7/670gtx, it hums along maxed out at 60 (with vsync). Some of the detail is very well done, albeit with a very Euro flavour.- The tute is on rails and must be followed but once you learn the locations and the techniques it's better to go freeplay.- Tractor driving is very manual and takes some getting used to. NOTE: *Look* at the lower left for how to change the gearbox ratios.  (And reversing is REAL reversing, not just pressing a down key).- Some machines are missing cruise control at time of writing. Missing as in, devs probably assumed it wasn't needed. They were wrong and as far as I know, will change it.CROPS- Limited but enough to keep interest. (and in reality, not all farms can grow all crops anyway)- Seasonal variations (a big feature) in yield work fairly accurately and devs are working on making it better.- Seed prices. Enough to make BEING a farmer worthwhile.ANIMALS- As good as non existent. Worth having for the extra income (3k or so per qtr) but there is no management or husbandry. (and it's incorrect for many to believe all farms have animals anyway - a common complaint. Most ""real"" farms are fairly dedicated enterprises. Such diversity is usually reserved for smaller hobby farms,  certainly in Australia anyway)EQUIPMENT- A bit short in this department (again devs are on it) but there is certainly enough to crop and harvest every field with ease.- The equipment shop is badly designed and laid out (imho) but equipment purchases are close to a one-off in RL anyway.FIELDS- Some nice looking layering is used for the various states and the PDA provides field status etc. as you work.- Crop yields etc. are RT as you harvest (F2 PDA)MAP- Big. Generous number of paddocks. No real monsters but you'll be working really hard if you own even a quarter of them.- Shop to shop transactions. Poorly done. You gotta drive to the bank, the seed shop, the tractor shop manually - everytime. Will devs change this? Unknown but can be very, very tedious. (see gearbox ratios above - take stock of it).OVERALL- A good game for players who like the down and dirty of farming. I reiterate though, if you want an ""auto"" farm managment game, DO NOT BUY.- Scenery is nice, gameplay is consistent. Some glaring anomalies but very easy to forgive.- Sound is pretty ordinary and equipment sounds are pretty lame. No engine load being the biggest let down. It won't take long to despise the music but a few well placed Oggs can fix that.There are some issues, some by poor design, some by poor release. Devs seem to be willing to listen and ready to take on constructive critique.I'd say a price of $20 is reasonable but it's relative. If you're tight for cash but love to farm, wait for the specials.7/10"

Its just stupid that the maker of this game had released this game very to quick..The game wasnt finished when it was released.. Really a shame!!.The game have to much bugs in it, vehicles / equipment selling / buying goes on a very poor quality menu..It could be like more on Farming simulator 2011 / 2013.. I have all the three games so i can give my opinion on this game..FS 2013 looks in quality more better, but its getting to boring soon.. Dont like the system of buying seed in FS2013, cant upgrade the silos in FS2013, graphics in FS2013 looks to kiddy to me( i like to see more realism in graphics)So PF2014 have quality items in it: Buying seed, Buying manure, you have a shed to store bales in it. I like that the vehicles are washable, and that you need to buy a big stock of petrol on the gas station to refill the gastank on your farm... Those things make a farm sim more enjoyable.. FS2013 is just boring on the longer playtime, dont like the mods on FS2013.. They make the game less quality (because there is no standard that people need to guide to.) Then you getting bad quality mods in the game... So overall its an ok game if you look to the basics... But its needs more improvement and bug fixes..So i cant recommend it for now.. UIG isnt very help full on their forums.. Trying to get my account enabled.. PMed Heini two times, looks like they blind or so.. So they arent customer minded.."

I've played Farming Simulator 2013 and it gets old really fast lack of options and detail are bad. But this game went something like this:  enter tractor hold down gas pedel for 2 hr's (no cruise and max speed 24kh) go to machinery store check out limited machines, go to bank borrow 250,000E, go to another place of interest on map, ""nothing there"". head home, buy up all the fields on the way home some allready planted some not, by the time i'm back at home base i have about 25k euros left, that included buying 20 cows, 50 chickens and 50 ducks max limit on them all. (I have no control whatsoever with any livestock just pay for them and there milk, eggs, and ducks sell automaticlly every session) and buying a weather station, completly pointless and useless. and upgrading my silos wich is kinda cool but pointless cause everything you grow with a worker sells automaticly..... So now i'm standing in one place hiring workers who plow, cultivate, plant, and harvest♥♥♥♥♥♥instantly. (no hiring to fertilize has to be done manualy but it doesn't have to be done) and it takes me a little over 20 minutes to get my bank back up to 100k just standing in one place never looking at a field or getting in a tractor feeding the ckickens or cows or ducks or purchasing one peice of equipment.......I would rate this game out of 10 stars: minus 50 by far the bigest wast of gaming money I ever spent."

I use the term lightly; expecting the game to shine brightly after the very popular farming sims of past. Yet this was not the case and I took certain factors for granted when I bought it.One of them was the driving; anyone who releases a game that involves driving and then skips any support or settings for a steering wheel what so ever should be shot in my opinion.No settings at all in fact and if you try to set up your wheel useing the wheels profiler, you will end up with some very unplesent effects. The problems mounted when trying to steer at all and was left frustrated after 2 days of problem searches on the internet. You seem to have fewer controls than The last games too, so less to think about and do!So I have not been able to play it yet, I was told to try using an xbox controller and when you start the game your given an option to choose the controller and so via ""The BIG PICTURE"", you enter the game to find the controls reverting to the keyboard and with no support for any manual settings at all, what a total waiste of money.On starting the game the first buttons you should see were missing for me, so a re-start already! The landscape has been made to look bright and cheery when you start, nothing wrong with that if you like over saturated autom colors. I could see alote of gaps in the geometry and the road patterns did not line up properly. Even the tractor models were of a very low quality with graphics set to the highest. I thought the realisum in this game was lacking, so living into the role might prove  difficult for some.To summerize.An attempt to make a fast buck here and nothing more, a cheap looking alfa, that has been packaged to look like a finished game that you can´t play. If you want to use a keyboard for a sim thats about 95% driving, then you are better off playing Pacman.I managed to let off some steam here at least (no punn intended) and can not recomend this in it´s current state."

There are a lot of missing configuration items like inverting mouse and whatnot. Otherwise it works OK. Do NOT skip a waypoint for a mission. It does not autoupdate to the destination if you take a shortcut. PF2014 is extremely sensitive to Steam updates. If your game is running very slow (~5 fps), drop out and make sure Steam isn't whining for an update.There are a few let's plays to show you equipment options (rather thin), seed options (about six or seven) and animal options (only 3). No workers, etc. So far it's basically an Agricultural Simulator without the terrible bugs and such. I do NOT like the way a field updates to the next stage at 95% (like Agrar Sim) and you aren't penalized for missing spots, etc. like in FS series. As long as you get to 95% completion of each stage of farming (plow, cultivate, seed, fertilize) it gives you the fixed total yield for the whole field."

""Planning by season""? i am not a farmer in real life, i actually know almost nothing about it, so i was kind of depending on the ""expert knowledge"" that isnt in the game.

""Crop rotation""? guess i will have to google that too, because your on your own after the first year where your only growing wheat.

My number one reason for down voting this is it says it has xbox controller support even has an option for it in the start window.  And it simply does not work with an xbox remote.

,Not Recommended,258880,9941392,"Posted: 26 April, 2014",all,bootlegger,"I had decent Hopes for this game but it fails for me on many levels. It does do some new things such as having seasons but they don't seem to have any effect that I have been able to observe. The interface is limited and making purchases of any type  requires driving all over the map to each individual store. The machine and implement selection is very limited with ne apparent partnership support. Hiring workers is like sprinkling magic pixie dust to achieve goals as you can literally stand by a field and watch it instantly change ploughed, cultivated and seeded status mere seconds after ""hiring"" a worker to perform a task. Other games in the genre do this far better as they require you to own the necessary equipment and it takes the workers the same amount of time as it would for you to do the task. Hiring workers should be about performing multiple tasks at once not wishing them done. No multiplayer support and no apparent mod support. Not a pleasurable experience. If you want to play a better game then get Farming Simulator 2013.Addendum: Or get Farming Simulator 15. Giants seems to have a lock on making playable and enjoyable farm simulators."

There has not been an update for it in 2 months short of a year. The game lags like nothing I've ever seen before and there have been multiple accounts of people complaining about not being able to enter or exit any vehicles. Wasn't it brilliant of the developer to release this game without a key rebind for entering and exiting vehicles? I bought this game a month before it released, in anticipation that it would be something great. I was sadly disappointed. $25 down the drain for a game that doesn't even work."
