One added all the features of the regular game and two let you play a FRICKING LAN GAME then this would be  a mod everyone plays. Just add the AI such as civilians and military and everyone is happy.... I think.

The several servers each with their own unique take at the game give it the much needed variety. RLS server has by far been my favourite of all as it provides oppurtunities for aspects other than killing and blowing stuff up."

76561198215001096,Recommended,259080,30130981,Posted: 23 February,all,Rafer Mt.Fiji,"This is meh. The community is very active and the servers are always full, but the game is plagued with bugs, server response errors and connection problems. Maybe one day these will be solved, and when that happens this will be among the best mods on Steam, but until then it lacks to much to be well-ranked.6/10"
