Wasteland surprisingly has a good atmosphere and sometimes I can actually imagine the rangers fighting off hoardes of robots or leather jerks; I can really immerse myself in this game despite how ""dated"" it may be. You have a wide variety of skills and attributes to use at your disposal for any situation you may find yourself in, and this being an Interplay game, there are some weird spots you'll find yourself in. The variety / diversity helps make the world and your characters feel more immersive and more in-control. An example is at the bar in Quartz. You can hop onto a stage and get into a battle sequence, only to be forced to preform for the audience afterwards. So you have your charisma attribute and some skills like knife throw to entertain the audience before they let you back down, but if your skills are too low or if you're just unlucky, you're going to find yourself being pelted with tomatos and beer bottles.I love the quirkiness of the game, it reminds me of the Fallout universe which is inspired by this game and also made by Interplay. The wastes are a strange place, with settlements ran by strange people, such as Faran Brygo. (obviously referencing Brian Fargo) You'll even find yourself dealing with the occult in this game, something having to do with an item called the ""bloodstaff"". I won't spoil anything though.Did I mention you can get Wasteland Herpes from a 3-legged hooker?The combat in this game is nothing special. It's simple and entertaining enough, but sometimes you find yourself running into encounter after encounter and it's so annoying. Also, if you don't memorize the keyboard shortcuts or put the macro creator to good use (ctrl+function), you're going to find yourself dealing with an annoying, clunky layout. Besides the minor annoyance, it won't be hard to learn.There's not really much to say about this game, it's a classic and rightfully so. I'm not a huge RPG guy but this is an RPG I find myself coming back to every now and again because of how much fun it is. It has an easy to follow story, atmopsheric enviornments, great music, great characters and dialogue, and that wasteland quirkiness we all know and love. I definitely recommend this game to anybody looking to play a great retro RPG, or anyone who's interested in the origin of Wasteland / Fallout.Also, if you haven't picked it up already, be glad it's $5.99 and not the $14.99 I spent when it was first released on steam... well, I'd say the $14.99 was well worth it."

Don't get me wrong, it was par for the course at the time. But compared to it's spiritual successor Fallout and basically any modern game. Playing it today will make it apparent how dated the game is.While dated is a very strong word to throw at this game, if you've played a tabletop RPG in your lifetime and have an afternoon to kill Wasteland is a fairly engaging game. It portrays a post apocalyptic wasteland fairly well, and it has a lot of personality. Just bare in mind that it's not going to wow you, and you will have to print out a reference card and potentially the entire manual to properly understand the controls and storyline."
,Recommended,259130,7849876,"Posted: 30 November, 2013",all,grymmjack,"I REMEMBER THIS FONDLYI used to love playing  this on my old Apple 2e. Me and my friends would huddle around the computer and play coop before it even existed. Each of us created unique characters inside of Ranger Station slamming on the SPACEBAR forever to roll up the best stats and get the best points. We essentially would play cooperatively on 1 computer where we would take turns actually using the computer. The player would type and move around, while the other people simply watched the game and spoke aloud what they wanted their characters to do. ""Attack, Burst, Leather Thug to the left"". ""Disband, move up."" This last statement our close combat character would literally say 100 times each session. It  was all part of the fun, and while it sounds  painful, it was actually a blast. We'd make our party consisting of a ""gun guy"", a ""brawler"", a ""doc"", and a ""nerd"".The gun guy we'd load up with gun skills like SMG and Assault Rifle (M1989A1 NATOs baby!) and AT Weapon, this guy was clutch for making sure he shot and actually hit stuff in the game, where even if you have a really good DEX stat you might not hit what you shoot unless you take the skill too.The brawler would get pugilism and melee weapon skills (basically a tank in close quarter combat) and of course he'd get dibs on the Manglers and Clubs and stuff. Of course he never really relied only on melee and could take out some punks at a distance with a .45 or whatever. The doc is well, a medic with loads of Medic skill and a ridiculous INT stat, and the nerd was a well-rounded character that had a maximum INT but took skills that were not medic; forgery, metallurgy, lockpick, etc.IT IS NOT EASYI can't tell you how many hours of my life I spent huddled in front of the glow of my color composite monitor swapping disks playing Wasteland. It is a brutally difficult game by todays standards with permadeth period. No options for ressurection unless you save your game ahead of time, when you die you're dead. Perhaps part of what made this game so compelling to me and my friends was that we actually had to focus, use our brains for team work, and have a strategy instead of just mindless button mashing like we were doing on our NESes with Rush'n'Attack, Rygar, and Ikari Warriors (among others). We would die often and we would regroup and rethink of our strategy. We would pick better skills learn more about the attributes and when they played a role and for what and this whole time we were actually having a boatload of fun. I can remember TPD (total party death) once we reached Las Vegas ♥♥♥♥♥♥I remember this happening in Quartz too, the game is freaking hard and the deck is definitely not stacked in your favor) as we got shredded to pieces by a cyborg with energy weapons (up until then we didn't even know energy weapons existed). It took hours to rebuild, start over, and level up to be strong enough to get back to Las Vegas and actually take those bots down.AND WE CHEATEDWe used to build 4 characters in Ranger Station, only 1 of which would we actually try to make decent. This character was the ""courier"" he would be escorting the cannon fodder other 3 characters straight to Quartz, where they would sell EVERY piece of gear they owned, then he'd Pool the money and walk them back to Range Station, and we'd delete them. Do this 100 - 300 times, and you can amass an enormous cache of weapons, armor, money, etc. Then when  you have your loot and gear all sorted, you build 3 other characters and you give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about them too. After those 3, we would give the couriers♥♥♥♥♥♥to another remaning character either kill the courier to create a better character, or sometimes we'd just keep him. We used macros to automate most of this. In essence, this is cheating against the spirit of the game, but it was ♥♥♥♥ing  hard and we were young and thought we were clever. I can tell you even then it wasn't always easy after. Yes we might have SMG's and NATO Assault rifles with boatloads of clips and TNT and Kevlar armor, but we still got our asses handed to us in Vegas.WE NEVER BEAT ITWe got ver close to beating the game, but we could never find the Sleeper Base to make it to space.IT IS OLD THOUGH...I know, right? It' s pretty old, and it doesn't age super well. If you didn't grow up playing this game you might hate it. If you can get past the old-ness of the game, the graphics even with this re-release are not great, the SA antialiasing helps, but I kinda like the crunchy pixels better. The music and the voice overs are pretty awesome in this version; we had a paragraph book we'd use to read from (which doubled as a form of copy protection).If you like oldschool RPGs that are top-down (like Ultima, or 2400AD) and you are ready to commit to actually trying to win (if that's your thing) and don't mind getting your♥♥♥♥♥whipped until you learn some tricks and techniques, this game will reward you.There is a lot of game in ths small package, and there is a lot of personality and character that this game had that no other game did. EA innovated on many fronts with Wasteland, and not just in the computer but the paragraphs really added a ton of story and immersion to the game that other RPGs of the time lacked sorely. It was like living in the best ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" (don't get be started about how awesome those books were in my childhood) computer game ever made.THIS WAS WHAT STARTED THE FALLOUT(s)If you're a fan of Fallout at all, you will probably like this game. It takes time and dedication, but this is the precursor to all the others. For that reason alone you should check it out, but the game has tons of merit as well, and the re-release really does try to polish an old title to a more modern standard. I think it does a pretty good job, but I had some issues getting the mouse to work. The keyboard is the way to go and it works no problem.GIVE IT A SHOT I RECOMMEND ITYou needed an imagination in the old days, and you still need it today, but the voice overs really do help make this game a lot better than it was. The music is OK too. Is it going to blow your mind? Probably not. Is it going to keep you coming back, maybe. Is it going to make you work for the reward of the story? Without a doubt.Wasteland is one of my favorite games and I highly recommend it."
,Recommended,259130,11114305,"Posted: 7 July, 2014",all,bobert awful (F+),"Wasteland is a product of its own time - low-res graphics, clumsy user interface, and a habit of not exactly telling you how to accomplish things like, say, giving the Visa card to Head Crusher (the game wants you to use one member of your party and put the Visa card on the seat you were previously sitting in opposite of Head Crusher, rather than, say, walking up to him and giving it to him directly).This was fine back in the day. This is because that game was released in the era of computing known as The Bad Old Days, where you had to manually configure your PCI/ISA cards to avoid IRQ conflicts, where you had to make DOS Bootdisks to free up enough memory just to get the damn video game running, where you could write a little graphical menu in DOS where you could park the heads of your incredibly expensive 10 MB hard drive. You know, just in case the FBI comes around to ask you why you've been pirating so much goddamn software to the rest of your Warez buddies on the BBS networks. Computer users had to put up with a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥just to get games like Wasteland running, and so games like these were walks in the park compared to knowing the exact DOS commands to Telnet into the Matrix or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that.This version of the game runs entirely in a custom emulation environment. It includes a custom soundtrack written by a fan which is pretty cool. The game also allows you to read the paragraphs inside the game (complete with voice overs) when it asks you to read paragraph 38 or another random arbitrary number. The storytelling is pretty good. Other than that, it's pretty much just like the old PC version, which is as accessible to new players as noise music is to regular people. It will definitely make the old, bearded crowd sigh and reminisce about The Bad Old Days.I recommend you give this about five hours, read a summary and the paragraph book, and then wait for Wasteland 2 to finish up."

There is plenty of guides on the internet however so this should not be too big of a problem. Its 26 years old and in my opinion is better than 98% of those mindless games that come out today.

It has a non-linear design, customizable character statistics and skills and multiple puzzle solutions. Especially the last point gives you the chance to advance with a variety of tactics. You can open closed door with the lockpicking ability, or you use the climb skill, or force it open with a crowbar or blow it up with a rocket launcher.Your group starts with four people and can be extended to seven members by recruiting certain civilians and creatures. And you should do it as fast as possible, because this game has a high and sometimes unforgiving difficulty level.Most people will be discouraged by the outdated graphics and initially rough gameplay. But if you are willing to give this game a chance, you will experience a classic role-playing game with all its charms and challenges.Achievements:The game has no Steam achievements."

This game is better than many of its successors and that includes Fallout (which I also adore). The main difference here is a shocking amount of freedom and the sense of playing a pen and paper RPG.  If you can use your imagination and role play you will love this game. The patch that added a soundtrack really made a great difference.

And I don't mean the graphics.- Unbelievably frustrating in many sections of the game, specifically with enemies that go from too easy to unbelievably hard, using items in specific locations, and not having specific items for critical parts to progressing the storyline. The pacing is awful.- Too easy to screw yourself on character creation, with little tools to help explain the game.- Items have no description, so you'll have a hard time understanding what does what without looking it up on the Wasteland Wikia.- Ironman mode always, as the game auto saves with every room you enter. You might get trapped in a room with no way out because you don't have a key and you don't have the pick lock skill. Things like this are EVERYWHERE in this game.+ I'm so glad though that a game like this released so many years ago, for it set a standard for this kind of game that has (for the most part) only gotten better with time.

,Recommended,259130,12211065,"Posted: 23 September, 2014",all,Arcadian Del Sol,"Once upon a time, long before Nintendo and Sony, when the ""PC Master race"" was still in it's larval stage, there was The Bard's Tale. There were no 3D graphics cards, or surround sound features. There was just a glorified text adventure with a few pixels of color to give you an idea where you were, what you were doing, and what that giant robotic scorpion that just destroyed your entire group 'sort of' looked like.Computer games were more tabletop than arcade - the best parts of them took place entirely in your own imagination. When Wasteland appeared, it was from another world. No wizards and swords and dragons. There were guns, goth chicks who spit on the ground, and horribly demented bad guys named after Donald Duck's nephews. The game only gave you 10 words to describe each and every one of them, but in the world of the imagination, they were tough, gritty, and completely bad♥♥♥♥♥Technology and the capacity of the human mind to always make things better than they once were has left this classic behind - to the degree that it is now sustained purely by nostalgia than actual contribution. To speak of Wasteland to today's League of Legend's addicts is to listen to the haunting tails of the first appearance of the motorcar, whose alarmly breakneck speed of 10 MPH was fueled by the doomed souls of hell hosted sinners.So I do recommend this game - but only if you approach it as an automated, self-mastered table top RPG. You will be given brief snippets of data, and your imagination will be expected to fill in the gaps. Essentially, this game is only as amazing as you are willing to make it."

I can't say for sure since I never played the IBM version, but I believe that is the version being bundled with Wasteland 2. Take it from me, the IBM versions of games that were published in the '80's were the WORST available. (Games then were published in 3 PC formats-- IBM, Apple, and Commodore. The IBM PC had the worst graphics, and thus the inferior games.) I played WASTELAND for probably hundreds of hours on the Commodore, and I loved it. But I can't stand the version available here."

For one, it's the godfather of the Fallout games... but don't let that fool you. First of all, this came out 9 years before Fallout 1, and it shows. Graphics quality is low, of course, and combat is the type of turn based Pokemon had in the first generation, but instead of showing you and your enemy, it just shows a profile of what you enemy supposedly looks like, just to show you something other than text. Second of all, the differences in Fallout and Wasteland are very obvious, story-wise. I'm not going to go into details here, but the apocalypse in Wasteland happened in the late 90's. The 1990's that is. So yeah, that's just some perspective.Overall... most parts of this game have not aged... well. They haven't aged badly, per se, but they have aged. Graphics quality is low, as you should expect from a game in the late 80's. The combat is, as I said above... iffy. The story, however, is great. The writing is also great. But then, comedy and satire always age relatively well.For me, having not played this when I was younger like most people who will buy this game (people born in the 80's, or earlier I mean), and only having messed around with it in DOSbox (not a very... shall we say, fun situation), I think it's done well enough over the years for me to say that this is still a good game. The addition of the paragraphs and voice over also make this game so much easier to experience than in DOSbox, seeing how most people don't actually have copies of the original Paragraph booklet anymore.But yeah. I'm going to say this game is still fun, almost 30 years later, and reccomend it to everyone who wants a taste of what Fallout was before it was Fallout and/or want to experience an old game with some new updates."

Bugs and all, it is so awesome. My tip for those who are new is to play with a guide, just to make sure you dont run into any game breaking bugs! Thanks for reading!::Wasteland!I have amazing memories playing this with my dad back when I was just a child; creating our characters with our names and different skills and tools, to help us survive the Mojave and Arizona deserts. It is so great to be able to experiance it again as an adult, and actually be able to appreciate what it has done for today's day and age of gaming for western RPG's. It helped spawn an amazing post-apocalyptic genre for everyone to enjoy, one of the first (I'm pretty sure) to come out with a persistant world that changes with you and your choices (and this is all in 1988!) While I have my nostalgia fix on the review, I will be honest with it also.This. Game. Is. ♥♥♥♥ing. Buggy.I had a game breaking bug. It really sucked to. It was underneath the sewers in Vegas. To advance the story and get a key item and location to be revealed on a map, you have to build a robot. The tables you build it on, for whatever reason, decides to not respond to my characters  actions when trying to put items on it.Twenty hours into my adventure and I'm stuck, against my own ♥♥♥♥ing will, because of a dumbass un-built robot. Underneath Vegas, in the ♥♥♥♥ing sewers. ♥♥♥♥ that. And ♥♥♥♥ this awesome game.There are others bugs in it as well, like the engine it is built on being extremely easy to exploit enemies on. The ""Super Loot Bag"" trick that I refuse to use. But besides this, I can't personally say there is anything else wrong with it. People will obviously state that the graphics haven't ""aged"" well, and to that I would say that they are an idiot because this was made in 1988. Don't play a game, that is dated to begin with, and try and compare it to something newly released or released in that particular's game next decade.Play this game. Bugs and all.

The game is a masterpiece and truly mindblowing to think that a game of this scale and depth was made in 1988, when computer could just about manage your basic text editor and 64 colour graphics. It might look and play absolutely terribly by todays standards, not letting you see your battles or encounters ther than a few onscreen messages and looking completely like a game of it's era, with very hefty pixels and almost laughable character design, but, the game is one of it's kind, offering something that was unheard of in 1988, an RPG, that was set on earth, with humans, in a dystopian futuristic wasteland of a 21st century gone bad. This game was basically the precurssor to the first 2 Fallout games, and it shows, in terms of overall design and gameplay, they're nearly identical, albeit, a bit more pixelated. It's really the kinda game you damn well need to look for the PDF of the manual that comes with the game, find the nearest printer, and print off into a small book and find the nearest walkthrough, or else you're going to be in for a bad time. It's almost impossible to understand just what the hell is going on. Wasteland is also probably the hardest game on Steam (yes, the entirety of Steam, I've never come across a game so frustratingly difficult, almost insulting at times as it's possible to get killed amost as soon as you enter a new area), but aside from that, Wasteland is a great game and is by far the best game of the 1980's. It really is one of the few games (the others being XCOM/UFO and in FPS terms, DOOM) that took games into places never thought possible, replacing tired, arcade mechanics with rich, deep storylines and immersive gameplay. It's the kind of game that you have to be in a 1988 mindset to even play, as I'm sure the majority of people will buy it on a Steam sale and play it for 30 minutes before abandoning it, but that would be doing it an injustice.

I'm not that far into the game, but there is no compelling story or ""quest system"" in the game.  When you start the game you just spawn on the map.  No story, no initial quest.  You're just there.  There are quests to do in each town, but no quest system, or anything to help you keep track of important information.

76561198025719393,Recommended,259130,29645567,Posted: 2 February,all,gv_eskimo,"(wonder why it takes forever for reviews to appear)First and foremost. This is a Classic, I even enjoyed it once I got past the ""everyone dies far too often stage"".  Would I recommend it for any other purpose than ""you should have played it""? No, it's an utter nightmare to play and that issue stands even more now than back in 1988. So Recommend Yes/No gets a 51% thumbs up ;)If you still think you should suffer through it, I'll explain my comment. With proper guidance you can enjoy it (and without you will probably play it 2-3 times longer than required).I played through every RPG I could gethold of back in the CMB64/early PC days and finished almost all. I would like to say all the Ultimas, Bard's tales, AD&D etc were completed but Wasteland... it was the first RPG I even gave up on.  Followed by Ultima IX because it was a buggy action adenture with millimeter movement and Ultima Underworlds because for some reason they bored me to death.So what was wrong with Wasteland? Spoilers warning, although very minimal!Insanely difficult without extra help. No internet and a 300baud modem wasn't worth enough. So I died from radiation, heat exhaustion, not enough safe places to rest, certainly never had enough Medics (or managed to walk to Doctors in time), always run out of ammo and finally tossed the entire♥♥♥♥♥♥game when I met the Scorpitron (the Vegas nightmare if I remembered the name wrong :) ).This time I almost tossed it out after beating bunnies forever right at the beginning. But I figured I will do it with a walkthrough and minimize time spent suffering. And I'm glad I did, the story is great and once you get to doctor stages and finally some decent armour it's almost fun.But I STILL suffered. After 33h of play to complete it I will list some of the noticeable annoyances. Veterans will laugh at some and hopefully not nod at the last one.Oh, and I'm a packrat. So I almost hauled every knife to a shop (ok, not in THIS game). That explains why it took so long. Oh, and my characters never die, EVER. Except in this game, good riddance.The horrors:1) Save and save often (and take backups of your saves). I didn't actually have to revertto saves all that often (except with the Scorpitron and on more place I cannot remember)  After hitting a mine twice in two moves in Vegas and losing Ace and not realizing it before saving the next time I considered going back a few hours in saves but naaaah.2) Not enough ammo, ever. Yes, I actually run out of 7.62 clips around Vegas so I had to chainsaw a while. My own fault, packrat and not wanting to switch weapons styles according to ammo.3) Half working macros. Well, without macros I would never EVER have played through this nightmare. Unfortunatley they had some cutting off limit so with 7 characters the last character had to evade to get proper A1S etc combos for the first 6. Only 1 single character left at that point :(4) You can apparently drop crucial items and the game become impossible to complete. There were a few items I could never find again even though I always sold stuff to be sure. The Darwin upper shop closed forever at some point though so maybe my stuff was there.5) At the end I needed two plasma couplers and there was only one in Cochise. The walkthrough said there should be one more on robots outside but never found one. I actually had to GRIND my characters up two levels to get 3 skill points into IQ and get Toaster repair. If I would have ended up with unplayable at that stage I would have tossed the damn thing or tried to hack items. Seriously, sheeeesh.6) And the biggie. Finishing off the game at 1 am (yes, it was good enough for a 2-3 last late run)... and I apparently made it unfinisable and had to revert to a save 2h earlier (famous words: ""not much left, just do it""). Why? When doing the last cylinder the game popped up some message and I hit space (being tired and all). After which I was locked away in a small room and that was it. I pretty much always played with a full party as I just wanted to finish the damn thing off. So the final solution was a really NASTY one. In 1988 without help and no disk scumming saves I think I would have forced the disk down Fargo's throath at that point.Ok, there you have it, suffer if you want but I really recommend a walkthrough because the game is so aged suffering just because of the good story simply isn't worth it. And one mistake 10h before the finish might leavy you hanging if you happen to drop something crucial by mistake.Veterans hopefully had a blast reading this. Ithink you all really recommend this because you want everyone else to suffer as you did...? :D"

Controls are terrible: tons of menus, a few hotkeys, not enough macros. The gameplay is terrible: literally useless skills, little reason not to kill everyone, 30 matches takes as much space as 30 assault rifles.Wasteland is a great game for anyone with the nostalgia or appreciation.  However, the latter is lacking among most, so the game cannot be recommended.9/10"

If not- very unlikely that you will enjoy this game with its very archaic interface and control system.And the price for this game by itself is ridiculous. 5.99$? A dollar – may be. Though, it still will be too much for this relict."

Sure, I can see that, but fallout is a type of game that takes a genre and defines it. This game just happened to be first. Sometimes being first to the genre doesn't mean you're the best...In 2014, however this game is literally a joke. It can't be played easily, crashes a lot, and the story is about as bad as you can imagine, but hey it was the 80s, and the 80s sucked. This is no exception. You get the same rehashed descriptions on most things, strange technicolor graphics, confusing UI, no AI, this game should have been designated KIA and never revived. Do not buy this game, do not waste your money as it comes in Wasteland 2 for free... and that's even a raw deal because WL2 is buggy with a strange UI and a lot of text. It's basically a novel on strings.Now let the wasteland fanboys down vote this so they can sleep at night, despite even them knowing this game sucks."

We were totally enthralled with the game, and played it as often as we could.  I'd say this game was one of the most pivotal in my early gaming days, and along with Starflight I and II paved the way for the kind of games I would enjoy most in adulthood.It's a classic, and definitely worth a spin."
