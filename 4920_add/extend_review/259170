,Not Recommended,259170,11133123,"Posted: 8 July, 2014",all,Vivian James,"Just a warning to users: I tried to run the game, and Securom gave me an error that it couldn't activate -- looking into it, the error was because I monitor the cpu usage of my PC using a process explorer.  Looking into the matter, Securom states blatantly that they don't like that process explorer software can monitor what Securom does, and therefore, they will never allow Securom applications to run while a process explorer is open; not only is that shady, but it's downright crap.  So buyer beware, this product still has Securom and still requires Stardock activation.  And yes, this is the old rootkit securom that will actually close your process explorer software after it's been installed and activated.That having been said, Alone in the Dark itself is a bit of a mess of a game.  The controls are pretty bad, this is in part due to their choosing to make arm controls based on the right-hand joystick on a 360 gamepad (it's even worse on PC if you don't have a gamepad).  The graphics are good, really good (especially considering this game came out in 2008).  The gameplay can be questionable at times, and some mechanics are used for the first 5 minutes after they're introduced, and then never again.  An example of this is the blinking mechanic, it's used to clear your vision when you start out the game, but after this point you won't be using it again.The physics puzzles often involve moving Edward's arms to manipulate certain objects in certain directions, and while this was a good idea in theory, it should have had a toggle button for this type of manipulation, as it translates poorly to combat.  Edward will often♥♥♥♥♥♥the object back as if to swing it, only to slowly lower it because of how clunky the controls to this particular function work.The game assumes you've played previous games and gives no introduction to Edward or Theophile, only mentioning events from previous games in passing, as well doing nothing to inform us what happened in the months and hours leading up to the game.  The game starts off in the middle of the story, and you as the player are given little exposition until nearing the end of the game on what is actually going on.The good portions of the game are non-gameplay portions, and involve the inventory, as the player selects items and combines them in Edward's coat, such as combining a glowstick with a piece of tape to make a sticky glowstick that you can throw onto walls and ceilings to help illuminate the area.  Likewise one can combine gasoline and handgun ammo to make incendiary ammunition (which is needed to kill demon enemies).The game uses a location-based damage system similar to Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth (although that game did it better), and the player applies bandages and healing spray to repair these wounds.  The problem is that wounds often require multiple items per wound, and you don't get anywhere near enough of these, and if you suffer a bleeding wound you'll be forced to use up the majority of your healing items to repair it.There was a lot of things about Alone in the Dark that were good ideas, but with bad implementation, and unfortunately Eden Games and Hydravision Entertainment got liquidated before they could release the patch that was supposed to make the 360 and PC versions play like the updated Alone in the Dark: Inferno for PS3.  The game itself can be enjoyable, but it's hard to make a recommendation to buy any game that requires a person to install and activate a rootkit to play.  So this combined with all the negatives (of which there are plenty) is why I do not recommend this to people; instead try and get your hands on the PS3 version."
,Recommended,259170,11147326,"Posted: 9 July, 2014",all,AestheticGamer,"Alone in the Dark is a 2008 action survival-horror game, and fifth game in the Alone in the Dark series. It is also one of the most profound and fascinating examples I have ever played of something akin to a glorious train-wreck.There's a story here, I'm sure of it. There are definitely cutscenes with unforgettable hammy acting and dialogue, with such excellent writing and voicing execution like ""I don't have your stone, and ♥♥♥♥ you anyway,"" or, ""I'm the ♥♥♥♥-ING UNIVERSE!!"" However, I couldn't rightfully tell you it without looking up a synopsis. I guess New York is in trouble, so there's that.Alone in the Dark is daring, different, and truly there is no other game quite like it. In this game, you'll find yourself doing everything from racing a car through Central Park as giant bats tear your car apart as you drive it, only to form themselves into a literal giant bat tornado.You will learn the importance of tape with a surprisingly complex crafting system that existed long before Minecraft. You'll drive a forklift through a cave and pick up rocks and bridges. You'll literally be♥♥♥♥♥♥out by a giant worm.If anything, I can say it was ahead of its time. For a 2008 game, it tried things that would later on become parts of much more successful and bigger games, and gaming elements that have become popularized. Climbing segments with things crumbling apart ala' Uncharted before Uncharted. The after-mentioned crafting item system the game features. First-person 'experience' walking simulator sections. This game was ahead of the curveball on what would be hip several years from the time it released.It just pulled off most of them pretty poorly.Honestly, the task of things you'll be doing before this game is up is ridiculous. The developers clearly had huge ambitions, but didn't have the time or budget to polish off its ideas. So what you have is a game that controls a bit weirdly, suffers from some hilarious glitches, and somehow tries to wrap up every ridiculous thing that happens into some sort of logical story. Sometimes the game wants to be an atmospheric horror game, other times it wants to be an action game, others a surrealistic platformer, or why not take a moment to take part in a firefighter simulator?The game even went ahead of itself and made it into an episodic gameplay experience. Split into episodes, the game will literally let you play almost any episode or part of an episode from the very beginning of the game. At any time you are free to skip ahead (or go backwards) in the games storyline... With one exception. You have to complete all the episodes (and partake in one quest involving burning roots in an open-world hub world of Central Park) to play the last episode. I can only think the reason they did this is because they realized a few parts of their game were needlessly difficult, usually because of controls.This game also has a Soundtrack that it honestly does not deserve, but adds so much to the experience. You'll be listening to over-the-top child orchestras and epic tunes as you drive in a collapsing New York in a taxi that controls like butter. And most of the soundtrack keeps this epic, mysterious tone full of orchestra songs and some just excellent pieces of music that make it feel like the game is telling some deep epic, when most of the time you'll probably have no idea what's going on. The music just adds to the glorious train wreck that this game is.If you're like me, you'll be playing this and telling yourself that this is a terrible game, and just exclaim out at some new element that baffles on why they decided to go with THIS direction on something, but all the same you'll find yourself both curious, and even excited on what may be around the next bend.The game isn't all bad, it has interesting ideas, sections, and I would even say the game has some good fun to be had, but it is plagued with problems, and just goes so hilariously and over the top off the rails its almost awe-inspiring. Its problems are somewhat front-loaded, so if you can bear through some sort of dull beginning sections, the game has several loaded guns of things to experience ahead for you, and if you can get past the beginning, you are almost certain to enjoy the crazy ride this game provides.If someone ever asked me to point them in the direction of the purest B-horror game ever, I would point them to this game. It is the hammiest, corniest, most over-the-top horror game I've ever played. It is ridiculous from start to finish, and it is for this reason I'd recommend this.Know though the PC version suffers from some problems, mainly some people have trouble running it. Solutions to get around, but still. And the 'best version' of the game is actually on PS3, as it contains an additional chapter and fixes several problems and inputted some better controls.Still, if you want a B-Horror game, look no further than Alone in the Dark."

,Recommended,259170,7868276,"Posted: 1 December, 2013",all,Psykhophear™,"Alone In The Dark was a promising game when it first came out in 2008; it had a great storyline and some cool game mechanics that involved playing with fire (which is awesome) but the main problem it had back then that still holds true now, unfortunately, is the control itself. The game uses fixed camera angles where the player controls Edward Carnby like a tank and the game mechanics as a whole feels stiff and outdated. It's as if the developer tries to emulate the controls from the original Alone In The Dark and bring it to the next-gen and although it sounds like a cool idea on paper but in reality - it's not.The supporting characters are mediocre as well with an annoying female partner named Sarah and an uninspiring antagonist named Crowley. Everything about them is boring and they just don't provide any sense of motivation into the story. It reminds you of that abysmal movie adaptation by Uwe Boll, which was originally supposed to coincide with the game but thankfully, it didn't happen.Despite its flaws, Alone In The Dark is still fun to play. If you get pass the fact of its stiff controls and awful driving sequence (good luck trying to finish the earthquake scene on your first playthrough), you'll learn that the soundtrack is outstanding and the weapon manipulation is really intuitive. It's incredibly satisfying to blow up stuff with a fire-induced gun and home-made explosives. It's just too bad the publisher has not released any patches to fix these problems until now. But then again, it's Atari; what do you expect?For me, I appreciate Alone In The Dark for what it is so I give it a thumbs up for an ambitious attempt. If you really want to experience the game in its entirety, I suggest getting the PlayStation 3 version that addresses all the gameplay issues found in the PC and Xbox 360. If you don't have any consoles at all, then you're stuck with the PC version. Either get it when it's on sale or don't get it at all. Your choice."

Both innovative and frustrating, to call this game anything but unique would be a crime. I'm a huge horror fan (both games and film) and this was definietly an enjoyable ride. Yes, this game has it's quirks (both good and bad) but if you can look past 'the bad' then you are sure to have a fun time.Just think of this as a PS1 game with new graphics. If you can enjoy old games and not get hung up on some control frustration then you should pick this up. I pad $2.50 and was very pleased.I played this on Windows XP so I had no issues with changing resolution in-game. I read a lot about the 'display options crashing' and counted myself lucky to have both Win. 7 and Win. XP. Not once did the game crash.My biggest conplaint is the ending. DON'T expect a solid conclusive ending. The ride was worth it though.7.8/10"
,Not Recommended,259170,12851552,"Posted: 8 November, 2014",all,clint,"This game is a little disaster. It shows what an uninspired port can do to what might have been a decent game. Slowly I begin to understand why Infogrames/Atari went downhill so fast.I've been playing AitD back then in 1993 and loved the atmosphere, the puzzles and how the story did unfold. But this sequel discouraged me to play even before it started. Technical issues (resolution has to be set manually in a config file) gave me a bad feeling right from the start. But it got worse when I realized that the effort put into porting it from console to PC was minimal at best.The greatest flaw is the hoplessly overcomplicated and unintuitive UI and control system. You are confronted with a myriad of keys needed to do things which you'll quickly forget afterwards, just to wonder what might have been ""blinking"" (no kidding) once your eysight is blurring again.But even worse is the way you have to move around. Pressing W to move forward while needing A and D to steer left and right might have been a decent input system for 1993. But it isn't really working for a game which forces you to walk on thin ledges while all kinds of debris is raining down on you. To make it even worse, the 3rd person cameras are so bad, that you feel like a drunkard stumlbing disorientedly around when you try to navigate even a small room.The puzzles are illogic. In one situation you need to lift a fire extinguisher to a collapsed floor above you. Now every sane person with two working arms would simply lift the extinguisher to platform one, climb up and repeat it.Oh no! The developers of this game thought it natural to put the extinguisher on a platform, which is connected to a rope, which in turn is dangling down from the ceiling... so all you need to do further is to climb up the collapsed floor to leap 2 meters above the ground to the dangling rope to grab it somehow in midair, just to pull the platform (remember, the one we put the extinguisher on?) up so the extinguisher is airbone to land on the second floor.Phew.Okay... seriously?Annoyed as I am I don't even wish to mention the mediocre voice acting or the clicheéd horror snippets happening to anonymous people all around you. It's really not worth the effort, you know them all. Or the music which tries to create suspense, but is quickly starting to annoy you, because it's nowhere close to be dynamically linked to the action on the screen.Anyways... don't buy it, unless you are a die hard AitD fan who just needs to know what happened to the series by first-hand-experience. Hope you got a gamepad then."

You'll probably get as far as the Options screen, but if you click on Display the whole thing will crash to desktop. Given that Atari as a company has dissolved and its assets stricken to the four winds, the only solutions available on hand are:1) Play this game on a PC with more modest videocard specs2) Download someone else's ""res.aitd"" resolution config file (or make one of your own), copy-paste it into the appropriate user AppData folder location and hope you won't get stuck on a looping intro screen animation with no menu items3) Purchase Alone in the Dark: Inferno on PS3 instead4) Grit your teeth and accept that some things in life are just not meant to beFurther details:http://steamcommunity.com/app/259170/discussions/0/611701999519746944/Additionally, while the game does support Xbox360 controllers, it will NOT automatically detect it at game start up. Instead, you need to go into the Options -> Configuration screen, click on one of the default keyboard control keys as if to rebind it, and then hit any of the buttons on the controller: whereupon the game asks if you want to rebind the controls to the controller and will do all of it automatically if you click on ""yes"". And you will still need to use the mouse to exit the Configuration screen because the controls won't take effect until you leave that particular menu item. Fiddly, but easily solvable.Now as for starting an actual new game itself, I have two words: good luck. You might be fortunate enough that the game will start if you change your speaker settings from 5.1 (or what other setup you may have) to Stereo. Which is a silly thing but it's worked for some people. I am not one of those some people. I am one of the 4) people whose moderately beefy machine specs have rendered an 8+ year old game unplayable. Apparently upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10 might help but that requires upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10.Well, this is a good a time as any to build an archive machine for playing older Windows games, I guess..."

,Not Recommended,259170,22271028,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,Mellow_Online1,"What the hell happened to this franchise? Alone in the dark was a classic survivl horror and was the basis of what would become the popular Resident Evil franchise, however, newer games with new ideas started coming out and Alone in the Dark was left out in the dust. Atari quickly put their minds to work and decided to resurrect this forgotten franchise but make it fit in with the new demographic of gamers by taking out everything that made Alone in the Dark great and adding in every sort of cliche in horror game history.Gameplay is the biggest thing that's been butchered in Alone in the Dark as it literraly doesn't live up to it's name. You're not alone because there are tons of people that will follow you around at some point and you're rarely in the dark. You can play the game from a first or third person perspective but the controls for both of these perspectives are terrible. When in first person, your sight is limited to what you can see an you'll most likely get stuck on something and half the time, you won't even know what you're stuck on. In third person, the controls feel restricted and you'll struggle to pull of basic actions in the game. The camera is awful in the third person view because your mouse is terrible for controlling the camera and it constantly fights with you. I failed doing a certain jump near the beginning of the game and it took me 6 attempts to get right because the camera switched perspectives when I went to jump. There are a few gameplay elements which seemed like good ideas but weren't used up to their full potential. The inventory management is one of them. In game, when you want to look through your inventory, the game doesn't pause and you need to look down at your shirt and actually select the items you want to use which is a great idea but, you might be shocked to hear this, the controls suck in the inventory screen. You will constantly try and navigate over to a certain item that you want, only for the game to take you to an item that you've never needed before. The game is also buggy as hell and some bugs will prevent you from proceeding with the game.The story is that Mr. forgettable and unlikeable main character wakes up shortly before he is meant to be killed by some men for whatever reason and the thing is Mr. forgettable and unlikeable main character can't remember anything about himself. However some weird creatures stop him from being killed and he escapes the building with a little bit of information about his task and he also escapes with Ms. Obvious girlfriend for unlikeable and forgettable main character. So the 2 go out and try and complete the task he's been given and also figure out who he is. By a horror stand point, this plot has been done to death but most horror games add a unique thing to it to make their specific telling of this plot memorble. Alone in the Dark doesn't. It literraaly takes the bear bones of a plot structure and uses it as it's final product.Graphics are a mixed bag and the graphics is probably the best thing this game has going for it. Certain things in Alone in the Dark look amazing. The fire looks brilliant and it's great just to watch the fire spread across more of a surface. The game overall looks OK but there are quite a few badly textured things you will come across throughout playing Alone in the Dark. Sound is relatively bad aswell, mainly because some sounds are actually missing from th game, mainly in the SFX. Some sounds cut out randomly and for no reason at all aswell.The game is quite short for a horror game and you can complete it within about 12 hours (my timer counter is broken for this, probably because my steam account had mercy on me and it didn't want anyone else to know that I had played this game for 12 hours.) There is no reason to replay Alone in the Dark either because there are so many bad things that are included in this that youwill not want to put yourself through this torture anymore.This was meant to have been the great return of a classic survival horror video game series but instead we were left with a buggy, ugly and unfinished messFinal verdictPros+ Some great ideas+ Decent graphicsCons- Awful controls- Buggy as hell- Forgettable story- Unlikeable characters- Missing sounds- Some ugly texturesFinal verdict: 2/10Steam Curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews"

It did have some really good concepts, but overall it feels as if the climax was underwhelming compared to the intriguing build up.Either way, a 6/10.Not too good a game - but not bad either if you have about 10 hours to spend for a mediocre horror game."

There are sections of the game that are almost unplayable, such as the early car escape. Skip it! The game lets you! To get to the ""actual game"", fast forward to the chapter immediately following the car escape. AitD is by far at its best when it's a free-form open world roaming ""sim"", so play it that way.

Every episode will close with a nail-biting cliff-hanger ending to rattle players' nerves, and if the player is leaving the game a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave them wanting more.Alone in the Dark will provide a complete next-generation, action packed experience within a highly detailed, free roaming environment, featuring a mixture of real-time physics and full environmental interaction.

But i have Windows 10 and latest AMD drivers for R9 380 and i can run this game without any problems about resolution.Not many people might like this or even read this review, but i will write down my thoughts.In this game, you play as edward carnby, who wakes up to an amnesia, and try to identify yourself and the events going on around you. After a very nice introduction to yourself you will find yourself in the horror that shadows the whole world and you will try to solve mysteries with some allies.Short review:This is my favorite game. Very nice ambiance, exciting story, strong characters, thrilling survival and good looking visuals for its time, 2008. There are few glitches of the game but i think i can tolerate them. Resource and inventory management is crucial to survive. Music is fantastic. Controls are complicated but it creates variety of actions in gameplay. A very depressing open world game with a relatively big map for its own time. The story may not be much appealing or interesting for everyone but i think survival is enough to keep you playing.Long review:- Alone in the dark is a horror game. But the horror is not cliche jumsp scares or chasing. This is an openworld game with a very depressing and shivering environment. And conviniently the game takes place in the night :)- The rpg element of this game is edward carnby. He is trying to remember his past while also trying to run away from bad guys and creatures around him. The story of edward carnby is not only about his memories. It is also about his destiny with a shocking ending. There are also allies and enemies in the game and they all play a role in the story.- There is a very nice central park as the openworld in this game. You can drive cars around but some areas requires you to walk in. This is nt a walk in the park, i think this is a pun :D There are monsters cruising around just like you.- In this apocalyptic survival horror, you will need a weapon obviously. You only have one handgun but you can utilize it with other inventory objects. Inventory plays a very big role in this game. For example there are explosive bottles and you can throw them on to the enemy and shoot it in the air to blow it up. You have a lighter and you can use it with mosquito spray to creeate fire like a dragon. You can create a molotov with a piece of colth and an explosive bottle. Even more, you can wrap it with a bandage to make it stick on a surface or enemy. You can use your knife to penetrate the blood bags and create a path to a trap. Because some creatures are blood thirsty. And there are other inventory items and possibilities as creative as these. You will find items in the trashes or cars or in buildings or jsut in the middle of nowhere.- There is a healing mechanism in this game. If you take a critical hit, you will start beleeding. You should stop beleeding with bandage. If you get hurt, you can heal your wounds with a medical spray. Use and store it wisely.- The enemies in this game have a weakness. They show a specific fissure-like wounds and those places can be set on fire. So yeah you are basicaly burning zombies :) This is the efficient way of killing them. Your X-Ray vision is required to progress through the game and it gets enhanced as you kill evil roots of evilness. You will now what i mean if you play the game.- Fire is a usefull element. You will need fire extinguishers to extinguish fires.- There are 2 different cameras. First and third person views.- There are nice riddles in the game. You have to be creative to solve them.- The game is chapter based. There are 8 chapters with severals checkpoints. The good thing is that you can play or skip any chapters at any time. If you are stuck in a riddle, just skip that chapter or checkpoint. I did this in my first gameplay and completed all over again without skipping. There is a ""previously on alone in the dark"" kind of introduction at the beginning of every chapter. Which is another awesome aspect of this game. This game is the most cinamtic game i have ever played. Second is max payne 3. A not: James McCaffrey is the voice actor of both this game Edward Carnby and Max Payne 3 Max Payne.- The inventory items can be coupled with a shortcut. There are 4 shortcuts available and each one can be assigned to a specific button while pressing "" key. For example, a lither and a mosquito spray is a good combination. You can make a shortcut for these two by selecting them and assigning them. This way you will not have to switch hands or search your inventory, you will get your equipment ready to use if they are available in your inventory. Another example, you can mix your bullets with explosives and they can become burning bullets. You do not have to mix them everytime you reload your weapon. Just assign a shortcut with your gun with fire bullets. If you have explosive liquids, they will be automaticaly mixed with your weapons magazine.- The objects like a pipe can be weaponized in this game. You get a baseball bat or a peace of wood and swing it with you mose and hit the enemy with mouse click. You can also take a wooden chair, light it up by holding it into the fire, and strike the flammable enemies with it.- The game has the best music of all games i have ever played. Definitely suits for the ambiance and escence of the game.- The stroy is an end of the world apocalyptic scenario, which sounds lame, but it has revealing connections to people around you. This makes the game interesting. You will wonder what will happen and you will be shcoked at the end.And only one downside of this game as i can see. There are glitches and cheap deaths. Not much frequent but can be anoying sometimes. But i have never complained about anything because game is fantastic.This game has revolutionary ides of its time but i don't think much people even know about it. I loved every minute of it. It is cheap and if you have windows 10, just give it a try."
