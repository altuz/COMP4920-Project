,Recommended,259190,10441334,"Posted: 12 June, 2014",all,Dfactor,"Alone in the Dark (4): The New Nightmare is a 3rd person survival horror game which was released in 2001. Some may say that it's a ripoff (see Resident Evil), but that's not entirely true. AITD4 is a reboot of the series which is placed in modern times. There are two playable characters with different, but interconnected storylines (similar to RE2), both have average playtime of 4-5 hours. The game has unique soundtrack (created by Low Distortion Unit) which is really atmospheric, scary and menacing. The game offers you limited amount of ammo which strengthens the element of survival horror. It also has puzzles which aren't that difficult (if you actually read in-game's files). There are powerful weapons such as double barrel revolver, triple barrel shotgun, plasma cannon, grenade and rocket launchers and other special weapons. I should also mention that the game also utilized a flashlight which is used for seeing dark areas, for puzzle solving and even as a weapon (see Alan Wake). The PlayStation 2 and PC ports have better FMVs, models and backgrounds, runs at 60FPS, however, the music is badly ported and sounds barely like the original (PlayStation 1). The Steam version of the game has a broken launcher and that's why I suggest getting the GoG version instead (or have them both?). With the proper launcher you can select any rendering resolution, but only 4:3 resolutions are recommended.AITD is a truly scary game. The mixture of good soundtrack, atmosphere (including rain and thunder), flashes, sudden screams, supernatural monsters does it's job. Be sure to play at night and/or with headphones. Generally underrated game."

The story and the depth of it are most memorable, so for a game of its age, it does incredibly well. Due to change of hands, the title has been milked ever since, making this as the one and only decent game of its series. There are slight compatibility issues which are to be expected for such an old game, however there are several fixes out there. It's a shame that there was never a remake of this."

The music and the sound effects are very well made and give the game a good athmosphere. Overall runs faster than the Psone copy i still have!However, the game has its downsides. You can't change the resolution, so you'll be stuck on 640 x 480. Controller support is almost obsolete as well, even though i was trying to set my controls with my 360 controller, i'm thinking it might work on the arrow buttons on a rather older gamepad model. The cutscenes never show up, unless i alt+tab and by then the game might crash and quite frankly i don't want to do that every cutscene.Was it worth the 5.99€? Not necessarily, if it wasn't just a mere version of the 2001 copy. If they had actually cared about modern customers, they would've fixed all of those problems. Now i'm left thinking should i be mad that i wasted my 5,99€ on this game or do i keep playing putting the problems aside?I can't decide between recommending this game and not recommending, so i'll give it a thumbs up just for the nostalgia that i've got for the title. If you're expecting a fully working game, look away. If you don't mind about the half-bakedness of the game, pick it up."

It might have alot of bugs but I have not come across any bugs and the game has been really fun to play again, as I used to play it as a kid but never got a chance to finish it.If your a fan of Alone in the dark or a fan of resident evil, or any kind of horror game with jumpscares, this game is for you. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I will."
,Recommended,259190,8226594,"Posted: 23 December, 2013",all,Cumming while Crying In Japanese,"It can easily be argued that Alone in the Dark is the series that created the survivalhorror genre. The first game was released in 1992 for the MS-DOS and laid the groundworkfor the genre. After a couple sequels the series fizzed away, until Resident Evil camearound and recreated survival horror. So obviously the original had to come back to the fieldand compete, and what it came back with was Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare.game starts with Edward Carnby, a private detective, finding out that his partner isdead off the coast of Shadow Island. Edward soon learns of some ancient tablets that canunlock a secret power. Edward teams up with Aline to find the tablets and avenge his friend'sdeath. Their plane is attacked by some mysterious creature, forcing them to parachute, becomeseparated, and become stuck on Shadow Island.Here the game makes you decide which character you want to be, either Edward or Aline. Eachhas their own storyline and adventure, which intersects at certain points. The gameplayis what you would expect from a survival horror game. Your character controls like in ResidentEvil, where up moves forward and you pivot. The game also uses pre-rendered backgrounds,that are in fact very detailed and dark. The game has a great atmosphere that is mostlyfocused on darkness. You will grow to fear the darkness and the nightmare creatures thatlurk within it.And like most survival horror games, the game has a heavy emphasis on combat and puzzlesolving. What is different is, while both characters will see their fair share of both,one is more prevalent in each character’s campaign. Edward has his trusty double barreledrevolver and will always have it in hand. His story involves mostly fighting the nightmarecreatures. The enemies are very tough and ammo is scarce, making you have to know whento stand up and fight, and when to run away. Aline starts off in a huge mansion and mustsolve the puzzles littered through mansion to advance. It is interesting how they separatedthese two gameplay mechanics, allowing you to play the game the way you want. But whetheryou are solving puzzles or fighting monsters, the darkness will always be there.This is a great return of the original of the genre. With the separate campaigns andthe beautiful but dark graphics, the game is full of tricky puzzles and terrifying enemies.his is another strong reason why you should be afraid to be alone in the dark."

If anyone plays Resident Evil 1, should know this is somewhat similar in the gameplay, and game plot as well.Keep noted however, there are bugs and glitches in this game, so please save carefully. Also another note that the saves are limited so dont save too much, but you will earn some along the way, would suggest go scavenging on items and dont waste all ammo since enemies are either too much or endless to kill, they WILL come back at some point in some areas, excluding bosses of course.I was able to beat it while saving cautiously, so have fun and dont end up trapping yourself or otherwise you will have to restart all over again, that includes if used up all ammo and dont know a strategy to run through the enemies."

The New Nightmare is very spooky game with obscure plot,dark atmopshere and traditional horror-survival gameplay with fixed backgrounds .Technical ProblemsYou may need third party software to use some controlers properly . I was able to assign all buttons to a controler but LT,RT not supported on F310 so I had to utilize Start/Back . (which is fine but not optimal) Free/Look is very hard on controler so be prepared to use mouse for some puzzles and maybe enemies on low elevation . For the most part you do not need to aim at enemies as long as you shoot in general direction .Some people can't get Part2 of this game to work which is what PS1 copies were known to do . I can only speak for myself and the game works fine for me on win7x64  . According to some folks using this game on Win 10 is a pain in the butt ( although I am not sure why people expect a game this old to work with abomination that is Win10 ) If there is a compatibility mode try that .GameplayVery similar to Resident Evil 1 when it comes to controls and game format .Fixed Backgrounds,Tank controls,puzzles and reloading from inventory - classic .Some enemies are vulnarable to effects of Light so you can sometimes save bullets by using flashLight or turning on lights in room . Also some puzzles will utilize Light effects so keep that in mind .Some enemies respawn infinitely so if you stack and looking for a puzzle solution you will eventually get hit .Navigating in this game is also a pain in the butt . There are hundreds of god damn doors ,eveything is dark and camera angles sometimes make it worse . I played for hours with no ammo because i just missed a shotgun in the shade :)There are 2 playable characters which have some unique areas sorta like Resident Evil 2 had with Claire and Leon . One of the bosses even chases you around which reminds me RE3 Nemesis .You can save the game at any point if you have a medalion ( No save room? I know right )Atmosphere and Immersive SettingsAmong all horror games on PS1 The New Nightmare was the best looking horror game having superior visual effects,textures and 3D models. Sure it looks dated now but back then it was as good as it got .Probably the most important thing for a Horror game is great atmosphere which this game has in spades .In the dark surrounded by shadows you will meet few characters and they won't bring you comfort.Walking through dark corridors not knowing what is ahead , what you need to do or if you have enough ammo to fight what is coming .The New Nightmare is truly immersive game that makes you feel alone in the worst place you can imagine . The hellish soundtrack is just the cherry on cake .On a side note I love camera angles in this game that add to gloomy mood ( if you playing as detective watch out for camera angle from the window of the house it is ♥♥♥♥en cool )Score 7/10. If you like PS1 horror games with tank controls you will feel right at home . This game is somewhat cryptic and can be pretty obscure with puzzles. Most of enviroments are very dark so it is hard to find items and navigate with respawning enemies . Intense settings,fun gameplay and beautiful backgrounds overall make up for the minor problems . Good game but you may need a guide ."

You tought Resident Evil was scary? BUY THIS GAME! The atmosphere is perfect, gameplay is as you would expect from around 10 year old game. Story is above average, not bad, but you will quickly forget about it because of the tension the game creates. The only con about it in my opinion is that there is no controller support what so ever."

The games atmospher is very eerie and creepy. Iike that there are 2 different campaign options to fit your play style Edward Carabys campaign is more combat based in my oppinion well Alians is more based on puzzle solving. Whatever campaign you play they are both scary.Its a great game for a low price!

I've tried to patch it with a method I found on the internet that uses GOG's spanish version of the game, but if it's not enough it being in spanish (though the audio is in english, at least), when I press new game, it simply crashes (and by the way, only the option ""quit"" appears in the menu, the rest are invisible). Compatibility mode also don't change anything.So, as a game, that's one of my favorites, and it's an amazing game with a great storyline and atmosphere, the puzzles are great too, and the gameplay is wonderfully dynamic, the only bad thing about it is the monster's respawns, that really sucks. But as this port, stay away, except if you discover some working patch or if you want to try some method you found to see if it works, but you might need to refund as I did.I think this game works on Win7 and below, so give it a shot if that's your case."

But picking this up, oh dear.I'll be honest - I didn't get far. But I can't bring myself to continue.The voice acting is so monotonous you can't truely pick the girl to play after you heard her, and the controls - they're a joke. You use 's' to turn on the flashlight and arrows to move - and you're probably leaving your right hand on the mouse to shoot. Now how'r you going to do that?And the graphics - I know the game's old, but seriously, they could've made a better job. That being said though, they're better than the audio.And wtf man - you just crashed your plane, and you're walking slowly around like zombie?If you have to choose between flatout 3 or this, get this. But otherwise, save your money."

You can't even set any of the mouse buttons as the main ""Fire"" control!  After the first 5 enemies I had already gone through most of my ammo and all my med kits because of the terrible aiming/shooting mechanics.  Avoid this game unless you like having high blood pressure."

The launcher for does not work and says that the file is missing although it is right infront of me and clicking that file will run the game BUT won't let me play in a resolution above 480p. I play on a 1080p monitor and I have specs way above what is needed to run the game. I have tried many tutorials to sort the issues and none have. I am computer savvy and I am an A-Level student in Computing. So this is not me not having a clue on what I am doing.This is a real shame... I do not discourage people from playing this game based on my review as I have heard Windows 7 has it's own fix.It is also a shame that I can't play it because I loved the PS1 version even though it scared me. I have contacted Customer Support letting them know about the issue. Hopefully it will get fixed.

,Recommended,259190,28849093,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,~oФe~,"~ NOTE: Windows 10 breaks some visuals in the Steam ver. of the game. The community has found a fix for it and the game is now playable again after some fixes. If you don't want to bother with some fixing you can buy AitD 4 from GOG as well. ~I've owned 3 different versions of this game, the original PS1 title that I got some 14 years ago, the PS2 title I bought so I didn't need to change discs and this Steam version for nostalgia and the fact I don't have the physical copies anymore. This said, I think I have some mileage with this game.I still play this game through at least once a year on both characters and, in my opinion, it's one of the better horror games of the PS1 with good soundscape, visuals and gameplay, and it still holds up (or maybe that's just me).It's a game every horror enthusiast should play at least once, and I highly recommend it to anyone who either likes horror games or old games."
76561197984574042,Recommended,259190,30251957,Posted: 28 February,all,ƥƦơơƑ,"""Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare"" is a mild horror game wich is fun, has acceptable graphics (considering that it is from 2001) and a nice story.It has been quite entertaining to play through this title, especially because of its good level design and interesting characters. The graphics are still OK, even by today's standards. Basically, it uses the same mechanics as can be found in the original ""Resident Evil"", that is, you have pre-rendered backgrounds with animated 3D characters and items in the game world. If you want to play it on Windows 10 and want to have a higher resolution, just check the info on the Steam community. I think it will not work on newer OS if you do not fiddle a bit with it and use the fixes provided in the forum here. The setting is very atmospheric and eerie, and the rather nice-looking lighting effects add to this impression.In general, both the effects and music are good. Sometimes the disturbing music and some creature sounds are even really terrifying which is of course a good thing in a horror game.The controls are also good, except for some glitches when auto-aiming. I think the difficulty is medium. It would have been nice if there was an option to change it for those who would like to have more challenge.Characters and voiceover is also quite decent, only some of the male character's one liners and comments are a bit dull. Some might even like this as it makes the character more unique. You can also choose between the male and the female character. I have only played the man's storyline, but I think there are quite some differences when you choose the woman at the beginning.The only two real flaws to this game were occassional minor glitches with some enemies or other objects and that there are sometimes the notorious invisible walls or obstacles. So, when you run near the walls you hit an invisible boundary, even though your character is not actually touching any physical object.All in all, I would give this title a 75 % rating."
