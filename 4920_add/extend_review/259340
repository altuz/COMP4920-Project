As I shot the chickens as is instructed in the title I began to question all authority and the semblance of the person I really am.  Why was I illing these chickens?  Was it because the game ordered me to?  Does commiting a mass genocide against chickens to get a high score seem morally right?  These tough questions are a deciding factor in this game being a philisophical eureka.  10/10

,Not Recommended,259340,28890198,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,XJ9,"1st of all I have to say - the GAME itself is very good. It's great! Even better than Moorhuhn, because you will have various kinds of weapons, multiple different levels (while Moorhuhn has one level per game right) even secret levels and BOSS levels! The game is colorful and fun to play, so good times for kids and their parents.And now why you should not buy this game EVER on steam:-Save files doesn't work-You have to enter the game key once you open the game, and guess what? You will have to do it every single time you run the game because those saves are broken.-2003 resolutions - 800x600 is the biggest possible, and it looks stretched af, so only works okay with 4:3 monitors which are hard to find nowadays.-Mouse speed is crazy and you have no option to change it.-the game has the indescribable amount of bugs and NONE of mentioned above are going to be fixed because devs abandoned their game a long time ago.Even with the 90% discount this game will be overpriced (not because the game is bad but the steam version) because there even-no steam cards-no steam achievements-no fun allowedDo not buy. Stay away.Join my curator grouphttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/garbage_games_challenge#curation"

,Recommended,259340,18432370,"Posted: 11 October, 2015",all,Fishbun,"9 years ago, I was trapped in an abandoned factory for 3 weeks straight. There was very little light and almost no food or water. I discovered two things that helped me power through this time in my life. A cheap desktop from 2004, and a copy of Chicken Shoot Gold on CD-ROM. Using the manual powered generator I found in the basement of the factory, I did nothing but play Chicken Shoot Gold until I was rescued by the missing persons detectives. Playing it now brings a warm sentiment to my heart that I cannot obtain anywhere else. I think of the struggles I have faced and how I know I can power through them, no matter how hopeless it seems. It all comes back to me with this game. I would rate it 10/10."

,Recommended,259340,18819194,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,Foxysen,"Chicken Shoot Gold consist of two games, Chicken Shoot and Chicken Shoot 2. They are similar to each other, could say that CS2 is more of mission pack. Anyway, they came out around in 2003, developed by some Toontraxx and published by TopWare. They come from the era of shareware games, mind it, and seem to ride on Moorhuhn/CrazyChicken success, both being shooting gallery where you just shoot at many chickens.Actually, as I found out from a friend, original name of this polish series was ""Kurka Wodna"". And what you see as Chicken Shoot Gold is combination of the second and the third game. The first game isn't all that known, but you can YouTube gameplay out. It's quite primitive.It also for whatever reason was ported to GBA, DS and Wii (in 2007!). Which is way past the intented audience of bored office workers. Reviewers weren't afraid to dumb the game on those platforms. PC version seems to be the best anyway.Technically it's as-is. For 2003 game. Which means low-resolution in forced full-screen which will go ""we smoke everyday"" if you alt-tab. No Steam Overlay. Nope, no widescreen. You can only increase resolution up to 800x600, but it will just increase in-game space. Meaning that you will see more. Which affects gameplay, making it harder, as eggs thrown at you will hit you only if they will be on screen.Also, it doesn't usually remember CD-Key and scores, so check Steam guides to find out how to fix that.Also, nope, Internet multiplayer doesn't work. It can't ""connect to host"". Local seem to function up to server browser, but you know, I don't have friend nearby with computer with local net to connect by to check this out. Not 2000 anymore.And so it begins, you got two games, with 5 usual levels in the first CS and 6 exotic levels in the second. Then you choose one of the two modes to play. Classic is score based, you worry less about being hit by egg and more about not accidently hitting other non-chicken living beings. With weird exclusions to both rules. Like owl-looking ones, who are too gross, I guess. Just try to get enough score in time to go to the next level. And arcade mode, where you got usual lifebar and have to avoid eggs by either shooting them down or scrolling away.After which you are shown intro where a farmer of sorts will wake up and starts shooting chickens who were eating spilled seeds of sorts, instead of trying to lock them back. After which chickens will suddenly learn how to fly away. And then you will murder all the chickens by getting even more disturbed, whether young or old. Which gets a bit wicked when you find out that some don't just fall over, but turn into angels.And well, really, it is what it is. Shareware-age moorhuhn-clone ""me too"". Albeit it has more content that Moohruhn in levels. And you can get more weapons to use and such. Final boss. This stuff isn't easy. Both games also have secret levels that I couldn't find how to get to.But really, it ain't Virtua Cop. Or House of the Dead on Steam. It doesn't have much going on outside of shooting gallery. Just some chickens, some throw eggs, and interactive level objects you can shoot mostly for score. In all honesty, I wasn't sure whether to recommend it or not. It didn't♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, so I guess it's good if you know what you are getting.Nowdays no one is going to play them past hour anyway. And owch my fingers on right hand."
,Recommended,259340,12309142,"Posted: 30 September, 2014",all,golly,"First off let me say I came into this game with low expectations, but after ten minutes I was hooked.the story is on par with greats such as Call of Duty Global Offensive, Raider of the Lost Shark, and Glover.The story revolves around a farmer who I could not discern if he was pig or man, but that's the beauty of the game YOU the gamer get to choose.The shooting mechanics are some of the most fine-tuned and realist seen within the last 12 years.The evironments are 100.1% interactive, gone are the days of battlefields ""levelutions"" which were drab and bland.The only negative I can see in this game is that I felt physically assaulted when an egg flew at me and a chicken gave me the double bird, but seeing as how I did have these feelings they left a huge impact on me and left me pondering my life days after, so you could take that as a negative or positve depending on what you decide to call art.overall this is a great buy for anyone looking for an emotional rollercoster, and deep reflecttion. 9.9999/10 ( I would give it a ten but nobodies perfect. rip Hannah Montana.)"
,Recommended,259340,11585956,"Posted: 7 August, 2014",all,talgaby,"Short version: 73%Chicken Shoot Gold/2 won’t revolutionise the light gun shoot ‘em up genre and they probably won’t entertain you for more than 20 minutes, but they are perfect to just whip up a simple little game to pass the time when you feel a bit tired or lazy.They are also exceptionally great to keep little kids occupied.Trust me, it has been proven numerous types, your little brother/sister or your young child can sit in front of it for hours on end while you will be free to do anything. Especially if you show them there are more levels so they can play with a goal to progress.Long version:Chicken Shoot Gold and Chicken Shoot 2 are actually cash-in games that rode the success of Moorhuhn (Crazy Chicken), a franchise that lasted 10 years and 30 games. Apparently Germans really like to shoot chickens around the turn of the millennium; during that time you could find dozens of these themed (usually cartoonish) shoot ‘em ups on the internet and on gaming magazine CDs.Chicken Shoot’s primary selling point is the hand-drawn graphics, and I have to admit, they look good even in 2014 on a full HD monitor. While the game itself is simple as a stick (you get a gun, you shoot chicken, you reload, then shoot more chicken), the small details can really add a few layers to it here and there.For example all levels (there are five of them in the first one, six in the second, plus an end boss screen in both) feature hidden bonuses you can shoot for additional points: shooting a mine cart into an abandoned mine, blowing off the top hat of a snowman and so on; this also emulates Moorhuhn’s crazy level secrets. And these are just a few of the Easter eggs you can find in the game– apart from those the chicken throw in your face of course.Yes: the games have several levels. Most people who try the games out will never notice that, because you either need to kill all chicken (Arcade) or get to 2500/3500 points/level (Classic) to advance to the next stage.And yes, there is actually an end boss in both games, and in the second one beating the Chicken King can be a really difficult task. So… good luck if you try it."

,Not Recommended,259340,29885343,Posted: 12 February,all,Raymond,"Chicken Shoot Gold Review - Raymond KTIt does not take a genius to know what this game is about. Shoot all the chickens to score points. You can also shoot objects (dynamite, bombs..) and other animals (birds, whales , sharks) some give you more points than others but you can also get score reductions for shooting the wrong animals (although I did not figure out how this works because you get points reducted for killing crows but not for whales....). You can also pick up several powerups and different weapons to help you in your mission.The game pretty much looks and feels like a free browser game. You use your mouse to aim/reload and graphically the game looks OK (for a 2003 game).Not worth the price"
,Not Recommended,259340,32793110,Posted: 25 June,all,Stay_C,"Dear readerYou may seem confused about this long review. So if you don't have much time to read all the words I have preaperd to give my emotional, but still proffesional, opinion you can just read short version review and then scroll to final verdict at the bottom of this masterpiece.Short review:  WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥Okay Ladies and Gantleman who decided to read the entire collection of my reamarks. I would like to tell you story of this game at the begining, so you couyld understand reality of preapering this interesting title.Chicken Shoot Gold was released at first november, 2003 by TOPWARE  INTERACTIVEAnd here is the first sight that this game may not be top one. Well, I wonder how many of you, my dear reader, have ever heard before about this developer? I mean, well you can be unknown but still good and then become famous, but it's been 14 years already and the game haven't turned out to be succesfull.Game programmers from Toon TRAXX Studios probably forgot about one X in their name. And If you haven't heard about them too, no worries. Because this game is classified as Indie. Well imagine situation when in 2003 professional game makers do games likePrince of Persia: Sands of time; Neighbours of hell; Pro Evolution Soccer IIIToon TRAX XXX XXX Studios decide to release their own (indie xd) game it just can't succed.I would be surprised if in a such a good year for games someone would give a look at game based on shooting down chickens. But it doesn't mean this game is bad. Anyway It's.Let me justify why I find this game not worth it's money.It's ♥♥♥♥ed up.Thank you.Well I'm just joking.This game have problem when chickens get stucked behing the trees and you just cant hit them, or when chickens are behind invisible wall and your bullets can't reach'em.Game also struggle when we are about showing HP, Well you know when you are low on HP and when you are HIGH on HP, but their is no score and no real possibility to check this out.Music and SFX are weak, bad, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ just because I don't like them. You can't feel the character whom I called Hans (Maybe because game comes from german, or maybe he looks like soldier from first Wolfenstein, or maybe because their is Polish Flag on the battlefield) A blood wanting justice warrior who decided to slaughter, slay and murder all chickens (although this hiding deeply in the woods and on sahara desert, askin alines for help) just because he fell asleep and meanwhile chickens decidedd to eat his corn.Well Hans is retard, there is no daubt about this.Before we get into talkie, talkie about few pluses  I'd like to inform you that I'm impressed you are still reading.Congratulations.Game is consisted of 3 modes.Arcade: shoot as many chickens as possible, get as many points as possible and don't dieClassic: This is♥♥♥♥♥♥ dont play itMultiplayer: I really wanted to check this out but humans seem to have IQ possitive and do not waste tme on this game, so maybe another time.In all modes (I lie, I don;t know if it is true about multiplayer, but I wish you good luck in checking this out) yoiur hand must be faster then horny teenage from junior high. Your reflex must be better then Iker Casillas during his highlights. And also your patience must be hard, strong w/e.And now for seroius. This game is really challenging and addicting. You want just one more try, and after 667th you decide to write and review.That's the reason.Also this game is not cheap, and for sure it's not worth 7 euro, But mostly it's not worth time. So if you want to waste your time go buy drugs and have fun.No, drugs are bad. Go Sleep.Anyway This game is bad, and not worth playing.I don;t know if this review makes any sense, anyway I hope you had some fun while reading it.Have funDon't put hand in pony's jaw.Thanks for your time."

,Not Recommended,259340,9835645,"Posted: 16 April, 2014",all,Snort Cannon,Chicken Shoot is an Arcade shooter that promises us a beutifully drawn enviroment and fun gameplay but will it deliver ? In this game you play as a farmer whos farm gets invaded by chickens so you have to destroy all of them. So hows the game ? Its one of the worst games on steam period. Lets go over the reasons. The game is marketed as a an arcade shooter so that means it depends alot on the score you get. While the scoring system doesnt work at all its just one of the problems that the game is riddled with. The game has an abysmal hit detection that doesnt work at all. You hit the eniemies when you dont want to do that. The game has two settings Arcade and Classic. Arcade is just you trying to rack up a high score while in the classic mode you have lives. The game does have a beutifully drawn eviroment and some smile worthy animations but apart from that its not nothing special. Besides the first chicken shoot game you also get the sequel which is a review for another day. Overall this game is a very stale and a boring shooter with broken shooting mechanics and horrible hit detection. If you are curious about the game wait for a discount since getting it for full price is a rip off. I give Chicken Shoot a 3/10

Takes some serious dedication. Copy paste wont work as there are separate boxes for each portion of the key. Tabbing out to accomplish this corrupts the art assets making them pink and cyan CGA style and completely screwing up with their location. The game itself is probably the best in the series, has a lot of levels, some hidden easter eggs everywhere and the chickens actively taunt you and try to make themselves as much a nuisance as possible, making you all the more psyched to gun them down. I like the game but due to the issues it has, and the fact that the gameplay itself is not exactly stellar. I would recommend you just make a few sacrifices and play the 2015 remake Crazy Chickens Moorhun: Invasion or better yet avoid this franchise altogether and try something like Starfence: Heroid Edition which has additional mechanics in the form of tower defense elements while keeping the twitch shooter mechanics mostly intact."
