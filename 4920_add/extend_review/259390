They were just really wonky no matter what settings I used. The gamepad joystick was too sensitive for the shooting parts, but not sensitive enough on the menus. And the mouse controls were horrible for the platforming bits.The platforming bits seemed unnecessary. Why not just give us a menu-based level hub instead of constantly shifting between two types of gameplay?The shoot em parts were quite fun, but felt like they could have been done a lot better. The worst part was how often enemies would go off screen. If enemies go off screen in a shooter, they’re not supposed to come back!! But in this game, they do, quite often. Most of the enemy movement patterns depended on your movement, so you often had to move in a way that would keep them on screen. That’s pretty annoying.Anyway, I played the game for the artstyle, and it surely delivered on unique graphics. The melee weapons on your ship were fun too. But overall I wasn’t too impressed."
,Recommended,259390,8407859,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,Seabeast,"Ballpoint Universe is truly an astonishing game with a unique artstyle since everything in the game is drawn with a ballpoint pen! The graphics are so detailed and you can really see how much love and passion has gone into making the game. For this to be a game made by only three people, it's amazing.Now that I've gotten that covered let's talk a little bit about the key features and gameplay. The story isn't too linear and you can choose if you want to do a mission or not which is good because it means that you are not going to be stuck on a part just because you are unable to beat it. You can in a sense explore the hand drawn world freely just to admire the artstyle and graphics. The controls are pretty good although the mouse might sometimes bug out a bit but it doesn't seem to be such a huge deal. The game is a shoot-em-up adventure indie game and even though I don't consider myself a big shoot-em-up fan this is really quite enjoyable. The whole shoot-em-up aspect of the game is relatively well excecuted and it is fun blowing  evil doodles out of the sky.There is a fair amount of customization/personalization of your spaceship and there seems to be a lot of different weapons and accessories. The currency ingame is ink which makes sense since that is what everyone and everything in the game is made of. The ink that you collect through missions can be used for things like weapons for your ship and spinning the wheel of fortune for more ink.As for the story there is some but for the hardcore story fans it might be too little of it but this isn't the kind of game that would need a really heavy story. If I was to try and explain the story I would probably say that it is basically about a doodle who is helping his fellow doodles in the fight against the evil doodles which in the game are called Logicians.The game also features some great relaxing music and even though the tracks are pretty repetetive you don't want to turn it off.It costs barely anything and you could easily get several hours out of it. Even though I haven't dived into it too deeply yet I can see myself playing it for more than a few hours when I get the chance. Even if you aren't quite sure if you want to buy it or not you should really consider it since it really is an experience to say the least. Innovative games like this one is what makes me love indie titles as much as I do.I won't deny that the game has a few flaws but I believe that even the harshest critic could have a really good time if you try to see what the game does well instead of what it does badly.An overall great game and for the little money that you spend on it, you get enough out of it that it kind of is a must buy for almost everyone.- Liam"

76561198027929653,Recommended,259390,10965263,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,RawrRiceball,"After playing this game, I feel like drawing something. This game plays like a shmup( Shoot them up) if you're not familiar with games where you're a spaceship to destrory enemy planes or aliens. But what's unique about the game is everything is done in Ballpoint; you're always introduced to new and vibrant art that keeps coming in your face. When I first played this game, I was confused either to say if it was a platformer and a shmup. I feel like the platforming sections are really weak and presents a flaw when you're trying to go to many platforms. Controls don't feel tight so you have to rely on your mouse or keyboard/game pad for the jumping sections. The game works as you collect inkblots to upgrade, buy new parts to your ship which adds a lot of customization to how you want to approach things. You want a sword and gun combo? Done. You want to protect yourself and use missiles? Done. You just want to go commando and use dual melee or guns? Sure thing. Its very rewarding when you upgrade because it helps with ranking on missions. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try it out, the game can keep you playing for hours and it's not entirely hard ( The wheel can give you 40k inkblots if you're having trouble) if you're new."

But between the cheap price-tag and the interesting screenshots, I figured what the hey.  And whad'ya know?  It ain't so bad!!  Aesthetically gorgeous, exceptionally imaginative and quite, quite playable.I'm not entirely convinced the slavishly old-school shooter elements were the best way to implement the extraordinary visual approach...but having said that, everyone and his alsation is doing quirky, cutesey, post-post-modernistic platformers these days, so you have to give the designers full points for trying something a little bit removed from the here and now.Is this gonna be my game of the year?  Hell no.  Is this even gonna be a game I'll play all the way through to the end?  Possibly not, especially given how irrevocably crap I am at these arcade-y shooter games.  But I would heartily recommend it to anyone who actually likes a good, mindless blam-fest (with strategically varied but incredibly llloooooonnng boss fights) and/or games seeking to push the visual envelope.

,Recommended,259390,8735751,"Posted: 16 January, 2014",all,MashPotato,"I'll admit it--I bought this game purely for the looks, but once I actually started playing it, I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. The game is a shooter, with some platforming/exploring bits in between areas.Ballpoint Universe would be a bit on the easy side for shooter fans, but as a shooter-unsavvy gamer, the difficulty was about right for me.  The levels are fairly short, which makes dying and having to restart a level non-frustrating.  Overall, even with a few deaths per level, I made steady progress and never felt a level was unfair.You can upgrade and customize your ship using Ink that you collect from destroyed enemies. The different weapons feel varied, and for some levels it makes sense to perhaps not use your usual kit, and change it up (eg. I found it useful on occasion to equip two melee weapons instead of melee + gun. I never bothered with shields, but that's another option if you like playing in that style).  The grind was minimal in terms of getting good enough equipment to finish the game, but if you want to upgrade EVERYTHING, you'll be in the game quite a while.In addition to the story mode, there's an Infinite mode where you can see how long you can last. Also, once you pass a level in Story mode you can revisit that level any time from the Start screen and try to do better. There's enough there to keep you busy.On the other hand, I found the platforming fairly frustrating due to the weird controls and collision-detection. Luckily here's no consequence for dying by falling off edges, otherwise I might have given up early on. I found using the mouse nigh-impossible for the platform parts, and ended up using an XBox 360 controller (which I recommend for both the platformer and shooter parts).As mentioned before, the game is beautiful (and prompted me to whip out the F12 button for the first time on Steam ;) ). As an illustrator/game dev myself, my kudos to the artist for creating such a lovely-looking gameworld. The music is also very good and fits the game perfectly.If you're looking for a casual shooter you can dip into to have a short game once in a while, you can't go wrong with $4 for Ballpoint Universe."

,Recommended,259390,8083362,"Posted: 17 December, 2013",all,Kid-IcK,Ballpoint Universe has a lot of potential but the game is buggy. The game is beautiful and has a lot of potential for a platformer but my only complaint is the bugs.  Example: Just did the first ship mission. I blew up all the guns on the thing at the end but nothing happened afterwards. Just kept flying for over 4 minutes with nothing happening. Maybe there is something that I need to do but then I clicked on UNLOCK CAMPAIGN in the menu...a LOADING prompt came up and stayed there for over 4 minutes rendering me unable to select anything in the main menu.
,Recommended,259390,8529625,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,OniBarubary,"This game looks so neat. It's artwork isn't ""beautiful"" but still charming and occasionally complicatedly pretty. It's all sketchy and papery. Real cool. A lot of stylized designs like Monty Python animation or different cartoony styles.Ahem, anyways. This is a SHMUP. But it's really interesting. You run around in a 2D platforming area, occasionally finding collectables, but mostly just talking to people and accepting missions. Once you accept a mission, you launch up to a brief (or long) SHMUP section, collecting ink, that ends in a boss and are graded and rewarded based on how many lives you have at the end of it (1 is Bronze, 3 is Silver, 5 is Gold). There is also an ""Endless Space"" area you can go to at any time as long as you have the units of payment for it and it's pretty much a place to collect ink for upgrades. You start where you left off or died last time in neverending waves of enemies.The upgrades and combat is where it actually is a bit different than standard SHMUP fare. You have a top and a bottom weapon, a nose which determines your overload ability which you get by killing enemies without being hit for an extended period, and a body which determines health and passives your ship has. What's cool is that a lot of the weapons aren't standard fare. There are three main types; projectiles, melee and shields.Projectiles are your bullet weapons and are actually quite varied. There's one that fires in diagonals, one that fires a buckshot cluster that spreads as it gets further away, one that fires a slow shot that pierces and so on. They really vary it up a lot.Melee is where the game gets really interesting. Melee attacks mean you have to get your ship close to the enemies. They are generally much stronger than projectiles, but as a result are more risky to use. There are enemies that can only be damaged by melee so it pays to have one equipped. Likewise, there are lots of types. Swords that slash near it in an arc, a spear that shoots in front with greater range and hits enemies on coming back but doesn't hit above or below you, a blade that simply circles your ship, a chainsaw and so on. They are really cool and fun to use.Last is shields, which are fairly simple; they block attacks. They are likewise varied in how they are used, some reflecting shots but having less strength, some a wider area, some spiky so they do damage if you hit with them. They can be real life savers on certain bullety bosses.There are a couple annoyances in the platforming part with how...odd your character moves and sometimes the screen can get so cluttered it's hard to see shots coming for you (and your hitbox is...indeterminate most of the time) but honestly any bad parts to this game are easily washed away by how fun it is to get right into the swing of things and how quick the levels play out. Getting a perfect on each level sure is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in a fun way.And that's pretty much it. You're a little squiggly doodle who comes out of the Idea Spring and is immediately conscripted into the war against the Logiticians or whatever they're called which are trying to oppress you with their straight lines and harsh angles. You just gotta be free and squiggly!The game is cheap and mad fun. It's on Steam too with a bajillion cards and achievements."
,Recommended,259390,8659096,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,1G86,"What I really like about the game is its art style. As the game describes, the world is entirely drawn with ballpoint. The environments are done with great detail and patterns, and the background colors are just a level of high on its own. The sprites can become repetitive but that point can be ignored altogether.Game is pretty straight forward, if you guys are fans of R-Type shooters, this one is neat-o. (With short Mario platforming breaks in the middle of shoot 'em up waves) Ship customization, while not so deep, is interesting enough to work on. Controls can be a bit of an issue but the game does support several options - you can switch between Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepad on the fly.Soundtrack compliments the art style sufficiently - it's sci-fi but fits the doodle world with mixes of heavy overlays to chirpy switch ups.There is low involvement when it comes to a story but we are taking a break from all the deep plots at the moment. You basically are a doodle in a doodle world, with doodle ships in a doodle war.My only real gripe about it is the achievement system not unlocking properly at the moment. Whether it's my own internet connection that's the problem or something on the game's end, I can't really say right now.Overall I do recommend getting this game, as a leisurely break from all the complicated titles out there. The visuals are a dreamy landscape to say the least, and the simple shoot 'em up gets very tripped out."

It looks so nice, that you want to continue to see the next level, and the lever after that again and so on. Hand drawn levels can be nice, it can be fantastic, awful, and just plain boring. This game nailed it. It looks fantastic, and that makes you forget about the sub-par controls. Mouse control is too sloppy for the adventure, but spot on for fighting, while keyboard is spot on for adventure and too sensitive for fighting.The shooter-part of the game feels a bit boring in the first 2-3 waves, but then it really get's better, and it's worth to buy the game just for that.I however wish there was better sound options here, one slider for music and one for effects would be nice, both from a gaming perspective, and not at least for youtube (Content ID things).

Some levels can be hard to find and I found myself completly skipping one or two of them.  The story mode doesn't provide to great a challenge, but I still enjoyed replaying levels until I acheived gold.The game's Infinite Mode is where all the replay value lies.  It provides a decent challenge. The difficulty ramps up each wave to the point of ridiculousness.Overall its an Ok game.  I'd give a 6/10.  It losses points for the platforming segments.

So the question is, is the game good? Yes and no. If you want some amazing art and creative design that makes you feel like you are on a trip, then yea, this game is good. If you want a functioning game that you don’t particularly feel like you have to hold your breath every time you finish a level...well...then no. I would still recommend it though, just for the art alone."

The price is very agreeable and the artwork is breathtaking and the sound FX along with the score cause for great immersion. The story is complex and will absorb you with little to no trouble despite how concise it is. The short story is offset by the infinite forest mode. Another good quaility of the game is the combat system is interesting and unique with a lot of customizability to your weapons. The fun gameplay, well crafted story, and low price make this game a wise purchase for indie game enthusiasts."

From the odd mix of 80% shootemup and 20% adventure platforming, the beermat doodles brought to live in a beermat doodle world, the awkward controls that you need to get used to and the odd but cutely presented story and characters that come with it.I didn't like it first time around, but at a second glance I suddenly got into it and I really enjoyed the game as a whole. It's not too hard or easy, the weapon and ship upgrades are numerous and feel pretty unique (by design anyway). It's fun to see the uses for each item -even the crappy ones- and just start collecting everything while finishing the rather short storyline. Plenty of replayability if you want to get each and every achievement, as long as you don't mind some repetitiveness. I think the story mode could have done with one or two more worlds though, but it's enough for its price (and budget, I presume).So yeah, it's worth the 4 euros that it's currently at, but you can also wait for a discount if you're in doubt. I like quirk."

,Not Recommended,259390,8151518,"Posted: 20 December, 2013",all,GC Positive,"Made by Arachnid Games, Ballpoint Universe is a mix between platformer and shoot-em up set in a world hand drawn in entirely, you guessed it, ballpoint pen that is inhabited by Doodles, and their rigid counterparts Logicians. You, a small little Doodle, must get in your ship and stop the Logicians from converting everything into logical rigid, and more efficient forms like squares, triangles, weird skeleton heads and...half faces that shoot teeth at you...Yeah! From start to finish the art is decidely...okay. NPCs models are often reused almost to a repetitive degree, and don't really stand out. The doodles for the most part can be categorized as one of these: Bald hitchhiker, zombie tv, boot soldier, or potted plant that has lost its pot. Backgrounds and environments are hit or miss. Sometimes they're interesting and warrant exploration, but that feeling quickly wanes as you'll be going back to some of these places as the story progresses. The art during the shoot em up sections tends to follow this trend with the added nuisance of having scenery in the foreground that blocks your view of the action. The platforming is basic stuff the whole game through. Jump up stairs, jump on moving platforms. That's basically it. The controls aren't very good; Doodle slips and slides across the ground, and you will quickly discover that the real challenge during these sections is mastering the floaty gameplay. Seriously, you have no traction. If you're on a slope, poor Doodle tumbles and fumbles to his death assuming nothing catches him mid-roll. Upon landing, he'll slide a little bit more past your landing point and often times roll right off the platform, and in multiple cases jumps so fast that he ricochets off the wall of a ledge and falls (and then subsequently) rolls off the same place you jumped from. No matter how tall the ledge in question is. In one instance, I had to purposefully miss a jump, allow Doodle to roll himself into a corner, and then jump only to land on my mark and roll off of it until I realized that since I was in a corner and would ricochet off the ledge next to me the air-time would be enough to send Doodle past half of the jumping puzzle. While the platforming bits are probably the most difficult parts of the game, they do not take up most of the time you'll playing it. Each platforming section is broken up by missions given to you by certain npcs you encounter as you progress. During each mission, you blast and slash your way through enemies, fight a boss, and then collect medals based on how well you performed. Killing an enemy unit during missions drop Ink that you can collect to upgrade your ship. Considering this is a world consisting of Ink, I like to think the your ship grows stronger and runs on the blood of your enemies. The shoot em up gameplay is admittedly solid. Your ship is made of four parts: Two weapon slots, a nose, and the wings. Each part can be changed and upgraded extensively, and each part also provides different upgrades to the ship as a whole. Guns have different firing patterns, the nose of your ship determines what kind of special blast it has equipped, wings provide support bonuses and health, and melee weapons have varying ranges for attacking. There is room for creativity. You can mix and match parts any way you want, so it's very possible to have a ship that looks very different from the one you start with. However despite this the shoot em up segments suffer from a few hiccups. The first most predominately being boss designs. With one or two exceptions...they suck. With such a small selection of missions to play, it's a little anti-climactic to be fighting the same boss I already defeated two missions ago. Especially if this time around it's the same boss fight. There's even one case where the missions are back to back and the boss is exactly the same. The second issue is the pacing of these levels. The missions feel slow and drag on, with enemies lethargically drifting around the screen, and half the time don't even shoot in your general direction. I should take the chance to note that the music, while being the game's strongest aspect, drives home the relaxed pace of these levels. Maybe it's just me, but when I hear this:https://soundcloud.com/docprop/doc-prop-saddle?in=docprop/sets/ballpoint-universe-originalat the ship select screen, I get excited, and then I get treated to this after hitting the GO button:https://soundcloud.com/docprop/doc-prop-mad-ploppage-the?in=docprop/sets/ballpoint-universe-originalAnd I feel like I've just been told to stop getting excited about blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. My personal peeve with the game is the way it punishes melee weapons. Don't get me wrong: An enemy moving around the screen to avoid me? That's fine. Enemies that form lines and fire barrages to prevent me from getting close? Fine. Enemies that kamikaze to kill me? That's all okay, but an enemy mirroring my movements and going off screen to where I can't hit them? Not good. It makes a slow shoot em up segment even slower, forcing me to hug the left side of the screen until they slowly saunter back into view so I can hit them once before they fly out of view again. That's boring, and especially annoying when a level boss does it.Ultimately, it's not a great game, it's not even a good game. It's decent, and no amount of ballpoint pen drawings or ship customization can change the fact that it falls flat in both of its genres. Add to all that the very short campaign of about two to four hours, and it's safe to assume that while Ballpoint Universe looks good on paper it certainly doesn't make the cut. Feel free to skip it, and use your money toward something else. Buy steam cards or something I don't know."
