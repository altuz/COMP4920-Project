I honestly thoroughly enjoyed the game play. The learning curve is not steep at all, and once you master the mechanics, you'll breeze through the content. I can imagine racing your friends for the best completion time would extend the life of the game in a fun and social way as well!Bottom line, give this company a chance, and I can see them producing high-quality content in the future."

At first it seems a bit flat on the gameplay-side, but it keeps adding some features so it wont get boring of the whole play time. It is controled entirely with the mouse, so its perfect for a session while eating a snack, watching tv/twitch or anything else. For this low price I´ll totally recommend this little gem.ProNot to complicated, but it will add some features over time - like Items,diffrent enemies with diffrent patterns - and a barrelA perfect timefiller in short burstsAppealing light-hearted cartoon-styleContraA bit too easySometimes the mouse-input seems not the best choiceFlat story - You are a thief, your loot gets stolen - get it backVerdictAfter my playtime of round about 4h I completed the game to 100%, but for the low price you get a beatiful, light-hearted stealth-game . Highly recomended for stealthfans, even its not the hardest game out there in this genre. Hopefully the developer makes a sequel."

The only place to hide is in piles of hay or grass and only barrels, trees, rocks and jars are breakable- Easy to screw up - I suppose if you are the patient sort this one might not be an issue but I found that quite often when I go to move my character he somehow ends up in the enemies line of sight despite my delibarite effort to keep him hidden- Almost no story at all - plus (in my opinion) the ending is really bad- Prices for upgrades in the store are far too expensive based on how much gold you gain per level and how few levels there are - and the upgrades aren't that helpful anyways- Lack of variety in general - only 3 different area types that you explore through and the several levels for each area type all feel about the same- Far too easy - Most Enemies can be easily taken out with an arrow from afar before they can react and then you can restock on arrows basically anytime you want my destroying trees or barrels - not to mention anytime you die you can hit a retry button that lets you start over from the enterance of the room you died in with no demerit- Unneccesary score system - I suppose since the exp is linked to the score system it's kind of important but they didnt need to put one in - or at the very least - I felt no pressure to get a high score because whether you do or not you are going to get a good chunck of experience points that will almost always level you up- Repetitive music that is the same for every level you play throughVerdict: In the end I didn't hate the 2 hours I spent playing this game but unless it is on a really good sale and you don't have any other games to play than I wouldn't recommend getting this game."

The game isn't overly difficult, once you learn how things work you should easily get the top ranking on most stages on your first attempt. The RPG elements aren't overly deep and by the end you'll have lvled up everything. Lastly on the negatives the game is very short. I completed the game, gathered the collectables, and went back to get a gold ranking on every stage and came in at 3.3h of gameplay. So its a pretty brief experience. Aside from the negatives though i had a great time playing through the game and now that the developers have lowered the cost to $5 I'd say its certainly worth picking up for a fun night of sneaky sneaky action.

In the game, you have to get back a sack of gems that is taken away from you on the start, There are 17 Stages, and Three ""Scenarios"", Respectively, The Woods, The Canyon (Desert) and The City, each one presents different enemies and different mechanics.The main character (Your character) has 4 Different ""Skills"":- Health : Ammount of hearts (Most enemies deal 1 Heart of damage, Some deal 0.5, some deal 1.5 and some deal more.)- Melee Damage : Damage with the sword (You have to be on the tile next to the enemy to meele him)- Ranged Damage : Bow (You have to manually aim)- Walking Distance : Ammount of tiles you can walk using one (Of three) ""Charges"" while in ""Combat Mode"".Each time you level up you can add one point to each of them (12 levels total), Health has 5 Possible upgrades, Melee has 2, Ranged has 2 and Walking has 2.There is a shop where you can buy, Health potions, Ham (bait), Mana potion (Fills your ""Charges"" while in combat mode), Hammer (lets you break rocks), Sleepy potion (You add them to arrows and you can make your enemies sleep instead of killing/harming them) and The barrel (You ""wear"" a barrel and you are completely sneaky for one stage.)Cons of the game :- Short - 17 Stages, While they are all ""Easy"" if you dont care about maxing out the points.- The game doesnt force you to use all mechanics. - I personally only used The bow, sword, health potion and ham. If you are very good (And full of patience) you can finish all stages flawlessly with only a bow and sword.Pros:- Its fun to try and beat all stages 100%. - + Achievments- The gameplay can get intense if youre almost getting caugh.- Lots of different paths to get to the ending.- Lots of different enemies and mechanics- The art is fun, which makes you be able to play the game for an indefinite ammount of time without tiring of it.- Some posters have some fun jokes - ""The right to brag."" , ""20 Mins of backrub"", etc- Variety of enemies- Price- I only stumbled across 1 bugConclusion:I recommend the game to people who like to 100% everything, as it is fun and due to the art style, you can play it for a long time. It is cheap and provides you with at least 3 Hours of fun! I'd say that even peolpe who dont like puzzle games should buy it, to be honest.Sound/Music : 9/10 - Funky and matches the game. Creates a mood.Art : 10/10 - The art style matches the game perfectly, Everything is colorful so it doesnt tire your eyes.Enjoyability : 8.5 / 10 - If there were more stages, this game would be flawless.Overall : 9/10Suggestions:- Add scoreboards so we can compare our scores for each stage to other people! Would incentivate lots of people to buy due to the competitivity!- Add Bonus points due to time (The less time, the more extra points)- Release more stages!- Add map editors, so we can create our own stages and share with people on an in-game hub!Props to the devs. Very fun game!"

,Recommended,259410,21092751,"Posted: 9 February, 2016",all,CaseyMae3,"This game was fun, but very short. Only 17 levels... actually 15 since ""The End"" can't honestly count as a level and the first one is technically a tutorial.There are plenty of ways the levels can be completed and played, which explains the abundance of achievements for this small game. But for someone who isn't necessarily interested in getting achievements and would rather just play the game (like myself), I was able to complete the game fairly quickly and without having to use too many of the items in-game.That doesn't necessarily mean that the game was easy, however. It definitely has its challenges when it comes to fighting certain enemies, figuring out how to open different gates, and finding ways to sneak around safely. But, what takes all of that difficulty away is the fact that if/when you do die, the game just restarts you in that same room. I personally think it would be more challenging if you were put back at the beginning of the level to start all over again when you die. It would make you take your character's health more seriously.Also, not sure if this was a problem that only I was experiencing, but anytime I exited the game it would just freeze right there at the main menu. I could not alt+tab back to my desktop and the game wouldn't do what it normally should do (just close and return me to whatever window I was on previously). I had to open task manager just to get back to my desktop. It was just a minor annoyance.I recommend this game because despite the couple of cons it has, it was still an enjoyable short game, but I also think you should only buy it when it's on sale."

If it wasn't on sale (2$), I would have never bought it,...But seriously...I have finished the game and completed almost every achivement. It took me aproximatly only 3.5 hours. And that's one of the cons. The game is really short. It isn't really hard of a puzzle game, but it will take you some retries to complete some levels and if you are going for the ""gold star"" on everything it will take even more retries, but that is the meaning.Gameplay:The game is very simple. You move your character around/hide and try to avoid getting ""Detected"". You will need to kill the enemies before they kill you or if you think everything out and ""time"" perfectly you will kill everyone without getting damaged. It is possible to avoid every enemy and complete the level (but that is very boring!). After completing a level you will get a certain amount of exp (determines on how good you completed the level). You use the exp to level up you character. There are not many possibilities to level up your character, only 4 things you can level up and it is kind off boring. But since the game is short it is okay, you wont need many charcter upgrades.Levels are not so long. It will take you aproximatly 5-8 min to complete a level (it depends on how far you are in the game). One level is build up of many (5-12) ""scenes"" and the design of the scenes in 1 level are the same. Levels vary a little from each other, but it's only when you enter a new region that they change design the most. There are 3 regions, Impwood (6 levels), Cursed Canyon (5 levels) and Summer Canyon (5 levels). Impwood got the forest design, with a lot of trees and bushes, Cursed Canyon got sand and skeletons, while Summer Canyon is in a kingdom/city.Game design:It is simple, just as the game. It is not as pretty as games like ""Bastion"" or ""Braid"". But since the game was so cheap, the design is ""okay"".Conclusion:Simple game, not a hard puzzle game, it will take you some retries to complete the levels. The game is short (3-5 hours, depends on how fast you do it). All computers can run it.-If it is on sale and you like wasting your time on simple puzzle-games, you should totally buy it!"

If it was $1-2 I would say go ahead and buy it but it's just not that great.The art is pretty nice but the gameplay itself is extremely boring and the levels are not that interesting. It plays like a flash ipad game, and if you were playing it on the ipad it would probably slightly more enjoyable.However it still has some major design flaws in my opinion. For example when you level-up all of the abilities that you get (attack dmg up, bow dmg up, movement distance up, hearts up) are all pointless. When you kill a creature sneakily (the name of the game right?) then it's always a 1-shot kill. Thus, in my opinion the game should just drop all of the fighting stuff and just focus on the sneaking. If you get spotted, that should be it, you should get killed without any other options and then have to restart the level. Thus turning it into more of the puzzle / strategy game that it really should be. As it is now it has virtually no strategy and is extremely simple.The only difficulty the game has is introdcued by the awkward controls, where the enemies are moving around in real-time and if you click on certain places your guy may take no action at all and thus be standing in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Like, so much that it hurts to type a review saying you don't? That's a fair assesment of how I'm feeling currently.I love stealth. The complexities of it, the satisfaction of sneaking by someone undetected, the rush of trying to avoid guards or enemies. Thats all fun and good. This game just feels... none of that, I guess. Its interesting, to be sure. I liked the idea, and difficulty is no stranger to the Stealth genre (is it a genre now? I'm unsure.) That said, I can't help but find myself fuming by the time I botch the timing for the 53rd time.This game feels like it was made SPECIFICALLY for turn based gameplay, similar to the (understandably basic) battle system. It feels like it should've been that kind of game, similar to that of Invisible Inc. That said, its not. Its realtime until battle, which causes a lot of deaths, because guess what? You got the timing wrong by what was barely a pixel, and are currently getting a comfy♥♥♥♥♥shaving by the local guard.So yeah, I honestly can't reccomend this, even to diehard stealth gamers.

,Recommended,259410,21009180,"Posted: 6 February, 2016",all,Tactrix,This is a good game with exception to of 2 problems. #1 they never bothered to debug the movement squares so what happens is sometimes when you click the square below you for no apparent reason your guy moves in another direction as if to walk around but there's nothing in the way so instead what ends up happening is he gets spotted and ends up fighting.  #2 the engagements take a painfully long time. They need to be speed up A LOT. Other then that it's a pretty good game I think.
,Not Recommended,259410,16555641,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,HaikenEdge,"Almost a competent game, but the stealth elements are basic and the level designs are tedious, and even though the game has a nice visual aesthetic and even has good concepts, the game's controls will very often fight you by being unresponsive, which can lead to a lot of situations where stealth is blown because the game's engine seems to work on ticks, rather than in real time, so there are times where enemies will detect you in squares you aren't actually in, but have just left, or because the pathfinding is bad and you've walked into the path of an enemy, when you want to go in another direction. Most of the time spent in this game is either waiting for enemies to move into or out of position, or quitting and rejoining a map because of one of the previously mentioned problems.Basically, good ideas, bad design and execution. 4/10"

This game offered a surprising amount of challenge that motivated me to attain a high score in every level.It has lite RPG elements but its core identity is of a strategy game where you sneak your way past through enemies and obstacles in the best possible way. Doing so nets you a big score which grants you higher experience points that allows you to level up your characters statistics. When you level up, more strategic options become available to you. Although I did feel that the last few levels became too easy but nevertheless, it was fun getting the game to 100% completion.In this game, you are ultimately rewarded for being, as the title says, sneaky.

(This is actually a confusing thing to call a pro. There are those, myself included, who prefers hard games with a lot of challenge.The cons:- A little repetitive, but either way, the game is short.- Some confusing detection mechanics, where the mob sees you, but don´t see at all (still haven´t gotten the trick on this).- The lack of a map makes you get lost in some maps, without knowing each way you went the first time.

It's a simple concept that doesn't have much depth or challenge, but the strategy involved in taking out enemies, as well as the pleasant art style and music, helps to keep you engaged. It even has a couple surprises, such as lighting your arrows on fire by shooting them through torches, which is appropriately rewarded with extra goodies. My biggest dissappointment is that they didn't go further with stuff like that. Had they done so, I would have given the game five stars. Neverthless, it's still a fairly good game that I was happy to support for the price. Some people complain that the game is too short, but with such a lack of depth, I think it would actually suffer from being much longer. I hope that this company releases more games like this that are a little more challenging, but for now, I'll recommend this one as a decent time-killer."

I highly recommend it for players who are thiefs inside their hearts and always wants to kill everyone silently. The bow in combination with a (long time) 3 slot quiver does finally sometimes require even the best thief to use his knife. However, I think the difficulty might be too low for some people. Even though I like to play on easy mode, some require a ""survival"" mode, which is not provided here.This is a perfect game on my steam profile and I only needed 3 hours to do everything.

The game also lacks any real polish in its mechanics, so issues arise any time the game moves between real-time and turn-based time. For example: attack too late and your sword swing misses and the enemy detects you, move too late and enemies detect you behind a wall or outside their vision range.Obviously it's a mobile port, so the game isn't terribly complicated. Don't expect to distract enemies with anything other than meat, and don't expect alternate routes or strategies. Some things are questionable for a mobile game as well - clicking on an empty space will move your character towards that space, but the game is not smart enough to understand that clicking on an enemy or breakable means move and attack.Wait for a sale."

The music and minimal storyline seem to work well together as a package while not being overly distracting. You sneak, you get gems, you escape.
