The combat is user-controlled and terrific, the equipment altering interface is very simplified yet is made complex by the innumerable additions and expansions found throughout the game.  And if you like loot, well, this game has a TON of it.  From someone who played Eve Online and found it to be rather droll and nigh impossible to be an effective addition to the world, Zigfrak ""scratched that itch"" for me in regards to free-roam space exploration games.  I also really appreciate the physics of the game and how they are implemented to provide an engaging starfighter experience.  Definitely recommend!"
,Not Recommended,259430,8048177,"Posted: 14 December, 2013",all,Whiskey,"Released in late 2012 and just recently on steam comes Zigfrak. With a name seemingly produced by a name generator, Zigfrak is an action RPG set in space. The game drives the player through a single player story but the player is free to roam off the beaten trail to explore or engage in side-quests.Zigfrak was a game that I wanted to like as I love space exploration action RPGs ever since Escape Velocity. Unfortunately, in my opinion suffers from some key flaws. Playing this game it's fairly obvious that this game borrows alot from MMOs such as World of Warcraft, which is not something I would necessarily want in a single player game. A lot of quests are tedious and uninteresting ""go here and click on this"" tasks. There's a lot of loot in the game to collect, which might generate some interest and motivation to play, but this mechanic feel a bit cheap. A lot of sidequests are collection questions that just involve collecting a specified amount of items and cashing them in for a reward.Since this game is inspiried by MMOs I don't think it really respects the player's time; for example at one point the player must battle a spacestation with a friendly fleet. It took me nearly 45 minutes to deplete half of it's health.Aside from this, the action is fairly average. The weapons don't have a particularly notable feel and I didn't get a sense that I was actually hitting a target. Instead I just held down the attack buttons until I saw the enemy's health bar lower.To it's merit, when a 'hacking minigame' came up I was given the option to fight enemies instead. I aprpeciated the option to focus on the game's core gameplay instead of getting pulled off into some minigame.In terms of production value, the graphics aren't anything to write home about and many things in the game simply don't have any sort of sound effect.There is no USB controller support for this game.If you like MMOs and space exploration RPGs and you want a single player game you might find this game fun, otherwise there are better options for you.  I played this game a little over 3 hours, giving it a chance to get me interested but it failed to really inspire me to play.Score: 5/10"

Destroyed ships litter space with tons of loot: ammo, guns, vendor trash, crafting components, etc. So much so that it can be a bit overwhelming in the early going.

,Recommended,259430,10111694,"Posted: 14 May, 2014",all,Poobah Gorg,"GET THIS GAME! Unless you're Maverick.Zigfrak is a pretty awesome game. It's amazingly beautiful, but for reasons I can't begin to fathom it has never overheated my laptop. Not even when I accidentally left it running paused and the temperature in my room was in the mid-80s during the afternoon hours (my room sadly faces west). Even games that are 3D only as window dressing tend to overheat my laptop (RTS games, XCOM Enemy Unknown, and many others). This game I could probably leave running for a week.This game is what I'd term a casual space RPG. What I mean by ""casual"" is that it tends to avoid the micromanagement most RPGs entail. Unlike most casual RPGs it IS pretty and there's a very wide variety of enemies and components you can add to your ship. No really, there's TONS of things you can upgrade your guns, shields, armor, missile launchers, whatever to. Going along with the casual game theme, they're often whimsically named. Inconvenient realism tends to get glossed over in this game. You're only allowed to carry so many of each object. Once you hit that amount, it automatically converts those items into the type of credits you spend at a trade station (there's at least three forms of currency, which makes game economics all kinds of interesting).The author loves puns and references. There's an alien weapon type called ""strange."" So one of the weapons has an effect called ""When you're strange."" And given that certain of the higher-end weapon names are prepended with ""tweaked"" they put in one weapon called ""Tweaked Morrison."" The references vary between movies/sci-fi (obviously) but you can also find weapon types like Larry, Curly and Moe. I want to hope that Moe is the most effective, with Larry being the less-interesting mid-range model.It's also a fairly sandboxy game. While there's an arcing storyline, you can freely ignore it if you want, and just go about fighting, looting, crafting or whatever.The author is AMAZINGLY responsive and non-dickish (even when folks are being critical). Seems willing to take a look at your saved games in order to track down bugs (or just fix your stuck game for you). It's almost unbelievable how responsive he is given that it's a $5 game. I almost feel guilty mentioning that it's fairly easy to come by coupons for this game...The only reason I mention my friend Maverick up top, it's not his type of game. While I wouldn't call the game overly easy, it rather shamelessly lists as one of its selling points that it's a click, kill and loot game. It even describes the things you kill as ""loot pinatas."" I like the honesty there, it lets you know that this wasn't done by accident or poor design. This game is for people who like getting loot. It's a nice palate-cleanser for my Shadowclan friends *snickers*. Money is easy enough to come by (and if you putter away a few hours in certain areas you'll be absurdly comfortable). You could also avoid doing as I did to get a ""more balanced"" experience. It shouldn't be TOO hard to get the things you'd want to buy (in the unlikely event they don't drop as loot somewhere)."

It has a huge loot table and if you don't get loot you want you can craft your own and then add looted modifiers to it. I was put off by the graphics at first but the insane, techno light show of the first boss changed my mind. This game can be beautifully trippy at times combined with a nice, pumping soundtrack.

The scripted sequences, while not the most graphically stunning, are still amazing in their own right. The whole game has this subtle humor strewn about it which makes you motivated to actually do the quests layed out for you (there's a part that the dev intended to be serious, but really you can't take it that way). While the quests aren't really reactive and I don't recall any moral choices, some of the encounters you'll run into will make you question your character's morality.  On the downside of the game, some features are really obnoxious (like the ship tractor beams, dear god), and the really slow docking (although automated). Some missions require you to dock with a ship before you obliterate the enclosed crew's only wall between them and the emptiness of space, but the cinematic nature of it makes it quite difficult while 12 of your friendlies are shooting at it.That aside, this is an very good game and it is underpriced in my opinion.

,Recommended,259430,8622745,"Posted: 8 January, 2014",all,Psychic Kitty,"Ok About this game.  Its very Space Opera Like.  The story line starts normal and has alot of mysterious things in it.  However everything is presented to you in the old school way of massive text.  Controls for this game are mouse and keyboard.  I suppose you could use xpadder and map some keys to a controller....but you would still have to click on things.  Learning curve for this game isnt too bad but it does take getting used to.  Like not realizing you have to click on things on the right side of the screen and not from your inventory.  They do a fairly good job during the tutorial showing you things.  And you can skip it as it tells you in the text.  Again massive text to read.  Game play wise its ok and takes a bit to get used to.  Other people compare this game to descent or freespace...um no....not even close to that sort of control  This one is more simple and reminds me of games of a few years ago.  In a way this is a very nostalgic game in that way.  Music is not too bad....graphics are not the greatest but they are not too bad either.  You can tell they are hand drawn or hand painted on some.So let me review...Good things about this game.Its a Hardcore Space operaLots of things to getNot saddled with stupd things like runing out of fuel or oxygen at least that i have seen.Simple control schemeAlot of extras including a plethora of weapons and ammo typesTypical mystery space stylelots of things to findNow for the bad thingsWalls of text..yes alot of text...to find out what to do you must read.some things not clearly explained so it might take a bit to find what you have to do.control scheme is mouse and keyboard onlyVery nostaligic feel which might not be what gamers want.Not all loot goes to your ship no matter how close you are...thus you have to click on alot of stuff.Can only tractor in 1 thing at a time at least what i have found so far.Its a very long game not going to be completed in 4 or 5 hours so maybe not for the person who wants something mindlessSo in the end I recommned this game to people who like Hard Core Space Opera with mysterious alens and are not afraid to read alot of interesting things.  I dont recommond this game for people with a short attention span or people who dont like to read or people who simply want to blast everything and be spoon fed.  I hate to say this but the negative reviews I think are from some people who wanted some ""just blast things and get spoon fed"" type game with ""no effort required"" type game.I will say though....you will know if you like the game in the first few hours or not."

This game has limitless potential.Sure, it's single player, but having beaten the game some time ago, I still find myself playing it 3+ hours a day.Pro's ( Simple List )- Lot's of customization, (endless loot, with random prefix's and altercations/modifications)- Loads of replayability.- As the description says, High paced combat, very addicting gameplay aswell!- 10+ Player Ships, (that I currently know about.) Considering I have just found playable ship another twenty minutes ago suggests that just because you beat this game, doesnt mean you 'Beat' this game.)P.S. I know that 'only 10ish' ships may not seem like a lot as a first impression, but in reality, considering what your ship is in this game, they are more comparable to playing styles, depending on which ship and how many slots for weapons/ drones / engines etc the ship has.-After you beat this game, there is still a plethora of content to be unlocked. ( Through Randomly generated events or Missions, aswell as weapons from special vendors/stations that can only be obtained from 'Research', or Boatloads of credits.)Free Roam!!! Not just 'free roam', I Literally mean you can travel to hundreds of different locations,  which all have very decent size btw.CONS- No Multiplayer ( possible future devolupment I Hope! )- Uhh... Aside from not having Multiplayer, there literally is basically nothing i can list as a significant 'Con'.For 5$, this game is toooooootttallly worth investing in. I would honestly pay a moderate price of 15$ considering how much fun i've had in this game thus far.To those of you whom take my review seriously, Enjoy the Game!!

I'm so glad I did.The game is simple, yet has a certain complexity with the controls feeling great and surpisingly reponsive and fluid. Combat feels great, loot flies absolutely everywhere, and it being openworldspace gives you alot of freedom you don't always tend to see in most ARPG's.The story from what I have played so far is pretty good (and humorous at times), there are also dynamic missions and random events which is nice (although fairly limited).The loot is interesting, plentiful and the crafting is also surprisingly well done and thought out.I only have a few minor gripes. Certain things aren't explained clearly enough (like how ammo works as an item), and why armour and shields are lost permanently once destroyed (especially higher quality ones).Other then that, well recommened for ARPG fans, and for those that want to shoot stuff and love loot to explode.I also made a First Impressions video about the game awhile back, if you would like to know more you can find it here :-http://youtu.be/O4cHVpjsy-w"

But as soon as the player realizes, that it is not as critical as it seem,s it begins to make real fun. This game lives of the extremes! The missions are quite interesting and different (more than go to and rescue protect or kill XYZ). Many interesting kinds of tasks ensure that even the last missions and the engame (after campaign) are still interesting and entertaining. The graphics are unique and due its overload of effects really beautiful. The huge amount of different weapons hava LOTS of different graphics, behaviors and effects!!!!! I suggest to grind during the campaign some time outside of the missions to get the level a bit up and shorten in this way the time to the alien stuff (the way seems a bit long, but you need to get the requirement just once and not for every item and stronger weapons in later game shorten the way even more). For people, who like to loot, this game is definitly worth buying."

I'd say more like Diablo II or Torchlight II mixed with Galaxy of Fire or pretty much any Action game taking place in space.There's lots of loot to collect and obtain, and since I'm the type who loves collecting loads of loot, regardless of quality, and taking time to compare them to each other and what I have equipped to see whats best to equip and whats best to store, this is really my kind of game.I agree with most the other comments. The controls and interface do take some getting used to, but I wouldn't call it difficult at all. Interface, controls, loot sorting/equipping are pretty customizable in the options to. While there are graphic options, they're not as diverse as I'd like. It's pretty much windowed/fullscreen, Resolution, and overall quality. The 'Overall Quality' part I mentioned is a slider that moves between 3 different presets of Anti-Aliasing and the like. It's not a huge problem, the vast majority of players will be able to fit quite comfortably in one of those 3 presets, but it would still be nice to be able to control those options ourselves.Still, I'd recommend this game easily. Diablo/Torchlight in space, tons of loot, fairly big map to explore, etc. I'll update this review as time goes on, but I recommend this."

I've only sunk about 2 hours into Zigfrak, but I've already had more than enough fun with it to justify it's extremely low 5 dollar price tag. The core gameplay is the real star here; it's an A-RPG that wears its title proudly: enemies explode in crazy piles of loot which are easy enough to collect (thankfully flying by loot auto collects it), the writing is fast paced and witty, and the world is huge. It's got all the point-and-click-y fun that comes from diablo as well as slightly strategic gameplay that one might expect from a space shooter. All of which is to say, it's a great twitch gaming experience.The game itself features a crafting system, mining resources, cloaking, hacking mini-games (which are entirely optional, the game will let you just shoot stuff instead if you prefer), and some slight inventory micro-management (you have a shield for your shield, called an overshield which can take a real beating, but once it goes down, you probably want to equip another one).

The focus of the game is on fighting and looting.  There are mining and exploration elements in the game however these are under developed.I had quite good time playing this game.  I often pondered that all that all that is missing is some voice acting (and cut scenes).The good:1. Many epic space battles.  So much so that it becomes common and boring after a while.2. Great variety of equipment.The bad:3. It can be hard to spot your currently targeted enemy especially if the action becomes hectic or the enemy is far away.  A brighter color rectangle would have helped.4. All the areas are basically the same.  The backgrounds are flat and does not change no matter how much you move.5. Some background space stuff would have been nice.  This would have assisted in the creating the feeling of a lifelike environment. It almost feels like your space ship stands still while everything else moves.The ugly:6. Expect to die sometimes.  Especially around the middle of the game when the enemies become tougher and you do not have the top of line equipment yet. But you respawn.  It sort of spoils it a bit.7.

My collection of games played is very ecclectic and extensive, however the amount of games i've actually completed is very small. Usually games don't seem to keep my attention all the way through wether it be boring story, overused mechanics, too much simplicity, or just not adding anything new. I really can count on 2 hands (and maybe some toes) how many games i've actually beat.And This Is One Of Them!Zigfrak was such a huge diamond of a find for me. The gameplay was so fun! I loved flying through space blowing the crap out of things, the sounds of nuclear fallout and blackholes inundating my ears. The loot filled Piñatas that are your enemies burst with colorful gear to make yourself o so stronger with. And the insanely charismatic and humorous storyline kept me entertained till the very end (seriously this game could be its own meme generator). This was easily one of my favorite games of all times, and hell, its super cheap too! Not only that but the Dev is coming out with a free expansion thats going to add soooooooooo much to the game.

While the game starts out a bit confusing (there is a lot of information to process in a short time span) it quickly becomes clear that you are a stand-out pilot from the Freerunners faction that is traversing the Nautilus galaxy looking for stuff to blow up and loot.Mixing a fair share of humor and unique sci-fi, Zigfrak offers a stellar RPG experience and plenty of options in the loot department.  While the game lacks the level of ship options that you'd find in other games of the genre, it more than makes up for it in sheer content.If I had to rate this game among other space-sims, though - Zigfrak does fall a bit short.  As I said, it lacks customization options, and you never really get the feeling like you're a part of anything.  You are a lone pilot, breaking metal loot pinatas. Contributing to the health of the galaxy is not your concern, neither is its politics (save for who to shoot).Still, for those interested in breaking into the genre for the first time or folks who are fans of ARPGs, you couldn't beat Zigfrak at this price point or any other."

Why not bring the loot-filled fun of ""Torchlight"" or ""Borderlands"" to the space-sim genre? The notion is brilliant, because it can, in theory, speed up the ""go on missions, upgrade your ride"" loop to a lightning pace. (And it can also create some very zany ship loadouts.)The problem here is not the lack of a novel idea. No, the problem is the execution of the flying and fighting. Zigfrak delivers a disappointing experience on those fronts, with strange ship handling and uninspired ""dogfight"" mechanics. There's also the problem of all the HUD displays that pop onto the screen, covering a huge amount of visual real-estate with what amounts to database entries. These elements, as drivers of the wider loot mechanic, have to be a lot of fun...but they aren't yet. They feel like they didn't get very much attention.What I would love to see Entheogen do would be to mod a game that already has fun combat and flight mechanics. A specialized loot installation, modification, and crafting mechanic could be built for stations and planets, making that part of the game a focused experience all on its own.The problem with a negative critique is that you're essentially shooting down somebody's hard work. I especially hate to do that with something like this, which tries to go in a bold direction. The developers have come up with an underlying concept that I really want to play - it's just that the actual playing isn't engaging."

The scenarios the game drops you into early on are ample proof of the ability of the game's engine to handle heavy loads, setting it up for some excellent space-brawls later in the game, and while the effects from laser-blasts and explosions are not enormously fancy, the sound-effects and musical backing more than compensate, making for some intense skirmishes, made all the more entertaining by your ship's fragility: take on more than you can handle, and you'll quickly be shredded, costing you in-game currency to respawn, and adding an element of risk to any confrontation.In this sense, and also through the game's quest and rewards system, Zigfrak seems to borrow very heavily from the aforementioned EVE MMORPG series, which makes for a welcoming embrace for those who are fans of the series but will perhaps put off those looking for a fast-paced space dogfighter as opposed to EVE's slow, meticulous, cranium-bending micromanagement. I cannot help but return here to the issue of the UI, which, although relatively easy to navigate once the game informs you which panel is for what function, is small, non-draggable, non-resizeable, and written in small, cramped text which overwhelm the player with a great deal of information, which again becomes clear once the game tells you the meaning of every abbreviation and figure, but prior to this is entirely indecipherable. Were this one feature polished slightly, the game would instantly become more useable- a sidebar, perhaps, with each window outlined, would be appropriate.However, this slight incomprehensibility is what lends Zigfrak a great deal of its charm: the game is unpolished in many senses, and has a skill curve which some may find insurmountable, but this sense of jury-rigged chaos is perhaps very fitting with the space-civil-war-freedom-fighter aesthetic. The madness which ensues in several of the early campaigns, and the endless mystery of the different ports, modules, ammunition types and weapon fittings, give Zigfrak a certain edgyness, a winning smile in the face of the recent deluge of cardboard-cutout space dogfighters (I'm looking at you, X:Rebirth). As it is, the game is compulsively playable, and I look forward to seeing the direction that it takes in the future, and with a few small tweaks, it could be instantly enjoyable by any fan of space combat and exploration."

For instance, you start out with a ""dusty cannon"" and it's got ""a colony of bunnies live inside.""I also like the ability to thrust and slide in three dimensional space.That said, I do have a problem with the interface.For instance, the inventory menu.  I suppose the easiest way to explain it is that It's really compact.  All you have to distinguish the different weapon icons is the border.  Brown/Green/Blue/Purple...etc.  Unlike other rpg games where different items may have different icons, here you find that all cannons look the same.  All pulse cannons look the same.  Etc.  I have to mouse over each item just to see what it is.That wouldn't be so bad...except the game sorts everything for you.  I'm a messy guy, so I subscribe to the school of controlled chaos.  I'm the type who would store the useful items on one side of the inventory and the junk go on the other.  That way, when I land, I know what leaves and what stays.Here...The junk and the good stuff are lumped together by category, and it also looks like by level.  Quite frankly, I'm not going to remember what order the cannons are in...so once I hit level 7 and then open up the inventory to equip that cannon that had a level 7 requirement, I end up having to mouse over each item just to find it.Did I mention that the inventory menu was compact?  Guess what? The item details end up being in a window like 1/5th the required size.  And that's important why?  It means you have to scroll.  And why do you have to scroll?  Because to equip an item, you have to go to the equip options that come AFTER the description.  Right clicking like in other games doesn't work, it just brought up the descriptions.That reminds me...it looks like there's a fuel and ammo system in this game.  After some poking around, it occurred to me that I can pull that information up by accessing my inventory and then checking the engine and each individual weapon.  I think that's how you do it.  Couldn't there have been some sort of HUD for this?I'll recommend it, because it truly does seem like an interesting game.  But this user interface could've been streamlined."

It may not be for some as i would say this game does have seizure inducing visuals especially since there is quite a bit of massive battles. The controls are a bit convoluted but my recommendation is that you put your frequent use items in slots 1-5 as the game progresses.There is also MANY references to other media in the game, as such examples as a powerup called you become death, which is a reference to the detonation of the first atom bomb, A whole mission dedicated to The♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and there are others in the game. This is underrated at best.Some of my gripes is the encounter system. even if your in friendly territory you may become a target to a few different enemies that jump in and may have massive fleets in which you Will have to jump out if your not of a sufficient level and have weapons that are weak. The crafting system is a little lack lustre and resource gathering is a pain as well. But thats the most i can say.Otherwise this game has flaws that may turn people off which is a given but if you like loot, space and have enough patience to learn the controls you may enjoy it or you may not. But i do recommend trying it. 5dollars is more than enough for this."

So far it feels like I'm being led by the nose from starbase to starbase.  I feel like I'm trying to get through these ""tutorial"" type missions to get to the real game, but now I'm afraid this is all there is.Combat seems a bit unskillful at the moment.  Press TAB, press T, press Space until enemy dies.  Repeat.  Perhaps theres more skill later on but this is how it's playing out so far.Loot - yup there's a ton of it.  You blow up an enemy ship and a bunch of stuff flys out and gets sucked up into your ship.  Wait, what did I just loot?  Spend next couple of minutes reading the combat log in the bottom left to try and work out what I picked up.  Okay I think there might be some useful stuff in there.  I go into inventory to check it out.  There's no popup comparrison to what I have already equipped so it's hard to tell.  Doesn't matter too much anyway because the game seems to automatically equip the best stuff for you.  Guess that's one less thing I have to worry about.I find an item that looks pretty decent and wonder why it didn't get equipped.  Hrmm it says I need to be level 5... what level am I?  This piece of information seems rather difficult to find.  There doesn't seem to be an XP bar either now that I think about it.That's about it for my thoughts so far.  I'll endeavor to update this if I change my mind.  Maybe I'm not playing it right.  Maybe I'm just supposed to go forth and explore, rather than following the missions laid before me.  It just seems over automated.  There seems to be not really much choice or decision making involved.Bottom line.  I'd rather play Drox Operative than this game... but I'll give it another shot some time and post my updated thoughts."

With the way loot drops, the variety of loot, and the humor in the references (albeit sans speech), it is a lot like Borderlands 2 in space.

Yes, but generally they are minor and do not effect gameplay.  Such as accidentally moving a toolbar icon and not knowing where it is stored (there is no ability to lock the toolbar), the huge but unsortable inventory, or flying through another ship.  These minor problems are overshadowed by:- the sheer joy of blowing enemies to bits using one of the hundreds of weapons,- watching enemies explode - as the game description says - like loot piñatas,- a not uninteresting story mode,- very cool original music- an RPG element including crafting and gathering (skill trees are coming in a future update),- a large and easy to use DB on theZigfrak.comsite that lists ALL THE THINGS,- and an awesome price (IT'S ONLY $5 USD!).Any major problems are often quickly and directly addressed by the developers (as evidenced on their forums), and the forums - both here and on the Zigfrak site - are full of people that are knowledgeable, and information that is helpful.My only hope is that one day we get co-op. ;)In short, if you like flight sims or space, and FPS, then this is going to be a fun investment for you.

The interface is cumbersome, there are a lot of text to read that are weakly presented, there are many unfathomable icons which are difficult to recognize nor remember, and a very rigid & simplistic combat are the hurdles you'll encounter if you wish to play this game. All of these made it a chore for me to play Zigfrak. It conveyed a very unpolished and incomplete game which felt like it is still an ""early"" Early Access. Even if I got this at a low sale price, I just had to refund it.  If there was a controller/gamepad support, combat might feel a lot better. But then again without a complete overhaul of the interface and then some, it might not do so much good. I suggest the developer to also look at improving small details like how your ship responds when the forward thrusters are on. Similar games makes the ship react (and maybe even shake) and advance a little when the keypad is pressed to move forward. This, I think, adds so much to the feel of navigating a ship.Even though I said a lot of negatives, I can see potential. Maybe part 2 can be released in the future with a much better executed interface design and overall feel. Try lessening generic and unrecognizable elements in the game. Generating fun for the players should be given the top priority."

Most of all, without going into too much depth, it lacks space combat. (there's your TL;DNR)Yes it says up front it isnt a space sim however the game seems to only include flying about space to get somewhat close (like 50-80k meters) to interact with items a-la MMO style gather quests. The combat seems to require minimal strafing and flying as far as any tactical thought goes.Its about as visually siezure inducing as Beat Hazard and unlike a lot of discussions on the game I find the sound fx one of the strong suits. The muted sounds and faded ringing of a nearby explosion with the music seamlessly playing in the background is really great. Also the fact you and other ships get ""pinched"" by nuclear warheads EMP blasts going off as larger battlecruisers duke it out is a nice touch.Overall I think there is a need to dogfight in small fighters and slug it out in capital ships so being presented with those things and then not really getting it throws you off. (to the games defense Im not sure how big of a ship you might eventually pilot, so if this game shines flying capital ships later on please forgive my quick judgement). But for now it wont satisfy anyones urge to feel like they out-piloted the enemy. No, it mostly makes you feel like your loot and spacebar holding skills are just slightly above par.I feel like a 'do a barrel roll' comment is needed, I will amend as the game develops and possibly fine tunes its combat."

If your screen is black except for the text, restart the game.Anyways, the combat is a bit flimsy and shallow, and the ship models are somewhat blocky, but the space visuals are really good. Sound design is eh, missions are usually picking up cargo, it takes ages to get anywhere, but somehow the game is still fun. Combat is pretty fast and fluid once you get down the controls. For $5 I'd say it's worth it, but a little polish wouldn't hurt."

Its not a sumulation and the handling and mechanics just feel right. You have big space stations, fat battleships and massive dog fights as well.I really like the graphics and visuals. They come together with the lovely controls and serve a immersive experience in space fights. Due to fitting backgrounds and well distributed props the battlefield scenes never feel overcrowded. And the execution of the debris helps really to ""feel"" the speed and drift you have without cluttering your view (like in ""Salvation Prophecy"" where they are way to big)Downsides:------------(1) A real background story told by cutscenes and voice acting would have been an huge enrichment.(2) The GUI isn't much intuitive and is torn apart to the corners. Some more time into GUI Design would have been great. But its ok though, when you once get used to it.(3) Multiplayer Coop Missions would have been great!(4) The Universe Map ... is just ugly!My Overall Rating would be 78/100------------------------------------Graphics 85Sound 75Story 40Fun 85"

God help you if you manage to abort a mission of a tutorial quest, because then you're stuck. You never know what you're doing. This game could have benefitted from toning things down a bit so you can clearly see what's going on."

,Not Recommended,259430,35115596,Posted: 21 September,all,Verdantil,"Tags: 1PRail - First P. Rail ShooterAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Very akward rail shooting with busy interface, distant action, unsatisfying control scheme, muted sound design, odd aesthetic choice for the visuals, and some technical issues.Hold Mouse1 to pan screen. Press spacebar to shoot. Hold mouse1 on cash drops to absorb them... Graphics look like Homeworld with an annoying orange tint over everything. The user interface is pointlessly busy while still not giving you the key pieces of information you need to know at the moment, thus failing as a heads up display. Windows mouse cursor is still visible overlaid on top of the game's window, distracting from the action. Firing guns and missiles felt quiet and somehow distant... I did not feel like a gunner on a starship at all. There is a blind spot near the top middle of the screen where if you pan the camera over there, the engine freaks out and starts rotating on itself uncontrollably. Enemy ships will spawn there. The controller use was not smooth at all and bordered on unplayable. I quickly discarded it. There is not much of an intro or setting established at all. I dont know who I am, who I am shooting down or why."
