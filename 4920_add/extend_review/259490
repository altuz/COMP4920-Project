,Recommended,259490,7853393,"Posted: 30 November, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"Beast Boxing Turbo is the PunchOut or Wii Sports Boxing for the PC. It controls pretty much the same way as those games and it has the same looks as PunchOut and actually manages to look a bit cooler thanks to the variety in opponents, even if there are only 12 of them.The game really is beautifully rendered, but the fact that the backdrops and the crowds are in 2D is a bit disappointing.You can use the mouse or controller to land your punches and there's an extensive tutorial to help you ease into the game. Except that, by the game you reach the 10th opponent - and at the same time the last tutorial - the game is almost over. Yes, there's a New Game+, but it's still a shame if you're not into stuff like that, or simply do not have the patience to go through it again.Defeating opponents rewards you with money. Money that can be used to upgrade your character by training at the gym or by buying equipment. By the time you reach the last opponent you're probably already strong enough to take him down the first time. My advice; don't spend your money on equipment, just use the money at the gym to make your character stronger.I praise the developer for not letting me grind in order to defeat the last opponent. But at the same time I wish it was made more difficult. Because Beast Boxing Turbo is a fun game, but a short one. Two hours and you're done with it.I really, really, really hope there'll be a sequel, with more opponents, a better tutorial system (or more opponents after the tutorial) and more incentive to keep fighting (or to do rematches).Even with its 2 hours of playtime BBT has become one of my favorite games.[Rating: 84/100]"

You dream abotu one day becomming a beast boxer yourself. But there is one problem: you are a human from the slums and humans are not allowed to compete. So you buy a monster costume and trick your way to a qualifying match for the Bush League, the lowest league there is.And that is where the game starts and you start to jab, cross, hook and uppercut yourself to fame and fortune. And eventually realize that youa re fighting for more than just your dream, but human rights and the place of humanity in a beasty world.The controls are fairly simple, be it controller or keyboard, requiring only either an analogue stick and two buttons, or the arrow keys and two punching keys. As you progress through the game, you are tought to block, dodge, counter and preserve your stamina through a series of optional tutorial fights.There are 12 opponents in total to unlock and you can do exhibition matches against any opponent you have defeated. Every fight nets you cash. This you can use to buy better equipment and to train your skills. Sometimes you may need to take a step back and practice with weaker opponents, earn some cash and upgrade your equipment before being able to proceed through harder leagues.On normal difficulty, the story mode took me just under 3 hours. There is a New Game Plus though where opponents are tougher, faster and hit harder.And there is an Endless mode, where you can test your boxing skills and see how long you can last.There can be a bit of frustration when opponents seemingly hover just outside your reach and none of your punches connect. But perseverance will see every beast that gets in your way K.O. on the ground.Overall a very fun little game that keeps entertaining far beyond a single playthrough."
,Recommended,259490,15747599,"Posted: 8 May, 2015",all,Zebra Nation,"If I had one complaint about this game, it would only be that it's too short. However I'll also say that the Continue+ mode, Endless mode and several difficulty levels mitigates this as well as it can.I usually judge a game based on 5 criteria, listed in order of important: Gameplay, Controls, Replayability, Sound & Graphics.Gameplay: As many people before me have said this is definitely an homage to Punch Out from the slew of eccentric and quirky characters to the first person boxing mode. The gameplay though is very tight. The AI doesn't feel like it cheats, there's no psuedo difficulty or anything of that nature. The AI learns from your patterns and which attacks you're using most and will guard against it in the current and next round, forcing players to avoid a specific pattern or style of play.Controls: You can rock the keyboard or you can rock a gamepad, fully customizable and absolutely no complaints here. Controls are such an important part of a game, they can make a game or break it and while you might think it's standard practice to allow customizable controls, it's the few games that don't that stand out like a sore thumb. Thankfully this game isn't one of them.Replayability: As long as you're in the mood for the game, there's content there to play. From exhibition missions to completing/replaying the story, or trying your hand at endless mode. The only thing I can foresee ruining this is becoming bored with the game itself which will happen, as with most games, eventually.Sound: The sound effects are definitely on point and the music is about what you'd expect: standard background music that you actually hear for a few minutes and then start tuning out after that.Graphics: The graphics for this game are great. They're not super polished high end but for what they are they look awesome and I had a ball seeing new characters and the blending of art for story and 3d in the ring.Overall on a scale of 0-10, I'd give this game an 8."
,Recommended,259490,8751446,"Posted: 18 January, 2014",all,Chris Fifty-Two,"Not played many boxing games but this one does the mechanics fairly well with its attacks but sadly the fights in the game become mostly strafing away from your opponent and spamming your attacks at the right time. With more limited movement the fighting could have been a fair bit more interesting and challenging.  The games story mode contains about 12 fights in increasing difficulty and adding new abilities step by step, but due to needing to upgrade your skills and equipment the game becomes a bit grindy and repetitive. The story itself along with the games graphics are sound are mostly passable and don't really add much to the game.Contains the usual progression achievements along with some stuff for doing fights in a certain way. It also has three difficulty achievements that thankfully all unlock if you beat the game on the hardest difficulty.Time to 100%:3-4 hours"
,Recommended,259490,8526868,"Posted: 2 January, 2014",all,Pimpir,"The game is fun, but only for several hours. The AI is mediocre and does not surprize you each time. I am about to beat the game in hardcore mode in 2 hours and I am not a pro gamer or anything. But the game is one of a kind, since there aren't many boxing games around, so that's a pro. But the dialogues are dull and the story is cheap. ""Monsterella"", really?I would give the game 3,5 / 5 though, since I still have fun playing it. Could be a nice catch if you get it during sale time."

My only complaint is that its a bit short, but maybe only because I enjoyed it so much. It goes from easy to very challenging, with light rpg elements to grow your character. I loved the art style, the music. Great buy."

Fights are short and of varied difficulty, providing just the right balance of frustration and success. I highly recommend starting in hard mode, as that is where the game truly shines. A sequence of tutorials will guide you through some of the more advanced combat mechanics as you progress.Opponent design is the biggest strength of this game, given it's much more interesting fighting a treeman than some professional (human) boxer you probably haven't heard of before anyway. Each enemy comes with his own personal finishing move and tasteful flavor text.Last but not least a reasonably diverse upgrade system serves to tie the short fights together, giving you long term equipment goals to fight for, as well as allowing you to cheaply boost your power in the gym, should you be struggling with an opponent in the short run.The games main weakness is ultimately it's length, provided there are only twelve adversaries to fight in total. This shortcoming is unfortunate, but very much acceptable given the game's budget price. Same goes for the music. I quite like it, but there's not a lot of it."
76561198017165915,Recommended,259490,8434789,"Posted: 30 December, 2013",all,Alientcp,"Well, its a nicely designed game. If you are fan of punch out, you should play this, at least once (and i probably think that playing it twice is about right to stop).Few good things and only 2-3 bad, which hurt this game a lot.GoodPretty models, nice animation, decent soundtrack, responsive controls.Bad.Remember that in punch out you were static in the middle of the ring and you had to dodge all the punches/combos?Well, this is the bad thing here in BBT, you can move freely, which is kinda nice, but the AI is so dumb that will do a special move when you are on the other part of the ring, although you can dodge/counter, why bother if you could just run away?This game is so easy (and boring after 3rd-4th fight ) because the AI cant land a punch, or combos since you just run away.There is supposed to be a special punch button, but i couldnt use it for some reason (unless wasnt any to start with).Unfortunately you can beat the entire game with just jabs.Way too short. Little to no replay value.I dont want to be harsh to this game since is well designed, except for the ""free move"" mechanic, it ruins the game. Had they anchored the heroe to the center of the ring, the replay value would have gone trough the roof.Buy it only if you really want to play it, because you will abandon it in 1 hour"

76561198036725222,Recommended,259490,7975759,"Posted: 8 December, 2013",all,XaelFish,"Beast Boxing Turbo is afforadable, fun, has enjoyable graphics, and is humorous. The game mechanics work well, the character design is great, and the minimal storyline is fun. Would I reccommend a playthrough? Certainly. For $5, a game of monster boxing is certainly worthwhile.That being said, however, there is the frequently mentioned flaw of the game being too short. In one sitting, I managed to purchase every item, max out all my stats and plow through all of the ""campaign"". It didn't take long to use up the entire game's playability, and the ""endless"" mode gets boring really fast. I played through it twice and quickly lost interest after that.My biggest complaint, however, is that the game is painfully easy. I finally stopped playing when the game asked me if I wanted to play through ""NewGame Plus 11"". The big problem here is that this game can be destroyed using a strategy a five year old could master. In NG+7, which is supposedly the maximum level of difficulty available, I, being someone who is not at all a major gamer, managed to beat the first five characters in a row without them being able to so much as pull off a single punch by doing little more than button-mash jabbing right as the fight started. If a character can't be simply annihilated in five seconds that way and they start blocking, you move off to the side, take advantage of reach with a single hook, and then begin mashing again. Repeat this until you get the fire-glove power, which eventually makes it so you virtually can't lose, and then pummel jab until the fight ends. If you can time this without getting caught in some combo or running out of steam, you honestly can't lose. I was running the entire story mode in under fifteen minutes. It is mindlessly easy to master, and after the NG+1, which was the only time playing the game I felt even mildly challenged, the fun bled out. It was mechanical and I knew what was coming.Despite this major issue in playability, I would still highly suggest giving the game a run. Perhaps, like all other games on Steam, it would be best to wait until it goes on sale. Even if not, what fun is there is worth five dollars. Start on easy mode just so you can suck all the enjoyment out of it, enjoy the humor and the conversations between the characters when you play it for the first time, try to get the highest accuracy rating you can rather than just trying to win....there is some worthwhile enjoyment here, as long as you understand ahead of time what it is you are getting into with this title."

And even though most of the game is contained in the above plus column, the simple fact remains that...-It's an incredibly solvable, mindless game.I get why this is billed as ""Punch Out with Monsters"", and if it actually had been it would have been a better game. Unfortunately, there is this poorly thought out strafing mechanic that dominates the AI entirely. Strafe to recover stamina, jab when they get in range, strafe again. Repeat until gloves are on fire. You can literately beat the entire game doing this- ignoring all of the other mechanics in the game, all stat building, etc. etc.I would play the hell out of an actual punch out clone with these assets- one that actually was a game."

The control style is totally different, there is little focus on attack patterns, there are no specials, and you run away to dodge instead of actually watching your opponents moves.Putting that comparison aside, it's a fun little romp, if you enjoy arcade style boxing games.  Personally, I love them.  Even bad games in the genre can be pretty fun, and this one is pretty decent with a unique personaility.  The emphasis on chains over countering is a decent, if unprefered, twist, and the RPG elements keep the game escalating in its early stages.  Controls are responsive, and beating down an opponnent with no mercy is satisfying (a redeeming feature in a game where you can easily be overleveled).It's biggest fault is that it relies too heavily on it's RPG elements to manage progression, so your foes will quickly go from being too hard, to just right, to way too easy.  Other complaints include a limited number of opponents, and a lack of advanced blocking / dodging strategies.So it's kind of fun and a little lacking, i.e. it's a $5 game (SRP).  I can easily list off a dozen games I've payed more for on sale and enjoyed less."
