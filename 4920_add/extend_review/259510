It is apparent there is much replay value to this game.The gameplay is great. Each opponent you face off against has a special shot they perform once powered up. The opponents you face in the beginning don't have very tricky shots but the shots of later opponents are very intense and hard to combat. You can play a variety of modes against each opponent. There is a simple duel mode in which you battle your opponent up to a certain amount of points. There is also a bet mode in which you can bet up to a set number of coins on the match. A survival mode is also available where one strike against you results in the game being over.The unlock system adds complexity to the game. Mallets and pucks of varying abilities are able to be unlocked. In fact you can unlock the mallets your opponents use to unlock their shots. There is also a leveling system in which you unlock different coin boosts for the particular modes.A couple minors gripes I have are the lack of multiplayer and some annoying quirks of the characters. When you score on characters they perform the same action upon every point you win against them. So their catchphrases can get old quickly. However, you can just play a different character upon getting too annoyed.Overall this game surprised me with how fun it is and I feel I will be sinking many hours into it."

In Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe you have a modern, colorfull design, 13 opponents on 5 floors (with different looking rooms), more than 40 gadgets and equipment and and and. This game is perfect if you just want to play a bit alone. The game saves itself so you have nothing to do when you want to quit the game.

It's got a cute charm to it.Before you dive into the trenches of this game be warned first, this was originally a phone game that was free to play with in app purchases. No no, there are no IAP here, you buy the game once and that's it, but you can tell because you have to grind and grind and grind to get anything.The graphics really surprised me knowing that this is a mobile game, though it could use a little AA, it's very pleasing to the eyes. The music is hit or miss after hours of grinding your better off playing your own. The matches are short and sweet lasting only a minute or so but they are fun.

,Recommended,259510,11068440,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,Carasio,"Sufflepuck Cantina is a cute little casual game about air hockey simulation, ideal for playing in small doses. What it does it does perfectly with a smooth mouse response and clear and intuitive controls.Long story short, you play as an astronaut stranded in a distant planet inhabited by a bunch of freaks obsessed with air hockey. In order to get them help you to fix your broken spaceship you need to make youself a name as an air jockey player and beat (a looot of times) the 13 opponents. You start with a basic mallet and puck and the 3 beginner opponents, and you must grind your way up to the rest of them, their special mallets and pucks and some other unblockables, such as concept art, pieces of background for the diffferent characters, etc. Each enemy has their own mallet and puck and a special move, but the concept of the game is always the same.Some people have said it resembles Star Wars Tatooine cantina aesthetics, and it does indeed. There's even a ""Twi'lek"" girl and a guy cosplayed as Han Solo, and every alien is very Star Warsy, so if you like the saga then you'll probably find Sufflepuck Cantina attractive to the eye. Most defining trait is the grinding, which many people have complained about; there's no ingame purchases inherited from its former app game nature, yet you will need tons of ingame currency to buy everything, from access to more challenging enemies to new mallets and its upgrades. As there are only 13 enemies and the only mechanics in the game are the short, intense air hockey matches (no other minigames included), this may get repetitive after a while. You can, however, buy your classic coin doubler upgrade, which I recommend you to do first thing (there are a couple upgrades for the puck to give you money when it hits the table and the mallet).Also the lack of multiplayer really damages a game like this one, which could use it to add some replayability and extra fun. However, the developers are considering to add it in the future if they get funding, and you can read about it in the Steam forums. I had this game on a bundle so I will definitely be investing a couple bucks :p+ Cute design and characters+ Addictive and tons of unlockable content+ Polished and responsive controls and puck behavior+/- Some people may find the grinding annoying, while others (like me) may find it catchy- The concept gets repetitive quickly- No multiplayer (although it could have it eventually)- Some will find 10€ is a bit pricey due to lack of varietyAfter playing for 6 or 7 hours I say it's a good game, fun and with a fair amount of content, but it can get old quickly. If, like me, you are a sucker for casual games and achievement hunting, you will sure enjoy it. If you are looking for a more hardcore game, I would advice to avoid this one, specially at full price, as some will consider it to be a bit too much for what it offers; I had it in a bundle though, so I am more than happy with the value. I totally recommed it if you get it on sale and enjoy some good old casual gaming."
,Recommended,259510,11955332,"Posted: 2 September, 2014",all,Attilion,"An OK little game to remember the original game from the nineties with some flaws that cannot be overlooked.Clearly designed originally as a free-to-play (an insame amount of challenges, in-game achievements requiring 50+ hours of gameplay and more than a thousand matches to win, different sort of currencies, XP, slot machine, etc...), these mechanisms only strenghten the impression of a lack of content.Which is sad, because the grinding slowly kills a game that had good efforts put into it (there's decent writing, overall good controls, balanced AI). This should be a lesson to game designers: forcing the player to put more hours than he normally would have only makes him/her notice the little things that are wrong (repetitive sound design, aberrant mallet behaviour on some occasions, too many menus...).If you are bent on 100%ing games, just don't buy this one, the time you will have to spend is not worth it.

The patrons you can challenge all have little quests (which basically require you to play even more shufflepuck), unlockable background information and eventually you can earn their special equipment and skills.In a way recommending it is like recommending Pinball: can you see yourself playing the same thing over and over and over and having fun?

,Recommended,259510,7979371,"Posted: 8 December, 2013",all,Oz,"[TL;DR -- An unexpectedly addictive and beautifully presented game, well worth the $7.99-$9.99 USD price-point in my humble opinion.]Though not a regular player of Arcade games, I thought I would make a foray into the genre when I picked up the newly-released Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe (SCD) for $7.99 USD. The game consists of playing Shufflepuck (essentially air hockey) against a series of increasingly challenging opponents to win points and money (known as ‘Credz’), ultimately in order to build a new spaceship to return home to Earth. Although a fairly simple premise, the game mechanics are well executed, and the opponents are sufficiently diverse to keep the game interesting and fresh as you progress.The game takes place in a five-level Cantina, where Shufflepuck is the key form of entertainment for patrons. The graphics are crisp and polished, with each area of the Cantina having its own style. There are indeed no loading times, and the player can seamlessly travel between each level of the Cantina via an elevator. Four of the levels are populated by three opponent characters each (with the fifth level devoted to a single ‘Boss’ opponent), as well as bystanders and props. The activity in each area is sufficient to bring the game to life, but is subtle so as to not distract the player.Each of the 12 regular opponents have unique mallets and pucks, as well as unique ‘special moves’, which the player is able to obtain and use as they progress through the game. The different special moves employed by each opponent adds greatly to the challenge of the game, as the player must adapt quickly to avoid defeat, particularly when required to face a series of different foes in attempting to complete each character’s ‘mini-quests’. The Shufflepuck matches are challenging, particularly those which require the player to concede no points over the course of the match. There’s a genuine sense of achievement in a flawless 15-0 victory against a difficult opponent.As the player progresses, more points and Credz are amassed, as well as Tokens. Points are used to determine the player’s Level, which provides bonuses, as well as to rank the player amongst their friends and the global playerbase. Credz are used to purchase items from the Store, such as puck and mallet improvements, as well as the biography of each opponent character. Tokens can be exchanged for points or Credz via a ‘prize machine’, which involves a random-chance card-flipping interface akin to a slot machine, and may be subject to bonuses derived from your Level.The character biographies are well thought-out and consistent, and provide a back-story to the player to explain some of the feuds between characters the player will notice during the game. SCD does not have a narrative or story arc in the way that many FPS or RPG games do, however the character dialogue and biographies do a good job of filling that void, bearing in mind the context of an Arcade game.All-in-all, I am very happy with my purchase and got a solid 20 hours of entertainment before finishing the core game missions. No doubt it would require many more hours to achieve 100% completion. The game is executed to a standard well above what I expected, indeed well above what I would expect of any new 3D game at the $9.99 USD or below price-point from an independent game developer.I would recommend to all, but particularly those who are fond of Arcade games. This game is fun, challenging and accessible, and at less than 100MB download, you’ll be able to jump into it almost immediately."

That happened on the original, and it happens here.The 2nd floor has a good remix of the original tune.Now, there are extras - you have to collect parts of your spaceship and thus play a lot of games vs. the characters, rather than just get to Biff via playing various others.

Now the joint has been upgraded to become a Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe. The core gameplay is the same, PC air hockey, and while it is extremely simple to play, it's anything but simple to beat the majority of your opponents.Now featuring upgradeable pucks and mallets, along with the ability to acquire special shots (so your opponents are no longer the only players with tricks up their sleeve), the game now offers quite a bit more to tweak the core gameplay. There are also more opponents, although the difficulty level ramps up a lot more steeply than it did in it's earlier Amiga incarnation. Acquiring the necessary credz to purchase upgrades isn't limited to just beating your opponent. There are also collectable credz (as well as experience points) on the air hockey table itself, plus there is some kind of alien fruit machine available to try your luck on, in order to win extra credz and experience points.The Cantina itself features 4 floors, with 3 opponents on each floor. As you earn more credz, you can purchase access to the other floors, where tougher opponents and greater rewards await you. There are also other items for purchase, such as concept art and biographies (in 18 parts) of each of your opponents. Purchasing these all help towards your ultimate goal, acquiring enough parts to repair your spaceship and return home.This is a strangely addictive little game that is perhaps a bit pretentious in it's execution. It's almost like the developer wants people to think it is more than just air hockey, as if that alone wouldn't be enough to interest people. The bottom line is it IS just air hockey on the PC, but that isn't a bad thing, many of the best video games are due to their simplicity. That said, i only purchased this because i had a coupon for it, bringing the price down to £1.75. I think it is a good and i do recommend it, but only if you get one of these coupons or if the game goes on sale.

I mainly bought this game because of nostalgia from an old tablet game, but am already having a lot more fun than expected with a mouse.  There's enough variety in the gameplay that other similar games I've played seem a bit ""flat"" in comparison.The second thing is how fast it gets you into the action.  There's a tutorial, but it's skippable.  The story stuff can barely bring down the pace, but does a great job of adding incentive to keep playing.  Ignoring all that, the game launches quickly and there's barely any clicks before you're quickly setting up a game.  It's a smooth and extremely well presented/executed process imo.The personal nitpicks I have against are minor and rarely get in the way of playing.  It being a bit unclear of the ""best"" way to earn rewards.   If/how neutral power-ups impact the AI.  Stuff like I can't find a volume control (only music/sound on/off) and the default is probably loud because of that.  For the last one, I'm catching up on my own music collection in the background anyway, so adjusted that to the sound effects volume.Overall, Shufflepuck is a nice balance between getting you into the action and providing enough presentation/gameplay variety to keep you interested in one more match.

Each had their distinct play style, each responded perfectly to some moves and were susceptible to others, each served in semi-predictable or totally unpredictable ways, and all the opponents were ranked from easiest to impossibly hard, and rightfully so. Maybe there was nothing else to the game, it was pretty simple after all, but the gameplay made up for the simplicity.Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe introduced 3-D graphics, in VR for those so equipped, and added tons of extras - a multitude of mallets and pucks and ""embodiments"" to choose from, quests, missions, collectibles, and let's not forget special attacks... Too bad that the core gameplay fell far, far short behind the original's. All the opponents have exactly the same core difficulty level - even the newbies can successfully defend against fast cross-courts and rebounds, and even the boss occasionaly fails to catch a slow shot. They differ only with their serve technique (perfectly predictable after 2 or 3 rounds), special moves (also perfectly predictable, except for Phan-Le's ""cannonball"", but those turn matches against him into mindless smashfests along one side, until he finally misses). Also the concept of mastering special moves is completely useless, as opponents randomly either defend against lightning fast specials, or hopelessly fail to hit a technique executed by accident and slow as a snail.Then there's the progression, represented by collecting points, credz and completing quests. Again, however, they're ridiculous in design: ""boss"" missions, completed to collect spaceship quests, are simple ""reach 15 points"" matches, of which I have not lost even one as a whole; characters' quests, in turn, often involve winning over a dozen points in ""survival"" mode against an opponent, which is far more time-consuming (considering opponents being as predictable as described above). And while the easy spaceship missions award game-finishing items, the hard survival matches yield points and rewards ten times smaller than a single match against any high-level opponent. Oh, and the final boss of bosses? He's just as hopeless, his only power is that he switches between styles of all the other characters with each ball played.But an experienced player should easily complete the game by beating all the opponents, right? Nope. The spaceship parts take credz (cash) to obtain, and those are collected by grinding, that is playing hundreds, thousands even, of boring, repetitive matches against inept opponents.Bottom line? Avoid this, if you expect a challenge similar to the old Shufflepuck Cafe. This remake is a shameful disgrace, just wrapped in pretty graphics."

The designers descided to expand the game by injecting it with unnecessary hurdles to jump through in order to play the various competitors. The good part is you get access to 90% of the competition relatively quickly. The bad part is getting to that final 10%, it takes a while. A LONG while. The kind of while where you could easily finish two or three more reasonably paced titles in the meantime.So, don't get this game if you don't like the original Shufflepuck or aren't really down with air hockey as a concept.

That said, I’m not so sure it could keep the interest of today’s gamers for long.The game is basically just air hockey. They’ve added a silly stranded-on-an-alien-planet premise, to explain what you’re even doing there, because... you know... that matters!  In fact, the game gives FAR more to the player than I ever would have expected. There’s different game modes, different areas with different opponents presenting different challenges. There’s points and rankings, money, a slots game with prizes, dozens of different mallets and pucks to unlock, etc, etc.There's even a back-story to unlock for each of the opponents you face, with their own little place in the sci-fi universe of Shufflepuck Cantina!I’m serious... There’s a Sci-Fi Universe... for an air hockey game!Ultimately, you’re supposed to unlock all the character’s back-stories to get “parts” for your crashed spaceship. Once you’ve done that, you'll challenge the “end boss” who has the last part, presumably so you can finally leave this charming little Tatooine knockoff!To be honest, even as nostalgic as I am, I doubt I’ll ever actually put in enough time to get that far.

A rational question arising is the price/performance ratio. A way to answer this question is through a comparison with the original: Shufflepuck Café.Doing so, a lot of opposing pairs come into mind, for example what's new, what's missing:What about the game mechanics? You take your mouse and move it from left to right, forwards, backwards, that's nothing new, even the splitting glass when you hit some background is the same as before. The one thing that is new though are the special strikes, but you could claim that they lack of originality. Why is that? They are predictable. Well, Shufflepuck Cafe was predictable as well, to a certain extend, but it seems to be no abuse of notation to approve that Shufflepuck Cantina is even more predictable. For example, a ""noise decision"" is not present any longer as it was before with the magician lady in Shufflepuck Café. You could also claim that Biff was tuffer to beat than Lord Emell is at present. Against Biff, one could only score by switching corners quickly and through counter strikes using the energy he threw into the puck. Emell uses all special strikes of all enemies, and that's it, his defence is not hard to break, one could claim.From this point of view, one could question the philosophy of the game, the ultimate goal besides of earning a living. What's the challenge? In Shufflepuck Café, it was a challenge to sweep Biff, but the predictability of Shufflepuck Cantina leads to more conditional aspects. As a game with Biff was to win or loose 15 points, this element has been transfered to Shufflepuck Cantina in form of the Spaceship Parts Challenges. But there are other types of challenges in addition: Duels, bets and survival mode. But as the special strikes do not really differ from each other, so do these challenge modes. They are all somewhat based on the fact that a sweep is the best way of winning a game in terms of time and points.And the last mentioned is a crucial factor. Like many other games nowadays, the achivement bar tries to keep the player up with the game although he already could have gained the impression of having mastered it. Is it an achivement to do the same things over and over again? That's a philosophical question and shall not be answered right here and right now.But it can, of course, be annoying after some time and this would depend on the individual, one could say.So, there seems to be nothing new and you could easily call Shufflepuck Cantina a remake of Chufflepuck Café, but not as difficult as the original, but more costly in terms of time and money. This summing-up impression rises especially after considering the complexity of the elaboration of the additional features: They are all separated from each other, for example, you cannot combine special strikes and there is only one feature (as shields, double strikes, reduced mallets or pucks)  affecting the gameplay at a time. Combinations in this area would make the game more unpredictable and it would be more difficult to sweep an opponent and one could surely arrange the achivement bars with such a new difficulty level.Therefore, the only excuse left for such a lack of elaboration seems to be the development budget. Is it?Speaking of the price/perforamnce ratio again, the graphics and musics aren't too bad, multiplayer is missing, it could appear to be too expensive after all (75% off would do). It also appears to be no game for someone looking for an effective challenge with more variations in comparision to the original."

It was an air-hockey game with a SF/Cyberpunk flavor. Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is a modern tribute to this old classic, in a less dark atmosphere but still full of sci-fi references from Star Wars to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."

The developers really took every aspect of the VR world in consideration which means that every text windows as been made perfectly readable for the eyes and no useless motions has been added which could've caused some motion sickness. The graphics are nice and the 3D environnements is quite immersive for that type of simple game. I've heard some people saying that it's repetitive, well it's a shufflepuck game so you definitely have to do alot of shufflepucking hahaha The game still find it's way to make you come back at it with alot of objectives and unlockables.Need more VR games from you guyz you rock!"

A bit surprisngly for me Oculus works really well with that kind of table games (btw, is it HD actually?). Very enjoyable."

I felt instantly at home even though I haven't played that game in years. The music on the bar level is even the same piano riff from the old game. Ah, nostalgia. Thanks for that nod, developers.That said, this updates it nicely while keeping that intuitive mouse control I used to love, and the experience in VR is absolutely top notch. Lots of upgrades and progression to unlock. It it's quite a grind to earn enough money for these, though."

I loved the original Shufflepuck Cafe as a kid and this is a worthy successor.It will no doubt be overshadowed by VR bar games with multiplayer and explorable  interactive environments now but it's still worth a look if you want something immersive without motion controllers.

Admittedly I didn't complete it, as it's a bit of a grind playing air hockey all day when it gets harder and harder as you face new characters until I just wanted to give up, but it was a nice experience.ːbronzestarːːbronzestarːːbronzestarːːbronzestarːːSpaceStarː"
