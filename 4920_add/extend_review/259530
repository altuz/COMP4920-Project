,Recommended,259530,7914424,"Posted: 4 December, 2013",all,EverShyy,"Savant, Aleksander Vinter, is one of my favorite electronic musicians. I became a huge fan of his music ever since the first tune of his I heard. He dabbles in dubstep, glitch hop, electro, house, complextro, and some other styles. The superb music is great in this game! It really goes well with the intense action. The gameplay, so far, has been fast, fluid, exciting, and challenging. The CDs you complete for new powers are aquired fairly quickly. I've only played for about ten minutes and already have all but two pieces, of four, for the last CD. Being that Savant is a musician I, honestly, didn't expect much from this game but I wanted to support the artist for all the wonderful songs he's made. I'm glad that I was proven wrong. For the measly $2 you need to spend to buy Savant - Ascent I most certainly got my money's worth. When I'm done with this review I'm turning up my speakers and going to jam out while slaying baddies some more. There even appears to be a mini-boss enemy and I'm hoping that there will eventually be a final boss.Pros:- Fluid animations- Crisp old-school graphics- AMAZING SOUNDTRACK!!!!- Challenging, but enjoyableCons:- None, I don't know what else I could ask for with the small $2 price tag.Bottom line:If you're a fan of electronic music, or Savant himself, then you should immediately buy this game. Anyone could play it and enjoy themselves for at least an hour. Seriously, guys and gals, it's no more expensive than a candybar but the gameplay, plus the music, is a much sweeter experience!"

It’s got much replay value with beating previous high-scores and attempting to be ranked in the leaderboards.

Savant - Ascent is available on Steam, Google Play, and the App Store.GameplayShooting and dodging are the game's main gameplay mechanics. The player shoots a burst of bullets before the shots become rapid-fire, dodging and taking down mobs also builds up energy that make your shots stronger.

There is also boss battles, which are challenging if the player fails to notice patterns and are careless. The enemies come in hordes, and if they’re not picked off in the order they spawn then you may have some crowd control to deal with, the burst shots help a lot with that.

Savant - Ascent is available on Steam, Google Play, and the App Store.Story:Savant has been expelled from his tower by an evil Orb, as a result he needs to shoot and dodge his way back up the tower, defeating waves of enemies as he ascends.Higher up the tower are even more powerful enemies, enemies against which your skill will truly be tested. Are you ready for the challenge that lies beyond the tower?Gameplay:Shooting and dodging are the game's main gameplay mechanics.

Good old arcade-style gameplay model, which give the game a high replay value.Now, the Void Update.With the Void Update a whole other section was added to the game, and this section is much, much harder. It adds more enemies with different mechanics, and it also adds a new boss, which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to beat, to say the least.Visual:The graphics are an overload of visual stimulation. The sprites are fairly detailed and animations are fluous. Explosions and shots are brightly coloured and debris and particle effects are eye candy. Amazing art. Just wait until you fight the space-samurai, just wait.Sound:8-bit sound effects and Savant’s music make this game’s audio something unique but at the same time nostalgic. Aleksander Vinter (Savant) has savant syndrome, this makes him able to remember every musical sound he’s ever heard as well as make massive amounts of music in short periods of time. In his lifetime he’s made over 10,000 songs; since adopting the alias “Savant” he has released eleven albums, seven EPs, and twelve singles. He has no definitive genre or sound, and is constantly experimenting with his music.For this game he chose most songs from his dubstep-sounding albums: Alchemist, Cult, ISM, Ninur, Orakel, Vario, and Overkill. Not including the musical scores made specifically for the game.Final Thoughts:Gameplay this simple and this addicting takes ingenuity to develop. D-Pad Studios took a world based on Savant’s music and fleshed it out into a full universe. The Alchemist from the album Alchemist, Vario from the album Vario, and the Samurai from the album Protos.Personally, I bought this game simply because I’m a huge fan, had ‘Savant’ in its name, and because the trailer was featuring his music. What I was surprised to encounter was a ridiculously fun game with an amazing soundtrack and crazy good visuals. A must have for Savant fans and twin stick shooters alike."

The way the music perfectly intertwines with the hordes of grunts rushing at you is oddly therapeutical.Having the giant worm try to kill you without the music in the game would defeat the purpose of this game and just make it damn plain boring, mostly because of the way the music sets the mood of the game. The music perfectly suits the game not because it is dubstep, but because of the way it is aggressive.Listening to songs like Kali 47 or Bach to the Phuture while killing grunts is a good concept of the game because when the music starts you know what to do, it's as if it's hardwired into your brain that you know you need to kill them. But that theory is not all that far off due to the fact that that is a main aspect of the game.All in all for $1.99 this game is damn well worth it"

I did not expect much, considering the low price, but the game really delivers.It plays a bit like an old school 2D arcade game, the graphics and pacing definitely remind me of that era.Graphics are very sharp, controls are simple and responsive, and the music, which is more or less the focus of the game, is great.My only problem with the game is, considering the nature of enemy attacks, I'd much rather have the view zoomed out at all times (or at least have an option). The camera is always zoomed in VERY close to the character and the only way to see enemies is to pan with your cursor, which you're already using for shooting 100% of the time... So even though you're given off-screen markers for charging enemies, that's still far from ideal.Also, no Steam overlay on Mac (yet?), meaning no achievements or screenshots for Mac users."

When I bought, for 2$, I never expected it to give me so many hours of fun. I thought it would be a 15 minutes game and that I'd never launch it again after finishing it. Looking at my time in game might inform you of how wrong I was.Short version : If you're looking for a 2D shmup with an awesome OST, go for it.Longer version : I was already a fan of Savant and his other works (as Vinter in Hollywood/Vegas, and his other band names) before knowing the game. When I discovered the game, I didn't think I'd appreciate it so much. First of all, the songs of the OST, which are Savant's work from different albums (Alchemist, Overkill, ISM, Vario, Orakel and Cult), fit perfectly in the nervous gameplay. The difficulty which increases along the levels is here, but it isn't too big, and it permits to have fun even after the twentieth try (gotta admit I ragequited a few times, but that's another story). And when you're finished with the five levels and if you love tryharding and competition, you'll love the Endless and Time Trial mode, which require some patience and skills (and ragequits) to master. Also, the characters from Savant's lore like Vario, the Samurai (spoiler : they are the bosses (spoiler: they're ♥♥♥♥ing hard at first)) and the Alchemist (the protagonist, who can be seen on Alchemist's album cover) aren't too much (I don't know how to say it, so I'll just assume you got the idea). The only thing that's bad for the game in my opinion are the bugs, but they're funnier than boring and the developer listens to the player and push updates from time to time.tl;dr savant memes tryhard godlike ost GOTY (got it ?) game 10/10"

It revolves around a mysterious figure, who aims to climb a tower in order to find the secret source of magic. Countless and diverse types of enemies try to hinder him and you need to help him getting rid of the evil forces that guard the philosopher's stone.Design & ArtThe game is nicely designed and features an original gothical artstyle. The character and enemies look very detailed and well animated. In my opinion, the visuals were crafted with tender, love and care, they positively enhance the atmosphere of the game.ControlsControls are pretty straightforward; you aim with the mouse and the game offers a tutorial for the moves you are able to do. Also, the Savant - Ascent features complete controller support, for people who want to play that way. Nice!Sound & MusicThe soundtrack is what keeps this game alive. The game features a set of electronic/dubstep songs, that accompany you during your play. In my opinion, the music is really awesome and makes the game feel more arcady, even without repeating chiptunes!Sounds are nice too. Overall, the sound of the game enhances the gameplay and lets you feel the action from start to finish. It really feels like you are playing an arcade game!GameplayThe gameplay is kept simple: you, enemies, shooting, surviving. You aim in the general direction enemies are in and shoot. That's it. Disc parts you can find or unlock throughout the game will give you a new track you can listen to, but they also grant you a special power (more damage etc.). There are different powers and all of them make you somewhat stronger. Try to find all of them, in order to beat the endgame content this game has to offer!Chain up kills to increase your score multiplier and reach that sweet, sweet highscore in the leaderboards. But be careful not to get hit, since it reduces your multiplier, aswell as your lives. Three hits and it is game over for you!Next to a small story, this game features and endless mode, in which you have to survive as long as possible (and consecutively gain very many points). Lastly, there is a timed mode for the storymode, in which you will need to beat the game as fast as possible. Small eastereggs are also included.WeakpointsUnfortunatly, music is (as always) a matter of taste. If you feel a strong dislike for said music, I would advise against buying this product.Be aware of the fact that this game is short and might not keep you engaged for a very long time. Fortunatly, the shortness is compensated with its price. Consider it a tasty snack you discover, so tasty you want to savor it by not eating it too often.Concluding ThoughtsSavant - Ascent is a game that could really be called a new age arcade game.For a game that small in size and content, I really had lots of fun with it. The soundtrack enhanced my complete experience with it and kept my heart pumping and my head banging. The gameplay feels overly satisfying, wrecking some enemies with POWER OVERWHELMING has never felt that good for me.So you should definetly give it a try, because Savant - Ascent took the term ""Brevity is the soul of wit."" and ""Sometimes, less is more."" very literal. So literal, that I can't even believe I didn't spend more than two dollars on this game.Friendly advice: Just be careful not to headbang too much or you'll wake up with neck muscle hangover the next day."

You have to unlock abilities though, by collecting CD shards. There are 4 of these abilities and you can't beat the final boss without at least 1 of them, so don't worry about dying on the way there, since that is the only way to turn in your CD shards.This is really interesting idea, a sort of micro-game to promote Savant's music, while actually being pretty fun to play."

It will probably take you tons of tries to complete the story mode unless you're like some machine. But once you beat it, it will be easy. I probably died 30 times trying to complete it.

The soundtrack alone would be a steal but you get an excellent game too!The core gameplay of Savant - Ascent is quite simple but don't let that deter you. Its fluid, pulse raising action is a blast to play. The difficulty curve is just right for most of the game but got a bit steep for my liking right near the end. A steady stream of unlocks keeps things fresh throughout the main story and avoids overwhelming you. This isn't a very long game but it includes a few extras like time trial and endless modes that will please you if you like a challenge.My biggest complaint is that the final boss gets away from the frenetic gameplay and instead becomes an exercise in memorizing a static sequence of attacks. While the fight has an epic air to it, it lost the fun factor for me and became a chore to overcome in order to see the ending. Without spoiling anything, the ending suggests that the developers had more planned but it's unlikely that we'll see an expansion telling the rest. That is disappointing but considering that the story is told solely through short, nonverbal cutscenes, you can't claim that story was ever this game's strength or focus.If you like electronic music you should enjoy the fantastic soundtrack. All the songs are accessible in .ogg format in the game's main files folder (typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\SavantAscent ).

A nice, quick challenge for those seeking one without really jumping through hoops of fire.+ The pixel art is pretty darn good. Haven't seen this kind of quality since the SNES/PS1.

The Savant music is an awesome addition if you're a fan of their works. It's in the title, so one has to assume people who play this are fans of the music too. Duh.Cons -- Goddamn difficult. Don't expect to beat this in one sitting. It picks up in speed fairly quick and can be tough to progress if you aren't paying attention.- Only one track during the actual game, which can be pretty monotonous. (Not sure if you can change it in-game or not).- Really fast. Like stated before, you have to pay attention and things can slap you silly if you're not looking.- (Controller) Weird camera issues. You have to use the right stick for attack, but unless you abuse the five missile charge attack, you're constantly going to be off focus from your character, ""hiding"" some enemies from view, like the sawblades or Trapjaw.Overall, its a great game, its cheap, its challenging, and it has Savant music.

You play as the Alchemist, the protagonist of Savant's most succesful albums, (wait for it...) Alchemist. Needless to say, the soundtrack is based on Savant's music, mostly from albums like Cult, Ism and Orakel. Sadly, there is only 6 songs to choose from. the gameplay is really simple. you can move between 2 platforms, you can shoot magic bullets out of your hand. Every 4 CD Pieces you collect, you get a new power, with a total of 6 CDs. the enemies' only attack being moving in your direction and hitting you. once you get used to the game, it gets real fun, i strongly suggest getting this game, Savant fan or not.the only personal problem i found in this game, is how once you get every power possible, you 1-hit kill every common enemy. i don't really like this, since when you begin to learn the game, every enemy has it's own movements, own attack style. but then, nope, you get override max level in like 5 seconds, and you demolish everything from about 3 seconds after they spawn, washing down the toilet every difference there is between them. but hey, at least once you get past the 5 minute mark on endless mode, it gets actually challanging."

During the game you can collect cds, each consisting out of 4 pieces, you can collect these by destroying a certain guy. These cds contain songs from an artist called Savant, he makes some kind of glitch hop.I have to say it is pretty much awesome how it all comes together.

It is more a defense game than anything, as you only move from one spot on the level or another, and become stationary at either point. The wizard must shoot enemies and ...things that drop pieces of records. Getting full records upgrades your firepower (I think) and advances the stage. You're essentially a turret that can jump or move to another point on the level, as you shoot in 360 degrees while dealing with a limited screenview that requires you to be catious and prioritize certain targets as the enemies have different attack patterns. The limited vision is very annoying for me, but I can see that it was an intentional design decision. It's unfortunate that I can't play it full screen or expand it to my 2560x1080 resolution. I don't really get why there is a gothic, Castlevania-like visual theme mixed with Dubstep and 8 bit sound bytes. Savant has a nice style, but it's strange.The game is pretty fun and it's mostly a hardcore score attacker's delight. The game is absolutely brutal, and I can't get past the 2nd level for the life of me. I might be able to get further if I really hunker down and practice this game for hours, but I don't feel like doing that at the moment. It's a solid game, especially for $2 or less, but realize that you're getting a very simplistic and hardcore, almost arcade like experience that has an extremely short story mode (From what I read) and an endless mode that is just about score and survival. ."

The gameplay starts simple enough with basic bullet streams controlled by the mouse with a simple manuevering system involving jumping between two platforms. However, collecting 4 track pieces will unlock addition power to your arsenal which is where the mechanics start getting interesting.I enjoyed the music, but if you don't care for dubstep or heavy beats it will get grating on you. The spritework is well drawn and colorful, though very light on frames of animation.The main game is only 2 stages and a boss, however a time attack and survival mode are available after the main game is completed. Add to it the unlockable powerups though collecting tracks, it does have some replayability, though I do wish there was more levels and enemy types to mix up the gameplay more. But given the pricetag, Savant Ascent is a great buy and well deserving of its GOTY award."

Played it today and got through the whole game in around 47-50 minutes. I honestly didn't expect anything amazing except the soundtrack (Savant did it, of course it's good), but I have to say I'm actually amazed by the gameplay. It's a really addictive shoot 'em up that is relatively short, but likeable. I think the artstyle and the classic elements of a shoot 'em up is implemented in a nice fashion (the way explosions look, paths of the enemies etc.). A few more enemies and more collectibles would be nice.I can see most (casual) gamer fans of Savant and EDM lovers enjoying the game. At a 1,99€ price tag, I can't complain too much, but I would have loved a second story or cheap/free DLC's in the near future.Overall it's definitively worth the money and should definitively be tried out by any fan of EDM.8,5/10 :)P.S.

The levels are challenging, and the music is enough to keep you going through the whole thing.Problem is, the golden robots with CD pieces have WAAAAAY too much health. When you're getting mercilessly attacked by 500 other robots then you don't have the time to chip away at the gold enemies for a CD piece. Once I was blasting at one and dodging in an attempt to avoid the other bots and then the gold bot vanished and then I was twatted in the face by an oncoming one and then I died. The way the controls are mapped gives me finger strain and the camera only moves when you're shooting, so when you gotta clean out the CD pieces you missed at the end of the level it's awkward to try and see them.But I get a little further in the game with each attempt, and I do believe I can eventually finish it.

I was right.The game is 2 levels, with a third acting as a boss. You left click to shoot your bullet hell at the baddies (There is about 6 types of baddies) and push A or D to shift between one of two points to avoid attacks. You can also press W to jump to dodge when rolling isn't an option. If you shoot up the gold baddies you'll get a part of a CD which you can use to create a full CD that can be chosen as the music playing. Not only that but these grant passively abilities to your V for vendetta-esque character. Ablities like a charge attack or maybe better awareness of where enemies are.It's a fun game, but I am done with it. After you beat the story mode you unlock endless mode and time attack which can extend the game. You can also go for achievments if that is your thing and it would be probably be worth $2 then but if you are are on the fence wait for that sub 1 dollar sale!"

Expect a challenge.Rest of the review:This is a very simple game with a lot of charm.  The dubstep music is very welcoming and is easily the star of the show, but the gameplay is very well planned out as well.  At first, the dodging system feels a little too limited, but the dodging became far more useful as the game progressed.  Shooting things, while initially fun, seemed like it was going to become repetitive.  Boss battles, however, are extremely challenging, and you constantly have to experiment with strategies to figure out how to win each battle.The challenge is the biggest hurdle.  The game gives you very little get-to-know-the-game time before throwing challenges at you, but as you unlock CDs, you also unlock abilities which make the game a little more bearable.  I found myself rage-quitting at the third big swarm battle because I not only had to protect myself but I also had to protect my platforms, which were honestly not very easy to protect, even with the dodge-to-regain-power ability.

The controls are extremely tight, so if you make a mistake, you know that it's only your fault, not the game's.

It walls of progress. Rather keep speeding it up. The wyverns are great, they are a threat but slow and deal-able.I completed this game 100%; It's worth the 2€ price; Mechanics can feel iffy;"

In order to avoid some enemy attacks, you have to jump and dodge, and cannot simply move anywhere you want to on the screen. In any given stage, you have 2 areas side-by-side (hyphens are useful as hell, aren't they?) in which you can stand and shoot.The game starts out hard due to the fact that your powers are garbage to begin with. In order to unlock new powers, you must kill special enemies who drop CD pieces that you scoop up with a chain whip grappling hook gimmick. You will die....a lot....but your powers stay with you into the next life, and the game lets you start your next life from the same stage you got to last. Takes the sting out of it nicely and keeps you from ragequitting!If you like twin-stick shooters, touhou shmups (that really is a silly ""word""), or just plain difficult games, you might find this to be a solid shoot-em-up type of experience for 2 bucks.

And, I suppose that is what’s to be expected for a 2 dollar indie title. Though, here is the thing.Savant for me, was an amazing purchase. If you are someone that 'needs' a good story with their indie game, you might want to look elsewhere. This is a game that is all about style. With its odd look of Cyber Punk-Fantasy and loud Dubstep blaring in the back ground to get your adrenaline running. Savant is more akin to games such as Realm of the Mad God or even Hotline Miami. With its tight controls and literally taking no time to lean. It’s an 'aim with the mouse cursor' game, a game that is fast to get into, and even faster to get out of.Finally, while it may not be as hard as Hotline Miami, Savant is still pretty challenging. But that is exactly why I would still suggest picking it up. I mean... its only 2 dollars! When games are cheap and have such a great amount of polish on them like Savant does, it’s hard to say no."

If you try and go up sometimes it jumps up other times it acts like an actual savant and does what ever it wants regardless of your input. The game is solid in every respect except the dodging. it is remarkly slow in that regard you might as well dodge yesterday if you want to avoid something. That only works when the objects don't take a straight line because they can and will make it impossible to dodge regardless of your actions and at that point the game becomes a lesson in futility......If you fix the dodgin mechanics the game will be epic. As it is I only play it when I want to play a game where you can't dodge at all.

First of all I purchased this game to support Savant, he's an awesome artist and a cool guy in general. I didn't expect much looking at the pricetag so I entered the game with very low expectations, the first few minutes of the game were confusing but I noticed (and instantly liked) one of savants songs playing as I shot laser beams at the flying metal robot things. I died a few times and got kind of frustrated but then I noticed that I had found 4 parts of a Golden CD. I was pleased to find that I had unlocked a new song and a new ability so I figured, why not play some more! A few minutes later I had found another CD with a new and epic ability and I really started liking the game, however it is not a long game by any means, I was done after half an hour or so... Again I was going to put down the game, generally pleased with how it played out... But then I noticed  the ""survival"" and ""time attack"" modes with leaderboards. So far I have had a blast with those for 2 hours and I do not think I will stop enjoying them soon.One of the greatest things about this game is the community (the steam Community Hub that is) I went on the forum only to find that some guy were giving out free games to whoever beats his incredible leaderboard ranks, and generally people seem to be very friendly and polite to eachother.Great ♥♥♥♥ing game! 10/10 Considering it's price.

It was like a breath of fresh air after trying to play a bunch of boring, generic titles...Savant is anything but boring.  Guy faux victorian hero Savant throwing DBZ style energy blasts while riding an elevator up a tower fighting metal monsters and collecting music while rocking out to the amazing sound track...yeah, not boring.A lot of people mighty scoff at this game because the basic story mode can be beaten in under ten minutes...however, the game's true fun lies in replays, high scores, time attack, and the endless battle mode.  Savant is a game that is short, but is almost more replayable than a 60 hour rpg because it is just plain fun.  It is arcade fun with an AMAZING sound track.  Even with the apparently short length, I have got to give this game the thumbs up.Besides, it's 1.99.  That's pocket change for a truly unique, fun game.  I may not put in a huge number of hours in Savant, but I will go back to it, because it is just fun and I don't regret my purchase.  Not one bit.Also, my time in this game is about 30 minutes so far, dunno why it's saying zero hours.  Anyway, gonna go play some more.  LATER!"

Did i mention this game has dam good graphics?The CD mechanic is intresting, its a bit diffucult for me as im not good at this game at all, but whatevs.Now for some negatives, because no game is perfect:The enemy designs are simplistic [Note:I mean the normal enemies, not any bosses if there are any]Pretty hard, though thats really more nitpciky on my part. Alot of people might like that challange.The soundtrack,atleast to me as its really not my thing, is awful.Now this last one is prooooably just me, but at the beginning screen, it glitches out nonstop, showing 01010101s and a few other werid things. I dunno, might just be me.The CD grabbing can be delayed, or not even registered.FINAL GRADE:7.5/10.For me, a soundtrack is a BIG part of a game, and thats why im not giving it like a 8 or 9.

All-in-all, it plays like a stationary shooter, where you must fire at enemies around you before moving to the next area.

The game is really great, but sadly lacks content. You beat the story mode in about 15 minutes I'd say unless you continuously die.

Thinking this game was metal-inspired and reading raving reviews about the soundtrack I bought it on sale. Turns out the soundtrack is comprised of terrible chip-tuned styled dubstep. The game is very short and if I understand correctly, the ridilously hard ""space drift"" stage was added in later so the game was even shorter and technically speaking, I've beat it. The gameplay is very shallow and the ""upgrades"" you unlocked are some of the most useless I've ever seen in a game. The screen flashes when an enemy approaches! Very helpful! No thought was put into this, it all reeks of a cashgrab. This should've been a free download with a digital music purchase by from this Savant guy. I wouldn't be surprised if it actually was at some point, but I'm not even going to google it because I'm through with it. 2/10, that 1 point is for the nice artstyle."

So i tried the game pad and what do you know, the A button acts as SPACE. So than i continue to use my game pad to read the controls that are explained for the keyboard - the device that the game no longer allows me to use.After that i was thrown into the middle of chaos, enemies coming from all directions, a game pad as my only choice for controls which i do not know how to use since the game never told me the controls for the game pad, so i'm blasting in all directions, some how taking hits without so much as a second of time to react and about 15 seconds after the start of the game i died. i barely knew what happened, it was over so fast.Now i'm not very fond of games where i see the GAME OVER screen within the first 60 seconds of launching it but even still, i decided to give it another try. Pressed START on my game pad to try again and there i was, blasting away in all directions, i managed to dodge a few hits, i think, but with only three i knew i wasn't going to last long. I got hit twice but still going, maybe 30 seconds of living this time and right before i could get hit a 3rd time, the game crashed.to summarize the game play, you can fire in any direction, you can only move between 3 positions in the room and they are very close together, enemies spawn from all directions, and you can only see 1/6 of the room in the direction you are firing in. you mostly get hit by enemies off screen, out of view. it takes many hits to defeat a single enemy and some take quite a while to destroy. 3 hits and it's game over.so, my time with this game was breif, confusing and a bit frustrating. bad design and bad programming. all i can say is at least the game was really cheap, so i didn't lose much at all. except for a piece of my soul..."

I saw it on sale for 99 cents and bought it. It took me all of 30 minutes to beat it. There was no story beyond some weird character falling off of a tower and coming back to fight his way back up it to destroy whatever shiny round thing knocked him off. I later found that the ""hero"" character is actually the alias of some musician (Aleksander Vinter), and the character is dressed up as he dresses on stage. And of course this game just happened to be released on the PC just days before his new album...surprise surprise.+ Really nice art. Too bad there is so little of it.+ Apparently there will be additional content added for free. Leaderboards for a 20 minute game that doesn't penalize death? Hurray!+ If you are into this artist ""Savant"" or dubstep, you will love the music, apparently...- This seems like a showcase for the artist, his music, and his on-stage persona, not about a complete game with compelling gameplay, story, or characters.- There is no substance to this game. Your progress in the game continues at the last death, thus removing any impact to death. You simply crunch through the easily defeated waves of enemies until you grab enough pieces of ""cds"", a ridiculously obvious allusion to the modern real world which makes this game feel even more like part of an album promotional campaign of some kind, giving you extra powers. Then you die, new powers completed/retained and then you start anew with no penalty whatsoever.- End boss is ridiculously easy. This fits the general sensibilities to this game though.- This is an iOS port of a game developed in just five weeks. I should have known...I would skip this and buy a good $1 Humble Bundle instead. You are sure to get more value and quality gameplay in a good Humble Bundle than with a 30 minute promotional game for an artist developed in just five weeks..."

Not that it's a bad game, but a game that can be finished in roughly in 1 hour. After that you still have Time Attack and Survival Mode, but I couldn't care less really. I usually play games for their story and when I finished the first level of Savant Ascent (or so I thought) it actually booted me back to the main menu, with the new gameplay modes unlocked. That's it ?! How the hell is that a story ? This game didn't raise the bar for action games. It didn't raise the bar for anything. And not that it's bad, it plays just fine, but it's so just frustratingly short and incomplete.Oh man, Owlboy...

Sure enough, they have and my opinion of the game has changed slightly. I would still only recommend this game to the hardcore gamers, but after figuring out that you can unlock new attacks and skills through collecting golden disks, gameplay got a little easier. But the game never really explains this unless you actually read the description of the disks after you unlock them, which I hadn't done before. Getting one disk in particular (disk 6) is a nightmare for me though because it requires you to play the game's ""endless"" mode and survive past wave 4 which might sound simple but is truely a test of skill to behold. This is where the game turns into controller breaking frustration as your progess is pretty much halted if you can't get this one disk to acheive the true ending to the game. At $2.99 current price, I'd say pick it up just for the experience at least.-----Old Review:Personally It's not my cup of tea. It's got vibrant animation, great sound track and crisp, clear graphics. It's a fast paced shooter with plenty of thrills and kills to go around. For many people who love bullet hells, you might just like this one. Me on the otherhand feel that the difficulty of this game can rival that of Darksouls, and unfortunately that's a turn off for me. The game is meant to be difficult of course and I'm not faulting it for that, but there are times where there is absolutely nothing you can do to prevent an innevitable death as the enemies clutter up the screen faster than you can shoot them down, and your only means of dodging are jumping between 2 platforms in an effort to get out of the enemy's line of attack. That lack of free-movment unfortunately it was turns me off. It's a nice music based game, but unfortunately I would only recommend it to hardcore gamers."

Savant: Ascent is a simple game, you stand on one of two platforms and shoot in all directions to kill enemies as they appear, dodging and jumping between platforms to evade them when they charge after you. The main game is very short, I completed it in just over an hour, but afterwards you unlock an Endless mode, bringing some more fun after you complete the story.The story itself is minimal, you are the Savant, who's been kicked out of his tower, forcing you to fight your way back to the top and take revenge. Bare minimum, I know, but it works for such a short game.The music and graphics are amazing, as you play you can aquire parts of CDs, which after you collect 4 you unlock a new track and a powerup you can use in subsequent playthroughs. My only gripe is the powerups almost make you unstoppable in the main story, but this is what endless is for.Very recently, the developers added new content to the game and have fixed some of the controller problems, which is awesome, if more keeps getting added, it would make this $2 game even more awesome.In short, this game is cheap, fun, and worth the $2 asking price.

Didnt really decide to buy it till today. it was on a sale for 0,99. I knew it was a VERY short game ( On time attack,it took me 3:20:30 minutes to beat) But it has something..that really makes me come back.Its soundtrack is top notch by savant. Pumping you,Making you to hear more,etc. Fitting in some cases,though it has some oddly placed music to what the game is showing to you. But its good music nontheless.The game itself is simply shooting waves of enemies without getting hit,Scoring,Multiplers,all that fair. Not grinding levels,not grinding perks or such. Something easy to pick up and kill some time,A time sink if you will.It tends to get preeeeeetty hectic in endless mode,so if you want some challenge,this game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥raaather hard.I rather recommend it for such a love price,just if you are looking for a short ammount of enjoyment in dead times."

You can probably finish the story mode in around 30minutes. But it's the modes unlocked after that, that make the game great. A whole new character, endless mode, and a time attack for those speedrun inclined. It's an over-the-top semi-shmup. It's worth the current $2 and at the current 99c, a steal. You can easily spend a few hours in the game just unlocking everything and seeing how long you can survive in endless mode.A few gripes with it, is obviously its length, a lack of epilepsy warning (This game has a lot of flashy lights and colours be careful), and as you progress further, it gets harder to keep track of enemy positions and attack states. However this may be because I may not be the best at this game.Overall a wonderful little hidden gem in a sea of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games on steam.

Its pretty tough at first, as you die in three hits, but there's a neat system to warn you where enemies are coming from. Once you've nailed all the features down, its a breeze to get through this short game, but a BLAST. You'll be rocking the tunes as you smash the baddies. As you kill enemies, they sometimes drop disc pieces that unlock new tunes, and powers! I enjoyed every moment of this little gem, even through the difficulty.Interesting note : the guys who made this, D-Pad Studios, are also making a game I am long awaiting : Owlboy! Check it out, it looks like a really nice Metroidvania-style game with old school pixel art. Buying this will no doubt help them continue this endeavor.Music : 10/10 Excellent music blends perfectly with gameplay. Gotta like Dubstep though. To me, Candy for the ears.Gameplay : 9/10 A bit frustrating a first, you die really easily and you just have to start over. Powerups help overcome this, and you'll feel like a badass blasting everything away. Its a very good system with no bugs to speak of. Aiming with mouse works very well.Story : N/A not really relevant in this case, as its basically an arcade game. Same as why story isn't very important to Mario Bros.Graphics : 9/10 Sweet looking pixel and drawn art all-around, though very limited in scope. Don't expect much variety.This game nets a 9/10, but is very short. Worth the pricetag though."

And, the worst, the unskippable slow camera pan at the start of the third stage of the story mode. And to unlock the main point of the game - the endless and time attack modes - the player has to finish the story first. The first time, the camera pan is OK. But after half a dozen attempts (there are unlimited continues, thank goodness), it becomes infuriating. Let me play already!But once the story mode is cleared, it becomes a very addicting score-attack action game. No more cutscenes, no more unskippable camera pans, just pure gameplay. The story mode works as a tutorial to the basic game mechanics. For a novice like me, surviving two minutes in the endless mode is a challenge.The character moves only in a very limited way: jump or dodge to the adjacent platform. There doesn't appear to be any danger of missing a jump.The pricing, 2€, is competitive with its price on the mobile platforms, but I would think it's easier to play with a proper controller."

The game is on the VERY short side, like only 10 minutes tops if you're good at shmups, but if you're waiting for a game to update or installing your newly purchased game then this one will make the time melt away. Well worth th $2 price tag."

As a long time fan of Aleksander Vinter (Savant), I was stoked when this game realeased. A basic point and click shoot 'em up, it's really easy to get into and has provided several hours of gameplay, mostly trying to beat personal bests! The fact that the soundtrack is enitely songs from the intesive Savant library is a winner for me.

I love Savant, so I picked this up, didn't expect it to be a really interesting shooter. So there are gold records in every level on enemies that won't attack you. You gather these records and you unlock special abilities to make the next playthrough easier and easier. The enemies always come in the exact same way, and you can't collect multiple gold records from the same enemy making it a good way to make replaying easier since you won't have to concentrate killing the tough gold record character and instead focus on staying alive until you see a new gold record holder. Plus those records unlock more songs and you can choose which one you want to listen to while playing. All in all a really good game in the first place, then add Savants music on top of it and its excellent especially for 2 dollars!"

A really simple yet so awesome game!Alright, back to reviewing.This game is a 2D Shooter where your character (Savant) can only moves to one of the two available platform, where you can only dodge and shoot the enemy. Not to mention, the enemies came from EVERYWHERE, literally. ""But if the enemies came from everywhere, then how are you going to dodge their attacks???"" Don't worry, you got to kinds of dodge movement; jump and platform switch. Though there's no invincibility frame when you're doing that, unless you picked up a piece of CD from some fallen golden enemy.The gameplay is easy enough after you got all the power ups (or CD). But don't wish that you will easily get them all, as they're time tracked rather than random drops. (you should know between normal CDs and Power up CDs from their color) The last CDs, you can only get them in 'Endless Mode' by surviving for 4-5 mins if i remember.The boss battles? Well, they're quite easy after you figure out what you need to do. (Thou, the samurai boss battle is kinda hard, as he can just 1 hit kill you)The hardest level? Probably the void update's level, as you need to keep your ARSEteroids save from all the enemy that tries to destroy your platfrom by drilling it.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention this one thing! This game's OST, 10/10, best soundtrack. Why? Because the OST is just full of Savant's greatest songs!(Imo) Such as I**, K4****, S******, and others.

Perfectly suited for every battle, every level and you will feel so strong and powerful. Wait. No.. You ARE strong and powerful ! Crushing every enemy with super-powers obtained from discs. Sadly this game is short, BUT, with the new Void update it's slightly longer ! Because, Vario boss was hard for the first time, but if you know what to do, you can easily beat him. And with powers from discs even faster. However, 2 new stages including Void boss has been added with an amazing soundtrack called Overkill. Void is really, really hard to beat and it will take it some time, to learn what to do, and how to NOT get killed. Then, there's a way to obtain ultimate power, endless mode, time attack, and Vario mode. There was also GOATY mode, but they removed it (Maybe it's hidden somewhere, who knows).

That is, you depend on the last abilities to do enough damage, and executing them is really finicky and feels somewhat random. For example, to charge your meter fast enough you have to hold down, while jumping from platform to platform. Sometimes he opts to just jump straight up and land on the same platform, other times he choose to jump from one platform to the next. And, you have no invincibility or anything while in air so it just feels completely random whether you can dodge or not.Was enjoyable until last two stages, after that just frustrating and boring."

As a fan of Dubstep and the man himself since he released ISM, its amazing to see him rise to prominence, even if it includes a video game.The simplicity of the game bedazzles me, basically its an Arcade/Action style shooter, where you fend off hoards of enemies whilst on either two available platforms, or an elevator of some kind. Facing off against these enemies can sometimes be a challenge especially for me, especially on the Time Attack and Endless game modes this game offers. Some enemies in this game will offer CD pieces when destroyed, and can be collected to form full CD's that offer 1. Sweet music from Savant's previous albums and 2. Exclusive powers to give you an advantage during play.The game offers limited controls, Left, Right, Mouse Control for aim and Space for Jumping. This makes it a simple game to play for anyone who wishes to reminisce over old arcade shooters. Like myself.The music you collect through CD's can be selected at will, they are offered as Savant's old songs from his previous albums, they are Ascent, Bach To The Phuture from the Ninur album, ISM from the ISM album, Kali 47 and Butterfly from the Cult album, Fat Cat Shuffle and Melody Circus from the Alchemist album, Organismical from his recent Orakel album and Vario 64 from his Overkill Album.Overall, I love this game not because I am a fan of Savant, but because this sort of game is so challenging it makes me want to bash my computer in with a Sledgehammer (No pun intended)- 9/10 - Great gameplay, simplistic, adrenaline pumping music and not enough Manslaughter (No pun intended)"

The Story Mode) feels more like a longer, dragged out version of the Time attack and Endless Modes. I was there where more sections added onto the game, which would allow that final boss to be much more intense and satisfying. I also wish that I knew more about the background lore in the world of which the devs had made. Who was Savant? How is he able to shoot light energy from his hands? and what's the background of the villian, Vario? This game has much potential into being something great, but I would think that the game needs a little bit more content before I consider it a full game. None the less, for the price of a whopping $1.99, I think the game is very much worth giving a try. 7.5/10"

When I dropped the .99 on this back in Winter I was simply looking for a new game but couldn't justify dropping $5 or more. But what I got was an experience. Savant is an artist I'm familiar with, having listened to each of his albums so when I was introduced to this game I was a bit excited to see what lay in store. The beginning is challenging, especially learning controls and then applying them but it does get a lot easier when you level up in game by obtaining new tracks. The game for its price contains a fair amount of content. A standard story mode, a reprise after you complete the standard mode, a skin change for the enemies and finally the endless mode. You'll breeze through the first 2 and thereby obtain the 3rd quite easily but the real challenge comes in Endless. The real incentive for that is to collect the final tracks that aren't available in the story mode.tl;drFor the price you could do MUCH worse, heck you could do much worse for more than that. If you're into shooters, and want a small time killer game with a good soundtrack, then give Savant Aascent a try."

So, I bought it to see why it was given that award. That didn't take long. I completely fell in love with this game during JUST the intro for the story mode (and for the actual game that followed), and for a bunch of reasons!The art in the game is absolutely gorgeous, from the first scene to the last boss. I mean, REALLY gorgeous. It would almost be just a continuous slideshow of beautiful frames if it wasn't for the non-stop enemies coming from all sides at the same time! This game is also delightfully difficult, albeit how short it is. Most of the difficulty can be found in the modes unlocked after the main game is completed, which is also where a lot of the replay value can be found. Throw in GOTY mode and Vario mode unlocked as well, and it multiplies the content of the game. And, probably THE best part of this game is Savant. And, I mean Savant as in his music within the game. Every single, expertly crafted wub that's created from the godsend of his computer is pure gold. All of his music is completely unique, and a pleasure to listen to many, MANY times. It feels as if the game is controlled by the music any time you listen to it, and the function to pick and choose your song at anytime is very nice.Aside from how short the majority of the game is, the replayability of everything else, the AMAZING art and music, and the amount of evident effort put into this game easily makes up for it. The only thing someone should request more out of this game would be for it to be longer and MAYBE some more diversity in the enemies (which isn't an issue AT ALL), which is why it's easy to see how this game got GOTY from GameMaker (it's community), and I wouldn't be suprised if it took the same reward for any indie games.10/10"

I was almost not going to buy it at all, because I thought it would be a waste of money. But alas, Aleksander Vinter is one of my favorite musicians, so I decided to buy it.It. Is. Fantastic. Truly fantastic. The gameplay is smooth, the aesthetics are outstandingly well-done, and I can't stop playing it. After the main story is beaten, you unlock Time Attack and Endless modes, and Endless is where I spend the most of my time. The gameplay is fast-paced, and the soundtrack is almost perfectly paced for it. There is a song or two that can underwhelm the action of the game, but this brings me to my favorite part of the game; the soundtrack is 100% interchangeable. You can convert one of your own songs to .OGG, rename it, and replace any of the songs in the main folder that have the prefix ""ost"", and also edit the english configuration file to change the text as you please, so that you can fight your way to the top to your own beats. I personally replaced ""ISM"" with ""Nightmare Adventure"" and ""Melody Circus"" with ""Mother Nature"".The menus, however, took me a second to figure out. Settings is an icon in the corner of the home screen, and Master Volume only means the sound effects, not the actual Master Volume, so it doesn't affect the background music. It actually had me bummed for a bit, because the sound effects were severely overtopping the great music, but I didn't think I could affect the SFX itself without also affecting the music. This too, however, is fixable in the english configuration file.Over all, I got a drop-dead EXCELLENT bargain for 99 cents. I would have gotten an amazing deal for it's original asking price of $1.99. I would have even paid up to $4.99 for this game, though maybe that's just my inner Savant Fanboy speaking. So if you have a couple bucks to spare, pick up this game. You won't regret it."

Your first few runs through feel pretty powerless, but every power that you unlock adds an entirely new mechanic to the combat, giving a sense of actual progression that can be somewhat lacking in cheaper indie games like this.And, as pretty much every other review has stated, the soundtrack is outstanding! There's a dynamic element to the music that changes as the enemies get more aggressive, which stretches the admittedly small music choice (7 songs, total) out quite a bit.At the end of the day, I've gotten hours of enjoyment from a game that I paid two dollars for. If I spent that at an arcade, I'd be done in less than twenty minutes. I'd solidly recommend this game as a decent time killer."

Shoot low, camera ducks low, pack comes in from the top - every time. I'm a somewhat old school gamer, and I'm no stranger to NES-level difficulty. This one, however, starts out a bit difficult and by stage two I wanted to turn it off.There are also visual bugs, specifically in the menus. Bits and pieces of something kept popping in all over the screen while I tried to figure out how to get the game to function with a Logitech controller - which it won't, by the way. That said, you won't really need a controller for Savant, it's played mostly with the mouse, which is not in itself a bad thing.Another minor problem is that I none of the resolutions on offer fit my screen, all of them leaving part of the screen behind my taskbar. One of them changed the position of the window, placing the top of the window above the screen, making me unable to drag the window until I changed the resolution yet again. There is no full-screen or windowed full screen option.And the music is unremarkable. By no means is it bad, but not nearly attention-grabbing enough to justify it being a central facet of the game.Absolutely beautiful pixel art, though. Too bad I can't review it separately."

If I can say anything, this game has to be the most intense, hype, and energetic shoot em up I have ever played.The gameplay feels smooth.  Playing with an analog stick, you feel like the shooting feels precise and fluid.  Any time you take down enemies, you feel like you're in power especially with the numbers you are taking down while still maintaining a lot of challenge.Music is outstanding.  Savant is an artist that I love a lot with ISM being one of my favorite tracks of all time, makes taking down enemies even more hype than usual.If I can give a few complaints, it's that the camera moving to where you aim really throws me off.  If anything, the only reasons I felt like I died is not because of the enemies, but really more of the camera throwing itself out there.  I also wish that earning abilities when collecting discs happen during gameplay and not after you die.All in all, the game is still lovely.  I'm glad I managed to purchase this game while it was on sale and I would love to see D Pad make more games with Savant's name to it or even more indie titles as well.

The music alone sold me on this game, but the refined aesthetics and steep difficulty curve in endless mode is what really makes me enjoy this game.Purely based on gameplay, this game is amazing. The individual elements are fast paced enough and polished to the point where I am totally immersed in this game.I recommend it greatly 9/10"

THIS GAME IS PROBABLY THE BEST 2 BUCKS I EVER SPENT. Its addicting and I literally played it for hours just trying to collect all the CD pieces. I ONLY HAVE 1 PIECE LEFT IN THE WHOLE GAME... but its in the endless mode and its pretty far into it too... ;-; ... anywho, the game offers a great soundtrack, hours of gameplay, and its only 2 bucks.

,Recommended,259530,13951642,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,REQUIN,"SAVANT Ascent is perhaps one of the most worthwhile purchases on steam I have made during my time on this platform. For the very low price of 1.99, this game provides an endless arcade mode and leaderboards, along with incredible art and satisfying animation, and a challenging campaign. In addition to visuals, this game has controls that new players can pick up in a matter of seconds. As for the music, this game is based off of the electronic dance music producer, Savant, so the entire soundtrack is looped versions of songs from ISM, Love, and others. Even if you don't like the EDM scene, this game really feels like it packs a punch, and is definitely worth a try if you're into constant action."
