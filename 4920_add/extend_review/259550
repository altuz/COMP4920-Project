The game style blends elements of point-and-click adventure games, resource management/economy games, and role-playing games.  It is extremely casual (I don’t even think you can lose) and relaxing, but also is rewarding.  I can see how some people may find it monotonous, but I personally found it addictive and gratifying.First and foremost, I want to underline the casual and simplistic nature of this game.  I can appreciate an epic, immersive, huge-budget AAA title as much as the next guy; but I also really enjoy casual games for those moments when I want to get myZenon and play something “lite.”  This game is great for that kind of situation… but if you are someone who prefers the AAA epics,Hero of the Kingdomlikely won’t tickle your fancy.The game plays as a point-and-click adventure, essentially— with an inventory and a narrative.  In order to progress (i.e.: complete quests) you must pass inventory checks that determine if you have enough of specific items.  Thus, playing the game boils down to growing your inventory in two ways.  By finding camouflaged objects on the screen and clicking on them.  And by bartering with the NPCs; there are numerous profitable NPC-trading loops that can be used to make money and buy inventory items you need.The narrative is extremely light; there are very few total lines of text.  While it isn’tbad, it also is easily forgettable.  But it does a good enough job creating a feeling of advancement and incentive as you complete quests.  There are also a lot of well-spaced achievements (both in game and on Steam) that pop-up often to keep the game feeling rewarding as you progress through the campaign.For those who seek more intense gaming experiences, you may find this game somewhat tedious.  However, if you like tranquil, addictive games that are rewarding, there is a good chance you will enjoyHero of the Kingdom.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!"

Its an easy-to-get-in-to point and clicker game in a medieval fantasy setting which you will play through in a day or two. Took me 6 hours to complete, and i was achievement hunting so dont expect a long story and the replay value of the game is close to zero as its going to be exactly the same. And you cant really fail in this game, its very much story driven by a somewhat unintresting story. I had a few nice hours with it though."

To do so would be a disservice to the gamer and to Hero of the Kingdom, as there is a lot more under the surface than what first appears, and through the course of a short story, you will become, the Hero of the Kingdom.If you enjoy your gaming more casual, and less intense, Hero of the Kingdom definitely has a lot to offer. The game interface is simple and intuitive, and yet it is also never obtrusive. All gameplay is directed by mouse clicks. The action takes place on simple overhead maps, and your mouse clicks naturally will flow as the story and the gameplay layers on.The complexity of Hero of the Kingdom comes in its economy and the use of selling items of value or to trade for items of usefullness. Should your character require to pass a bridge that is broken, they may need to sell unrequired items to obtain the help, rope and other necessities to move further on. You will gain skills such as fishing and hunting, with simple mouse clicks taking all guess work out of the equation. You either have the equipment to do the task, or you don't. There really is no challenge here.This laid back notion is continued with the minimal music and sound effects. Both are equally pleasing, but ultimately forgettable. There is nothing about the game, from the gameplay, to the audio, that really stands out. It is all as inoffensive and flavorless as can be possible.In many ways, Hero of the Kingdom feels like a slightly improved Facebook game, without the social interaction. Certainly the gameplay harkens back to that mindset, and without any kind of graphical flourish, could easily be mistaken as one. Where it succeeds is that it layers on additional systems through hunting, fishing and flower collecting, while telling a simple story about a long forgotten evil that is uniting various minion cliches in order to hunt down the good people of the kingdom.Hero of the Kingdom is a fun diversion that requires so little of your attention and so little of the gamer that one could forget that they were actually playing a game here and not an interactive click-a-thon. There is enough gameplay here to recommend to the casual gamer but only to this subset of gamer might there be some enjoyment found.Hero of the Kingdom is by no means a bad game, in fact, I rather enjoyed my short four hour journey. But there are a great many alternatives for your gaming dollar that demand more from the gamer, and the gamer should demand more from the creator. Hero of the Kingdom wouldn't be out of place being hosted for free on some website, perhaps with a banner ad - there just isn't enough gameplay to fully justify a purchase.5/10."
,Recommended,259550,9198501,"Posted: 20 February, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"Hero Of The Kingdom is a casual game that's actually very relaxing while also being very fun. It uses an isometric 2D view with a bit of animation in there as well. The story isn't all that fancy, or important, but it fits the casual nature of the game.It's kinda hard to explain the gameplay because it involves a lot of clicking. You'll be accepting quests where you have to find certain items scattered across the map, defeat enemies, build things, sell things, buy things, you name it. There's plenty to do here, but remember, it's all about clicking stuff, so you will only use your mouse. Besides the isometric 2D view there's not much to look at. There are only textboxes and trade windows here.But this game is just so damn fun and addictive. It's no good for you if you suffer from OCD, because you will want to complete most of the stuff this game throws at you, it's *that* fun (but casual). Very enjoyable !Hero Of The Kingdom II is already in development and if it's nearly as good as this one I personally can't wait for it to come out.[Rating: 80/100]"
,Recommended,259550,7688574,"Posted: 18 November, 2013",all,Paikia,"This is a cute, casual point & click RPG, where the emphasis should be on the word CASUAL. That means no deep story, no fancy graphics, no complex battle-system. Having that said, by ""casual"" I don't mean ""dull"". Not on this case, anyway. :)In ""Hero of the Kingdom"" you follow a simple, somewhat childish story, where the gameplay consists of completing quests, gathering items and improving your skills, all by means of pointing and clicking with the mouse. Also, the game is pretty short - I beat it in 5 hours.Okay, so.... Where's the recommendation part? :PWell, the truth is, that despite the game's obvious casuality and simplicity, or maybe in a way thanks to those elements, the game *IS* fun to play. At least it was for me.I hear some people moan and complain that a game like this shouldn't cost money. Well, if that is what you think - don't pay for it, just pass on it and move on. Personally, I think paying $5-$6 for such a game is an okay deal. Obviously not a bargain, but not a bad deal either. Sometimes a game like this is exactly what I need to relax and unwind. If that's what you're looking for - Hero of the Kingdom is good for exactly that."

76561198141404871,Recommended,259550,24947025,"Posted: 15 August, 2016",all,joan4003,"A strategic resource management, progressive hidden object game with a much used fast travel map and a viewable achievement list directly off the inventory scene.  Hardest achievement to earn: 5000 gold in inventory, but that is where strategy and some grinding/ farming can come in handy. (There are a couple of ways to farm in this game though it is not really necessary unless one wants to earn lots and lots of gold early in the game but it will be tedious to do.)Storyline: Father leaves son at home on their farm.  Dad will be back in a week.  Day after he leaves bandits attack, burning all to the ground.  Intrepid son leaves home to catch up with dad, only to discovery dad's wagon has been attacked (by the same bandits the son suspects) and dad is no where to be found, alive or dead.  Hearing rumors dad was taken captive the son decides to find and rescue his father.  Once that decision is made the epic journey begins.  Along the way the son meets people, helps them, earns gold, learns skills and eventually rescues dad.  But wait that is only half way through the game.  The son learns about his father's past, his connection with the Kingdom's King, and how dark forces are once again trying to take over their peaceful Kingdom.  Good thing the son joined the army and made lots of friends because he has to finance this little venture of defeating the rogue wizard who now calls himself, the Dark Lord.  (Is there any dark wizard who does not call himself ""Dark Lord"" I wonder?)Gameplay: Easy to understand icon driven quest adventure, and no actual swashbuckling fighting with controller or keyboard. (No frowning by those who are good at such melee combats.)  This game is more point and click without all the puzzle elements.  Every available thing to do in any area has an icon attached to it.  Need potions, look for the vial and have the asking price ready.  Need to gather flowers, a basket or sack plus a scythe is needed.  Need to fish, bait and fishing pole.  Talk to people with a speech bubble or exclamation mark.  Combat (for the frowners out there) is simple.  Buy the soldiers, weapons, healing potions, or whatever the icon indicates one needs then click the crossed sword icon when ready.  Swords clash, combat sounds, visual advance of the combat group, guaranteed win.  However the player will lose people, equipment, and any potions brought along.  It is very realistic in that way.Okay seems easy enough, but a lot of resource management strategy is involved.  Gold until the very end is not something one ever has a lot of, even in the end one may not have a lot.  Everything costs something, and there is a barter of goods for other goods or sleeping accommodations to replenish one's health.  People, however, all cost money, and soldiers cost the most and one will need lots of them.  The strategy of the game comes with the resource management of buying just what one needs and possibly a spare for certain things that are used a lot.  The idea is not to accumulate items but to gather and sell the extra.  One needs that gold for something else always, like learning to hunt better, buy the services of workman, equipment, supplies or funding an army.Talking to people and doing mini-quest tasks is another money maker though in some cases an investment of supplies is needed.  One may talk to someone and know the task long before one is able to complete it.  Fortunately those people retain an exclamation point over their head until the task is complete.  However there are people without exclamation marks or icons over their heads, so people standing around alone somewhere might actually have a task for one to do or be someone one is looking for.This in an odd way leads us to the ""hidden object"" part of this game.  There are lots of hidden objects, eggs, lost crates and barrels, treasure, even a person or two to name some.  (See the achievement list found on the inventory screen for everything.)  First of all, the hidden objects are progressive.  What I mean by that is when one starts out there are no lost crates or barrels, but as one progresses in the game and learns new skills not only do new icons show up but more hidden objects show up too.  Certain things like golden eggs or treasure do not show up until one talks to the Master Hunter.  Or pearls when one pays to learn new skills from the Master Fisherman.  Basically hidden objects can show up again in a location that one has already scoured for objects.  I would guess after each new icon that appears like ones for flowers, fish or hunting a new set of hidden objects appear or anytime a new skill is learned.  Many of hidden object crates or barrels are submerged in water so look close and click on anything that looks promising.  If one plays on a small screen this might be a problem, the objects are small (or actually relative is size to the world they are in).  Eggs are found in bird's nests. A bird nest's in real life is small so a bird nest in this game having the same proportion to its world is tiny.  It is white which makes it easier to spot.  Mushrooms are small too and 4 different types eventually show up.  So the hidden object elements are progressive and show up as the story progresses so go back to every place and look for any new items.Overall, easy to play, simple to understand, relatively fast paced adventure quest storyline with side tasks to do (people and ghosts), lots of hidden objects to find, with some basic strategy and money/ resource management involved.  Can often be found on sale, in bundles, or on give-away sites.  Well worth the play."

It's straightforward, short and simplistic, yet charming and gratifying at the same time.  Casual, the-exact-opposite-of-intense gameplay as it is meant to be.I'm giving the game a thumbs up because it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is and it doesn't have any glaring flaws.  But the recommendation comes with a caveat:  get it on sale.  It's not that it's a bad game, it's just that there simply isn't enough of it.  100%ing the game should take a few hours at most.  And there are a lot of games at a lower price point that can provide the same level of entetainment."

I thought it might be ruined at the first battle by going in to a dumb mini game or something, but it stays true to itself the whole way through, and doesn't ever try to be anything that it's not, which I really appreciated.You buy or trade items for quests, you can trade items for cash. To get your health back up, you can camp if you have certain food, or pay cash for a room. There's stuff to collect, and hidden objects, hunting, fishing, herbing. All of which fit the mood of the game perfectly.I bought this in the steam summer sale, but given what £5 will buy you elsewhere these days, I'd say it's probably worth it's full price.I don't think there's much replay value to it, but it's entertaining and addictive enough to keep you going till the games end without getting bored.All achievements are do-able on one playthrough, just check to see what you need to complete, and you won't have to play it twice, which I also appreciate, especially since it's story based, I don't like to feel forced to play a game twice if there's no real replay value, just for achievemements, so it's great in this regard as well."

It's not quite like any other game I have come across, as it melds several elements of different genres together, but there really isn't any difficulty involved.I recommend this title to people who enjoy both indepth strategy games and casual games alike.

You move from one screen to another, interacting with characters, accomplishing quests and gathering various resources all over the map.Story is simple and naive, but there lies its charm. Young man, whose farm was burned by bandits, is trying to take revenge on this thugs and find missing father. This story offers no surprises, but develops logically and well designed.There is open world, you can more or less freely move around the map. On the other hand, the world is very small and it is impossible to get lost here. Quests do not shine with diversity, they just fit into formula ""find something somewhere and bring it for someone"". There is no variations in dialogues and you can not choose answers of your character, events are completely linear. But, as i said, story is well designed, it is interesting enough to follow the storyline and completing the quests gives you a nice feeling of progress.There is a lot of quests and sometimes i really missed something like journal where it would be possible to see the list of active quests and their description. On the other hand, as i said, the map is small and you can walk through locations in seconds so, if you forget what people asked you to bring, it is not difficult to find active characters again and re-check what you need to do.Sometimes, game lacks logic. For example, to kill a boar you need a dagger. You do not have a dagger but have a sword and bow with arrows? Well, then you can not kill the boar, go and find yourself a dagger. Why i can not hunt this poor pig with arrows? Game offers no answer.Eventually, your character will learn skills to collect pearls, hunt wild animals, gather algae and so on. There is plenty of hidden items that can be collected and sold to merchants - eggs, mushrooms, treasures, crawfish... all this objects are very small and usually are well hidden, so gathering turns into annoying and merciless pixel-hunting. This is bad for eyes for sure! Fortunately, if you do not want to complete all achievements then it is not necessary to seek for hidden objects.There is no way to lose the game, i just can not invent a situation in which you can get stuck. Abundance of resources means that you will always find something that you can sell and earn some coins. Storyline can be completed in four or five hours but, of course, if you want to collect all the mushrooms, then pixel-hunting can detain you for long. After you had finished storyline, you can continue to play and solve incompleted quests and achievements. But there is no random events, enemies and resources do not respawn, so game offers no replayability.Anyway, game is very well designed and i can safely recommend it to anyone who seeks for relaxing and casual gameplay. Hidden gem. Very small and inexpensive gem, in fact. But still a gem."

Although it wasn't mentioned in the tags it kinda fits that genre very well. So if you don't like clicking don't get the game and save yourself from posting a rant.The story starts with the life of a boy living a peaceful life in their farm. But, things starts to get chaotic when your father went missing and your house being burned down to nothing leaving you homeless. Now the boy must embark on a journey to find his missing father and find out the cause of the attack. You will be meeting different people from small villages along the way and experience the life of a traveler as you earn fame and make a name for yourself.My thoughtsThe game is overall fun. It is mainly about resources management and will make yourself analyzing and thinking but not to the point of frustration. There will be plenty of items in-game:this includes item such as food, weapons, crafting materials, and more. Acquiring items are earned by either completing tasks given by the NPCs or bartering with merchants. This works by giving a certain item from your inventory in-exchange of another of the same value. Ofcourse, the game also has a currency which will be a necessity later on.There's nothing much to say about the game except for the fact that if you're not into too much action and just want to sit down and play relaxing game yet entertaining then, you should give this a try.---This paragraphmight containsminorspoilers. But, I'll put it here anyway for people who wants to knowwhat to expect from the game. ---The game starts with a realistic story of a young boy as stated above. But, things get weird when you suddenly need help of mages from the guild who *obviously* can use magic. You'll start getting items that is related to alchemy too and you will have to fight fantasy-ish creature not much like at the beginning where you only fend off wolves.Now this may come a surprise to some people but it can be either looked at as positive and negative.

You can clear the entire game, going for all achievements, in 3 hours. It's not a bad game, a little fun, but it's a very strictly linear game. No deviation from the storyline. No side quests, no way to change the ending, you just do a lot of clicking and searching for small, nearly-unnoticable items. It's kinda fun, and a way to kill time for a little bit, but if you see it and think it's a multiple playthrough game don't bother. If you see it on sale, at least half-off, I'd say it's worth that. But full price? Nope. It is a very short game, with a very set storyline, your actions do not change the ending. And I found that to be really disappointing. It was like a book you click through."

After your farm got burned down by bandits, you set out to find your father, helping people across the kingdom and becoming the adventurer you always dreamed of being.Pros: This game is a light straightforward adventure. Each quest or encounter requires you to assemble a certain amount of money or equipment to accomplish. As you successfully accomplish goals, additional parts of the maps are revealed, allowing you to go to new location and get additional quests. You also advanced through three level of hunting, fishing and gathering skills, each stage revealing new quests or resources on the map, giving you a reason to go back to locations you didn't need to access anymore.Cons: The entire game is a linear adventure, save side quests. If you have the required quantity if weapons, items or troops for a combat, you will win that combat, no action or strategy involved. The game is void of randomization: people are there where they're supposed to be, resources can be gathered once or twice and do not regenerate, enemies or hunting game don't respawn. There is no replay value to this game.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youHero of the Kingdomis simple, straightforward, and short.

And it's also not interactive...This game has nothing in common with RPG genre (perhaps except the storyline, from zero to hero, which is often associated with RPGs). There is no character created by player and player has de facto no infuance of its further development. Story is 100% linear and you have literally zero options to choose, except skipping the whole game if you want to skip any particular task. Dialogues means just clicking and confirming predefined statements.In fact (from game's mechanics point of view) it's just casual economical game, based on simple rules of collecting and exchanging resources. It has even graphics similar to Settlers. But you cannot lost here. Even the battles cannot be lost! To join the fight you need to provide a specific number of resources (soldiers, tools, weapons, healing potions etc.). Encountered enemies will wait for you until you have all you need to start a fight and automatically win.HotK is about 3,5h of gameplay (don't be mistaken by my 7h hours caused by idling scripts). Replayability factor equals zero due to linear story mentioned above."

76561198348999904,Recommended,259550,34861676,Posted: 10 September,all,Optimistic Player,"Hero of the Kingdomis a point & click adventure game, which made it really difficult for me to decide whether I should recommend it or not. But for now let us take a look at the pros and cons of the game.Pros:+) Story:A simple piece of writing, but it definitely works. You start as a young boy, who is forced to leave his home and start a journey, which ends in him becoming a hero (I didn't use spoiler-tags, since the title already tells you as much). Nothing new, but told well, which is the most important part.+) Art style:I have to admit, that I'm not really objective, when it comes to this point. Some of my favourite childhood games use the same kind of art style. I won't go into details, since you can look at the screenshots yourself, but it was one of the points, which sold the game for me.+) Music:The music fits the overall relaxing atmosphere of the game, while also being dramatic enough to fit more tense moments like battles or hostile environments. However it lacks variety. I'm a person, who can listen to the same song for hours at a time, so it didn't bother me, but I know that this point could also be a con for some people.+) Relaxing atmosphere:I pondered if I should write this as an extra pro, since it's the result of the former two points. But in the end it's one of the main reasons why I liked this game. Slowly improving a kingdom, while listening to a soothing tune is a perfect way to end a stressful day.Cons:-) Difficulty:I didn't expect this game to make me grind my teeth, but I still felt let down by how easy this game was. There are no instances, where you need to think what to do next or how to solve a problem, something which I expected from a point & click adventure game. Your character mostly tells you where to go next and interactable objects (people included) have special indicators. The only form of challenge comes from finding the few people, who only get such an indicator after clicking on them and hidden objects all over the in-game world, which appear after you unlock them through skills.In the beginning I thought that money might be another source of difficulty, since nothing is for free. From collecting resources to simply resting, everything needs some kind of consumable, which in return costs gold. But fairly early in the game you unlock the ability to earn unlimited money through trading (if you have enough patience), so as long as you have at least 4 gold, you can't become bankrupt.-) Item/Work failure:I don't know if it's scripted or random (perhaps I'll update this review once I started a 2nd playthrough and found out). Either way it's a useless mechanic, that lets your equipment (hammers, axes, etc.) break or certain tasks fail (e.g. making a potion, which you spill at the last moment). Both cases provide no source of challenge, since you can buy new tools or consumables (to finish tasks) indefinitely and money is infinite. Instead it's only a cheap way to lengthen a playthrough.-) Last quarter of the game:It starts right off with the story making a leap of logic, but the main problem I have with this part is the following: Right at the beginning you finish the last side quests. Once this is done the game rushes towards the end. Once you reach this stage you have all the money you could ever want, so you just jump between traders (to get the necessary equipment) and the next main story objective. At this point the game could just as well be a visual novel.Additional notes:~) I 100% completed the game in roughly five hours. My stats may say otherwise, since I played most of it in offline mode.Now to my conclusion and why I was/am unsure whether I should recommendHero of the Kingdomor not.I liked the game. It was a nice, relaxed evening playing through it. But before I recommend a game I always try to look at how much you get for your money, both quality and quantity wise. I bought the game for 0,59€. Based on that I'm absolutely satisfied and recommend it. However the original price (6€) is just too damn expensive.So yes,Hero of the Kingdomis worth playing, but only if you get it on sale."

It took me around 6 hours from start to finish inclusive of all achievements.

It's mostly a point & click adventure with some RPG-like quests and trading built in. I appreciated what depth it did have without having something convoluted or difficult built in just to try to extend the playtime. The story is not complex, and it's fairly typical of this type of game, but it provided enough to give a feel of progression. I completed the game in one sitting as I was completely immersed in it.I'm a big fan of this style of graphics. It has an older Ages of Empires or Stronghold feel to it. I enjoyed going between each area and completing quests just to see what all I'd see. The audio/music complemented the game well. It was just enough to make it enjoyable without being overbearing or out of place.There is some backtracking to be done depending on what the quests require. Not everything is available the first time you visit a zone. The only annoying thing was the ""Gather XX of Something"" achievements. It just made it a grind and somewhat annoying, especially the eggs. It was like an Easter egg hunt without the color. Even so, I managed to complete the main quest and all of the other achievements within 7 hours.The $5.99 price tag may be questionable for some.

Real action is not in this game but the artwork here is what compensates that. The game is only truly playable once. After that you know what's going to happen.

The game has you playing the son of a farmer whose farm gets destroyed by bandits. What happens next is the start of your adventure into this interactive story.The gameplay is pretty basic, but for a casual game its a lot of fun! The fetch quests, and other various side quests are pretty much what you would expect from an RPG game.There are a couple annoying features such as not being able to buy/sell items in bulk, and running out of strength after a couple battles, but this doesn't deter you from enjoying the game. The one feature I would like to see in the sequel is for the collectible hidden object side of the game, they need to add a completion meter for each map so the player is not having to use a magnifying glass to find the last couple of missing items.The game is short and can be completed in about 5 hours if you are trying to 100% the achievements.

It's something of an adventure game that gives you a birds-eye view of your surroundings and progresses through some simple mouse clicks. I have a hard time reviewing Hero of the Kingdom, because it's so forgetable. On the other hand, it is quite an enjoyable time-killer.Let me explain. Hero of the Kingdom is about a young man whose farm is burned to the ground--forcing him to journey out into the world to survive. From there the story becomes generic in almost every sense of the word. You'll fight skeletons, beasts and goblins before eventually taking on a dark wizard. While I can see that a lot of love went into this game, the writing could definitely be more original.The gameplay involves a lot of trading. You'll essentially be roaming around the various areas searching for items to sell or animals to hunt so you can get gold with which you can purchase supplies you need to further the story. While I played quite a bit of the game several months ago (I don't remember how long I played, but I remember accidently leaving the game running for a while, so my time played is off) and I didn't manage to get myself to finish it until a couple days ago. For me, the concept of constantly trading like in Hero of the Kingdom becomes tedious. Especially when you unlock every area of the game and it gets tough remembering where certain merchants and points of interest are.I'm afraid I can't give any input on the sound. It wasn't long into the game until I just played my own music over it. Despite all of this, I'm still recommending it. This game is a great time sink. While it did repetitive after a while, the first hours were pretty entertaining. It was actually rather fulfilling to trade my way up to the items I needed. While it's just not a game for me, I can definitely see Hero of the Kingdom appealing to fans of the genre. It was certainly a good time sink for me if nothing else."

I Played it while I'm working and talking to a friend on FB and I could finish it in 5 hours, I believe I can finish it in just 2 hours if I was very focused, it's the length of a flash game!The game is just too easy after you clear the Old Jack quest, after completing that you can buy fish at 4 bucks each and you can sell them at 6 bucks each in the town. The arbitrage would give you infinite money provided you have the time.It would be nice if there's a saturation of market that the player has to grind on other places for money. But with the current build at the time of writing the player is just GOD as he can has infinite money easily.And in this game money = GOD (Maybe a nice reflection of the real world), you can have many things done instantly if you are ready to pay.That being said, I still recommend this game, it helped refresh my mind during a long working day!"

One thing most people don't know is that you can actually click on things that do not necesarily have icons over them (ie: mushrooms,eggs,lobsters,crates,wood,rocks, and rarely hidden people). the cheapest method I found for sleeping is to spend 1 bread at the second zone you find. Later you can turn grain in to create flour and turn the flower in to get 6 bread (total cost 35 gold for 6 bread). Also, do not sell stuff you cannot find or harvest regularly, you may have to buy it back.If you ever see on sale for 50% off or more, i would recommend getting this relaxing interactive art book.10/10 would steal that guys wood again, only to sell it back to him."

The entire game only encompasses a small group of tiles, so not much exploring.  The harvesting can be tedious when combined with the constant need to rest and exchange for supplies.

While undeniably linear, the world is beautifully serene and I actually found myself just leaving the game running as a desktop.The entire adventure takes place from a satellite style view and on each screen of the world there are different activities, shops and quests to do. In addition to the obvious activity bubbles, there are also unmarked collectibles hidden throughout the world. These items for the most part are just another source of income but some also are part of crafting recipes. Everything is as simple as point and click, but rather than being boring it helps to keep the game from overstaying its welcome. The art and sound design is nearly flawless, with my only gripe being a strange soundtrack switch that happens occasionally when navigating through sections of the world and anything faster than a leisurely stroll.The “campaign” in its entirety will only set you back a few hours, but I think it is well worth it for how much detail and care went into this game."

I bought it at a good sale price, the single screenshot I saw looked nice, and I don't like to spoil myself with trailers or large numbers of screenshots going into a game. I was immediately put off, thinking that it was going to be an extremely boring hand-holding hidden object adventure. I'm not fond of hidden object games in general, and I hadn't really been expecting to play one when I started.I wasn't actually wrong in my initial impression--Hero of the Kingdom is a really user-friendly point and click adventure with hidden object elements. The thing about this game, though, is that it is thebestcasual point and click adventure. The game is beautiful, the music is both relaxing and adventurous (and a true pleasure to listen to), and the sound effects feel crisp and fit just right. Tons of polish all around, and you can tell that there was a lot of love put into making this game.Don't go in expecting to find a particularly detailed story, but what is there is enjoyable as well. Again, very simple, but it feels right. This is a game you can enjoy in small pieces, or devour all at once for a relaxing evening. Sometimes it's nice to play something simple and pleasant.Also, the main character solving a lot of problems by being a pretty decent carpenter was oddly refreshing. It's a skill that doesn't really get a lot of serious recognition even in crafting types of games, and it's handled so reasonably and practically within the confines of the story that I couldn't help but smile at moments like finishing construction of the water mill."

The major drawbacks are the writing has lost a lot in translation, and the level of challenge just isn't high enough.There is no replayability to it once you've strained your eyes finding all the hidden stashes, so it's a one-shot deal.If you enjoy cheap cheasy casuals, this may be for you."

The music is also pretty catchy too.With that being said, I played this game for a while and appreciated what it was going for but I felt like the type of game it was trying to be is rather dated; It has a storyline, somewhat, you're drawn in for the first hour and a half or so, but then you realize you are just pointing and clicking things for the sake of pointing and clicking them. I was waiting for a moment in the game for it to come out and be more, but it never happened.Honestly, if you enjoy ""Point and Click"" games  by all means this is the game for you, but just a little warning, you better love pointing and clicking for the sake of pointing and clicking, or else you will probably fall under my category of somewhat displeased consumers that want more than a somewhat Farmville-ish game."

Amazing music? it's a midi track that gets repeated over and over, I turned down the volume and listended to my own music.  The biggest con is the game is almost completely linear until maybe halfway through where you can start doing random quests.  Gold farming was kind of annoying.

It isn't a long title, and there isn't a tremendous amount of replay value, but it is definitely worth a play through at least once.The game is a point-and-click adventure that follows the story of a farm boy on what starts as a rescue mission and ends as a world saving quest. Through the entire thing you'll gather resources, hunt, fight and trade, all with simple mouse clicks.

I know that doesn't seem like a lot of time but i do think its a fair amount for how the game actually plays. I mean how much time is taken up in RPGs just buy running for example.I thoroughly enjoyed this game and found it quite cute, and the bartering system was real cool as well. Finding ways to make money to buy the things needed to progress, giving you multiple options of how to acquire the gold, and some items, was cool as well.The story is a nice twist on the classic save the world hero theme and captured me from the start.Like a lot of other people, upon first look it looked like a cheesey facebook game, but i listened to the positive reviews that it is an actual game and it was definitely worth it.Im not a fan of Hidden Item games but the way it is implimented into this one makes the game more enjoyable.The soundtrack also matches the game and sets the scenes nicely.All of this adds up to be a nice non linear-ish chill adventure game that is a great addition to anyones library whether or not you want to slam it out in 4-6 hours flat, or do multiple 30min sessions after long days before bed time like I did.I do think $7 is an alright price to pay, though I do think $5 is more appropriate, i guess it depends how much you get out of playing it and how long it takes. If it took 7 hours, thats $1 for an hour, and not bad, if it took 3.5 hours, thats $2, still not bad.I got this on sale for probably $4-5 and i think it was worth."

And even though the main gameplay consists of gathering, trading and doing quests, the inclusion of some objects hidden cleverly in plain view makes for a game that keeps you engaged.The story is pretty standard, but it's not bad by any means. And whether or not you're into the tropes of RPGs, the simple beauty of the graphics will certainly sway you.I don't know why it's so charming, but I don't care really. This is a good game.

If you like these kinds of games, you'll not regret it.Edit::I still recommend this game for its simple charm, but I should warn you that it's a very casual game. I managed to beat it in about three and a half hours, and earn the remaining achievements in 15 minutes.

The story itself is pretty classic, there's not exceptional to be added. Either way, it's enough to keep you motivated to carry on. As for the gameplay, I guess I'd call it a ""resource manager RPG"", especially because most of the time you need to go after this or after that in order to complete the given quests that are required to advance further on the story. The graphics are ok and the soundtrack can get old after a while so it's not a bad idea to have your own playlist available. There're also the trading cards and the achievements, so it's needless to say that it brings some added value. Overall, if you enjoy the casual genre, this title is for you."

Despite carrying an axe through the entire game, the only times I was able to actually cut wood were during the tutorial and on a quest for the lumber camp. This despite the many quests that require wood.One last thing. There are several side quests early in the game. About halfway through, though, that source of income dries up and you're reduced to scrounging across the map for flowers (that require non-reusable containers that you have to buy) and animal hides to sell.It's a nice little game with an interesting premise, but it feels unfinished and has essentially zero replay value. It'd be better if offered for free."

There are some side quests in the game, and a simple plotline that's easy to follow. I honestly didn't expect much when I started playing, but the game was surprisingly easy to immerse yourself into. The game itself calls for some degree of knowing how to utilize your current resources, and planning out how to gain future resources. And the constant to and fro barter system, along with seeking out resources along the map, might seem a tad tedious to some people.But, all in all, I would say that this is the game for someone looking for some relaxing and fun gaming."

It's short,  linear and there's almost no possibility of failure. Gameplay is simply a matter of ""find obstacle, collect the items to pass obstacle, pass obstacle, rinse and repeat"". The bulk of the challenge is simply juggling the barter system to obtain the objects you need or working out how to get enough gold to proceed.That said, the game is moderately entertaining as a short-term time-waster and actually tells a surprisingly decent, if shallow, story of how your ordinary farmboy rises up to become the savior of the land. It's not original by any means, but it's very back-to-basics. If you're a completionist or achievement hound then there are a fair few challenges to kill time, but I beat it with 100% completion in about 4 hours at most (quite a lot of which was spent searching for those DAMNED last few eggs). I can't in good faith call it a ""good game"" but I don't have the heart to give it a downvote- even if plot and gameplay were both very shallow, it was cheap and it entertained me for a while and it had a peculiar charm to it.

The biggest difficulty comes in trying to track down the last few random gathering items to finish out all your achievements before you go defeat the Dark Lord (yes). There's a discussion thread where people have shared locations of some of the tricky-to-find items, though, which helped me.Buy this game if it's on sale (I paid $1.25), you have nothing to do for an afternoon, and you get enough satisfaction out of 100% completion that you don't need compelling story or gameplay to back that up."

It satisfied my gamer OCD to see all the little actionable items slowly getting action'ed and fading from the screens, getting through the little checkpoints and ""battles"" without feeling rushed and thus being able to micromanage resources to their efficiency.Considering this is considerably cheaper and lasted many times longer than, say, a comparable game from Big Fish, I highly recommend. Especially if you can pick it up on sale.Also, about an hour of my total playtime was looking for the last f****** couple of mushrooms to get the related achievement.

The objects are not hidden in artificial scenes, but scattered throughout the landscape.  Actions that you can take will have prerequisites (objects you must have, for example) and you cannot take the action without meeting the prerequisites.The game is relatively short, but if combat is your least favorite part of typical RPGs, and you hate grinding to gain levels, Hero of the Kingdom is probably for you."

When looking at the screen shots I got the impression this was going to be a medieval RTS similar to Strongholds, but more casual. I was wrong, but it turned out to be a good thing.Hero of the Kingdom is a click your own adventure game. You start out as a never described boy that must make his way through an epic journey to save his father and ultimately the entire kingdom. You play within a static background and must click on various elements to get loot and proceed to other static screens. There are lite crafting elements. You get herbs and wheat and must turn these into goods for profit or to further the story. The quests are not linear. Yes there are some story quests you must complete to proceed, but not all the quests are that way. In terms of quests I would say there are roughly 20 to 30. I would say the average gamer would beat this in 4 hours, but total play time should not exceed 6.The story is mediocre, the writing is actually kind of silly, (reads like it was written by a teenager) the amount of clicking is ridiculous, there's no challenge to the game, there's even a hint button that will literally tell you exactly what to do to proceed. Honestly, this game is well suited for young teens and children more so than adults. However, there was just enough fun from all the clicking, crafting, and reading that I didn't mind finishing the game. Actually, I finished the game, realized I hadn't got all the achievements and played it all over again!Bottom line: This game is not for adults, but it's fun enough to keep you playing till the end.

It's not even an Avadon or Avernum. It's like a pre-school for a major RPG to lead casual gamers into the real thing - and it does it really well. It takes the hidden object game and the text based RPG and gently rolls them into one with a series of background locations which are gradually revealed as the story progresses. The story's not very original but is well told, and none of the tasks is too irksome. For the price, it's worth a few hours of your time, which is all it will take."

Got it on sale and finished it within about 4 hours with all achievements in two sittings (and then I only stopped for food). It’s a nice, casual point and click type of adventure, with elements of hidden objects. Your task is to save the Kingdom by completing various quests, with most of these quests requiring you to find or buy certain items. You collect herbs and mushrooms. Fish and hunt and even take part in a few battles. Everything you do is fairly self-explanatory. Don’t expect epic gameplay, but for a casual game to while away a few hours this really does the job. The simplistic and casual style may not be for everyone though. The game is also a bit too short. In summary I’d say it’s a good game to get while on sale."

They're little missions that you must do to acquire items or goods, or progress the story - a standard fantasy adventure with your character fighting for his father and country against ghosts, goblins and evil wizards, in order to become the titular hero. As well as clicking the yellow circles to progress, you can also find hidden items that help you on your quest, and there are achievements for finding them all.As others have said, the game can be finished in a couple of hours, but I took a leisurely ten, and enjoyed every moment!

I got it for less than two dollars on sale, and to be honest, I wouldn't pay more than that.  There are a couple mechanics the game never properly explains to you, such as finding eggs, mushrooms, crates, and the like.  (You have to click on the tiny little pictures you see on the map; they don't have icons like almost everything else.)  On top of that, a game this simple could have benefited from a marginally more unique story.  I'm not saying you have to construct an epic tale, or anything, but man, you could have attempted SOME sort of a unique plot twist.  I mean, I guess there was one, kind of, but it was the sort of thing you've probably seen a million times before.One of my biggest problems in this game was how hard it is to make money.  One of the hints I was given at some point consisted of doing tasks for people, which would have been all well and good, if it weren't for the fact that pretty much every single task required some sort of payment up front.  Occasionally, you'll get a somewhat sizable-seeming sum, but since everything is so expensive, it'll probably be gone very quickly.  Eventually, I ended up trying to gather and sell all the herbs and fish I could, but none of that stuff ever respawns, as it turns out; once you gather all the herbs and fish at all the fishing spots, it's gone forever.  So if you need that stuff later, as I did, you'll be buying them from the store.When I say I recommend this game, bear in mind that I only recommend it if you can get it for two bucks or less.  This is one of those ""I have less than five bucks left in my Steam wallet, what do I do with it?"" sort of game, not the kind of thing you should go out of your way to buy."

There is something very minimalist about the user interface and moving about the world that I quickly found rather appealing, though. The game is very well balanced in how you gain new skills, the things you can find, the quests you can solve, and though not strictly speaking linear, there is a rough order in which things need to be done.There was something refreshing in how you move through the world not as a fully-fleshed 3D or even 2D character, but by clicking on the buildings, people and items you wish to interact with, clicking on direction arrows on the edges of an area to move instantly to the next one. For adventure games requiring a bit of walking back and forth, and strange as it was to start with, this makes it less boring as many other games as there is no transit time to speak of to get around.It makes for a nice game in between other more time-consuming games. With a playthrough time of 3-4 hours if you wish to do everything you can, find all you can, craft all you can, hunt all you can - not strictly speaking necessary, but there is something satisfying about making as much money as possible too.The story is fine, the hidden-object aspect of the game for finding treasure, mushrooms, eggs, etc is nicely done, and even the unconventional combat system, if you can call it that, where you gather the resources you need to win a given battle and return to the location of it with the weapons, manpower and potions needed to overcome the enemy is an interesting and refreshing twist on what you'd expect to see in a game like this.I think I bought this very cheaply in a bundle, but even at its regular price, I'd still feel I got a few hours of entertaining gameplay's worth for my money, and cheaper than spending a similar time in the cinema, which is how I often calculate entertainment value when it comes to computer games."

The gameplay wasn't at all what I was expecting, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  This turned out to be one of my favorite casual games in years.  The gameplay consists mostly of resource trading in the guise of quests, along with a very enjoyable hidden object aspect.  Both are really well executed, too.-Very relaxing to play-Outstanding music-Despite having no real challenge to overcome, completing quests and finding things somehow gives just as much a sense of accomplishment as it does in a full fledged RPG-100% frustration-free without feeling like it's holding your hand (at least after you finish the tutorial scenes)-The hidden object aspect is really well done.  Objects are tough to find despite technically being in plain sight.-Have you ever added a task to you to-do list after already completing it, just for the satisfaction of being able to cross it off?

The fact it is extremely linear with very few options in terms of how you complete a quest only exacerbates matters. Either you harvest certain supplies you need, or outright buy them. I expect a certain simplicity with casual games like this, but this seemed to be a bit much in that regard. The story is very minimalistic with writing on par with a young children's story--just enough to make a point. It has very pleasing visuals and sound and the game length felt just about right from a completionist viewpoint.That said, this is a game that would be delightful to play with children. The simple story, hidden-object elements, and resource management just feel like it targets more of a family video-game night and I am reminded of old adventure classics like Mixed Up Mother Goose I would play with my parents and friends when I was young.Other players looking for a light, relaxing gaming experience can just sit down and enjoy the story without any pressures or puzzling to do however, players wanting a game that provides a more thoughtful experience may end up disappointed."

At this point in the game the tutorial starts to let you do your own things. After a while the farm gets burned down by a bandit. This leaves you with no home, no tools and just a little bit of money and food. You decide to seek shelter elsewhere and leave the burned down farm. This is the beginning of your journey on which you will become the Hero of the Kingdom. Fishing, hunting and gathering your way to riches to enlist the help of hunters, knights, scouts and wizards to find your father.More technical aspects:The HUD layout is quite astethically satisfying and completely out of the way. Which is to be expected with this kind of game. I like the artwork as it leaves a lot to the imagination while simultaneously indicating what a 'creature' or character you should be imagining but not completely showing you how it looks. In short, it looks dated and a bit like Anno 1602 in some respects.Audio wise the reminder of Anno is the same. It gives a nice atmosphere and it really helped to draw me into the story.I have had several minutes of pleasure laughing at the rediculous quality of the cow's moo.My experience:I normally avoid p&c games because it is not as action packed as I like my games to be. However, the description of Hero of the Kingdom really drew me in. Seeing it was on sale for only 60 eurocents I decided to buy it and was pleasantly surprised. The story progresses well and it kind of saddened me that it was over so fast. I played for roughly two to three hours to complete the story, the last hour or two were to complete all challenges as I am quite the completionist if my mind is to it. I personally would love there to be a much bigger map and a lot more to do as it seemed to be very possible to do so and would potentially greatly improve the game. Maybe with another big questline.Pro tip:You can make an infinite amount of money by buying grain from the farm, taking that to the mill and, at the with 5 coins, creating flour. Then going back to the farm to turn it into bread and selling that to the lady in the ravine, for a hefty profit of 240 coins for every 10 bags of grain you buy.[i/]Pro'sIt will run at 1000 fps on my potato of a computerA good storyAchievements!ConsIt's very shortIt's quite linear (duh)EvaluationDo I believe this game is worth the full six euro's?

,Recommended,259550,26611459,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,TiamosLoren,"So this was a quirky little game I've had my eyes on for a while. Having picked it up on offer, I decided to give it a run-through, and it was a generally pleasant experience. Nothing that stands out in particular in terms of what would set it apart from other games, but nothing that felt like it hampered my experiences either. If you have a few hours to spare and a bit of change, this is worth at least one playthrough to pass the time away. It doesn't have much of worth to bring you back for a second playthrough, but given a reasonable price point and it's worth the one time.The game is essentially a resource management simulation where you have to manage what you have, your energy, money and your skills to eventually become the ""Hero of the Kingdom"", and honestly, it's not too challenging provided that methodical progression is applied to everything, from levelling your capabilities to ensuring you have enough food or money for the next event you have to overcome. It does have some strategical layer of depth to it (case in point, you can simply buy certain things you need, but if you work on your skills you can get items for much cheaper than you would buying them) and I appreciated the layers that had been taken to reward those who did go a little extra in managing their resources more efficientlyA lot of the gameplay elements are easily visible event points, though one of the other draws of the game is an element of hidden object games, where you find items such as mushrooms or crates for extra items and money. Beyond these elements, it tends to play forward in a more point-and-click adventure game than your typical RPG (a great number of RPG elements are not present here, so if you are looking for an RPG experience, I would advise seeking this elsewhere) and the story it does tell through the story is a simple one, with a neat bow finish after the ending progresses. If any complaint could be thought of, it would be that there's no real sense of time passing by as any of these events transpire - and given that you can rest in camps without any effect to the story does not help in this regard.In terms of the art assets, the landscapes, the various icons and the people you get to see are pleasant to look at, with nothing looking out of the ordinary for a fantasy adventure. The game has a good sound quality to it, from the effects to the music, though it can sometimes be distracting when the track suddenly changes while you've been on a screen for a while without any change. All-in-all, though, the complaints that I have are minor and nit-picky, and did not detract from the fact that I did get enjoyment from the game overall, and while I clocked only about 4-5 hours and obtained all achievements (with others completing it in less time), it was a worthwhile 4-5 hours that I had spent without any regrets.In summary: While a short point-and-click adventure experience, it's hidden object and resource management elements helped keep the gameplay varied and entertaining, while the story and progression was balanced enough that it did not feel like it carried on for too long or too short a time, and it didn't leave any loose ends. It's lack of difficulty or replay value is an appeal for anyone seeking something to plug into for a few hours of their time, and the price value makes this at least worth a purchase on a sale, if not at full price."

But my worries dissipated after the game and quests opened up wide to allow some interesting decision-making. It was just the right level of challenge to complete all of the achievements. The story, although not very original or believable, is imersive and entertaining.I see people complaining about 2 things and I'd like to adress them.1 - ""It's like a facebook game"". People say that because of the energy system and kind of exploration + completing quests gameplay. Yes, the gameplay is really an interactive story with exploration, hidden objects, collection and trading, so be aware. On the other hand, it does not have those annoying time limits, inviting friends and premium currency. You don't even have to wait for your energy to be low to recharge it - there's no limit to how much energy you can carry so although it's not realistic, you can rest repeatedly and build up lots of energy to then do your actions. Also, this game has an END. It does not have seasonal events and added content. So I see a monstruous gap between this game and a facebook one, I love this game and hate the ones on facebook. Huge difference.2 - ""The game is too short"". For the people who say that, I recommend a youtube video called ""in defense of short games"", from the channel Extra Credits. They explain it a lot better than I could write here. But basically if people keep on judging games only by the lenght of the gameplay, we will get longer games that provides us a poorer experience. Everybody knows at least one TV series of movie franchise that got streched to the point it became so bad it was not worth watching. We need to end this way of thinking. The lenght was perfectly fine for me. I finished the game in 2 sittings of about 3 hous each, reading every dialogue line and getting all achievements before ending the game. Isn't that enough gameplay? There are too many other games out there I'd like to experience before getting stuck with a single game that provides ""endless gameplay"" or something.If I had to complain about one thing in the game, would be the pace of the action resolution sequences. Everytime an item drops, I need to collect it before moving on. Everytime I choose to perform an action, I need to wait until it is done to do something else. I'd like to be able to do several actions at once, clicking the next one before the previous one is completed, then collect their rewards. Or at least click several actions and ""queue"" them. It would make the game more dynamic. Also, the nighttime sequence is too long for something that will be repeated several times during the game.9/10"

After you learn a new skill, you can revisit earlier areas and apply skills and new knowledge there (in fact this is encouraged, if not too overtly), meaning that the at first seemingly linear story-telling fleshes itself out with gameplay that can broaden the depth of what you want to do in game, in a rather appealing way - it is not challenging, by any stretch, but it does require a modicum of thought, and, in my opinion, rewards people who like to get everything out of this kind of game."

It has nice oldschool graphics, with the feeling from the strategy medieval games from the 90s. It tries to simulate an RPG where you follow a story with your character and do a lot of fighting and tasks, but essentially you are just trying to find hidden stuff in the maps, or find your way through the dozens of maps that keep opening up, doing tasks like building, harvesting and helping people out.This is a game to play when you need to relax, because there ain't no thought envolved besides finding you way and what to do next. I don't think it is possible to ""fail"" in this game, unless you really try to, so everyone will probably finish it in no time. It is a short game.OCD people will have plenty of fun completing tasks, unlocking achievements and progressing, this is what this game is all about. I bought it during a sale and I can recommend it for low prices, otherwise, buy it  if you are a fan of casual games or are desperate for a feel of the 90s, but keep in mind the game is simple and short so most people will prefer to pay pocket change for it."

Get it on big discount only.The setting is a fantasy kingdom, and you are a young farmer who's trying to figure out what happend to your father. There are bandits, wild animals, and other tasks. Clickable locations on the map are marked, indicating things like places for resource  gathering (fish, animals, etc). A good part of the game is finding hidden resources, represented by tiny icons (like a hidden object game). There are no logic puzzles, timed puzzles, or random combat. The story is cliche', about what a child would write for a creative writing assignment.The rest of the game is resource management. You have health and money. Strenuous tasks cost health, which you can replenish by resting and consuming food. You can buy and sell items are certian locations. In order to complete certain tasks (including battles) you need specific amounts of items. All the needed items are spelled out for you when the task becomes available, so that you spend the next bit of game play trying to come up with the right mix of items to complete the task. Getting this right mix of items is where the resource management comes in. You spend quite a bit of time finding raw items (such as by hunting, fishing, or gathering herbs) and converting them into finished items or money. As your characer gains experience, more items are able to be found.The whole thing could either be a game teaching young children about resource management games (with lots of hidden objects) or a game for weary adults needing a mental break. About the first 15 minutes of gameplay is very straight forward, as you have everything to complete them and are just clicking through, but soon you come to tasks that require you to do some resource management, above.Once you finishe the game, you can go for 100% achievements, but the pixel hunting to collect all the eggs/crates/mushrooms is not easy.This game is cheap and periodically goes on heavy discount. I got it for $0.50, if I sell all the cards it'll be cheaper. It's maybe 4 hours of very low brainpower investment, and thus a very good value/cost ratio. I'm certainly going to investigate the sequel on the store page (but I'll only get it on 50% or better discount)."

It's somewhat rigid in storyline, but still fun.Also, very reliable on my old iMac.Not a huge amount of replayability once you've completed it, hope they add some DLC."
