76561198117015336,Not Recommended,259600,8076761,"Posted: 16 December, 2013",all,inku,"Finding Teddy is a great cute little game, unfortunately a slew of glitches and poor design decisions makes me caution purchasing this game (ah, for want of a better scoring grade!)The good: The art in this game is beautiful and atmospheric, both when it comes to backgrounds and to characters. There is little in the way of dialogue, but well-directed cutscenes do a great job of telling the (admittedly rather simple) story line. The protagonist is a girl looking for her kidnapped teddy in a strange dreamscape of monsters and spiders (arachnophobes beware). She comes across as very competent, and the game never overly sexualizes her or belittles her for being a girl, which is a huge plus for me. If I had kids I could definitely see myself playing this game with them.The bad: The game is short, many of the high points are already given away in the trailer. Interface is somewhat lacking and difficult to navigate. New game+ switches to old art in animations. More damning, there being no option to save means it is easy to get stuck at some places in the game by advancing before solving puzzles vital to finishing the game. The inability to travel back to previous levels again means you can get stuck and be forced to replay the game from the start. This game requires a very good ear for pitch as most puzzles contains a step (or several) in which you must echo a sequence of high-pitched notes. This is a great gameplay element, but if you have less of an ear for music this game becomes a lot less enjoyable (this was the case for me) -- something that could easily be mitigated by giving players the option to show the letter-notes in every puzzle, and in any case ought to be better advertised before purchase. For the most part the music is great, but the high-pitched tunes can sometimes become a bit hard on your ear, which is a problem since the sound is too important to the solving of puzzles for turning the sound off for a bit to rest your ears to be an option.In sum, this is a beautiful but short game with some innovative gameplay thet should have seen more work on the bugs and bottlenecks I mentioned above. I look forward to more games from this studio when they've found their proper sea legs."

The game plonks you down in the world and gives you next to no prompting as to what your meant to do. There are points in this game that there is no shame at referring to a walkthrough (in chapter 2 there are two puzzles in the same area that will require you to do things that you have never done before without any form of clue). Also I did encounter a glitch in chapter 3 (the wall runes puzzle) which required me to have to repeatedly enter the solution many times as it would not register that the sequence had been added.Negatives aside I did enjoy my time with this game. Would I recomend it?.. Errrrrrrrrr.......Well...First, I would not pay the full price for it. Get it on a sale. If you are really into point & click adventures then I would say it is worth checking out. Unintuitive as it is it really does get easier as the game progresses and you get the hang of the logic (with a few notable exceptions that I have mentioned).Second, if you are not a point & click adventure game fan or are new to the genre then this is not the game for you. There are points that are hair pullingly frustrating and it really does not throw you many bones as to what you should be doing.All in all, yes. If its on sale and your a fan of the genre get it."

I already started  over once when I learned there's fireflies you're supposed to catch, but there's no way of reloading old saves to go back for them. The final straw was meeting the final boss, but not having all the keys mapped out with, again, NO WAY of going back to get them.I don't know how someone could get through this without a walkthrough. I spent most of the time guessing which keys to press solely by experimentation and running back and forth. Clearer instructions and a manual save device would improve the game immensely."

,Not Recommended,259600,16315014,"Posted: 11 June, 2015",all,Usandru,"Finding Teddy is a mercifully short, deeply mediocre game with no idea what it is doing, backed by a very strong aesthetic that makes its numerous faults more or less tolerable for the scant one and a half hour it takes to play through it as long as you don't kid yourself and get a walkthrough immediately.The game begins with the titular Teddy being taken away by some manner of monster in the unnamed girl's closet. Thus begins the quest to retrieve the stuffed toy and immediately problems with both the narrative and gameplay present themselves.From the moment controls are handed over to the player, nothing whatsoever is explained. Some random clicking around the screen will likely reveal the basic controls, and soon thereafter the deeply uninspired, vapid point-and-click gameplay becomes apparent. The rest of the game consists of finding the single thing in a screen which matters to the rest of the game and using the correct item collected from a previous screen to interact with it. Intermittently, sound puzzles present themselves and do as such things usually do, cause progress to grind to an absolute halt.Now in and of itself, the point-and-click gameplay isn't horrid, however it has several major flaws that pushes it from mildly obnoxious to outright annoying. It has no comprehension of ""quality of life"" improvements to gameplay, such as minimizing backtracking, the puzzles are more or less all either blindingly obvious or painfully obtuse, and the controls are minimal and surprisingly annoying.Even this could have been but a stumbling block, older games have certainly had all these problems and worse besides. However to compound all this, the story - such as it is - is frankly not even remotely as clever as it seemingly likes to think it is.It consists of essentially five segments, of which only three are actually relevant to the ""story"", and of those, one is the introduction, and the other is the very final scene. Of the meat of the game, two of three ""chapters"" are essentially completely pointless. They add nothing, not even contributing in any real sense to an ""Alice in Wonderland"" atmosphere, because the insipid puzzles and the half-random, incoherent design ruin any such attempts. The attempt at purely environmental storytelling is in a sense admirable, but that still requires there to be an actual story! You cannot simply string together elements and pretend it makes sense!Additionally, the finale completely breaks with its own thematics and mood. The aesthetics and the progression through the environments had a steady darkening of tone, and the brutal deaths the unnamed protagonist might suffer during the game imply that the otherworld she travels through is a fundamentally hostile and dangerous place inhabited by enigmatic and unnatural creatures that make no attempts to communicate. Yet the final puzzle has more in common with a quaint children's picturebook than what the game was seemingly trying to be.The only verdict I can give is that the developers had no idea what they were actually trying to do, with their complete failure to understand how narrative structure and adventure game mechanics should actually work.Still. While incredibly flawed, it is not a bad purchase if the price is hanging around a single euro. If nothing else, the art itself is rather well done."

I cannot question the artistical capabilites of the developer, as the game has a consistently pretty artwork and consistently creepy atmosphere, but apart from that, there is nothing left in Finding Terry. The choice of a point & click was in my opinion a grave mistake; if this would have been a simple platformer it would have been infinitely better. The control with the mouse feels horrible: if you accidentally tell your little girl to go to the next screen, she will (slowly) go and you cannot cancel it. Sometimes you need to click behind the little girl and you'll not be able to (you'll need to leave and re-enter the screen). Althought you'll need to collect objects throughout the game, sometimes you cannot even tell what heck they are, and in the end it is just a matter of trial and error. Finally, the game is particularly short.Achievements are natural and relatively easy, with enough attention you can get them all without guides. The Linux port was okay, but I couldn't play on fullscreen - was it only me or is it general?Some of the puzzles were good enoughthe conversation with the Tarant, for instancebut I don't think it makes up for the flaws. The game felt to me like an artist's first contact with game development. If this would be a pixel arts project I'd thumb it up, but it is not. Definitely not worth the current price of 6,99€."

It's a basic point and click game, but there are options which you can click which *gulp* actually kill you!There is a puzzle aspect to this game, where you have to sing to some of the creatures as the items you have collected don't help you interact with them. I found it very difficult as I wasn't sure what the singing was about, but they are actually the 26 letters of the alphabet. Some of the ""songs"" are words spelt out using the musical notes, which can get a bit frustrating if you aren't sure which is which. With a bit of patience you can work them out, and then press them in the right order. It sounds tedious, but I actually like this aspect of the game, it brought a bit more thinking into it rather than just giving people items you've found to solve the puzzles. Let's face it, just picking up stuff and giving them to people can get a bit boring after a while. At least this gave it a bit more bite.Overall, really loved it and would recommend it to anyone who wants a pixel-y point and click but with a bit more brainwork involved.Would not recommend if you have Arachnophobia."

Finding Teddy is certainly not textless. The game begins with anincredibly simple item interface, boiling everything down to singleiOSclicks. Because of how paired-down the interface is, solving puzzles is painfully easy since one never happens upon enough items and roadblocks to have to even consider the question posed. Its cute graphics and simple puzzles could make the game work for a younger player, but the game shortly introduces a system of musical notes. A player must be able toidentify different notes(inconsistently)by ear or symbol.A brief analysis of the notes shows that they represent the English alphabet and are used tospell words.  This would make the game decidedly unfit to a player unable to read.The hardest part of the game is locating unnecessaryhidden objectsthroughout, that are never once referenced within the game and are only used to unlock concept art. Even then if a player knows how to look for them it is more a matter of trial and error than an invigorating exercise.While cute, it is hard to recommend the game. It is too easy for anyone who could manage its music system and too hard for anyone who is too young to be able to."

On one hand it is very pretty, sounds good, does its job fine, has a nice little message, it is short and sweet and it kind of clever for such a small development time. On the other hand it is kind of unforgiving for anyone without any musical knowledge. But even if it kept the visual aid the whole time, it still kind of falls on the trope of trying everything with everything else that most point and click games have; and it becomes kind of impossible without a guide.Well, if it is your cup of tea go for it."

Finding Teddy is a  simple point and click game involving some puzzle solving.  To be honest, I had to play this game using the walkthrough for the first half, as nothing is really explained  gameplay wise throughout the game. (I guess it's to add to the challenge, idk). Once you get the hang of the notes and type of puzzles, it becomes easier. It's a great little game to play casually and doesn't require too much of your time (or effort, depending if you use the walkthrough or not).

It's a point-and-click adventure, it's about the same length (just a couple of hours) and it has an amazing artstyle (even though Sword & Sworcery is just a tad more detailed). It's nicely animated, has a cute story and an unique way of solving puzzles, which rely mostly on sound. So you need a good ear to figure out how to imitate some of the tunes in it. After a while you'll figure out that the musical puzzles use a certain system. Once you figured that out the game will become a whole lot easier, believe me. I was impressed by the fact that the game was created in just a few months time. I have deep respect for that, because it's a polished game as far as I can tell.Supposedly, there's also a New Game+, which should (could ?) give you a different ending and allows you to use a colored girl (instead of black and white) or use a mask that allows you find the fireflies hidden around the levels.

In order to get it back she enters a strange world through her closet.First of all: It is quite a short game. Don't expect to be occupied or entertained for hours.Also the amount of information you get is very limited (if any), you gotta figure out a lot by yourself (there's no text speech or something).The variety of actions you can make is also limited: You can run from one end or object to another, collect a few relevant objects and solve puzzles mostly by singing ""songs"" of this strange world (I don't spoil but let's just say that the music notes look quite familiar). Personally I think the music idea is very original and sweet.The story is as simple as it gets (I already told it). And as you progress the story won't really develope. So it's more about exploring places and enjoying the atmospheric environment.The pixel graphic is very nice to look at, often very colourful and pretty.The soundtrack does not contain sound effects, it only builds on music which gives the game a special touch.Overall: I recommend the game because it was a nice short experience but I won't scream ""Play it!"" in your face. If you enjoy adventures where you get much more to do and don't like it otherwise, then ""Finding Teddy"" might not be something for you.Right now, the normal price is 6,99 € but I recommend to wait for an opportunity to save money (like through a discount offer or something).And when the announced sequel will be published, personally I'd like to check that out, too."

It’s Too Obtuse To Be Fun.Genre: 2D Point & Click Puzzle Game.Developed & Published by: Storybird & LookAtMyGame, Plug In Digital.Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay ThoughtsFinding Teddy is a simple point-and-click game from a new developer. Featuring a 2D plane with rich pixelart and a musically inclined themesimilar to a previous game that I’ve reviewed. Your teddy bear has been stolen so you’re going through another world, trying to get him back. That’s pretty much it, there really isn’t much to the story and the other “characters” don’t do or say anything of significance. I know they intentionally wanted to craft a game without dialogue, but there’s a lack of narrative that I can’t ignore.The main mechanic is a lot of simple inventory puzzles. Find an item, give it a creature/thing for another item and keep going until you reach the end of the level. All the while, you’re being sung to by creatures and walls. Which you’re supposed to figure out that the notes are actually letters from the english alphabet. But the game doesn’t really clue you in and the notes look so alien that I didn’t figure it out until a guide clued me in. Even if I was willing to let go of this complaint, it’s not that fun a mechanic. It’s more annoying as you try to match the notes in the right order to progress through the game but there’s a lack of feedback as to whether you’re doing it correctly.Far too many of the puzzles are too obtuse to figure out, with clues too far and few between. There’s no real hint to what each item does and I had to use a guide to get through at least 50% of the game. I’m not the greatest puzzler on the earth but even for me that’s pretty bad. While I can’t fault a game for my incompetency, the obtuseness of the game with the rather meager puzzles and story can be faulted.PC Settings (Or lack thereof)There is exactly one thing you can change in Finding Teddy: fullscreen on or off. Nothing else can be changed. There aren’t any .ini files that I could find either. It did run well during my playthrough but for such a short game, I do kinda expect that to be the case.Soundtrack is simply ok, not all that interesting or engaging to listen to. There’s also the other issue that the sound effects are too quiet over the louder soundtrack. Which would be easily solved if audio sliders had been put in but well, that didn’t happen. Even more odd is that there’s a lack of audio feedback. When you click on objects or move around, there’s nothing to really back up that you did that. It bothered me the entire while during my playthrough.Final ThoughtsFor a scant couple of hours, Finding Teddy is merely ok, not all that special. The lack of audio-feedback, the obtuse UI and puzzle design can be far more aggravating than I think it’s worth. I’m sure for the devs it was a great starting point and it’s got lovely pixelart to look at. But I just didn’t really enjoy myself with it, not helped by the constant need to refer to a guide in order to finish the game. All that combined with a minimal story and I'm finding it difficult to recommend Finding Teddy.Read this review on A Paladin Without A Crusade"
,Recommended,259600,34788580,Posted: 6 September,all,Cyril,"A short and pretty stylized adventure game. The visual design is probably the most interesting aspect, it's a pixilated style that's both a little blocky and still rather lush and vibrant and it's pleasant to look at. The soundtrack is fairly atmospheric and can be a bit unsettling at times.And the game has its unique sound-based puzzles though I can imagine those being tricky for people who are tone deaf. The puzzles as a whole aren't too tough and the game is less than two hours long in total but it's enjoyable enough to play.Complaints would be that the third chapter is a bit weaker than the others - the visual design of the area is much blander, there's a lot more open space, and you can miss solving a puzzle that is then all but needed to clear the final puzzle (I ended up having to use a walkthrough to clear the last puzzle as a result, but otherwise had no trouble clearing the game). But that's mostly nitpicks and yeah it's fine as a whole.For a low price I can see this buying you a few hours of entertainment, I mostly only got this bundled with the sequel game and basically played it out of obligation but it's still enjoyable enough on its own."

Many of the puzzles require an English alphabet to music code. It can be extremely frustrating if you don't know that the sounds relate to the alphabet or if you can't tell many similarly sounding notes apart. I do not recommend this game to anyone with audial difficulties.That said, this game is a cute, magical adventure full of death. It has the usual pitfalls of point and click adventure games - repetition, back-tracking, ""why do I have this object?"", use everything with everything, etc. - but it also has frustrating sound puzzles.

When she follows after the teddy bear, she is transported to a fantastical world filled with musically-inspired puzzles and several animal companions that can be used to solve riddles and unlock secrets.The majority of Finding Teddy's puzzles can either be solved by gathering and using the correct objects from within the level or by playing a specific melody on an alphabetical musical scale that the player slowly fills out throughout the game. The puzzles are thought-provoking without being aggravating. Often your goal is to find a particular item that will cause a creature that is blocking your path to move out of your way. As you progress further into the game, the little girl will be joined by two helpful sidekicks that will allow the player to reach otherwise inaccessible objects and areas.One of Finding Teddy's most charming features is its naivety; the game never presents you with a problem that must be solved via an act of mean-spirited trickery, but instead offers you sad creatures whose problems you must solve in order to continue. In Finding Teddy, you'll find missing baby spiders, sing ""Hello!"" to a group of frogs, and retrieve food for globular monsters with gigantic tongues. Finding Teddy is very much a game that embraces the perspective of the little girl that you play.Finding Teddy's high points can be found in its disarmingly childish storyline, its lush and detailed pixelized backgrounds and characters, and its attractively dialogue-free, music-centered gameplay. Perhaps the only downside to this casual point and click game is its short gameplay time and low replay value—most players will finish their first playthrough in under two hours and completionists with quick minds will find themselves completing all of Finding Teddy's achievements in that same time frame.Despite its short gameplay time, Finding Teddy is a brilliant example of quirky point and click games. This game presents you with sympathetic characters, unique puzzles, and a wonderfully vibrant atmosphere, giving it more than enough reason to earn a recommendation as a casual, light-hearted point and click game to play between some of your more intense adventures as a gamer."

The note system will throw you for a loop at first, because everything in this game is explained only to the slightest degree, which I understand can be frustrating, but understanding that you have to match words/notes to figure out words, remember the words so that you can use them when the time is right, and knowing that your items menu is pulled up just by clicking on her is really all there is that may be confusing to understand at first.Honestly, best game I have played in a while. 10/10, absolutely enchanting."

The mouse clicking is actually touch screen ""emulation"" and is very, very inaccurate and causes problems.  I click on the fly and due to the touch screen ""ripple"" it also selects the cat or the inventory or makes me leave the area.  I click on notes and it clicks through the notes onto actions to walk to things which kill you instead or it will click two notes at once which is never what you want and is completely useless.I completed the game only having to look up the answer two things at the very end.  One of which was due what I think is a miistake or oversight in the game.  The big spider is the GREAT TARANT.  His mailbox says TARANT, he is referred to as TARANT in at least two or three places.  But, for some reason the yellow glowing lantern puzzle makes you type his name as TARRANT -- extra R.  This made me stuck.  I get that if you concatenate all the wall scribbles you get GRE  EAT  TAR  RANT, but IMO it's still an awful oversight by the devs.  Unless I am missing something...The other thing I looked up was the response to ""I AM SAD"" beause the resonse to that was something the player would have learned at the very very beginning of the game before the player knows how anything even works.  In the beginning, there is pretty much no tutorial and I was mindlessly matching scribbles that I didnt even know were letters at the beginning so I did not properly learn that response to that question.  There is pretty much no tutorial and expecting the player to remember a nugget of infromation from before they understood the game's mechanics is just wrong.Overall, a nicely styled good idea, but poorly designed mess of a game that should have stayed as a distraction on Andriod/iOS and not a Steam game."

I really like the memorization aspect about this game, as there is quite a bit of backtracking. The amount of backtracking reminds me of the amount you have to do in Chapter 7 of Paper Mario: TTYD, but the detail and beauty of this 8-bit looking game gets you past that aspect of the game. Colors are vibrant and the soundtracks are very calming and peaceful. The only thing I would say that I personally don't care much for is the controls. You can only use your mouse to click which direction the protangonist wants to go, so there's no freedom of using the typical ""WASD"" key combination for moving around the world. It's definitely something to get used to if you haven't played a game like this. It looks as though this mechanic is changed in the sequel, as the protagonist can run, jump, and fight, bearing a sword and sheild right from the beginning.Overall I would highly suggest picking up this game. The price is an amazing deal, in my opinion, for the amount of work that was put into this game."

You help a little girl, whose beloved stuffed animal was stolen out of her bed while you try to supress all those whimsical ""Awwww""s that might escape your mouth watching all that cuteness that's going on On-Screen. Beware though, that this game has some very nightmarish moments, even deathscenes (And yes, each one of those unlocks a Steam-Achievment ;))Besides an item-inventory the player can use some kind of musical language trying to communicate with various animals and insects, that she meets during her travel. The hardest part of this game is probably realizing how this communication works, as the tutorial for this is almost non-existant.The artwork and animation is well done, the music score is pleasant. All in all there a well done first Steam-Entry for the developers atLookAtMyGame. Apparently they are already working on a sequel (Not too happy about that, I would like to see them do other stuff as well).I recommend this game to those who enjoy a very shortwhiled adventure experience.

A giant spider from another world kidnaps a little girl's teddy bear as she sleeps.  Your mission is to help her get Teddy back.The game doesn't have any verbs or action icons for interacting with the world, thus making the interface pretty simple.  You can collect items and then use those items from your inventory with the environment.  There is no need to combine items  with each other via the inventory system.The characters that you speak to don't have any english dialogue, but they instead communicate through melodic sounds.  There are many puzzles that can be solved through brute force trial & error, but it's definitely worth the effort to discover the cypher to the creatures' musical language.The graphics are the old-school pixel graphics reminiscent of the point & click adventures published  back in the 90s.  The animations are fluid and beautiful to watch.  The music and sound only serve as ambient noise while you explore the world.  Unfortunately, you won't find any catchy theme music in this title.I highly recommend Finding Teddy and hope that the developer produces a sequel!"

It's not too hard to figure out most of the controls on your own despite the lack of instruction. There were only two things that troubled me. One being some of the puzzles did not have the answers I thought they might so they took a little fiddling. The second being I could not read the musical notes as letters for quite some time, I think because I was looking at them as a foreign language or more as musical notes since they were assosiated with music. Several of the letters had such similar designs making them easy to mix up as well. I adored all of the music and sound effects, although I accidentally muted the sound at one point which made me panicked since I could not solve the musical riddles without hearing them! The graphics were both adorable and gorgeous, the color choice overall was awe inspiring when paired with the music or ambience! Interacting with creatures that lashed out when approached unexpectedly only to find they all could be very nice if you were careful and kind. I loved the story through and through. The ending made me happy as can be, going so far as to bring me to tears for how lovely it truly was. It leaves me wanting more for how short it is, but I still would fully suggest purchasing it. Thank you so much for creating this lovely game!"

You don't just click to walk somewhere, you only move when transitioning screens or picking up items, and you can't cancel these actions. So if you accidentally click on a transitional hitbox while clicking around for one of the game's many hidden collectibles, you're stuck moving.The game also tells you nothing. I don't know what's with these types of games telling you nothing about their story and their mechanics but it works as well for this game as it did for Hyper Light Drifter (read: not very). Like that game, there's also a made-up language you have to learn. Mercifully it doesn't require a language course to master and is mostly based in regular alphebeticals, but it relies heavily on sound cues. So if you aren't good with sounds, you're not gonna have a fun time.The game is also far too short. Not in the good way either, the only reason I barely scraped the two hour mark was because the game was so hard to figure out and I played it a second time in New Game+. I'd recommend the far longer (and far superior) sequel in comparison to this, but for what it's worth it's a great game if you really want it."

The musical aspect paired with the writing attracted me, also as a learning tool for my 6-year old, which carried the game along nicely.

You can only walk to places where something's going to happen. So you're standing around a lot.Your character will die, sometimes rather violently. No eyes popping out of their sockets, but being impaled by a bee might scare a 3-year old.When the girl runs, she swings her right arm and right leg forward at the same time, left ones backwards, unlike how humans run.
