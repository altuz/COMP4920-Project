76561197971913841,Not Recommended,259620,7797158,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,Xenfall,"I would call ‘3079 – Block Action RPG,’ a ‘cult-classic’ even though it’s still fairly new.  The reason I say that is because I feel that you’re either going to love this game or hate it.  Personally, I could not get into it.  I restarted the game about 12 different times, each time seeing if I had ‘missed’ something or simply didn’t understand the concept.  However, even after 12 times, I continued to scratch my head – wondering about the many facets of this game.I really loved the music, it does a great job driving-home the ‘futuristic’ vibe of the game.  I also love the ‘mechanics’ to the game.  You progressively get better at skills in the game by doing them – don’t like your terrible aim with that rifle, then keep shooting at things (all the things!).  I also noticed that the game included skills such as ‘mining’ and ‘stealing,’ which is awesome!Though, I believe what ruined this game for me was the story and setting; I think that’s what made me restart the game so times, too.  The, seemingly, inconsistent size of the NPCs, the strange location of buildings (yes, I realize it’s a randomly generated world, but there needs to be some consistency for an RPG), and the way items are distributed to the player (randomly generated on the ground, just sitting there or sold by a vendor – very inconsistent).  I tried to discover the reason, but it didn’t appear to be laid out anywhere obvious to the player, no in-game ‘books’ to discover with clues, no conversation with NPCs to help get answers.  The world needs to be 'plausible,' (not to be confused with possible) and the developer has not achieved that.I feel that a video game has the same mark that books, movies, and television bear – these outlets have a very small window of opportunity to grab their audience, if they miss that window it’s gone.  For me, ‘3079 – Block Action RPG’ missed that opportunity, and I really wish it hadn’t."

Ultimately, there is enough of a cool game here for me to keep putting time into it.The games name is strange, don't worry about it.  Here's what jumps out:  Action RPG.  The game is an FPS action rpg.  It looks like an ASCII Minecraft, but has all the ARPG symptoms.XP grind?  GODDAMN RIGHT SON.  Your skills increase as you use them.  Pick some pockets dawg, raise that stat.Loot? Yo, the big guy over there wielding a sword with fangs that one shotted the NPC from your faction?  You take his life, you take his blade.""... But clizzy, this dudes sword SUCKS BALLS dewd!""  Yeah, it happens.  But you can sell that piece in almost any area.  Items scale with the enemies, who scale with the zone.  You're in a level 9 zone, the level 9 enemies drop level 9♥♥♥♥♥♥that usually be sellin' for a pretty penny even when they are booty butter.  This is awesome because....There's mad cool♥♥♥♥♥♥to loot in this game!  This is my favorite part:  your character can equip jet packs and grappling hooks that give you crazzzzzzzzy mobility.  You can fly into sky fortresses, or zip around the landscape with non-stop grapple shots.  Thing is, though, these ♥♥♥♥♥es also scale.  Level 1 hooks/packs can be used when holding 40 weight, no more.  Every level adds an additional 40 lbs.   It's cool zipping into a high level zone, on a mad hunt for the shopkeeper or drop zone with the clutch twink grappling hook/jet pack.  You have to get out alive too, because when you die you lose an item.  The game is sadistic, it will eliminate the item you hold most dear.I suppose I wish the game felt more complete.  I've put some goodly time into it and I'm not sure if there is anything else to do but loot grind.  The building mechanic?  No idea what's going on there.  Completely arbitrary, in my experience.However, I have to say that I haven't got many quests done in the *main* story line.  There's a little bit of RNG involved with quest givers having to give you a specific reward to advance - it can get a little frustrating.   Hunting for the right people always devolved into loot grinding and murdering things.  This was really fun for a bit, and I'll probably sit down a few more times to see just deep the game goes, but it becomes nothing more than pure carrot-sticking.   Still hours of fun.6.9/10"

Not only does the world feel organic and full of dangers, but there's solid gameplay utilizing the best parts of both the building of Minecraft and item-searching in dungeon-diving of rogue-likes.Also, it looks good 'n artsy. None of that Minecraft monotone but rather some creepy and original style to it. Randmization really makes stuff interesting in this game. There's definitely lots to see, meet and explore.As to the difficulty, it's the game's strong point. This world is relentless and does need you to take it seriously. You need to acquire skill first, then items in order to survive and advance in progress-indicating levels and power.But what I'm really looking forward to is what's in the future of the game. It does seem it could easily get some servers with communities similar to those of DayZ in order to make the game feel even more organic, purposeful and alive. Not to mention patches and mods.It's a world ever at war. And you need to shape it."

,Not Recommended,259620,11811609,"Posted: 21 August, 2014",all,Disheveled Possum,"3079 is similar to a combination of Borderlands and Minecraft, as its a very open world, with a very 'blocky' look. I was attracted to this game due to the Steam Reviews, which seemed to indicate a very unique game, with lots of replayability and exploration. I have played this game for about 4-5 hours, not the 7 minutes reported, due to the game not reporting to the Steam Client as it opens up in a Java window....Unfortunately, my experience has not been very good. Initially, the game would not run, and required 2-3 reinstallations from Steam to ensure it would open as expected. Once in the game, there is not a lot in the ways of a fluid or organic flow to the game. You sort of just walk around, hoping to figure out things as you go before you die. The monsters are not that exciting to look at, and the animations are very poor. I have attempted to play with a friend, and even then, the game was not any clearer.I would describe this game as a cult-classic type favorite, where you either LOVE the game, or you HATE/DON'T UNDERSTAND the game. Unfortunately for the developer, I easily fall into the ""Don't Understand"", and ""Don't Like"" side. Since the game is cheap I find it hard to give a bad review, but this game unfortunately goes into my 'Pile of Shame'.TLDR; not a great game, not well developed. very cult-like following, but was not able to enjoy."

,Not Recommended,259620,22637723,"Posted: 25 April, 2016",all,somebody336,"3079 is an Open World FPS set on an alien planet where you are sent in to stop a never ending war between two species. At least that's what you’re told to do but upon landing you instantly pick a side of the conflict and work as a mercenary for hire. The species friendly to you at the beginning are the humanoid looking aliens but you can switch sides by killing enough of them to please the other side. It may seem like a good idea to immediately head out of the city and hunt some aliens but as you will soon find out they are soldiers that only know war while you on the other hand are the space equivalent of some random dude running off to the battlefield with a Nerf gun. You will immediately realize how useless you are at fighting at the beginning and it is an important lesson to learn since dying means losing a random item. I say random but most of the times they seem to take away your grappling hook or your most used weapon.It is a really rough introduction to the game and even if you manage to knick a weapon off of an enemy killed by someone else you will not be able to use it. There is no ammo in this game, instead everything relies on your energy meter and the more powerful a weapon is, the more it uses. At first you may as well be carrying a broken gun as you will not be able to fire off a single round without it overdrawing your energy and harming your health. This game features skills like stealth, energy and charisma to name a few, which get more effective as you use them in a certain manner. Unfortunately the way to improve them are usually insanely tedious. You'd think that by using energy its stat will go up but the way it works in this game is that by using more energy than you have and harming your own health it will eventually increase. Since in the beginning you can barely fire off any rounds at all that means you will spend most of your early adventures staring at a wall and repeatedly firing just to get your energy up. Enemies regenerate health so by the time you have enough to fire again they will be mostly healed meaning you must use the better weapons with heavy energy usage.Honestly, this energy thing is what harms the game the most and will be a problem for the entire game as you need more and more energy. Stealing is pure RNG and requires you to get caught in order to increase its stats while being hit when you are camouflaged makes you better at Stealth. The progression system is a complete, nonsensical mess sadly and by that logic I'll become a mathematician by failing my math tests. Seems like a petty thing to complain about it but it is honestly no fun and means you only get better by either doing tedious things or getting shot in the face. The only thing you really get for killing enemies is their weapons to sell to a vendor later on. Vendors are the same as any other alien but with a ”$” symbol on their shirt. You could buy useful objects from them like grappling hooks, armor or generators that increase your stats while active. These generators can have some rather cool effects such as increasing your jump height enough to be able to jump houses and walls which makes you feel pretty awesome as you take down several enemies midair.You can tell any none busy ally to follow you around and gather up your own posse to hunt down the enemy if you so please. It is a really handy feature, especially early in the game when you are pathetically weak. The AI is not all that great so they are only useful in open fields, don't expect to be rescued while in buildings. AI is embarrassingly bad for the spacecraft that fight like if you had a giant magnet to your face and will stick right on you until one of you is dead. You can attempt to hijack which is a pretty cool feature and lets you zoom around the skies though it is rather weak and likely to get you killed if used in a fight. It's also a bad idea to go too far out as the further you go the stronger the enemies are. Along with the two species at war there are also demons that look like red gummy bears out to kill everything. These are a very annoying as they will pull you in near them no matter the distance between you two. They are not rare and it is not unusual that you have to fight with the controls just to escape their gravitational pull any time you want to go somewhere.Demons can only be killed by a very specific kind of sword which brings me with another issue. You can only equip 4 weapons or items to the hot-keys at any one time. The rest of your number keys are useless and you will always want to have the demon sword and grappling hook equipped so you only have two hotkeys to work with. This adds completely unnecessary micromanagement whenever you need something else like a satchel charge, your drill or your construction tool. You can mine the randomly generated world for gems though they offer very little money compared to simply scavenging guns from a battlefield. This game does feature destructible environments but only with the satchel charge unfortunately. Building your own base is possible but ultimately pointless as the point of the game is to move further and further out into the map while staying in a low level area is useless.Grappling hooks in this game are a ton of fun to use and have a pretty long range making you feel like a mix of Spider Man and Rambo as you quickly navigate the environments. There is an anti-gravity device that allows you to float around at the cost of not being able to recharge your energy. It is really useful for reaching the floating buildings and did lead to an insanely awesome moment where I was near death & surrounded at the edge of a cliff, jumped off and managed to activate it a few feet from the ground. 3079 does have its moments and incredible potential but seems to sabotage itself at every turn. Like the previously mentioned grappling hooks an anti-gravity device can only support a certain amount of weight from your inventory. It sounds reasonable enough but as you head to a higher level area which happens quite often, everything starts weighing more and more. That's not anything unusual in video games but it feels so artificial here where even the health packs start weight over 30 pounds. One area will have a grappling being sold with up to 400lbs usability and the next one will have one with 440lbs. You don't think “Wow, I can carry more now!” instead you're feel the need to facepalm as everything suddenly gets heavier in order to make your gear obsolete  time and time again.You receive missions from allies with stars on their chest but they are rarely worth the price. There are main missions that revolve around the fight against demons and you will need to do at least one of those to get yourself a demon slaying sword. At the end of the day 3079 implements a ton of ideas into one package but fails to make the overall product fun. As an example you turn on your night vision and grapple onto the top of a tall tree with a sniper rifle to take down some enemies. Multiple things keep this from being fun. For one your night vision goggles only pick up enemies of a certain level so you will have to keep buying new ones every time you enter another area until you can't be bothered. Second your sniper uses up a ton more energy while using the scope yet has no added damage, so you may as well use it without the scope which defeats the purpose of a sniper. And finally, it is not unlikely there will be a demon in sight that will cause you to fight with the controls just to keep your footing in the tree even if it is far away and unaware of you. 3079 has a ton of ideas and a ton of heart no doubt but I'm afraid its progression system, annoying mechanics and combat heavily hampered by energy make this a game I simply can't recommend."

Beyond that, if you want a good time waster this can be pretty good, but in the long run, its not gonna suit you for long. If you wanna give it a shot you can, but its not something to put a large amount of time in."

I'm an old gamer that has been around before PCs used DOS, and I still can't get over this game.  I got this game on sale this week at $0.49 and it is worth a whole lot more than that.I've been strafed by two planes at a time.  I've been fired upon by a Flying Fortress in the heat of multi-squad battles, exploded the Fortress with my AI buddies while it was doing a bombing run over us and it crashed into us with a huge explosion, forming a real time crater beneath us while doing so ... and lived.  Now, I don't know about you, but that's about as good as it gets.  Who needs a combat MMO when you can play this with AI and no internet connection?Do the game's graphics look a bit like something out of the Stone Age?  Sure.  But this game takes Combined Arms to the limit.  You were told there was a violent war going on, well they weren't kidding.   The whole terrain is littered with pits, craters, used by some as fox holes and others seem to be having moments of extreme war fatigue in them, and you'll join them soon enough.The first couple of hours you'll be wondering what the heck is this thing called 3079.  You'll feel like a poor rube who somehow got caught up with the resistance, but you don't even know what a war is.   When you land, night and day changeover quickly.  The nights even from the starting town, have not only the sounds of flak and gunfire in the distance, but you can actually see the tracers and explosions of vehicles and men out there beyond the town's fortified walls and above the tree tops.  And those tracers and explosions are the real deal, that's actually happening out there.  They are not canned ambience tracks or graphics for effect, it's the news come to life. Yep, this is one wild ride.  It may sometimes look like a throwback, but few games give you an experience like this of war.  You'll be confused, out-flanked, cowering in fear -- and then slowly but surely you'll get your bearings, start looking for battle and heading out to the action, using buildings and terrain as best you can.The game has things which annoy.  The lifts are easy to get momentarily stuck on, just back into them and adjust so your back is fully to the lift blocks and away from the edges and you'll be fine.  You'll be bumping into the roof on the highest level, but you'll figure that out.  The ""Demons"" in the game are a pain to deal with, pulling you towards them with some unknown telekinetic power and attacking everyone, friend or foe.  But once you get some Demon Smiting Swords via Quests, you will have a solution.  There are a few too many buttons and nothing is that well explained, but that's why I wrote a basic tips guide for newbies in the forums, in case the videos on the game, which are really terrible, don't get you over the hump.  You can also talk to npcs that aren't giving quests or aren't merchants for a random tip or two.Ever wanted to be an astronaut/soldier/special forces guy sent to investigate war on a planet and try and stop the war and bring peace?  Neither have I?  But that's what you are up to here, but good luck getting there in one piece. Do yourself a favor, on the launcher menus, choose Easy Mode, it's still exciting as heck, and you'll still die enough to learn to respect the game.  Also, up the FOV to 115 or so, in this game the camera positioning really needs it and you still we be caught broadside from your flanks easily enough.For those of you looking into this game, I've posted a basic starting guide to help on the forums.  I'll probably move it into the 3079 Guide section later on.All I can tell you is that most of the YouTube videos are made by people who have no idea of how to play a game and on early beta versions.  You can catch some of the early excitement, but good luck getting any tips on playing the game.  For example the following things said in some videos are wrong.  The game can't kill steal, you up your stats by overloading any action of that stat.  Test your limits to improve, it's not that confusing. So overload and empty your energy in your batteries, you may up your total energy.   Overload your inventory so that the weight is too high, barely walk that way and soon you get extra strength, and by soon I mean in a matter of 10s of seconds.  Think of overloading a skill as leveling and improving by necessity. The game is cool like that as it wants to promote the way you decide to play.I actually enjoy this game more, so far, that 3089, even though 3089 has more polish and a lot less seemingly irritating things in its GUI.  They are similar.  But the gravity of the situation in 3079 is a lot more tense, you are a lot more confused from the start, and combat is almost visceral in that weird alien way.  Just forget the graphics and experience what is going on, and you'll probably end up enjoying it as much as I do.  3079 is more raw and brutal than 3089 and on sale for $0.49 it's worth taking for a test drive.  Learn to survive, because if you think simple graphics makes for an easy game, you don't know Phroot.  To get past the initial confusion, however, is going to take at least 2 hours.  So, if you wish to be protected by the Steam Refund Policy, I suggest you read a basic guide and maybe look at a couple of videos before you play.  Or just buy it on sale next time and stomach the two bits you paid. If you can get past the graphics, you are in for one hell of a ride.On top of that, the game has night vision goggles, allows you to build fortifications, you can use a grappling gun to climb buildings, ride and jack into airplanes.  It has suspended flying cities in the atmosphere.  You can teleport, you can cast effects on your enemies or yourself using Transfer Effect guns.  You can capture towers via hacking the enemy computer in enemy towers if on a quest.  That's just what I've learned and experienced so far.  It has a ton of different weaponry, heavy guns, assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, explosives, grenade launchers, jeez.  All of them have the potential to have additional modifiers on them to stats.  A lot of them don't really make sense, since when you equip your weapon you can't mine for example, you need the mining tool on you, but still it's like Diablo 2 met Battlefield on a crucial Hill 49.Highly recommended, if you can get past the graphics and first 2 hours. If you can't get past the graphics, I recommend you take a look at 3089 and 5089.  Those games have a better user interface, much fewer irritating issues, and look better.  They are easier to get into since more info is available in game as tips and help.  It's not as wild a ride, but it covers the same type of gameplay.(This game runs fine on an Intel HD 2500 Integrated GPU.  So if you have that or later on a laptop, it should work.  I can't speak for the AMD Integrated Chips, it may work just as well.)"

So another similar-looking game isnt bad in my book.Now for the review.As I said, it looks like Minecraft. Its a procedurally generated 3d block game, where the world/items are different every single time. So big 3d blocks with texures, prodecurally generated huge maps.But thats where the similarities end. Its a space-RPG for starters. And all the quests and stuff are randomly generated, as far as the quest structure, it runs more like Daggerfall (without the horrid bugs). You meet a group of aliens, who give you random quests and rewards thereof. Enemies are ""demons"", really tought things that fly through the clouds. They are the main focus and plot of the game. There are also other alien races. You run around getting quests and items, fighting bad guys, and trying to stop the demon incursion. Simple, really.Its fun and totally worth 6-7$, especially if you like that style of graphics.I just keep on trying to mine thru walls when I see a room I want to get to though..."

,Recommended,259620,22191883,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,Al,"Playing this is both very enjoyable and incredibely frustrating. It's a somewhat difficult first person shooter with a bunch of RPG elements. Procedural generation and randomized aspects, such as algorithmic quests and unscripted faction battles that will certainly change the topography of the map, give the game a majestic feeling and some replay value. At that appraisal, I should have nothing but love for this game, but unfortunately it frequently dips into the realm of taking otherwise good ideas and implementing them in the most extreme, unenjoyable ways.For example, simply starting a new game is a matter of chance, as the starting equipment you receive may not match your play style, and it is very easy to die in the beginning of the game even with desirable inventory, often due to low-damage, low-accuracy weapons. Meanwhile, enemies get very accurate weapons that are often scaled far better than your own. 99% of better weapons can be found on dead enemies.If you survive your first several hours, you will discover that the difficulty and shop scaling is based on how far away you go from the initial spawn point. This makes some sense, to keep the player from constantly being bombarded by overpowered baddies, but it also turns the beaten paths into a tedious slog with little reason to ever backtrack, except maybe for a quest.The difficulty is the most noticeable problem, however. Apart from inaccurate guns, there is also the constant issue of rules that just don't apply to enemies, but do apply to the player. Enemies don't get hurt by their own explosions. Their ships never crash. Friendly fire is off for them.The biggest problem is the punishment for dying. Upon death, the player loses one random item, and this can absolutely cripple a character build if the item in question is particularly useful. For example, if I die and lose a powerful antigrav pack, which allows the player to fly, then replacing it with an equally strong pack requires a trip back to the intense enemy territory where can be found the only stores which sell items that useful. In the worst case I had, it was a 20 minute round trip. Long story short, the punishment for dying is really just that, punishment, not really fun or interesting at all. I did find a bit of a way to circumvent this, by filling my inventory with crap that I don't mind using, but, surprise surprise, I can't fly like that either.As much as I've complained about it here, this game is actually quite worth the money. It's addicting, and it provides a decent level of depth. There are the parts that make me want to tear my hair out, but that's balanced out by fun."

But from my experiences unless you are THE MOST CAREFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD you just get shredded! Even on easy that's right EASY I got teared apart by any enemy regardless what weapon they were using. It's fun the first minutes sure, but when the difficulty kicks in you are in trouble. I played this game once before it came to steam and i had one heck of a good time with it, but as with all games updates arrive and i found it more and more difficult to survive more than 5 minutes without having to run and gun or spam health packs. The quests in the game are good, but there is almost no variation to them at all. From what I've played i've done killing sprees, protection, hijacking, assassinations what else can I remember? Almost nothing as I don't see this game as memorable in the near future at all! The trading/byuing in the game is good though, but having to destroy crates and digging for gems to get a lot of money or just to earn a few extra credits just to be able to afford that one item that you see as life saving isn't worth it.Back to what I said about run and gun. This game has you either run from your enemy that quickly reach higher levels than what you might be prepared for, or it has you fight until you die in one spot with close to no help or followers that just die almost right away. Unless you're playing with friends it's almost impossible to win this game.In the game you have three bars, one health, one stamina and one that I have no idea what the hell it does. You also have strength which you can increase via melee weapons or carrying way more than what your character can handle, and then there charisma, thief and so on. Try just walking right in to a cluster of enemies with some friendlies mixed in there and look at your health bar, unless you're ignored that bar will go from max to minimum in less than 10 seconds. Stamina! Don't even bother!! If your weapon can't be used because you have to little stamina and you try to shoot it you lose health to slowly up your stamina. Want to find generators or batteries that increase your stamina? Good luck! Any good generators/batteries are a long way north, west, east or south! You also use stamina to power your jetpack(Game calls it ''Anti-gravity pack''), your night visors(NVG, Night vision, Night Vision Goggles whatever you prefer),  I do believe it's also used for your radar? Not sure about that, and also camoflage! Yeah camoflage! Good idea right? No... From my experience everyone can see you if you have it activated! Enemies or if you have accidentally attacked a friendly they all see you! Oh and friendly fire is more of a b**ch than gravity it self! And I forget what else it's used for, oh yeah! YOUR WEAPONS REQUIRE A LOT OF STAMINA!!!!!!! Assualt rifles and blasters not much but any other type (melee weapons don't count as they use 0 stamina for some reason) demands a lot of stamina! And as I said good luck finding any good generators or batteries!I do not reccomend this game if you were expecting good variety, easy challenges, good experience, good shooter or a good RPG system (something close to or similar to Mario RPG, Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger or something like that). Oh and it has a good open world system but it just doesn't have a lot of different terrain. It mostly consists of a few hills every now and then, mostly flat ground, oh hey a lake! every now and then otherwise the lakes are just what I call puddles, and a WAY to huge dessert that you get way too quickly lost in."

Example: I haven't beaten the first mission yet, (which I think is kill a demon king from the info I collected, I still don't know yet) because the game doesn't give me any feedback at all where to go, so I have to wander around the big world aimlessly until I find it.Pros:+Good Music+Good Gun System+Good GameplayCons:-No Explaination-Overdone Concept-Empty World-Bad MiniMapIt's Probably better with multiplayer if you can figure out how to work it, but I give this game a...5/10COULD'VE BEEN BETTER"

I'm sad to say unfortunately i wasn't particularly blown away, I got through to the end of the story, and I really wasn't interested in the game anymore. I didn't like the graphics, i felt they were just patchy and weird. I found the combat, maybe a little different because of the gun variety, but still to be a bit floaty and not so riveting.Don't get me wrong, i never really cared about negative things, since they aren't as bad in this game, i felt it just didn't have anything really positive. Its a mediocore game that was slightly dull and a few strange decisions within the art style and gameplay. I felt everything was very clunky and nothing was exciting to see or do. I found the building capture missions quite clever and the stealth system doesn't exactly suck, just as said before, not to exciting.I hope in the future the developers learn from their mistakes and make something more fun. I felt they tried to keep everyone happy and doing so dulling out their game.

Der Spieler strandet auf einem hart umkämpften Planeten, wo er den freundlichen Humoids in ihrem Krieg gegen die Neanders und böse Dämonen zur Seite steht, sowohl zu Lande, als auch in der Luft. Die auf Voxel basierende Grafik ist stark von Minecraft inspiriert und dementsprechend besteht die Landschaft aus Blöcken und ist extrem verpixelt. Ebenso können manche Blöcke zerstört und neue Blöcke oder auch Fahrstühle und bewaffnete Türme mit dem entsprechenden Werkzeug gesetzt werden, allerdings nur in begrenztem Maß, ist das Werkzeug aufgebraucht muss ein neues her. Das Spielprinzip erinnert stark an Titel wie Borderlands: Es gilt dutzende Items zu sammeln, darunter verschiedene Arten von Schilden, Medikits und Radars sowie diverse Arten von Waffen, wobei manche wie bei Borderlands durch zusätzliche Effekte entweder mehr Schaden austeilen oder dem Spieler z.B. durch schnellere Energieaufladung helfen. Auch das Levelsystem erinnert an Borderlands. Die Waffen verbrauchen keine Munition, sondern Energie. Je stärker die Waffe, desto mehr Energie wird pro Schuss verbraucht. Ist der Energiebalken leer, muss einen Moment gewartet werden, bis er sich ausreichend aufgeladen hat. Dem kann der Spieler durch das Sammeln und Aktivieren von Generatoren und Batterien entgegenkommen. Seine Aufträge erhält der Spieler von den sogenannten ""Leaders"" der Humoids, welche mit einem Stern markiert sind. Überschüssige Items können bei den mit einem Dollar-Zeichen markierten ""Merchants"" gegen Credits, die Spielwährung, verkauft werden. So findet man sich ratzfatz in einem absoluten Sammelwahn wieder, immer auf der Jagd nach noch besseren und schlagkräftigeren Items.FAZIT: Man erhält hier viel Spaß für wenig Geld und Festplattenplatz. Für Fans von Minecraft und (vorallem!) Borderlands ist dieser Titel definitiv einen Blick wert! Vorallem aber auch, weil es durch sein Oldschool-Spielprinzip und die verpixelte Grafik an die guten alten Zeiten erinnert, als ein Spieler nicht nur kurz in Deckung gehen musste, um sich zu erholen."

I think the negative reviews are a result of people not understanding what type of game this is, as someone else pointed out it's somewhat like doom meets daggerfall (purely in a genre way), the game isn't particularly doom-like, but it is a ""primitive"" fps with old school rpg elements. There is alot of content in this game despite it's small download size and the simplicity of the graphics of course.Overall I recommend this game if you like the genre and style, and want a game that isn't the typical multiplayer nonsense, or AAA bad game with good graphics waste of your time. It's a good way to kill a half hour, or ten or twenty minutes of your free time, and doesn't overdo itself, or take itself too seriously. I just bought another one of ""phr00t""'s games, because I like this one, and I hope you keep on making better games. I feel that this format and the developers game making style could potentially make the perfect old school rpg, or first person roguelike rpg..with a little work and improvement."

If you enjoy open ended games with tons of replayability you have found a great game.First off I just want to preface this review with saying that I am fascinated with procedural generation in games. The univerese is a unpredictable place with random chance occurrences happening everywhere. It is unpredictability which makes life so diverse and interesing.In this game all chatacters, weapons and the world itself are randomly or procedurally generated. This creates a unique experience everytime you play. It also creates hilarious moments where unexpected things happen.Procedural or random generation is a two sided sword. Because of the random generation, the game experience is not always balanced. Sometimes you will get your *ss handed to you by powerful enemies, sometimes you will find a item which gives you an enormous advantage. The random god giveth and the random god taketh away.I think a good way to judge a game is similar to judging good music. Does it make you experience emotion? In 3079 you will experience every emotion in the spectrum. Happiness when you take out a huge enemy capital ship or find a very good unique weapon. Anger when you see a demon hacking up your fellow humoids, Fear when a demon is pulling you in and you don't have a demon smiter sword and you are over your weight limit on your grappling hook, Exiliration as you fly from mountaintop to mountaintop with a combination of grappling hook and antigravity pack. Pride when you build a inpenetrable underground fortress or capture an enemy building and see your fellow humoids come to inhabit it.My suggestion is to not rush through the game and see how fast you can beat it but to take the time to learn the different styles of gameplay and explore the emmense world created for you.This game is very underated. Most of the bad reviews are from people don't have the patience to learn how to play. You have to be selective in choosing your gear in this game by paying attention to the stats as they vary dramatically. If you just run out into the world with out a strategy you will be slaughtered just like the people who give up after 20 minutes of playing on many of the let's play videos on youtube."
,Not Recommended,259620,11451600,"Posted: 28 July, 2014",all,White Rhino PSO,"Updated ReviewThe first time I played this game, it seemed interesting and quirky. I got some gear and a quest to bring an item to another NPC. To do so I had to shoot the NPC just so he'd come low enough for me to give him the item, as he was a flying guard. I should have known that this would be one of the less aggrivating parts of this game.I started a new game and played for about half an hour. During this time I died five times. I never completed a single quest, and so I made no progress whatsoever. I would explore the different buildings, breaking wooden crates to sell the material right back to the vendors in the same buildings. I would finally have enough to buy an item or two, or sometimes found items while exploring, but none of them seemed to make a difference.The quests I tried to complete are as follows.""Destroy the capital ship."" The small pistol I had bought seemed to have no effect until I got close enough for the ship to open fire on me and reduce me to a fine red paste.""Protect this Humoid for X seconds."" I made it over to the target fine, and things seemed to be all right. Until a hostile flying ship flew over and hammered him into the ground before I could even pull my weapon out. And then it killed me.""Kill X Neanders in X seconds."" This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't standing in the middle of the Humoid city, and there's no sprint mechanic. With a little abuse of the grapling hook, I was able to quickly hop the nearest wall and went to fight a Neander. This one, the only one in the area, happened to be considered a 'giant' and so was doing ridiculous damage to me. I had previously lost my pistol to a death, so all I had on me was my melee sword.The only time I maybe killed an enemy? When I was on one of the floating buildings, apparently owned by Neanders, and used stealth to hit a guy. The knockback tossing him off the edge of the platform; I have no idea if he actually died or not, because a shopkeeper in the same building quickly killed me again.I'm sure the game might be worth $6.99 to some people, but it's just too tough for me, and I played on the 'normal' difficulty. After the time spent to make zero progress today, though, I don't really see myself playing it again. All in all this game seems like an interesting idea, but it feels like the ideas they put forth - RPG elements, material harvesting and crafting, science fiction storyline - are all handled much better in other games."

(No, not really, nothing's as bad as that :P)To start, this game has graphical design of some really old game, like the original DOOM. It's 2011, why was it released like that? For a retro feeling? All it did was make everything look ugly! THe people look freakishly deformed, as the human generator just changes the design of the charaters by adjusting their BODY PART SIZES!You can die in so many ways, it's impossible to play. The Enemies bigger than you, logically, can step on you. But there's no warning of that, you just GET CLOSE AND THEY DAMAGE YOU! YOu can Hijack the incredibly OP fighters, only to find they're made of paper and explode if you GRAZE the ground. Enemy Fighter, though, are made out of Hardened Titanium, because they can ram into you, and never blow up! Capital ships can wreck you with one hit, Demons suck you in and you need a special sword to kill them, ect.Your guns? They use the incredibly stupid function of an ENERGY BAR in order to fire. This is absolutely the worst ammo Idea in history. You CANNOT CHANNEL YOUR SUIT BATTERY INTO A SEPARATE GUN THE MOMENT YOU PICK IT UP! This is one of the things that annoys me in Starbound, but at least THAT'S playable!Quests are annoying as well, there can only be ONE active quest at a time, and if you die ONCE, no matter what killed you, you lose the quest. Terrific. What tops it off is that you lose a random Item every time you die.The game's AI is terrible. If they're not swarming eachother, they are aimbotting their way to killing you. Diplomacy is out of the question, too, I haven't even figured out that!Building is useless, you won't play this game long enough to build a longterm building.The game is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it looks like some COllege student's project for class that he got a distribution license for. Don't buy this, the 7 bucks is NOT worth it."
