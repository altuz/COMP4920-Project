The story is quite interesting, although simple. The game is pretty confusing too. Lots of times it gives no clues as to what you have to do, and sometimes you have to do some pretty weird stuff, like hanging an amulet on a random statue, or pickpocketing a key without even being told you can pickpocket.  I am a huge fan of werewolf related stuff, which is why I bought this, but I was rather disappointed. Overall it isn´t terrible, but it feels a lot like a test or early access game, so with a few updates it could become pretty decent, since the main idea and settings are great."

First off, the map is horrible in the game. It doesn't tell you where you are, where you need to be, no hints, nothing. You stumble through the game with absolutely no direction or hints.I can overlook the horrible character models and cheesy dialogue, but the whole ""Stuck wandering around in hopes that i'll stumble on the right thing"" is a big turn off.*Edit* Sorry if my personal opinion of a game offended anyone. Although I shouldn't have to defend myself, I will. I'm not a ""noob"". I've been gaming since the original Mario Bros. and Zelda.Games usually tell you where you are on the map so that you have a general sense of your surroundings. No, I don't like things handed to me in a game, but some direction would be nice.I love trying new games and I love challenging games, however, this one just didn't do it for me. That is MY opinion which I am entitled to. If you don't like it, then skip over it and move the hell on with life. Don't bash someone just because they have a different opinion  (on a damn GAME I might add) than you."

BUT...this game is so new and poorly develped that it has so many glitches.these glitches will scare the sh*t out of you. no lie. they happen completely at random and are not expected at all. these glitches include but ARE NOT LIMITED TO:-walking up to NPCs that are scared of you because they know you are a warewolf and a LOUD, GLITCHY, WEARWOLF GROWL PLAYED ON FULL BLAST QUEUES IN. so at first its like peacefull music and then LOUD SCARY GLTICH NOISES FOLLOWED BY RAPID NPC MOVEMENTS.-character bugging. at times after completing cirtain quests sometimes the charachter your supposed to talk to, glitches out and becomes only HALF a charachter. His face is missing, the whole front half of his body is missing. its freaky as hell.these are the two biggest things that killed this game for me. I was rather enjoying the game but after being scared sh*tless like that i cant go on. sorry guys, im a ♥♥♥♥♥ but i cant do it.A scary horror game is a scary horror game. this was not ment to be a horror game, the glitches MADE it a horror game."

It's a hair pullingly frustrating game format that most people abandonned in the point and click days. In it's new release state, it also has a long list of bugs, some potentially game breaking, and is seriously lacking in in game options for the most basic things, like screen resolution.The game looks and feels more like a high grade earning school project that demonstrates all the key priniciples in game design without actually embracing any of them and does not feel at all like a finished commercial product... Definitely the first candidate of the year for Worst Game of 2014, but it's not so bad that it will likely retain the title, as there will surely be worse games released by the end of the year."
76561198040367630,Not Recommended,259640,8904989,"Posted: 29 January, 2014",all,Wolfman,"Let me  start by saying that the developers should be ashamed of themselves for this project. (except the music artists... they did good.)  In no way shape form or fashion at the final stages of development should you all have said, ""Yeah, game looks good, ship it out.""  Were you rushed?  Were you strapped financially?  Those questions are irrelevant.  After a project like this your company should just fold, hand in the towel, and send its employee's elsewhere to find better career opportunities.  This game is TERRIBLE.Now to the meat and potatoes, so we can figure out why its bad.  (I am not even going to give a warning for spoilers, because I think everyone who bought this should fight steam and have them refund their purchase.  Anyone who has not bought it.. DON'T!)I played this game for 2 hours and 54 minutes (approximately) that is from start to finish.  The opening of the game gives you no indicator that the story is even actually happening beyond the main character saying that he needs to go someplace and find someone.  It starts you off in a fashion that someone made a level in unreal tournement where you spawn in a location with no intro.  There should have at least been a cutscene introduction on par with the ending cutscene of the game. (don't get me started on the quality of the ending cutscene, but at least a cutscene to explain what is going on is nessesary!!!)With no true direction (or clue) to where to find your current target objective (due to a lack in informative begining), you might decide to follow the blood trail to a horse.  Thats it for the clues beyond that. You are then greeted with the option to head for the gates, only to be told that you are missing something.  now with no sense of injury or purpose, you then are left to wander the cold wilderness in an attempt to find the corpse of a character that is literally meaningless to the plot due to no introduction or other such information.You are then greeted with yet another way the game decides to illustrate story.  By walking up to the gate, it immediately warps you to a bed chamber and a talk to a literal stick of a human being.  The characters that ARE present in the game, are emotionless and look like they are incredibly dated (probably inspired by 2001 time period character models) HELL THATS BEING GENEROUS!Regardless, the options are bland, they don't have any apparant meaning for either selection of choice, and the voices seem remarkably quiet and uninspired.  And this is constant through the game, when you actually do get choices for dialogue.The game play is dated, adventure games have come along way since this rustic example of old school room escape games.  (even in those games, the items you used to solve the puzzles disappeared out of your inventory.)  Instead, the items you collect kinda serve to guide you as a gauge for how much longer you have to suffer through the game.The tutorial consists of a help file that opens from the options, or in the start of the game.  And even that tutorial does not actually explain some of the mechanics of the game (LIKE THE STEALING MECHANIC!)  Its ambiguous, and not intuitive.  There should have been a small, subtle example of each mechanic as the game introduces them to you, but it never does explain anything in the game.  It doesn't even have a story that really truely explains what exactly is going on.The story is there, but its vague, and rarely seen.  The journal entry literally gives a hint as to your next direction, and that is your only motivation to do much of anything.  Its rediculous.The stealth mechanics are terrible.  There are two spaces in the game where you are actually supposed to hide from the crappy looking werewolf.  TWO.  And one of the doesn't work.  Those two specific instances don't even really add to the tense atmosphere that was supposed to be there.  one of them was out right  broken, and I ended up solving the area, by grabbing the cog, and dying only to appear back at the ladder with the cog in my inventory.  The stealing in the game is effortless and in general unessesary outside of two times due to the lack of need for anymore than 200 gold pieces.  You only need to steal a minimum of 3 times.  And when you do need to steal, there is no indicator as to where and who you need to steal from.  Good luck guessing on a first playthrough.There is no sneaking in the game.  There is no descernable combat in the game.  There are very small amounts of platforming, and the puzzles are actually few and far in between.  Its mostly collection oriented situations.  ""Man I would like an apple."" - go get apple- ""Thanks, here is a key to the door to continue the game."" - rinse and repeat.The music, is good.  The music is actually well done, and probably the only thing worth-while in this game. After this dev team is disolved I hope that the music artist will get a job somewhere else.The end cutscene in the game looks and runs like a damn story board.  The art is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because it looks genuinely un finished.  If you ever watch a story boarding session for disney or something, you will see how this cutscene runs.  Its insulting.I paraphrased alot of what the issues are with the game.  And if you realy want to see how bad it is, then check out my youtube channel for the whole playthrough of the game. In closing, the game is not worth a penny, its clearly an early alpha build at best.  I spent some of my time trying to figure out how to unlock myself from the terrain I clipped through, or figuring out how to get back into the level after moving through it.  Bad game is bad, and this one is just terrible.  Not worth the time, not worth the money, and a disappointing addition to the ever small selection of werewolf titles.Devs, you asked me to play the demo for you, and you got my hopes up, and you got me excited.  I jumped in to green light this game, I spoke highly of it for you people.  And then you do me this.  I am sorry for sounding brutal, but I am honest.  You mislead anyone that believes your description of the game.  Half of the description for the game in the steam advertisement section, is either pulling for strings in an effort to sell the game to folks, or outright lying.  This game is terrible, and I am not happy that I jumped and spent money on this title.  Anyone that bought it, needs to go and demand steam refund the purchase.If you are one of the two people (at the time of this review) who gave this game a thumbs up (despite the 4/10 from one of you), you should come chat with me so I can show you some actual good games to play to put this game into some perspective.  That or I would be lead to believe that you were paid to give your shallow praises for the game.Bad show devs... bad show.  I want my money back.  I would suggest you either take this game off the steam roster, or drop the price to free to play.  This is (at the time of this review) a 15 dollar purchase.  I expect much more from you guys if you are going to charge this much."
76561198017479536,Not Recommended,259640,8919491,"Posted: 31 January, 2014",all,Kuchenko,"This game was an absolute MESS. After the initial... I hesitate to call it a quest because it wasn't, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the game was broken as the key to moving forward (I hesitate to call it a puzzle) relies on a mechanic that the game never really tells you exists. There aren't really any puzzles, certainly none that couldn't be solved by applying a solitary brain cell to them. The only challenging part to this game is finding all the things necessary to complete missions, and that's not a good kind of challenge. It's one that frustratingly made me stay up until four in the morning playing because I wanted to see if it redeemed itself in the end and I knew I wouldn't have the willpower to start it up again if I shut it off. The combat is wholly unnecessary, as you can quite blithely run straight past the guards who are too slow to swing to really do any damage to you and not only don't chase you, if you transform right in front of their bloody eyes and then leave the room and come back, they have apparently FORGOTTEN that the alchemist they're talking to just transformed into an unholy beast right in front of their eyes, making them utterly superfluous. Not helped is the fact that their dialogue (And pretty much everybody elses) is completely phoned in on the part of the voice actors. There are only four characters in this game, counting yourself, and two of them have a whopping THREE LINES, and yet we're supposed to care about them. Oh, and that monster they're always touting? Seen three times in the game. You see it, it chases you, you hide or cut off its path, and then it just gives up IMMEDIATELY.  I regret this purchase. I sincerely, sincerely regret it."

,Not Recommended,259640,8991450,"Posted: 5 February, 2014",all,Soy Akita,"Quite simply, do not buy this game.I found myself intrigued about this game being about werewolves. But the story really fell flat on it's face. There is no real substance or engagement in the very brief storytelling. After being given a screen telling you the controls; you're unceremoniously plopped in a field with no clear objective what to do. That theme continued throughout the game.For being a puzzle based game; the puzzles themselves are easy and short. Having to navigate from objective to objective is numbly frustrating. I found myself consulting the community guides just to find out where to go next, as the game will not tell you. The game itself is very short, easily beaten in one sitting after you understand your objectives. The only real challenge, as I said, is figuring out where to go next on your own with no hints.There are no game settings. You get one setting and that's it. My XBOX controller half worked in the beginning. But, glitch after glitch, I gave up and went back to the keyboard and mouse. And even that didn't fully work. I didn't experience any game-breaking bugs. But, the glitches and sub-par programming will annoy you.I would not recommend this game, regardless of the price. It's too short, minimal story, missing objective tracking and glitchy."

76561198015121697,Not Recommended,259640,9165167,"Posted: 17 February, 2014",all,BenzinBier,"I have to get this out of the way first and foremost - I am a HUGE fan of werewolf fiction. Not Stephenie Meyer's shape-shifting pet poodles, or the wolf anthros that plaster Furaffinity, Tumblr and DeviantART; the horror werewolves that made the werewolf the legendary creature it is today. And I'm sure you are too! But I just can't help but feel that this is a cash-in on one of horror's most venerated creatures.When I first started Identity of the Canine, it was good enough for an indie game. The atmosphere of some serious faecal matter was about to happen was great and the controls were intuitive enough that I didn't need to reference the controls at all. Then it came to an abrupt halt when I was rudly told at the front gate that I had to look for some special item. Scrounging around the countryside (if it can be called that) of naked trees with a ridiculous cartoony outline for about 45 minutes, I finally found an axe in the least probable area one would expect to find it: Lodged on the opposite area of the map where the logging cabin was! Suffice it to say that it was one of the most jarring treasure-hunts for the most basic item that shattered the suspension of disbelief. But a voice in my head said, ""Be nice. It is their first game. They at least took your advice to take out the irrelevant jump-scares.""I was starting to wonder why I listened to that voice in the first place until I saw the highlight of the gaming year so far - a poorly voiced Russian princess (who oddly has a Spanish name and British-American accent) with a shocking taste in clothing and historical accuracy, and a comical outline that gave her the hint of a five o' clock shadow. After I finally stopped laughing if only to save my underpants, I began laughing at the dialogue structure. It's so clichèd with the genre and roles of the characters that I had to step out for five minutes to calm down. It's not totally asinine, though. There is a nichè choice structure that at least changed the next piece of dialogue, but for the sake of the chair and linen - I muted the sound. The magic-man behind bars was a similar story, though his voice acting was at least a cut above the rest. The Count wasn't much better than either, and his lines screamed of his role in the story. Probably the most organic lines came from the guard to the front door, and that was just plain flat. But I calmly reminded myself that Shape of the Lupine was still an indie game.I know I said the controls were tight and intuitive enough that I didn't need to look up the controls again, but the gameplay itself was like the graphics - patchy, glitchy and unforgiving at best, and nightmarish cluster-bomb on common sense's front doorstep at worst. Getting chased by the hairy attack dog was a nice shot of adrenaline through the game, but its appearances give you no option to escape or hide other than the linear chase prescribed by the developers. One chase even has you charging TOWARD the werewolf when there are no less than three good hiding spots to wait for the hulking mastiff to pass on. And no less than five times did I think, ""Hang on. There are windows around with moonlight coming through, and I have an axe which smashes through baricades. Why can't I fight the poodle?"" I discovered the answer after being savaged for the umpteenth time: because it's not using your brain. I know that the protagonist is a brainiac in his own little lunch-box, but we, the cruel angels of fate, are not. By this point, I was thoroughly outraged I spent $15 on a game worth about $7 for its cheap laughs and wacky graphics. But brace yourself for a shock, because there are some things that did go right. Just enough to bump its worth up to a possible $8.50.The fact that you can turn into a werewolf, if only for two minutes and in set checkpoints of moonlight, is really what gives a credible note to the game. It was a nice little feature but it sucks in that the only combat takes place in wolf form. Even then, it's you - the unstoppable pet bulldog of The Hulk - against a scared guardsman just following orders. Horror games like Outlast and Amnesia have little, if any, combat, but it's done well! You can run, you can stun, you can hide, you can be savaged and wait for the beasties to pass on post-mortem - not follow blind instructions to the letter by running down a hall and pressing the ""I Won the Race"" button. Taking a chunk out of the guards was oddly satisfying in its own demented way, but I soon felt guilty after killing the most human and realistic characters in the game.I still think it was a damn shame that you couldn't take a chunk out of the characters that mattered to the wearily predictable plot. You have so many stereotypes packed into each character that you can judge their role just by looking at them - the cursed love interest (if you hadn't worked that out within the first ten minutes, you were probably too busy staring at her incredibly well-endowed bosum), the bad guy with a name, the deus ex chamberpot, the bored guard, the scared castle hand, the self-insert know-it-all-but-can't-remember-a-thing protagonist, the.... Oh wait, that's the list. They're so riddled with nits and bullet-holes that it's hard to sympathise with any of the characters. Hard at best and frustratingly difficult at worst, but it is possible. I did find myself at one point going, ""Awww.... Poor Filch."" Though it still doesn't excuse the fact that he only shows up once in a while to say a few lines, give you a book and reveal his backstory, only to leave you hanging for the puzzles. The princess is about as useless as you would expect as anything other than the protagonist's love-interest McGuffin, and the Count's plan was sure to backfire from stage one. I'm sure it sounded great to the drunk, semi-literate peasant farmer who the Count discussed the plans with, but he could have at least planned it with someone along the lines of Caesar or Alexander to get the kinks outFor those cheaky strumpets that skipped right to the bottom: A good game this is not. Good and Likeness of the Wild Tundra Dog just don't mix. Not bad for what it's worth, but just not good! By all means, get it in a sale or for the cheap laughs or if only for the fact it has werewolves in it, but not for something serious."

76561198130948719,Recommended,259640,34515933,Posted: 26 August,all,Gamboleer,"HARDWARE: Win 10x64, i5 3570, GTX 1070. No slowdowns, no crashes. Initial lockups on loading screen that appear to be related to using Windows 10, but I was able to fix (see end of the review).I was surprised to find I'm actually enjoying this game, given its harsh reviews, It's far from perfect, but it's also far from being a bad game at the current price point of $2.99. I'd probably be annoyed if I were expecting a AAA title and paid $50 for it, but it's fun despite a number of polish issues.There was a major controversy surrounding this game and its developer's fight with a prominent Youtube reviewer in 2014. I have no dog in that fight, and it's not a consideration in my review.The game:- It has a good fictional premise: you're an alchemist hired to help stop a mysterious beast that has been attacking people in and near a castle, during the Middle Ages.- The artwork is great, sort of a combination of cell-shading and 3D. It looks fairly primitive, but there is something about the style that tickles my fancy. I especially enjoyed the courtyard with falling snow.- The music is evocative.- It's fully voiced. The writing is generally good, with some obvious weak bits. The same goes for the voice acting.- It does a good job keeping the plot moving.The game isn't without its problems:- It tries to install an unnecessary component (Ogg Vorbis) when you launch. I decline every time,- Running in Windows 10 requires setting Windows 7 + Administrator compatibility modes on the game's executable file, or it freezes on the load screen.- The game only supports auto-saves, done every time your journal updates. This means lost progress if you want to quit before hitting a new save point.- You can't view the keybinds within the game.- Advancing requires reading the manual, because it describes a couple of controls / features you are unlikely to figure out on your own, and they are necessary to understand or you'll get stuck VERY early. However, the manual spoils a couple of surprises that I think are better left to experiencing in-game. You can read my as-non-spoiler-as-possible hints instead:(1) You'll need to use the pickpocketing ability early, which requires crouching (CTRL) and using the interact / hand icon while behind your target. (2) To get past the area where you turn into a wolf the first time, you'll need to use your wolf abilities (run and swipe) on more than one target.- Some of the things you must do are fictionally illogical, such asthe early requirement to pickpocket guards.- Similarly illogical are the chests scattered about that you can (must?) pick.- The map is useless, as it's just 2D sprites and doesn't show your position.- NPC models and animations are pretty crude, though they get the job done.- Puzzles are super simple, not much above walking simulator level (might be a positive depending on your preferences).Most of the above are technical / polish issues that could be patched, though it seems unlikely they will be at this point. The underlying game is fundamentally sound, and an enjoyable experience with a little patience for its rough bits.FIXING THE LOADING SCREEN FREEZE ON WINDOWS 10:Setting Windows 7 and Administrator mode on the two game executables fixed it for me:- RIGHT-click on Guise of the Wolf in in your list of games, and select PROPERTIES.- Select the LOCAL FILES tab, then BROWSE LOCAL FILES- Open the GAME folder- Set the two Guise of the Wolf files to Windows 7 and Run as Administrator compatibility mode:- RIGHT click and select PROPERTIES- Select the COMPATIBILITY tab.- Check the box to run in COMPATIBILITY MODE, and set it to Windows 7.- Check the box to RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR.- Click OK."

The problem with games based so much on puzzles is occasionally you bump into a puzzle you can't solve and that brings your gameplay to a dead halt. I ran into that fairly early on, and if I hadn't found a walkthrough, I probably would have stopped playing. The solution to that particular puzzle wasn't ridiculous -- it made sense -- but I doubt I would have thought of it. And it was a lot of fun running around as a werewolf, smashing pylons... until I realized I'd missed one somewhere in that insanely complicated map. It took me two days to figure out which one I'd overlooked! But overall, if you don't mind the 1990s-style graphics, I recommend it."

Your main goal is to cure yourself and stop the werewolf who gave you the bite in the first place. Along the way, you learn to control the transformation, to the point only direct moonlight can make you turn.I'll rate the game overall in 5 categories:Replayability: 4/10If you want to get all of the achivements you need a minimum of 2 playthroughs to get all of them (because there's 2 endings).Graphics: 6/10Standard graphics, seems like a cartoon set in 2005, but it doesn't impede the experience.Story: 7/10Again, if you're into midevil/alchemy, you'll find this interesting to say the least.Voice acting: 3/10It helps to have a map.Overall experience: 6/10Read total below.Overall: 5/10It's not at all a bad game, nearly all of the negative reviews were due to the fact it didn't release trading cards along with it's innitial release which is sad that's all people care about rather than enjoying the game. If you have a couple of hours to kill (if you don't follow a guide and just play the game normally) you'll find a good experience to say the least."

I packed the things and I moved further.Having stolen a key from the policeman I got to the cellar and I found the person locked in a cage.

Truly, this is a remarkable breakthrough in the gaming industry. The studio behind this masterpiece have made their entrance into the gaming world and it looks like they'll be sticking around. My sense of smell actually feels heightened and I can feel the tingling hairs on my nipples as they grow tenfold. Can you smell what the ROCK is cookin? I smell a sequel, do you? But I digress, reviewing time baby.The game throws away unconventional and worthless things like clipping. You, the player of masterpieces, will have nearly infinite freedom. No longer will we be limited to roads and paths, this is the FUTURE. The first rock you encounter will have something special cookin' inside of it, so make sure you go in there and look! You won't want to leave-and can't!Next, we do away with voice acting. These NPC's do not know what acting is! They are alive! Each one of them feels like a dear friend and every person you encounter shares a special memory with you. When they are harmed you can truly feel their anguish and pain. Don't even get me started on the wolf. It's just like Jakob from Twilight. Hell, I even named him Jakob. He is unmatched in his CGI cutscenes, nearly ruining every other game character with the sheer awesomeness of an ability called existence. The dialogue is very open and you even have the option to say things in different orders. Sometimes, I forget it's a game and howl into the night. Say farewell to your life because this game truly absorbs you into its dark atmosphere. I won't spoil the plot. I can't even fully comprehend it. Its complexity cannot be adequately appreciated until I complete a novel version for all to read. I've already written 9,001 pages and I've barely touched 12% of the whole plot.You see my friends, you MAKE the plot. The creators took a gamble and allowed YOU, the player of masterpieces, to create your own story. It leaves many plotholes on purpose for your imagination to fill in, making the replay value infinity.Beware, once you start this game you may contract a disease known as ""Large Dong"". I'll let the details be a surprise, but know that you won't want it to be cured. Keep napkins closeby as the female lead is a true Goddess. Her beautiful voice echoes forever in your mind and you'll spend the vast majority of the game not actually playing but searching for this divine Amazonian. She watches over the player giving advice and health/love potions from time to time. You'll fall in love with her soothing voice quickly, so be sure to listen to her.Make sure you check the map often. It really helps, the guards told me so and they've seen everything. Everything! Good luck sneaking by them. Additionally, they're incredibly handsome. If you find that you cannot contain your primitive lust I must warn you to be extremely careful when patting them down. The one named Jesom specifically likes his left ear stroked gently. Try it, you'll get a extra 15 gold.Play on, friends. This game is the greatest buy of my life, and I bought twelve ladyboys for a night.AWRHOOOOOO!AWHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!"
