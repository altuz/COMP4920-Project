,Recommended,259700,7760515,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,AinTunez,"Not bad. A great concept and fun, but some of the details make it really frustrating, at least in the single player mode. After your inevitable death, you have to start at the very beginning of the level, often going through (awkwardly slow) cutscenes again. You can't hold more than one weapon at once, and when you do have a decent weapon, it's use it or lose it. You can't switch back to your infinite-ammo pistol to save the better gun for something later. I gave up on one of the single player missions because I'm convinced it's not supposed to be possible.Still, the game manages to be fun, and the multiplayer probably has a lot to offer when you're playing with four friends."

I wasn't expecting much as I don't normally like games that are birds' eye view but I figured since it was a zombie game there might be a chance I'd like it. I haven't played a lot yet, only about an hour's worth but so far I really enjoy it. You can play either single player or online multiplayer depending on what you prefer, giving you the option to chose what you like best. Based on the bit I've played and the assumtion it will continue to be as good, I would highly reccomend Dead Sky. Of course there is the chance that I may change my mind after playing more but I strongly believe this game will continue to be good. If you can afford $10 without it being an issue if you don't end up liking it, give it a try."

The graphics are pretty good, the controls (360) are a sluggish for aiming, but the real reason I give it such low marks it that it isn't fun.  The music feels like it is going to be high energy but then you shoot a couple of endless zombies that feels more C64 days then Left For Dead.  The chopper mini-gun has the damage capacity of a .22.  You have to hit everything multiple times and you don't get the BAM BOOM feel, more like tink tink.  At least if this was in Beta they might fix some of these problems but as it is production, ""I think it's dead Jim"".Also CUT the CUT scenes faster, there is nothing more action packed and exciting then watching 3 characters (at the end of the single person bridge screen) walk slowly to the end of the screen.  I am glad they are in a hurry and millions of zombies are on their tail."

There are a major list of Problems they should fix though in my opinion this is what they shoud be:Health Drops: i mean there is no other way to regain health other then surviving the wave which isn't good enough sometimes.Inventory: Needs one so you can cycle weapons instead of just having to keep changing out guns.Online Lobbies: Fix them i mean i sit there waiting for 30mins trying to get inot an online game.Also i don't know what it is but my computer can run Deadspace 3 graphics on ultra high and it can't run this game very well. Please consider fixing this game otherwise i just wasted $6 and i really enjoy the game.

While the concept sounds interesting on paper, the execution is far from resembling anything that could ever be mistaken as a fun diversion. Even the title screen comes off as clunky and amateur. And I wish I had heeded the warning bells that screen set off in my head, because the gameplay is far worse. It's actually kind of an impressive achievement, come to think of it-- Dead Sky is so void of entertainment value that it is impossible to even revel in how bad it is.Zombies are supposed to be the pizza of videogames; even bad pizza is still pretty good. And yet Dead Sky somehow manages to make even killing zombies feel boring and tedious. I can honestly say I have never regretted a purchase as much as Dead Sky. Even if the game was free-to-play I would not recommend that anyone play it. There are better trainwrecks out there. Don't even bother rubbernecking this one out of curiosity."

Poor controls, tedious gameplay and an unforgiving ai makes this game a no-go. The biggest problem is the game doesnt give you what you need to survive making it frustrating/impossibe to complete on any difficulty. Now I'm not saying hard is a bad thing, I like a challenge but when a game doesnt give you the chance to get better weapons or health then whats the point. go ahead and skip on this game even if the price is cheap."

I gave up on the second level when I found no way to heal myself. special weapon ammo is spotty at best, and I never got to a point where I could really try the turrets, though the first level would indicate it to be lacking. The lighting was far too dark as well, though that may just be more my monitor then anything else. If they ever give this game some serious TLC i might give it another shot, but at this point, it's just not worth playing."

Either I'm skilled or the game is to easy and short. I dont know if they are exstending it or leaving it to be a 40 minute game but there are fun suvival maps that you can play with friend. I think this game is going in a good direction but it needs more game modes better JOIN as you have to type in IP addresses to the server you want. Yes there are alot of negitive things in this review but the game style and the game play was fun! But lack of content is letting the game down. 4/10

,Not Recommended,259700,15999941,"Posted: 25 May, 2015",all,MroTralisk,"This is a standard over-view camera Zombie Defense game with Borderland style graphics.  It doesn't seem finished...There are occasional ""Air Support"" drops where you're given a short amount of time to fly around shooting zombies in a helicopter.  There are no campaign maps, all strictly defense.  Can I recommend this game...no.  Try Dead Horde, Yet Another Zombie Defense, or Survival Squad.4/105/25/15"
