,Recommended,259740,19224223,"Posted: 22 November, 2015",all,Faudraline,"...and here we have another Artifex Mundi caliber HOG. I've been meaning to play this game for ages now. Finally being able to find the time, I'm rushing here to give you my full review.Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heartis one of Artifex Mundi's earlier games, thus it is quite possible to encounter amateur mistakes or some clumsy animations now and then. Yet, the charm attached to the developer’s name doesn't fail to entertain us anyway.Here we have Sarah Black, the curator of the Caribbean Museum and the mother of one cheery teenage girl, preparing the exhibition of a life time. The mummified corpse of Henry Remington, most notorious pirate of the Caribbean Sea back in 1800s is finally discovered and retrieved from his resting place: ""Davy Jones' Locker"" a.k.a the bottom of the sea. The corpse is delivered to the museum for the exhibition, and Sarah prepares him to be displayed. Just as we were thinking that he seems kinda handsome for a corpse that's been lying at the bottom of the sea for some centuries, he comes back to life, kidnaps our daughter, summons his ghost ship and sets sail to Skull Island... Oh, where did I see that before?Okay, okay, I'll say it. I have no idea about the rest of the series yet, but this first game is basically a retelling ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestwithout Captain Jack Sparrow to lighten up the mood. But as the first instalment of theNightmares from the Deepseries - and possibly the most clumsily done -The Cursed Heartstill finds means to keep you interested, with a detailed story of its own, weaved out of countless nautical folktales. Hey, I'm glad that we have a name for the protagonist at least, contrary to ""Madame Detective"" ofLeft in the Dark.Artwork is most brilliant with its eerie depictions, nautical themes and an expected amount of undead roaming around. At this point, no one expects Artifex Mundi to present bad artwork, even with its older titles. What I do wonder though, is that how they've managed to make cinematics in lower quality than actual game artwork. Cinematics are blurry and less presentable compared to actual in-game artworks. Same goes for the voice acting: voice acting itself is beyond par, but the lip synch is non-existent: people do move their mouths rhythmically, that's all. I think this is forgivable considering that this is an older title though.Here comes the gameplay: we have quite enjoyable and clear HOG scenes, some FROG scenes, a good amount of enjoyable puzzles and alternative Mahjong games if you are bored of object hunting. It takes at least 2 playthroughs to complete all achievements - one for HOGs, one for Mahjong games. The map is not interactive, but you get used to the environment quickly, and there is little backtracking aside going back to the ship to place a Dubloon on a chest and listen to an undead dwarf tell a story now and then. What's that about? You gotta play the game to learn!Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heartis probably not Artifex Mundi's best game, but it is a promising title and the start of a possibly enjoyable journey on a series. If you'd manage to grab it on sale, you'd enjoy it thoroughly when you'd be in the mood for a pleasant little HOG.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

,Recommended,259740,9016009,"Posted: 8 February, 2014",all,Jackie Moon,"Short game, trite story, beautiful art, nice theme song.This is the first hidden object adventure game I have ever played, but I am a veteran of the old 90's style point and click adventures.For the most part you wander around, seemingly at random, until you find a ""swirly"" spot to click on.  This will start a hidden object scene search, upon completion you will be awarded an item, although some items are found without hidden object searches as well (general environment finds).Some of these items are used in puzzles, some of them are keys, and the rest are your traditional use on environment items that adventure fans are familiar with.  None of the puzzles are challenging, and all are logical.  The only exception to this rule is the ""Urns"" puzzle - the final one in the game.  Thankfully you can hit a button and skip any puzzle if you want, but this version of the game also has a strategy guide which you can access from the menu (probably not during a game though, but I never tested this).This version of the game does come with some digital ""extras"", most notably 8 beautiful (up to 1080p) wallpapers which are taken from the memorable scenes in the game.  In fact you can see three of these in the screenshots on the Steam Store page.  Naturally you get to play back any video you have already seen, and there is also some concept art (but not much, six images to be precise).Oh, there's also a mahjong game if you want to play that instead of finding hidden objects, but I never tried that feature.For the price I feel like the game is too short, versus something like Monkey Island II - another zombie themed pirate adventure, and probably the best adventure game of all time.  However, it's worth playing if you like pirates and the sounds of thunder and lightning and want to have the beautiful wallpaper art on your desktop (I do)."
,Recommended,259740,9053579,"Posted: 11 February, 2014",all,krayzkrok,"Ok, I have become shamelessly addicted to these hidden object games. Having played three, I now consider myself an expert on them. Definitely. Anyway, this is a good one. Just don't judge it on the quality of its story and voice acting, both of which are subpar at best. It seems to be a genre convention actually, so I can go with the flow. No, these games depend more on the quality of their artwork, the level of interactivity in scenes, the quality of the puzzles (if any), and how well things sparkle and zing when you click on them. No really, when you find that hairbrush hidden carefully in the background of a scene, you want some fireworks when you click on it. It's satisfying, I admit it. I get the impression, reading around, that this developer is considered a good one when it comes to HOGs. I wouldn't know, but on the strength of this it's well-deserved. The game's quite long; it took me a little over 6 hours to complete the game (including the two bonus chapters as this is the CE) which is about twice as long as some HOG games. Like most of these games, the difficulty level was towards the easier end of the spectrum, but frankly that works just fine inbetween bouts of Spelunky and Jets 'n' Guns. It's relaxing, and strangely compelling. Interestingly, each hidden object scene also offers a mahjong game. You can either do one or the other, and the more of the HOG you complete, the easier the mahjong game becomes (and vice versa). It's a good way of trying a different approach if you're stuck trying to find a particular object. That didn't happen very often with me, but I appreciated the option. There's no time limit on completing each scene, but if you do them quickly you can gather a few Steam achievements. The achievements were a little bugged though, not all of them registered, if that kind of thing is important to you. Puzzles? Yes, plenty of those, most of them very easy, but they're a nice change of pace. The game surrounding the hidden object scenes plays out like a point and click adventure, with an inventory and objects that must be found and used in the appropriate places, so there's plenty of variety to keep you going. There's even a map!So overall then, the best HOG-like I've ever played (out of the three I've played over the last month). GOTY in the HOG category so far, in fact! But seriously, if you like this kind of thing you can't really go wrong. The artwork is excellent, the music and presentation are great, the storyline and acting are like fingernails on a blackboard, you'll love it."
,Recommended,259740,16000583,"Posted: 25 May, 2015",all,Bacon Overlord®,"Hidden object and adventure.Highs:I was impressed by the animation that went into portions of the game.  It went beyond the usual throw-in story of most hidden object adventures.The plot was decent and you were reminded pretty constantly of what was going on by contextual clues.The location of the next hidden-object puzzle is usually hidden in the most-current location (a picture, etc) otherwise you can just spam the hint button and it will get  you to the right area.High resolution puzzles made it easy to pick out the items that were required and lots of hidden object puzzles were present in the game (with only a couple of exceptions)Lows:The doubling back to the ""guardian"" to unlock the chest that takes like 20 doubloons to open was kind of annoying.  It isn't required throughout the game, but that's not made apparent while you're playing.A couple of the puzzles had sections that were a bit hazy and fuzzy on large monitors.All in all, this was a good game.  I enjoyed the story.  Not so much the fact that you were a talking character (and female at that) which disconnected me from the main character a bit.  But, still it's a game and it was a good one even if some of the sequences were pretty obvious."
,Recommended,259740,16822653,"Posted: 1 July, 2015",all,BridgetFisher,"This Hidden Object game is one of the best on steam, this is the collectors edition of this game even though it listed as the standard version.  There are storytelling sections including vivid 3d visuals combined with some of the best voice acting for pirates in a pirate game even better than Assassins Creed Black Flag.  This story has it all from Mystery, to Action, to even Romance!  It does all these things, and does them all really well.Difficulty for players would be a bit above normal.    No worries if stuck, there i a fully illustrated strategy guide, a puzzle skip option, and a hint button for puzzles so anyone will be able to finish the game.  The map is structured well with clues leading to more clues not just random running around to check every part of the game.  The ability to play the game and have it progress as you move makes it one of the few Hidden Object games that can be used for speed runs.Completionist Advice:The game has many achievement bugs, best way to avoid these seems to play the first game through on expert doing all of the hidden Object Puzzles using no hints and skipping no puzzles.  Collect all the coins, do not put them in one by one, and when you have 12 coins put them all in.  Second playthrough on normal do Mahjong instead of HIdden Object puzzles to clean up the rest.  The hardest is to beat a puzzle in under one minute best done on second playthrough on the first couple puzzles, just click like crazy!*Would be 10/10 Perfection but achievement bugs knock off a point.Rating:  9/10  Value:  9.99"

76561198141404871,Recommended,259740,17766953,"Posted: 28 August, 2015",all,joan4003,"First game in a present three game series.Story: Museum Director Sarah Black is putting together an exhibition surrounding pirates and one pirate captain in particular, Captain Henry Remington.  Unwittingly Sarah triggers 'ancient' magic and revives the cursed Captain.  Captain Remington upon his revival steals Sarah's daughter, Cory.  Of course, Sarah follows and stows away on Captain Remington's summoned ""ghost"" ship as it sets sail for Captain Remington's island.  As Captain Remington's story unfolds the player discovers his personal history, his cursed 'life' and why he stole Sarah's daughter.  Sarah with the help of a surprising ally convinces Captain Remington that what he wants to do will only cause more tradegy.Gameplay is basically set up to occur in three distinct arenas, the museum, Remington's ship, and Remington's island.  The tragic tale of Captain Remington is revealed through the various characters (mostly his undead crew, who were cursed when he was, assuming the player talks to them).  Rather reminscent of the 'Pirates of Caribbean' first movie and the tale of 'The Flying Dutchman'.   Captain Remington's entire tale is told by the Guardian of Remington's chest, which contains the collateral of Remington's Davy Jone's bargain, whenever coins are found and given to the Guardian.  Very keeping with the Davy Jones motif and legends.The puzzles are classic, nothing hard or head scratching.  The game even includes a 'treasure hunt'.  (When I saw the 'treasure' map, it reminded me of 'Treasure Island'.)  There are enough hidden object scenes to keep this a Hidden Object game.  The puzzles and hidden objects scenes are intergrated well enough into the storyline that they do not stand out, which in my opinion is a very good thing.  However, since the gameplay arenas are limited to three areas there is a lot of back and forth movement within the area until everything is completed.  Some may find this annoying but the amount of things needed to be done and accomplished within the area keeps the gameplay moving.Being the first Artifex Mundi game I have ever played I found I enjoyed the well written storyline as well as the overall gameplay.  This game would and did bring me back to buy more, not only of this series, but other games by them, as well."

The game is short and the story isn't much of one if anything, but the puzzles can be fun for the 30 seconds they last and getting around is quick and easyAs most other reviews say, the sound quality is bad and i found it annoying that the lips didn't sync with the voice audio. On another note, trying to play this at 1080p in fullscreen caused the image to noticeably resize itself each scene. Not sure whether that was my own fault or not, but there are only a handful of options in the game and resolution done automatically through the game. I ended up just playing in window mode to avoid this especially since i knew the game was short. The only other thing i can think to say is that my mouse had lag issues during the game which required me to adjust my DPI on the mouse software itself as there is no mouse sensitivty setting in game.I cant judge the game too harshly because i haven't played any other of the genre. i would say that if it weren't pirate themed i wouldn't have an interest in it. If you are interested wait for a sale. I wouldn't purchase this game or any of the sequels at full price."

It wasn't until I looked on the steam forums that I saw others were having the same problem and the developers of the game said that they would have a fix for this, but it hasn't been fixed as of yet. So in order to get the achievement I had to finished the game in the 'extras' section  all at once. (No exiting the game and coming back to it later) and that worked. The other problem is the cutscenes are super blurry. I mean- the game would be so great, if the cutscenes didn't go super pixilated, but they did. I looked this up on the forums as well and the developers said they would fix this issue as well. I am hoping that the sequels to the game do not have these issues, but I will still play them because I found this one to be fun and entertaining despite the issues. I would say get them on sale, as it seems it would be worth it then, not at full price with the couple of bugs that are going on."

I am a huge fan of Hidden Object games, and this one is actually pretty solid. As far as I can tell you have your main storyline, which isn't anything that's going to blow you away, but it fills it's purpose. It's not a straight up ""find these objects, then move to the next room"" type of game, there is a lot to do here, and the great thing about it is you have a very useful hint button for when you get stuck...trust me you will.

I didn't expect much from this kind of game but come on.-The puzzles vary, but they get repetitive to a point where playing the puzzles just becomes a chore.Gameplay-66/100Graphics-82/100Audio-44/100Concept/Story-69Features-60Entertainment Value-53/100Overall Game Score-62/100 (Below Average, it serves it's purpose and provides you with some puzzles to solve whenever your bored)Buy it when it goes on sale again.

Since I love both of those franchises and enjoyed Artifex Mundi’sGrim Legends: The Forsaken Bride, this game was an obvious follow-up choice. Similar toGrim Legends: The Forsaken Bride, the story relies on the Damsel in Distress trope to motivate the player, although the player is playing as a female character in both games (mom in one case and twin sister in the other). On a more personal note, it was fun to start off in a museum and play a character who is a museum professional since that’s my job in reality as well. I liked that the bonus adventure was about how to get off the island and home because it tied up the loose ends in the storyline.There are some nice gameplay featuresNightmares from the Deephas thatGrim Legends: The Forsaken Bridedoesn’t have (or if it does have them it didn’t really explain how to use them). For example, I appreciated that the purpose of the Mahjong games was explained better. The puzzles were fun, even though a couple of typos (probably from translation errors) did cause a little confusion in a couple of puzzles. I did have a little bit of trouble with a bug causing achievements to not unlock properly, but it didn't ruin my enjoyment of the game (multiple playthroughs!) and it has now been resolved so new players should have no trouble unlocking achievements.TL;DR – If you like pirates and adventure games, this is a good bet for you!"

Quickly you find yourself in hot pursuit to set her free. The game is the first part of a trilogy.While I didn't have high hopes for this game, I quickly found myself hooked on progressing through the game. The main game is a point & click adventure, but combined with 3 types of sub-games. First there are puzzles, which are usually not too difficult to solve. Second there are the hidden object games, where you need to find a list of objects in a single scene. And third, mahjong. Mahjong? Rather strange, as Caribbean piracy was already stopped by the time this Chinese tile game was created...I found the game addictive as you quickly pass puzzle by puzzle and the story line opens up.

I never needed to use the ""Hint"" button.Adding to the list of positive things are steam achievements, trading cards, a nice music score and zombie pirates.If I have any negative marks against the game, it is a little on the short side. There is a bonus adventure that allows you to continue where the main game ended, but it too is short. I also wish the protagonist's daughter had a name. I don't feel as invested when I think of ""HOLD ON! I'LL SAVE YOU.....WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS!"". Maybe I'm supposed to be a crappy parent who can't remember my kids name.Overall, it's enjoyable and if you feel the price is too high, wait for a Steam sale."

In fact, it's not devious at all, the puzzles are some of the easiest you'll find in an adventure game. There is some challenge to this, but not in a good way. Pixel hunting is the game's worst, but not only offense. Didn't know you could interact with the tiny little object that looks like it's just background? Hope you didn't waste too much time.Key objects often require you to complete an arbitrary game of tile matching Mah-Jong or an Eye-spy game. It makes no sense and if anything detracts from the atmosphere. Worse, these key objects JUST SPAWN in areas you had already visited, triggering after some event, with no logical reason for them appearing.The actual object rubbing that any adventure game fan is familiar with is incredibly straightforward and boring. The actual game play is just terrible.The story, atmosphere and graphics are admirable, and the voice acting i serviceable. CGI movies are a grainy mess but the backdrops are pretty.

It's nothing particular to this ""Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart"" game.  It's more of a recurring motif problem.  To wit, their Achievements combined with the inability to either save a game or just plain quit a game and start over.  In this case, I'd made my first run through on Casual and doing the HOGs.  So, I started up another run on Expert and was working on the Mahjong games in place of the HOGs.  About a quarter of the game in, I realized I'd just done a HOG instead of a Majong (i.e., I'd messed up the Achievement).  Without a way to restore a save or just quit and start over, I'd have to finish the entire game knowing I couldn't get the Achievement and restart another run.  No.  Not gonna happen.  So, I'm upset, frustrated, and uninstalling the game.Now, as to the game itself, it's a little below par for Artifex Mundi.  For some reason, it's a bit hard to see the objects in the HOGs.  Also, there are a lot of cases where you get stuck, only to realized that a HOG has popped up somewhere on the map that you'd otherwise have no reason to re-visit.  If a HOG re-activates like that, there should be a quest type of task that would take you back to the area to see the now-active HOG.  And, finally, the voice work (heck, even the role) of the protagonist's daughter is really annoying.Other than that, it's pretty much a standard Artifiex Mundi HOG (decent graphics, mostly tolerable voice acting, and reasonable puzzles).  I got about 3.6 hours out of my first run.  If I'd gone on to continue the last run, I'd probably have gotten about 5-1/2 to 6 hours of ""enjoyment"" out of it.  So, if you decide to buy it, I'd suggest getting it on sale."

Find-the-object is a bit more tricky because translations to other languages where probably made just with one of the acceptions of an english word and, they doesn't correspond to the real name of the object in other language. You should first figure out what was the english name to try to guess what the hell do you have to search in your own language. This is the only flaw I see in this game.If you go stuck, you can play Majhong instead and get the object or, you can just skip the mini-game and get the object.This and the fact that puzzles are straigth-logic, save lots of frustration often fell in other point-and-click adventure games."

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.That's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.They do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.My recommendation, because of the ""if you've played one you've played them all"" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games.

I found myself having to use the sonar feature fairly often because I couldn't distinguish one object from another, although it was never so bad that I had to use a hint.  I honestly preferred playing the mahjong.  The background locations were pretty, though.The point-and-click puzzles were mostly logical, although there was a lot of backtracking for what felt like very little payoff.  Also, I really hope you like collecting ingredients for recipes.The voice acting and music were decent, and there was even a bit of humor with the pirates on the ship.I was slightly disappointed with the bonus mission.  While the puzzles were pretty good, the spelling, grammar, and word choices were terrible: ""tukan"" instead of ""toucan,"" ""perl"" instead of ""pearl,"" ""wires"" instead of ""yarn with knitting needles""... it just got worse and worse.  I can overlook small mistakes, especially in bonus content, but some of the errors made finishing the hidden object games nearly impossible without resorting to sonar or hints.Overall, it is a decent little game.

The difficulty of both the hidden object scenes and other minigames is pretty good, neither too hard nor too easy. If you're stuck on a hidden object scene, you can choose to play mahjong instead. in the mahjong there are a few matches of different colour that takes away one HO item each, you can switch back and forth or just play either. There is however an achievement for both playing all mahjong games and finding all HO items without using hint, so an achievement completeist will have to play the game through twice. Luckily for that all conversation and cutscenes are skippable.All HO scenes are used more than once, and all found items are removed each time, making the 3rd go around pretty easy.The art is beautiful, the voice acting is good and the music and sound effects set a good haunted-pirate themed mood. The animations in the cutscenes is probably the worst part of the game; they get so bad it feels blurry.The story is very good, to save your daughter you have to find out what's going on with the pirate captain and you learn his story through collecting and handing in dubloons to the pirate's cute-creepy companion.There are maps available on both locations but they're useless as it only tells you where you are and cannot be used for teleporting or seeing if an area is cleared.Highly recommended for any fan of HOGs, pirates or really games in general."

,Recommended,259740,13814473,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,Coreplant,"This is well worth the buy! This game has an impressive amount of quality, and a few new twists on gameplay that I was very pleased to see! The story is enjoyable, and any romantic will be very pleased with the plot twists and turns we go through to reach the very satisfying ending.The gameplay is excellent and will not disappoint - well-constructed, enjoyable and steadily more complex Hidden Object scenes teamed with enjoyable puzzles and a robust hint system. As with many games in this genre, they make good (if not enough) use of a map to help navigate and figure out where you need to go next. The only bit of gameplay I think they could have improved on was the map itself, as there is no quick travel option.  Which makes sense in-game context, but still means quite a bit of traveling back and forth. Honestly my only quibble with the gameplay.Visually, it's stunning - the little bit of CG they use is well-done and matched to the artwork rather than trying to be realistic. A choice I applaud and definitely praise them for. The one bit of 'regular' CG is used for a deliberately creepy and eerie set of characters and was still a careful mix of realistic detail blended into the style of the art. The Hidden Object scenes were done in the art style of the game, not quickly patched from photos - the creators going that extra length always wins points with me. Very solid, consistent, and delightful visuals.Which just leaves audio, and this is a spot where the game falters just a wee bit - not in the music, but in the (mostly great) voice acting. Towards the end of the game, some lines are just not delivered well, or with odd inflection. Thankfully not by any of the major characters in the ending. The sound effects are minimal but spot on, but the music . . in full honesty it's mostly forgettably pleasant and appropriate for where you're hearing it. Nothing outstanding, but at least nothing that throws you out of the mood set by the game."

You can opt for a different type of puzzle instead of HOG, mahjong, but again pretty simple.The game does look nice and the plot is ok, although nobody is too phased by the whole dead pirate coming back to life!

I enjoy a good hidden title and that one is good with atmosphere and interesting plot.Beautifully drawn locations that make sense. The problem was the videos - when I watch them on full screen they are poor quality - fix that devs, please.The hidden objects mini games are well made, but I would prefer sth a bit more challenging, maybe a bit smaller items and more clutter in the screen (on hard difficulty). Mahjong alternative was a fun idea, though.A few typoes like harpun (harpoon) and one annoying mistake (says onion but should be garlic).All in all, well made game. Short (2 evenings of relaxed gaming) so the price should be no more than 5 euros.I'm gonna wait for further discounts (bundled titles would be welcomed) from this publisher.Dobra robota, rodacy :-)"
,Recommended,259740,18228236,"Posted: 27 September, 2015",all,Stray Cat,"I actually liked this one. HO games of this series tend to have the same features- a female protagonist- a somewhat bad voice acting- beautiful art- a kind-of-silly story.This, like all the others, has all of these features. While other titles (like Alice's Journey or Tales of Glass and Ink) are however dull, boring and feel too easy and lacking a decent storyline, this is one of the best of the series. The story actually has somekind of a sense with an ending that surprised me a little -which is way more than you can ask for with these games-, interesting minigames and the genuine ability to make you want to finish the game, which is not something that one should underestimate. Again, like all HO games it is not worth more than a couple pounds, and it should be bought when on discount. Other than that though, it is a very enjoyable couple of hours. Strongly Recommended, especially if one is -like me- weirdly drawn to this kind of games despite their silliness."

It's a good, entertaining game that, sadly, doesn't bring anything new to the genre.The worst part is the optional mahjong game. If you don't care about reshuffles it's ridiculously easy and virtually pointless. If you want to avoid reshuffles because you hunt achievements, you'll get destroyed by the puzzle generator that often creates puzzles that cannot be solved without reshuffling. That's a really bad game design."

There are also several difficulty levels that change how quickly the Hints and Skip recharge, if active ares are highlighted and how often, penalties for misclicking in the Hidden Object searches etc.All in all an entertaining few hours. My only gripe is that the cutscenes are extremly low res compared to the rest of the game and spoil the atmosphere with a fuzzy laggy cutscene.9/10 would play Pirate-themed Mahjong again!"

It's alright. i wish it was more hidden object scenes tho and maybe a bit better quality on the movie scenes.

The main character and daughter character were both boring which is why I was initially skeptical but the story of the pirate and his lover was not bad. I enjoyed how things were gradually revealed as time went on. However as things progressed I became even less interested in rescuing the daughter and more just interested in learning more of the pirates story. Voice acting was not the worst but could be better.The puzzles were of reasonable difficulty, I didn't use hints or skip any of them. However the hidden object scenes were a bit annoying in my opinion. Because of the colors used, objects blended in a little too much and required too much time to complete if you aren't using hints. However you have the option to skip these scenes and instead play a game of majong which was a nice change. The downside to this option is that to get 100% achievements you will need a minimum of 2 play throughs to play all the hidden object scenes and all the majong games. This is a bit annoying to me as I don't feel like these games are usually interesting enough to commit to a second playthrough. Even with skipping cut scenes the game is time consuming with a lot of back and forth to get items to progress.I spent around 4 hours for my first playthrough so with that in mind I would suggest you buy it on sale if you are only going to play it once.Overall though the game was enjoyable"
