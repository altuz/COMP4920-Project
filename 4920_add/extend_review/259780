Ended up playing it for more time than I thought I would. Kinda has a 10000000 progression feel to it which I enjoy. Seems like it will get pretty grindy at some point but that doesn't bother me. Also it seems people are hating because it was a freemium mobile game... that also doesn't bother me as the game I've played so far justifies the price.

I played it a fair bit right now and I enjoyed it but it seems a tad too grindy and finnicky in the way the conga line gets when it starts getting bigger with all the enemies on screen in the later levels.Still, not bad at all and fun in spurts to be sure. Getting the heroes maxed out at 3 stars takes far too long for my taste though."

I grabbed this game when it was on sale(currently still is at the time of writing) for $0.50, and its definitely worth the 5 bucks they are asking for it. For 50 cents its an absolute steal, a very fun time waster where you'll find some runs ending almost as quickly as they started. While others you'll see your hero snake grow into the double didgets, increasing the difficulty of dodging yet making it easier to slay enemies. Worth the asking price and I've had a lot of fun with it so far. Definitely a game for short bursts.Pros:-Simple yet fun gameplay-Nice customization-Easy to learn, yet difficult to fully master-New and interesting take on the snake genre-Can be played in short bursts or long runs, depeding on your interest-Nice soundtrackCons:-Mobile port, options menu is lacking severely-Simplistic art style-Heroes aren't unique, follow similar styles.Wait For A Sale"

Simple on the surface with a bit of depth underneath, such as your attack and movement strategies.I put about 5 hours into this game on my iPad before realizing it also made its way to Steam. I wouldn't say either format is preferable -- the swipe controls on the tablet of course are very suitable but the arrow keys (or joystick, or WASD) are just as spontaneous. I can't say the same for the mouse gestures though. Just a bit too much delay for it to be useful.On the down side, this port feels like a quick dump to PC as there's no graphics or window options, no achievements and no cloud save. I still recommend the game for someone looking for casual fun, it's just too bad NimbleBit couldn't have put a bit (groan) more effort into the port."

I wouldn't recommend you buy it at full price, but since I got it at 50c I'm not complaining at all.All Pay Shop mechanics have been removed, and the Coins (pay currency) drop frequently enough that I never found myself wishing for a new way to ""buy"" Coins. So it is fairly balanced in that aspect.The game has no end, so it's a classic ""Score"" game.Easiest to start with the mage until you get the engineer, at which point he's the best starter I found.Keep your Hero levels fairly even, and pour ALL your money into the Shop (outside of buying Coins).Have fun."

The objective is to kill a number of enemies to proceed to another stage. You grow your snake through picking up heroes. The more heroes you have the easier for you to kill the enemies, on the other hand, this also makes you more vulnerable to getting hit because the number of enemies increases after each stage.I liked the concept of this game having a more than a dozen of heroes, each having different attack patterns. Each of them are also upgradable to help you survive the game in later stages. Decent game best played on idle breaks."

You can spend 'tokens' to buy large boosts to damage, speed and health for runs through the game.  You can also spend them to continue your current run, but the cost doubles each time you do so, starting from one.  Tokens are rare drops, you get perhaps one every five levels.  So you're already stressed for tokens if you just use them as drops.  However, you can buy tokens for 'gems'.  Gems are your other ingame currency, which can be used to level up.At a certain point in the game you simply need to level up and use the boosts to progress.  And that means grinding.  Lots and lots of grinding.Now I'm not opposed to grinding in general.  After all, playing the game is why we're here, so being forced to play the game isn't bad, of itself.  The problem comes when you have to to a number of 'bad' runs without spending tokens on the boosts so that you can then do a good run in order to get to the next level and unlock the next character.So it's a nice idea, it's a nice game, but you can smell the scent of addiction mechanics all over it.  And it just isn't a good thing.Nimble quest.  Worth your money, but not your time."

,Recommended,259780,8491372,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,indievoyagerob,"This review is a difficult one to write. I enjoyed playing it to a point, but it appears that much like a Premium title doesn' translate well to an IAP model, the reverse is also true.The primary reason I enjoy the game was because I want to see more like it. I enjoy the creative twist on the Snake genre, and this game makes huge strides towards that end. Where it fails was the transition from IAP to Premium game. You find very quickly that the limited leveling system takes AGES. I've probably played this game for over 20 hours (most of my logged time was just having the game on while I did other stuff), and haven't yet finished leveling up all my characters.This would be fine if the game content were showing me progress as I grind but its not. The same 8 or so levels repeat endlessly, just getting more and more difficult with each run through. So, it's up to you how you define ""completing"" the game. I'm sick of just playing through the same levels over and over again, and will be stopping my progress now, retiring the title in my library.If you liked Snake, this title is definitely worthwhile and you can probably get a few hours of enjoyment out of it. But there are other, deeper, titles out there that are probably more worth your gaming dime. If a sequel is coming, I'd wait for that."

You automatically move and have to avoid enemies and obstacles as well as your own companions.You'll attack enemies automatically once you're within range. The type of attack depends on the hero you chose.From time to time you'll find more heroes to join your queue, up until you'll have a queue of 6 heros. (Update: You actually get a chance to upgrade this limit)The enemies get harder the further your get and they start getting good attacks as well, so you have to plan your movement well so you don't touch anything or get hit by their attacks while still getting in a good position for your heroes to attack.There are powerups that are dropped by enemies and you can upgrade these and your heroes with gems that you find in the game. You can also buy little buffs to help you out.Overall, this is a really nice game. It's fun, not too hard, and not too complicated. Really good if you have a little time to kill.Though I think it's better to play this game in small portions, since the gameplay is not that deep, otherwise you might get bored with it."

,Recommended,259780,12579326,"Posted: 20 October, 2014",all,Flying Shisno,"I had this game on my phone, and put around a dozen hours into it and never got close to bored, and wasn't even mad/upset when I had to start over for the PC versionThis is the classic Snake game with a twist. Instead of a 'snake' that get's longer when you eat a pellet, you're an adventurer/warrior, and the 'pellets' which drop fair rate are warriors that you collect and 'add' to your party. Your adventurer, and you party both attack the various enemies that run around the levels.Each warrior is unique in their appearance, stats, and the way they attack sometimes. The Mage is squishy but hurls powerful fireballs. The Knight has a lot of health, damage, and armor, but attacks at a somewhat slow rate. The 'Gizmo' is a little dude with goggles that hurlsverypowerful bombs with a large radius at averyslow rate.Each warrior can be 'leveled up' 3 times, each level giving new stat increases or sometimes even benefits. The Knights first level increases his attack speed, while his second and third levels increase his armor, which makes him very difficult to kill unless you decide it would be great to punch that 30 foot ogre with your face.There are about 7 different arenas for you to progress through. You start in a forest, go on to a sewer, etc. When you reach the final area type and beat it, it loops back to the first forest, though the difficulty increases continue. And while I never done it before, I believe beating the final area the second time 'wins' you the game.Each time you beat a level for the first time(including the second trip levels), you unlock a new character. All characters you unlock can be picked up and added to your party during the game, so your 'length' get's quite long. For example, if you have 5 characters unlocked, your line can only get 5 long, and you continue to battle through the levels. If you only have 2 characters, then the line will only be 2 characters max. There's a total of 16 characters, which equates quite a long line if you can keep them all alive, and each one of them has a unique attack to add to your parties killing machine prowess.Along with the characters and their 3 levels, there are power-ups that defeated enemies drop, and they do temporary effects like giving your a damage shield, freezing all enemies for 5 seconds, increasing attack speed for 30 seconds, replenishing health, etc. You can upgrade these items multiple times, 10 times I think, and each time increases its potency/length/radius depending on the item.All in all, this is an amazingly fun game that I believe all should play. If you ever loved the classic Snake game, then this is absolutely a must buy even if you are bored with the original. I got this on a sale where it cost $0.50, but I would happily pay the full $5 for this great game."

It's casual- take Snake and put some light RPG elements in the mix, dress it up.. bam, Nimble Quest. Don't expect it to be anything else and you'll come out content.Do you like getting upgrades? Seeing how far you can get, then trying to get a bit further? You'll enjoy this game. There's 16 different Heroes- you start with one. Beat level 1 and you unlock the second hero, beat level 2 and you unlock the third hero, etc.I said it's like Snake, and it is. Instead of growing each time you get an apple (or whatever it was for that game), sometimes killing enemies will give you a hero that will join your conga line- only heroes you've unlocked can join you, so the more you unlock the longer your line can be and thus the more damage you can do and longer you can live.Additionally, enemies will drop gems (currency) or pickups such as a bomb that will kill all the enemies in a certain radius when you pick it up or an ice crystal that will freeze all the enemies in the game area in place for a certain time which will allow you to murderize them with impunity.Each hero has 3 upgrade levels: when you start a game you choose a leader. Getting kills will give the leader hero experience, and you'll level them that way, or you can spend the money you earn to level them faster. Each hero gets a specific buff at each level (they might shoot faster, hit harder, get more armor, root enemies with each attack, etc), and each one is noticeable. It's not like ""oh I got this guy to the next level, cool.."", you see them do more damage or live longer.Additionally, you can spend the money on upgrading the pick-ups that enemies will drop- just a tip, do this first before you spend any money on levelling a hero. It's just much better to get that done first.This is a fairly rambling review, but the game is absolutely wonderful especially at a $5 asking price. The only problem I have with it is that there are no achievements, but depending on your stance that may not matter in the slightest."

The options menu has only; sound on/off, music on/off and tutorial on/off. So make sure your screen can handle 720p because that is what the game is looked at. You can't run it in full-screen or rebind the controls (only arrow keys and WASD) because that will ruin the idle way of playing the game through the developer's eyes.Shame on you Nimble Bit!It does have support for the Logitech F710 out of the box, so that is something nice I guess.The game-play is simple, but punishingly hard, after two hours of playing I only got to “castle 1” which is the fifth level out of 14? The problem is that the enemies have too much HP so I can't kill them fast enough until the whole map is swarming with them and I just die.It is possible to level up the heroes, but that too takes ages to do because of how little experience point they gain each kill. It is possible to bypass it with gems (in game currency), but it costs a lot. They have three levels each, which will increase attack speed, strength, range or add a special passive ability like HP drain or stun.The levels are not that big so it's a bit annoying that the game can't be set to a higher resolution so the whole level can be viewed at once. Therefore, it is very easy to walk into enemy archers or mages and end up dying because they can't be seen.You can continue form where you died, but it costs a special coin to do so. Which you can gain as a random drop or buy them in the shop for 1000 gems each. The gems can also be used to upgrade the heroes if you don't want to grind for enemy's over and over. It costs 1000 gems the first level and 10.000 gems for level two, don't know what it is for level three since I only have played it for about two hours.  You can also buy increased time for some of the item the emery's drop at random at the shop for 320 first tier, 720 for second tier, 1520 for third tier, and 2530 for fourth tier, and the last and fifth tier I don't know. (the prices may be off, but you get the idea of how they increase.) I got around 1000 – 1300 gems (depended on how many chests-drop I got) before the fifth level and died.So you are better off starting from level one and using the coins in the arena or buffs before a level. The arena it's a 24hour, one life, clan war fight. You have to have gotten to “courtyard 1” before you can enter and spend your coins on it, then you can choose a clan to join or make a new one by typing it in the box that shows up. The arena is a one life, daily challenge, where you get one random hero to use.+ It looks OK.+ The fonts and menus looks nice a bit big maybe.+ Supports Logitech F710, bought joystick and directional keys.+ Has 16 characters to choose from, must be unlocked.+ Has 14 levels.+ Don't take too long to beat a level.- Don't have a resolution option, so it is stuck at 720p.- Can't set it to full-screen, so it's stuck in window mode.- Can't rebind the keys, only arrow keys or WASD for movement.- Slow to progress further into the game.- Slow to level up the heroes.- Has a special coin for continuing and arena mode.- Pickups only works on the first hero, making the shield useless.- Game never told me if the upgrades works on the heroes you add to the line.Running on version 1.0.8I cannot recommend this weird snake clone because of how slow the game is."

Yeah, but only if you don't have to do the same thing all over and over and over again.You can upgrade the heroes, which is nice. But if you lose, you have to pay tokens to continue where you left. If you run out of tokens, you need to buy some with gems. At the same time, you're trying to level up a hero, but you can't because you just spent your all gems to tokens!I don't like the idea that this was made for a computer. This kind of a game belongs to your smartphone, to play while in recess, or when youre bored.If this game was sold in the Google Play Store and called ""RPG-like Snake 2.0"", it would have been better, and felt better to play.Someone might enjoy this, but I'm not on that list."

I could be wrong, but it seemed to me to be identical in terms of gameplay.I do endorse picking up this game, but just get it for free on iOS or Android. There's no reason to drop five bucks on it, here."
,Recommended,259780,12659669,"Posted: 27 October, 2014",all,Locke,"As should be fairly apparent at first glance, Nimble Quest is a re-imagining of Snake, only instead of the focus being on collecting pellets and avoiding your own ever-growing body, for the most part your body remains at a manageable size and the object of the game is to skillfully avoid enemies while coming close enough to get them in range of your attacks.The game is originally from mobile devices, and to a degree it shows. Options are minimal, barely acceptable. UI is clearly designed for touch and though functional with a controller, really works better with a mouse. As a personal preference I prefer a d-pad for the game itself, though I'm sure the keyboard works just fine. It also has mouse controls that mimic the touch controls from phones.The gameplay is pretty dull at first, to be honest. Playing it for than fifteen minutes at time before boredom sets in is impossible. The game was clearly designed as a grindfest. However, once you've done that grind, gotten your upgrades, and worked your way to the higher levels, the game becomes far more enjoyable. The levels are hectic and engaging, with enemies galore and items all over the screen, a far cry from the more sparse environments of earlier levels. Your line of heroes should be longer at this point as well, meaning you need to pay more attention to your own movements to avoid running into yourself. All the same elements are present, but the increase in the amount of things you need to process keeps you from just sitting and staring at the screen and lets you get immersed in split-second reactions. It's a great experience and a shame it's hiding behind the dull grind that may scare people off before they ever see the more interesting later levels. If you do wish to cut right to the chase and get to the good stuff though,it's a fairly simple registry edit(as far as messing with your registry goes, anyway, which isn't for everyone), and I wouldn't really blame you if you wanted to go ahead and skip the grind.All in all, the game's got a good set of underlying mechanics hidden behind some unfortunate vestiges of mobile design. On sale though it's hard not to recommend, especially at the $0.49 I paid for it (and card sales bring that number down even further). If you're looking for a fast-paced arcade action game, this one does a pretty good job of it."

How this changes the snake concept is that each hero comes with his (or hers) own attack, so depending on who's in your line, and for that matter where they are in that line, you could find yourself changing up your strategy.If you have Gizmo (bomb throwing) and the two spellcasters, then you might be maneuvering your snake for broadsides.If you have a Merida the archer and Boomy the sniper then running at the enemy might work better.A bunch of melee combattants may make you try to sidle up next to the enemy formations (usually 3-unit snakes) to let the swordsmen get in their strikes.There's been some discussion about the price of this game, considering that the mobile version is free, but the in-game purchase of the red gems (an unlock that can only be done with cash for $3.99, and seriously lessens the grind because of their value in the game)  is included at the start of this game.

The gameplay is addictive. Graphics and sound serve their purpose. There's no gear, but in addition to character leveling, there are permanent over-all upgrades and per-game buffs that can be purchased with in-game currency. When you die you go back to the beginning, but character level and upgrades are permanent. (Continues and level skips can also be bought with coins.)The original mobile version was free,, but had in-game purchases, whereas this version is $5 with no in-game purchases. Apparently, the game was not re-balanced because of this change, which makes the game a little grindy. But personally, I like it. Levelling and upgrading are very gratifyinig when it only comes with lots of gametime and good strategy. I think these changes make it much more what one would expect from a PC game, compared to the original model. Not having in-game purchases makes a game seem more legitimate to me, and I don't mind paying 5 dollars for that feeling of legitimacy."

You start with a few heroes and each have different attacks. You pick your leader and join the fight against the various creatures the game has to offer.

As you go through the level your heroes will get hit and eventually die like you. However the game only ends if the leader dies (the hero you start with).Overall i think the game is fun for a few minutes and then it'll just be boring. You're basically forced to upgrade your heroes to beat the levels and you can only do that if you kill X amount of monsters with the leader (10k monsters for level 2 which is A LOT!) OR get enough gems in a SINGLE run to level up a certain hero. I haven't played the mobile version but i'm sure the tokens act as a P2W thing which you need to buy with real money. That doesn't happen in the PC version but they are very hard to get. Tokens give you powerful bonuses that turn the game into an easy mode pretty much.I'm going to recommend this but it's pretty boring after a while and the only thing unique about it is it being a snake game."

Nimble Quest shows how you can get high mileage out of a simple premise and an excellent execution. Even the controls and power-ups feel fluid and satisfying, rewarding precision play but giving the player a lot of ""wiggle"" room to nab those power-ups close to a wall or in the middle of a horde of enemies."

I go to this game when i want a quick game to play. The idea of having character variations with differing skills is interesting and adds a new element to an old style.  If this goes on sale i recommend it if you just want to play a game for a few minutes at a time.

I will say though Nimble Quest is a fun game and it brings back some nostalgia from the old mobile game snake I sank hours into snake when I was younger. I load up this game when I'm waiting for a dungeon in WoW or Rift or when I just wanna play something quick and simple. All in all I would say out of 10 I would personally give the game a 7/10 if it is on sale as for the non-sale price I would say it is a bit to high but on the plus side there is no in-game store to have you spend even more money.

,Recommended,259780,12847077,"Posted: 8 November, 2014",all,LeQuack100,"Basically, it's Snake with guns and it's good.Before I started playing, I wasn't expecting much (it's obviously a port of an Android/iOS mobile game, so nobody would reasonably expect great things).  To my surprise, this title is great fun and I've found myself wandering back to it time and again.I won't bother to describe the basic gameplay, as everyone's already done so and it's exactly what you'd expect.  There is a bit more strategy to the game later on.  The non-upgraded characters are mostly fairly similar in terms of usability and only when fully powered-up reveal their respective strengths in play, with previously-entirely-unwanted healers and freezers becoming surprisingly useful as leads.The game is not without fault: collecting the sizeable numbers of gems needed to upgrade all characters to level three and complete the last levels is taking a very long time.  I assume this reflects the pay-to-play nature of the original, but these character upgrade costs definitely need to be reduced for the desktop game.  On the plus-side, as grindy as it is, I'm still enjoying just playing towards the finish, as much as I would have liked to get there sooner.The developer is NimbleBit, although they're strangely shy about putting their name on Steam.  This seems to be the only thing they've ported so far.  I hope we see more of their work in future and I hope especially for a bigger, better sequel to Nimble Quest, which very much deserves it.On the whole, this is very much an underrated title - I recommend it highly to anyone who appreciates this kind of old-school gameplay.  Kudos to NimbleBit, for creating a game that is far better than its humble mobile origins would suggest."

Progress in unlocking things is fast at first but then slows to a crawl, where you may need many repetitive runs to buy one of the remaining character upgrades.  Presentation is pretty good: Cute pixel art, and above average soundtrack (I like that one of the synth instruments sounds like the title music from Etrian Odyssey 2...).  I'd recommend Cladun X2 instead - it's also grindy, but has a lot more game mechanics and variety."
