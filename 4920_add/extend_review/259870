Sadly a huge disappointment as a game.The comic strips explaining the story are lovely, very nice art style.The main problem with it, aside from the poor amount of gameplay, is that it's an obvious tablet game not made for a desktop computer. The developers really need to redesign or at the very least resize the UI and other elements to fit for a desktop game.Barely worth the $2 I paid for it."

Under normal circumstances, this would make clearing the streets of drooling beings rather simple, but this is video gaming we're talking about. Since when is anything straightforward?With all but one of your team having been wiped out, you arrive at the epicenter of the outbreak inexplicably short of ammunition. What this means, soldier, is that you have three bullets to deal with the undead horde, and have to set off chain reactions to rid the streets of this menace.Not all zombies are created equal, and some have more explosive energy, while others loose off a few rounds of their firearm in their death throes.The upshot of a good performance is money, and once you've got enough of the stuff you can set about buying upgrades that, for example, give you more bullets or inflict more damage. Others, meanwhile, grant you more explosive zombies, or increase the radius of their acidic ooze, which generally makes it easier to make a big bloody mess.All of this adds up to a monstrously addictive quick-fire affair that utterly nails what on-the-go handheld gaming should be about."
,Recommended,259870,16780875,"Posted: 29 June, 2015",all,ownosourus,"OMG Zombies! is a puzzle game where the idea is to create chains of exploding zombies by firing your weapon at them. Each zombie has a different ability that has a different effect on the chain. Players need to work out the positioning of the zombies, the type of zombies in the level, the layout of the level and the upgrades they may have earned to create the largest chain possible and hopefully rid each level of 100% of zombies.The concept whilst solid does leave a little to luck as well as judgement. The biggest frustration is that a level will have a slightly different layout of where zombies are, so there is no way to work out the best possible combination of shots across various attempts. This means that whilst aiming in the same area may clear 55% of zombies in one go, the next time it may clear 91% it adds an element of randomness that does away with the puzzle element somewhat. That said, it is a minor frustration and replaying levels doesn’t tend to bother you, as you’ll soon find you have lost a lot of time whilst trying to clear each level.Depending on how well you do on each level, you are awarded with a bronze, silver or gold medal and a cash prize. Medals earned open up new levels and money can be used to buy upgrades. The upgrades really work well in OMG Zombies too, as not only can you upgrade your weapon, to give effects such as more power, but you can also upgrade barrels so the explosions are greater and affect more zombies. You can also upgrade the various zombie types so that their abilities have better effects.There are loads of levels each with slightly different themes and layouts, so despite the simplicity of the concept there are a good few hours of gameplay here, especially if you plan on getting 100% on each level. Doing so isn’t easy either, as there will be times when you’ll hit a massive chain, have two bullets left, but have three zombies to kill who are not even close to each other.Overall OMG Zombies is a fun little time waster. Despite the randomness of layouts on levels, when you hit a mammoth chain the feeling is great. The fresh undead types and overhauled visuals will offer something new for seasoned slayers, while the sheer satisfaction of the core gameplay loop will delight newcomers."

,Recommended,259870,21518770,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,Gamephasis,"I have to admit…. I wasn’t entirely thrilled to feature another apparent mindless zombie game on Steamified. The genre has been done to absolute death – pun semi intended. Then I saw the entire first page of reviews were thumbs down (at least to me) and I thought “Oh, great… Here we go again.” For someone who really tries not to go into any game to be featured on Steamified without too many preconceptions I knew that I was going to be full of them this time around. And yes, I had heard of the game prior to the creation of the site.The game starts with a comic book style presentation that introduces the game, its story, characters and the setting. It’s actually pretty neat and a very nice touch. It certainly immerses you into the game in a smart manner. The action then gets underway and we discover a game that is easy to learn and pretty difficult to master until you’re very comfortable with how the plethora of different zombie types splatter. The object with each shot is to create the greatest chain reaction. Every zombie that you kill does a different thing upon death. For example, you might have a police zombie that will fire bullet(s) in different directions and for each bullet that hits another zombie will cause that zombie to perform its splatter pattern which may be creating a pool of zombie matter that destroys every other zombie that touches it, etc. In order to advance further into the game you need to kill a certain percentage of zombies on each level.Thankfully to aide your zombie killing spree there are upgrades. Each level that you successfully complete will give you a reward in the form of cash that you can spend on getting upgrades. You can upgrade your weapons or you can upgrade the different zombies and have their damage increase over total damage, time, distance or even increase their population, Upgrading your weapons allows you to even have more bullets at your disposal. It’s a good upgrade system and one in which you will have to strategically plan for which upgrades will benefit your playstyle the most.I really enjoyed the time that I spent with OMG Zombies! It’s not the greatest game in the world but it’s certainly one where given it’s level structure you can spend a few minutes just firing away on zombies and have a bit of relaxing fun over a short period. In that respect it’s a pretty solid game. It achieves what it sets out to achieve and on that basis I can recommend it.For similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visithttp://www.steamified.com/For our Steam group and curation please joinhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified"

,Recommended,259870,9198626,"Posted: 20 February, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"OMG Zombies lets you play a cop that has to get rid of all the zombies in a level. And it wants you to do this as efficiently as possible. Your bullets ricochet off of zombies and the zombies that get hit will explode or emit lightning, or shoot bullets, for example, killing other zombies in the process. So it involves some strategy, but also luck, because the zombies walk around freely. This makes it hard to hit enough other zombies sometimes.There are 100 levels in total and each one rewards you with a medal and money. Money that can be spent on upgrading your gun or zombies (that's right, you can upgrade the zombies; awesome !). You can choose to upgrade your zombies so that bullets from cop zombies will hit more zombies, or that explosions will be bigger and timers will be extended. Your choice. In the end you need to update them all if you want to platinum every level.And even though there 100 levels, most of them can be finished within minutes. So completing the game will take just a few hours.The graphics aren't the best in the world. In fact, I wasn't impressed by them at all. The 2D artwork isn't all that attractive, and the levels are too crudely drawn, as are the zombies. The animations for the zombies are also fairly basic.But graphics is not what this game is all about. It's all about the kills. And it feels very satisfying to kill all of the zombies with just one bullet, or see that last bullet kill the last couple of enemies.OMG Zombies is a game I'd definitely recommend, even if you had enough of all these zombie games lately. This one is worth it, absolutely.[Rating: 80/100]"

Games with chain reactions can be very nice to play, but you shouldn't waste money on this one. There are way, way better similar zombie games and I was expecting OMG Zombies! to be even better than one of the best out there: Infectionator Dominator (which is free!!).It is boring way too quickly as there isn't much progression. What's the goal of the game? Escape the zombies. But most of the time, you fail and die in various ways, until finding the happy ending.Each level is much the same and most levels are beaten just by sheer luck. Somtimes you use all of your bullets not even getting 50%, even if you wait and wait for the perfect shots. One the next try, you can finish the level Platinum with 1 bullet.Of course you can upgrade your character and yes, you can upgrade your zombies. Seriously? Isn't this the other way around?Upgrading can only be done in a forced order. Sometimes you have to buy an expensive upgrade, you really don't need, to get to the one that is useful.The game really is missing the option to buy extras, like bombs, grenades, air support, ground support! Every level ends with you waving to the helicopter to pick you up. Every ending is about a helicopter that picks you up. If you don't get any support of this helicopter, why bother to get out in the first place?Although still determined to finish the game Prestige, I couldn't even be bothered to unlock all the levels before deleting this game in the end."

As one explodes it will cause others nearby to do the same thus causing a very satisfying chain reaction. With careful consideration, a good aim and a bit of luck it is possible to clear the whole screen with one shot.Adding to the game there are also different types of zombie that will react differently upon there expiration. Police zombies will fire a single shot across the screen, bloaters explode, corrosive zombies leave a pool of acid behind, soldiers fire bullets which ricochet and so on.A well placed shot which obliterates all the zombies feels absolutely gratifying. There is an element of luck involved due to the random placement of enemies but, this does not stopOMG Zombiesfrom being any less addictive.

,Recommended,259870,12428902,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,Twistor,"First of all, OMG Zombies! is a puzzle game. A bit crazy, random-generated, puzzle game where winning is based on a well-calculated and timed click and the ensuing chaos. Your success is ultimately dictated on that crucial first click and statistics. Oh, and there are a lot of zombies too.That tickles your interest? Basically, in each level you find yourself somewhere high, surrounded by zombies and with limited ammunition. Each zombie has a special power triggered on their death, like explosion or acid pool or shooting a weapon. With just a few bullets, you have to kill as many zombies as possible, preferably all of them.This is difficult at first. Then you begin to see patterns within the horde and also accumulate money from winning levels, so it gets easier as you can upgrade your weapon and the zombies. It's left unclear how the zombies can be made stronger, but somehow that happens when you pump enough money in them. Whatever really, as it surely is surprisingly addictive. Several times I decided that the next level would be the last but then kept on playing regardless.There's also a story. No, it's not very detailed or good, but it explains where the zombies came from and why you find yourself in this dire situation. Also, it's told in an artsy comic manner, so it's cool and it works well for this game. The whole game is drawn in greyscale, except the blood that's (you guessed it) red and everywhere. The unique style works well. Sounds are repetitive and uninteresting, but the cacophony of them can be amusing when you pull a great combo.For me it lasted 8 hours for the first playthrough (100% completion until first prestige). That brings me to the one thing that kind of bugs me: there's a bad case of ""that achievement"" in this game, as to earn the last achievement you have to (you get to?) beat the game completely (100%) 20 times. That's going to take a while (UPDATE: I finally beat it after almost 2 years real time, 88 hours gametime). I'd recommend the game regardless as it's cheap and fun. It's also a good game to go to when you're waiting for something but only got a few minutes to spare as it's fast to play through just a few levels."

You can only hope that the random positioned zombies and random positioned explosive barrels will trigger a reaction between them, and that the zombies that randomly shoot when killed will hit the right random zombie that randomly will shhot again... and so on... you can buy upgrades to have more bullets, more range for exploding barrels and zombies, more damage etc... in the end it gives me no sense of accomplishment, and the levels that are hard to complete with a platinum medal are hard for all the wrong reasons, your skill will not influence the outcome in any way.

,Recommended,259870,9113087,"Posted: 14 February, 2014",all,CriticalComposer,"OMG Zombies is a great example of a fun puzzle game that was ported poorly. I have played this game to completion(Platinum Medal on all levels) on both the Playstion Mini version and the Playstation Mobile version. The PC version is practically the same game but with 3 new zombies thrown into them mix. The core of the game is shooting a zombie in hopes that its ""power"", or death action, ends up killing the zombies next to it. With practice and a little bit of luck(a lot of luck at the beginning) you'll be creating huge domino effect chain reactions using a single bullet. Points are earned at the end of each level that are used to ""upgrade"" the zombies or your rifle. Upgrades consist of increased range of power, increased damage of power, or a larger population of that zombie on the map(this is good as it creates more opperatunities for the chain reactions). There is something great about clearing an entire map with one well placed shot.The issue with the port is the GUI, both for the menus and the gameplay. The entire game seems to have been ported line for line from the Vita version, which is touch heavy. Unfortunately, the HUD is sized for a portable system(leading to buttons that are way too large for a PC) and the level select screen is navigated by dragging, a feat that isn't exactly natural for the mouse. Hopefully Laughing Jackal sees this an works towards creating better menus and HUD for the PC crowd. Other than this slight oversight(seeing as the game is still extremely fun and rewarding) this game is well worth the $4 that it launched at."

Don't let the votes fool you.GeneralWhat can I say? OMG Zombies! is an addictive game until you reach Prestige level 1. Play dominos with Zombies by watching them explode, shoot other zombies, scream (causes wide spread damage) and other crazy effects. You start off as an officer that appears to have gotten himself into a bit of a pickle. The way for him to survive is to down as many zombies as he can to proceed to the next areas in your journey.Although you don't lose any health and you have no health for that matter makes the game too easy. You're basically on top of objects in the game, sniping zombies to try and cause a massive widespread train wreck. At first you only have 3 bullets, but upgrading let's you increase your clip size. The upgrade system is pretty fluid. Upgrade zombies, barrels or your own weapon.AnnoyanceThe in-game comic that spams is quite annoying since it spams after every game at 80-100 levels. Don't get me wrong, you can skip it. It would be better if it showed different comics but it doesn't until every 10 or so levels completed (as far as I remember).OverallDo I recommend this? Well, if you want to waste a bit of time it might be worth playing as a time waster or if you just want to farm achievements it might be worth it (beware of 20th prestiege achievement). However, if you're looking for a game to play well over 30hrs, OMG Zombies! isn't that.Rating: 4/10"

Some explode, some shoot guns in the direction they're facing or leave pools of acid behind.It's a very mellow game, either good for a ""5 minute bash"" or a dedicated achievement gathering session.

,Recommended,259870,16043791,"Posted: 28 May, 2015",all,Abhorrent_Anger,"Unexpectedly fun casual puzzle game. The gameplay consists of a rather simple point and click control mechanic, where the goal is to create chain reactions of violently dying zombies. The levels are made of varying types of randomly spawned zombies placed within a rather open arena artificially inhibited by obstacles. The goal is to clear as many of them as possible with the limited ammo and properties said zombies have. Additionally, there are upgrade paths which enhance favourable characteristics of the enemies and the player for easier perfect completions of levels.Since it's a PC port from a mobile platform, the on-screen menu system is a bit awkward, and the graphics look like they're from pre-millennium era, which would have been forgivable as a stylistic choice, but most likely is a side effect of poor upscaling.Replayability-wise, getting 100% on all 100 levels amounts to about 6h-10h of playtime, including replaying some of the stages after getting all of the upgrades. However, the achievement suggesting fully finishing the game for 20 times is down-right ridiculous.All in all, considering the game has trading cards, it's worth picking up for it's addicting gameplay and relatively cheap price, especially if it's on a sale."

So to set it more clearly:There is only limited bullets with which to try and kill as many zombies as possible on the level by setting of chain reactions. There's different zombies that each does something different when killed. The zombies move around alot, so you must time the shot perfectly while also considering what zombie to shoot.For example the normal zombie will only explode when shot, damaging other zombies around it. Not all zombies explode, based on what the other zombies are they will either explode if a normal zombie, melt and create a shortly timed acid pool, fire a bullet in the direction they're facing, or run and explode when they collide with something. These are only half the different zombies and as can be seen you must also take into account the facing of the zombies. As the levels get harder the zombies get more health, so it's better to shoot a weak zombie and have it's effect chain to other zombies.There's also upgrades that allows you to increase your ammo and the potency of zombies when killed. So this makes for a very fun little game where you must think before you act, time it perfectly and try to kill as many zombies as possible with the limited ammo.The levels are short and fun and alot of replay value as you buy upgrades and try to reach the 100% zombies killed mark!"

I welcome the challenge though. Any game that exercises my brain in a fun way is fine by me.Storyline is plausible as well. There's a plant that explodes and if it does, whatever it explodes near r on, becomes infected. Scientists discovered and were trying to do away with it but... well, just watch the intro short to know how everyone one wound up. It's much more exciting than me explaining it. Anyway, you are assgned the task of killing zombies with x amount of bullets to hopefully produce a chain reaction of death. There are different zombie types that help you create death chain which means you have to strategize who to shoot. Do you shoot the Soldier zombie who can shoot its gun a few times in different, random directions? Perhaps the Runner who will run and then explode? Maybe the zombie that when shot, turns into a puddle of acid? Depending on the level you can have all these, some of these, none of these or these plus more.There's also an upgrade system. Want more bullets? Want zombies you shoot to do more damage? Earn cash by clearing levels satisfatorily (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and buy the upgrades you want.It's a great little game and I highly reccommend it.

Pound through each mission with a couple tries and when you get stuck on the tree, go back down to levels you have upgraded zombies on.  Upgrade based on current need for firepower and previous need for populations."

,Recommended,259870,22789743,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,Lacie,"Not a bad zombie game that is a bit strategy (although I would like to point out a LOT of luck is involved :/ ). However, I'd rather wish there was a ""maybe"" recommendation. On one hand, I liked the game because I just HAD to get the dang gold medals. I also liked that it is a simple (yet frustratingly) easy game (that may take HOURS and HOURS to beat). On the other hand, there is a lot of work to go through getting the final achievement in this game. A LOT of repetition and failures. It is not fun. I wouldn't mind it so much if the requirement for it wasn't so high, but it's just a pain...However, like I said, it's not a bad zombie game. If you can get it cheap (or free), I'd say go for it. However, I don't recommend buying it for full price. Also, be aware that MANY hours are required to get all the achievements (unless you cheat)."

However, if you want to have a fun time and get all the achievements done, I would not recommend this game.In this game, you shoot exploding zombies to make a chain reaction with three to six bullets in a level.  There are 100 levels and they can be quite tough to beat if you make mistakes in upgrading on zombies, explosive barrels or your rifle.The idea of the game could be fun, but the current game is not because of the fact it almost depends on your luck, not on your skill.  It seems all the settings (starting locations of zombies and exploding barrels, moving directions and duration of zombies, and so on) depends on randomness, and the player cannot control this randomness at all, except to choose retry.  You will have to try around 15 times (in average) to eliminate all the zombies in a level.  If you prefer fulfilling achievements, you have to repeat beating all the levels 21 times.  It is a long journey of rather just throwing a dice so many times, not challenging your skills. There is a seldom chance of joy in watching your careful one shot resulting in a complete massacre of zombies.There should be some modification to allow players to apply their skills; a bait, a yelling, barrels located more dispersed (or designed), environmental kills (falling obstacles to kill zombies and limit their movements afterwards), or zombie attributes attracting other zombies."

It's very well drawn.You can play this Fullscreen or Window mode with many resolution sizes!You can slide the music and sound volume.You can play this with keyboard and/or mouse. Al though i do not recommend keyboard at all.About the game.You have to shoot on a zombie, the zombie will die and they will have a dead animation. Each animation depends on the zombie, So if there is a cop zombie, he will shoot a bullet. if there is a civilian, he will just die, if there is a runner, well i think he will run first and then explode around him.  There are medals in the game ""Bronze, Silver, Gold and platinum"". The more zombies you are to kill the better your chances are to get a medal. A higher medal will also unlock more levels and a more cash.You will need cash to upgrade your stats. Like doing more damage, more ammo, Zombie does more damage, Bigger radius, effect last longer and so go on..There is a Civilian zombie, who just explodes in a small radius with relative high damage.There is a Bloat zombie, Who explodes with mininum damage but high radius.Thre is a Cop zombie, Who shoot 1 straight bullet (Will be penetrate after upgrades).There is a soldier zombie, Who shoots randomly a bullet in any direction infront of him (after upgrades the bullets will bounce and shoot more bullets)There is a Bilious Zombie, That drops a pool of small acid on the ground.There is a Mortar Zombie, That shoot his brain and lands randomly on the level and damage nearby other zombies.There is a Runner zombie, That charges into a straight forward line and after some moment, It explodes and damage nearby zombies.There is a Zapper zombie, that shoots an electric Straight line in a random direction, Once hit against an other zombie the straight line will be there for awhile. The zombie is dead no matter how high his health and if any other zombie touches the Electric straight line they will take damage.There are Explosive barrels, Once destroyed by you or a certain zombie, all zombies nearby will catch on fire and maybe will burn to death.Other things.IF YOU ARE AN ACHIEVEMENT HUNTER, PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THE GAME: There is one annoying achievement where you have to beat the game 20 times 100%!and there are 100 levels. Which means you will all the levels at least 2000. but you should easily double this to 4000, because at early stages you can't get a level on 100%. Not without enough upgrades. If you do want to get this achievement, prepare yourself by wasting more then 150 hours into this game AT LEAST.The best way to get fast money is going all the way to the top with the pyramid, Even if you can't complete this in gold or higher. You still get money and top levels are easier then the ones at the bottom.I Find Level 64 the most hardest and annoyiest level in the game.Upgrading the eletric zombie is not really important, So try to upgrade this the last.I had sometimes, that i am clicking on the wrong zombie with the first bullet and this turns out to be a success! So do not restart the level too quickly if you miss click! It could be that bullet!I Give this game a 7/10"

,Not Recommended,259870,33801302,Posted: 25 July,all,somnomania,"This is a fun game, and once you've figured out the way each type of zombie works, it's not hard to figure out what you need to do in each level. The blood spatters and chain reactions are incredibly satisfying, and the upgrade system is self-explanatory. My only complaint is that, if you're a perfectionist with achievements, the one for prestiging 20 times is a bit of a bear. I've got almost 49 hours of play time, and I think I've prestiged... five times? Six? There's no way to tell how many times you've done it, as far as I can find, either. And it's not like each time you prestige it gets more challenging; it's just the same stuff all over again, clearing levels, buying upgrades, clearing more levels, and then hitting the prestige button again. The first couple of times it's fine, there's still satisfaction to be had from getting platinum on all levels, but after that it's really just a timesink, all for a single achievement. The devs are aware that people don't like it, and have even agreed in threads on this topic that perhaps it's a little excessive, but they still haven't patched it to make it less tedious. So I'd say, if you don't care about 100% achievements on games, get this, it's a fun way to pass time while watching TV or Youtube, but if you're a completionist, maybe stay away. It's fun, but not THAT fun.Edit, 9/28/17: Just 100%'d the game, and I've never been happier to uninstall something. To do that, I had to download someone else's save file that was up to 19 prestiges, and get to the 20th one myself. I still can't recommend the game unless you don't care about achievements; it's so incredibly tedious trying to get that last one that all possibility of fun is sucked out of the game. If you only had to prestige, say, five times, and it got a little more difficult or ANYTHING changed with each prestige, that would be a lot better, without feeling impossible or tedious."

No time limits. 3 bullets, One Crosshair. Crowd of zombies. Do as much damage as possible. Menus can be fully used with xboxpad through shoulder buttons.Some real PC resolutions,  Solid art direction, nice sprites, animations and overall tone. Precision shooter with limited ammo where you study crowd patterns to create chain reactions. Unlockable upgrades allow to increase reactions from zombies on death making chains easier to execute. Audio was good overall."
