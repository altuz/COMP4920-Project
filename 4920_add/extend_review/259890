Despite this, it is nicely detailed with some good quality machinery models and some accurate history behind them. The game can get boring at points but overall is quite satisfying to play. For those of you who are familiar with Farming Simulator, this game has more manual labour involved in farming but is less of a game. A nice alternative to relax a bit and farm!"

Realistic, if i saw someone merge to tractors together, i would call this realistic."

Worthless and a rip-off.  The fact that Steam has a no-refund policy in these cases is theft and I'm reporting this to my Attorney General's office.
