I requested ""tech support"" thru Steam and they granted me an audience 2 weeks later with the standard remove the game then re-download, etc. etc and obviously didn't read my ticket that I carefully typed out to them explaining exactly what it was doing and what the problem was. This game is buggy as hell (before Steam got a hold of it), and they had to have known it was going to be a problem based on the reviews of this game online. Add that to completely incompetant and nonexistant tech support via Steam and you have a waste of money on your hands. There is a group out here on Steam warning people about Steam's refusal to stand behind the games they sell, nor give refunds, nor give store credit, etc. We need to join together with groups like this to demand Steam take better care of its customers and starting appreciating our $ and act like a real store."

My primary complain is that there is no competition; no other farms are trying to service the cities so the only game over is if you spend yourself into a corner. Trying to create a grain farm is thankless and unrewarding, which might be realistic, but it pretty much mandates that you enter into beef cattle or dairy (dairy has a huge ROI). The graphics are pleasant, but the SFX for clicking buildings is obnoxious and the music is wildly out of place for this bucolic setting. Still, if you're a huge sim fan like myself, you can find some fun here."

The game is very buggy after you have established a large farm (multiple medium industries). There are no updates or support for the game. Good concept but horrrible and I do mean horrible execution.Pros:- Good Concept.Cons:- Game crashes randomly.- Trucks get stuck at road intersections.- Buildings can get stuck in the ""currently building"" mod and never get completed (but somehow function).- Several errors within the engine that either won’t allow you to set up a service and create a loop that occupies the vehicle until and condition is meet (i.e. truck stuck trying to deliver to town or industry where the contract or reserves are full).- Start location for vehicles can randomly be identified as a town (i.e. vehicles will start from a town and halt all other vehicles spawning from the depot until the vehicle returns to the depot via fields or non-road paths).In, conclusion do not buy this game.

I think that a mixed review would be fair.It's not a farming simulation like farming simulator, it's more like a farming management.  You need to buy building, machinery, land and field.  Hire and assign staff.  Sell harvest, product, find contract, etc.  There is no proper tutorial, but that's ok, you need to find out by yourself how the game work.  That is something I enjoyed because it was not easy.For sure that game have some crashing issues, but not that much.  Save often and it's ok, it won't ruin the game.  Maybe I was lucky.  There is two thing you need to know tough (because - it look like / it's -  a bug).1 . Paved road is not considered as a road to connect your building, So don't connect to it exept one farm road to let your truck reach towns.2. When you harvest, if you have an error message ""building not connected to road"".  Maybe it is because you didn't assign your harvester to a place where it can unload the grain.In summary, if you saved often and take time to learn the game, you have a good 10$ farming management game."

I was lucky and only encountered a couple (running on Windows 7) but others have reported several others, including being unable to run the game at all.If you can play the game, as I was able to, you will love it. It's a great farming management experience."

,Not Recommended,259910,32038192,Posted: 29 May,all,Murmudamus,"First off. I was lucky enough not to encounter any game-breaking bugs, not even 1 crash.This game had so much potential but it looks like it was developed half-way and then released. It doesnt have any of the finishing touches that a complete game would have, like an encyclopedia on the elements in the game. There is enough moving mechanics in this game that it would need that.Pro's:Decent management of farming, automated instructions, etc.3D environmentMany plants/animals/machineryCon's:Incomplete automation (You can tell a truck to take something from A to B but cannot give conditions. Anno1604 had this very simple feature, which is a much older game)Skill/Leveling system unlocks equipment/animals/plants (This skill system itself isnt bad but it limits your gameplay significantly due to implementation. You have to basically grind through the levels before you can play a sandbox game)No sandbox game!!!!!! (What? Really? A simulator game without a sandbox?!?!?! MADNESS!!!!!!)No encyclopedia to look up how things should be used and their effects. (This is just pure documentation people... c'mon!)Roads... oh my.. the roads. (Once you play this game for a while you will hate all roads. The way the road construction work gives me nightmares. I dont know how much time I wasted trying to build a road where I wanted it)Single instance playing. (Yup. Once you start a game you wipe out a previous game. You know... just because)Conclusion:This is a gem that never got cut. It is best not to love this game and have a broken heart. It could have been such a great game :("
