,Recommended,259980,7626486,"Posted: 10 November, 2013",all,Charkie,"The biggest departure of the series within the collection of You Don't Know Jack games on Steam. You Don't Know Jack 4: The Ride is locked in at 13 questions per game, with themed episodes that you choose based on your answer to a hypothetical question before each game. You don't pick your questions, either. Instead, you pick how much each question will be worth, although it's mostly random. It's a much darker and grittier game (literally), with times where it will actively try to mess with you (like disabling all vowels on your keyboard when entering your name), and with a light plot that has multiple endings to chose from. This is definitely the most bizarre game in the YDKJ series, but I think it might actually be my favorite."
,Recommended,259980,10824339,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,怖い夢,"By far one of the best Jack games to date. Yeah, some of the questions are a bit dated (hey, it was made in 1998), but it still fun to play. The classic questions types are back like ""Dis or Dat"" and (to the hosts' dismay) ""Ticklish Testgum"" (Gibberish Questions) along with new ones like ""Roadkill"" and ""Jack BINGO"". ""Roadkill"" is simular to the Jack Attack, but you have to connect two items together instead of finding an item's match. ""BINGO"" has you buzz in when the correct letter of the answer is lit up, simular to Three Way from YDKJ 3. It does add a lot of variety to the game. This game features all the host from previous Jack games and has a small story arc (you'll know what it is by the second time you play). Don't worry, it's still the same game with the randomness and twisted trivia you know and love. Also, screws has been changed and for the better in my opinion. Instead of pressing S once to screw somebody, you have to hit S multiple times to make the question totally unreadable and force your opponents to answer the question, whether it's readable or not. One small thing I want to point out is the music. The electric guitar can really get you pumped to play. Special mentions goes to both versions of the Jack Attack music, by far the most tense music out of all Jack games. The one downside is that this game is very US-centric. So if you do not live in the United States, the jokes and refrences can fly right over your head. This poses a problem since most of the jokes are built into the questions. All in all, if your looking for a fun party game to play with your friends (or alone for all you hermets out there) then this game is a must buy."

If you've never played any of the You Don't Know Jack (YDKJ) games, then all you need to know is that it's a fun trivia-based game with a twist. The questions are challenging and amusing as well as the question types featured in this game (e.g. Dis or Dat, Road Kill, Gibberish Questions). I highly recommend buying this game!"

,Recommended,259980,29390860,Posted: 20 January,all,Jean de L'Ours,"Compared to the last three main volumes, You Don't Know Jack Volume 4: The Ride marks a noticeable shift in gameplay, art style, and themes.  Upon starting, a question is posed to the player(s) based around some topic (ranging anywhere from the circus to death).  The only answers available are ""yes"" or ""no""; the chosen answer will set the tone for the game.  From there on, the player is taken on an elevator ride of sorts, being asked the typical questions by a disembodied female narrator.  A new question asks if the player has gone on ""The Ride"" before; if so, there may be some quirk involved in the naming section (for example, on one of my return games, I was locked into only using vowels to enter my name).  This deliberate change makes for some amusing scenarios.  Gameplay is also different, where players can select the amount of money a question is worth.  A new mini-game called RoadKill has the player(s) finding the shared quality between two ideas/people/etc (e.g., the solution for ""Mini ___"" and ""Bradley ___"" would be Cooper).  After every answer is given, the player(s) are asked what do all the previous answers have in common, proving to be a great test of memory as well as reasoning.  Finally, it ends with the usual round of Jack Attack.  The only difference here from previous games is that the amount a player receives or loses for answers is selected like the questions.  Clearly the grungier entry to the YDKJ series, The Ride is certainly worth a look into for bawdy humorists, trivia titans, and those nostalgic about the 1990s."

I live in Russia and English is my second language, however, I can totally enjoy that game at almost fullest still when I get friends to play it with me (given their English knowledge is just as good) This game is not so emphatic on celebrities unlike the more relevant ones so it makes this perfect for me. Mostly, the trivia in this is all about general knowledge and something that is already history and not a thing anymore e.g Clinton being presedent. (Can see the recuring theme of developers that can't get over the Cold War)Game here is devided into episodes under one topic. Topics can vary from Parenting to Fetishes. Also, a great point is that there are mini-games that can no longer be found in the modern editions, such as ""Bingo"" or ""Road kill""It's my favorite game in the series. You can pick this one and not worry about the others.See you at the bottom"

On the other hand, the game is also the noisiest JACK, both aurally and visually, and all the games are a forced 13 questions.  In the end, I've got to give this JACk a thumb down.  This one's only for the completionist YDKJ fans."

But I like even more when there's lots of twists, nooks and crannies to spice up the gameplay. And this game is no exception. The 4th installment of the You Don't Know Jack trivia game series brings us more than we have seen in any of the games so far. You get to experience new things like Screws that can fly onto the screen and block the question and answers. Another new feature is the game categories, the new ones specifically. Each of which do a spectacular job of heightening up the facts as well as making your brain go numb about what the next answer could be.  Take Roadkill for example, a game with 7 answers followed by a final bonus which tips the scales in any way. Get the first few answers right and you're good to go. Get the final bonus wrong however and you can kiss your cash goodbye!I also like the fact that you can get different amounts of cash when you buzz in to pick an amount. From the stingy $120 up to $12,000 in one question. However depending on the difficulty of the question the maximum value goes up and down. And that helps when thinking whether to relax or not.Another great feature is that all your favourite characters are there; Cookie, Guy, Schmitty, Buzz and Nate, all of whom get to play a decent role in the game.YDKJ 4 (The Ride) has some great things to offer. I can't really fit it all in, so I suggest you play it to find out more."
