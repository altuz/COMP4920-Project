,Recommended,260000,15694634,"Posted: 4 May, 2015",all,Phaota,"I've loved this game and the original one since it came out back in 1997, so it is awesome that Steam has it available.  I could play my original disc version, but Win 7 doesn't like Windows 3.1/95 games.  This have never been an easy game series to master.  The questions are often time quite difficult, and crazy (but that's the fun of it all).  It would have been nice it the host, Cookie, had continued through into the rest of the games, but he stepped down for another actor after this outting.  Everything about the first three Jack games are great.  The humor, the setting, the difficulty (which can♥♥♥♥♥♥you off at times since you come away saying to yourself, ""Crap!  I knew that!  Why didn't I choose that answer!?""  Even the credits are hilarious with the fake commercials.  If you love quirky, fun and challenging trivia games, don't miss this or Volumes 1 (the Xtra Larged Edition) and 2, the Volume 4 - The Ride.  Skip Volume 3.  It got bad reviews back when it was first released."

I bought the bundle pretty much the instant I saw that, at long last, the YDKJ games were available on Steam (well, some of them).YDKJ Movies was tough when I played it when it first came out, because I was pretty young and hadn't seen that many movies. Now it's still really tough, because the majority of movies I've seen came out since 1997 (or at least are fresher in my memory). I'm pretty good at trivia, so I never found any of the other YDKJ games difficult, but this one's still rough. Still, the humor and nostalgia more than make up for it, and getting questions wrong just means more opportunities for Cookie to hilariously insult me. I don't even mind."

As in, really know them. You can't just be all ""oh, I like movies"" and expect to get by in this game. You have to activate your brain and fork out hard facts about really tough Hollywood jive.Get this game if you want to both be intellectually stimulated and humiliated."
76561197970721201,Recommended,260000,8225850,"Posted: 23 December, 2013",all,MahakGTR34,"This game is really for hardcore movie buffs. I've watched probably close to 3000 movies in 3 decades but this particular YDKJ game is still quite hard. I wouldn't recommend it to a casual player, more for the super hardcore quiz / movie buffs.On a note to the game itself, I'm pretty disappointed. There is no option to play full screen, no choice of screen resolution or similar. Looks crappy, it's a old game and to be expected. The commentator is funny for the most part but sometimes I'd rather just play than to listen to him.Hate the fact that you always have to watch the intro which takes like a minute until you can actually play. There should be an option to skip the intro.Verdict: Good value game for hardcore quiz (movie) buffs. Terrible integration on steam as in no achievements, no nothing, no option for screen resolution etc. The ""Millionaire"" games may be better suited for the casual player."

I hate it.So, I liked the first few You Don't Know Jack games in my youth, and always felt that they posed interesting questions paired with good humor, even when I was younger.I also love movies and have watched several thousand, so this should be good for me, right?Uh, no. I've read some people's complaints on here about the interface, and they are plain wrong. It's fine, aside from not adjusting to resolutions above 1024x768, doesn't really matter.The real problem is the obscurity of the questions.As an example, I played a random 21 questions game, and in order to finish the game with a score above ZERO, the winning player would have to be intimately familiar with:Our Man FlintReality BitesSong of the SouthShe Wore a Yellow RibbonMyra Breckenridgeall of the seven dwarf's namesmost titles of Jerry Lewis' filmographyand NO ONE I was playing with got a score over ZERO. So, yeah, fun game, maybe, if you're Leonard Maltin, and you're playing with Gene Shalit and Ken Jennings. But even for the average movie buff, let alone the average person, this is just silly."

The game was obviously made quite a while ago without HD resolutions in mind and it's definitely not a game for kids with all the adult humor which was definitely a good thing in my situation. This has made a great addition to my party game line-up."

,Recommended,260000,28878942,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Jean de L'Ours,"Similar to You Don't Know Jack Sports, this iteration of the franchise deals exclusively with Film trivia.  Most of what I said in my YDKJ Sports review can be applied here, just change ""sports"" to ""movies.""  Movie buffs will get the most out of this; comedy will be the saving grace for everyone else.  Again, I think it would be prudent to purchase this in the bundle, and that's where my recommendation falls."

76561198149993698,Recommended,260000,35460245,Posted: 3 October,all,braithy,"[System used - Win 10; 1070GTX, Gaming rig and Win10 HP 8mb ram laptop with 2GB dedicated graphics]I have always liked the ""You don't know Jack"" games - having played them since their first incarnation many window platforms ago.  They can lose their magic a little because they follow the same formula, but it's bit like having different trivial pursuit games, enough different topics and a bit of fun to play with someone else, or by yourself.As I am from Australia the only downside is that there is a lot of content that is not relevant or is specific to US (eg: some comedy and tv shows that may not be shown here), although if you have a good general kinowledge of movies then this is only a very minor criticism.  I would like to see some Oz movies included of course.  Note that I have played this game a lot more than the 2 hours it says on my steam account.Recommended for those who have a good knowledge of movies, enjoy other ""Jack"" games and get on sale.My rating is 6/10 overall for gameplay.(note I use ratings where anything above 5 is ok to excellent)"
