,Not Recommended,260080,33401365,Posted: 9 July,all,WarlockUK,"Not as good as the original; the intro video is unskippable, it's still locked to 800x600, the catchy Jingles that made the original so fun have gone... it's just some boring animation and questions."
,Recommended,260080,28879978,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Jean de L'Ours,"The most recent member of the Classic Pack, You Don't Know Jack Volume 6 The Lost Gold offers a dazzling arstyle and fresh graphics.  In a bizarre turn of events, a plot is attached to the game.  A pirate, through the shenanigans of treasure-seeking, is trapped by a curse.  The only way to free him is, you guessed it, winning money through the game.  After a certain amouns is collected, he'll be freed from his supernatural bonds.  In fact, every now and then the pirate will attempt to help secure his freedom by sneaking a priate-themed question into the game.  These questions are in the vein of the Impossible Questions of Volume 3, but centered around pirate knowledge (for example, one question asks for the name of Blackbeard's parrot).  Beyond that, everything else is standard fare.  Like The Ride and Headrush, there's no option to select how many questions the game will have and the comedy is stellar as always.  The Lost Gold is certainly worth all of your doubloons and is great to share with friends over a bottle of rum."
,Not Recommended,260080,25682248,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,Xen Killer,The game felt cheap and older than previous versions of YDKJ. I recommend trying out YDKJ 4: The Ride if you haven't already. It's easily a better version.
,Not Recommended,260080,30925025,Posted: 3 April,all,Salarn,https://youtu.be/yHXe1vKMp3cOne of the sauciest pirate themed YDKJ episode yet.  Up to four players challenge themselves to tricky trivia where figuring out the question is often harder than the question.The basic formula holds strong in this iteration but is still limited by the low screen resolution and very dated question pool.  The better choice is to get the more modern games/
,Not Recommended,260080,25409988,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,Weeks,"Unfortunately, The Lost Gold took one step forward and 2 steps back. While it has some pretty cool new features, it also lacks things that made previous titles so enjoyable, especially as a party game. Probably a title to pull out if you're alone or you and your friends have played the other titles to death."

I play a lot of traditional board games with my friends and I thought these games would be fun and let us make fun of each other. Unfortunately, and I'm really not sure why, maybe I'm just 10 years too late to the party, but no one ever wants to play them. I bet you'll find the same. So, sure buy it if you like playing by yourself."
