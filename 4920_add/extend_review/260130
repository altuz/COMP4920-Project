76561198149161357,Recommended,260130,12529793,"Posted: 17 October, 2014",all,TheInkFox88,"As with the Origional, Zero is a true work of art. The Generation system is vastly improved from the original, and the affection system adds its own level of stratagy. The gameplay, while at first glance appears simple, is, in a word, ""Multi-Layered"". Mastering Esoterica and Combination arts is key to not only surviving some of the most difficult battles, but also recieving some of the best items in the game. With that in mind, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Agarest Wiki that contains truely invaluable information on the game itself.While i love the game, I have to mention two dissapointments I have in concern to the actual game itself. First, the monster capture and combination system can be a boon to any player. If only for the Title System and the High End items you can get by using it. However, capturing monsters can be a chore sometimes, and often feels like a waste of time due to the grind required to max it out.Second, the blacksmithing system has one infuriating element that i wish they had eliminated from the origional. That is the Random Item system that occures while smithing. On occasion, while crafting items, instead of the desired item you recieve a random craftable item instead. This still uses the materials, and after 3000 craft attempts, I only recived one item I cared about, or was useful. Instead you generally recive items that are either utterly useless, or are low level and already abundant.As to the Steam download, it has one major glitch i was unable to remedy. Unfortunatly, there is a glich where on many characters in both conversation scenes and in the gallery, the characters images are obsucered by all the other alternate appearances being layered over eachother at the same time. This takes away from the character and story driven expreance that is essential to any JRPG.On a possitive note, the Steam DLC is absolutly fantastic. Without it, many cassual gamers may find the baseline grind to level up and aquire both Gold and EP to be a daunting task. After purchasing the DLC it was almost like starting a new game + without ever having to have played the game.I would recomend this series to anyone who enjoys JRPG's or RPG's in general. For a more epic experience I suggest playing the original and then loading over the completed game data to Zero.All in all, I'd give this game a solid 9 out of 10.As a simple footnote I would suggest that due to suggestive sexual content in this game, parental supervison is advised."

The characters themselves are pretty cool. The storyline and setting are great.It's really repetitive. It's really repetitive. I'ts reeeeaaaallllyyyy repetitive. Every battle is basically the same throughout the whole game, just with different monsters. I know, a lot of games are like that. But you really start to feel it with this game. It's really repetitive. After a certain point in the second generation, the game has a huge upspike in difficulty, meaning each battle takes longer to do. I hate how it can take some of the greatest warriors in the continent, working together, a 20+ hit combo to kill a single slime. I'm 50 hours in, and I haven't even been grinding or anything and I've become bored. Maybe I'll finish it, maybe I won't. It's really repetitive.If you want to play this game to experience the story and stuff, I actually REALLY suggest playing it on easy. Maybe the battles will go quicker and it won't feel really repetitive and you won't become as disheartened as I have.It's really repetitive - 6.5/10"
76561198012940714,Recommended,260130,12170661,"Posted: 20 September, 2014",all,Options,"5/10Agarest Zero is the prequel to Agarest: Generations of War. People who played the old Agarest will find that a few things have changed.Starting with the good improvements. A fast-forward option during dialogue, fully turn-based dungeons with no more analog crawling or suprise encounters, and a slightly more informative esoteric book. A simplified version of the original Agarest is build into the game, and can be unlocked if you play NG+ on hard. As long as you get True End in the Zero universe, you will unlock True End in the Agarest vanilla universe automatically. You can unlock various vanilla characters and combine them into your zero party for maximum choice.There are bad points too. For one, there are only two generations instead of five, although unlike Leonheardt who was stuck with a sword, you will have some control over Sieghart's weapon. The True End mechanic is also different, it being dependent on relationship scores and less than a handful of crucial storyline choices. You will not unlock the true ending unless you are familiar with dating sims; it is possible to get all nine women in the group to love you maximally, but unless you get somewhere close to that you won't get the true ending. The game is faster-paced due to less generations, but not fast-paced enough to warrent repeated crapshoots on the dating sim mechanic only to find out that you fail true end again and again. If you follow the True End guide for Zero on Agarest Wiki to a tee, it is a linear process and you can unlock it. But then Sieghart/Leonis will not feel like they have any consistent preference or personality. It will just be hardcore pragmatic metagaming.On an important tangent, this game may be a little bit less friendly to female gamers than the vanilla game, because of the much more increased emphasis on the dating sim aspect. Women-to-women conversations in this game are also more superficial than vanillla. Female gamers can consider themselves warned.It is a game with pros and cons, but if you liked the original Agarest then you might as well get Zero because it comes with a simplified version of the original game plus the interface improvements."
,Recommended,260130,9844599,"Posted: 17 April, 2014",all,Bashfluff,"Keep in mind this is a quick review to help people decide if the game is worth a look at this price. I've played about thirty minutes or so thus far, but I will keep updating this review as I come across more parts of the game.Agarest is a fantasy tactical role playing game, much like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. Straight out of the heart of Japan with its flashy style and exaggerated character designs, this game drew me in right away with its setting and characters. It leads to a slow start; the game making sure that it introduces the characters and teaches you about the combat for thirty minutes minutes before FINALLY getting into the good stuff in regards to the story and character creation wasn't a good call, but it lays the groundwork for the story ahead.The real problem isn't the length of the opening in and of itself, though. It's the tutorial segments. The tutorial is drawn out and doesn't teach you anything you wouldn't know from playing any tactical role playing game. The characters and writing are on full display as you're taught the mechanics, making sure that you're at least slightly entertained, and they give you what you should well expect: flashy and fun attacks with all of the functionality you should expect from a game like this. But it's only exactly what you'd expect, and if you're going to demand total attention from the player like this, you need to be introducing things that players wouldn't know off the bat, and it just doesn't have any features like that in that first segment.Eventually, it does get into some new features, but at the time of writing, after going at this game for nearly an hour, I'd only just finished the tutorial and I'd only learned two things from the game that I wouldn't have known otherwise from playing other ones. Just two. When this game says 60-80 hours, it means it, but if this is the way that they're going to stretch out the playtime, I'm a bit wary. Still, they were able to cram a good bit of story in that time, too, and I actually rather enjoy it so far!This is a story-driven game, and make no mistake, it shows clear signs of the style it was drawn in.  From only being voice acted in Japanese, to the tropes that are made evident from the first moments of the game, it is made clear from the get go that this is a game that's going to follow the trends of anime in regards to its story and characters. If you aren't fond of that, you may be better off looking elsewhere for your fantasy tactical role-playing game fix.  But I am, and trust me, you have never seen a game that makes you think that you're watching an episode of anime more when you get past that tutorial and start the first boss fight. It's surreal to watch.From what I can tell, you're going to be in for an anime style game with stylish combat and a kickass story. If the story doesn't grab you, you're going to be waiting a long time for gameplay to kick in, because you have to go through a LOT of dialogue, but the gameplay itself is solid , and I can already tell the combo system is going to lead to plenty of fun down the road.First impressions? Grab it."

The games okay, I rather like the graphics for the most part, and the plot and characters make me want to keep playing.  That said the combat is what is making me uninstall it.  Just not my thing, and I love these type games.I'll be honest and say that some of this is probably due to my only 4 hours of play time.  But for starters, ingame it is rather poorly explained what the differences between the skills are (why use blast instead of rush, what are my miss chances, is regular damage the same as break damage or is that only for filling the break meter, that sort of thing).  The details screen you can pull up really explains very little.  I could live with this really.  What lost me though the linking system.  I just really don't like this mechanic, makes fights feel far longer and less tactical than they should.  Felt like I spent all my time looking for glowing squares for linking people and trying to maximize the number of combos in the action screen I could pull off than trying to outsmart/outposition the enemy and make use of terrain.  Doesn't help that the view needs tilted up a few more degrees, it's rather hard to make stuff out sometimes even with changing the direction.I really want to like this game, but it's just not happening."
76561198099222256,Recommended,260130,12363728,"Posted: 4 October, 2014",all,Bot Silver 1,"Short summary: This is an amazing turn based strategy game with unique weapons, and a huge variety of characters and unlockable skills. This game is similair to fire emblem combat system, and has a cliche but an entertaining story. There are several events, and incorporates the oh so common dating sims the japanese love as well. One of the best part of the game is without a doubt, the creation of your character, where it is a tarot card system, which randomizes your character in the vague direction you build him to be.Synopsis: Record of Agarest War Zero is the prequel to Record of Agarest War. The tale follows Sieghart, an army commander who gains magical powers from a strange woman named Mimel. Blossoming from this setup, Record of Agarest War Zero is a slow-paced tale treading on familiar territory: the world is in danger and it's up to a small band of warriors to set things right.Combat: Record of Agarest War Zero's shining light is combat. Moving characters into position like a chess board is a challenging undertaking, but a rewarding one. Depending on which square characters occupy, they can link to other characters to unleash joint attacks with powerful results. But it's the calculated movement of sprites into position that makes exciting battles. While the terrain is flat and backgrounds repetitive, the environment is still a non-factor like the original Agarest War. The strategic requirements of success are fulfilling for all strategy fans. (Battles dish out experience like candy, yet money feels constantly tight.)Gameplay:  The Agarest War series is different from other strategy games is that the story is split over multiple generations. When the curtain finally closes on Sieghart's side of the story, it's his offspring with the maiden-of-highest-regard that carries on the tale into future years. You are also forced to progress along a fixed path, forced to stop at each dot along the way for a battle. These often have no bearing on the plot and are simply there to make the journey from one chapter to the next take as long as possible.(although if the battle does indeed get too tedious, pressing q will turn on auto battle. A word of advice is use it on enemies you will dominate, due to the fact that the auto A.I is not the best.)Overall, i love this game, while it may say i only have 10 hours or so, i have the rest of the series on my ps3, with a total over 200 hours, a great game focusing on turn based strategy, and dating sim like playthrough."

It is shorter, the UI easier to manage, and crafting elements are more straight-forward.  My main complaint is the series still doesn't know what it wants to be.  The developer packed so many side-elements into the game that they become chores to manage.  They must have been working with a checklist; capturing monsters-check, grinding-got it, unlocking crafting levels-yup.

A lot of the wandering around has been cut out and the game is basically streamlined from one combat point to the other that takes you to all your quest objectives as well. The real meat of the game is inside the combat where you are encouraged to use more force then needed to achieve ""overkills"" in which additional items are dropped. The story seems very typical of what I know of the genre. Gods and Demons, end of the world, everyone fighting everything...over and over again....forever. But I am having fun fighting these things. On a side note I find myself smiling a lot of the mixture of 2d sprites laid ontop on hi res enviroments, even the larger ""boss"" monsters have been rendered in hd. Its pretty neat and for 6$ on the steam summer its worth every penny."

If you'd like to chain a lot, you'll need to learn how to use this properly! I find it interesting because of the different layout of Extended Areas for each player and that where they are facing affects it. For those who love to challenge themselves and see how far they can go... this is for you!- Different areas that you can choose where to fight? Not bad!- The animated sprite (Motion Portrait) makes it a tad bit life-like as they talk.- Anime-style handsome guys and pretty girls =P- Free DLCs! Yay!Cons:- The tutorial is soooo long TT Well it is good for those who are not used to tactical games... but for me who have played quite a few (e.g. FFTactics, Tactic Ogres, FE), it is one chunk of boring part right at the start. Be patient!- DLCs right from the start! You become too OPed right from battle number 1 that the last thing to do is saying good-bye to that fun ~ So I would suggest turning off the DLCs or just don't use it!Who is this game for?- Those who love Love SImulation games, Tactic battles, Combo chainers, Anime-lovers, or those who, like me, loves Idea Factory!"

Specifically that it promoted grinding while discouraging grinding through it's system of ""Turns"" (# of battles) - too many turns prevented certain events or hindered later progress - which created an absurdly unfair game without any DLCs. However, in Agarest Zero the Turn system was completely removed. In addition, there are not as many random battles from Event to Event, unlike the first Agarest, making Zero a bit more shorter (which is usually bad, but better in this case) - to top it off Zero only has two generations instead of five. Albeit all of this, in the end, Zero feels just like a really long DLC than a new game. Much monsters from the first Agarest, exact sprites and sound, have been recycled throughout the game. Also, the majority of bosses are rendered in 3D and misreably fails to blend in with the 2D sprites. Furthermore, the UI is identical to the first game - a convulted mess of getting around. I'm all in for a green Earth, but this is just too much recycling. If it didn't work before why repeat the same mistake? Agarest Zero, above all, is just Agarest v1.5 with better packaging. Not necessarily a bad game but neither is it a good game. 5/10"

Theres also a digest mode where you play the original Agarest (which means, you get to play with 2 characters from the original and you'll be playing through 100% of the story).  Features remain the same, same Attacks, Spells & Items.  Totally different story, Its kinda pointless playing digest mode unless there was something missing from the original.  What makes digest mode hard is that it has you only fighting major battles, not the minor battles.

76561198027986224,Recommended,260130,9947436,"Posted: 26 April, 2014",all,Hi-C,"After several hours int the game, I think I have a basic understanding of the game.Gameplay - Very basic and combo driven.  I like my JRPG's to have combo systems, it adds a little bit of flavor to the game.  The tiled fields are not by any means extremely large, so positioning is rather important when trying to corner enemies or create an eleborate combo that will excessively damage the enemy.  I would like to say that the gameplay very much reminds me of Disgaea.  For those familiar with Disgaea, you may recall positioning characters in certain directions to obtain minimal damage and best damage output, same features here.  The actual playing field is not as elaborate by any means though (no elevation).  You do gain ""field"" options though which can influence the party and the enemies on the field.Difficulty wise, this game does encourage leveling and item grinding.  Without properly leveling characters, you will meet a swift defeat.  The amount of damage the monsters give and take is comparable to your own MC.  It's quite a bit.  Grinding monsters also generates technical points and money, which can be used to buy weapons, new smithing techniques, alchemy items, and the like.An actual downside to the combat system is the camera system.  It is extremely rigid, offering only about 4 angles of the field.  While you eventually learn that you can click whichever tile you desire despite the UI and direction of the camera, I find it bothersome that the camera system is not more flexible.  The combat system does not also offer many options aside from using skills, standby (thus generating action points for skills), no defense option, items, and reminding yourself which combo-able skills are available.  Depending on how 'intricate' you enjoy combat games, this could be somewhat off-putting.Lastly, the DLC which I tested on my characters absolutely break the game.  I can absolutely disregard how much damage I am taking or giving, because it simply does not matter.  It's a bit of a snooze fest when it comes to beating up monsters, even bosses.  Even so, it is important to level the characters so that they may obtain new traits and skills.  An overly equipped lvl5 offensive mage will still fall prey to a group of lvl6-7 monsters if not careful. Of course, I've managed to negate that.  I can simply focus on grinding levels, items, and the story at this point.Story and Characters:  Not incredibly difficult to follow.  Nothing really wow'd me in regards to plot.  Your a relatively distinguished soldier, who dies, is revived by a mage, and proceeds to take a journey to save the world.  As you proceed through the world, you do come across a variety of members who join the party.  Most of them female.  The female characters have an affection system which is affected at various ""events"" and your decision during them.  Furthermore, the Oracle can ""predict"" your offspring and their stats based on your current relationship and stats.  The male characters don't impress me anymore than the females, but the chemistry between the cast as a whole flows rather well.  As of my progress in the game, there is no character development.I would say the most interesting aspect of the MC's stats are reflective of the choices you make at the very beginning of the game.  You choose particular class which is followed by several ""sub"" stat categories.  These influence a particular stat that will be easier or harder to increase as you level up the MC.All in all, the game is decent and worth killing time over if you're willing to sit down and take a journey.  The flaws are there, but nothing to fret over.  I'd give it a 7/10."

There is a small problem with the UI, in which random tiles will appear on screen, and block half the game, but simply reloading your save will fix the issue. The DLC from the pre-purchase makes it almost too easy, so try disabling all of them if you want a challenge.

It's not quite the game that the first Agarest was, so I'd recommend that one first, and after that, if you truly want more, you'll likely enjoy what Zero has to offer."

Each battle is set on a board delimited with squares (which is usually the norm) and each character has ""combo tiles"" linked with them. That means that if another character is staying in one of those, you can chain both characters and possibly chain skills which become even better skills. Sounds cool actually right? Well in theory yes... but since all characters have different combo tiles, you are pretty much forced to move the team in a certain way to combo, even if the positioning makes no sense. The combo system being the heart of the game, you can't really win without and essentially all battles will turn into a move A to that space, move B there so they can combo, so C has to be there and D there etc...

It is a world ridden with war between the Evil and the Light gods. You start the game in the middle of this war as Commander Zeeg~ (Sieghart.) Who soon finds himself at the feet of an evil Larva, a minor god. Events unfold and Zeeg~ is given the power to defeat this foe.  I am not going to spoil much, but it is almost exactly like what happened to Leonhart from the first game.Agarest is a SRPG, Stratagey Roleplaying Game. The battle system is turned based. So if you do not like turn based games well, I am sorry. This game may not be for you. This title also introduces several new features its predecessor didn't, like the Free Intention system and Extra mode. Extra mode is for people who have played the previous installment in the franchise, Agarest: Generations of War and the Free Intention system is another relationship builder. It will sometimes give items, new CGs, and costumes for your party to use. Also they added in the Action Animation System that allows the characters to move their lips during cutscenes. It is pretty neat for the time the game was actually released, 2009, but for todays standards it is pretty mediocre.If you were expecting to have 30+ characters like in this first game you will be disappointed. This game only contains two genertaions unlike the previous five, and there are only fiften members that you will be finding in your party. However I do not think this detracts from the game in any way whatsoever. The game is still 80+ hours, like its predecessor and the story is very immersive.Overall - I really enjoy playing the game. If you are a fan of Disgaea or Fire Emblem I thnk you will find this game different with the added relationship systems. 8/10."

So, if u are not ready to invest at least 300 hours into this game, you may stop right here.The reason why i discourage anyone to buy this game is simply because it really becomes tedious (excluding those fanatic JRPG fans) when you finish the story of a generation. Why? Because 1. the battle repeat themselves incessantly, 2. THERE IS NO STORY! I would just say that, even after finishing the entire prequel, i found only piece-by-piece information about why the hell was i fighting at all! Mostly it was only about doing everything your bosses or some random girl on the road told you to do, which might well involve hours of meaningless and random exploration of the world. It is nothing more than boring. And dont even mention the horrible battle music which repeats itself without a single twitch throughout my entire 30 hour gameplay.To put it short, simply mark my words if u would: a RPG without a good story is just crap, if not a piece of sh*t.

Yes.The storyline is bland and generic and offers nothing intriguing or exciting to the player. At this stage I barely know what my goal is (other than looking after Mimel and picking up more (female) characters to add to my party) and I've no desire to find out. The parts that talk about the storyline are tedious and bland at best and ultimately unfulfilling for the player. A solid RPG should have the player wanting to know what the next twist in the game is; Agarest fails to deliver on that aspect. Considering playing on feels like a chore that I want to avoid doing at all costs.The tutorial barely gives you the bare bones of combat which is simple enough to pick up despite being poorly mapped, and the character creation part is totally left uninformed. The player absolutely doesn't know what to do without the help of a guide and to be honest I have no idea what on earth I picked for the MC, Sieg. Combat gets boring and repetitive quickly. If you're a player who dislikes grinding there's no worry as you're forced to grind and play through fights just to get anywhere on the map.Speaking of characters, the characters of the game are bland, dull and boring with predictable, mundane personalities. There's a womaniser without a hint of charm, a little mysterious childish girl and then there's the MC who is the equivalent of bread without butter. The voice acting and somewhat pretty character designs aren't enough to carry the personalityless characters through with the bland script. Another part of the game which is a little more fun is the dating aspect where you woo the ladies you pick up for your party. However, Fire Emblem: Awakening offers the same kind of game as Agarest but with a better script, a easier to follow plot and interesting characters.For the most part, Agarest has a lacklustre script and a poor combat system which ultimately lets the full game down. A much more interesting story with more engaging characters is the minimum this game would need to carry it through with the current combat system. The pixel graphics are somewhat charming, at the very least.My overall opinion? I wish I could refund this game and would do so in a heart beat if I was able to."

After halfhour of mind numbing matches you will get few lines of dialogue about main story, which is really hard to get invested in with all the usual cliches of jrpgs and paper thin characters around it, while at the same time in some parts story also takes itself wayyyy tooo seriosly.Time to time jrpg fans will be rewarded from their effort with some kawaii desu desu stuff with their waifu candidates, but the ratio of content/boring fights feels unbearable, to me atleast. With more boss fights and less tedious grind, this game would've been good or atleast decent experience, but since it isnt, its hard to recommend this game to anyone without a word of warning about the significant boredom factor that this game has."

That however , fails to keep up the motivation long enough to endure its biggest downside. of the 78 hours i played , 90% of the time were spent in battle. Not ""ever changing"", challenging battles , that make you curious for more though. It is the same , boring strategy of the same long battle over and over trough the whole game, one hundred times fold. one fight may take 10-20 minutes , the number of fights between the bits of storry parts grow from just 3 to monstrous 15+ , and with monsters getting more hp and numbers, its only getting longer , but hardly more challenging or refreshing in any way. Further more , unless you paid for the DLC for a nice cut down of battle durations, you will likely end up forced to grind for materials - which are needed to craft the newer weapons and skills , because they can NOT be bought from the shop just like that. Unless you want to run around with your lvl 1 sword trough the whole game , you'll be forced to go repeat some dozen times of the battles you're sick and tired of anyways. Note also , that with those 78 hours i did not grind , because the addons came with a sale package.   At first , i was motivated to make no use of them , however... the frustration with the sheer amount of time spent doing boring, long and repetetive battles ended up changing my mind. Note also , that after nearly 80 hours , i have about 20 more hours of gameplay ahead. If this game is played without resorting to DLC weapons , you're in for 120-140 hours of torture. about 14 hours of those are enjoyable content with storry and challenging boss fights. All the rest feels like a horrible content stretching mess , meant to make people pay extra money for DLC packages with proper weapons.While i can't possibly know, wether you will not enjoy this extreemly unballanced ratio of mental torture and occasional fanservice,  i can say for sure that i did not. For a game heavily relying on time spent in tactical battle , it lacks tactical variety."

You basically move from dot to dot on a map with very little variation. Each dot either represents a fight, a village or event. Oh, and I guess there are some quest dots you enter into that just contain the above. There's a solid amount of customization, but it doesn't seem to serve much purpose. In almost 10 hours there hasn't been one fight that required any effort.Then there's the story itself. It feels like it could be interesting, if the characters weren't so cookie cutter and bland. You push through the drawn out fights to get to an event and you get terrible dialogue and hardly any real background on the story. Now I know 10 hours isn't enough to see the whole story, but it's more than enough to get the feel for the game.So if you like repetitive battles, boring characters and ZERO exploration, this is for you.

I've been finding it hard to continue to play since the characters and story either so bland or so over the top that it is difficult to care. I find myself dreading any 'events', but then also found myself starting to dread the combat since it was becoming so repetative.After reading other reviews it seems like at some point this game will take a sharp turn with the difficulty and tactics, but if you are looking for a great story and a great combat system right off the bat, I would maybe look elsewhere, or at least remember to stay away from using the DLC gained items until you need them."

The main character is as bland and boring as hat of any visual novel and the old style speaking with modern clothing doesn't blend together. The battle system is fine, but the relevance of various symbols is unexplained, so you have to figure out how the game works. Designing your character isn't explained well, all your choices are uninformed, you've no idea how it will affect you later.

,Not Recommended,260130,12981415,"Posted: 17 November, 2014",all,Fuzen,"To me, this game is awfully bad. The only point that I find quite interesting is the art, and it is the one that decided me to buy the game.So basically, Agarest Zero takes some element of the classic turn-based RPG and some other of the average heroic fantasy Visual Novel in order to offer its content ; in the same way as Kamidori Alchemy Meister for instance. (Alas, Agarest is well worse than this one…)At the moment, I didn't play much but for what I have played… not once have I had fun.So, firstly, the RPG aspect of the game :— The turn-based gameplay is interesting with it's mechanics but most of the strategic part of the game is left behind by the fact that the fights are heavily gear-reliant.— The battles are repetitive ; if the few first one can make you think about some strategies, you quickly make one or two that will work in most occasions. In the end, the lack of diversity and the massive amount of “long” battles transforms the battle in some sort of torture sessions.— The character creation is too confusing. Firstly, you have to choose between three classes (warrior, battle mage, sorcerer) which is quite understandable even if nothing tells you what these classes are really about. Next… you have to choose five cards that will determine the weapon you'll use and your stats growth. So… for the weapons, you have two icons on each card so you can more or less guess what weapon you will be given. Now for the stats… NOTHING actually tells you what these cards does. In other words, if running countless tries to get the char you want is your thing… this game is for you. Otherwise… well… Good luck.Secondly, the VN aspect :— The story is quite common for what I have seen. Basically, it's just a way to put the game in context but chances are you won't find it more than just average. It's not bad but we have seen way much elaborated stories in the RPG genre.— As I said earlier, the art is well drawn. Backgrounds are well detailed and the fact that characters are not fixed during dialogs makes the game in itsel a bit more living.— The one thing that I hated: the affection system. It… follows absolutely no logical rule. For example, I made some choice with a character, that got me +1 in affection with this one BUT on the other hand, I got -1 with another one that was not even here and that had nothing to do with this choice. It's as if it were totally random…I'll probably update this review later if I progress in the game but for now, if you are seeking a JRPG/VN game, I could only recommand you to search elsewhere."

Very generic bad rock music one moment, bloopy horns with a vaguely villainous vibe the next, then an annoying synth track for no reason. It's bad. Really bad. Sound effects are even worse, especially in menus. Everything has to have a way too loud, and way too long sound.-Gameplay is generic, watered down, and just bad. Tutorial is front loaded with extraneous info and terrible animation.-Dialogue is forced and weak. Extremely unfunny attempts at humor. The muppet mouths just makes the voice acting terrible. Considering the main draw of this game is to look at anime girls and try to date them, the fact that the art is crap and the dialogue is terrible results in a boring, soulless void which begs the question of: WHY.-Creating your character class is about as insanely vague as it could be. ""Choose 5 cards out of these 24 to define what weapons your character is good at.""

This is one game in the Generations series and is a prequel to the first game in the series. However you can jump into this game regardless if you have played any games in the series.The graphics are just beautiful and vibrant on PC, it has full controller support but I do not recommend using it. The game is simple enough that even a console convert like me prefered playing it with the M & K.The main reason is using the controller in the battle scenes is just plain awkward and frustrating to say the least. The game is very grinding natured so if you prefer to just run through in a linear way I would suggest Kingdoms of Amalur or something like that. This is a Japaneese RPG thru and through, so prepare to grind a lot.One real downside to the game is the sheer lack of varied arenas, they use only a handfull for all of the battles which is sad. So if your are thinking mid way in a battle man I seen this before, you have.That said it is still worth it to pick it up, though I would when in a sale or featured game. While it is a quality made game I still feel the $20 + price tag is to high given the ridiculous cost of the DLC. That high price of the DLC is a bad trademark of the entire series to be honest.All in all I give the game a solid 7.5/10 I have to make a few points off for the lack of variance in the battle arenas, thee awkward camera controll, and the high cost of the DLC and game."

Although people say it's more limited, I agree on the matter of story. However the replay value is what made it more fun to me. In my opinion this game met the mark it should have but believed it could have been longer. On the matter, the same as the PS3 version. Still good fun though,"

The only problem I have with it is that combat feels a bit too slow paced. Like it takes 10-20 minutes to get through two battles and reach the next destination, well, that's what it feels like to me, I didn't time it. Anywho I guess it's becuase I'm eager to get to the next part in the story and these fights in the way are keeping me from my story so it's a bit annoying"

I never finished this one cause there is no option to change difficulty level and OMG ITS HARD. The first game has 5 generations, this one only has 2 but ive spent so much more time on this one grinding. It's fine at the start but in the late game every battle turns into what feels like I'm fighting a final boss on nightmare mode....with a team of twigs.....inanimate, normal, decomposing twigs.I still enjoyed this game though, like the first one I recomend it to people who love anime and strategy.I chalenge YOU!

In all honesty the original Record of Agarest War was and still is FAR more superior and still remains the best story in the series to this very day imho, but i'll still give this a fair 6/10 though, wouldn't been an 8 were it not for the bride-choice being all but completely removed in the Digest version of Record of Agarest War (not to be confused with Zero's story), seriously... :/   Again...  sorry Zero but i'm just being completely honest here... ^^;   I can only recommend it to those who REALLY want to know the short prequel story before the main, MUCH better story in the original RoAW. :<    Also...  They say that getting the True Ending in Zero is much easier than in RoAW, I find this to be VERY untrue since, as a matter fact...  The True Ending in RoAW was FAAAAAAAAAARR more easier to obtain than in Zero and I quote from Zero's True Ending guide:  ""However, unlike in Record of Agarest War, the requirements to get the True End are much less strict and much easier to obtain."" I HIGHLY disagree since I don't see one reason why this is true since, it was far more easier (and much more better imho, really :> ) to get the True Ending path in RoAW than it did in Zero, seriously...  Instead I replace the above quote like this: ""However, unlike in Record of Agarest War, the requirements to get the True End are much more strict and much harder to obtain."" And that, to me, is a LOT more true.  Also, I prefer the original design of the original monsters in the original RoAW such as the Dragon, Golem and so forth, just looks better imho. ^^;   All-in-all, I again only recommend Zero to those who REALLY want to know the prequel story before the main, better story of RoAW but if not then just please... PLEASE stick to RoAW 1 and 2, you'll get less of a headache that way... XD lol"

This review will be somewhat short as it vastly resembles what I wrote about the first one.Pros:1. Offered a prelude to the background story of the first installment which enlightened me on certain concepts that were used in the first but was not thoroughly explained.2. Characters were well done and likeable; could definitely see where they resembles characters in the first.3. Improvement on the battle system most welcomed. However, once again, this company comes back with the inane...alright will explain in the con.4, Monsters and graphics was improved for battle areas.5. Pro for me, but may not be for others is...long gameplay required to complete which is engaging and can be absolutely comical.Cons:1. Some things are lost in translation. I dont...know what...the hell the card thing in the beginning affected really. It was poorly explained.2. Yes, I played at the hardest difficulty; BUT BUUUT, there is this absolutely ridiculous jump in difficulty at times in these games and it is unexplainable even when I am vastly overleveled. Boom you just 'dead' in like one hit. Really fam, come again.3. This goddamn true ending business...listen...I dont know what to do to get the true ending. There is no hint or suggestion even after I completed the game, how to get it and also, I am kinda finguring out what it may be but seriously now, there must be a way to understand how to proceed.4. Lastly, it was definitely shorter and doesnt mean it fell far from the face...but I always wonder why the endings of all these games seem rushed or not fulfilling...Maybe its because I havent gotten the true ending.5. I didnt address this in my first game of the series, but I am gonna do it here. Aumm listen... if the game cost $20.00, tell me why the DLC  collectively cost as much as close to $100? Maybe unnuh lose some screw up there while adding price to those things. Like 10 dollars for voices. Eeeeh, really fam? come again.Overall great game that I would recommend to others interested in JPRG games.P.S NO I DID NOT RECEIVED LE GAME FOR FREE! BOUGHT IT WITH ME OWN MONIES..sorry didnt untick the box and cant edit that."
