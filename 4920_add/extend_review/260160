I even picked it up on complete faith, based on the description and such, touting it as being ""inspired by classics such as Jak and Daxter and Banjo-Kazooie"". It's plainly using nostalgia to sell. The visuals, characters and soundtrack sure do, but something that went unnoticed during development phase, something important that all platformers need, that i don't think Mimimi figured was a big deal. But it is.The gameplay and controls of the game, totally clash with what it's trying to be 'inspired by'. A 'classic 3D platformer' has jumping puzzles, jumping skills to traverse difficult sections, and tight controls. This game has none of that. Instead it went for the 'Assassins creed' approach. Or as i like to call it, the ""Lazy platforming' approach. You hold a button to auto-jump off of platforms. Yes. That's right. Not only that, there are literally no jumping puzzles you can't solve just by holding the button and a direction. This makes the entire game and indeed, the entire selling point, totally moot. The game treats you as a platforming idiot. Unable to simply time your jumps. This takes all the fun out of the game for me, and probably, alot of you. There is no exploring by platforming or doing tricky jumps here, no sense of reward by finally landing that perfect set of jumps. They give you a beautiful looking world to explore, but limit and hand-hold you into every little thing you do. I wish i could get my money back, but as i said, i really tried to like it.The entire game is just one huge slap in the face to my nostalgia, its like the developers didn't even play the games that 'inspired' them. I felt like the game was treating me like a total idiot that needs to be hand-held. I hope this doesn't become the norm for modern 3D platformers. Don't be suckered in, just play the old 3D platformers, and let this modern garbage rot on steam."

Sure it's a beautiful game and even though it claims inspiration from great 3d platformers\collect-a-thons of yore, a platformer in the strictest sense of the word it is not as it doesn't have a jump button. There's way too much automatic nonsense happening in this game for me. For instance, to run across some platforms on water you hold RT and watch an animation play out. To climb a rope\vine\ladder you hold RT and watch an animation play out. To swing across some gaps in the air...take a guess at what you do, if you said carefully time your swings and press jump at the height of your swing you'd be fkn wrong as all you're doing in this game is holding RT and watching some animations play out.I'm glad that this game was inspired by the games listed on it's marketing description however it does very little and I mean very little with those inspirations. Now I was not expecting a clone of those game because that'd be extremely stupid, but I was at least expecting an enjoyable 3d platformer but all I get is a mountain of dialogue (which may be good who knows), dodgy controls, boring\repetitive combat and some automatic platforming.Verdict:I doubt I'll finish this game so buy at your own discretion. Hopefully A Hat in Time delivers."

It will delve into the dangers of excessive paranoia and fear of the unknown, tell the story of a man who wastes his life away at the bar instead of trying to solve all his problems like a man, and of course that there is nothing wrong with helping someone that you normally aren't really friends with.. In dark times, even the bullies that pester you need your help, and in turn can become a close friend.Combat, while it still is button mashy, at least gets a bit more interesting as you progress through the game, getting new powers that allow you to switch it up a bit, such as the power to stun a large enemy so you can deal a critical blow from behind, or even cause them to suddenly start running in fear off of a cliff or into spiked bushes of death. Late in the game there is even some enemies that require you to vary your attacks in order to beat it, so you can't just button mash your whole way, as well as the fact that sometimes you need to use a later-earned ranged attack to deal with other threats, giving you something different besides jush mashing the left mouse button.However, the game most certainly is no Banjo & Kazooie or Jak and Daxter, what with the collection element of the game being completely optional and only used for small bonus content, nothing really big (unless you like lookin at concept art), and the platforming being mostly simplified (I say mostly, because there still is a few segments that require your input, such as jumping during rail grinds and the general timing of platforming). Rather, this is more of a 3D semi-platformer bawler of sorts, and for the kids, I think it is a fairly decent little game. Not only does it leave you to ponder a few things afterwards about the content it tackles, but it also is a fun title full of life and personality, and a few chuckles here and there.. For the hardcore sort, however, maybe you might wanna look elsewhere, because while there is some challenge in this game, I don't think it'll be enough to keep more serious gamers engaged for long, as indicated again by the negative reputation this game sadly has."

The only downside is there's an opportunity for a sequel/post-endgame that ties into the lore pertaining to what a Tinker's role is mentioned in the game that they never take advantage of.Presentation: 10/10Wonderful cohesive visual style throughout the game. Bonus points for alterable visuals through unlockables.Sound: 9/10Good soundtrack overall, definitely worth picking up.Controls: 7/10The controls are a bit challenging, however it's forgivable due to the amount of attacks and skills loaded into the gameplay.Gameplay: 8/10This game is just very fun to play. One of the biggest criticisms is the semi-automatic platforming but it's not so much a platformer as it is puzzles and fighting. The gameplay has a great feel, the puzzles are fun and diverse, and even the enemies gradually level to require new strategies to take down.Lasting Appeal: 7/10There are collectables, unlockable graphic modes, cheats, and concept arts, hidden secrets that unlock achievements and more. Aside from adding DLC or more story elements once the game is completed, it has more content than you would expect and plenty to keep gamers returning. A level select mode lets you return to your favorite parts, each unlocked upon completion.Overall: 9/10Definately pick it up. This unique game is worth it, especially if you're a fan of N64 and PSX era adventure games."

,Not Recommended,260160,29595667,Posted: 30 January,all,Scopedog,"It feels kind of harsh to judge a game on what it isn’t rather than on it’s own terms, but like many others I bought City of Colours on the strength of the description. Inspired by Banjo Kazooie and Jak and Daxter. If you’re going to namedrop to sell, then you can’t be surprised when you’re compared directly to those games.This game shares almost nothing with those classics except for a twee art style. Those games are defined by platforming, collectables and an open structure, where players can take on challenges in whatever order they wish. The Last Tinker is an entirely linear game with no jump button. Platforming challenges consist of nothing more than holding a trigger and moving the stick forwards, similar to Zelda games – it’s almost entirely automated and thus entirely unengaging.The rest of the game consists of tepid, unchallenging puzzles punctuated by perfunctory batman style combat. Occasionally there’s an utterly rote boss fight. I know this is a game aimed at children, but even by those standards the game is coddling and witless. It falls in that uncomfortable middle ground where it’s far too childish for older kids whilst being too mechanically complicated for little ones. If you’re wanting a 3D platformer of old, give this one a miss – it is not what you want it to be."

Even though the game has a childish nature to it, there are many deep rooted themes that reflect today's society in America. I usually write lengthy reviews with in depth reviews, commentaries, and discussions, I'll keep this one simple and short, much like the game.Pros:Visually nice, reminded me of those old school games, and stuff like Paper Mario.Interesting storyMoral themes reflecting current life and views in AmericaCons:Combat is a little repetitiveShort game (quality over quantity though)Little to no replayabilityOverall, I read quite a few reviews that says the game is perfect to play with a young gamer. I am inclined to agree, however, there are small tidbits where adults will have just as much fun playing it as a kid would. It's like a Pixar movie: designed for kids, but perfectly playable and enjoyable for adults.The only real downside for me is that I do no think the game is worth $20.

It has a light hearted story but still has an important theme that it shows in ways that haven't been seen much since the beginning of the ps2 era. Playing through this gave me a lot of nostalgia for the original Spyro, Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, and Sly Cooper games. The controls are nice, even with a mouse and keyboard and it has a pleasant, even if somewhat youngish art style which just makes me remember the games that I mentioned before even more.As you can see from my play time, it is not a super long game, but I also didn't attempt to get 100% completion. The amount of time it takes does not take away from the fact that it is a very nice game to play. And during the 2016 Summer Sale it is only $4, which for those that worry about amount of play time compared to price, this should put that worry to rest.I definitely recommend it!"

Infuriating to the point of hating the game. I never found the game even remotely difficult, but I did find myself trapped because I managed to get on the wrong side of a gate, or wall, or be otherwise separated from something important that forced me to restart the level.This didn't happen once or twice.EDIT: There is a menu function that I was not aware of at the time of writing that lets you reset the player.I also think that the game needs to think about how it pitches itself. I bought the game based on the description, and the games that it mentions in that description. It isn't sufficiently reminiscent of any of those games for the references to be anything other than misleading.EDIT: The description has been changed.Patch the glitchesRewrite the description"

It's a bit of a PS2-era game in a PS4 world, especially in terms of the sparsely-populated world, but the imagination on display is satisfying, the story is quite sweet, and for a team of nine people, this is an excellent piece of work. The downsides are a slightly sticky control system (with a dodge which never quite works), and a very shaky framerate. But the upsides well outweigh those downsides.

It has small subtle elements of games like Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank, and Crash Banidcoot but more than any other game, it reminds me of Spyro. The gameplay, the progression, the story, the characters, the enviroment, the little annoying squeaky follower that talks on your behalf because your character is either a mute or an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The list goes on...Back in the day when games were short and simple this could fly but nowadays it is much harder to compete with modern games. There I both recommend and not recommend the game based on the following:-IF you never had a childhood (Probably adopted by sterotypical overachieving Asian parents) and never got to play Spyro or other games like it then this game is probably a waste of your time and money.-IF you did have a proper childhood (Thank your parents) and/or still are a child AND played similar games such as Spyro or whatever then I definitely recommend this. Let's face it, the older games seemed like classics because there was nothing better to play then and in many ways are just plain and simple great fun. In many ways those games are arguably better than The Last Tinker and actually have more to them BUT they don't make them anymore. If you're anything like me you've milked those childhood games dry over time through Playstation 1, Playstation 2, Playstation 3 HD remakes and even Playstation emulators. The Last Tinker is the closest you'll get to reliving those types of childhood games.That nostalgia aside (the main selling point), the graphics aren't bad. The game has a very colourful, vibrant look but that is also due to the story line. No framerate issues that I've noticed nor any pixelation. No bugs or glitches. Simple controls, enemies and powers to learn. Decent soundtrack. Replayable missions if anything was missed. Easily completed steam achievements. Fun unlockable visual modes (Small heads, Big heads, Black & White, Colour Reverse, Mirror World, God Mode, Arena). No real overall downside to this game, only things that not appeal to your game tastes.P.S. This is my first review. Sorry if it was unhelpful, unagreeable or too long."

Combat is pretty smooth, and sometimes can be too easy, but if you put the game on hard you'll have a good challenge anything higher will make you go nuts trust me. Characters are cute and remind me and couple of my buddies of viva pinata, but with much more color hence the name no pun intended. However be aware that sometimes you will run into things like bugs, that has happened to me yet knock on wood, but the developers are very active as this game grows.As you get more and more items or powers challenges become really interesting and sometimes tedious. Might be because I suck at this game, but keep playing it because I the story is abstract and something I would've never expected especially for a game like this. There is a lot of light humor and it's great for a game like this. I would hope that this game gets released on a console like playstation, xbox, nintendo consoles because it would really work well.This game is solid and for all ages.

It reminded me of ye ol' Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank, where you have just a simplistic complication, but don't let that fool you as there is more to this game then it seems.Story:  Being one of the few members of the town outside the major districts, your little community takes in all kinds of color'ed people and the town acts as a neutral settlement for people afraid of their own districts. Majority of the game revolves around the complications each of the 3 colors present to one another;Redmost commonly known for anger and rage is well represented through the Red characters.Green, the curious types of people who turned coward, have more of a technological side with their robust defenses and how they live boarded up in their homes away from all the outsiders.Bluewas the trading hub of color, which in this world was the biggest product that everyone needed and used. Although due to complications they all turned sad and depressed.At the very start it may seem slow, but if you pull through the excellent tutorial that is given and move towards the big twist that even I did not see coming, the game draws itself a quite nice narrative.Gameplay:  The combat after you reach the fighting part of the tutorial seems very bland, sort of a button mash really to kill most of the enemies early game. But I digress as the further in the game you play you can purchase upgrades and combo's for your attacks and also increase duration of abilities. This allows for people with different playstyles to work more efficiently and perhaps change the gameplay to suite individual people.The parkour element, a MAJOR part of the game is very well produced. The smooth maneuvering of jumping around on boxes and planks really feels fluent. It may be hard to understand at first but once you get through the basic of how to jump around without stopping to look around it becomes a fun experience jumping around and exploring to find collectibles.Controls:  A combat/parkour game must have a big majority of the focus on the controls, without doing so it could make the game feel troublesome to control and overall a bad experience. From what I have played of the game using my Xbox 360 controller (Yes it supports xbox controller which is a big plus for me) it is very difficult to get used to from the average buttons. The interact button is what would strike most people as the most unusual, as on the 360 controller it is (Y), and you will see why it is as you progress through the game.The combat portion of the controls amongst the parkour is also very fun to play with. It has a dodge mechanic which seems very functional when needing to dodge attacks, and can also be used to initiate combos and reach platforms if performed correctly.Sumarrising Statement:  This game may not be as extensive as the old PS2 games that this game seems inspired off, it does bring a nuance in this genre with its unique parkour concept and the difficult combat found later in the game. I greatly feel this game is well worth the $4 spent and is a must pickup if it goes on sale for lower.8.5/10"

You will get your money's worth and support a worthy independent developer in the process.Pro:-Outstanding visually - the artwork and coloration are second to none;-Family oriented- utilizes a kid-friendly story to punch home adult themes;-Challenging at times, but maintains a casual feel with a great respawning system and fun upgrades.Cons:-A bit too childish at times - slightly corny with some elements of the dialogue;-Fights can become repetitive and mundane;-Control structure is basic and thus defeats some elements of challenge in traditional platformer titles- jumping, exploring becomes deceptively linear.I would have enjoyed the world to become open upon completion to track down the remaining paint brushes to achieve 100%.  The option exists, but you have to replay the game in stages, which will likely not happen for this player.To the developers- thank you.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time with your creation."

The writing's pretty lame (for kids though so it's not that big a deal), the soundtrack's decent, the presentation and look of the game world's actually quite good for the most part although the hero himself has probably one of the ugliest most unappealing character designs ever.While the game's pretty short there's a bit of replay value in the form of (mostly useless) upgrades and unlockable concept art, and despite it's short length it still feels dull and padded-out in places (eg. the level where the game suddenly becomes Diet LA Noire for a brief moment).Overall it's not a horrible game but it's not good either, and from a price standpoint, it's one of those games you should probably get while it's on sale since £16.99 for a 5 hour-long game is kind of a rip-off."

You auto jump like you would in Ocarina of Time and any other recent Zelda title, so you wont get any true platforming like you would in Banjo Kazooie or Jak & Daxter.)Due to that reason alone I think it's regulary priced a little too high at $19.99.

The game has a very colourful world and a linear as well as a somewhat childlike story but was still a pretty fun experience.

The further you get into the game the more inspirations you can see the developers adapted and put their own spin on it. If you like Psychonauts, Mario Sunshine, Banjo Kazooie, Jak and Daxter then this game is a must play. Everything feels nostalgic and really great.The story itself is surprisingly good and it was enough to keep me interested throughout. There wasn't a point when the story got in the way or pushed it in your face, it was subtle and benefited strongly from that.The visuals are super colourful and the art style is impressive also. The character and world designs never got boring. The game also supports colourblind mode in case you need that.The only negative I can think of is the combat, the game kinda forces you to use certain moves to kill certain enemies. Some of them will be shielded, some will just kill you in 1 hit. While it adds a lot of variety in combat it sort of gets repetitive. It has a combo system that's hardly implemented which is a shame. And seeing as fighting is what you do 80% of the time it kinda slows the pace down.You should highly consider playing this tho. It took me around 8 hours to finish on and off. Aside from the story there are collectibles to find also, you can go back to areas at anytime in case you missed them giving it more replay value."

This is more an adventure game than a platformer.Many people complain that this is not a difficult/challenging platformer. But it's not meant to be. It's a kid-friendly, easy platformer. So of course most of the platforming and combat is easy, and a lot of things are automated. The problem comes from the ""inspired by"" part of the description. This proves once again it's rarely a good idea to say your game is inspired by this or that because people will expect a very similar game and be disappointed.The game may be wrongly advertised, but that doesn't mean the game is bad. You just have to expect a fun and colorful, kid-friendly (both in terms of content and difficulty) adventure game with platforming elements.

At times, the camera can be a little clunky, causing loading issues, but the game runs really good for the most part.

It is a smooth ride with the occasional challenge here and there. Clearly the makers put in a ton of love and it shows this everywhere.Full review below.Pro+ Vibrant and colorful world, bitesize levels which fit together coherently.+ An easy and relaxing ride.+ Nice story with some clever morals (great for kids as well!)+ If you look carefully, eastereggs + collectables.+ Good mechanics around fighting and solving puzzles.+ Amazing soundtrack!Con- Not for people who look for the ultimate challenge.- Not exactly ""platforming"", this is automated platforming.Playing The Last Tinker was a great experience. It reminds a lot of the platform games of old, like from the N64 period. But let's get one thing out of the way straight away: this game took a simpler approach to platforming. In terms of gameplay this means 2 things.1: It removes all challenge for the real platforming fans out there.2: this means the game needs to deliver in different areas to make it up.In my humble opinion I would say it does the latter nicely. The charm of this game is unmistakeable. The game is set in one big colorful world split up in bitesize levels and is really fun to explore. At some point in the story the world is attacked by the ""bleakness"" which is draining all colors. This means you usually get to see 2 versions of a level. One filled with bleakness and one where it has been cleansed. It is rewarding to return the world to its original looks.The game has a great story which dares to touch our world's problems (racism for one). Also I could not help but start caring for the inhabitants. Even though communication is done via simple text clouds, it manages to convey the message how the creatures feel about all the happenings. Some are scared, others angry, others sad and hopeless. Not only does this fit with their colors, but it also makes sense and is relatable.Apart from the ""platforming"" the game offers just enough combat varience and puzzles to be entertaining. Think along the lines of opening doors by pressing buttons, lowering bridges, guiding helpful creatures with their own abilities (like exploding), finding keys or items, etc. Nothing new, but entertaining anyway.I also like how the creators experiment with different genre types (even trying ""noir"" at some point), and how they created some mini-games which actually complement the story.To top it all off, this game has an amazing soundtrack. Each part of the world is complemented by its own instrumental style. I especially liked the music from the noir level and the blue world in general.I would say this game is just long enough for what it tries to accomplish. I have had a great time and even felt some genuine emotion here and there. Technically this game also performs great. I had no bugs or issues at all, had steady FPS (though to be fair my pc is quite strong), and found the controller support excellent.As I wrote above, this game clearly shows the creators invested a lot of love.Therefore I would recommend The Last Tinker to any gamer looking for a relaxed experience."

The camera movement is jerky due to high mouse sensitivity, most of the audio is totally grating, the controls are awkward, and many actions are automated (such as jumping and climbing) so you feel limited. The guidance during gameplay is unbalanced, with too much at times and none at all others. But probably the worst thing is the health system. Though it claims you have a health bar and that after so many hits you die, when you take any damage at all, you respawn back at the last checkpoint. This makes progression maddening in certain areas. Even after fiddling with the settings and switching to a controller, any improvement was minimal at best. It definitely isn't worth full price; when I bought it, it was on sale for $5, but it isn't worth even that."

Don't take it as a bad thingAt first, the gameplay turned me off. It immediately felt really on-rails with its jumping system (pretty much automatic, uncontrolled). But it didn't bother me much after a short time.It took some time to learn that there were even enemy projectile impact indicators on the ground, and even when I learned it they were often difficult to see, especially when I didn't explicitly notice the enemy creating them was around.There were occasional performance problems. They took away from it only a little, but there was only one point where I felt I could blame death on it (The first double sign on a rail).There were only two points in the game where I felt a little cheated.First, when fighting one of the spawner mini-bosses, especially the first one as I did not have a ranged attack at the time, the boss would hit me very soon after I threw the last punch before they retreated and started spawning enemies again. It wouldn't have been an issue if I wasn't on the hardest difficulty, but I was, so I would die instantly and have to restart. Once I got the ranged attack I'd just avoid using melee attacks against it, though.As a rail was curving upwards and I'd jump too early, feeling like I should reasonably make considering the angle.On that note, cutscenes were generally unskippable (at least, as far as I can tell while playing), so dying repeatedly on some areas felt especially tedious.For being on the hardest difficulty, the game didn't feel too difficult. Maybe it was immediately getting used to the mechanics like that which made me feel that way. But there were only a few points where I would die (though usually at least a few times before I got through).The story was fairly predictable, but considering the generally childish theme of the game, my expectations were low. There was a single 'swear' that took me a little off guard.The game was pretty linear, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.Despite all of that, I enjoyed playing the game (especially the boss fights) and learning about Colortown and its inhabitants. I certainly didn't regret my purchase and would recommend it if these issues aren't too much for anyone."

The plot is cute, and kept me involved with just enough story. And the story, well thought out and didn't end how I thought, very nice from start to end.

One that apes nostalgia so much and one that really does bring back that feeling of classic PSX/N64 platforming? Anyone that knows me, knows that some of my favorite games growing up were Spyro, Gex, Sly Cooper, and Banjo Kazooie just to name a few. I absolutely adored 3D platformers when I was a kid. Seeing something like this pop up on steam out of the blue was a very real, very welcome surprise.In a world of countless dark, edgy brown and grey, dirty games, Mimimi Productions picked the perfect time to put this game out there. It's strikingly bold color pallette was enough to catch my eye, and after not only watching the start of a live stream with the dev, but speaking to one of the devs herself/himself who was nice enough to answer my many questions on the game, I knew this was a company that deserved every penny.Let's be extremely clear on this: This is a kid's game. There is no deep rooted meaning and the colorism ""Seperating of colors being bad"" undertone is about as subtle as a brick through a plate glass window. On the upside, it's not so overbearing that a young child could easily grasp it at first. There are plenty of references for long time gamers and a lot of enjoyment to be had with this title with little ones if for no other reason than it being a colorful distraction for a few hours.THIS PART CONTAINS A SPOILER...Now onto the one gripe that struck me right at the very end. Once you reach the end of the game, there's no going back to a fully united colortown to complete side objectives and such. To pick up all the brushes and ""complete"" the game. This is a pretty big gripe unfortunately because it kind of undermines all that you went through to get the town united. Not being able to see the fully realized colortown with all the districts means you don't really feel fulfillef at the very end. Sure you CAN go back to previous chapters and collect the brushes, but you'll be replaying the game essentially with the bleakness still around, again, undermining all the work you put in and the adventure you just went on. I don't know if this was a conscious decision or if it was a limitation, but it's the one gripe that I had to really dig down to see if it was worth mentioning, and I feel it is.NO MORE SPOILERS...So what are my final thoughts on the game? For the demographic it was made for, and for long time fans of classic 3D platformers I highly suggest picking it up if for no other reason than nostalgia. Unique character designs, bright and colorful color pallette, overall upbeat game with an interesting twist about halfway in. It's a really good game, and to hear that it's not only from an indie dev, but this being their FIRST indie game released? I fully support this group going forward and I can't wait to see what they make in the future!"

It claims to hark back to 3D platforming collectathons such as Banjo Kazooie and Jack and Daxter, but collectables are not important at all, and are sparsely hidden as well. Also, there is no jump button, so it's hard to call it a platformer. The majority of the focus appears to be the combat and light puzzle-solving. The pacing is really slow, and the combat is simple. Early on a quest is for a (15?) hit combo, which can be done with a single button. Later on, attacks do get ""color"" added and become more complex, even if just by having three varients of the same punch (to be clear though, I only have one color right now, so while I have no reason to believe it will get better, or that other colors will be more varied, I can't for certain tell you that it stays boring.)  You can also use the game's currency to buy upgrades, but from what I've seen, it isn't anything exciting, nor anything I found more usefull than to mash the normal punch buttons. Maybe I'd like it better if I knew what I was getting into from the start, but even taking that out, the game isn't engaging to me as most actions are completely automatic, such as platforming ""assassin's creed"" style, I guess you could call it."

Just picked it up on sale and am enjoying it a lot more than some of the reviews would have you believe. Me and my nephews are having a blast with it.I've read a lot of people complaining about the jump thing, which isnt really a huge deal. I've seen some reviews stating that the autojump goes against everything they were trying to recreate, but you can use something as inspiration without copying everything that thing did down to every little detail. The auto jump while not ideal works in this game and thats important to note.I would say this game set out to recreate the feeling of games of old and in that respect they certainly succeeded.While I have yet to get anywhere near finishing the game I can say without a doubt this will be a title I enjoy until the end. From a development team I've never heard of this is an amazing job on a great game."

I would recommend this game if you enjoyed games like Crash Bandicoot or Banjo-Kazooie!--------------------------------------------------------------------The game (to me) is somewhat short and the gameplay is very one-directional. You can go back and play previous stages but I haven't delved into that aspect of gameplay yet as it says that all progress you've made on that file ahead of the stage you wish to replay will be lost. I'm not sure I want to have to '100% collection rate' beat the game from the start just to play a later stage with some of the things you unlock from the ""collector"" items in this game.The combat, to me, felt very gimick driven with each new enemy basically having to be defeated in a very specific way or in some cases take excessive damage while you're only able to get hit by them once or twice before you're about to die. Which (to me) made each combat instance feel like a mini-boss."

As you can see, I only played 30 minutes but that was enough to tell me that this description is false advertising and that is why I really dislike this game.Other that that, here are the bullet points:- I can see ""inspiration"" from LittleBigPlanet, which this game's art style and overall theme feel like a cheap knock-off of.- I was not looking forward to several more hours of the story, which I imagine would be like watching a cheap after-school special on racism on a loop for hours. Koru seemingly has no personality, he's just automatically great because every person you see says so, except for the antagonist.- THIS IS NOT A PLATFORMER!! It's a somehow more boring version of the traversal system from Assassin's Creed. Hold a button and move the joystick.- Combat is not at all challenging. It's button mashing and it feels weak.Summary: I feel like this is a game designed for younger players, but the developers are trying to cash in on the nostalgia of people that are a lot older than that.

Missions are do this or that and seemed boring. Overall, just a boring game. I've beaten Jak and Daxter 5 times and I could play it again while still having fun.

,Recommended,260160,11217230,"Posted: 13 July, 2014",all,Electronic Toaster,"I notice that The Last Tinker: City of Colors is often compared to Banjo-Kazooie and said to be a platformer. I don't think this is an accurate comparison. This isn't to say that The Last Tinker is bad. Only that other games bear a better comparison. I think that a better comparison is to a game like Beyond Good and Evil, or perhaps 3d Zelda titles. I hope the reason for this comparison will become clear through the review.First of all the platforming in The Last Tinker is context based and not free. You cannot actually jump at will in this game. You run at edges and leap to the next designated spot.  The challenge is not based on jumping onto difficult platforms, but on timing your leaps between platforms. The platforming is more a puzzle than a test of dexterity. The platforms can be considered more a mode of transport than the main challenge.What you do spend a lot of you time doing is fighting. The combat is basically puzzle based. You have a couple of unique strikes, which are useful against certain enemies. You often have to choose which enemy to defeat first, and use your skills to keep the other enemies off you. The combat feels a little strange. You can approach the same battle in slightly different ways, with one time earning your death and the next trouncing everyone quickly. I believe this may be the result of the puzzle emphasis on combat. If you abuse your somewhat very powerful abilities you will win. If you go in as a traditional brawler and don’t abuse your abilities, you won’t do well at all. What I mean is that the combat is not nuanced. You solve the combat, you don’t win through strength or dexterity. This would make it similar to the platforming in that the challenge is solving the situation. Enacting your solution is usually quite easy.The checkpoint system is generous, and unlimited. So any frustrations that may be felt are reduced to very minimal levels.Puzzles are the fundamental challenge of the game. This is experienced through both the above mentioned combat and platforming, and also normal puzzles you would normally encounter during an adventure game. Challenges are usually not highly dexterity based.  You quite often interact with other characters to solve puzzles. The puzzles are quite varied. While no puzzle is particularly difficult, each puzzle meshes very well with the universe. In a sense, you learn about the world through solving puzzles.The overall story is very important to the structure of The Last Tinker. Every level feels like it advances the plot, and feels like a natural extension of the previous events. The exploration is linear. There is no hub and there are no levels that branch off. There is a continuous story. The levels are chapters in a story.  This means that the gameplay always feels wedded to the world you are exploring. I never felt like anything I was doing was game logic or ‘just because’ you needed something to be in the way.You spend a lot of the game surrounded by other inhabitants, and this goes a long way towards making the world feel believable. You interact with, if not every inhabitant of the world, what feels like enough inhabitants to understand and care about the world. And the main character feels like his contribution to the world is defined by a heroism of spirit, and not of being the strongest person around. The other characters you interact with achieve a balance of being very defined, and in a sense extreme, but also being human and relatable.The story is very well told. It has a fairy tale quality, which means that while the story is not complicated, it does demonstrate something fundamental about humanity.I highly recommend this game to people interested in an adventure built on a fairy tale style story and immersion in a fantasy world. If you are looking for a intricate gameplay based game then it is better to look elsewhere."

I have played it for two hours total, and that's all the game might get out of me.That sounds hypocritical to you? Let me explain.The games environment is wonderful, the combat is simple yet fun. The characters are also fun and I just had a smile on my face for the most part. The game mechanics are fun and has a bit of relaxation to them yet it gives you a bit of adrenaline from time to time. I enjoyed the story thus far too.The problem is, if you have any controller other than the 360 controller, you're going to have a bad time starting this fun game. The first time is fine, second time maybe too. But after that, you won't be able to load your game. They have a major bug with other controllers (Xbox One for me) that forces you to scroll through the menu to the left constantly. Also any other settings you'd want to change with the controller are impossible. I set my controls in the beginning to controller only and even if I pull out my Xbox One controller, to try and navigate, I won't have much luck. Some button placement is also not properly linked with any controller other than the 360.So if you have a 360 controller, you'll love this game. If you have any other controller, it's better to skip the buy and wait for the company to fix it. I will just hope they'll fix it. Because it might be a game I'd want my future kids to play, but there won't be any 360 controllers around anymore by then, so they game would literally die out at one point."

Well, I'm not saying it isn't fun. It's not a bad game at all. If it wasn't for the not so minor issues, it would have definitly been better.What issues may I be refering? The main problem has to do with the camera sensetivity combine with the amount of colors in the game. For some people, it may not be a issue. For those of us whom falls well within the realm of percieving every darn possible colors and more, at once, it is quite painful to look at this game with it's rapid camera movement. Lowering the senstivity didn't help much at all.Droping the senesitivity all the way down would made the game impossible to play since the camera rotation becomes too slow. If I was to suddenly turn Kuro around and walk in a differnet direction, there would be several second of not seeing where the charater was going due to extremely low camera rotation. Puting the sensitivity up just by one click from the lowest is still pretty fast. It rapid speed isn't only in the camera rotation, but it in every motion you make. Come on, why is there no inbetween impossiblely slow and omega fast.I understand the Kuro is suppose to be fast, but that camera movement causes all the colors to vibrate more than it needs too.The second issue, I ran into, was the delay from the players excuting the Input to the event being perform by the character. For example, after pushing the jump button or key I would expect it to jump right away and not 1 second later. I can understand giving a bit of delay for various reason, but 1 second of delay is too long. This makes the game less enjoyable when you know you need to jump or rotate to dodge, but nothing happens and you took damage.Those were pretty much the only issue I had. It took awhile to complete the game since I had to stop playing, quite often, to readjust my eyes.As for the story, is pretty much a familar story. A story of segeration, and how an insprational figure helped unified the people. The approach to the story was a intriguing one. There seems to be an hidden messages in the story base on how the story was told. Of course, this message may not have been intended, but it some how worked it's way in.Oh Conspiracy!Would I recomend this game? Sure, why not, it's a good game after all.

I was severely disappointed to find that I am glued to the ground and that the platforming is simply holding down a button. The game is incredibly simple and easy. Combat is braindead, the path is extremely railroaded, and collectibles aren't very difficult to find for the most part. Because you are glued to the ground and the paths are railroaded, you will often find the collectibles right in front of your face. The ""specials"" I have gotten have mostly gone unused, as they are unnecessary (unless the game requires them to be used). Your ""life"" and ""health points"" are pointless considering you respawn about 2 feet from where you once were due to generous checkpoint placement, and the fact that there isn't a ""gameover"".However, the game isn't a bad game. Being simple and easy does not mean that the game isn't fun. Contrary to this, I have been thoroughly enjoying the game once I got out of the ""This isn't a 3D platformer"" mindset. The designs of the characters are very interesting and cool (you can't tell me that Koru's scarf isn't awesome). The art and music both are beautiful! Colors are vivid and lush, sound effects are satisfying, and the story is interesting enough to me that I want to know what happens. And even though the combat is incredibly simple and easy, I still have fun with it due to the sound effects, colors, and animations. The animations being incredibly fluid and fun to watch.Some complaints, other than ""too easy"" and ""not a platformer"":The sound that Lil Bomber makes when affected by Green isincrediblyuncomfortable and disconcerting. Especially the ones he makes while still being held.The whole meeting with Blue Spirit is incredibly abrupt and jarring. There's only a couple lines of text before he joins you, with nothing being said by Green or Red Spirits.The lack of using dodge to get off of jumping puzzles being used. RB allows you to dodge off of ropes, spires, pillars, and other such things that you autojump on to. However, not once did I find this ability effective in finding a collectible or advancing along. I have yet to complete the game or even beat the game, but I doubt it will come in handy in the future...Most other complains fall under the ""too easy"" and ""not a platformer"" categories. But once again, this game is still good. It's fun, it's relaxing, and it's pretty to watch as you play. It's a great game for a younger audience as well as those not very skilled. I can definitely recommend this game to those who can sit back and enjoy a simple romp through an interesting and beautiful world."

It is clear throughout the whole game how the previous era of platformer games has influenced this game in its design. While it at times really did remind me of games like Spyro and Ratched & Clank, it still managed to keep an own sense of style and expression. Despite me having a bad first impression during the first hour of gameplay, the game managed to charm me over and I really enjoyed playing the rest of the game.ProsAbsolutely charming game with charming characters and charming environments.Love how the game used the contrast between chaos (sensory overload) and calm to help pace the game and setting the mood.Love the way the story as well as the visual story was developed and told during the later parts of the game.I liked the level progression. I didn’t feel like I was backtracking and the levels, although rather confined, always allowed for some extra exploration.ConsBad first impression. You, as the player, was dropped into a confusing place of sensory overload, utter chaos and fetch quests.The lag! I had some serious frame rate drops and had to toggle the graphics settings and turn some stuff off to even have the game in a playable state.Clunky camera and controls which lead to some frustrating situations.Initial combat felt clunky and unresponsive.Game was not consistent in telling the rules.

Worth the 2 bucks(xD) I got it for during Winter sale.Numerous games come to mind playing this.Everything by Rareware, Psychonauts, Little Big Planet, Paper Mario. Yes, I'm using the ""it's like <all these great games>"" description that's usually a bit scammy. I'll pick one then, it's like Beyond Good and Evil. Linear, not terribly complex, but downright fun.- It's not a platformer.- Don't expect puzzles. It's just lever-pulling and repeating a sequence.- A bit of (self-)referential humor at times, don't expect a lot.- Linear as all hell, except for a single optional collectible. There's also gems to buy moves with(or as a key item at start), but that happens automatically. There is no backtracking whatsoever. ~8 hours.-- Possible because of this, an excellent hint system. Just ask your buddy and he will fly almost the exact route you need to go.- Combat is not difficult,except for the unlockable, optional arena. I went for the ""instant death"" difficulty, thinking it to be a cooler name for ""nightmare"". It is not. Things will gib you continuously, even things that only knockback on other settings. Does not make the game more fun, just more annoying. No achi either. Just don't.-- The cargo rails. What I thought was a scenic trip through the wonderfully crafted world was instead a quick time event in disquise. Especially on instant death. Bah.-- Enemies(outside of boss adds) do not respawn. Even instant death is quite doable, the regular levels. Bosses still require a lot of trial and error until you completely know the attack pattern.-- You gather three colored powers over the course of the game,but they are simply damage, fear and stun. The first quarter of the game is simply""hit it until it dies, dodge if it attacks"". They also give a superpower usable once a bar is filled. But this doesn't add any depth to boss fights, as they still need to be hit X times in the weak spot.Power, Time Stop and Invulnerability. Bosses remain vulnerable until a third of their hp is damaged, so Power nor Time Stop work. Layme.- It's cartoony. Some people use that as a pejorative, but it's simply a description. Like romantic comedy. Some people never like romantic comedies, most people need to be in a mood for it. Just like with cartoony. It feels cell-shady, everything is bright and un-brown.- ""Everything in this world is made of paint, paper and glue"", and it shows. Text balloons are in gamespace, some are static, so you can view a textbox from the side to see that sinusoid cardboard thing, and you can view them from behind where they're blank.- The world is beautifully made. There's dissapointingly much lore, as you don't ever see e.g. the inside of a dust refinery, or a rainbow factory where colors are made. On the other hand, you can often peer in a random direction and see detail without the quests ever taking you there.- The characters. Banjo-Kazooie-like creatures just ramble on in their voice, gesturing, no matter their actual text. Each race has a ""voice"", and some unique characters have their own. There's quite a few different expressions. The three races look nothing alike, not just their bodies but their districts as well, each has their own architecture. Especially the spirits look great, Green was amazing.It was a fun experience. I loved the characters, I giggled, I facepalmed at the cheesy story, I enjoyed the scenery, I raged at instant death(just don't)."

,Recommended,260160,19531409,"Posted: 6 December, 2015",all,Crabapple,"Review:The Last Tinker: City of Colors has got to be one of the best indie games I have ever played. It isn't the most difficult of games and not necassarily the best of the indie franchise, but it certainly has had some work put into it and it deserves to be recognized. And with that, let's get into this review.So to kick things off, let's talk about the story. The main character that you play as in The Last Tinker is Koru, who suprisingly enough, is the Last Tinker. Weird right? The place that this all takes place in is Colortown, where three factions of people live together; blue, red, and green. A race is held anually in Colortown and Koru always competes. But the night after the race, things go terribly wrong. A purple color element turns the world into bleak or in other words, white and gray. Now Koru most bring together the factions and their elements to stop the bleak from destroying Colortown. Although I may have left a few things out, I personally though that this story was although very simply and relatively childish, it was still fun and I thought it added to the game very well. Not much else to say about the story. Next, the gameplay.Ahhh, 3D platformers. Oh how you made my childhood amazing. This game is very reminiscent to me of Spyro: Dragonfly Dojo and Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The gameplay is sort of an action 3D platformer. You also get new abilities for each element you collect and for each move you buy from the fighting expert. The combat was pretty unique too because once you got further into the game, you were given many options on how to take on your enemies with the power of the elements granted to you. There are also puzzles which you know aren't the most challenging thing, but you know... they're there :P. Now one thing I am sure people will want to know about this game is what are the controls like and should I have a controller? Gladly, the keyboard controls are good and a controller is not necassary. If you are a pleb like me, you don't have a controller for PC games. Althought the controls felt a little bit contradictory near the start of the game, you eventually get a good feel for them. Onto the look of the game!Honestly, this would probably be the main reason I like this game so much. The visuals are absolutely amazing in terms of variety and color. And that is what made me want to play it that much more, so I can restore color to Colortown so I can see the color again :D. Now of coures the game isn't exactly on my top list of best graphics, but man these visuals just draw you in that much more.The last thing I would like to issue is how the game is $20 at original price which brings up the question, is it worth $20? Well my personal answer to that question is no, no it is not. Although all of the things I said were good for the most part, this game is not worth $20. My first reason for it not being worth that much is because the game doesn't really have enough playthrough time and if you'd ask me, the game doesn't have much replayability. I consider my self a relatively average platform player and my playthrough was only like 5 to 6 hours. With $20, you could go buy something you can pour many hours into like *cough *cough Rocket League *cough *cough. I got the game on sale, so I would say I got worth out of it. Honestly, my best calculation of worth for gameplay is $2 = 1 hour. The second reason I would say this game is not worth $20 is because of the fact that there is much more time and value you can get out of 20 dollars. Unfortunately, this $20 price tag for a game that was released a little over a year ago for an indie game with a small amount of play time just makes the game not quite worth it. If you can get it on sale, definitely consider getting it because it is most certainly worth it if you can get it like that.Overall, my experience with this game was fantastic and worth the amount of money I put into it. If you can get this game on sale it is most definitely worth your money and I reccommend it. Please don't actually pay $20 for this game though if you have value in mind.Overview:Pros:1. Colorful2. Fun Gameplay3. A Simple, Yet Charming StoryCons:1. Not Worth $202. Lack of ReplabilityFinal Score | 8.5/10"

The story was pretty unique in regards to the characters but was pretty predicitable. The movement of the character is pretty simple, there are some jumping and climbing mechanics in the game that are extremely simple to use, I mean to jump from ledge to ledge you simply hold down the sprint buttton and it jumps for you. I played it on the hardest difficulty, that is one hit is Insta-Death which is frustrating but makes it really addicting. Overall I encourage you to purchase it when on sale as I did, I don't think the game is worth the $20 price tag, but I'm a fairly cheap human being who doesn't like paying full price for most things. I got a little over 13 hours of play time and got all the achievements for it so if 13 hours of playing is worth $20 to you, by all means try out this game."

The controls and especially the camera can be a bit annoying at times, I too would have liked if there was actual platforming, but I think the movement is done well enough overall. One thing that's also worth mentioning is that this does have its infuriating moments, where you will die seemingly for no reason until you understand the unintuitive logic of the game, but these are quite rare and usually the game is rather easy (though there is a difficulty setting).All in all it's a great game that reminds me of games I really liked on my GameCube and that just don't really seem to get made for PC."

But why the quotation marks?Most complaints seem to be that it has no real platforming, as it is all done automatically while holding the jump button, and that apparently makes it a bad game because it's not like the games it says it's inspired by.However, that is pretty much the only thing missing, but even then, it's only a problem if you're closed-minded enough that it stops you from caring about what the game IS.The world and characters are beautifully colourful and varied. Cartoony looking, and yet still so detailed and smooth. Playing this game is like eating candy with your eyes!The gameplay is fairly linear and easy, but addictive. While I can appreciate the desire for the accurate platforming of old (I love the PS1-2 classics myself), the auto-jumping helps the game flow nicely, while you focus on exploring, and figuring out how to proceed through obstacles, with occasional small puzzles and alternate paths. There are also multiple collectibles hidden in the levels, which unlock fun little extras, like big head mode, concept art, and more!The combat, while simple on the surface, grows more complicated and fun as you learn different attacks and powers, and encounter new enemies that require different strategies to defeat.And finally, the story is light hearted without being childish, yet the theme is deep in ways that are very clear.So don't focus on what it isn't, look at what it is. When a game is inspired by something, it doesn't need to be 100% like that something in every way in order to be a worthwhile and memorable experience."
