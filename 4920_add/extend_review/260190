Yes, the game tecnically not so good ( ""torn"" animation, ugly models and flickering textures and etc), but unique style of this game overcomes most of disadvantages.

Gameplay is dated. The story fits with the game and does not feel like a waste of good talent. The graphics do not look bad ps2 quality. The music and the art is true to the graffiti lifestyle. This game is fun and may even inspire some to make art as it did for me. This game works best with a Xbox controller and is working fine on windows 8.1.

,Recommended,260190,10168226,"Posted: 19 May, 2014",all,MCofDiablo,"I played Getting Up a long time ago, but I remembered that there was not a game like this one. It is a quite unique mixture of platforming/climbing + fighting the enemies using your combos and weapons + graffiti + some stealth actions.Pluses:+ very interesting story. You play as Trane who wants to become famous, to get up, but later you get into political intrigues and scandals and become a rebel!+ Graffiti! There are lots of styles to choose from.+ Atmosphere of anti-utopian city. There are guards and patrols who will shoot or try to apprehend you as soon as they spot you.+ Music! It is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. Songs vary from hip-hop to hard rock!+ CGI cutscenes. There aren't many of them, but they are very well done.+ Voice actors. Rosario Dawson, Giovanni Ribisi, Brittany Murphy and many other famous people gave their voices to different characters.Minuses:- Not very comfortable controls. Your character sometimes just doesn't want to do what you want him to do. And yes, use gamepad. It's just better.- Stealth. I love stealth games such as Splinter Cell and Deus Ex, but here it is just poorly executed. It is not obligatory, but you won't survive otherwise.All in all, solid 9 out of 10! Try it."

When ""underrated/overlooked games"" come up, this is always in my top 3.Even if you didn't play it when it first came out, it's a good freedom fighter/uprising game; you might find the graffiti a little repetitive but there are so many (styles of) tags to spray, it's fine. The combat is simple but fun as well.Some of the textures have seizures, breaking the immersion and some of the sound is muffled (remember it is a port from an old♥♥♥♥♥game); the little I've played of it has shown the transition from obsolete console to pc to be good enough.Charlie Murphy plays a white guy.EDIT 1: The main gripe with this game is the camera: at times, it will be impossible to tell while spraying if you're nearing too much paint on one point. A buffing motion is the best way to combat potential dripping.The next gripe after this is the difficulty: I haven't found an ""Easy/Normal/Hard"" function... Thankfully. I forgot that the fun to be had in this game was only part of the reason I incurred such hefty late-fees back in 2006; the other part was how unforgiving the mobs of officers and gangers are. Especially when using a controller and the Power Move (in this case, X,X,hold X) can only be accomplished with X,X,mash X.I stand by this being one of my favorite (relatively obscure) games ever - very few games are as tense as this. Attempting (and no doubt failing) to sneak around enemies is the calm part; bombing active subway tunnels, the trains themselves, the side of a building being panned about with an authority's spotlight... You very well might get up due to adrenaline...EDIT 2: Amusement Pier: No Checkpoints 'til after you bomb the water tower. Be cautious, especially of the wonky camera angles while on the tower. Do not pick up the bolt cutters until you dispatch the Vandal Squad around the corner.As with most ports I've played, the dialogue within cutscenes likes to cut out or even get rearranged. One scripted line will be interrupted, to resume after what was supposed to be its rebuttal, to be interrupted again by the next line... All I can say is enable subtitles and read fast.Andy D-ick plays a fat-pig-female-cop.EDIT 3: Adam West plays the chief of police."

,Recommended,260190,12439922,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,ownosourus,"Getting Up is a reference to getting your name up on the wall, not necessarily climbing up to huge heights to do so. But in Marc Ecko's new graffiti-laced action game, Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure, you'll have plenty of chances to do both. As a mixture of third-person fighting, Prince of Persia-like acrobatics, and frequent stops to get your name up on various surfaces around the near-future city of New Radius, there's a good deal of variety to the action in the game. But Getting Up has more to offer than just exciting gameplay. The story, dialogue, soundtrack, and look of the game all contribute a great deal to the flavor and authenticity of the package. The end result is an interesting and often-exciting adventure that should be appealing to most action-game fans, but will probably hold extra appeal if you're at all interested in graffiti and the culture surrounding it.The gameplay in Getting Up is usually structured like this: You get into a new area, and there are one or more primary targets that you have to get to and paint. There are also plenty of secondary surfaces that you can paint on to earn additional rep points, which figure into the game's unlockables.Painting in Getting Up is a pretty easy process that doesn't take a whole lot of skill. When you get near a surface that's part of an objective, an outline of your tag or piece will appear. You can change the size of it or cycle between a few different options, but then you hold down the paint button and go to work.While there's an element of stealth involved in Getting Up, there's still plenty of face-to-face, hand-to-hand combat to get through.Getting Up has a unique and effective visual style to it that gets across the look of urban decay extremely well while still doing justice to the enemy designs.If you happen to be at least slightly interested in graffiti, you'll get a lot out of the game. If you aren't, you'll probably still be able to appreciate a lot of what the game does, and you just might learn a little something along the way.Overall 7/10."

76561198049689075,Recommended,260190,34944216,Posted: 14 September,all,Bald Man,"An interesting and long forgotten PS2 game.Before I say anything name a game in your head where you play as a graffiti artist who tags his name across everything as he makes his reputation be known to a highly opressive government. Can you think of any besides Jet Set Radio? Well whatever the case you have to admit that this kind of game really unique in that feature.Marc Ecko's Getting Up is a game primarily made by a guy who said gamers should get up off their butts and buy his games, where you play as a 20-something year old male named Trane who wants to tag his name everywhere across the city just for the sake of getting his name up. All while he is doing this he faces a dangerous graffiti gang called the Vandals of New Radius and an opressive regime of ""peace-keepers"" called the CCK which is lead by the government to stop vandalism and defacement of property to build a better and clean way of life in the city of New Radius.Sounds cool right? Fighting your way to become the best graff writer in town while dealing with not only a rival graff gang but the government itself sounds like an alright idea yeah? How could they possibly make this a frustrating game with so many flaws it can't even really be called a gem? Well... they managed to somehow make it that way.See Trane moves like a 20 year old noodle with the brains of a 2 year old, he really is unlikable due to being so rowdy to control. The graffiti system is awkward to use and if you're playing with a mouse then the controls will really start to mess with you. The story is good at best and mildly interesting somewhere in the half-way point but at the end it leaves you hanging with what the f**k happened and what will happen leaving you confused at the end searching for possible answers. There are some objectives and levels that are just extremely frustrating to do and just aren't that much fun. While I'm on the topic of frustration here the later missions are f**king ridiculous in how hard they are, and also aren't that much fun since you have to focus all of your inner brain power to get past them. This port is also terrible and it is probably the worst port for the PC I have seen. There's also a whole bunch of other cons that destroy the game's likeness, overall not being that much fun in the long run.But for some unearthly reason I still love it goddamnit. It is likely due to nostalgia from playing it on the PS2 long ago but for some reason it is still fun to play when I feel like playing it, and a lot of the missions are really fun to go through, especially the first few levels and a few ones at the end, and for being a graffiti game in a genre that's not really explored especially nowadays it is pretty decent when you get down to it. The hip-hop soundtrack is simply incredible and really fits the theme of the game perfectly (RJD2 is in this for you hip-hop fans). The cheat codes are also really cool and are just a little extra treat when you might've finished the game.If I had a thumbs in the middle then I would click it, but since there isn't I'm going to have to reccomend it. Pick this up on a sale try not to bother with full payment since it might not be worth it, and if you do happen to have a console then PLAY IT ON THAT INSTEAD, since this PC port is really bad and full of technical issues. If you don't have a console, no worries, just find one of the many guides in the community on how to play with an Xbox controller."

,Recommended,260190,18133214,"Posted: 21 September, 2015",all,Little B Gaming,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHmUKNoxX9shttp://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Marc_Eck%C5%8D's_Getting_Up:_Contents_Under_PressureThe written review is way too long and can't post the whole review here, so you have to watch my video for complete information about the game.Art is a crime and the biggest criminals are graffiti artists. This is according to New Radius mayor and our main character Trane is about to become the most wanted person.I want to start with the things I don't like before I continue with story, gameplay etc. Firstly is the lack of any video options, beside resoluition, that you choose in a launcher. Secondly, you can't rebind in-game the keys. You have to delve in a file if you want to change them, but it's not necessary. Thirdly, mouse sensetivity is high and again you have to delve in to files to lower it. This applies for FOV too. Just check PCGamingWiki. Also I have some problems with the AI, but later I will cover it. There few small bugs, that are worth mentioning. In some cases there is overlapping voices or they are too quiet. In other, the game starts loading, when the cutscene is not entirly over. But the biggest bug I encounter is a flickering, when painting a graffiti. If you select restart in doesn't restart from the last checkpoin, but in the beginning of the level. I found that the hard way. Also it's worth noticing almost 1 minute loading times, when you enter a new level. Non of this is gamebreaking, it's just annoying and most of the problems can be fixed.So after I left all behind all the negative stuff, it's time to concentrate on the positive and from here to the end of this review, it's all that.The graphics are all right. It's 9 year old game, so they didn't age very well, but the game is definitely not ugly. People are jaggy, but the city or to be precise parts of the city are well made, vibrant, colorful, despite the “gray” situation. In the end, if you are turn off by graphics, you will miss a lot.You take the role of Trane, young man, who wants to make a name by become graffiti artist. Despite the protest of his grandmother, he runaway from home with that idea in mind. In the beginning Trane is making his way in the slums, where he grow up and  he paint in the wrong places and encounters Vandals of New Radious and their leader Gabe. Our hero is beaten by gang, but he get up and continues the make graffiti. But in New Radius artist like Trane are not welcome. What in the beginning is getting revenge on VoNR, soon becomes more complicated. While painting graffiti Trane faces the bitter reallity. New Radious is shiny outside and rotten inside. Mayor Sung wants to make the city to look prosperous. For this purpose he is using C.C.K. (Civil Conduct Keeper), armored police force created from the government, to suppress the free speech and people from the slums by using violence, as long as no cameras are around. Pretty soon Trane finds, that the Sung hands are “dirty”. Half of the game is making a name for Trane and the other half everything turns 180 for him and the graffiti is one of his ways to protest againts the corrupt mayor. The other is his fighting skills. The story is worth following, but don't expect something groundbreaking.Ah, sweet, sweet gameplay. It's a mix between PoP-style acrobatics, street fighting, stealth and painting graffiti.Trane likes to make graffitis not only on the ground level, but on high and dangerous places. Big part of the game is platforming. Climbing on outfalls, bridges, walking or hanging on ledges, bouncing from walls on so many different places. Don't expect from Trane to do wild acrobatic stunts like in PoP or AC. He feels heavy, but agile enough and I like this. Trane is regular guy, not some super hero.Fighting system is good. If you are coming from a game like Batman Arkham series, maybe you will be disappointed, but I love it. As a hole battles are little bit slow, but more stratigic. This is not Devil May Cry. You have a punch, a kick, combination of both, grabbing enemy, block and dodge roll. But that's not all. You have to change combos frequently and dodge roll, because enemy adapts and block your punches and kicks. But there is a “cure” for that. Under your health is the Power bar. While you make three hit combo, hold the button on the third press and this will break the block with a powerful punch or kick and make more damage. But the Power bar drains and there is two ways to restore it. Stun an enemy and make humiliating move or just hit him. Of course, you will unlock new set of moves for kicking, punching and so on. Grabbing is especially useful for dealing with powerful enemies. Figthing feels great. Trane doesn't know martial arts, just what the streets taught him. If you run into a 4-5 enemies, you maybe able to beat them. It's hard, but not impossible. It's better to stalk and eliminate the one by one. And when you get in a fight, watch when enemy will make move, then dodge roll and beat him. You can lock on a single target, but I find out if they are more, it's better not to do it, because your combos can hit multiple targets.There are available weapons in the game. You can find pipes, pice of wood, buckets, radio and others. They can change course of a battle. After few hits with, they break. I really like how Trane is picking items – by dodge rolling. This is the coolest way!!! No need to stop and picking it up and wasting time. Great idea!!!Here stealth is encourage. A lot of battle can be avoided, you don't get XP points from them. So, it's better to crouch, walk behind enemy and knock him down. There isn't some stealth mechanic, like sticking to a wall. Just crouch, hide or get somewhere high and wait for you moment to strike. You have to hold 2 buttons to knock enemy down, but either you have to do it extremely precise or i'm doing it wrong, because in a lot of situations I just start a fight. Probably it's my fault.Except fighting and platforming, big part of the game is painting graffitis. They are awesome!!! Their design is incredible! Through them you will gain reputation and unlock concept art, combos, graffiti and so on. While painting, you have limited time for doing it. In addition to that, you must not make drips. If you succeed with both, this will get you more reputation and unlock faster everything I mention above. When you start to paint, pressure in the can lowers and you have to stop to recharge When you enter a level, you have few main graffiti to paint and some optional. More you make, more reputation you'll gain. Other side objectives vary between writing, sticking posters (I hate them) and others to a wall, cars, doors.. Before each mission, you can choose your arsenal of graffiti, stickers and other. If don't want the game will change them for you, if you unlock them.For easier way to find all spots to hit, you have Intuition. Sometimes they are not easy to see. With a press of a button all the places you can paint are marked with “X”.The level design is awesome. The game is linear, it's not open world. Slums, factory for meat, bridge, warehouse and so on. All are greatly design, so you can climb where you need to go, to fight and to paint graffiti. Platforming is not a challenge. You just need to look around for a few seconds. Sometimes they are more wide open, other more linear. When you start a level your objectives will be shown. How you approach them, it's up to you to decide. But start with stealth. A lot of times levels a heavily guarded. There some that keep you on your toes, because of a time limit, other because of the design."

Has more depth, inventive gameplay, and a better soundtrack than most games of the modern era.Port is awkward; mouse sensitivity is an issue if you don't own a variable speed mouse. A similar problem to the port of GTA: Vice City. But does support a 1080x1920 res. so it does well enough.Maybe has nostalgia value only. It might be difficult for a newbie to overcome the awkward controls. But I plan on 100%ing this badboy again.Let the Mobb Deep play.""New radius used to be alive..."""

I have not really encountered a reasonnot to buy this if you are interested, nice graffiti focused title, released on steam to pay homage to the yesteryears ofgaming. It is crucial to remember that if you are a graphics snob, this may not please you, though the graphics appear tobe light years above the PS2 release, which come on, PS2 cannot be compared to PC, that's just stupid. Anyway. If youwere, or are into graffiti subculture. you cannot go wrong here, okay controls, if a controller does not work, or work foryou, the mouse and keyboard are not awful, nor the best. I guess you could simplify this statement, and say that thisgame has controls you must acclimatize too. I would recommend it, just give it some slack, PERSONALLY have notencountered issues, except minor things a simple reset for me fixed. The soundtrack is older mainstream rap, I justplay metal over it, or something else. It is fun to assault police, and vandalize things as they grow in ferocity.I am unsure how to precisely describe the controls, I have not played in  awhile, but I do not remember them beingterrible, nor the best. The story is about a graffiti artist named, ""Trane"", and how he rose through ranks of other graffitiartists, and he becomes the typical, ""Anarchists, and bane of authoratative jerks"". It was doing parkour when it was in atime period where it was new to the gaming scene, besides a FEW other titles that had it, it was not a thing yet.I would recommend giving this game a try, keep moderate expectations, either enjoy the game's story, which truly isNOT awful, but not a literary master piece either. Kind of like my reviews to some people. Ho ho ho.. F you....But all merriment aside, also a few cliche moments aside. Pick this one up if parkour/platforming, with a side of action,and... Vandalism???? Is your thing."

,Not Recommended,260190,17602070,"Posted: 18 August, 2015",all,themoonrises,"So first off Marc,the whole anti-establishment graffiti culture thing is tainted a bit when you put cynical product placement for things like Nokia N-gages and Apple Ipods in your game.Secondly, if you're going to have stealth in your game and have a stealth takedown then it'd be nice if you had it mapped to a single button so you aren't constantly trying to take down a guard but then either kicking the guy in the back or worse still doing an extremely loud kick behind the guard that doesn't connect and leaves you looking like an eejit.Thirdly, if you're going to have so much combat it'd be nice if your enemies didn't have seemingly unavoidable attacks.Fourth that lunge attack the guards make is awful not only is it immensely frustrating to be running away only to get lunged at knocking you to the floor it makes no sense. Are the guards part dog?Fifth, Russian sounding assassin lady who walks around wearing some sort of lingerie, fishnet stockings, knee high leather boots and a mini skirt AND talks in a faux russian accent. Could you be more cliched? Well, yes, you could have your elite super guards in leather trench coats.Sixth ""Art is illegal"" say the guards. In what world is tagging, AKA writing your name on things art?Seven, it is vaguely hillarious kicking a guy off of a buiding then watching as he stands bolt upright  on nothing and just drops. He doesn't fall mind, he drops. On a perfectly vertical axis.Eight, so you go through a level doing the repetitive as all hell minigame for graffiti (which you do aproximately several million times through the game) and then you get killed by an unblockable OP guard you get send back to a checkpoint and have to repeat All... of the damned graffiti minigame arts all over again, those collectables, do it again, those challenges. Again. Or you just give up and cry. It might be fine if their were more checkpoints, if you could trigger them twice, if the game was more fun, there weren't so many collectables and arts to do in the first place.For the love of god, don't play this, if you're already nostalgic for it then fine but it is an attrocious mess. It doesn't even support an xbox controller out of the box you have to change the config files for that.This may be the worst game I've ever completed. If you are considering buying it then personally I would hold out for Banksy's game."
76561198065877448,Not Recommended,260190,9347941,"Posted: 4 March, 2014",all,SweepingsDemon,"This game is a story-driven beat-em-up with stealth elements, although most of your time will be spent ""going over"" the graffiti of others. At its core, it has a fun concept. There is even a pretty wide variety of graffiti (your designs get more elaborate and varied with each chapter) to keep you going through the graffiti process. But there are three fatal flaws which bring this game down. First, the ""freeform challenges"" require you to write marker tags on things. They're boring as hell, and there is literally no reason to vary your tags. But you get reputation from it which is required to unlock things, so you feel obligated to do them. Second, there is a mixture between action, stealth, and platforming (reminiscent of prince of persia) which really isn't bad overall; however, there is a disproportionate amount of required stealth at certain points in the game with controls and interface that aren't designed for stealth. It's frustrating when you have no indication that someone will or will not see you and a good portion of the game is based on this. The final issue is the camera. It glitches around frequently. By frequently I mean pretty much all the time. As soon as you approach a surface the image will stop popping in and out, the camera will start shaking, or suddenly you will be looking in the complete opposite direction. There is camera control, but it doesn't work for some reason when you're near things.The final straw for me was doing a series of jumps with a group of guards below me when my character suddenly began walking off to the side and getting off the platform. I corrected this, at which point he immediately jumped into a wall and stayed there where the guards (who now saw him) could not kill him with their taser arrow things. Yeah I don't know what those are.TL;DR It's glitchy as hell."

There were some issues with the problems, that most people seem to have. The problem is that textures on walls and the groun would sometimes glitch. It did not make the game unplayable, but it was annoying to have this problem. Something else I did not like about it is balance issues in the progress of the game. The game would be REALLY EASY in some in some levels and be followed by a REALLY HARD level then go right back to easy.  Other than those two issues I really like the game. It had a good soundtrack. The graphics, when they working at 100%, were pretty good, especially considering when the game was made. I also like the level layouts. They truly thought about the design of each level and where to have you place your tags. I like how they had a stealth aspect to this game and a good fighting system.

This game is all about ""♥♥♥♥ the police."" but in a good way (Corrupt military police state city.), much in the same sense as Mirror's Edge except you beat people silly AND put your tags on everything, combat is also really good in this game. I really like this game, it's style and the message it portrays and the music is pretty good, most of it being licensed, from Jane's Addiction to Del The Funky Homosapien and Roots Manuva. I haven't played the whole game yet but as far as I've gotten I'd say it's a big recommendation from me.Some pros and cons:Game is obviously dated being that it's damn near ten years old but the dynamic shadows and textures are honestly holding up pretty well.-Game is almost impossible to enjoy with a keyboard and mouse, gamepad DEFINITELY recommended.+Gamepad support.-Gamepad execution could have been a lot better, there are no button prompts and it only uses DInput which gives the Xbox 360 controller trigger issues although the buttons assigned to each trigger do not need to be used at the same time ever, without button prompts the game is difficult to understand control wise. I hope the developers add Xbox 360 button prompts and XInput support just to make it feel more polished.+Game supports 1080p widescreen.-But the HUD and all 2D elements such as the pause screen and main menu are stretched.-I've also suffered audio issues, ambience and all sound effects not playing in cutscenes.In closing, Devolver, we NEED an HD remake of this gem with smoother gameplay, more music and perfect controller support.
