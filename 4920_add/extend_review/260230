,Recommended,260230,10805448,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,DarkNinja13,"An extremely amazing game truly unlike anything I've ever played before.  Valiant Hearts adds a human element to the game that is missing from a lot of these war games that we see and is a fresh break from the whole ""Kill kill kill"" mindset you need for those games.  The majority of Valiant Hearts is done through puzzles.  The player needs to find ways to navigate around in the game, and do it by using their smarts rather than their trigger fingers.  There are indeed parts where you do attack the enemies (you have to so they don't detect you and end the game), so it isn't just puzzles.  Each of the characters are very likable and have their own unique stories, motivations, and reasons for getting involved in ""The Great War"" - and the best part is that those reasons, like these characters, are all believable.Valiant Hearts also does well in capturing the nightmare that was World War I, and does it without graphic depictions of blood, gore and violence that is prevalent in games set in war.  In the final chapter of this game the full scope of exactly how brutal and bloody this whole sordid affair was becomes obvious (there is a part where you have to take cover from machine gun fire by hiding behind solid cover- a few piles of dead soldiers are used this way at one point).  There are also many very interesting facts this game presents about WWI that most players may not have known, so history buffs and fact lovers are going to be in for some good info.  In my opinion, it is not only good to see a game that is set in WWI when most game studios seem to prefer WWII (perhaps it is because of the ""noble cause"" of the allies in that conflict), but Valliant Hearts takes both an unflinching and unapologetic look at the first World War and presents something as vile as trench warfare in a manner that is much more palatable than a shoot 'em up sort of game would have been.Just a heads up, though: Valiant Hearts FORCES you to download and install UPlay.  This is a fact that is not READILY visible on the store page unless you have enhanced Steam (which I do not).  While that fact may not have prevented me from getting this game, I just don't want to HAVE to download a new DRM console every time I get a new game from a different publisher."

I couldn't have been more wrong.The game will last you about 5-6 hours, which is well worth the normal $15 that this game goes for. If you see this on sale for any less, buy it instantly.The game is simple to learn, with challenges that will stretch your brain, but once you figure them out you'll think ""My god, I'm an idiot"".The story of this game is the main thing that will keep you playing this game. You easily get attatched to the charecters. They will make you laugh, cry, worry, smile, and laugh out loud. There are plenty of plot twists to keep things interesting, but not so many that the story is hard to follow.The game displays plenty of historical facts about the time period, and place, that you are playing in the game. While you are motly never directly tied to the events except for a few level designs, it was refreshing to get some background information about the world, and the war, while you go through it.TL;DR version+great story+great characters and development+simple, yet challenging missions+realitvely cheap for what you're getting out of it+The BEST intergration with music that I have ever seen in a video game-first time I've cried over a video game since Mass Effect 3's revamped endings"

,Recommended,260230,17082390,"Posted: 16 July, 2015",all,TITOMOSQUITO187,"One of the best all around adventure story games released in the last few years. A mix of a beautifully composed musical score, stellar artwork, great story, impressive puzzles, and real life historical content. This game actually made me think about the collectibles and ponder the historical facts as much as I did the story at times.Set during World War I (The Great War), Valiant Hearts gives you a look at individuals in war and how this particular group of individuals finds themselves connected. A German man married to a French woman who is forced to go back to Germany and fight. His father-in-law forced to fight for France. An American who befriends the Frenchman. A female doctor that finds herself crossing paths with all of them. Then there is Walt, the war dog, who becomes their ally, friend, and savior at times. While they all may battle for different reasons, countries, or leaders, they all care for one another. They all find ways to help one another overcome struggles, support one another in troubles, and connect to one another as humans rather than enemies.While the art style is cartoonish, you feel immersed with its very stylized and life-like animation. Faces and body language are done well so that you can see the story without having to hear dialogue. Even most of the speech bubbles are only pictures to give you clues as to how to solve the puzzles, or where you should go. The puzzles that are incorporated into the gameplay are interesting and clever at times. They aren't overly difficult, but a few make you feel like you figured something clever out. They are easy enough to keep frustration low and you focused on the story.Besides puzzles there are quite a few action sequences. This makes the genre tip a bit away from a point and click adventure as it would seem from the outside. These action sequences aren't hardcore fighting, or anything extremely daunting, but there is a lot of interacting with objects and other people in the game to push it away from a traditional puzzle solving adventure game. You even have a pet dog named Walt that you can have fetch you items, pull levers that you can't do, or have him distract an enemy while you slip in and steal something you need. It adds a nice change to just simply having to solve puzzles in the old fashioned way. You can actually die in the game as well, although it is only about 2 seconds of time lost if you do. Dodging bombs, bullets, and even driving sequences become part of some action sequences that keeps you on your toes and gives certain battle heavy chapters more immersion. Then there is what many may feel is annoying, the doctor rhythm quick time event sequences. They aren't difficult to pass, but can seem annoying to some with slow reactions.Within the game there are dozens of collectible items that are some of the best collectibles for any game I have ever played. Each chapter has 4-6 of them where you must find items that are pieces of war memorabilia. You will find things from war helmets, dog tags, items that soldiers made themselves to pass time, and even things like bars of soap. Each items carries with it an explanation of its historical uses in the war. You will see some very interesting and thought provoking items here. Sometimes you will find old letters from soldiers to family, or wives. Everything is quite interesting and adds a lot to the overall feel of the time period and the war. Some of these items are even from contest winners who shared things their ancestors had with them during The Great War and were used in the game. All of these are materials and collectibles you will want to read, and find not for some Achievement and completionist ideal, but because they are just that interesting that you want to see what their story is. They put a human face on the war with a bit of a shared humanity and recognition. They make you consider what it was like to be a soldier based on the things they carried, and this is why they are such a great addition. These are items that we can understand because they are simple and we can put them into the context of how they were used while in the battlefield.On top of all these collectible items you get historical data that will explain the real life battles that you are playing in the game, talk about all aspects of war from the economics, farming, civilian life, military police, and many, many others. All this additional material is fascinating and a phenomenal addition to the game. Some of these items, or histories had me pondering war and just how horrible it must have been as a soldier in these battles. Trench warfare, the weather, barbed wire, the mud. Even the idea that they were fighting in mines underground where enemies would set explosives below them to have them crushed. They really tried to give you a sense of the reality of it in this material.Valiant Hearts is a complete adventure game that excels in all areas. It is a polished experience with lovely art, a soundtrack worthy of separate purchase, and a “feels” story. It has some of the best collectibles and supporting material of any game I have played.  I would recommend this game to any fan of story games. Especially those of you that like to feel some emotion. Point and click gamers should be fine with it, but realize that there will be some action sequences that you may get a bit frustrated with if you don’t have OK reflexes, but I would still give it a chance because it is worth it.Included are 3 card drops. There are NO Steam Achievements in the game because...this is a uPlay game. It does have uPlay Achievements, but who cares about those. uPlay I had to go online just to paste the CD key in after I bought it, then I put it in offline mode immediately and never had to go back online. The game will start from your Steam Library, although it will launch uPlay before running the game every time. Since I already have about 5 uPlay games I have no issues with it. If you do then either buy it on a console, directly from uPlay, or don't buy it at all. Your loss. ;)"

,Recommended,260230,13823735,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,genkicoll,"The game is by Ubisoft, so you'll have to have a Uplay account in order to play the game.  A bit of a pain, but worth it if you love a good story!The screen resolution is adjustable anywhere from 640x480 through 1980x1020, and you can play Windowed if you wish.  We have separate sliders for sound effects, music, and brightness, and if you want subtitles, they are NOT the default.  Luckily you can adjust the settings at any time.  If you're using the keyboard you can rebind the keys to whatever you wish, but the controller buttons are not adjustable.  Speaking of which, we have full-controller support on this title.The game is rich in history, though dosed out in segments small enough to keep one from getting overwhelmed (or bored ^_~ ) if not a history buff.  These tidbits are easily accessible, and while it's not required reading, it surely enriches the story!  In addition to the facts that are unlocked as you play, there are 100 collectibles, and each has its own story to tell.  We also have a diary with separate entries, which I didn't realize until later on in the game.  The diary, like the hints, is accessible through the game menu (hit Esc.)Speaking of hints, there are multiple modes of play -- regular and veteran.  I believe you have to complete regular mode before you can access veteran mode, however.  Hints, if you wish to use them, are tiered, and give you a picture of one of the steps you'll need to take to progress in the game.We play as multiple characters, giving us varied views of the war and its toll.  These characters' stories are beautifully weaved together in a touching story.  The gameplay is a combination of point-and-click, puzzles, light platforming, and arcade-like action scenes.  Anyone looking for a thrilling ride, rife with action and glory might want to look elsewhere, as the compelling story is the driving force behind this game, and it's the story that will keep bringing you back to the game.The narrator will explain things as we transition, and his voice works beautifully with the story.  Our characters' voices, on the other hand, are intentionally garbled -- you don't actually need to understand what they're saying.  It may sound strange, but it really does work well.  Any person you see who has ' . . . ' over their heads means you need to ""talk"" to them.  You will see what they want or need via images in speech bubbles.  It's not terribly hard to figure out what you're supposed to be doing -- most of the time when I was stuck it was because I had missed seeing an exit or some such. :pI highly highly recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story, with one caveat:  Some of the action scenes need to have quick reactions, and I know that some of my friends have issues with this kind of thing.  Let me give you an example.  This will not be a spoiler as long as you don't watch the whole video -- Just watch the first ten seconds or so:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saKbYGB7JwAI had to redo the above-referenced kind of scene more than once, but that is not the part of the game I'm worried about.  There are sequences where you have to press buttons quickly in succession, switching around between buttons, and sometimes hitting more than one button at a time.  I don't know how well I would have done if I'd been on the keyboard instead of a controller!  I can't give you a visual of what I'm talking about without potentially spoiling some of the story, just be warned!I finished the game in somewhere between four and five hours -- not really certain since I got interrupted a few times.  Remember those collectibles I mentioned at the beginning of the review?  It turns out that you can replay any part of the game you wish in order to gather all of the collectibles!  Go to the Chapters & Collection section of the main menu, and you will be able to see how many items you gathered, and how many you missed for each section.  Personally I think it would be better to go back to get some of these rather than grab them as you play, as sometimes they're sitting out in the open during a time when you could easily get killed!  It interrupts the flow of the story a bit to stop and examine these things during the action sequences.Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a moving journey that kept me guessing 'til the end, and had me happily learning about the first World War (history is NOT my forte).  I really did love playing this game, and recommend checking it out if the above review appeals to you."
,Recommended,260230,18310245,"Posted: 3 October, 2015",all,Tom,"Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a puzzle adventure game, developed and published by Ubisoft, being released in 2014, on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One, and with a further port to Android and IOS. Valiant Hearts is also made by the same team that developed another original IP from Ubisoft, Child of Light.Gameplay wise, whilst this is a puzzle adventure game, there are no really generic puzzles, and they are only puzzles if you think about it specifically when you are playing. The game takes place during ""The Great War"", and you play the role of a couple of different characters throughout the story, an American soldier named Freddie, a Belgian Nurse named Anna, a Frenchman named Emile, and his German son-in-law, Karl. All four of these characters have their own story and all cross paths throughout the game.  At the core, the game is a side scrolling adventure game, as you have to either find certain items to progress, solve puzzles or defeat bosses. A lot of the game is also revolved around avoiding fire fights with enemies, so using bunkers and trenches to avoid fire is also something you should get used to.  Each of the characters also has their own special ability. Anna is able to heal patients via a quick time event; Freddie is able to cut through barbed wire, whilst Emile has a spade which allows him to dig tunnels in the ground to get around certain obstacles.The graphics in Valiant Hearts are very nice. Whilst they are not high quality ultra-realistic, they do present a nicely drawn out look to the game. These are some of the best 2D graphics I have seen in a game and they really fit the setting well.Valiant Hearts also has one of the most compelling and interesting stories to be seen in a very long time too. As you play as all four main characters, you learn about their history and how the war is affecting their lives, more than the expected misery. This game will pull on your heart strings and may even bring a tear to your eye at parts. You get attached to all of the characters instantly and will be immersed completely into its world.This is another game that has a major role in it for a narrator, and most of the story is told through his voice. The main characters in the game, whilst they do speak, they don't speak very much. The story is mostly told through their facial expressions and the narration. The rest of the sound effects are really good too, there are plenty of ambient sounds in each level to really draw you further into the immersion to make you feel like you are actually there in the trenches. A couple of the levels also have some classic musical sound tracks, such as the can-can when you are escaping Paris as Anna.Valiant Hearts is not a difficult game to complete; all of the puzzles are easy enough that you can work them out without much effort, but not so easy that you can breeze through without any thinking involved. Sometimes the most difficult aspect of the game can be when you are trying to maybe go a little bit too quick for yourself and end up running into bullets when you should really be taking it a little bit slower and hiding in cover. I think if the game had incorporated puzzles which were too difficult, that it may have ruined the immersion of the game if it forced you to look up guides to progress. The fact that even I (someone who is horrendous at puzzle games) was able to finish the game without a walkthrough just shows how easy the game can be.This games levels are so widely explorable, and there is so much to find and interact with too. You can get some form of dialog out of the majority of the other characters in game, but nothing more than maybe a few special grunts, or speech bubbles with pictures in, which maybe a clue of some form for your puzzle, or something completely unrelated. Each level also has a couple of hidden objects which you can set out to find, these bear no influence on the game play, and are merely there for the complentionists.Valiant Hearts is split into four chapters, and a full play through of all four chapters took me just under ten hours, for me that is the absolute perfect length for any story driven game, as it allows all of the loose ends to be tied up sufficiently and still leaves you wanting just that little bit more. There are achievements in the game, but are not linked to Steam since this uses uPlay, but you can go off hunting for them too. There is however no reason to play it through for a second time, the story is linear and will not change in anyway depending on how you play.I didn't have any technical problems whilst playing. The game has full controller support, but also works perfectly well with a keyboard and mouse. I personally went with the controller just for the ease of being able to sit back in my chair and enjoy the story. The game did not drop below 60 fps at any point and has a really nicely built in auto save feature too. Some people may be put off with the need for uPlay to play, however it's not exactly like its intrusive when you are playing, and it’s simply not a major problem; so please don't be put off by the DRM on the game.I loved this game, it was one of the few games I was able to get fully immersed into and played it from start to finish in one day - I just had to find out the ending of all the characters. I completely and utterly recommend Valiant Hearts to anyone; this is a must play game for me even if you aren't a fan of adventure puzzle games, you will still enjoy it immensely.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The graphic style is cartoony but the story and theme are deep and touching. The puzzles were great, gameplay was fun... and all the while, the story moved you. I don't even know how to really recommend this game other than: play it. It's an amazing experience.If you've played the game and you're here to read other people's thoughts, read on. Otherwise, be warned, there are **SPOILERS** from here on out.-REVIEW WITH SPOILERS-Valiant Hearts is now among my top games. I'm not going to say it's a perfect game: it's not. But for me it was an amazing experience.The graphics of the game might turn some people off... You know, the people who want realism all the time and want life-like HD textures. Well, VH is one of those games that prove realism isn't everything. I loved the art style of this game. It does what it needs to do: It's attractive, appealing, yet clear. It artistic enough to be pretty and illustrate what's going on but simple enough to keep the focus on the story.Same with the game play. It's not overly difficult but entertaining enough to keep you playing and interested; and simple enough to keep the focus on the story. Most puzzles in the game are fairly straight forward. Yet I still got that little feeling of accomplishment as I solved them and moved forward.The more action packed parts of the game also served their function well. There is obviously no emulating the feel of actually being in the battle field and having bombs raining down on you nor is that the game's purpose. It strives to ride that balance between showing the player a bit of chaos and still keeping it fun. For me, it achieved that balance. The digging part with Emile near the end is a great example. It was hectic with the cacophony of explosions in your ear, new bombs appearing out of no where, and realizing that you need to go as fast as you can or you're not going to make it. I failed a couple times... and that's when you have a little voice in the back of your mind saying, ""You get another chance but this kind of stuff really happened to real people and they only got one try. Failure was fatal."" Fatalities of war... so easily accepted by the ""higher powers"" yet so devastating on an individual level.The story of the game is really its best part. Each character shows the different kinds of people in the war: farmers and fathers who wanted nothing to do with the war; the nurses who had a never ending job to do; and the people with real anger in their hearts. The plot wasn't ground breaking. It had lots of cliches and was a little predictable but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing for me. I feel like these people's stories were meant to be a little more wide angled and ""general"" because that's who they represent... people like them in general. It's predictable and cliche to us precisely because the kind of stuff that's happened to them in the game have really happened in real life and we've already heard so much about it.I feel like the little touches the devs put in really helped this game feel like a piece of art. It was a very good decision on their part to have the player decide whether Emile kills that officer or not. Clearly, there was no real choice. We can all recognize that it would be wrong to send out a man into certain death for no reason like the officer did. The fact that you're the one pressing that button makes you feel complicit in Emile's action. I used to be against that kind of thinking for video games really... and I still am for the most part. If I have to kill some guy to progress in a game, I'm generally NOT going to feel bad about it. It's a GAME. But the fact that the situation they created here evoked a feeling of helplessness out of me speaks volumes. That's what art does; it evokes emotion.Don't even get me started on the end. You may or may not have noticed from the video but it is the player who has to walk Emile all the way out to the shooting post. YOU are the one marching Emile to his death and there's absolutely no choice about it. The decision has been made already by those in power. I tried to hide it in the video but I'll be honest here: I cried. It's why I didn't really give any good analysis in the credits. I was still trying to deal with the emotions. It wasn't sad just because Emile died. It was sad because it was so unfair. He didn't mean to kill the officer; he just wanted to stop another man from being killed. It was also doubly emotional because I pressed that button to make Emile do that. I didn't even need to see whether the game wouldn't let me progress without doing that. I knew what I had to do, and I did. I expected it only to knock him out but that's what Emile thought too. And so, Emile has to die.It was also an interesting contrast of endings. On one hand you're happy that Karl is reunited with his family... then they throw Emile's death at you. You watch the credits thinking it's over but then you see Freddy, clearly about to participate in further battles. There's no end to these war stories. They go on and on."

Situated in the First World War,Valiant Heartsis at heart a 2D side-scrolling adventure game with quite some puzzles added into the mix. While the gameplay itself is top-notch on its own (controlling the different characters is a breeze and solving the puzzles offers a decent but surely not too steep challenge), the true genius of the game lies in the way the story conveys all the emotions that can be linked to a catastrophic event such as the First World War.The story tells in a gripping way the effect of the ware on four characters: a French soldier Emile, a German soldier Karl (the son-in-law of Emile, which offers a lot of possibilities for the story-writers), an American volunteer Freddie who gets befriended with Emile and a Belgian nurse, Anna, who tries to help and comfort as many wounded a possible, without looking if they are friend or foe. The game surely is not ""heroic"" in any sense: it's not the (often false) heroism of the war that stands in the spotlight, but rather the life of different ""ordinary"" people who try to survive amidst the carnage. If there is one theme that stands out, it's that of human compassion even in such horrible circumstances: not only does the nurse tend to all soldiers she meets, the familial relationship between Emile and Karl puts the French-German conflict in a completely different light. The unexpected but true friendship between Emile and Freddie offers yet another layer of interaction. Furthermore, on several occasions there are situations in which soldiers of the different armies help each other out rather than blindly slaughtering their enemies. You even get a dog as a companion, who helps out on many occasions and is often the key to solving a puzzle.The story is told both during the actual gameplay and in different scenes between the chapters and portions of the game, and it turns out to be a true rollercoaster of emotions with a gripping, desolate end. It is rare for a game to move the player into tears, butValiant Heartsmanaged to do so on more than one occasion. I truly felt emotionally shattered once the game had ended. Ubisoft Montpellier also went to great pains to provide a lot of historical background on the First World War, and it manages to do so without giving the impression one is playing a mainly educational game. It was a very smart move to introduce ""collectibles"" throughout the game, which add a lot of information about daily life during the war and which can be picked up during actual gameplay. Together with the diaries of the protagonists and the historical facts which unlock when the game progresses, one gets a ton of interesting information.There really is no reason not to try and probably love this game. I know that it is a Ubisoft game and that it forces to use Uplay, but believe me: the quality, also from a technical point of view of this game is miles above the big budget games Ubisoft have released over the past years. The only downside is that there are no Steam achievements, which could have been a very fine addition - the Uplay achievements, though well done by themselves, are no match for the real stuff. Be sure to use a controller for this game; the controls are nigh-perfect and very intuitive.In every other department the game shines as well: graphically it does a very good job at conveying the often bleak atmosphere of the front - using a cartoonish comic-book style was a risk, but it pays off very well in the end.

You gonna play alot of different characters in the game but all of them are well connected with the main story. Basically the story is about Karl finding a way back to his family after he got separated and deported to serve the german army. To me the game tells and teach much more than that Valiant Hearts made me realize once more how important family  and true friends are. It also shows how  unnecessary war is you are just a fighting slave fighting for other people interests, killing people who never wanted any war, people like yourself, people you would probably consider as friendly or even your friend. Beside from that the game is a little history lesson you can find a lot of facts happend during the first world war. The gameplay is quit simple for a puzzle adventure game at the same time well conceived. It force you to think without being unfair or unnecessary hard. For myself I can say the gameplay was entertaining from beginning to end. Who ever was responsible for the design of the game made a great job the levels are lovely created. One more point I wanna mention is the wonderful music fits perfectly to the atmosphare. You gonna be golden with Valiant Hearts: The Great War™  if you looking for a game with a good story and fun gameplay."

It's story is placed in first world war, connecting the stories of German Karl, French Emile, Belgian Anna and American Freddie. The story is based on actual letters sent from the war to the peoples families.The visual style was the first thing that really cought my eye on early E3 trailer, had been waiting the game to release since. The music and sound also added to the great experience. Unfortunately the gameplay is bit lacking. Some action scenes and puzzles feel a bit repetitive, though it doesn't grow to be a big problem because of the games quite short lenght of 5-7 hours.Also there is a ""villain"" a German Baron whos character is bit too over the top and caricaturized. So it broke the atmosphere for me a bit. Otherwise the little moments of humour didn't bother me at all.Overall the game was great experience while played in short bursts. There is also lot to read about events, locations and items of the war for those who want to educate themselves a bit.Highly recommended for fans of great mature stories and/or  casual puzzles.[Score: 85]"

,Recommended,260230,16091993,"Posted: 30 May, 2015",all,Pointnclickster,"It seems only natural that since we are in the midst of the centennial anniversary of the war that was to end all wars, a game should be released. In the gaming world, it seems that almost every war has been covered. Sadly, little to no recognition has been given to the war that launched the world into the modern age and changed how we live today. Valiant Hearts proves to be one of the first games to give a great picture of the struggles of World War I as well as a satisfying gaming experience.In Valiant Hearts, we follow the stories of five heroes: Emile, a Frenchman; Hans, Emile's son-in-law who is deported from France because of his German origins; Freddie, an American who volunteers and fights alongside the French in his quest for revenge; Anna, a nurse searching for her father in Belgium; and Walt, a German first aid dog that comes across the path of each of these heroes and helps any way he can. While it may seem highly coincidential how these five individuals continually come across each other's paths, their backgrounds and motivations are very believable. The friendships that they build are genuine and felt by the players, without dialogue. Most conversations in this game are done by comic book bubbles and short distinct phrases that are spoken by the characters.The gameplay is fairly simplistic since it is a side scroller with puzzles and mini game scenarios spread throughout the game. These two aspects seem to be the only thing reminding the player that this is a game. These puzzles serve to help bring missions to successful conclusions and do not feel thrown in for the sake of having a puzzle.Throughout the entire game, there is a narrator that tells the story. The narrator serves to take the place of the spoken dialogue between characters and any reading. Having a matter-of-fact narrator makes the game feel like a documentary. As you play each scenario, there are pop ups that inform you about the historical events that inspired the in game events. The pop ups cover everything from battles to the affects the war had on civilian lives.   This is a great part of the game, making it entertaining and educational at the same time. Honestly, who really remembers being taught anything about The Great War in school?It is hard to criticize Valiant Hearts because of the emotional attachment that will develop. Unlike most war games in which the protagonist is the only competent character and can take on entire armies by themselves, our five protagonists are thrown into a conflict that is much bigger than them, and outside of their personal story arcs, they are just cogs in a giant machine. While they do a lot, they are shown to help other soldiers accomplish their duty, not do it for them. The protagonists go through being wounded, watching comrades die, suffering as POW's, and watching their hometowns be destroyed. There are also the subjects or desertion, mutiny, and treason. I have played games that have brought me to tears. This game was a sobering experience that was beyond tears.Technically, the game is put together very well. The look of Valiant Hearts is unique in that it looks like a comic book. While the look may seem somewhat childish, it does not change the fact that mature content is being dealt with. World War One contained some of the most brutal war conditions. The first gas attacks, trench warfare, and the controversial decisions that resulted in the unneccessary deaths of millions are all looked at in this game. The music is very appropriately used, from being contemplative, to exciting during a charge, to showcasing the popular classical music of the day during the mini game chase sequences.This game was entertaining, sobering, and educational. While there are other games being released that deal with The Great War, none of them approach it with the heart that this game does. Valiant Hearts is more than a game. It is an interactive memorial that brings to mind a conflict that changed the world yet today gets so little recognition. Valiant Hearts should not be missed by anyone."

It has all the ingredients for a serious tear-jerking story: the tragedy of war, friendship and family, characters you become connected to, hope, successes and failures, and a loyal dog. Expect to cry so much you become dehydrated and cause water damage to your carpet.If there's one flaw to this game, it's that it tries too hard to be a game, which can sometimes distract from the emotional moments. It's kind of hard to explain without demonstration, but rest assured it isn't nearly enough to ruin the experience. I do, however, for that very reason, think this story would be wonderful in book or movie form.Because of the nature of the story, I recommend playing it in as few sessions as possible. It's a six-hour game (I play games kind of slow, so I took 7), so you could feasibly complete it in two or three sittings. Or one if you have a Saturday to yourself."

,Recommended,260230,10818321,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,I AKU!,"I'll just keep this relatively brief, because there's a lot you can say to praise this game. Valiant Hearts is a fantastic game that treats WWI with intelligence, dignity, and care. The game does not flinch very far from the horrors of war. You'll be finding yourself dashing through trenches filling with mustard gas and avoiding German machine gun fire as people are cut down around you. But the game doesn’t just focus on the brutality but the humanity as well. It shows the innocent people caught in the crossfire and it makes its main cast quite likable and endearing. The game also does not take sides, showing that there was no good or evil side, just a whole bunch of normal people dragged into a situation they had no control over and forced to kill each other. It’s also very clear that the devs did their research and there’s a butt load of articles and entries detailing facts about the war.The game does have some tonal issues at times, the main villain kind of seems he would be more at home in something like Professor Layton or Henry Hatsworth than a game trying to be a mostly realistic take on WWI, especially because he's pretty starkly evil in a mostly morally gray game, but ultimately it’s not a major flaw.In the end, Valiant Hearts is a well-written and powerful game that will keep you invested until the end. This game is going to be on everybody’s GOTY lists, I guarantee. An absolute must play."

,Recommended,260230,15254553,"Posted: 7 April, 2015",all,Yureina,"Well... that was rough. x_xValiant Hearts is basically an adventure game-thing centered on a small cast of characters caught up in the First World War. An extremely rare setting for games since, more than most wars, ""The Great War"" was an abyss of futility and horror that should never have happened. The gameplay here is pretty much puzzle-solving and a few sequences which is rather reminicient of music rhythm games. The gameplay works, but that's not what you play this game for.No, what this game does, and does very well, is atmosphere and painting a picture of just what kind of war WW1 was. The game is chiefly focused on the French perspective of the war and the horrible price that was payed by France to ultimately win a pyrrhic victory. The game follows the course of history, and particularly upon the general attitudes about the conflict as it progressed.You start off in the optimistic summer of 1914 when it was believed this would be a short glorious war. But when plans for quick victory fall apart, the trenches are dug and the war descends into an abyss of horror. Most of the major battles on the Western Front during 1914-1917 are featured in this game: 1st Marne, 2nd Ypres, Verdun, The Somme, Vimy Ridge, before closing things with the Nivelle offensive at Chemin des Dames. This does make me a bit disappointed since they came pretty close to covering the entire war and ended up missing both its most horrific campaign (3rd Ypres/Passchendaele) and its most dramatic (Kaiserschlacht and 1918 in general).Despite that, the ending works just fine, though it is a downer. But by the time you are coming close to the ending having played this game for a few hours, you already know this won't have a happy ending. And it chooses it's conclusion to be the battle that broke the spirit of the French Army and led to widespread mutiny within it. And since this game is very French-centric, ending here is okay with me because although the French remained one of the great Allied powers for the rest of the war, it was the British, its Commonwealth allies, the Germans, and finally the Americans that took center-stage from this point onward in the west.WW1 is one of my most extensively studied periods of history, so I really appreciated the work that went into this game in keeping it close to the setting. Games set in this time period are so rare that any that do things reasonably well in regards to representing it accurately are liable to getting my wholehearted recommendation. Alas, I cannot do that here for one reason: Uplay. That is reason enough not to touch a game for alot of people and I don't blame them. But if you can get past that, then this is a pretty good game to pick up, especially for those with an interest in history and specifically WW1. :)Enjoy the abyss!"
,Recommended,260230,24415913,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,adam1224,"Valiant Hearts - runs well (even on Uplay, don't frown),  and offers surprising depth compared to most Ubi games, in the form of collectible items which unlocks  copious amounts of historical information. A good game - would require unique gameplay and controls to be great, but it's on a good way. Be wary - despite its serious content, don't expect much action and combat, because you will be gravely disappointed.Valiant Hearts is a game that's really hard to classify, and to review. It mixes animation fitting children's books with the horrors of war, simple controls, mild puzzles, and some quick time events while trying to hold up and carry a storyline with multiple protagonists. And not all of these are perfect.The animation is nice - the presentation is good, it's easy to distinguish certain parts of the gameplay area, and it becomes clear pretty soon that a game has a distinguished art style, which is always a good sign for a unique, good visual experience.The controls and puzzles work together nicely - the puzzle parts usually make good use of the game's control scheme, but after a while it gets stale. There is a limited version of puzzles you can create with (controller layout) A for grab and operate, RB/LB to send the dog for contextual places (ABXY), and one for throwing the item that you're holding. And that's it. The game has the potential to become extremely boring simply because the gameplay is a single-path sidescroller, and most of the action parts are as intense as getting past a strictly scripted guard.But the narration saves the day. Without the historical facts on each map, without the unlockable mementos of the era, the game would fall onto its own face. There are many letters, everyday items from the world of WW1 and the countryside, from the soldiers and their families that THAT'S the main reason in my opinion, that people consider this game as good as it is. These help people without the in-depth historical knowledge to appreciate more the simpler graphics, to imagine the mud of the trenches, the freezing cold nights and the problems with communicating with the loved ones. It's needed to make the cute-ish graphics into something that hints the reality of the past.Technically the game runs well, each episode has around 5 levels, each of them can be completed in maybe 30-45 minutes if really looking around, if needed to restart the level, it can be done in a few minutes - they are pretty short. If one dies ingame, respawns at last checkpoint, if the player exits, the whole level needs to be replayed.  In my playthrough, I've faced two  bugs that forced me to restart the respective levels, but as I said, it's minimal time loss. At least based on my experience, both the game and Uplay was trustworthy and hadn't caused problems besides this little hiccup.So, after all, I would recommend the game for everyone - at least to check it out because it's a really inclusive game, I think almost everyone could get into it because of it's simplistic control scheme.  But the gameplay is plain without the additional collectibles and the lack of challenge can make it hard to go on - in shorter bursts it's easily approachable for the lovers of more action-filled genres."

,Recommended,260230,14678210,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,it's💀shoepacabra,"Mechanically, Valiant Hearts has what it takes to be a fun, quirky puzzle/platformer/adventure hybrid. Instead, it takes on the First World War and all the associated brutality that came with it. And while it does a good job of driving home the differing perspectives, showing you the meaning of loss, and hammering you with the trauma of war, one can't help but wonder if the Great War was the right setting.Games tend to demand three things: 1) player agency, 2) the feeling of progress, and 3) the feeling that the world responds to your actions. World War 1 presented correctly could never do that. You grow attached to the characters because of their clear relatable goals, but a proper picture of the war would leave them wholly unable to act upon them. And by placing your characters in some of the rare pivotal moments of what was otherwise a four-year intractable meat-grinder of a conflict, it feels like individual moments of heroism can really save the day. It stands in jarring contrast to the reality of the war: a bureaucratic nightmare where political expedience and officers' incompetence fed young men into machine-gun fire by the hundreds of thousands.The game that was truly faithful to the war would kill everyone around you regardless of your actions. Your decisive push for new ground is turned back the following week. One day, your commanding officer gets it in his mind to secure glory by feeding as many of you into bloodbath of No-Man's-Land as possible. As you seek cover from machinegun fire, a howitzer shell bursts the thin strip of ground between you and a muddy crater and you drown in the blood, mud, and necrosis. Your commanding officer is later promoted for bravery. There is no rationality or narrative, just the slow drift of whole economies toward each other and a tectonic snap at the point of conflict. Valiant Hearts just barely scratches the surface of this.It's hard to imagine any game in the traditional sense being able to convey that. Valiant Hearts does the best job of it I've seen, but it's still much too far from the truth.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Valiant Hearts uses Uplay, Ubisoft's utterly needless third-party DRM and achievement/social system. It's less obtrusive than in some games but still ought to be removed.ENDING SPOILER:The last ""puzzle"" does attempt to drive home more of the senselessness of the war by having a commanding officer shove your squad through increasingly brutal segments of a French counterattack. I feel like the solution may be more effective on other players than it was for me. The growing sense of despair, confusion, and hopelessness that comes from your commanding officer demanding you push through a literally impassable section may drive players to the horrifying conclusion that they need to mutiny against their own officer as the only way to survive. There was no moment of dawning horror for me since offing him was my very first response to meeting an impassable puzzle. People with less wildly anti-authoritarian bents might get more out of it."

,Recommended,260230,10886837,"Posted: 27 June, 2014",all,Ooops,"Valiant Hearts is the latest game by Ubisoft, made using UbiArt, the engine that also powers recent Rayman titles or Child of Light. It's set during World War I (one), telling the tales of four characters: a French conscript farmer, a German expelled from France who then got enlisted into the German army [also, the son-in-law of the French conscript], an American who lost his bride during a German bombing in Paris, and a Belgian nurse. Oh, and a German rescue dog, as well.The most immediately striking feature of Valiant Hearts is the art: it looks like an animated Belgian/French-style comic. Of course, any game about trenches, piles of corpses and Mustard gas will look bleak, but the bleakness here is extremely beautiful. Watch the trailer, and you'll immediately see what I mean.The French narrator (who also voices the French version of Dumbledore) is excellent and, judging from the trailer, so does the English-speaking one. Other characters speak some kind of gibberish with a couple of recognizable words, and it works well. Overall, it's hard to not be extremely happy with the audio-visuals.It's clear that Ubisoft Montpellier had three aims with this title: to entertain, to tell an emotional story, and to teach about the ""Great War"". The result is inconsistent.Perhaps the biggest success lies in the ""teaching"". Thanks to its different environments and to the 3 years that the story spans, many aspects of the first world war are evoked. Those aspects are sometimes barely hinted at in the actual game, but the touch of a button brings small explanatory texts, all well written and illustrated with actual pictures of the war (taken from ""Apocalypse"", a highly successful French documentary series that used actual footage from the war, colored especially for it). At the end of the game, you'll have read a micro-encyclopaedia (or not, it's always optional). What's more, there are 100 collectible items scattered throughout the game. Finding one brings another small text related to that object, though those are focused on the mundane, daily lives of soldiers instead of the bigger themes from the encyclopedia. Sometimes, those get too mundane: I really don't need to know about all kinds of ID tags that were used by the belligerent armies. But most help ground the story into something I could relate to, because of human scale.The actual story is more of a mixed bag. For the biggest part, the heroes are alternatively living the life of ordinary soldiers (or nurses), and partaking in extraordinary, completely unrealistic adventures, the like of which would not have looked out of place in the pages of a pulp magazine. This tended to create an unfortunate distance between me and the characters. Fortunately, the last hour largely redeems whatever silly stuff I was subjected to: an especially gripping action sequence, very effective at conveying the horrors of big assaults between the trenches, is followed by an extremely emotional conclusion. Yes, I cried a little.Sadly, the actual game is lacking. It alternates between adventure, puzzle and action sequences, but stays average (at best) in all the genres. The adventure segments are especially disappointing. When they don't consist of boring fetch quests, they don't always make a lot of sense: your actions rarely have logical consequences, and you are left guessing at random. Thankfully, the adventure environments are so restricted that the guesswork never truly blocks your progress (that, and the built-in hint system). The rare puzzles lack variety. Only some action sequences are able to enthuse: You can't beat the driving levels, where the to-be-avoided obstacles arrive in rhythm with a French Cancan or with ""Night on Bald Mountain"".Overall, Valiant Hearts was a disappointment to me, because I was so in love with its trailer. I still admire the concept and the art is unarguably fantastic. I can forgive the uneven story thanks to the great finale. But when you strip the game to its core, you're left with decidedly uninspired mechanisms.It is unique, though. WWI is rarely explored by video games and war in general is rarely treated from this kind of perspective. Therefore, I would still cautiously recommend the experience, expecially given the soft price of entry."

,Recommended,260230,24949484,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,Idaho,"WARNING: Small spoilersAn incredible, charming, and unforgettable experience. Distinct from other games by its characters and their struggles, showing that not every one involved in war is just a generic soldier, and that everyone is a unique person with their own set of morals and history and their own way of life. A definate way its set apart from games like Wolfenstein and Call of Duty. Its a game about people, more loyal to eachother than their respective nations who struggle in a world covered in blood where the sound of clashing steel overtakes all.For those of you who dislike Ubisoft (I do too) i didn't even realize it was an Ubisoft game (I didn't realize U play is ubisofts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of steam) until I came to write this review. It is really not the type of crap (cough cough♥♥♥♥♥creed) Ubisoft normally puts out. Only downside is you have to go through Uplay to play the game.While it may be a war game its not action packed in the sense of running through the battlefields and shooting everyone you see, if you want that buy Verdun (WW1 shooter game available on steam) or Battlefield 1 when it comes out. The gameplay aspects of Valiant Hearts is that it is a puzzle game, of course with the World War 1 theme, which if your a history fan (like me) you'll enjoy quite it a bit more than say Portal 2. Instead of escaping a facility like Portal your turning switches and pushing minecarts around to turn off Mustard Gas switches so the soldiers can advance.In correlation to earlier where I said about the characters being people with their own morals, at one point you find an enemy soldier hanging by the ankle from a rope in an underground tunnel (he got caught in his own trap or was hanging something up and got himself instead). Instead of picking up his rifle on the floor next to Emile (one of the main four characters you play) and shooting the guy to leave his body hanging there, Emile cuts the rope and gets the German soldier back on his feet. While you may think its a poor decision the soldier then thanks Emile and you two go towards the German line, (something that would never happen in nearly all other games around) and once you get the the end of the tunnel you run into three armed German soldiers. They point their rifles at Emile (Him being French), and could either take him captive or shoot him dead on the spot, though the guy you just rescued convinces them to let you go. And they agree, showing you the way out.It also has many historical aspects, it has an amount of trinkets and other memerabilia you can collect each stage of the game, each has a description of what it is and its use and relevence. You can find dog tags, letters, helmets, gas masks, rations, medals, personal items, and other stuff. It also gives out loads of facts and information about all this stuff and World War One in general, making Valiant Hearts very educative. The characters are also put into historical events you probably didn't even know happened, like at one point your fixing then driving a taxi to bring soldiers to the front line. Wait. What? This made little sense when i was doing it though the game explains that during the Initial push to Paris the French government hired out a bunch of taxis to drive out soldiers from the city to the frontline to stop the Germans from taking it. I sure as hell didn't know that. It also features the old trapezoid models of tanks seen during the war, along with biplanes and older models of artillery. One of the main antagonists of the game is a german baron, who infamously has a pretty large and impressive Prussian zeppelin. It occasionally will show you a map as well of where each character is towards each stage of the game, showing the trench lines and fronts in the Western Theater.The game is also brilliantly atmosphere depending on how far you are in the game, there are four main stages that definately show this. Towards the start of the game you play as Emile, a french farmer turned soldier, and you go through basic training. During this you see all these soldiers in this bright, sunny, and colorful training area, flags and insignia are easy to spot and you get this proud, nationalistic sense of the area, that the French are confidant in victory. Shortly after that you are at a train station, soldiers about to be loaded onto the train, headed for war. The colors are bright, happy, and lively. Their uniforms are bright and clean, you can clearly see the blue shirts and red pants of the French Uniform. The soldiers are talking and their is even a little band there by the train, You get this overall feeling that the French are optimstic in the war, ready to see combat, and that they will kick the German army's♥♥♥♥♥all the way back to Berlin, That the war will be over in weeks with little loss or devastation.Later in the game its winter, and everyone feels it, though doesn't pause the war from it. The people and in general the entire stage is greyer, more war battered and combat experienced. You can tell that the Morale is lower, soldiers complain about not having shoes or socks and the bad meals, when they get food at all. You can still see that both sides are still willing to fight for victory. It gets far worse as mustard gas gets used.Towards the end of the game it is pure hell. The entire war is grey and blood stained. Both sides are so invested in victory after leaving millions dead the men rarely sleep as they are constantly fighting, and you can see the desperation in the officers and the rise of tension between the soldiers and command. Emile runs with a group of French soldiers, its obvious they have had their limit tested through war and suffering. They are grey, dirty, demoralized, injured, and covered in bandages. As you run with this group of frenchies you run into a French Officer, I felt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by this guy. All around him were these wounded, tired, dirty soldiers and this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is standing there, fit as a fiddle, wearing a clean uniform and looking like he just had a hot meal and a nap. He yells at the men you ran with to run into an onslaught of German machine gun fire. They are hesistant for a momment, but after more order yelling they run into the open area, only to be cut down in a swarm of flying lead. The officer, so desperate to get results, so out of touch with the soldiers and proper strategy, so wasteful of human life, so impatiant, using backwards♥♥♥♥♥tactics in modern warfare, gets the french soldiers killed. Its makes you upset inside. What happens next is pretty important so I won't spoil it here.There are a few minigames in it as well where at one point your amputating someones leg and if i recall giving cpr. There is also a part where you get a paper saying locations to destroy, and find yourself in front of a piece of artillery. Not gonna lie pretty fun shooting at things with it. Also has a fun though somewhat long minigame where you drive a taxi out of the way from bombs the previously mentioned Prussian Baron is dropping on you from his zeppelin, and you dodge various debris and garbadge in the road. The puzzles also are pretty interesting and complex yet simple enough that you don't need to look up a guide online.In conclusion Valiant Hearts: The Great War is an unforgettable and educative experience not matched by many if any games as narrative games go, a game about people and their struggles and history, national and personal. A game I highly recommend that shows the true horrors and struggles of Modern Warfare.10/10 would make german sausage again."

A lot of people seemed to dislike this game for the sometimes clumsy narrative (notably, the boss fights), the numerous clichés present in the game or the fact that it is ""unfinished"" (the story of George, the British, will be coming as a DLC). If I can stand those reasons, I can safely say they are missing out so much.Valiant Hearts is phenomenal, and as someone who knows the Great War very well, I can say Ubisoft Montpellier has done a monstruous work with their new baby. Many notable moments of the war are depicted in a very rightful way (the Marne, Ypres, Vauquois, Verdun, the Somme, Vimy or the Chemin des Dames) and the characters (Emile the French, Freddie the American, Anna the Belgian and Karl the German) are likeable and realistic. The gameplay follow as well with multiple types (minigames, QTEs, point & click) but never feels bland. Sure, this game can make the events a bit easy or naive (notably with clichés), but the Great War is a very complicated conflict and this game does a wonderful job simplifying it (even if it is only the Western Front!): also, I really liked the fact there are no ""bad guys"": you fight Germans as well as French as most people from both camps will try to stop you in your quest (war reasons...). Also, the folks at UbiArt (who already worked on the new Rayman games) did a superb job with their artstyle, cartoony but never childish. This is a different way of depicting the war far from all those FPS cliché styles, and it feels very fresh.But if I recommend Valiant Hearts, it is also for the awesome documentation that Ubisoft prepared with the folks that made Apocalypse (this spectacular series gets also a must-view mention from me btw); whether it is for the letters, the objects you get in the game or the simple documentation on the events, they do a great job explaining little details of this war.Valiant Hearts is a really good game, a bit expensive maybe, but it delivers very well, and even more. If you like everything around the Great War, wants to discover this conflict more or if, like me, your family has been involved in it, I would highly recommend giving it a try.Also: there is a dog in this game. And he does everything. Literally: EVERYTHING.Also: feels. A lot of them."

The driving parts although few and far between (and short lived) were by far my favourites. They were fun and brilliantly put together.I did encounter some bugs that stopped the progress of the game but considering how frequently the game saves for you its not an issue.What surprised me the most was the story and history lesson about one of the ugliest and costliest wars this world has seen. You do start to care for the characters and the game threw one or two curveballs I really was not expecting. Throughout the game you find trinkets and receive automatic journal entries that detail some information on the life of a soldier at that time, how they survived, the sordid conditions they had to endure etc.Its a quick game to work through and I have no regrets on picking it up."

Unlike Brothers A Tale of two Sons this game doesn’t marry the gameplay and story particularly well. There’s even sections of pure padding where you’re solving puzzles for no reason and with no payoff.Thematically it largely manages to pull off the WWI setting without disrespecting the dead. There’s a few sections where it feels like an adventure, like the kind the soldiers marching into WWI imagined they’d be having. I’m not entirely ok with these sections. It has a comic book villain, which I guess is appropriate since it looks like a comic book. But because it also tries to convey how horrible WWI was it feels out of place. I understand the need to not bum out the audience too much since it’s “entertainment”. But I personally would’ve preferred it to be darker and more authentic. Compared to WWII games though this is still way better.As a puzzle game Valiant Hearts isn’t great. Or even good. But thanks to the art direction, music and the attempt at a poignant story it’s worth playing. Some sections are brilliant, and the ending was particularly good. Too bad they had to pad it out with simplistic, repetitive puzzles."

If that doesn’t make it sound unique let me assure you that it is.  I am going to focus on the main aspects of this game to avoid spoilers so I will not be commenting on some of the specifics.  I picked VH up on one of the Steam sales for a few dollars.   This review relates to the PC version.  Screenshots by me unless otherwise noted.The GameThe Story – This is the big hero of the game. The story follows four individuals (and a dog) as their paths entwine from the beginning of WW1 to the end. The characters are an American soldier, a Belgium nurse, an older French father and his German son-in-law.  I won’t say what happens to them as I don’t want to spoil anything.   I will say that the stories are very well written and very moving.  The characters are voice-acted well and during the six hours of play you will get to know them well.   The actual game alternates between the characters as they go through the trials and tears of the war.How to Play – Most of VH is played as a side-scrolling puzzler.  Most challenges require you to find an item, use it in the right place and then move forward.  Some puzzles are the turn valves, pull levers style.  The majority of the puzzles are fairly simple but there is a hint system in case you get stuck.    In addition to the puzzles there are also action sequences.  Being set in WW1 most of these involve dodging artillery, sneaking past soldiers, throwing grenades or driving vehicles.  Again, most of these action sequences are quite forgiving so that they don’t spoil the story with needlessly atmosphere-breaking difficulty.   If you do get blown up by dynamite or captured by an enemy the game will rewind a few seconds so you never feel like you need to replay a long hard sequence and get that Groundhog Day treatment.The Art – The graphics in VH are comic-book style.  This is done very effectively with great animations.  Although the game is 2D, there will often be animations in the foreground or background to set the atmosphere.    The music is another hero of the game.  Some classical music is used to create pacing in the action sequences such as The Flight of the Bumblebee.  Other music is used in the puzzle scenes with great emotional impact sometimes.The Education – Throughout the game there are loads of historical facts you can ready about.  They explain how the war started, some of the battles that took place, the weapons used, and plenty of facts about casualties suffered.  There are also over 100 hidden collectibles to find. Each one has a blurb about its historical significance.  Furthermore, there are diaries of the main characters you can read although these are not historically based.How I played itIt is hard to say much about VH without giving anything away.  The impact VH had on me was that within 30 minutes of beginning I was emotionally involved and eager to continue playing.  I played the whole game within a week.  The story was tense and well-delivered with numerous cliff-hangers to keep you wanting to play more. Near the end of most sections I’d hit TAB and read about mustard gas, Russian dog tags or tunnel warfare.  I thoroughly enjoyed almost everything, particularly the puzzles involving the rescue dog, although the first aid sequences were probably the least enjoyable. The only other negative is that the controls seem a bit arbitrary at first, but within 15 minutes I had no issues doing what I wanted to do.SummaryValiant Hearts is an emotionally charged game where the story outshines the gameplay.   This should be a must play for most gamers.   9/10"

,Recommended,260230,21752469,"Posted: 10 March, 2016",all,Bahuemac,"A beautifully designed, highly polished and all-around impressive game of mild/average difficulty combining environment/physics puzzling with cutscene-ish time-based trials having you endure the hardships of World War 1 through the perspectives of characters of different sex, age, race and species (persons and a medical/rescue dog).The game has great art, great music, highly varied levels and gameplay executions (as much as is possible within this theatre of war anyway) and generally feels very thoughtful. There is a brief encyclopedia updating itself throughout the game giving info on the places you're finding yourself in and there are collectibles that are actually interesting to seek out because they relate to specific situations, behaviors or events of the time - for example bullet/artillery casings turned into other tools or decorative items by soldiers out of boredom, logistical necessity or in an attempt to keep the mind occupied when hunkered down in the trenches (I can't always be bothered with the brainless collectibles in other games; I might actually replay this one at some point just for those).The story has you switch between characters rather frequently, each having their own abilities of sorts and reasons to join the war (willingly or unwillingly) in some form or another until the individual lines of at least parts of them converge into one. This was done rather well, and has you wonder how everyone is holding up when not playing them, even though at times it can feel a little artifical how by the unlikeliest of circumstances and against all odds they still find each other again in a conflict as chaotic and brutal as this one consuming lives left and right regardless of ambitions and hopes.The story itself has some emotionally striking moments but otherwise left little impression to me. That's no real issue though since this game is more about the people and their imminent struggles within this time period which all works well enough as it happens. Even so I could've lived without the first half or so of the game having you chase down some evil German general criss-crossing Europe in his Zeppelin because that was just too much a cliché for my taste. There is a genius scientist of sorts too, fortunately not a mad one. If you can forgive these stereotypes you still have a beautifully designed and emotionally engaging experience that can be called bold for presenting things in such a rather unique, thoughtful manner and tackling a war that might be criminally underrepresented in games."

,Recommended,260230,13433981,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,laker,"Should you play this game? Well, it depends...From the game-mechanics point of view, it's not particularly appealing. Especially in the first few hours the game feels really dull because there aren't many game-mechanics to speak of. But as the game progresses it's getting better, even though the mechanics remain the same and there are only about five different things you can do, they are used in different circumstances and they bring a breath of fresh air into the game.You will do basic puzzles which aren't hard, but at least they make sense. There'll be stealth parts which are really basic and some driving instances which are really bad. The most interesting mechanics is that you can give orders to your dog, who can do stuff that you can't. The important thing is that even though the mechanics and little quests you have to do are not strong, they communicate a strong message (most of the time). It shows what was important for those unfortunate enough to be a part of the Great War.Some actions are there to represent the conditions of the soldiers, like digging through mud. This had a strong impact on me, because I've read all the little historical information offered by the game. The problem is that if people don't read them (and I bet there's a huge number of those who don't), the message will be lost to them. It would be much better if all the historical information was presented through the gameplay itself, or via the narrator, who did a really good job.The game caught my eye because of its art style and it was the main reason why I bought it in the first place. And although it's really nice in most cases, it brings the game down in some situations. The graphical fidelity of the art assets isn't particularly great and when the game zooms into an item, it looks bad. And I mean really bad - the game looks really unprofessional and feels really cheap in those moments. But most of the time the game does a great job of setting the mood with the colour pallet and all the assets.The story is about four more or less random people whose lives are closely tied together and you will play the roles of all four of them. The connections between them and their motives unfold as the story progresses and you'll grow to care for them.So, it's not the best ""gamy"" game but it brings about a really strong experience, if you can endure the first few hours (which you should). As for the price tag, I would buy it in a sale."

This alone should be enough to convince you to buy Valiant Hearts, but let's go on. :DAt first I was puzzled about what this game was about, since the marketing campaign of Valiant Hearts was handled poorly. In the end, Valiant Hearts is an adventure game with puzzle/action/stealth elements. The gameplay is pretty basic: the game is more about telling a story and making you learn something. Even though the gameplay is basic, it's still appealing and well-paced enough to keep you engaged until the end.The plot is about four characters (and a dog), which stories intertwine as the First World War rages on. It tells about their struggles, their motivations and their desperations. It's a grim tale where hope is the only element that makes men and women keep going on. You'll grow fond of the characters, and as you play you'll empathize with them. The presentation helps greatly in making you 'feel' the story and empathize with the characters: the artwork is phenomenal, the music is always spot on. Playing is truly a joy for the eyes and ears, the UbiArt Framework has delivered once again. The game is also full of information about the war. Reading such information is totally optional, but you should not skip it. :)My only gripe is that there is a story arc which could have been excluded from the game without consequences. It's not a meaningful story arc, actually it's detrimental to the whole plot (you'll see by yourself, no spoilers here).I hope this game and Child of Light performed well, so we can get more games like these from Ubisoft."
,Recommended,260230,10906902,"Posted: 28 June, 2014",all,(8th Lt. Col) IlluminatiRex,"World War One is a conflict that is severely underrepresented in all forms of media, but for videogames, it is in an interesting position. Many cry that it would be too difficult to make a game about World War One ‘not boring’, or ‘not too difficult’. Ubisoft announced Valiant Hearts: The Great War quite suddenly late last year. A new IP from a AAA Publisher and Developer is always news. Valiant Hearts is not only a new IP, but is a 2D Sidescrolling Puzzle game about World War One. Valiant Hearts is the answer to the cries of “Not too hard” and “Too Boring”, as it is neither of those things. It encompasses great art direction, style, music, story, and atmosphere. It is rare to see a new game like this from a AAA publisher, and I am quite shocked, and pleased.If you are buying from Steam, as with other Ubisoft titles, it does require Ubisoft’s U-Play DRM service. In addition, for some, the length may seem short (7-8 hours for my first playthrough). However, for its price of $15 USD, the length is just right. Ubisoft was smart in pricing Valiant Hearts.Valiant Hearts features four Protagonists, each with their own personalities and skills. Anna, Emile, Karl, and Freddie. Anna is a Belgian woman who was studying to become a Veterinarian in Paris before the war broke out. When the Taxi to the Marne began, she drove to the front and started helping the wounded soldiers of both sides. In game, Anna is able to heal wounded soldiers with a minigame that is reminiscent of Guitar Hero and Rock Band.Emile was conscripted into the French army at the start of the war. He fought at the Marne, and was wounded and captured by the Germans. As a POW he was made to be a cook, and Emile has the ability to dig in certain areas. When general Mobilization by the French started, Karl (Who is Emile’s Son In-Law) was deported from his home in St. Mihiel and sent back to Germany. There, he was made to join the German army. Karl also has a wife, and young son whom reside at St. Mihiel for the duration of the war. Freddie was an American living in Paris at the start of the war. Driven by a lust for revenge, he joined the French army. Freddie has a pair of Wire Cutters and is able to cut through barbed wire whenever he pleases. As well, his strength allows him to destroy any obstacles in his path in one hit. These four people are brought together by a German medical dog.The game is described as an interactive Comic-Book, and that is something I can certainly agree upon. Many sections of the game feature comic book panels showing something else going on as you are solving a puzzle or moving through the lines. The art itself, although it looks like it could be aimed at children, lends itself to a mature story about humanity and the true cost of war. It is a unique, fresh style that is surprising coming from a AAA publisher.However, in some cases the Comicbook style is a detractor. For the first 3 chapters, there is a comic book style villain, and he mainly pertains to Freddie. There is a boss battle within each of these chapters, and each of them feels forced. They are extremely out of place, in what is otherwise a poignant story that does not paint one side as the villain. However, the epilogue to that portion of the story is a fitting conclusion. As well, Anna’s healing rhythm minigame can get tedious quickly. Had it been used less, or in each case shorter overall it would have been better.In spite of those issues, Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a good game. It does not hold any punches in showing the senselessness and horror of the First World War. My favorite level is towards the end, at Chemin des Dames, during the Nivelle Offensive. With an officer to his back, threatening to shoot if he starts retreating, Emile is forced to charge forward and watch his fellow soldier be slaughtered. It is moments such as those that truly make Valiant Hearts a beautiful, poignant puzzle game.The Dog is also used as a good puzzle solving tool. He is able to go through spaces too small for the humans, and is able to retrieve objects for the characters, and is also capable of pulling levers. He helps tie the stories of Emile, Karl, Anna, and Freddie together well. He provides something that they can all communicate with, and loves them no matter who they fight for, or what their beliefs are. It is also an interesting addition to the game, due to the prevalence of dogs that were used for war purposes during World War One, one of the most famous being “Sergeant Stubby”, who was a member of the 102nd Infantry Regiment, 26th (Yankee) Division. Showing that the war effected not only humans, but our closest animal friends, helps show the destructive power of The First World War, and war in general.A detriment to some would be the historical accuracy in some places. Although the game is littered with facts (Hit tab in any mission, and historical facts relating to that mission will be shown. You can find a variety of objects in the game, and it will have a fact about that object, but more on that later). There are levers, anachronistic clothing, and objects abound (looking at that giant Chlorine Gas machine early on at Ypres), and to some that would be something to be put off by. Now, I am someone who is obsessed with World War One, and everything to do with it. However, in this case those sorts of things only enhanced my enjoyment of the game because it complements the comicbook style well, and helps keep the story and gameplay flowing at a good pace. An example of that would relate the story, as it would go nowhere if our protagonists were not allowed to freely move about the front.I am actually a fan of the charge sequences, in which your character is running to the right side of the screen, and you must dodge shells and machine gun fire. It helps break up the game some, and to keep you focused. In addition to those sections, I also enjoyed the vehicle sections. There are two types of those: Tank and Taxi. The Taxi sections have you driving towards the bottom of the screen automatically, and you must maneuver the car around obstacles and enemies. They also seem rhythmic as they are timed with the song that is playing. My favorite of those is when Anna is driving her Taxi away from Paris, to the “Can-Can” song. The Tank Sections have you moving left and right, firing at obstacles and enemies. These are also a nice change of pace, and keep things interesting.Something mentioned earlier was the objects that you can collect in the game. Some have noted that this seems out of place in a game like this, but personally I feel that the objects that you can find, and where you find them make sense. A lost Dogtag or Helmet dropped in the mud, a child’s gasmask in a cabinet in a bombed out building. When you pick up these objects you are treated to a factoid about them, and what ttheir context within the conflict was. It is an interesting way to shed some light on the war, and the objects that people used every day during the conflict.In the end, I really enjoyed my time with Valiant Hearts: The Great War. It is a remarkable game from a AAA publisher, and although it does have some minor issues, they are dwarfed by the good things about it. The “Come Back” trailer for the game said this: “Lives shattered, love lost. One day a farmer, the next a soldier. Sent far from home, torn from their loved ones. These unexpected heroes are swept away into the Great War that rages on, always hungry for more. War makes men mad, but Humanity can shine, even from the darkest of hours. And those Valiant Hearts stand up fighting for love, friendship, and honor. To the point of sacrificing everything, even their own life. Some made it, some did not. These are their stories”.  That is what the game is about, although names may fade, deeds and sacrifices never will. So those with Valiant Hearts, fear not, as your sacrifices are not forgotten."

I mainly bought this game because of the story and setting. I had read so many good reviews for this game and the fact that I am interested in both world wars. I got what I paid for and more. At first the story starts of a bit slow. Emile says goodbye and are drafted in the army. We dont know what Karl is doing for the moment and we meet Freddie at the train station. However the story picks up quickly and once it does you heart will be pumping. Now I am going to try and keep this short and not give away too many spoilers considering this game focuses a lot on story. The story is very similair to the classic war movies/series like Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers and Generation War. This game is not like the story of Call of Duty, Battlefield or Medal of Honor (Comparing to the topic here). In this game war is hell on earth, and there is nothing worse than war. Now that is what makes this game different from those games. You can also learn a lot from this game aswell. While playing the game you can pick up collectibles. each time you find a new collectible, you get a new entry in the journal, which describes the object and gives us information about it. each chapter and mission has it's own entry in the book and tells about the battles like, verdun, somme etc. During my history class I can tell you that I pretty much owned the test thanks to this game.Very simple puzzle based gameplayI had already seen gameplay of this game, so I already knew what to expect. To be honest I was surprised by it, and I had alot of fun. The gameplay is so simple but yet addicting somehow and the puzzles are simple but yet tricky in some parts. I think that the collectibles also has a very strong part in the gameplay considering I was looking for them throughout the whole game and it added alot more to the experience. Not much more to say other that it was fun and simple.Would buy againThis game lives up to it's reviews and more. Got a good grade on my history test and I enjoyed every second playing it. Worth the money."

Don't be fooled by the cartoony graphics, you're in for some heavy stuff. Consisting of four related emotional storylines, the game presents a horribly realistic outlook on wars and at the same time educates you about all the atrocities that happened during WW1 via collectible items and historical facts. The only drawback is the repetitive gameplay, but it's too short for it to really start bothering you."

And you should because the game's storytelling hits that right dose of minimalism infused with mellow narration that keeps you invested in Emile's, Karl's and others' stories throughout the game as they go through the horrors of war. In my opinion game gets better as it goes on relying less on direct narration and more on pure atmosphere and sparingly used set-pieces, especially in the last chapter.I guess in the end it depends heavily on your emotional investment in characters and their stories, but I would definitely recommend it if you're into story-driven games with some relatively basic gameplay."

The genre can most accurately be described as Adventure game with some light arcade elements, however the actions you will be performing range from ""Pipe Dream"" style puzzles to angle based tank artillery combat. The stoy keeps you interested and the characters are almost instantly lovable. Each ""Valiant Heart"" has their own speciality and personality which makes them all feel like people you'd like to see make it to the end of their Great War tale. Sadly, this won't be the case (as you know from the outset). Who will live and who will die provides drama, but the great music and haunting backgrounds do more than enough to create atmosphere without the fear of death.If you enjoy games about human strife and warfare without the need to constantly shoot someone, or if you just like a good adventure game with a fairly easy difficulty curve, you will love this game."

Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ brings you a classic deep and emotional drama that would make you shed tears without the use of romance.""Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ is a point and click game set during World War I.

You'll be able to see the Great War through Four perspectives. You'll encounter some puzzles as you progress through the story. The game is quite short with only 4 chapters but the plot itself is very much worth it. The story itself is the main selling point of this game. It also features some historical facts about the Great War and challenges the player to collect all historical items scattered throughout each chapter. The game's music and graphics are well-made.

The stalemates and trench warfare of World War 1 do not lend themselves to compelling game design however and as such has largely gone untouched. Ubisoft has stepped up and put together a creative game that not only recreates the events of mankind's first world war but has managed to do so with a bit of personality and even a touch of levity. The end result takes a bit of side scrolling, a dash of puzzle solving and a tablespoon of history and turns them into one of the most compelling games of the year.Diverging from action and focusing on the narrative and history of the first world war, Valiant Hearts follows the lives of Karl, Anna, Emile, and Freddie. Karl, a German immigrant living in France with his wife and child is deported in anticipation of war. Emile, Karl's father-in-law who is drafted into the French army. Anna, a Belgian veterinarian student in search of her scientist father taken captive by the German forces. Freddie, the volunteer American out to exact revenge on those responsible for the death of a loved one and lastly Walt, a doberman pincher canine companion who plays a key role in the lives of his human counterparts.Despite it's cartoon visuals, Valiant Hearts doesn't shy away from the cruel reality of war and puts you in the shoes of those affected by it. Whatever the reason the harsh truth is that War changes lives and the fight for survival is not only for ones self but friends, family, and country. It isn't always a dark experience, its visual charm and humor often gives it a soft hearted touch reminding you that even in war we can empathize with our foes in the darkest hours. The lives of our heroes repeatedly intertwine, along the journey, whether it's to support a fellow soldier in battle to aiding in an escape the journey is repeatedly done along side a partner developing them not just as individuals but as group. Each with their own goal but with a shared link.With each new chapter Valiant Heart lectures the audience by giving the player a bit of history via pictures and artifacts. They not only give insight on the history but inform the player of the roles and purposes of the items found and the evolution of the war tactics.As a sidescrolling adventure game Valiant Heart's gameplay is largely composed of puzzles. The controls are the same all around with certain characters having unique abilities. Some puzzles involve item gathering and swapping while other become a bit more elaborate without becoming too difficult. They often develop the character and never feel too tedious with a only few coming off as filler. There's enough variety to keep  the proceedings fresh with a few tasks becoming a bit of chore while other are too complex for their end result. One moment you're assaulting a strategic point and the next you're escaping a POW camp through stealth, it's a brilliant perspective not often explored by developers with the given context.Powered by the same engine that gave life to Rayman Origins, Legends and Child of Light we could only expect the best from the artist of Montpellier. The necessary amount of color, and grudge depict the world brilliantly. The multiple layers and comic book strips are not only aesthetic implementations but a gameplay accessory. Most of the in-game audio chatter is expressed though jibber jabber while the narrator does most of the telling. It's a perspective that gives insight between character shifts without being out of place. The soundtrack fits the era and immerses the players into the experience, an orchestral tone compose of wind instruments sets up the action intense moments, as the strings tag the tense heavy scenarios. Let's not forget to mention the enchanting piano pieces through out the emotional segments, all in all it's an exceptional soundtrack.Inspired by the letters of soldiers fighting along the western fronts Valiant Heart inspiration is given a the proper care. It may seem short and easy for the average and hardcore gamer but in the end the experience is well worth the asking price. Valiant Hearts is an educational for those not so keen on history and a delightful take on a subject that usually leans heavy on action. The characters are memorable, the art is beautiful, and the subject at hand is real. There is justice done for this horrific time in history and developer Ubisoft Montpellier implemented their style to create an experience that honors the Valiant Hearts of World War 1.Score: 8.5+ Amazing art direction and soundtrack+ Memorable cast of characters+ Variety in puzzles+ Fresh take on a game inspired by war+ History lesson for non-history gurus- Boss fights are underwhelming- Easy for the average gamer- Low replay value- Short length"

But that's not what this game is about anyway, so if you think you can overlook that, stick with me and keep reading.What really stands out, and I meanreallystands out in this game is the storytelling.Valiant Hearts follows four different personas with interwoven stories throughout the course of World War 1, ""The Great War"". You quickly become attached to the characters - a French farmer serving in the French army, his German son-in-law in the German military, a US soldier and a Belgian student serving as a medic - and feel involved in their and their families' fates, which lets you be a witness of the gruesome war in a way no documentary can convey.The game depicts the war in an authentic, accurate and thus very cruel way, not hesitating to show the suffering of women and children - war doesn't stop where the battlefield ends. Still, there are many moments of joy and humanity to be found within the tragic, war-torn story -it simply is an impressive, eye-opening and absolutely beautiful experience.If you enjoyed Telltale's The Walking Dead you'll most likely love this game - same goes if you're interested in history, of course.The game comes with 2D-optics, so there's not much to say about high fidelity graphics, but the game has a really nice art design. The drawn, sort of cute graphics stand in stark contrast to the the terrible, all to real horror that was World War 1, but somehow that doesn't hinder you from identifying with the characters of the game - quite the contrary, actually.When I finished the game, it seriously send a shiver down my spine.Valiant Hearts really shows the potential of the medium videogame.

The story centres around the interwoven destinies of five characters, inspired by actual letters in that war.Each character has their different motivations, and it is through their camaraderie that they can act upon them. Each story is compelling, and you'll definitely be whole-heartedly immersed.The art direction and animation style is probably what you'll find the most striking.The 2D comic-style art doesn't attempt to hide the gruesome and brutal truths from the Great War, which is very important. These are incredibly sombre themes they were trying to tackle, and the fact they didn't skirt around or trivialise the horrors, is admirable. Its not all horrible, however. There is some great humour in parts, which eases up the tension.When travelling through each area, which is usually a famous setting or turning-point in the war, you can bring up war facts about the area, the conditions the soldiers lived in, etc. In addition, each level has collectables to find, which sheds further light in retelling what life was like at those times. This experience wasn't only immersive, but also educational. I learned far more here than I probably would in a lecture environment. Maybe, in future, games like these can be used for more formal educational purposes.The orchestral soundtrack was perfectly fitting to each scenario.Haunting when trudging past piles of corpses, yet delightful when in a car chases (to the music of the can-can, to name one!).The puzzles themselves have a perfect difficulty curve as you progress. In no point did I get truly frustrated, yet you feel pretty clever when you get it right. The tasks range from going on scavenger hunts, trading with several people until you get what you need, to digging your way around trenches, to safe-cracking. Plenty of variety.Overall, this small-scale human perspective of the war is an excellent way of not only retelling an important time in history, but also producing a heartfelt story that resonates with you for a long time after completion.IGN Review"

Worth playing as a piece of art.However, I can't really call it a platformer game - it's indeed more of an interactive comic book. It has some puzzles (most of them are very easy, just require running from one end of the location to the other, bringing some item on the way) and very few arcade moments (like car chase). The game is quite short and easy - you can easily finish it in 2 days with no haste. It's also filled with educational material and the violence of war is shown in a subtle way (yet your comrades are often being killed in front of you, be aware) - so it might be a good game for older children.If you expect a challenging, fast-paced arcade game - don't buy it. You'll get bored.If you want to recreate a sad, but interesting story, packed with artistic value, then Valiant Hearts might be a good experience for you.Just a warning - Valiant Hearts is an Ubisoft game, so it requires installing and running Uplay (even when bought on Steam)."

Homage really.You play as multiple characters that are narratively connected but some of the time not directly involved in the war. The cartoonish style seems off putting for such a serious subject. However in practice the emotional attachment is that much more surprising and effective due to its first glance appearances.This is adventure/puzzle game first and foremost. You won't really be doing any shooting or combo breakers. Something I found rather immersive was the grabbing and then pushing, pulling or rotating things around. Levers, switches, boxes and carts etc. It felt like you were more responsible and had to take more deliberate action to complete the task. With that being said I had a real problem with the healing mini game that is mostly used in the Anna sections. Its a simple rhythm game with a bandage that will get progressively more or less bloody based on your performance. Its not a bad mini-game but compared to the to the other puzzles and deliberate action taking place. It just seemed like a placeholder. And as a result not nearly as satisfying to solve.Additionally, the game is well paced. From the somewhat leisurely if not extremely depressing POW camp sections, to saving people from mustard gas under fire to leading the charge into an impenetrable mounted gun on a hill.This was a pretty huge departure from the kind of games Ubisoft typically makes. And I believe it payed off.Turns out, as if you needed a reminder. War is not so great.Follow my curation for more"

,Recommended,260230,12034633,"Posted: 9 September, 2014",all,Little Puffski,"Truly great adventure and experience! This humble game came out of nowhere and has a lot of going on. Gameplay is varied and combines puzzle solving with rhytmic fast-paced sections, it even has some boss battles. While generally consistent, it always adds something fresh and new. But most importantly, the biggest drive of this game is the feeling, overall atmosphere and art style. There is always stuff happening in the backgrounds, graphically the game is simply gorgeous and the biggest thing is, that you feel like a soldier trying to survive in madness that war is. Sometimes you'll get to kill others, but most of the time you spend doing ordinary things that aren't boring in the slightest. For majority of developers, FPS is the first thing to come in mind when we talk about war in general, and shooting anything that moves and has a wrong color is a theme that overshadows anything else happening on battlefield. Here, it's the opposite. Battlefield is the theater, but you're not playing crazy gunman #315 that kills every nazi (most war FPS happen in WW2 anyways), you're playing as a group of different people, none of them being Rambo.Which takes me to the next point, characters. Are all great and likable, while being quite different. One of the driving things is also that the game is almost silent, there is very little dialogue, well, characters and NPCs say stuff, but it's quiet and unless you speak german, french and english at once, you won't understand these shouts anyways. The game can be very light hearted (it feels like an old fable, but it's not disrespectful, it's still has a very mature settings) but sometimes dives into downright silly situations with crazy inventions or invincible airships, which kind of takes you out of the otherwise naturalistic and brutal portrait the rest of the game is painting. Well, I guess they had to add at least some shooting stuff as a safe bet. It would be perfectly fine without it, but it's not like those sections are annoying or anything, they just feel out of place. Most of the time though, it's great. And the music is brilliant too - doesn't feel out of place, but doesn't feel too old or archaic as well.There are a lot of collectibles which I wasn't sure about at first, but after I've found out that it's basically building a little encyclopedy for you (everything you find adds a little bit of an interesting background information), I've collected pretty much everything, because I love games that educate you in an entertaining and noninvasive way. It's completely optional of course, but it's fun, brief and interesting, because first world war is generally overlooked, so many of us never learns much about it.As I've said before, game is quite varied, there are no two levels that would really look the same, content is a king. I beleive you can finish it in 6-7 hours, which can look short on paper, but because there is always something new going on, beleive me, it's more than enough. Story and game itself feel complete, it doesn't look like they had to cut something because of budget limitations like in other games (namely Kane and Lynch), you'll be enjoying every moment of this game and for that, six hours is just fine. Overall, the game only gets better towards the end, so you're left with satisfaction.There are few annoyances like the occasional moment in any adventure game, where you just aren't on the same wave as the designer and it isn't obvious to you what you're expected to do. Annoyingly enough, it usually happened to me when there was no hint available, so I guess I'm just an idiot. I was fighting my keyboard before I've just given up and plugged in gamepad, it's clear they haven't spend much time making the keyboard version, if you have gamepad, just don't bother with it. Some bugs here and there, and the difficulty of quick time events can get a bit annoying, but those are small issues, there is nothing that would prevent you from enjoying the game.Verdict:This game has personality. Gameplay is decent, but it's secondary to the overall experience you'll get. So if what you see doesn't touch you, don't buy it, because you'll probably won't enjoy it."

From Ypres to Vaquois to the horrendous Nivelle Offensive.  If you know your history--or are a WW1 nerd like me--then you can guess what happens action wise.The artstyle is great.  For how charming it is, the artstyle quickly delves into the dark, muddy hell that was trench warfare.  The main characters do not speak much, just one or two phrases in their languages...oh and a bark or two...but the atmosphere of the story, music, and even the artstyle is really something to digest.  From the beginning, it does look like it is going to be a light hearted...until the Battle of Marn where the bright colours of pre-war jubilee quickly turn into the grey, brown, and red hues of hell, with each extra ""cell"" (I guess we can call it that since it is a comic-book-style game) throwing in a great impact of emotion.Thank god for the three driving scenes, those were a needed--and really, REALLY fun--break.I almost cried at Vaquois, and I definitely stared blankly at the screen at the end.So, unfortunatel, you need uPlay, but unlike the other games that require uPlay to play that I have...I actually want to complete this game.Shame uBisoft can't make a game with this kind of story for their AAA titles.----Side note: this game is what BF1 won't be."

The game feels a bit long for what it is and some game mechanics eventually feel repetetive, but getting to play as each of the 4 main characters at various times helps break up some of the monotony.

The game starts off a little too easy, but by mid-game I felt responsibly challenged and never felt the puzzles were so impossible that no one could humanly figure it out and there were many puzzles where I felt competely awesome for doing it without any kind of help.Any cons? The game's story can be a tad silly at times. Also the character Freddie wants revenge against this baron guy (you learn that pretty early on so it's not really a spoiler), but they don't really explain what he did. Without going into detail you learn what happened (kinda), but not why. With Emile and Karl you always know what their motivation is, but Freddie I'm still wondering what was is in better detail the Baron von Dorf did and more to the point why.An additional con is like with other puzzle games I've played I'm not really motivated to replay them because you basically know everything. The fun is figuring them out so avoid watching lets plays or you've pretty much spoiled the puzzles and the story which is the entire reason for playing this game. If I replayed anything it was the awesome soundtrack which is for sale on iTunes. Annoyingly you have to buy the whole album instead of the one or two songs I actually wanted, but if you like the soundtrack it is available for purchase.Also they make you play one of those Guitar Hero style button timing minigames when you play as Anna the nurse. The last one is especially frustrating and I nearly put my fist through my computer. But despite that I would still recommend the game because the rest of it is fun.Still the game really feel atmospheric and it gets pretty grim towards the end. I feel like a play a slightly cartoonish version of All Quiet on the Western Front.Valiant Hearts is a game that never overstays its welcome. With very little dialogue you learn most of the characters motivations and their backstories. I liked the art style and had a lot of fun with the puzzles. I think it might be a little lacking on replay value once you understand the puzzles (especially the early ones). If you are on the fence maybe what for a Steam sale for ask for it as a gift. I don't regret buying Valiant Hearts and had a lot of fun playing it and I hoping to see more story driven World War I games as we celebrate the 100th Year Anniversary of the start of the war."

,Recommended,260230,19870689,"Posted: 23 December, 2015",all,Scroobz of Lampius,"Let’s state the most obvious flaw with Valiant Hearts prior to me actually talking about the game itself.This is a Ubisoft game. Meaning you are forced to use their 3rd party DRM, Uplay.Take that as you will, I just feel that it is important to mention when it comes matters such as this as many people deal with many issues in Uplay.Valiant Heartsis 2D puzzle game set in the first World War, following the story of several characters of which you get to play as Emile, Freddie, Karl, Anna, and a dog called Walt.The art style in Valiant Hearts is that of a comic book.In itself, this is no issue at all, it’s perfectly fine. However, graphically the game is unimpressive to say the least.Countless times I’ve witnessed the camera zooming-in slightly on a certain part of the scene, only to be distracted by the incredibly jaggy lines of objects or general area on the screen which I’ve stumbled upon.I understand that some would consider this a minor and petty complaint, but as I see it, it is still important to mention as it can completely pull you out of the game while trying to get immersed with the story telling the game tries to offer you.The puzzles are a weakness of Valiant Hearts. They’re no-brainers, yet at times illogical. They easily break the pacing of the game and disconnect you from its narrative.You follow our unlikely heroes’ unlikely story through unlikely puzzles.Most of the time the game is divided to the gameplay (mainly puzzle-solving) and the story. Both of which are the most important, main components of Valiant Hearts as an adventure-story-driven-puzzle game.Valiant Hearts is incapable of balancing these two pieces, and fails in combining them so they could add up to make this an enjoyable game.The story is emotional, tear-jerking, and as mentioned – unlikely. All which make it stronger together as a whole.It’s incredible to think that it’s based on a true story connected through letter from the War.The unlikelihood of the events of Valiant Hearts are what makes the art style fitting and not just a mean of presenting the irony and contrast in showing the grim, dark, horrific reality of war through a  softly painted world with the aesthetics of a children’s comic book.It’s also worth noting that throughout the game you are provided with little bits and pieces of information regarding the War. These are very much worth reading through. They are not given to you for nothing and they’re not forced as you can access them through the menu.All in all, in the end, after crying for a while, you don’t remember the puzzles. You’re only left with this one, final image from the last scene, and the beautiful, mesmerizing, heartbreaking soundtrack playing in the background.And that’s what makes this experience so goddamn worth it."

You play as one of 4 people, navigating your way through the trenches and towns in Western France and Southern Belgium, and some sections in Germany. It's a fun, puzzle filled adventure that never punches you in the gut emotionally. You feel prepared for it all. When all seems lost, you steel yourself for it and you believe you can handle it...but when you get to the end, you will find that such a tragedy has played out before you. All those hours of that wonderfully sad theme resonate inside you as you begin to feel yourself fall apart. I don't know how they did it, but the people who made this dark but hope-filled adventure will make you feel as though the losses were your own. Perhaps you would think it silly or ridiculous to shed a tear for a game, but I think you would be heartless not to. I cannot recommend this game enough. Perhaps there is something perverse about feeling grateful to have been brought to such an emotional point, to sit for an hour after the credits with head in hands and so many tears falling onto the table, letting that beautiful little theme play over and over and over again. In the end, we have all lost, just like so many millions lost in that horrid war. No, the grief can never be comparable to actual loss or those of the First World War. But, in the end, you will wipe away the tears, sit back, and let that lovely, somber little tune play as you reflect on those valiant hearts."

Those with a compelling and touching story are even rarer.'Valiant Hearts: The Great War' is a 2D puzzle adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montpellier. Set in France during WWI it tells the story of four characters (and a dog), a French, a German, an American, and a Belgian Nurse and how the war affects their lives, dependencies they build and friendships that are made in the process.From a gameplay point of view, Valiant Hearts is less of a game and more of an interactive animated movie/comic. Gameplay mechanics are restricted to solving a few easy puzzles in the form of tossing objects, pulling levers, issuing orders and executing QTE sequences. There are absolutely no hair-pulling moments or frustrating puzzles which is a positive because, in games belonging to the same genre, narrative often gets buried underneath tough gameplay and extremely difficult riddles.Art is one of the two areas (music being the other one) where this game truly shines. The art-style is, simply put, phenomenal. The story events are set in France and the areas include trenches, underground tunnels, field hospitals, prisoner of war camps, towns and farms.Now coming to the soundtrack.............it was brilliant! Easily the best in-game music I've listened to in some time. Really captures the mood and reminds you of war-themed movies like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.The game touches the themes of war including conscription, desertions and mutiny. The characters are very close to life and it's easy to empathize with their condition. The story is touching and, suffice to say, I almost shed a tear when it ended. Not to mention it was fun and very informative reading the diary and historical facts related to WWI that were included in-game.Valiant Hearts: The Great War is the best six bucks I've ever spent. Who says Ubisoft only makes rubbish games?"

However, I'd no idea that the very first dedicated title I'd receive to fill that desire was going to be Valiant Hearts. At first I was quite skeptical, it being a 2D side-scroller that lacked direct combat and all. But the trailers had me hooked none-the-less, and I was eager to throw down my pre-order the moment I was able.This game had me emotionally involved the moment it'd begun, it has a very, very good way of toying with your psyche. At first, you're all hyped, the game's atmosphere when Emile goes off to join the army makes you feel powerful and ready, and the game does a good job at using the characters and imagery to make you feel a sense of patriotism for France. But then, you actually get into the war, and gradually that hope begins to falter as you lose faith in the grand scheme of your nation's war-effort. Instead, you begin to focus solely on these characters who're doing their best to keep their lives together in this harsh time, hoping that only the best can happen to them in the end.Instead of direct front-line combat, the characters you play have more support roles. Game-play is present, and it takes place in the shape of various puzzles and stealth-scenes that require a healthy brain to surpass, rather than an itchy trigger finger. Boss fights are satisfying, just like most of the puzzles, and the game does a damn-good job of making sure that there's no needless fluff or filler to waste your time; everything you do feels like it's where it needs to be and is relevant. This game's story is a tear-jerker, even if some of the plot is easily able to be anticipated. Yet, the writers did a fantastic job at unfolding this tale, and I can honestly say that it has one of the best endings from both a literary, and emotional stand-point.In fact, it wasn't until the ending that I cried, and I'm not ashamed to admit that. It's not a story about martyrs, war-heroes, or soldiers, it's a story about people who just want to live their lives and be happy. As much as I want to write about the only ending in video game history that ever made me bawl like a ♥♥♥♥♥, I think it'd be better to just let people who've yet to experience this wonderful title to indulge in it themselves.

This game takes you on a journey of emotion among 5 friends, five comrades, five lost souls to the treachery of war. Emile, a Frenchmen, Freddy, an American fighting alongside the Entente, also Emiles best friend, Anna, the blue bird that saved them all on countless ocations, Karl, a French born man with German roots, that was conscripted to fight against his own family as a member of the German Empire, and of course, the beloved medical dog, Walt.

I have never, in my life played a game that has given me so much emotion, ever. The ending of this game made me cry for 3 reasons; 1: This wonderful game came to an end. 2: It made me realize how lucky we of this generation are to have had such brave souls, members of that ""Lost Generation"" fight for us back when they did. 3: The ending was just terribly sad, I literally cried.

,Recommended,260230,16260785,"Posted: 8 June, 2015",all,AHoopyFrood,"Can a video game be fun, emotional, and educational all at once? The short answer is 'of course' but it's a tough combination to pull off. Enter Valiant Hearts, a narrative-first, 2D puzzle game set in the oft overlooked First World War.Lets start with aspects that provide most of the ""fun"". The mechanics are a smooth blend of point and click style puzzles and physics or action based puzzling. There shouldn't be any puzzles that cause undue frustration and for the most part the solutions are fairly apparent for anyone who's been around the video game block once or twice. In other games the relatively low challenge level of the puzzles would probably be a detriment but, at least personally, in Valiant Hearts the puzzles were there to simply add contrast and tension to the story. There was even a small section in the final third of the game where the complexity of the puzzles started to draw too much attention away from the story, opening some chinks in the immersion.The hand-painted artwork is very well done, especially some of the character designs, but is easy to overlook because the setting doesn't allow for much color and variety. The animation style is simple but an effective use of parallax backgrounds give the scenes plenty of motion and depth. A simple but hauntingly beautiful soundtrack is used effectively and actually provides some needed levity during the driving sections.Unsurprisingly the emotional punch is brought mostly by the story. I say ""mostly"" because it was actually some background NPCs that delivered one of the bigger blows personally. With that said, the story is no lightweight, as is to be expected from a game dealing with the travesty that is The Great War. You play four, really five, characters whose personal stories weave back and forth in an implausible but satisfying manner. In fact that's probably a good way to describe the entire plot. While it's clear that the story is a work of fiction and contains some obvious embellishments, it manages to remain grounded through its presentation and focus on the personal side of war. The decision to not focus on nations and figure heads is terrific and gives the frantic and unexpected ending the gravity it deserves.Now to complete the tri-fecta we have the educational aspects. Despite loving pretty much all of the rest of the game this was probably my favorite part. In the U.S. at least, WWI is almost criminally overlooked in most educational curriculums, probably due to our late entry to the war and no fighting happening on our soil, so the chance to learn more in a game setting was exciting. Valiant Hearts accomplishes this in a couple of ways. First off they use real places, real battles, and an accurate depiction of the players involved (it likely would never have occurred to me that the Canadians were heavily involved let alone how instrumental they were at times). For me though the more intriguing tidbits came from the short historical background info, complete with real photos, provided in each level and the collectible system. Scattered through each level are a number of items relevant to the level and war in general. When you find an item you can open a page that provides a little insight to the nature of the item and life during WWI in general. The combination of dramatized but immersive story and real life accounts allows for greater impact than either could provide alone and there in lies the beauty of using games for education. I really hope that the developers can find a way to give some other overlooked conflicts the Valiant Hearts treatment.As promised, that's fun, emotion, and education in one game shaped package. Usually when making recommendations there are caveats like, ""probably best for fans of genre X"" or ""Feel free to pass this up if you don't enjoy Y"" but Valiant Hearts has no such caveats. I really feel that there is something here for everyone. Even if you know all the WWI facts already or don't typically enjoy puzzle games (there is a hint system for you folks by the way), simply being reminded that wars are fought by humans, on both sides, is something we all could benefit from."

That said though, most of Valiant Hearts was a great experience, and almost alone amongst video games, portrayed war in a humanist manner. The puzzles and exploration of this point-and-click game is focused far more on surviving the fields, trenches, prisoner camps, and occupied towns of the Western Front of World War I, than on actually fighting the war itself.This is also very much a character driven event, with a cast of fairly interesting and sympathetic characters for protagonists, representing several different nationalities from both sides of the war. I would say that the game succeeds at neither making heroes or villians out of either the Allied or Central Powers, but this attempt is undermined by a somewhat out of place and ridiculous sub-plot about a cartoon-ish evil German Baron some of the protagonists are chasing down for several reasons. Luckily it isn't the main focus of Valiant Hearts, but this story ultimately ends rather suddenly and bizarrely and serves almost no purpose other than to give a reason for the characters to move from location to the next.The better moments of the game are the first half hour or so (as the blissful civilian life for one character is tranformed by the war's beginning) and the surprisingly emotionally end, though there are highlights scattered throughout. Overall Valiant Hearts is a mixed bag, and while I've mentioned a lot of things it doesn't do well, there's a real emotional core to this experience that made it worthwhile to me. Hopefully Valiant Hearts is successful enough to become a series, with future games that continue to maturely tell stories of living through a war, not just fighting it. Hopefully this series also does a better job with consistency in tone and having some greatly improved player agency and gameplay. That said, I still recommend Valiant Hearts if you are a history buff, enjoy character driven stories, or if anything else about this unique project seems interesting."

Valiant Hearts brings the other side of wars (in this case, World War I), so instead of killing enemies to win the game (SPOILER ALERT:although at nearly the end of the game you areforcedto kill someone), you will solve puzzles (and collect items, which is completely optional but required towards 100% completion of the gam... ahem... achievements). There are only four characters, and most of the time you will control only one of them. Don't get disheartened; a canine friend will help during the quest of war (and sometimes your cooperation will be required to continue). This game needs only less than 10 hours to complete, and if you are stuck on a particular puzzle, wait until the game gives you hints (or pay attention to your canine friend, mostly he will bark to item of interest). Great story, the last minutes are pretty tense, and the ending is quite emotional; be warned. Assassin's Creed players will be familiar of the Animus Database; this game also offers similar journal, or real-world facts about WW I, and you can fire up the browser to find more information. What a fun way to learn history!In short, this game is for you who love historical events and to show that wars offer us no good.Some may be concerned about Uplay (and its frequent updating), but don't let it discourage you from buying and playing this game. If you can install Steam to manage your games, then Uplay is not a big deal.Oh, and for some players, this game might be punishing. One hit of a bullet is a one hit kill. Explosions will kill instantly if you are within range. Gases will also kill. So enjoy your timing to avoid them at all costs :)"

This game, It is beyond phenomenal, never has a game ever made me cry until I played this, I am quite a History lover and I love to see how we as a race evovled and learned from our past, this game looks back at one of the most devestating conflicts known to man, The Great War. This is no run and shooter or anything like that, it is a beautifully story driven puzzle game. The puzzles are fun and it is also fun finding the collectables. There is so much history which by my standards is pretty accurate(NOT INCLUDING THE ACTUAL GAME I MEAN THE LITTLE HISTORY NOTES YOU CAN READ ABOUT THE WAR). This game was such a breath of fresh air, I am a lover of immersive tactical first person shooters, but no game comes closer to being as immersive as this. This game perfectly captures the horrors of war and what humanity does to each other, this isn't just a shooter where you mindlessly KILL KILL KILL not thinking about the lives of whoever you just murdered. You get to experience the lives of broken souls seperated from each other in the dark times of war. We see how people become from simple farmers to a hero. This game makes you think, war is an aweful thing, just plain aweful and when I say that I mean literally it will be shoving your face with horror after horror after horror. This truly tells us that the world is no happy place, our home has been scared by its own inhabitants for centuries, she has seen death to many times to count. This game is what I call the perfect masterpiece, there is not a single flaw in this game, well worth 15$ for me to cry in the end. When you go to play this remember, your not only in for a really good puzzle game, your in for a lesson, a lesson about humanity and how we continue to mindlessly destroy each other but with this lesson comes knowlegde, that boring history class that you always hated in middle school wasn't only teaching you the history, they were giving a life lesson so then when the time comes we are ready to our worlds next leaders, and that when we look back at things like this we know that war should never be the answer because then the people must suffer, they must have their families seperated, and murderd and lost. This game doesn't look for your action-packed heartracing side of war, this goes for the heart-wrenching, terrifying side of war. I would recommend this game to anyone truly a 10/10 game..."
,Recommended,260230,13669028,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,Evilgaze,"SUMMARY: For those who don't want to read more, Valiant Hearts is simply an awesome as well as moving game and I highly recommend it; you won't regret picking it up.As someone who has been fortunate enough to live in a peaceful country, war is something that, thankfully, I've never personally experienced.  As a result, it's hard for me to truly understand the terror and horror of what being in a war actually is.  I've seen the awful photos and videos but that's not like actually being there, fighting for your life or just trying to survive.  That's why I appreciate games like Valiant Hearts that puts a real and human perspective on war and shows just how terrible both sides can be sometimes.Valiant Hearts is an adventure / puzzle game set in Western Europe during World War I.  You play as one of four regular people (or their dog companion) who didn't want war and are simply doing their best to survive it.  The gameplay involves solving 2D puzzles (e.g. collecting required parts, flipping switches, etc.) as well as timing your movement to avoid enemy obstacles and hazards; it's not too difficult in general, even though there can be some challenging parts.There's also an educational component to it; the developers of the game partnered up with a group of WWI historians to ensure that the game is as historical accurate as possible.  As a result, there is information on each the big battles and events that occured during the war; in addition, every level has historical objects that the player can collect, each of which has their own descriptions.  While not required, reading this material adds more immersion and ultimately understand of what life what like during that time.The graphics are great and the art style is truly unique; all of the graphics are hand-drawn and are unlike any other game I've seen.  There is an incredible attention to detail; obviously, a lot of care and effort went into making the world feel alive.  The backgrounds are frequently dynamic, highlighting that you're just in some small part of the war and that there's action going on elsewhere.The music and sound effects in the game are amazing and add further immersion to the game.  They actually use songs and anthems that are appropriate to that time period and place; it made me feel like I had been transported back to time.  It really is a beautiful soundtrack and one that I actually purchased because of how nice it was/While the rest of the game is great, the real appeal of Valiant Hearts is its atmosphere and story; it shows regular people, not super soldiers, who have to deal with the brutality of war.  It makes you invested in these characters and you end up finding that you really do care about them and want them to live through it.  It shows the human side of war and how not everything is black and white.  I'm not going to spoil anything here but I actually did tear up a bit at the end; I'm sure I'm not the only one who did.So to make a long story short, Valiant Hearts is an amazing game that I highly recommend that you experience for yourself."

The game manages to teach us a lot about WWI (really, there is an exceptional historical accuracy, main facts about the war are covered and you get to play on some historic events), while also achieving quite a lot on other areas. The music is exceptional, the art is beautiful, the history it's touching. Only cons: Sometimes it's a bit infantilized for my taste, but that's because they probably created it in a way to reach the young persons, too. Overall, is one of those you should not miss."

I haven't had issues with Uplay and after beating this game I don't have a need for it again. That aside, let's look at the game.First up is the most glaringly obvious, this game is not the standard Ubisoft triple A title. The graphics are 2d and it is a linear sidescroller. However, if you love this kind of beautiful art like I do or just can handle a game that doesn't have ultra realistic faces then you'll love it. Graphics : 10/10Secondly we'll get to gameplay! The gameplay is superb and even a bit challenging. There is a great collection of puzzles to solve, fun segments of action, and even a little rhythm based mini game. Everything is done well and I haven't seen a single guffaw. Not a 10 simply because there are a puzzle or two that are a bit obtuse so you need to wait for a hint, which drop after a timer reaches zero whilst solving a puzzle. Gameplay 9/10the music is great. The classical music is wonderful and fitting in the car chase segments while the action segments are accompanied by a wonderful few tracks. The ONLY issue I found is that the piano segment, although beautiful and wonderful, doesn't have an alternative piano track for the sad segments. Not much an issue, but preventing a perfect score for me. Music: 9/10Finally, the story. It begins a bit cliched, but interesting. It follows 4 people, a German born Frenchman who is deported back to Germany and forced into the army, his father in law who is drafted back into the French military, an American man who joined the French military after a personal trajedy (no spoilers), and a medic from Belguim trying to find her lost father. 5 if you count the wonderful medical German Shepard that joins the team. These stories weave together perfectly as they track down the elusive Baron and then deal with the aftermath and the horrors of war. As you progress the story gets darker and darker, almost mocking the lighthearted art style. The last couple scenes hit hard, and the ending will make even the strongest man cry provided he has a heart. The characters don't even speak and I felt more connected to them than most games I've played in the last year. What starts as a cliche weaves together to form one of the best stories I've seen in a game in a long time. Story: 10/10To recapGraphics: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10Music: 9/10Story: 10/10This is a clear cut winner, buy it even with Uplay. It's well worth it."

Interspersed in it are driving sessions and a rythm-based minigame for the nurse character. It is set in the first three years of the first world war and covers the story of several characters of different origin and situation and does a real good work of what in a fully fictional story would be called world building, but in this game is history education.The game has really good music, voice acting and audio design in general, and the aesthetic of the game is based in a comic book/animation style that really hits the mark for telling this kind of story that is in essence rather grim. And make no mistake, it is a really grim setting. The story of this game has it's ups and downs, but it is in content really a message of how bad life during and in the middle of war can get.The puzzles are easy to medium difficult I would say (there is a hint system if you find yourself having trouble with any of them), the driving sessions and the rythm games are nice break ups from the puzzling, and there are a few boss battles as well.However, the story is this game is it's strong point. It is a really strong story, with characters whose motivations, dedication and emotions are well fleshed out and make you really empathise with them and the decisions and consequent actions they are forced into."

,Recommended,260230,20638309,"Posted: 20 January, 2016",all,Bro,"Valiant Hearts is an emotional, well crafted puzzler adventure game set in World War 1. There are point and click puzzles, dodging games, a rhythm game while doing first aid, puzzles involving swapping between your character and your dog (who can fit in fox holes, distract soldiers, fetch items and pull levers), and actual historical facts mixed into a solid plot. You play as four different people and a war dog. You'll be digging trenches, ducking mortars, escaping from behind enemy lines, impersonating officers, blowing up a zepplin, pulling wounded men from piles of bodies just to see them shot down, and taking cover from machine gun nests behind those same piles of bodies. Despite the stylized cartoon art, the game manages to connect on an emotional level, at least it did for me.The simple mechanics are used in interesting ways. In my favorite segment you are driving an escape car and must dodge mortar fire, TNT barrels, road blocks, strafing machine guns, grenades and ramming attacks by the giant tank chasing you long enough that its driver gets impatient and opens the hatch to throw nades (leaving it open for YOU to throw a grenade into the tank). AND you do all this synchronized to beautiful classical music! (Flight of the Bumble Bee.) The music in this game is wonderful.The main downside is UPlay, but it didn't get in my way much. Opening in Steam directly opened the game and UPlay was minimized.There is genuine emotion in this game, you can tell the developers cared and treated World War 1 with as much respect as they could in a video game about it. They included artifacts with detailed descriptions for you to find, letters from soldiers you may read, they based levels on actual events in the Great War, and short factual write ups on aspects of the war for each level. One of those write ups includes the fact that chlorine gas bombs killed men by burning when exposed to water, so the insides of unprotected soldier's lungs burned and blistered until they died in agony, and one of the remedies the men came up with was breathing through urine soaked rags. Horrible stuff but this developer didn't shy from it, war is hell.It's a perfect game for history buffs, indie and adventure gamers, and people who love dogs. It has some moderate challenge, but isn't a hardcore type of game, I finished it in 6 hours and my reflexes aren't great.8/10"

I’m not a big fan of the genre, but the game’s setting and appealing art style was enough to draw me in. The game did a good job of creating a compelling story that didn’t feel constrained or restricted by the overall historical accuracy of following World War 1. Also, attaching interesting historical facts and information to the game’s collectibles was a smart way of adding extra content into the game worth finding, rewarding you with context and backdrops for the levels you were playing through. Even though the game’s story was pretty whimsical at times, the serious undertone of what was going on and constant clash between the playful art style and the horrors of war definitely made playing this game a captivating experience. I would reccommend this game to those who enjoy a good story, engaging but lighthearted puzzles, and are generally interested in learning more about World War 1."

This piece of art goes far beyond the concept war games usually has. For example, most war games involves you shooting the living hell on everything to solve an issue. But in Valiant Hearts, however, you rarely shoot a gun and merely do simple yet creative puzzles to overcome a problem. Valiant Hearts mainly focuses on the effects the Great War had on the people rather than the fighting men out on the fronts and that's what you usually don't see in usual war games. Gameplay is fantastic, a gorgeous art style, a bit of humor every once and again and just a compelling story. 10/10"

,Recommended,260230,13741131,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,Treefolk,"Basicamente, Valiant Hearts é um jogo em 2D recheado de puzzles e possui uma narrativa baseada em acontecimentos da Primeira Guerra Mundial desde o assassinato do arquiduque Francisco Ferdinando (nos livros de história marcado como o marco inicial  da WW1) até os ultimos anos da guerra em 1917 e 1918. O game conta a história de uma família rural, de Saint Mihiel na franca, em que um dos membros (Karl) por sua descendencia alema, é chamado para o exército alemao e é obrigado a deixar sua familia. Paralelamente, o pai da esposa de Karl (Emile), personagem principal do game, recebe uma carta sendo convocado para o exercito Frances e é obrigado a deixar somente sua filha e seu neto Victor. O gameplay do jogo nao é focado em matar os soldados para progredir, mas sim utilizar de poucas cenas de ação combinadas com puzzles mto bem pensados e divertidos de serem realizados, fazendo uma das mais brilhantes aventuras que vivenciei em um game até hoje. Valiant Hearts nao é só mais um jogo baseado em guerras, mas sim uma história, assim como um livro, um filme, capaz de passar emoção e um vinculo de proximidade com os personagens, recomendo esse game nao só para aqueles que curtem uma jogatina, que queiram conhecer uma história fantástica juntamente com uma lição de vida, mas tambem para aqueles que acham que video game nao trazem benefícios e servem apenas para divertimento, pois um game bem feito é muito mais do que isso, é uma história pra vida inteira e Valiant Hearts é um belo exemplo disso."

I stopped and looked around the beautifully crafted scenery more than once and just stood there, taking it all in - presentation and story.The presentation is one of a kind. Music, Sound and astethic all blend into one big awesome something, that just works all the way to the end. Nothing to complain here.The gameplay is quite simple most of the times and it seems it is more of a means to deliver the narrative anyways - and that folks, works just fine.There is a lot to see and experience storywise. War is depicted from a different angle, which we only rarely see in games (Spec Ops as one good example). Valiant Hearts focusses on helping people and especially touches the topic of friends in war. People you meet, at times only briefly, feel closer to you, than your family at times - at least this is what I felt during my time playing. Brief and simple encounters made me stop and think - which is a good thing.War is told not only through the direct atmosphere and presentation of the story though. Even stuff like the choice to go for a 2D-Setting - having a focus on limited movement and ultimately no choice but to move from one side of the screen to the other, might carry a message as well. This message -LIGHT SPOILER ALERT- climaxes in the finale, where moving left is no longer an option. Realizing this while playing made me feel weird. Wanting to go back just one step for a personal reason, but not being able to do it. - SPOILER ENDING -Anyway - Valiant Hearts is a nice example of interesting storytelling and a lot of additional stuff to find and experience, if you are willing to look and listen closely.uPlay is a disgrace though."

From the start off, I was hooked, the simplicity of the gameplay, not to mention the loveable and  well constructed characters, with a backplot not over-emphasized but yet provides enough information so that you can relate to them each in a different way, from the tough Freddie, to a father's love of his family (Emile), enough to go to war, to a german's complicated existence (Karl), and a young woman's heartfelt (Marie), yet innocent journey to find her father, this experience of the great war is one that I will not forget. The feel of each level is clear, emotions are high when going through this, i'm not one to cry, but this had made me reflect on the life the world has today, and the frailty of human life, why wars happen again and again, and the effect it has on each of us as individuals and human beings. I have nothing to recommend further, than this game is  a pure, honest and heartfelt account of various persons, going through their own hardships and tribulations, with the most violent and reflective backdrop. There is no need for action, the game itself is a work of art, and a masterpiece of the difficulty of the first world war. A game that focusses more on the real life emotives of humans, how events can change us, rather than a game of pure enjoyment. If you are willing to invest a relatively small amount of time, I heavily suggest you give this great title a try, and being the 101st anniversary of the great war coming up, there's no better reason to reflect on what many of us take for granted today, and how easily things can change, and change each of us.....10/10, an experience i've never had."

I wasn't expecting such an incredible story and adventure!The game is a side-scrolling, platform puzzle game with views into WW 1 through the lives of 4 characters you play in the game.  And when I mean ""views"" -- literally!  At the start of many levels there is a ""Facts"" page that can come up where it shows you ala a press photo or something and a paragraph of what's going on in WW1 at the stage of the game you're playing.  So while you're playing a game, it gives you the background of what's going on.  Also there are a number of hidden items that you can collect on each mission (over 100 in all) that then shows you a blurb about that item from that period in history.  It really sets the stage and atmosphere for the game.The Good:+ Story.I wasn't expecting such an engaging story from this!+ Multiple playable charactersfor different viewpoints of the story.  You play the game as four different people, not counting the helpful dog that you run across who assists your characters and you can give him commands too.+ Good length.It took me 8 hrs to complete the campaign (with just some of that time looking for the hidden items :-) )+ Graphics and Animation.I just love that ""moving pencil sketch"" look in the game, and they all move smoothly and comically.+ Voices and Sounds.Fabulous.  The game is NOT narrated with speaking playable characters, but they do have voices.  The voices just give a hint of what they're saying, in the accent of the character, and adds to the charm.  The narrators they do have in between missions are great.+ Pop up story boxes.The NPCs in the game that you meet communicate with unintelligible words, but it is made clear through pop up boxes or icons in speech balloons.  It's done very well, and conveys the meaning perfectly.  Great.+ Many hidden items.Each mission there can be 3 to 8 items that you can find in out of the way, hidden spots.  And each gives you a little paragraph of history.  Loved it.+ Good puzzleswithout being too easy/tough.  And if you do get stuck, they have a nice Hint system.The Bad, or just OK:- They're so minor, they're not even worth mentioning...Overall:  This is my new favorite ""point-n-click"" (kinda), platform, adventure game -- one of my few 10 out of 10's."

Anyways, you always can access hints for a little help if needed.The only downside of the game is the crappy Uplay, unfortunatelly you can't avoid that.

I think everyone should play Valient Hearts, becuase then people can realize that these are the games that make gaming great.

Despite the doom & gloom outlook surrounding the game's setting, Valiant Hearts stands head and shoulders above perceived conceptions to deliver a mesmerizing moment of brilliance complete with scenarios of joy, sadness, and complete empathy.It is one thing to create an entertaining product about World War I and tell a story -- it is another to tell that story while dismissing the overall whitewashing of general World War I history taught in schools and to be able to provide facts and lessons through a valuable medium such as videogames. As a fan of our written history, I would not only like to thank Ubisoft Montpellier for sticking to what I was most concerned about i.e. telling a story about World War I without blemishing it... I feel it is also noteworthy enough to celebrate what the development team have crafted by going above and beyond what I had initially hoped. Mentions and depictions of foreign countries fighting the war effort (Canada, India, Tunisia - represent!), including heart-wrenching personal letters from both sides of the conflict illustrating that no matter our lineage or culture we are all human.On the centenary ""celebration"" of one of the greatest infamous events in our history -- one in which we still feel the aftershocks today -- I feel overjoyed to experience something like this in an entertainment medium form that I've spent immersed and loved dearly for almost three decades of my life. And yet it is World War I. There are portrayals of trench warfare, there are portrayals of troops blindly running over no-man's land in the hope of a few more metres to build more trenches. But this one feels right. We witness the events of World War I through the eyes of four controllable characters (five if we demand to include the medical dog) and through all of these events we see many parts of the Great War. The launch of machine guns as a defensive mechanism, the introduction of gas warfare, the importance that nurses played upon the battlefield, the harrowing experience of artillery raining down upon people, and the debut of three weapons which were defining moments in both theatres of World War II - the tank, the aeroplane, and the flamethrower.In terms of gameplay, the puzzles themselves are not troubling due to common sense, and veterans of adventure games may find them trivial, yet the biggest stickler of all adventure games is whether the puzzles themselves make any sense to what is happening to the character in the universe. Thankfully Valiant Hearts avoids this quagmire. Controls are simple and neat both with M&KB interface alongside controller of choice. So far there have not been any issues regarding playability and it has that Ubisoft Montpellier polish to it. My only downfall is the fact that, despite the characters speaking their own form of mumbled speech within the game that is easy to understand (French characters saying ""merci"" while American character says ""thanks"") - it's a little disheartening to hear Emile, a major French character, speak in an English accent during story sequences at the beginning of a chapter. Perhaps a harmless contra, but one that grinds my teeth in little ways. This game also modestly steals the ""greatest title screen music"" from Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy XIII respectively at the same time.Don't let the 2D animated quality of the graphics fool you. This game is full of grim, yet majestic, atmosphere. The mere fact that Ubisoft Montpellier managed to capture the real-life concept that death is everywhere and these people struggled through an immense scale of adversity in order to live through over 4 years of hell should be enough to reconsider and think about what the ""lost generation"" went through.Highly recommended."

The art-style, the cutscenes, the music, all make a really great atmosphere. There's also a lot of historical facts and such that show plenty of respect to the history involved.The downside is that the actual gameplay gets very repetitive, very fast. It follows the model of point-and-click style games,  with puzzles involving scouring the area, looking for the item you can pick up and place where needed to advance onward. There's also certain sections that have a ""Guitar Hero""-like rhythm mini-game, which was cool the first few times, but got old fast. The slow pace of the gameplay makes the whole experience drag on a lot more than it really should.Ultimately, there's a really great WWI story and visual novel here, that's bogged down by gameplay that's just too repetitive and slow to make it worth it. If you're super into WWI history, to the point that you're willing to force your way through the gameplay, then go for it.

,Recommended,260230,17417468,"Posted: 6 August, 2015",all,Haruka,"Aside the Worms franchise I am not into war-themed games but in these last days I've found a new exception to the rule, Valiant Hearts: The Great War, and with very good reasons.The game is based up in events of the First World War and you meet characters you get to play with each in the course of the game: Emile, Freddie, Anna and Karl along with the company of Walt, a loyal Doberman Pincher that will help you a lot in different puzzles and situations. All the human characters share a different story each and see their destinies crossed to overcome the war. The story is excellent. It links with loyalty with real events from the First World War and aligned with the really well made English narrative (it reminds me of historical documentaries), it captures your interest and curiosity to know what's going to happen next. You end up getting a great sympathy towards the main characters and feel greatly involved, and you definitely figure that out in Chapter 3 and 4, the last chapters of the story. Even the way it ends, although I was not expecting such a closure (I'm still shaking, I just finished the game minutes ago but I found Chapter 4 very intense. I even had tears on my eyes at a point!) I do believe it was an honest ending. Lets remember that what happened around a century ago wasn't pink and roses.The gameplay consists in a mixture of platforming (although you don't jump in this game), puzzle and historical. You need to explore your surroundings to look for clues in dropped objects, talk to characters, look carefully to the scenario, etc. There's no actual dialogue between the characters, pictograms are used instead inside talk-balloons and they are very efficient to understand what they are trying to tell you. The puzzles are very very clever. I found a lot of variety and not all of them were piece of cake, you really need to explore well your surroundings if you want to continue. They aren't super hard but expect to lose few time thinking a little. Due to the nature of the game (more in particular the fact the characters do not jump) the controls (sharp by the way) aren't very complex and don't require a high dexterity but don't think it is because of that that you will be bored: the game features some interesting real-time events that might require a little more dexterity like avoiding missles, covering yourself and your companions, healing someone, etc. The human characters share a special ability each too: Emile can dig through soil, Freddie can clear up barbed tape paths and Anna can heal people. Being a game based up in historical facts, as soon as you progress diary entries and historical facts are unlocked. The diary entries tell you more about the characters of the game and their thoughts in the course of the story and historical facts tell you about different real facts from the First World War which are pretty educative. These elements help the player to understand more the contexts of the game. As a bonus for explorators/collectors there are more than 100 historical items to collect during gameplay with a description that tells you more about them. Again, it is educative and helps to understand more the context of the game. The objects are discrete enough to be easy to miss them, especially if you own a small display/resolution so make sure you look everywhere!The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, just like they were in Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends: both games developed by the same studio and in the same game-engine. Everything is hand-drawn under a high-definition digital format but the cartoony look works really well for the atmosphere of the game. It is not kiddy but at the same time it is not too realistic. The perfect balance. If the game circunstance allows you, please play calmly and appreciate the view. There is too many good detail to ignore. The animations are equally irreprehensible.The music and sound are equally excellent. The music is orchestral and marries really well with what's going on in the screen. There is even a small treat for music/rhythm lovers with some ingame-events that require a perfect syncronization with musics like the French Cancan! The sounds are varied and adequated. I would like to congratulate the voice actors in particular both for their work in the English narrative and in the gibberish language of the characters. Despite the human characters talk gibberish I can ensure you that in the highest moments of the story, their voice performance will give you the shivers.Complaints? To be honest it felt quick but that was probably because I was really immersed in the game. I will have to start it over anyway to collect the items I've missed but without me noticing I played over 10 hours!Since I heard about this game for the first time in a E3 reveal I was interested in it despite of being a war-themed game. I decided to take the risk and I don't have any regret. Ubisoft Montpellier once more showed the brilliant team it has got in the studio like it already proved to have with the Rayman titles it developed before. Valiant Hearts: The Great War is worth every cent and is 100% recommended to every fan of bidimensional platformers, with diverse puzzles to solve, scenarios to explore and like to hear (and feel) a good story."

I like the graphics too, not a hard game (the last chapter was a bit harder though). Always made me connect with the character that I play with. Lots, I mean, LOTS of feelings are in the game.I would recommend it to all the war-related-story likers. Let's say that it's a minimum of 5-10 hours of intense play, maybe even more if you can't figure out many of the puzzles."

I went into it knowing a fair amount of knowledge about the first world war. I knew it was bad, and that good men and women died for very little reason. But this game, it put it into a perspective for me. You follow a few different characters setting out for different reasons into the war to end all wars. Each has a moving and detailed background, each has a personality and a reason to fight. You connect with them in a lot of ways, and the funny thing is that you'll never see their eyes.I bought this game because I wanted a story. I was moved to tears from the trailer, and I knew I had to have it. I couldn't stop playing it, and so I beat it in a single sitting. I don't regret doing so, but I regret that it had to end. Between the visually stunning world, beautifully well used music and cues, tricky and interesting puzzles, and the sometimes comical action sequences, I simply could not stop.That, and though I haven't researched it, I am quite sure this game is historically accurate to a T. Finding artifacts with detailed descriptions throughout the levels or just following the general story line, you learn just what it meant to fight The Great War."

Emile, the french farmer and Karls father-in-law who focuses on solving all sorts of different puzzles with the help of his dog companion Walt. Freddie, the american volunteer who focuses on running forward, dodging mortars and knocking down anything and anyone in front of him with his fists and Anna, the belgian student turned medic who focuces on healing and saving wounded soldiers and civilians.Despite this game having a rather silly and friendly looking art style, you should not let that fool you since you will be taking cover from machine-gun fire behind the corpses of your fallen comrades, watch adult men shiver in fear and see innocent civilians cry over the loss of their family members. The game goes from gut punch to gut punch to the occasional kick in the heart as you, the player, will have to watch these loveable and colourful characters fight their way through the seven rings of hell without knowing that the more they fight, the more horrible it's going to get.A true testament to the bravery of every army man who has ever lived, who I feel, does not get the respect they deserve. Doesn't matter if they are american, british, french, japanese, german etc. Any man or woman who can pick up arms and risk their lifes for the safety of their family and country, is a true hero."

They really got the right balance there. Unfortunately this all comes with the cost of very simple gameplay, that feels more like something they implemented, so the whole thing can be released as a ""game"". No minus point for me, but if I had to complain about something it must be the characterization of the germans. I was very disappointed to see that there is no deeper thought behind them and all they serve for is the villains. Just because germans are bad and they need no reason to be so. For a game that is trying to be historically correct, to some extend at least, it's just very lazy. Or maybe it's a french-canadian thing, not letting germas be human as well. The only german we can sympathize with is the one who actually left that ""evil country"" to live in the ""great nation"" of france. And don't get me wrong, I couldn't care less about my own roots here... I'm a brazilian living in germany, grew up in austria and a big part of my family is jewish with roots in lebanon. So it's really just the portrayal that made me sad... to realize the game I hoped to be so much more, falls into the same bland trap of stereotypes like a Call of Duty or Wolfenstein. Heck, even Wolfenstein differs better... Sorry for the rant.Still, great game nonetheless and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes storytelling and historical settings. :)"

I played it for a couple of minutes but then it faded away again back into the masses of games in my steam library.Some days ago I picked up playing it again.I finished it just a couple of minutes ago.The ending sent shivers down my spine, I got goosebumps and I got sad. There's not many games that makes me feel sad, almoast none.This game will play with your feelings without you knowing it, it dosn't have great grapichs, alot of action or killing. You will never even hold a rifle in the game. But it dosn't make this into a bad game, it makes it into a great game. I would even go so far to say that I see this game as a piece of art.You can notice that the developers put a piece of thier hearts and souls in this game, it has a great story, many collectibles and alot of events that will make you feel satisfied.This game requiers a 3rd party software, Uplay. But the game compensates with that just by being a great game. But then I dont realy hate Uplay, I just dont like it. Just like I dont like to walk my dog when it's raining outside.In this game you will follow a couple of persons on their way through the great war.Emile, the french man that will do anythig for his wife and country.Carl, the german that is married to Emile's daughter and have been exiled from france and sent back to germany.Anna the belgian that devotes her heart and soul to save people from dying.Freddie the american that joins the war in the pursue of revenge.Each one of these characters will have a kind of uniqe missions and you will try your best to find all the collectibles and finnish the missions on record time.I love this game, I even think that it has replay value.There's not many games that will teach you history this good. I learnt more from this than from school, I got more of an insight into a soldiers life in the trenches from this game than from any book, movie or other game I've ever seen/read/played.Sometimes i even thought about how I would react if I were there and I ended up thinking that most of the times I wouldnt be able to do the most. It could both depend on my lacking courage or strenght.There were heroes on both sides of the war, it dosn't matter what you were fighting for, Men and women devoted their lifes for their countries, families, thoughts and faith.

In this game, you play as Emile, Karl, Anna and Freddie and discover how their lives have been affected by the war.Each character has their own interesting story and discovering how the war affects their lives and their friendships as you go along can be quite heartwrenching. Throughout the game, a friendly dog named Walt accompanies these characters on their travels, helping them solve different puzzles in their path and together bear witness to the brutality of The Great War. Seeing the destruction of Europe in this way truly made me feel sad for each character as they struggle desperately to survive. And every twist and turn in the game really keeps you on the edge, making you wonder what other dangers lurk beyond the trenches as you explore the area, and for how long each character's luck will last.The lovely cartoonish art style of the characters and the environment around them is quite refreshing and the soundtrack is simply beautiful, as expected from a game powered by UbiArt Framework, one of Ubisoft's in-house game engines.Apart from the creative gameplay, collectibles and fact files are included in each section of the game, where you can read different information about everything from what their soldiers identification tags looked like to the devastating attack strategies that were used during the war.I am not disappointed with anything about the game itself, but rather the fact that for such a short game of only 4 chapters long, it is a little bit expensive and that in order to even play the game, you would need to create a Uplay account and access it from there. However, these are only minor issues I have with the game.Valiant Hearts is quite an amazing game for gamers who want to sit back and become emersed within a gripping story, accompanied by intense battles and unfortunate losses. It is by far one of my favourite games of this year and it is certainly worth playing."

The gameplay is nothing exceptional, a few puzzles here and there, some challenging, but most of them pretty straightforward. However, what this game does well is the narrative. You follow the story of a handful of characters during the World War I, most of them soldiers. The game succeeds in portraying the sacrifices of the normal soldiers who fought in the front lines as well as some heartbreaking stories of their families' struggles.

Each character has its own abilities and you switch from one another quite often. The parts with Walt, the dog, offers some co-operation and Anna healing skill is made through mini-games. You  drive cars and tanks at some point. There's also a part of riddles, sometimes not so easy to figure out and some infiltration. The diversity of the gameplay makes its strength.VISUALS, MUSIC & ATMOSPHERE: The visuals are excellent, all made in 2D they recreate perfectly the atmosphere of the early 20th century. Ypres, Le Chemin des Dames, Paris. Each location has its own ""flavour"". The music is very powerful, quite reminiscent of the soundtrack ofAmelie Poulainsometimes. Very French anyway.STORY: If you've ever wondered what was the life of a common soldier in the Great War, I think you will get the first answers here. The story is about four destinies entwined together. Four different people in the horrors of the war and how they get through it, or not... They are German, French, American, Belgian, they fight for different reasons: vengeance, duty, honnor? Most of them are fighting for the one they love. There are many twists in the story and even if the game explores adult themes like death, blind justice, loss and despair, it is in a way surprisingly optimistic: there's humanity even in the most horrific times.____________________________Gameplay4/6Visuals, music and atmosphere6/6Story6/6Length1/2--Global Rating17/20Some made it, some did not but they all deserve to be remembered.

'Valiant Hearts' is about four people forced to live through one of the most tragic and trying eras imaginable.That isn't to say that 'Valiant Hearts' doesn't contain a wealth of information about the First World War.  Through the characters you alternate between controlling - a German soldier, a French conscript, an American volunteer, and a Belgian nurse - you experience different aspects of the war: the initial excitement of the call to battle, the terrors of the trench, the desperate fight to save lives.  Historical facts and objects provide additional real-life context.The gameplay is straightforward.  In between the occasional stealth and driving segments, you'll be pulling levers and solving find-and-fetch puzzles.  The puzzles are neither easy nor especially hard; they feel appropriately sized as a driver for the main narrative.It's this narrative that is the true star of the game.  Backed by a wonderfully melancholy soundtrack (and leavened by moments of odd hilarity), it forces the player to understand history - not as an abstract catalog of dates and facts, but as a story with real human stakes that still relate today.--------------------When the bullet cameI closed my eyes, saw your faceAnd went home at last."

You move left or right, climb up or down, whack enemies from behind, throw stuff,  dig, interact with levers and other objects.  I found the puzzles in the game not too difficult, but still rewarding when you solve them.  There are also mini-games where you would usually have to dodge bombs and bullets. Perfect for those who would primarily like to experience the story [and maybe not so good for those who are into super fast-paced action games].  A nice element is how you work with the dog to solve some of the puzzles.I was quite surprised with how they made the game evoke so much emotions given the art style used and the fact that there weren’t any spoken dialogue.  It’s mostly narration and reading of letters.  When characters talk to each other a bubble would usually pop up with the images of what they are trying to say, or you hear some indistinct babbling.  But it works.  And the music.  Just beautiful.  The melancholic intro music alone gave me so many feels.I love how we don’t play as any famous war person here.  We are common folk and we see how the war affects their lives.  I am going to see how the game explores this more.  I am excited to find out what happens next, but at the same time I am quite terrified.  I sense tragedy in the future.

Although the game is full of puzzles, the game has a hint system to help you if you're stuck! The game is really well made. The story is quite dark and well strung together. The characters are ones that you will love! Play the game to enjoy a fun, yet gritty and dark story of sadness and death. For Example: On one of the missions, you play through a level in Verdun, A battle that lasted 300 days and had 600,000 casualties. Imagine that. Put it into a game. Amazing!

From the unique art style, in-game facts about WW1 and its music. You actually feel as if you are a part of this world. Beautiful yet horrific, we are thrown into the Great War as several group of characters. Each with their own ambition and goals, they set out on a journey against all odds.StyleEvery thing about this game is perfect (no......not you Uplay. You f*cking suck). The art style is cartoony with a bright color palette. This works well when you aren't put in the actual war itself because it captures the beauty of the early 1900's. During war sequences, the palette becomes more dulled and gritty. There isn't a lot of blood and gore but this game doesn't need it. It has already captured the horrors of war.SoundtrackEasily one of the best this game has to offer. As soon as you boot up the game, you are greeted by a sorrowful melody. It will tug at your heart strings because you know the feels will come. The game features some awesome classic tracks from its era.GameplayThere is no fighting, shooting, or sillyness of any kind. This game is a straight puzzler (with 2 or 3 car chase sections). Now you don't have to be a genius to figure out how to solve these puzzles. They are quite literally easy and smart. If you do get stuck, the game has a hint system. As a 2-D puzzler the game is deep and engaging. There are at least 100 collectibles to find and a ton of facts behind the Great War. This game will not only tear your heart to shreds, but you will become a lot more educated after the game is over. You'll be a crying genius.StoryWow.....The story is engaging and it hooks you immediately. The first five minutes everything is fine and dandy until suddenly sh*t hits the fan and quite a lot of it. You first play as Emile who is a French grandfather. He is pulled into the war by force and learns that his son-in-law Karl (who is German) has also been forced to fight in the war. Emile goes out to search for Karl and makes a lot of friends during his journey. Each character you meet has a backstory and a reason why they joined the war. You care a lot about these characters and each one has their quirks.Verdict10 out of 10. IHIGHLYrecommend this game to anyone. Valiant Hearts is a game that only shows the Great War (or any war for that matter) on the surface. It will teach you to appreciate what you have now and what it took to maintain it. You will see the horrors of war unlike any game I have ever seen. But be warned, should you dare buy and play this game, BRING A F*CK TON OF TISSUES!!!"

Like the Indian Army and the Canadians during Vimy Ridge. And it didn't colour the Germans as totally evil. The grunts were just guys who had to go to war just like everyone else. There's a section in the game that perfectly illustrates the idea that past the countries and nationalism, these are just people.The characters were great, While the characters actually talk to each other, they're all very emotive and can express what they're feeling to each other. There are letters in the game that give us a behind the scenes of what each character is thinking about during certain parts of the war. There's Emile the tired grandfather and father, Karl the desperate husband and father, Freddie a man about revenge, Anna the caring daughter and Walt the faithful and loyal dog. Such great characters that are all tied together through love and longing of family. Love and friendship are such a huge part of this game.The story was very depressing but also appropriate given the material. World War 1 was a very bloody war. There are instances of levity during the game where the game has car chases that have classic music playing in the background. Overal I thought Ubisoft Montpellier showed a lot of care and love with the game and the history involved as there's extensive material that you can read up within the game whenever picking up collectables.The comic book visuals aping Franco-Belgian art gave me serious Tin Tin and Asterix & Obelix vibes. It's a beautiful game and Ubiart continues to impress.If there's one thing I didn't like it's the rhythm game sections in which you're healing injured but they were thankfully only used with Anna.Anyway I highly recommend everyone play this game.

So it's a mixture of action, adventure and puzzle game which also challenges the player's skill and concentration.Don't let the comic book-like visual style confuse you: This game does not hide or relativize the horrors of this war. Sure, there are no deformed faces or guts seen in the game but still enough blood and corpses to keep serious and yet it's not glorifying the lust for blood.In a time where one war ego shooter after another gets made, ""Valiant Hearts"" touches the player's heart due to the characters and the constant reminders of humanity and kindness between (or even in the middle of) battles.Sure, the game has its funny and lighter moments, too. But they hardly ever make the whole story and situation look silly.The puzzles are quite easy but fun to solve. And the game gets more and more intense the further the player goes.You can also collect information about World War I, achievements and special hidden items which served special purposes back then.And last but not least: This game can be a real tearjerker at the latest in the final chapter.In a nutshell: I can definitely recommend ""Valiant Hearts"" to about anyone.

The entire tale is told in the span of four chapters.The gameplay of this title can be best described as a series of sequences or scenarios you have to complete in order to advance further: some of them are rather action-based with a pletora of objectives (which range from dodging enemy fire while you advance, to having to hide from enemy soldiers while you sneak around, ...), with your character getting killed in case you'll screw up, and more peaceful levels mainly focusing on puzzle solving. It's worth mentioning that, as puzzles go, Valiant Hearts isn't exactly particularly challenging: also, should you get stuck on a particular task, you'll recive an hint or two after some time. A recurring mechanic involves around ordering a red cross dog, Walt, to fetch you certain items or push a lever in order to advance.The gameplay proper is completed by hidden collectables objects you can find to gain even more historical trivia and history and characters' diaries entries you'll unlock by simply completing the various levels.The game's style is reminiscent of a Franco-Belgian comic (think of The Adventures of Tintin, for instance), which by any means doesn't deprive from the horror of the war in the slightest. The musical score is also quite good (with some sequences using actual pieces from famous classical tracks).All things considered, Valiant Hearts: The Great War is an adventure game which is more invested into showing the first World War in all its tragedy and detail than to provide the player with a great challenge.

The best thing they released in 2014. It's related to the 100th anniversary of the start of WW1 and is filled with historical facts. Despite goofy and cartoony art style (which looks great) it shows the war in a way you wouldn't expect. EVERYONE suffers in war and that it's a gruesome thing that destroys lives of all involved.

,Recommended,260230,13018750,"Posted: 20 November, 2014",all,Typhoone,"Valiant Hearts is more an interactive story than a game. Wrapped in a World War I puzzle-platformer, this story is not a challenge to play through. Puzzles have no complexity and the player is only dealing with one at a time. Challenges primarily involve pickup and deliver quests between elements on the level, block pushing, block pulling, and shape-matching. There are a few platformer-style action sequences reminiscent of Frogger-style gameplay. These same sequences are timed to epic orchestral music, which at least makes them enjoyable if not a frustrating chore put in to progress the game's story.There is a meta-game of finding historical items. Every level possesses a half-dozen collectibles that can be found and picked up. They serve no gameplay purpose and are completely optional, but come with facts relating them to the historical setting of the level they are found in. Paired with multi-paragraph articles introducing the historical significance of the different settings of the game's levels, this adds an element to Valiant Hearts that transcends the colorful animated cartoon warfront and grounds it in historical context.Don't play it for the puzzles, play it for the story and for the beautiful art style. The level backdrops and bullish character art evoke the war setting magnificently and even bring it some enjoyable color which realistically did not exist. Unfortunately, animations are not particularly well-executed and there is one severely lacking artistic element: blood. In a game set in a theme of death and destruction, purposefully not including blood in the game (likely to maintain ratings standards) harms the ability to tell a story as powerful and evocative as Valiant Hearts.Finally, a sweeping storyline with a twist of historical education around the setting of WWI cannot ignore the subject of death. The characters traverse several death-defying accounts throughout the game's four chapters as the player believes the protagonists are immune to war's ultimate price for the sake of story progression. At times, this is a bit ridiculous, with dozens of animated characters being mowed down by machine gun fire while the player continually respawns to pass the movement-timed trench-death puzzles. Ultimately, the game addresses the topic of death as a part of the finale and it is potentially one of the more controversial moments that will keep this art-piece game out of classrooms. It's hard to tell if it is a well-placed plot-twist element or a final historical morality message written into the narrative, but it works very well.In summary, Valiant Hearts is a brilliantly packaged, historically sprinkled interactive fiction. The puzzles are overtly simple and linear, but this is a game you play for the experience rather than the challenge. Going forward, while I believe there are too many World War Two-themed games out there, a Valiant Hearts sequel: WWII would be a worthy cut above the rest. Let's hope it gets made. In the meantime, experience World War One through the moving story Valiant Hearts."

Granted its one of the only WWI game I played, but as someone who have played many war base game ranging from FPS to RTS, this easily blow  all of them out of water in terms of story.Story:Valiant Hearts follow around Emile, Karl, Freddie, and Anna through the war. You watch as all their stories line up together and they must help one another to survive. The fact that they tell this story with virtually no dialog is amazing. The characters simply grunt and show speech bubbles with a picture in them to get their point across. Even with the this cartoonish way of communication and in the art style, the game nail the style and atmosphere of this time period. Honestly I wish I could speak more about each character story but I don't want to spoil any part of it. Also it was nice to see that they added a historical fact tab so that you could get some real facts on WWI. Always nice when a game include little bits of facts over whatever time period they're covering.Gameplay:The gameplay involve moving one of the control characters throughout a 2D map to find items or tools to help you to complete task or solve a puzzle. The player actions is generally limited to throwing and pulling levers, but there are some characters with special abilities or tools. These special abilities generally have a slightly different play style to give you some uniqueness between each character. Such as Emile being able to dig through certain areas or Anna doing button prompting mini game. Nothing ground breaking, but the puzzles are enough to keep you entertained and can even stump you sometime.Final Comments:I know WWI is a hard era to make a game for since so much of it was static trench warfare. Most people don't want to play a game where you spend half the game in a trench and the other half running through a kill-zone while you get riddled with machine gun fire and artillery barrage.  But Valiant Hearts use this to it advantage by focus on the individuals force to deal with these horrors. You become attached to these characters, and don't want to see bad things happen to them. This attachment motivate you to keep playing to see how this war will end for them. Also I like how they just don't straight up demonize one side as the ""bad guy"" but rather show that at the end of the day, it was just a bunch of people fighting to stay alive and get back home.I would easily trade in many of the Call of Duty, Battlefield, and other war games campaign stories for this one. I found great pleasure in the game and even greater in the story it told."

It's a simple sidescrolling puzzler with moments of platformer challenges, which by itself might not be a great selling point, but the way it immerses you into the story it's telling is unmatched.  From the detailed background/backdrop pieces that many could overlook, to the running between cover to dodge artillery and machine gun hellfire.  What would normally be just a part of another game is now riveting and intense because you feel for these characters, even the untold number you see around you living out their own hell in the war.  What many FPS war games tried to accomplish, this game here perfected in an unexpected way.  I knew it would be a moving story and historical piece, but looking beyond that, if all the characters were aliens and this was a game set on some planet light years away, I would still be as moved by this game due to the immersiveness that is packed into every detail. Bravo to everyone that worked on this game, truly a masterpiece."

So why you should play it? Let me tell you.The game is set into the time of the Great War, WWI. This topic is interesting enough. But that is not where it stops. You are not playing as a heroic Rambo character. You are a man/woman made out of flesh who might get killed by shrapnel, bullet, falling tree or whatever. Pulsing eye and standing in the cover for a moment will not heal you. You are not professional soldier, you were born to work in peace and love, not to shoot. Like most of us. You are Émile, an aged man and French farmer. You are Karl, a young man of German origin and husband of Émile's daughter. You are Anna, a young Belgian nurse. And you are Freddy, an American guy who took part in this war to make revenge. Why? You have to play that. Ah, and one additional character which is not human. You will find out.The story of Valiant Hearts is the main reason why you should play this piece. There are episodes from the battlefield, but also from another locations, e.g. Paris or training ground. Oh, and there are also Fast and Furious: WWI! In addition, the storyline is not fictional. It is based on the real events and real letters which were sent by the people captured in that madness. This is developed even more with varied items you might pick in each level. These might be helmets, tunafish tins, letters, etc. Every item has its own story which is written in the special menu. It brings me to another point - educational dimension of this game. Although I thought in know much about the WWI, I found out that this was simply not true. I also realized that the WWI is UNJUSTLY played down by the WWII because of its dynamics, warmachines etc. But the subject of the WWI has much to offer! Personally, I would demonstrate the topic of the WWI  taught in schools on this game. Like a homework and lead the discussion about it. How lovely does it sound: Playable homework...Now something about graphics and soundtrack. Both are perfect. I love the UbiArt engine. I loved that in Rayman: Origins and I continue in loving it. In my opinion, this artsy engine played an indisputably positive role in this game. The soundtrack is mainly sad (thanks to that war, I suppose) but also cute and makes the atmosphere complete.Conclusion...finally, you definitely think. Well, I think that I made myself clear on this topic - I loved this game and I completely recommend it. For Europeans it should be obligatory, but since there are wars wherever in this world. it should be played there where a war was or may occure. We shall not forget. 93/100.PS: Point about the purchase. I bought this game 50 percent sale for 8 euros. This is the price definitely worth it. Normal price of 15 euros is the borderline. If it was 12 euros, it would be much better."

I learnt a lot about World War 1 during the game, that I didn't need to pretend I'm a history buff now that Battlefield 1 is out soon, and scour Wiki and act like a 'I know aaaall there is about the weapons'.So, what did I think overall?Well, I love the fact that its a cartoony game, but the characters are very well done, and you actually get immersed in the storyline.The music at the very beginning before you play the game is very nice, and there are all sorts of tracks throughout the game.I also liked the fact that you wern't just playing as character A, then B and so on, but switching around now and then, and in some cases, meeting together.The collectables are good, but for once its not just 'you found a bit of soap' but a little bit of history about it. Plus, apart from the story of the game, there are actual photo's and descriptions that appear that make you realise how crappy the war really was.Some bits that I found infuriating though: being the nurse and using the heart monitor to do first aid. I nearly lost the will towards certain parts. And the digging is a strange one, but once you figure it out its ok.But, if you like 'adventure-type' puzzle games with a great storyline, I recommend this wholeheartedly.Get it, you won't be disappointed.Also, a short game review here, about 6 mins long :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CO_AnYrLLg"

The main gameplay mainly revolves around solving puzzles and advancing through each given stage. The art is beautifully hand drawn from every scenery from cheerful to desolate. The soundtrack is incredibly great and fitting for any and all stages of the game. The story is simple, yet contains an underlying complexity as it portrays the horrors of war. My favorite and most surprising mechanic is the real world information the game provides in the form of both collectibles and backstory text. It was very rewarding each subsequent event our character is partaking in, or the use/purpose of an item our character picks up off the ground.10/10 Amazing game"

The nonvoilent nature of the game and the large amounts of simple puzzles are entertaining at first but get tiring rather quickly.

Still, the different stories come together neatly in the end and there is definitely a good climax, which will, in some parts of the game, trigger tears. My main criticism goes toward the stereotypes which are inflicted. As a German, i'm sick of soldiers being portrayed as blonde, somehow evil, grumpy giants who are drinking beer and eating Kraut all the time. There are alternatives, e.g. I would have liked to play as one of the many Jewish soldiers in WW1. Stereotypes in most other games are far worse, at least they took up the idea of portraying the different nationalities as trapped in the conflict, which is much more historically accurate than the usual bull****.Gameplay:Not a usual side scroller, there are many advancements to the concept. The gameplay in Valiant Hearts is not groundbreaking but still fun. You can throw grenades, get to solve interesting puzzles, punch people.Atmosphere:I really liked the coherent design of characters and the world, I've not seen any style like it.

It took me around 6-7 hours to finish the story itself and every second was worth listening and paying attention to the story. The idea of it taking place in WW1 was a brilliant idea as I feel no other time period could have nailed the ride feeling. Of course anyone who has played and beat this game would tell you that the ending was devastatingly saddening as it was also a great way to conclude the adventure. I give the story a 10/10 as it will always remain as a favorite game.Gameplay:Just to get this out of the way, my opinion may be a little one sided due to the fact that I have a huge heart for puzzle games. The idea of the story being played out through puzzles that were also intense at times really made me feel likeI needed to keep going and wanted to play more. I mean even the idea of getting hints from the messenger pigeon made me giggle a little and I loved that idea. However I feel as if I had to ask my self many times ""What is going on"". Like however a minecart managed to land on the tip of a tree branch made me kinda question the game. The idea of actualy war facts and info being included in the game made me really interested as I read all if not most of the info on the collectables that you may find during the game. I give the gameplay a 8.5/10 due to the fact that a lot of the time, whatever was happening should not have happened and did not make sense.I recommend this game more for people who have patience and a high tolerance for solving puzzles.

The game really stands out to me because of how much heart it really has and by the end how invested you feel in the characters struggles. It differs from traditional war games by not making the war about fighting a soulless enemy. The game is about helping the people who are being hurt by the war, allied, enemy or civilian. One part the stuck out to me was when you come across a stuck enemy solider in a mine, you help him out and you both work together to escape the mine. On your way out, you get caught by enemy soldiers and he saves your life in turn. The game really is good at putting the point across that you are fighting people who are in the same situation as you but were stuck on the other side of the line when boarders were drawn. The game is satisfying and emotionally engaging and has an adorable loyal dog following you around the whole time. The game and its puzzles are not particularly difficult and usually really easy to figure out but it fits the direction of the game and they are often worked into the story so I don’t fault it for that.

I played Valiant Hearts in a difficult time in my life where it seemed like the world was such a dark place where no one cared much about human connection. I owe it to Valiant Hearts to say that  it reminded me of the beauty of relationships between humans (and dogs).It's sappy, but it doesn't make it any less true. This is the heart of Valiant Hearts, so if you're rolling your eyes at this review I would have a hard time recommending it. More than anything The Great War is plot driven with puzzles and stealth segments sprinkled throughout. It doesn't break new ground with its gameplay. I would decide the game mediocre if it weren't for the plot that drives it. You take control of four different characters as we're told their individual stories and how they intertwine during World War I. These characters all have motives and reasons for being involved in the war and the writing does splendidly in building sympathy for them. By the end of the game you feel as if you're parting from dear friends--you feel as if you've through hell with them. Indeed, the game is darker than you may expect, as the gruesome brutality of the war is shown rather bluntly at some points.These brutal and heartbreaking moments contrast with silly segments of making great escapes or solving little puzzles. While I appreciate the artist direction of the presentation, it felt rather lopsided. It's hard to go from a driving segment with fast-paced/lighthearted music to scenes of death and destruction. It didn't happen often, but it did detract from the experience when it did. These moments are in no way a deal-breaker--this is a story that should be experienced. Just be warned that the beautiful soundtrack, in combination with the written direction and characters, will tug at your heartstrings. Something I'm a sucker for.As far as the gameplay is concerned, not much can be said. Most of it involves light puzzles and hectic segments where timing is key to avoid death. Combat is limited to throwing the occasional grenade into a bunker or sneaking up and smacking a guard on the back of the head with a ladle (or other makeshift weapon). I did find myself dying on a semi-regular basis but rarely did I blame anything but my own incompetence.There are also plenty of collectibles to find, and the game gives you many historical documents to comb through to brush up on the harsh reality that was World War I. I highly recommend Valiant Hearts to anyone who enjoys a good story or mild puzzle solving. I would buy it full price for the story but not the gameplay--if that helps in your decision at all."

I really appreciate the fact that the puzzles are not trial and error oriented but actually just require some exploration and logic. I'm not sure how long it took me to finish this game but I played it over several nights so I'd guess about 5-6 hours of content which is pretty good since I bought the game for less than $5. The music is incredible and synched with several parts of the game especially when you are driving the Jeep and dodging enemy attacks!Overall, I'd rate the game a solid 5/5 stars. I can't believe it took me so long to finally play this title and I'm happy to say it's one of my favorite games of 2014 although I played it in 2015."

It's refreshing to see a non-strategy game sticking to the actual facts, locations and events of the Great War instead of attempting to rewrite history. Despite the gorgeous cartoonish style of the game, it handles its heavy subject matter with the weight that it deserves.Gameplay of Valiant Hearts consists mostly of solving various environmental puzzles. There's really no platforming (you cannot jump) or even much killing involved, just exploring and picking up items. The mechanics are simple and easy to understand, but allow for surprisingly complex interactions.As the story switches between the four main characters, players get to witness the whole scope of the war from several interesting viewpoints, and there's enough variation for the experience not to start feeling repetitive. While there is no dialogue and the characters speak in gibberish, the point always gets across loud and clear and there's even some genuine drama involved.Ubisoft has been recently showing really good initiative with its small, indie-like releases that dare to take more risks than the bog-standard AAA blockbusters and Valiant Hearts: The Great War is up there with the best games of 2014 so far. Definitely worth a look."

Technically, you play four different heroes and solve puzzles while the story pushes you from one setting to the next. The story is linear, without deviations, and divided into four chapters.Within this technical setting of the game, it achieves quite a lot. The game focuses on some part of the Western front only from Ypres to Verdun. It tells the story of an American soldier, a French farmer, a German father and a Belgian nurse in the timespan from 1914 to 1917. It is all cartoon-style and this is reflected in the way the story is told. Many aspects are not realistic and widely exaggerated, but this is due to the cartoon-style, you shouldn't measure everything by real history. Just picking one example, take the taxi rides to ""Flight of the bumblebee"" while you throw explosives and try to evade bombs fired to the rhythm of the music. This is just a fun-mini-game and made me laugh (there's more of that in the game).The game is not difficult. You can try every challange over and over again without any negative effects. You will ""die"" quite a lot of times before you pick up every riddle, but that doesn't matter. The riddles themselves may sometimes be a bit too difficult, meaning that after two minutes of running around you just don't know how to solve it. But there are hints to every puzzle that will lead you to the right path. I used them a couple of times in order not to interrupt the game flow.As I said, the story is not quite realistic, but immersion into the game is definitely there. As you charge the enemy front line evading bombs, aircraft and enemy fire you really feel some of the danger these men must have felt. It actually helps here that it is a cartoon, since most of the action then happens in your head. When you go and have to save your friends, it got really exciting for me. The evil guy Baron von Dorf tries to ram down a steel door with his flamethrower tank and kill Freddie, the American soldier, while you as Emile try to stop from doing that by throwing a TNT bar into his face. If you're not fast enough, he'll get your friends and you lose. There are some situations like this, and although most of the times you don't actually have to run and be as fast as possible, it helps the immersion.The game develops as did the war. The first missions are still quite nice and fancy, but as the game progresses, the missions become more violent and bloody.The game gets a more serious touch by many small items that are spread over the game. You need to go some extra paths to get them, and the game rewards you with some honor medals when you manage to find all of them in one ""level"". They're items used in the war, from helmets to identification marks or biscuit cans. They come with a small description of their use and function, historically. Whenever some new episode begins like the gas war in Ypres, a small icon tells you that new historical information is available. You don't need to read this, but it helps to understand a lot of what was the historical background of that particular mission.Pros:- I really liked the historical immersion. The cartoon style fits quite nicely and the historical information is accurate and well written.- For a telltale game, 10 hours are quite a good playing time.- Some missions are really fun. I liked the taxi rides and the tank battle best- Walt, the dog- It is an exciting game. I wanted to play to see how it ends.Contra:- This Baron von Dorf is really quite silly. It helps the story line that there is some evil guy, though. Still, the bad guys are always the Germans- The puzzles may get a bit repetitive in the end.The game covers none of the other theatres of war, so nothing from the Eastern front or anything else that happened. I guess we need some more games covering those aspects.I recommend it to anyone interested in the period and looking for a light game and an entertaining story. I would buy it again."

,Recommended,260230,11019224,"Posted: 2 July, 2014",all,Shawn,"As a war-game fanatic and the typical war-movie-junkie, I'll write this review coming from that perspective, so bear that in mind when reading the belowmentioned review.Where to start? From the sudden E3 presentation and being released quickly thereafter, Ubisoft sure didn't have their usual delays as they unfortunately have done with Assassin's Creed series, Far Cry etc. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant surprise, not to mention a cheap on as well!The game starts right off with a well-crafted presentation of the charachters shown in the trailer (without giving away too much spoilers) and gives us the player a chance to adjust to their respective charachter development. This results in more or less a emotional roller-coaster, something that is really on of the phenomenal points about this game. It never fails to balance out the time playing as each charachter, never sacrificing anothers charachters story for another, something that is frankly rare to see in Ubisoft games (with exceptions like AC2, AC4 etc.) and games overall. Though this also goes hand-in-hand with HOW the game is presented. One of the reasons for example AC3 was considered a big failure was how it was presented: a well-crafted mess where it seemed like even the developers at Montreal didn't know HOW to present the story, what they wanted the players to experience etc. This is NOT the case with Valiant Hearts. Instead we are given a charming graphic engine (identical to the one in the higly praised Rayman games), a set of brave charachters, each with their own deep personalities and backgrounds, all intertwined masterfully without any form of sacrifice at the expense story-telling. Simply put, there is no confusion, no confusing story-gaps. Just one fluid experience.The only ""downside"" I can possibly think of after playing the game, is the somtimes complicated puzzles that that might be somewhat annoying to figure out, though even then you have your trustworthy war-pidgeon for help. Another one is the classic Uplay-annoyance we're all so familiar with. Fortunetely I didn't bump into any problems like the AC and Splinter Cell games.All in all, this game, given its low price is a MUST buy for any war-gamer out there. It might not be the next Call of Duty or MoH: Allied Assault that we all used to play. But it shows an entirely new theather of war: The First world war. Which honestly hasn't been really explained or shown in video-game form. As a history-nerd and an avid war-gamer, this is a great opportunity to throw yourself in the mustard-gas infested foxholes and trenches at the humble price of two Burger King menus in your local downtown.I'll give this game 5 delicious Sauerkrauten out of 5 possible!"

Is a game that takes you to a journey of how horror war can be; how much impact each soldier can affect his or her life in an instant. Of how a person feels for the first time ever of what it is to be afraid-this-is hell.HISTORY AND PLOTThe game was developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, inspired by letters from the Great War. This is a puzzle-adventure game where you played as four fictional characters. The very main character in the middle is Emile, a French farmer who lives in Saulcy-sur-Meurthe from when the war starts he was forced into becoming a French soldier and have to leave his daughter and grandson behind. On the left is Karl, a German farmhand who married Emile’s daughter and have a son, he was also forced to serve in the war but have to move to Germany to become a German soldier. In the far left is Anna an independent woman who is searching for her father and doing service with the French military as a medic. On your right is Freddie, an American soldier who volunteers in the French military for a vengeful purpose.There was going to be a fifth character to played as George (far right) the British pilot but it was cut off due to the character’s “personality” as humor and the company didn’t want it on a beautifully-sad atmospheric game. So you can only see him in one level of the game. Now I don’t understand why they could have just changed some of the writing to make the character a bit serious, but that is Ubisoft’s problem.I’m so glad that they set on the First World War and not the usual big 2. I keep seeing the second war topic over and over in games, documents, and museums and I’m tired of it. Now it doesn’t mean I hate hearing more World War 2, I always like learning new information and secrets to the Nazis. Is just that is weird that they don’t put as much of an impact to the Great War as the other. Sure the second war is much worse on the death toll and made a lot of psychological impact on many people that made hard decisions to the world leaders. But you have to remember how it all started the second war and how technology has change drastically in the first war.How did people react to the Great War? How did soldiers react to the first gas attack in the battle of Ypres. How did the politicians handle the situation? All these are as much important to learn as it is WW2. Maybe because the first war doesn’t have a lot of information due to lack of recording systems at the time, but it’s still can make a great story to it. Yes, you can find documents and videos about WW1 in YouTube or in Google but sometimes for me I can’t understand in some areas of that topic or any fun little facts about them (although sometimes I’m a bit lazy at researching it.)REACTION AND GAMEPLAYSince this is a puzzle-adventure game you will be solving some puzzles and I’m glad is not another shooting genre, please no more Call of Duty! Sometimes you will fight some enemies by sneaking at their backside and whack them; you will be accompanying your dog Walt to help you reach hard places and help you on certain puzzles. If it’s too easy for you because of the hint system or highlighted areas just turn them off by turning on Veteran mode.The story is one of the most beautifully written I have ever played. It focuses a lot on the characters and the situation around the soldiers in the war. Not a single side character is unimportant or poorly use in the game, same goes to the background characters. Each one reacts as a real person would feel; hungry, sad, pain, homesick, and hopeless.Then when you saw a soldier get shot you feel a little pain for the person to die and have to move on because it is your duty as a soldier to move forth into battle. Even the Germans feels exactly like their enemies are suffering. Is not like in any FPS (First person shooters) that you just shoot some enemies you don’t know of and move on or your comrades that you barely even knew dies and just keep going from point A to B. Hell sometimes you don’t even know who you’re playing as because you’re in first person view!The background is gorgeous with detail of what’s going on in the battlefield. One minute the land is peaceful the next is smoke clouds, rubble buildings and muddy grounds. In some levels you see on the background corpses everywhere and soldiers screaming in agony! Ubisoft aren’t afraid to show it and they nailed it! The music is also really nice with classical pieces from famous songs, sets the atmosphere flowing.There are collectables to find such as historical items that tells you fun facts about the war. In each level it tells you in the history facts menu about the war with pictures and documents, all thanks to Apocalypse World War 1 and 14 missions 18 Centenaire, who partnered up with Ubisoft. This is the only game in a long while since I completed a game with 100% all collectables; it was so much fun and interesting to learn new things! I’m not much of a completionist and getting all the historical items only gets you an achievement, but if you like fun facts like me collect them all!CONCLUSSIONYou probably can finish in nine hours and maybe an additional hour or two to collect all the historical items, so that’s eleven hours in total, that is an average good play through. The puzzles are decent, not too challenging but it is a perfect balance. This game gets a 10/10 a masterpiece collection and another perfect example of how games can teach us something and not always violence and corrupt us.If you can handle the issues it has that’s good, but it is so worth the effort to play, you won’t regretted. I “think” it has less restriction now so I’m glad is less of a hassle. Is also rated T for teen but I think preteens can experience and enjoy the beauty and horror of the Great War. Hope they keep making games like this; it is a breath of fresh air and I hope they make another game like it but in a different war setting."

The game covers the stories of 4 (from what I've seen, there may be more playable!) characters and a Dog companion across the entire duration of the War itself. Each character has their own identity and jobs that effectively show off the war from their own different perspectives. One minute you'll be charging into battle as Freddie and then tending to the wounded as Ana. It's also worth mentioning the game has a rather large educational part to it as well, as there are items scattered about that you can pick up such as letters and objects commonly used during the war that give you a history lesson about what they were used for.The artstyle is very pleasant and pleasing to look at, it's friendly enough to be attractive to every audience and depressing enough to please those looking for an sad emotional trip.All in all, buy the thing.

It is mostly told in a silent manner like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons with the exception of a narrator in between sub-chapters.The gameplay so far is mostly fairly simple puzzels, a bit of basic combat and old school dodge the objects mechanics timed on the beautiful background music. At first I was sceptical about the gamplay and I thought it would put me off, but luckly this is not the case. It doesn't have groundbraking mechanics though, so don't expect too much from that.I already know this isn't a game for the average gamer or for the masses, but for the gamer that wants a story experience in a World War 1 setting with amazing art and music.Are you looking for a platform and/or action game?

It of course is a puzzle game but the puzzles never really got very complicated but still feel rewarding when you complete them, but the main reason you should buy this game is for the story, it's based off stories from World War 1 and tells a story of love, loss, vengence, and companionship with 5 main characters (my favorite being the dog Walt) all just trying to survive the horrors of war and maintain their humanity. The story was absolutley amazing and I thought the art style was great. This isn't a game where you kill every enemy you see and feel like the ultimate badass you actually rarely ever have to harm the enemies. The characters become personal to you and you really want the best for them. The game teaches you that war is hell and that we should never forget the ones that have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. The game's story is about 6 hours to beat so if you are looking for a great game with great characters, fun and rewarding puzzels and gameplay, great soundtrack, a nice art style, and a fantastic story with tear-jerking moments then I highly recommend Valient Hearts: The Great War. 9/10"

,Recommended,260230,14116036,"Posted: 22 January, 2015",all,UpInFlames,"The Great War was quite possibly the most tragic and futile war in human history due to antiquated and barbaric imperial mindsets converging with modern warfare which resulted in an incredibly brutal conflict leaving tens of millions people dead or crippled. All sides in the war had very little regard to human lives consistently sending tens of thousands soldiers to their death for literally nothing. British comedy show Blackadder satirically stated that Britain would have been better off if they had just stayed home and shot 50,000 of their own men every day. It’s a grim thought, yet also a tragically fair point.Despite its deceptively cartoonish presentation, Valiant Hearts doesn’t shy away from accurately depicting the extent of tragedy seen in The Great War. Ubisoft Montpellier collaborated with the brilliant Apocalypse documentary series (which I wholeheartedly recommend if you want to learn more about this awful period of our history) in order to depict both the horror and humanity of the conflict. You will see the war from multiple sides including solders and civilians, French and German, but a singular constant remains throughout – seeing the war from the viewpoint of ordinary people.You aren’t playing as a nameless soldier on his bloody path to kill a million Germans, you’re playing as a person who has a family, hopes and dreams and just wants to make it out alive. The four playable characters include Anna; a Belgian nurse, Karl; a German deported from France forcibly leaving his French wife and son and being conscripted in the German army, Emile; Karl’s father-in-law conscripted in the French army, and an American volunteer Freddy. All four characters are brought together at times thanks to Walt; a conscripted German military rescue dog. The game takes place on the Western Front in parts of France and Belgium and involves iconic battles at Ypres, Verdun and the Somme.The gameplay mostly revolves around solving rather simple puzzles involving levers, finding and combining necessary items, but there are also some light action elements such as stealth segments, a few boss fights and even driving segments. Strictly mechanically speaking, the design is a bit repetitive, more effort could have been put into it, the puzzle design in particular. Contextually, however, the game is extremely varied and ranges from charging at the enemy, everyday life in the trenches, healing and even amputating soldiers, breaking out from a POW camp, driving a car and a tank, firing from a cannon and loads of other interesting things that so truthfully depict the war. There are a few segments which involve non-existing armored-type vehicles that act as boss battles, but they’re not overly jarring as they look as if they belong in the overall style and setting.The only truly bad part of the game is its use of Uplay. I’ve had plenty of problems with Ubisoft’s DRM dating back to StarForce and unfortunately, the publisher still hasn’t gotten its act together. Upon starting the game through Steam, nothing happened even though Steam indicated that I was running the game. The game wouldn’t start up, I couldn’t quit the game, I couldn’t exit Steam. I had to CTRL+ALT+DEL, then go to Start Task Manager – Processes in order to end the process (it wasn’t shown under running applications) and only then would Uplay and the game actually start up. I had to do this every time I started the game.Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a respectful tribute to all the peoples caught up in the futile affair, victims of their own rulers and callous, oftentimes quite insane High Command. It is also a truly great game that should be played not only for its engaging and varied design and appealing presentation, but also for its cultural value.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)"

Very few games these days grab a hold of your emotions and pull you in but this game does so and right from the start. I'm writing this at roughly two hours into the game (at the start of Chapter 2 in fact) and I have to say I'm impressed with what this game is already offering. The characters, stoic and of very few words they may be, are lovable and draw you straight into whats going on from the farmer turned reluctant soldier to the veternarian turned field medic.Honestly I could go on forever talking about what I've already experienced in this fantastic game so I won't bore you. All I'll say is buy it if you have any interest in it. It's definitely worth the $15 you'll spend.Like most other reviews I'll warn you this required Uplay to play so make sure you have it downloaded onto your computer (though I'm sure it'll force itself on you anyways).Edit: It's been awhile since I finally finished the game (well over 2 years I believe) but I felt I needed to update this review (after having played through it again on my PS4). Having gotten to the end of this wonderful game and having experienced the heartfelt emotions this game throws at you (those who have beaten it will know what I'm talking about, this is one of those few games where I have actually cried at the end) I can't recommend this game enough.

The game somehow manages to be both very silly and grounded in reality at the same time which is quite an accomplishment. It has characters that you care for and want to see them pull through. This game is a great history lesson for people who don’t know much about the first World War as the game depicts most of the events that happened during the war with the characters themselves experiencing it firsthand. As for the gameplay itself its very simplistic, I wasn’t a fan of the puzzles because they do bring the story to a halt and it forces you to get past a few obstacles before you continue on with the story. It can get frustrating at times when you are looking for a specific Item that you have missed in the area that you need to progress and it kind ruins the whole pacing of the game. It’s not necessarily a very fun game to play because the gameplay is very hit and miss and it’s not compelling in any way because it’s so simple but the story and characters pull you through until the end very easily.8/10 (Great)"

,Not Recommended,260230,33306269,Posted: 6 July,all,Tenderizer,"Ok, here's the issue I take with this game- The gameplay is designed to aid the story (And on a moment to moment basis, the gameplay is tedious)- The story is written purely for the sake of the ending (And on a moment to moment basis, the story is boring)- If the gameplay and story are all in service of the ending, what is the 90% before the end meant to beThe gameplay in this game is ok when it's the dodge the obstacles game, not great but not bad either, still fun. However, when it's the puzzles, the game is just insulting. These so called puzzles are so simple to solve, that they provide no sense of accomplishment nor challenge, they're just menial labour. What's worse, most of the puzzles involve a lot of walking, which is not fun. The gameplay for the most part is tedious, a detriment to the game and in some cases it would have been better to just have us walk from left to right.The story, is what many would consider the defining property of this game. I must concede, there are some good elements to the writing. It does take a less dialogue focussed approach and instead tends towards visual interaction, narration and world design which are far better approaches to game design (For further evidence, consider 'Thomas was Alone' and 'Nihilumbra'). It does however exhibit a very childish style in its core plotline, such that few events carry any weight and the tone is generally light. This is fine for the first hour, but after two or three, it's painful. After five it's really frustration, especially when I was expecting something sad. And that's where the ending comes in.The ending was sad, obviously, and it was an improvement over the previous writing. But it wasn't worth it. It isn't worth your time just to see this ending. The plotline and gameplay was consistently weak, despite great characterization and consideration for how video games are unique as a medium for story telling, (compared to the first titanfall, for example). I wanted to stop playing all the way from the half-way point, and I couldn't bring myself to play more than an hour at a time before that, let alone after.SPOILERS:The most noteworthy feature of the ending is the jarring tone shift, which was satisfying. The problem was, it happened far too late. The toneshift didn't make me appreciate the game more because I only had like 5 minutes of gameplay where the tone had changed. I don't see what I gain from that other than feeling the game was both incomplete and too long"

You play the role of multiple characters on their journey's to survive the horror they have been put into and to find and live for loved ones. The touching stories of all the characters are all intertwined together, and they help one another achieve their goals. I found great amusement in the gameplay, and I think that the puzzles that this game puts in front of you have a decent challenge and are creative, and very fun. The story is well put together, and also creative. It is also very moving, I became attached to the characters in the game as I played and made sure to help them with their goals.

The art is its own style, suited to an older era and very fitting for the time.  It can play out funny and cute moments, it can show gorgeous backdrops, but it will show you equal depths of wartime horror and despair.  The puzzles require enough thought to be intriguing and motivating while not going too far into frustration.  The 'taxi' parts are an excellent break from the normal routine, and I found the music accompanying them perfectly tuned.Above all, though, this is a memorial to the history and lives of those who were in the war, and the collectible items and in-game wiki provide an excellent reference for the events and often-brutal developments which came with them.  There is touching comradery and heartfelt emotion to be found, and I highly recommend it simply for the step back into history the game provides."

A world war one game that's not all about 'slaughtering Germans' or anything of the sort. Finally a game depicting the first World War as it truly was.The gameplay was enjoyable, puzzles that people from any age can enjoy and solve. Rythm sequences that could get rather hard (Or I just sucked at them), but overall very enjoyable, despite the short length of the game.However don't let that disappoint because the music and sound were absolutely amazing, every song from the intro to the credits was good, enjoyable and only made the story and the game that much more enjoyable.The story itself was, in my humble opinion, the best storyline ever in any game. It was touching, it could make anyones hair stand on end, and even make you cry. The way they picked the characters and made their stories intertwine, and show each aspect of the war, was well thought through, and even better executed. American, French, Belgian, British and German. Nurse or soldier. It showed the horror of each and every one of these individuals. I could not have asked for a better story to depict The Great War.Other then the story there is also tons and tons of information, both in form of background information to the current chapter in the game, or just in general more information about items used during the war, in form of collectibles. Truly amazing and interesting to anyone.Overall, this game was a true masterpiece made by Ubisoft and thanks to the help of organisations that, to this day, make sure that all those lost in the war, will never be forgotten. This game will make sure more people remember, and never forget the gruesome four years of war, and those who fought in it."
,Recommended,260230,12386782,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,Troll Under The Bridge,"Despite being about World War One, this game is actually not a shooter but a puzzle game. In fact, it has quite a lot in common with Telltale's The Walking Dead, up to and including a small sidekick to help with puzzles, and a serious downer ending.This game follows four characters from different backgrounds, and explores how their friendships are created or destroyed by the fire of the war. Truth be told, this game is one of the few I've played that actually made me come close to tearing up (although, as an Australian, I am physically unable to cry).If there's one thing that this game excels in, it's in creating atmosphere. The designers knew which visuals, effects and music choices can be combined to create certain feelings in the player, and so the story can transition from war-torn trenches to a calm countryside very smoothly. One scene near the opening was so effective in creating a fat-paced, terrified mood in me that I had to pause the game for a minute and make sure that I wasn't actually having a heart attack.If this game does falter in one respect, it's in how it sometimes overestimates the abilities of the player. Quite a few times within the game, I found myself thinking 'How the hell was I supposed to figure that out?', and one particular section sent me into ragequit mode multiple times. I swear, if I ever hear that music again...Overall, though, this is an amazing game. Buy it, and you won't ever be sorry."

I am not a fan of puzzle games, nor am I a fan of 2D games. Yet, this game made me enjoy these two aspects far more than many 3D open world games have made me enjoy theirs in the past year or two.The story is possibly one of the most well crafted in recent memory, with the game being able to create a set of standard characters that never speak a word of English, that bumble their way about the Western Front and somehow invest you in their well being and survival. The war, far from being a glorious crusade against the great evil, is a colossally barbaric bloodletting of innocent souls. The game can be as dark as the darkest images of war.But that is not to say there is no joy to be had in playing it. Escaping from the German Air force while the game blasts Hungarian Dance No.3 out of your speakers was hilariously good fun, and only got better when I was interoduced to the Can Can on the Champs-Élysées. There are many merry dances of various kinds in the game to match the depravity of the war.The puzzles are very well designed, although do occasionally seem rather unintuitive on rare occasions (about 3 times in the entire game). As the main meat of what you will be doing, they serve very well. They seemed difficult enough to require some thought, but not so difficult as to require a guide. They can be quite satisfying and enjoyable.Finally, there is the magnificent art style. As I say, I am not a fan of 2D games because of their tendency to go for bland retro or boring flash game styles, but this game goes in a different direction. It has moments where you will be running along and not even notice the subtle shifts in art direction as the game shifts tone until you're in the thick it, hiding from withering machine gun fire only to see that you are hiding behind a dead body, that you are standing in a river of blood and on a mountain of corpses. There will be times when starting out, that the world is rosy and colourful but by the end is bleak and bloody. There will be times when you will be behind enemy lines, running through fields at night, that the ground gets progressively darker until only the sky is a shade of dark blue and the ground is black and a flare flies up, lighting the way and the danger for only a moment. The art style is aware of it's ability and it uses that ability to the fullest extent that it can. The music only serves to amplify this.It made me feel strong emotions of happiness and sadness, of despair and joy. It is to be commended, it's rare that a game me feel anything strongly. It requires a great deal of skill to achieve such a feat and for that I can give it no less than my total recommendation as a must play."

76561198064969373,Recommended,260230,10880400,"Posted: 27 June, 2014",all,Reality,"Valiant Hearts is a powerful story about how four peoples' lives are affected by The Great War. It is so rare to see coverage of the First World War, and it is especially appropriate given that nearly 100 years ago, the war was started.First, some nuts-and-bolts: the game uses Uplay. I am sorry if this is a negative to you, but it is how it works. The game also have full controller support (at least for the XBox360 controller), which doesn't seem to be listed anywhere. The prompts are also in XBox360.The characters are all fairly likeable, omitting some spoilers. Emile, an older gentlemen pressed into service, is most certainly NOT a soldier at the beginning of the game - and it shows. Freddie seems to be the game's action hero, who is getting called into battle and ""saves the day"" for however long the war will let him. Anna is a nurse who seems to be able to solve any problem, no matter the cost. Karl is the unfortunate resident drafted by the German army, interrupting his family life. Finally, there is Walt, who you discover shortly into the game and will help you solve many puzzles - and loves to be petted!Freddie seems to be a little on the weak side out of the cast. His story makes sense, but the game doesn't go into much detail on the reasons he's in the war. A lot of the focus is (rightfully) given on Karl's problem, to make the war seem real. Anna and Emile definitely round out the main cast extremely well, and I definitely appreciated the little animations when Anna does her thing on the battlefield. Walt, the dog, is understandably thin on character. He's mostly there to drive the game along, because many puzzles require his use. He does get a moment or two very late in the game, however.Mechanically, the game is very fluid. I encountered no bugs nor crashes. ""War"" scenes play out similarly to a side-scroller, dodging machine gun fire and bombs/mortars. ""Puzzle"" scenes take place in a limited area, where you have to manipulate the environment using levers, wheels, platforms, or throw items to activate things. The ""war"" scenes definitely fit in with the plot, as the first few I was thinking ""Wow, this is war"" to ""Wow, this is horrible!"" along with the plot. There are a couple of ""Boss"" fights as well, with a villain created for the story. These scenes are timed and play out like a ""puzzle"" scene. Dying at any point in the game, whether on the field, to a boss, or failing a puzzle, just respawns you at the previous checkpoint. It does break immersion somewhat, however it minimizes the frustration, as you don't tend to respawn all that far from whatever killed you. The one thing that kept annoying me was having to hold the button to activate wheels and levers, and sometimes the wheel turning was a little slower than I anticipated.Graphically, the game is fantastic, looking much like a comic strip using UbiArt. You can see other soldiers racing into battle during the ""war"" scenes behind the main line and their untimely fates... Sometimes objects required for puzzles DO get hidden, like background objects, but there is always a way to solve the puzzle by experimenting. The music and the sound were also great, never taking away from the feel of the game.Difficulty-wise, the game isn't too hard. Death is resolved by the nearest checkpoint, and some puzzles do allow some room for error. Each character has different puzzle types, with Emile digging, Anna saving people, and Karl doing some trading. There are also a couple of scenes of your car dodging incoming (and oncoming!) obstacles. Anna's puzzles are mostly rhythm-based, and are pretty forgiving with their button prompts. It is unfortunate that your attention is at the top of the screen, rather than on the actions she's taking. A couple of puzzles were tricky, but like all good adventure games, you tend to go ""Ah, I should have though of that!"". Hints are available, 1 minute at a time, however I only had to use hints two or three times at all.There isn't that much replay, unfortunately. There are 100 collectibles to find throughout the chapters, but each collectible has a bit of a historical remark, such as soldier Dog Tags or Gas Masks. There are also some historical notes on events, such as POW Camps and important battles, along with links to MISSION CENTENAIRE 14-18 and Apocalypse: 10 Lives (both what I assume to be coverage of World War 1). The game does flow with the events of World War 1 for the most part, however it does not show the war's resolution (which is probably outside the scope of the game?). But I definitely got a sense of the impact of the war, even if it is only limited to the France-Germany border.Overall, the game is beautifully done and I WANTED to finish it and resolve the story. My playtime is about 6 hours for a first playthrough, without finding all the collectibles (maybe around 70% found). The message at the end is very powerful and shows, with great respect, the impact of the people of the war. It is a bittersweet game, where you will laugh at the silly stuff but MAYBE cry at the sad things (the ending was what really got me). I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this game."

Despite it's cartoonish look, it is beautiful to play, charming at it's best, yet still has a touch of serious tone to the toons and world surrounding them.Though I wasn't a hug fan of the direction the story took at times, I can not say it made it bad.  In fact the story was very thoughtful, and other times utterly heart breaking, it is well enough that I can say it would make an excellent movie let alone existing in a video game.We have expected in life to see few games based around The Great War of 1914-1918.  But being one of my favorite historical subjects I could not help but adore it while playing it.  It is colorful, charming, yet down right brilliant.  At times I smiled, I laughed and I cried.  Valiant Hearts easily belongs on the list of Great War games.The only thing I could possibily complain about the game was the controls.  But it wasn't enough to hurt the over all package, and I would recommend this game literally for anyone.  It is unique and far different from other war games.

And it has good music/ soundtrack and I like its art style a lot.Unfortunately, the game's gameplay ruins all that for me. There are a few nice moments and some interesting puzzle solving but the UI, most actions scenes (drive through falling bombs and mines!, run through bombs!, dig through planted and falling mines!, well they are terrible. They make the game frustrating and they disctract from whatever mood it was trying to set.There is also a particular mini-game for which you get zero turotial, works only with the arrow keys (so you are screwed if you were using WASD up to that point. This mini-game continues throughout the game at many occassions and of course it becomes harder and harder, and if it was no fun the first time, it's way worse later on.The game has collectibles. The info associated with those is nice. The way some of them are hidden and become challenges or part of puzzles is idiotic. I wanted to get them all, because I enjoyed the trivia, but that made me hit ""Space"" almost everywhere and destroyed all game's pacing.Furthermore, the game likes to kill you in unexpected ways, for you to ""learn"" what to do. I don't particularly like this design decision.Last, the story is ok-ish and has good moments but ultimately it is dissappointing. The game does something in the end that I am very opposed to, when I see games do it,, but it also pulls a lot of fake cliffhangers so much to the point that they become predicable and tiresome. In the end, this imaginary and imaginative story had better play out constistently either as a tragic story or a bed time story. It attempts to do both and in my opinion it fails when it tries to switch to ""serious"" mode for its finale.In the end, I would not recommend this game. It is great that this title exists, and is published by Ubisoft, but there are too many flaws to ignore, and the aftertaste the gameplat left to me was a bad one."

Although some historical facts could be seen as incorrect (the game offered the idea that the first World War started due to the assassination of the Franz Ferdinand, which caused German empire declare war on Russia. This is not entirely correct, as Austro Hungarian empire was the first that declared war on Serbia, which lead to a chain of countries declaring wars) but that is of small matter.I definetly recommend this game to anyone, who is looking for a game that offers a lot unfolding of historical events and a closer look to the lifestyle of soldiers in the WW1, a game that is simple and can make you stop and think for a second, or if you are just looking for a break from your average shooters, moba's, etc. Well done!"

This game isn't about being difficult or offering a challenge. The core of this game is story. Although I dabble in puzzle games like Limbo and Portal you can figure out a puzzle in around 15 minutes of just tinkering.When you hear about war and games you expect to be mowing down hordes of enemies or battling players online. The emotions of most war games are saved for trailers.This game is the tale of different characters from different locations around the world and even tangles with one of the characters being forced on to the opposing side. A civilain called to war. I don't know if this comes into play yet and we be a major part of the story. But I am looking forward to finding out what happens to everyone.Looking at the game at first glance you would think it was a game for children. But the stories of these characters are quite inspiring for people of all ages. It is some of the  stories that are lost at war everyday.

One could say that the puzzles which make up much of the gameplay aren't all that particularly difficult, and I wouldn't argue entirely against that, but then I never found myself bored with this game. A particular highlight in the gameplay was the once-per-chapter (with the exception of the more sombre final chapter) driving segments, in which the character(s) car would drive towards the screen, while the player steered left or right to dodge oncoming obstacles or enemy fire, all timed perfectly to fit musically with the choice classical pieces picked for those segments.I think my interest and investment within the setting, story, and characters are what really made this what it is.I couldn't recommend it highly enough."

It tells a story it wants to tell and does it without any bits of the story feeling unnecessary or drawn out. The gameplay is pretty diverse at first, mixing some action sequences with puzzle solving and even a rhythm game or two. But the game runs of out any new gameplay content about a third of the way through and spends most of the rest of the game retreading things it's already done, though it never felt too tedious and the puzzles and action scenes never get too challenging. There's also a lot of historical content provided and collectibles to find that give even more history, so you can get a good feel for the scenario through these as well as the actions of the story. The plot starts off a bit too silly, climaxing in a way-over-the-top sequence at the end of the second chapter, at which point the tone takes a darker turn and generally wears down the characters. There are some truly tense moments where I wasn't even sure if a character would live or die, and the ending is done very well, too. Not a flawless game, but a good experience and worth playing through."

If you do buy this game, which it is recommended you do, be prepared for some real sad moments, and probably one of the saddest endings to a game ever. This shows what most World War games lack, the decency of a good storyline. Also my play time is misleading, the game is about 8 hours of gameplay, I left my computer on by accident.

Shining light on the different situations from the different sides of the war, the game holds a very fast pace and drives a compelling and intensive story. There is little to say about the visual aspects of the game, because it is very obvious from the cover that the artstyle is inspired by various comic strips. Yet the love for detail makes this form of art design a breathtaking experience even for the most die hard 3D lovers out there. But what makes the experience even deeper is the music. It manages to deliver pressure, relief, joy, anger, hate and delight at almost all the right moments.Even though there have been issues with the controls at two points in the game, they were easily avoided with a simple rebinding of the keys.I had a hard time putting the game down and I did play through it within less than 24 hours.

I knew about the amazing art style, which is not surprising, since the game was made by UbiArt. I knew that it seemed to be story driven, but I didn't know anything about it, so I just took it as it was coming.Then I bought the game.What I got was more then I could've imagined. Way more.I got a game with an inpressive art style, even cooler then you could've told by the screenshots and trailers alone.I got a game with an amazing, touching story about 4 heroes of the war and how their paths crossed.I got a game with a high educational value, since everything in it is based on the actual World War I. That opens a whole new way of learning and you are actually willing to learn while playing this game.I got a game with surprisingly fun gameplay. The puzzles weren't too hard but fun and unique. There are also sequences in which you drive vehicles, fire cannons or use quick time events to heal fallen soldiers.I got a game that was never boring a single second during the 7 or 8 hours I spent playing through it.And if that's still not enough for you: There are more than 100 collectible items, which are not too easy to find sometimes ^^This is not a game about fighting in the war, it's about fighting against it!

But there are some imperfections to Valiant Hearts. This game is on the shorter end; it would be about 6 hours to someone who isn't stupid like me. The antagonist is a little outlandish and fantastical, but it is okay I suppose. But there, the bad ends. The puzzles are fun and they integrate historical terrors like flamethrowers, tanks, and chemical weapons as new, interesting mechanics. There are facts and even the collectables have intersting information to anyone who wants to know about the time. It is also cool that Ubisoft decided to release this game for the centenial, and being a French company, they naturally focused on the Western Front. I, as an American, rarely hear about WW1, as WW2 is our 'national war' for us, where we came out on top of the world (with the USSR). So to experience a French point of view on their national war is very interesting in and of itself. The game truly shines though, in the story, as we learn the terror, hope, and evil resulting from war. Many moments in this game gave me chills, and the art style even though a cartoon, still leaves a massive impression. If anything, I was in tears at the end of the game, and I have only done that for super tragic books and maybe the end of LOTR.Probably one of the best games I have played in a long time, if not, ever."

I actually ""found"" it again as i was playing ""This War of Mine"" - but thats another game and another review.So.VH begins with really lovely and fitting music, telling you the story of a Family (or ""lovers"" or how ever you wana call that now) which is thrown appart by the WW1.The CharactersYou mainly play 4 Characters wile the story holds on, without spoiler to much, i explain them shortly.Emile (I would call him the ""Frontman"" or ""Main character"")A French farmer, who begins to seach his Son-In-Law, Karl. He sadly had to go to war at the side from france.FreddieAn American volunteer fighting in the war to avenge his fallen wife whos also getting Emiles ""brother in arms"".AnnaA Belgian nurse searching for her father kidnapped by Baron Von Dorf, meeting Emile, Freddie & Walt later on the story.KarlA German, married to Emileʻs Daughter Marie and had to fight in the war for the german side.Walt! Mercy, mercy Walt...http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760024284As you might read, i also called the name Walt next to the 4 main characters. Walt is a dog, a doberman pinscher. He is kinda the ""side-kick"" next to each character and a very good one. along the way (with each character) he is there, somehow helping and working together with all the other characters, giving small hints and helping out at riddles.Gameplay & StoryThe story tells the destiny along those Characters, beginning with Karl who is forced to leave france and his mate Marie and had to fight for the german forces. Shortly after, Emile is also ""forced"" to join the forces of france to fight against the german army. Wile the story has twists and turns, it still is easy to follow since its nicely told, i would call it ""book-like"". Wile every Level is a part of the story, the story goes on with the game which fits perfectly and it gives nothing which is ""useless told"" somehow...well, nearly nothing.It gives 2 parts in the game which i, for myself, dont really like or where i thought the game tries now to make fun of itself.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760024413- the first part are the cardriving levels which are played after known musics. which means bombs and like drops in a rhythm of a special music which plays and you have to take care where it drops. those parts are actually not so bad but they anyhow dont fit into the game from my side at least (i mean i was sitting and listen to the music there wile playing those levels and was like ""are you kidding me now?""; they might tried to be funny here but...well...)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760024460- the other parts i didnt enjoy, mostly later on, are the Quicktime events. Im honest, I never ""HATED"" to play a nurse/medic in a game, which is in this game Anna. As the role of the nurse...let me call her FIELD-DOC (srs, it fits better), she has to make a ""minigame"" wile healing people. And what are those minigames? Youre right! Push the RIGHT BUTTON in the RIGHT MOMENT - in short Quicktime events. At the beginning, it might be easy but it quickly gets faster and harder. A Spoiler (ONLY READ IT IF YOU REALLY REALLY WANT!!!)The last level -IS- a Quicktime event level. its ♥♥♥♥ing long, its ♥♥♥♥ing fast and you really are in a rush. Srs, they could do it better...The Gameplay is a classic-like adventure but more in levels sections insteed a open-world like one.Get X to do Y with Z, open part A to go forward and playing with D character wile character F is waiting for item H - Just to keep it short.So you have a lot riddles to do and solve on the way. Even if this game is ""about"" war, you nearly never use a gun or like and if you do its very short and more minigame like. So is that game a action game? Sure not. Its a pur adventure game and a very nice one. The riddles and puzzles are not ""to hard"" and even if you need help, if you wait a bit, a soldier-dove (yea, you read it right...) gives you hints how you can solve the puzzles.Story like a book, playtime like a comicEven if it is a nice story and has a great OST, Graficstyle and co, the game is kinda short. For the normal price of 15€, the playtime is around 4-6 hours (maybe longer if you really want to collect everything).Conclusionhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761564883Valiant Hearts is a great Puzzle Adventure with a great story told like a good book. It might be a short game for the price tag but it sure is worth playing. It is not a action game even if its a ""War game"" and even if you have (sometimes) a weapon or like, its more a minigame using it. The actual minigames like a lot quicktime events might need practise to get ""better"" in those but i guess those are not to hard, like the riddles. The game plays pretty smooth, has a fitting soundtrack and a great storyteller and graficstyle.I can only recommend this game, mostly for people who like puzzle games or adventures with a very deep story."

,Recommended,260230,15142114,"Posted: 31 March, 2015",all,CyberusUK,"Valiant Hearts: The Great War Review.Introduction:Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a 2D adventure/puzzle game by Ubisoft. The game is inspired by letters written during the great war and follows four characters journey through the battlefield. Each character has there own unique reason for being involved, but their story’s soon become intertwined.Story:The story is well written and clever in the way it brings our heros together. As you progress through the game you will unlock journal entries explaining why things are happening or what things are. Andthese entries aren’t works of fiction ether, they are all based on fact. All through the game you will be unlocking more and more of these, until you have almost a text book if historical information on the great war. Now I covered World War 1 at school, so a lot of these weren’t that interesting to me. But I like the fact Ubisoft has tried to not only make a game but educate the user too, that’s not to say the user need educating but its there for them anyway.It seems a shame with Ubisoft taking this much time to get there facts correct, that they have chosen to use a completely fictions story. There are so many true stories that could have been just as heartfelt and at times tragic as this one, but maybe they were trying to avoid offending living relatives. I’m unsure of there motives, but feel the game suffers a little for this and that a true story would have inspired real emotion from the player.Gameplay:The controls are a fairly simple affair using the WASD and a few other buttons when needed. But as the game has no real twitch elements you never find yourself overwhelmed or out of your depth. There is the odd in mini game that requires timing, but its nothing too taxing and check points are mercifully regular if you do get it wrong.You will spend much of the game going back and forward, slowly progressing as you solve puzzles. The puzzles aren’t that taxing ether, normally requiring you to find a key or gear for a bell tower. Its generally pretty clear what you have to do and that is the games biggest downfall, the puzzles are so liner that the challenge is somewhat lost.That’s not to say its bad, but it does get a little monotonous running back and forth for the fifth time, or finding the handle for a leaver the tenth time.Presentation:The game has a pleasant style, with the art resembling that of Castle Crashers. The down side being that where Castle Crashers sprites are bright and colorful, these are a far more dull affair with grey and greens being the order of the day. Of course this fits far better with the theme of the great war, but can be a little bland.The animation is good but basic, these 2D characters don’t have a massive array of movement at their disposal. But to be fair they don’t require it and what they do have is great. There’s nothing to blow you away here, but there’s nothing to hate ether. In fact I enjoyed the style very much.Conclusion:It may sound like I hate this game, but I really don’t. I like the game, but I don’t love it. I feel Ubisoft has taken a very hard subject and tried to make something not only touching but educational as well, in this goal I think they have only partially succeeded. Those who could probably do with learning from this game will most likely not bother reading the facts given, and those who have some knowledge will find them an annoyance. It really is a valiant effort by Ubisoft and the game is good, but I very much doubt you will want to play it for much more than an afternoon.For more of my reviews seeCyberus UK"

Oftentimes I would die due to moving just an inch too close to some gas or I'd poke my head out to a hail of bullets (when two minutes prior I was able to run right through the gunfire). It's a short 5 hour game, yet it still managed to drag on, leaving me wondering on several occasions when it would finally end.If you can deal with the mindnumbingly dull gameplay, then there's a good chance you'll enjoy the story.

76561198057483405,Not Recommended,260230,19708499,"Posted: 15 December, 2015",all,ScrapGenus,"This game is terribly dull - not a single puzzle can be considered fun and some like the button QTEs are overly simplistic and annoying. The puzzles are very, very brainless, consisting of mostly QTEs, fetch quests, and reaction puzzles. Any puzzle you are unable to solve is probably due to bad game design; for instance, there was one puzzle in Chapter 3 where you needed to create a diamond shaped object, I handed in a square and was denied, and only the diamond is accepted. The characters' individual 'powers' make little sense, because apparently only the old grandpa with the big ladle can dig through mud but the muscular soldier cannot pick up a shovel and do the same, or why does one character has a pair of pliers that never breaks while all the others can only pick up one use pliers to force the problems unto the player instead of presenting interesting puzzles. This necessity for detailed solutions shows how lack of attention to details game designers gave it. Thankfully the game is very forgiving with checkpoints, and frequent deaths due to unfair situations can be forgiven. Simple and forgiving however, makes a good game for children.The collectibles contribute absolutely nothing to the story, and I feel they are just added to pretend that there is a replay element when there really is not. If you need a game that has a lot of padding to distract your children, tell them they have to collect all the collectibles and remember some of the factoids to get a present. Sometimes, these trinkets you collect are immersion breaking too - why would you bend down and collect a small trinket amidst gunfire, or running to save someone crying for help? For a 'completionist' run one would have to ignore all logic in situation and try to search for places that these meaningless items are hidden, why such an option is added is puzzling. All it is, I think, is useless padding to make the game seem longer.The story, love it or hate it, is completely devastated by poor game design. Emotions sessions are padded with boring puzzles that breaks up continuity, and doing the same old chores simply makes one feel frustrated, but not frustrated in the way the story wants you to feel. Bugs and the distraction of collectibles aside, the lack of attention to scenes, characters and puzzle design is especially disruptive to immersion because that makes up the bulk of the game. There is a part where your character is supposed to pick up the pliers from the floor at the midst of battle, if you press the action button but miss the sweet-spot you have to stand on to prompt the action, your character will scratch his chin and think - all in the midst of heavy gunfire - like he does during other puzzling moments. Why was this overlooked? How could this have been overlooked? This constant immersion breaking experience is probably the worst sin this game has committed. I tried killing the dog, throwing grenade at people, but the world seems to ignore it and never had I gotten a gameover screen other than getting the character you control killed. You can't kill anything in this game. Drive the tank in chapter 3 and do the logical thing and fire the cannon at the German soldiers - guess what - nothing happens. Good games send anti-war messages by forcing the player to make painful decisions that would not have been necessary if it was not because of war, and make players regret the decisions they make, make them feel pain for the people they killed and the buildings they destroyed. Turning everyone invincible to the devastating elements of war and battle, or making the characters unable to pick up weapons and gun down enemies to save their own lives when it makes perfect sense to do so, is not the way to deliver the message.The narrative in this game is so atrocious that the game feels like an afterthought than an integral part of the plot. It seems like the developers were thinking, how do we make this game an arbitrary length long so that it can justify the price tag, instead of thinking of how the game-play can help to complement the story. There is so much wrong with the narrative that I don't think the game should have been made in the first place. It was a very disturbing experience for me, but probably not in the way the developers wanted. I wrote this review concurrently while playing the game, not because I wanted to write a review, but I felt the need for a rant every time the game breaks me out of the immersion. As for the story, I think it is good, the message is good, but it is honestly nothing exceptional and I would have rewritten some parts of the ending just to knit together some game-play elements and the story to better create that devastating sensation felt from the quote uttered at the end ""War makes men mad"". The game has a message, but it is as though the developers did not understand that message themselves at all. Chapter 4 is probably the best chapter, but the whole game could have been condensed into a much shorter experience to make Chapter 4 feel more impactful - because a bored man can't feel any other emotions, he just feels bored.I applaud the team for trying to do a non-FPS war game, but as the game stands now it should have just been at most a graphic novel and not a stealth-puzzle game. The puzzle style can work, because there are parts where the interactive elements of the game actually contributes to the narrative, such as the final battle in Chapter 4. Having a good plot is important, but having little to no game-play elements to support that plot almost makes this title a non-game. The experience feels toned down and censored, prepared for mass consumption but cannot be considered a breakthrough because of the extremely poor narrative. Valiant effort, but still not enough effort."

Most people seem to praise this game for his great story and creativity, which i agree in a certain way.Before reviewing this game i just wanna thank the developer and ubisoft for trying something different, this isnt the game  that they got right but it might set the path for a greater one.Lets start with the graphics, which is , in my opinion the best part . Games these days try to make everything very realistic and that might look good on release but years after it will already be very dated. Meanwhile ,games with a less serious art style like the wind waker (that already has 14 years) will never get old with time, the same happens with valiant hearts with a very cartoony style. Unfortunaly with such a cartoony style, the story will probably get taken less seriously , i dont know if this was the developers intention, but i dont believe it was the right choice with a game that is so much story driven.Sadly, that and the history facts were the only interesting parts for me.The worst part about this game were definitly the puzzles they werent just bad, they were very repitive. Valiant Hearts includes, for the most part, puzzles that you have to try one more time, which is always a big turnoff for me. Who doesnt feel great completing a puzzle on the first try?You will not find that in this game.Being so repetitive ,I wish this game was shorter ,there are some unnecessary parts that could have been easily skipped.Finally the story, nothing special but it wasnt that bad either.The ending was good but predictable.Do i recommend this game?No, by any means. I really like history and yet, i still cant recommend this game to anyone. Very repetitive even for a 6 hour long game. 5/10"

It is a truly special title that not only succeeds as a great game; but provides a deep insight into the historical events of 1914-18 which educates and informs the user in an engaging way.Your journey sees you undertaking the role of four playable characters; Emile, Freddie, Anna and Karl - each with their own story that intertwines into an absorbing tale. They are also accompanied by a faithful companion; Walt, who is a dog that helps along the way. The superb writing really makes you care about the characters and their experiences.Valiant Hearts's stand-out gameplay aspect is puzzles - most of which are fairly basic but are all varied and great fun to complete. Despite the simplicity of many; they are superbly orchestrated. The general mechanics are easy to pick up and the controls are simple which make the experience a joy throughout. There are a wealth of collectables and achievements that ensure you explore every nook and cranny of each location plus many historical prompts which offer a deep insight into the real events of the war away from the game. These also contain real pictures and intriguing information that brings the colourful aspects of the game into a harsh reality of the tragedy.Overall, Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a wonderfully presented product with a powerful story, excellent gameplay mechanics and impeccable visuals.

But it got more and more childish, and the puzzles became these chores with the sole purpose of moving the story forward.  They became more and more silly, usless, and ridiculous as the story goes on. It felt like they did that to only lengthen the time required to finish the game.The game is also subject to glitches and bugs, getting stuck, death, etc.As a concept, this game is pretty good, but when applied it's not as great as it could have been.Consider this as a children's game 9+, it's still playable but not really as breathtaking as the positive reviews make it.I honestly wonder the type of people that have loved this game so much.The only thing that I can say is consistently of good value, is the side aspect of the pacifist ideal in the game. You cannot kill anyone, you may only knock them out.I tried to delay deciding about this game for later, since there are so many positive views. But I haven't changed my mind, this game genuinely isn't as brilliant as they claim it to be.I won't go into the long rants of the wide range of problems both technical and plot design, like going to save your friend by rushing to the enemy camp and getting first aid kit, but it takes you this... ridiculous long journey through the camp, with all these ups and downs, and you keep going deeper and deeper into the enemy base to get a first aid kit. By the time you're back, your friend will be dead, that is if you survive the ridiculous journey. Characters move back and forth across the frontline like they're trailing through the woods. The game gets pretty dark at times for such a silly game, and then you face this silly, perfect antagonization of a German commander, cause you know.. Germans are the ultimate evil, they caused both World Wars (not exactly). And oh my god the glitches. I admit there were cute moments, but they got less frequent as the game continued and you will have to tolerate more and more terrible plot writing, accompanied by equally ridiculous gameplay.Play the game if you have the time and money to waste, that is if you either have the low enough standards to enjoy such a thing, or your life is occupied by nothing else to do that is more fullfilling or valuable. But if value both, your money and time, and expect something of worth in return, then don't consider this game."

You don't really get a sense of the world as you get frustrated trying to figure out where to throw a stick of dynamite or rock in the 3-4 different rooms. The factoids thrown in at each level are the only thing really related to the great war.The very beginning and very last mission are the only strong points that make you actually care about the characters and what's going on. Everything in between is just puzzles and weak dialogue-- there is no spoken dialogue as the characters only commuicate with pictures and pointing."

I can in no way recommend this game and I'm honestly both digusted and ashamed that I purchased it.But let me clarify. If this were just a fun little adventure/puzzle game I'd have really truly enjoyed it. The choreographed chase scenes set to classical music, the fun puzzles jumping between characters with the dog is great. I had a wonderful time.That is, until I continually found one of the ""over 100"" collectables that are littered throughout the game. Each one complete with its own factoid about the Great War and the people who lived through it. Just finish an exhilerating chase through occupied France to the tune of (I think) Farandole? Great! Did you know Canadian soldiers plastered urine soaked rags onto their faces to avoid having their insides chemically burned by German gas? I do now!Don't get me wrong, I finished it. I enjoyed every moment of the gameplay. What got me was how little the narrative they were trying to present actually meshed with any of what they presented in any other aspect. Without spoiling anything, Ubisoft has managed to push some of the most atrocious war crimes into a cartoony game with a cartoony feel but slam you with heavy handed messages of reality and rememberance every chance they get. Even the ending is overly dramatic, Spielbergian, heart-string pulling, mess. Even more egregious than the achievements that pop up periodically informing you of your accomplishments throughout one of the most horrific events in human history, Ubisoft decided to hamfistedly pull you into feeling regret and sorrow before rolling the credits over the somber piano score.And then cut back to another primary character, hinting that there WILL be DLC because the game ends before the war actually finishes. So what is this, Ubi? An art game with a message or a cash grab? Is it just coincidence that this came out basically during E3 so it got little attention? What about the fact that this is the 100 year anniversary of the start of the war?The crassness and plain obvious nature of this alone is upsetting. And that's before the dissonant chord struck by the gameplay and hackneyed narrative. Character development is next to nil in a game focused on four potentially strong primary characters and their own arcs really only move forward when you take yourself out of the game, navigate a menu, open their diaries and wrestle the controls to allow you to read them in the correct order.For the record, I'm the kinda guy who likes Louis C.K. and relishes in lowbrow humor.

Intended to illustrate the horror and heroism of the war, the player never gets to shoot a single enemy soldier with a gun throughout the course of the game. Instead, the player takes the role of four characters – an American intent on avenging the death of his fiancé, a German soldier intent on getting home to France, the German’s French father-in-law, and a Belgian combat medic. While the American’s story is a component of the campaign, in reality it primarily focuses on the French family and the Belgian combat medic’s work to keep them safe.As an adventure game, the game relies heavily on “puzzles”, but in reality, the puzzles are almost all of the variety of “find item A and bring it to spot B”. There are very few real puzzles, and the few “true” puzzles you find over the course of the game feel out of place in the world of World War I – who would write hints to a safe code on a window that points to letters on a German battle flag? It just doesn’t make sense.As a result, the game isn’t really much of a “game” at all – rather, it is more of an interactive work of historical fiction with various puzzles thrown in to… make it feel more gamey, I guess? There are a few more traditionally video-game-like sequences, such as navigating through artillery barrages and dodging tanks and barriers in a racing car, as well as the healing minigame which is just “press the right buttons in sequence” (AKA a quick-time event of sorts), but while these sequences are at times fun, at other times they feel somewhat tedious – while the taxi sequences were reasonably challenging, the “dodge the artillery barrage and machine gun fire” sequences, when done too much in one level, began to feel fairly samey. While they did create some tension, it wasn’t really fun gameplay, as it was mostly just waiting for stuff to open up so you could progress, and “stay out of the bad”. Likewise, the collection minigame – which opened up bits of lore for you to read about – was mostly just tedious and “spot the object lying on the ground” (or, more often, just press A everywhere as you move around to make sure you don’t accidentally run past something).The game does do its job reasonably well – you do want everyone to live and get back to their families (other than the American, who I never really connected with emotionally, and whose story felt kind of disconnected from the rest of the game), but it is fairly transparent in its tugging of the heartstrings. The flavor of the world is pretty good, though, and the animation throughout the game is decent enough in its simplistic nature, making you feel sorry for a few characters who have unique models only to kill several of them off.Unfortunately, when the game isn’t at its best, it can be kind of confusing. An aviator named George is introduced for a single part of a single mission, calling in artillery shots, and he seemed to have no real relevance to the rest of the game – why is he named George? What is his significance? It stuck out to me as being very random. Likewise, Baron Von Dorf, the villain that the American spends most of the game pursuing, feels cartoonishly out of place – while his boss battles are okay gameplay wise, they feel very strange in the context of an otherwise realistic game about the horrors of World War I.Consequently, the game is far from perfect. As a game, it isn’t that great, and as a story, while it can be strong, it can also have sections that just feel kind of there. Overall, the experience was decent enough, and the game isn’t overly long, but there’s not a whole lot of substance – World War I sucked, everyone knows it sucked, and I’m not sure that this game really had a whole lot to add to that message. There is emotional resonance, though, and you do feel sorry for the family torn apart by the war, so it isn’t a total failure in terms of impact – but in the end, I feel like I would have rather watched a movie about the same subject matter."

Effective, probably, for gently engaging and introducing an infant to the subject and history of WW1. Don't expect anything special if you're getting this for yourself, especially if you're even slightly versed on the subject of the War. In fact, the more of a history buff you are, the less you'll wind up enjoying the game. Good chance you'll hate it. From a mature adult perspective, much of the game is in horrendous taste.As for the content and gameplay, some parts are polished with solid direction, conveyance, and quality control. Other aspects feel unfinished and detract from the overall immersion and narrative. Awkward design choices abound at the worst possible times. None of the puzzles are especially challenging, which is fine, but some come across as cheap or forced and will draw you out of the game at their silliness. Historical wiki snippets, collectibles, and diary entries accessed during core-gamplay are additional distractions that, though well intentioned, kill the immersion. By the end we found ourselves pretty removed from the experience, uninpressed with the predictable Hollywood conclusion, and happy to be done the game with no desire to ever play it again. It didn't deliver even a fraction of the feels one would expect prior to playing it if you've seen the trailer.It's a nice game for giving people a general history lesson about WWI but the cartoonishness extends beyond the visual design and into aspects of the gameplay and plot. Arcade and rhythm action sequences are out of place and non-sensical.

Its approach to war is comical and melodramatic. The villain is a walking cliche, complete with an evil laugh. The characters are flat and uninteresting (I felt as though I was controlling a lunky robot). The story is predictable and frankly made me feel nothing.Then, does the gameplay redeem it? No. It's a tedious back and forth, running from point A to point B to deliver an obvious solution to an obvious puzzle. It's like playing an educational children's game. In addition to this. graphically, the puzzles were convoluted, ridiculous, and out of place. Rearranging Goldberg-like pipes to redirect chlorine gas is not exactly being faithful to the content they are portraying. If the puzzles had been taken more seriously, the atmosphere would not have been as weak as it was.This game is trying so hard to show what can happen to ordinary people when a war hits, while simultaneously creating characters that accomplish incredible feats and cheat death countless times. I felt invincible as I played these characters. I didn't even have to kill anyone directly. This game filtered every bit of brutality and turned it into a silly minigame.It had its moments, though. Sometimes, you actually do get to see the human side of ""the enemy,"" but not as much as I would have liked to. Sometimes you do encounter death and destruction, but when you do, it's comical and Hollywood-like.

My gripes stem from the fact that I found the narrative of the game to be one of its weakest aspects and some facets of the game to be a farcical deviation from the true nature of war, the exploration of which is something that this game advertises and uses to sell itself.  I find the narrative especially disappointing considering the intensity of the hype surrounding this game's narrative from critics and users alike.First, the fictitious aspects of the narrative that focus on the in-game characters suffer from some of the developer's design choices.  Throughout the game, characters speak in muted volumes and the player isn't really privy to their speech and attitudes first-hand.  This left me feeling like the characters themselves lack personality and are simply cardboard cut-outs onto which the narrator pastes a story.  Nearly all of the character development in this game, something that I thought would be its strong-suit, is handled by the omniscient narrator, rather than the characters themselves. Again, this design choice leaves the characters a little bland, in my opinion.To make the rather bland character development worse, I find it extremely disappointing how much content there is in this game that serves to remove the player from immersion.  The bosses and puzzles in the game are the two of the worst offenders (see comments on silliness below).  However, there are many others and by the time I got to the end of this game I was rather less invested in the story and characters than I thought I would be and I found myself fairly blase about their fate.What I found most disappointing, however, was how the little bit of drama to be had in the story is ruined by the total silliness of much of the game.  I was led to believe by nearly every article, interview, etc surrounding this game that it would be an honest look at the drama of WWI, the game's cartoonish art notwithstanding.  Instead, the developers seemed to take many opportunities to undermine the seriousness of the subject they're covering.  The shock and drama of families torn apart by war, death, and destruction is completely neutralized by Snidley Whiplash-esque villains, ridiculously out-of-place Rube Goldberg machines/puzzles in the middle of the gaming world, asininely stupid NPC's, main characters as soldiers that run around the front-lines of WWI w/ soup ladles and bare fists rather than rifles or pistols, and a hundred other silly breaks from the reality of the events of WWI.  It isn't the fact that this game isn't 100% true to reality that bothers me; it's the fact that instead of adding to the drama of the story, many parts of the game detract from the drama b/c of their silliness.All of this is capped by an ending that I won't spoil for anyone reading this, but I will content myself with saying that it is not true to the horror of WWI, as the scenario is presented in the game.

Just because I respect where this game is coming from, doesn't mean I'm obligated to say this game is good.TL;DR:Here's my argument in a nutshell: Yes, the game has good presentation. However, why should I be emotionally invested in the game's characters, when what we know about them as people (i.e. their personality) is about the same as nearly every other soldier in the war? Also, the story just comes off as plot convenience and deus ex machina. The game play can be exciting and tense, but also nonsensical.Anybody reading this who liked this game, calm down! Stop foaming at the mouth. I'm not heartless, I understand what the game was trying to do. I'm not outright condemning this game, it has its positives. Let me start with the synopsis first.Valiant Hearts is a game about World War I, and it follows 4 people (technically 5, but she hardly makes an impact on the story other than a motivation for two other characters) and their intertwining stories.The story follows Emile, father-in-law to Karl, who are both drafted into the war, leaving behind Karl's wife and child. Since Emile is French and Karl is German, they enter the war on opposing sides. Emile wants to find Karl and both he and Karl want to reunite with Emile's daughter and grandson. Emile becomes friends with Freddie, an American who volunteers for the French army for revenge. Lastly, there is Anna, a Belgian studying in Paris, who joins the war as a doctor/nurse and literally collides with Emile and Freddie in a chance encounter. She, like Emile, is looking for someone. They join forces and endure the war together, although they are often separated.Oh, and how could I forget the adorable dog who is of great assistance for the characters throughout the game?Its biggest strength is the presentation: the music always appropriate for the scene, the art style is interesting, the narration and voiceover always keeps the narrative at a consistent pace, the emphasis on putting the story in a detailed historical context. The graphics are pseudo-3D, and comic book-ish, which, in my opinion, gives the setting more character than if it was realistic 3D. The soundtrack is exciting and bombastic, lively and cheerful, somber and solemn, in the right places. It features some famous themes that further contributed to my enjoyment of the game (Night on Bald Mountain FTW). Both add significantly to the story's atomsphere and mood.Its biggest negative, however, is the one thing that it was trying emphasize: the story and characters.""HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT! THAT WAS ITS BIGGEST STRENGTH!"" you might be yelling at me. But think about it: what do we know about the characters? Other than a shallow background, nothing. The diary entries don't add anything that ever other soldier is feeling. The only emotional investment I had in these characters was via the hardships they faced, but all the other soldiers faced similar hardships, so why should I care about the characters' hardships?Take Karl for example: he's a German who married and settled down with a French woman and lived with them and her father on a farm. Ok, what do we know about him as a person other than he's a loving father and husband? ......Sounds pretty generic. What about how he and Marie met, why they fell in love? His relationship with Emile, the father-in-law? Did we really learn anything about his personality?What about Emile? Why does he live on the farm and not the city? What kind of relationship does he have with Marie and Karl? It would have helped if there were full cutscenes with complete voice acting, not the occasional voiceover. More backstory, please.Freddie and Anna had a bit more personality, to the game's credit. She drove a taxi (the whole factoid about the taxis was interesting) to the front, she feels compelled to help any wounded soldier, no matter who it was. While cliche, it's at least commendable. Although, I would like to have known her relationship with the father, the governess.Freddie: I'd say it's interesting that he went overseas to do something that was so frowned upon in America, it was practically illegal: interracial marriage. However, this is the same as Karl: what relationship did Freddie have with his wife?Honestly, the most memorable character in the game is Walt the dog.Nothing much to say about the story other than: I would've accepted it if it was a true story. But it isn't, so the fact that the characters' paths conveniently crossed so many times that the plot came off to me as contrived.The gameplay is basic puzzle solving mixed in with fetch quests, QTE's, stealth sections, vehicle dodging sections, and a couple tank shooter sections. One important game mechanic is precise throwing, where you have to throw various objects in arched trajectory in order to progress. Rudimentary stuff, but it is excusable, since it's clear that the game is emphasizing its story more than anything else. Honestly, some of the game mechanics do make for some tense/exciting moments. The puzzle solving / fetch quests allows for the exploration of the setting and the historical context of the game, including major battles and soldiers' living conditions at the war front. I would recommend taking the occasional break and reading the historical facts and collectibles as they come along. However, this game sometimes defies logic and common sense, and wants you to solve a puzzle in a specific way, though I might see a more sensible way of solving it. In the stealth and dodging sections, there are parts where I had to suspend disbelief at the fact soldiers in some parts of the game couldn't see me, though a real person would have. To name some examples, Emile had control of an artillery shell cannon in one part, but he could have shot down the Baron's blimp instead of the house. Another example: am I supposed to believe Karl knocked down those golden apples, and the soldiers didn't think to look up? Or that he was able to get past a couple of soldiers with a scarecrow? What, they didn't notice that it moved every time they flashed their lights on it?I wanted to like this game, I really wanted to, for its premise and its presentation, but it shot itself in the foot with everything else (story, character, gameplay)."

It uses the Uplay program which to me is a negative. When I buy something on Steam, I would like it to be compatable with Steam and not use another program, which I am forced to download (Not counting MMO Launchers, etc.).This game is about several characters, who must survive the tripulations of the Great War (WW1) and to do so, must solve different puzzles to advance through each stage. Each stage is also filled with facts about the Great War and little knick-nacks to find throughout the stages. There is also a section of brief diaries that you unlock throughout the game, but give no great insight into the game.The story is predictable and has the same Hollywood Ending that you would come to expect. The characters are archtypes, with little influence on how they are unique. They are standard good-guys & gals in any video game sense and carry the same archtypes as you would think of their character models.The puzzles are less than challenging, even without the hintbook which the game offers, you simply need to run around the stage for a few minutes to figure out the simple puzzles. The hardest part of the game comes with digging, not to spoil a part of the game, but it is infuriating rather than challenging. There are some sequences where timing is of the essence, but all that requires is a good eye on what is happening, with the objective plainly in sight.The artwork is pleasant to look at, with the preference to the details of the enviroment and to the sounds that you can hear in the story. It has a cute and tone heavy artstyle, but little deviance from a PG-13 flick (Ex: You are in a trench, there will be no organs , just dead bodies around and lots of mud). Characters also speak four different languages: English, French, German and Canine.Overall, this game is something that you can play if you have some spare money and a bit of free time in your hand. Do not expect it to be the next great game on your list however and it is certainly not worth the 14.99$ tag on it's packaging. If you do wish to buy it, I would wait for a sale on the game.

It is not buggy or something like this.Valiant Hearts is just boring. Now some people could insult me as ignorant but read my other reviews then you will see that I actually pretty much like stories.The topic is great. A topic for the whole world, the WWI. But this game doesn't really shows you the horror of war.There is no blood, no rifles to shoot, no screams. That sounds like I only like games that are brutal but that's wrong again. I just think that you need some brutality to show the cruelness of war.Moreover, the ""puzzles"" are as easy as they were made for 12-year-old gamers.Since the gameplay is boring and not fitting to the topic the story could be interesting, right? Yes. Nevertheless the story is just as boring as the gameplay.Some people here say the story is sad and catching. It's not. I can not describe it, it is simply not catching or sad or whatever.Maybe I don't feel with the characters because they don't speak but rather use sounds to communicate which is again a point that appears in games for younger people.The only thing which is sad and touching is the end, but I don't like playing 7 hours for just one great moment.In conclusion, Valiant Hearts is a boring game.

I really have been enjoying this game and really wish to continue playing it, but since this is a horrific game breaking bug I must rate poorly on this game.

,Not Recommended,260230,13092117,"Posted: 26 November, 2014",all,CombustibleLemons,"Now I tried to play this game and at first I liked it somewhat. It had nice narrative and some of the puzles were fun. But over time it began to grow old. The puzzles are nice and somewhat clever at times, though once you finish a puzzle you are going to see it again multiple times almost 100% of the time.Towards the end of the game the puzzles begin to get replaced by some very annoying and boring running sections where  you need to run and avoid falling bombs or take cover when German machine gunners pop out. That is another thing, the only weapons I saw the enemies(both Germans and others) use were machine guns and bombs, or in the case of ""Villan Von Evil""- im sorry Baron von Dorf, giant steampunk blimbs and tanks. There was one point when you needed to dodge grenades and grab the one unprimed and toss it back into Dorf's bimb engines, but that was rahter bland.The characters are also quite bland even if they are based on real people. You have the morally right grandfather who wants to go back to his daughter and grandson, Emile. The big American who wants revenge on Dorf for something that I have forgoten due to reduncancy to plot, Freddie. the nice medic girl who wants to save her father from Dorf's clutches, Anna, and the nice German boy who is the son in law of Emile, Kurt. Freddie's and Anna's stories could be left behind, and Kurts was nice but bland. Emilie's was interesting for most of the game but began to drag on as it never really tried anything special. There was a point in the game, somewhere before mid point I think, where hey showed a cutscene whihc if you pay attention to, you can alrady tell how the ""story""(I would rather not call it a game) will end.I hate to use this word so often, but the graphics are also very bland. I figure it was meant that way to stimulate the desparity of the trenches(which you are in for about maybe 45 minutes max if you dont get stuck on every puzzle), but even with that it is still too bland. Watching the game's graphics makes me feel bored and I want to stop playing the game, I had to force myself to get through most of the game.As for the story itself, I feel it would be removed entirly and nothing would change. You could even remove the chracters and replace them with soldier A,B and C and Medic A and nothing would change. I didn't really begin to care, much less like any of the characters at all. The game might have been better if they removed all but one of the characters, that way you could have less characters to not care about. There were a few scenes that were suppose to be sad, but I didn't really feel that at all. It left like seeing those ""cute"" cat images on the internet, the game was scream ""HEY LOOK! IM SAD AND DEPRESSING! CRY AT ME!"" so hard that it made me sick.The narrative was nice, though it rarly ever came in to tell me what was really going on. The story teller would jump in, explain what everyone is trying to do and then never reappear until the next chapter(4 chapters in total).As another reviewer here stated, the puzzles feel out of place, and frankly kinda disrespectful towards the war and the victims of it. The game feels like an action adventure game with the battlefields as a backdrop. It tries, but never really manages to show how grand and horrific a war it was.Let's not even mention U-Play..."

I just completed chapter 1 so I have not beat the game, but it is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  Many of the reviews that came out for the game depict it as lacking in storytelling, gameplay, and overall emotion. I can say without a doubt that it is not true. The story is compelling right from the first few minutes, and even though it is heavy at times, it manages to maintain a light mood that keeps it from getting too depressing. It is a brave thing to have made a game about WWI, and I think they have created a fantastic story overall. The gameplay is going to be lacking if you compare it to modern day shooters or war strategies, but that is the entire point. The gameplay is the way in which you interact with the story and characters within the world. It is there to add to your experience, and though it is not particularly challenging, you still feel rewarded when you solve the story driven puzzles.  Overall I would recommend the game to anyone looking to play a game with a more artistic design and that want to experience a story, rather than play a game. My only con is that the diary entries are hidden in the pause menu with very little indication they are there, but they are very crucial to understanding the characters as they progress through the game so I highly recommend reading them."

I really enjoyed the story, the great art and music, along with the additional historical content. In fact I would like to have seen more historical elements, such as the pictures- along with the real world facts surrounding the war. Though the art was ""comic-book"" like the real historical pictures and elements really added a gravitas to the game/story.The gameplay itself was well put together, if not overly difficult. Again the gameplay is more to propell the story forward and let the player ""interact"".  The mechanics all worked as intended so there are no complaints there. If I had any complaints about the game play itself it would be that the puzzles were harder, with more variety.As I got it on sale the price was fair- however I was able to complete the game at about 90% items found in 7.2 hrs. For only 7 hours of gameplay many customers may not feel the $15.00 price is fair. That and I don't see any replay value in it.

Why can't video games be more Moving and Exciting that also has a unique meaning to it? The ending was so powerful.This game is very well accurate to the Battle of Verdun and Somme. They even provide facts for you to learn as well throughout the whole game.

I didn't mind because I already had Uplay for farcry. But, if you really hate Uplay, you're SOL, and this game is too short. I would love it to atleast have co op.If you're going to beat it in 1 sitting it would probably take 5-6 hours depending on if you're looking for the artifacts in the game.- Art is stunning- Uplay is a waste of time- This game shows historical evidence and also allows them to provide the dev's own story in it- Each character is unique- Animals of war are more presented as soldiers than an animal which most WW1 books lack- Too shortOverall this game kicked♥♥♥♥♥ It has cartoony art, but its still an emotional journey.Ending made my heart shallow~~~~"

However gameplay is not why you should get this game, the true value of Valiant Hearts is in the masterful storytelling and comprehensive history.  While dialogue is barely distinguishable it is hardly necessary with how well the game designers set up each scene and emote with the game characters, the best modern comparison for this is Wall-e.  For the packrat and sharp eyed players the game is filled with collectibles that can be challenge to find and each one provides a mini history lesson.  I would not say Valiant Hearts has challenging gameplay, though finding 100% of the items through out the game is a challenge, but I cannot recommend this game enough.  Ubisoft has taken all of the anger and desperation and stupidity and courage and fear and horror and valor that came out of what was called The Great War.  Simply put Valiant Hearts has some of the best visual storytelling I have seen in a game in years and you are doing yourself a disservice by not experiencing it."

Diaries and information about different aspects of WWI taught me quite a lot, and it's disturbing to think that 100 year old bombs are still at risk to hurt people.This game uses a lot of point-and-click-type puzzles, some of which are very annoying. Some of the puzzles also include waiting, which doesn't feel very satisfying to complete. The story is still quite excellent, though the characters could definitely be a bit more polished. The ending makes it sound like there's going to be a sequel, or a similar game based on WWII, but this game also feels like it could use a bit more polish and time.As of this writing, it's $15 on Steam, which I feel is currently slightly high of a price for a ~6 hour game that has some cheap time extenders to it.

76561198012478081,Recommended,260230,10858533,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,Alatriste,"What can I say?Story: The story revolves around four different characters who have been engulfed by the killing machine that was the First World War and their canine companion. It starts when Karl, Marie's husband is exiled from France and drafted to the german army. Emile, Marie's father is also drafted to the army. After meeting Freedy, an african american volunteer, Emile is forced on a bloody charge. That point is when te dices start rolling and the war takes a life of its own. Through out the story you will meet Ana, a beligan nurse in search of her father and a dog.The Story represents this characters with their own reason for being in the war. None of them wants to actually kill other soldiers. It does not represent any side as the evil side or good side, it represents every one as a human being trying to survive what can be compared to armaggedon. The game makes you fill that the war is responsible for every death.Graphics: The game runs on Ubisoft's Frame Work engine (Child of Light, Rayman Legends). It is beautiful. The art design makes you belive that no man's land, the trenches, the tunnels underneath the trenches and the destroid cities and villages are scenes from hell.But not every thing is intentionally scary. Scenes in the country side and in Paris make feel the contrast between life and war. The beauty and civility of peace contrasts with the chaos and terror of war.The characters is Ubisoft's ace in the hole. The design for them is what I can say ""cute"", the way that every male character is fat and the way that the hair or hats hide the eyes make you have an emotional connection between every character in the game not only the protagonist. This makes that every death and tragic scene hit right at home.The gameplay: The fact that the game is puzzle oriented helps the idea that war is what brings the death of the innocent. The puzzles are easy and varied which is great because it keeps up with the story.Soundtrack: Every song adds to the ambience of the game. The scene leaving Paris will leave you speechless. And that piano theme will haunt you till the end of your days.Conclussion: I would like to say that we should all give thanks to Ubisoft because they spent their time researching the history and letter of this horrible war to bring an authentic feel to the game. It does not hurt to mention that the game is inspired on the letters sent by the soldiers.The game can be played by anyone from every age, gender, race or nation. Let me rephrase that: This game must be played by everyone. It managed to make every one a human being, the real antagonist is the war.Ubisoft has made this a model to be followed by every genre in entertainment that wants to convey ananti-war messeage.Valiant Hearts is the appex of anti-war material.Valiant Hearts is the reason I play videogames.Thank you Ubisoft."

I honestly don't know why, but after playing Valiant Hearts: The Great War (or Unknown Soldiers: Memories of the Great War, for those of you who are French speakers) it may be a habit that changes.I have always been fascinated by military history, particularly that of the 20th century, so I suppose it was only a matter of time before the game and I were aquainted.My curiosity was first tickled by the thought of a World War I game that wasn't a giant geopolitical simulator. If you try to find a WWI PC game that is anything other than a geopolitical simulator, you are going to compile a very short list.I was also drawn to the stylisation of the game, despite worrying about whether or not this whimsically (and stunningly) drawn cartoon of a game was going to trivialise something as cataclysmic as the Great War. If anything however, I would say that Valiant Hearts is not only a very good game, but I would say it is almost important that it should be played. That's right. I said that about a video game. Deal with it.The game starts with the outbreak of the First World War, a family is torn apart by the impending conflict; a father joining the Germans, a Grandfather joining the French. After the tearful cutscene (oh, there are a LOT of those) you are placed in the shoes of the French Grandfather Emile, and begin your conscription into the French army. The whole experience is chock full of pomp and that whimsy stuff, everything is bursting with colour and gayety (the French even have their historically accurate bright red trousers!). After a few more cheerful scenes of tomfoolery and mischief, the French finally march into battle against the waiting Germans, the Grandfather Emile carrying the regimental standard as the French advace slowly on the German positions.From the minute the German fire the first shot, you are robbed of that sense of light hearted cheer, as a French officer's body it ripped to shreds by artillery fire. As you charge across the field, avoiding heavy fire, the battered and torn bodies of French soldiers pile up, the colours fade and are replaced by the horrors of war.It's here the traditional puzzle elements really start to kick in and it starts off at a pretty relaxed pace, streadily getting harder over time. The progression is done rather well, with puzzles starting out easily and eventually evolving into real stinkers (for me that is, being a puzzle novice). To break it up there are some skill elements added to the game and skill based levels too, giving this game a nice balance of puzzle and traditional sidescroller, despite being quite reliant on script.The in-game collectables are pretty nifty trinkets from the era, helping flesh out the history of the Great War and greatly compliment the diaries of the characters and the in game encyclopedia. It is fair to say a concerted effort was made to add educational elements to the game, maybe even for kids, which I really appreciate.The style of the game is very reminiscent of the French cartoon film ""Belleville Rendez-vous"" in term of it's athetics and how they are both largely devoid of any form of dialogue. For a game set in one of the bloodiest conflicts of human history, Valiant Hearts is almost completely free from blood and gore. One would think that this would rob from the experience of a game set in the Great War, but trust me, with the direction that has been taken, this does nothing of the sort. I'd go so far as to wager that this jovial little title does more to immerse, shock and horrify the player than most story driven games of a gory persuasion. This direction again, could be seen as an attempt to make Valiant Hearts more accessible to younger kids.The story and characters are just fantastic. Utterly sublime. The story is beautiful and tugs at the heartstrings from start to finish and is told wonderfully throughout the game. The characters are so endearing its stupid. Seriously, it makes me feel bad. Even in short playthroughs of this game I have felt more empathy for 2D cartoon drawings than I have for people I would call close personal friends! And Goddamn it, if they don't have the cutest damn video game dog in history to help you on your quests. GAAAAAAAH!I haven't seen a better job of storytelling and character development done by any game in the past few years, which when you consider the characters mostly communicate in pictures or by grunting at each other is pretty bloody impressive.It's actually quite clever what has been acheived here. Valiant Hearts perfectly captures the feeling of euphoria felt by many across Europe at the start of World War I. Ordinary people on both sides were genuinely ecstatic that war had broken out and wanted nothing more than to see the other side beaten. Steets were filled with flag waiving crowds, marching bands and troops paraded like toy soldiers while brightly coloured, jongoistic propaganda and recruiting posters covered walls. It must have been difficult not to get caught up in the excitement, only for the reality of war to be more horrifying than anything anyone could have ever perceived. The world's first industrial total war - killing done on an industrial scale, which could not have been more different from the street parties and colourful posters calling for young men to give the enemy a bloody nose.Valiant Hearts DOES this to you. It gets you caught up in that slightly dizzy euphoria and then, without warning, throws you into that man made hell of artillery, trenches, machine guns, tunnels, barbed wire, mud and gas. What makes it so heartwrenching is that the whole world is this happy little comic book, so beautifully drawn, and it is torn apart in front of your eyes, with awful trials and terrible things done to the protagonists you have come to genuinely care about.It is for reasons like these that I believe it is important that people play Valiant Hearts. On the surface it's a reasonably enjoyable puzzler, but underneath that it is so much more. It's a story about finding good in times where humanity is at it's worst. It's a story about love, revenge, friendship, loyalty, courage and a doggy. Most important of all perhaps is that it gives people a taste of the feeling that permeated the world at that time and delivers a moderate wealth of historical facts and information to boot. This game was made with at least some intention of teaching people. If I had to teach young kids about the Great War, this would be my first tool to give to them.Sure the gameplay itself is fairly average, but Valiant Hearts is a fantastic creation, with this unique character, so much so it borders on art. I have never cried at the end of a video game and I still haven't, but I came bloody close with this beauty.Valiant Hearts; charming, enjoyable, whimsical, jovial, thoughtful, joyful, tearful, beautiful, loveable."

Not from the perspective of generals or career military men, but from the perspective of those who were pulled into the conflict, separated from their loved ones, thrown into horrific situations, and fought bravely.One of the reasons I love productions like this is that it inspires me to learn more. I find myself searching YouTube for videos on WWI and looking for summaries of historical events.The gameplay is mostly puzzles which I found fun but only ever moderately challenging.

,Recommended,260230,17519714,"Posted: 13 August, 2015",all,Slayve,"This game reminds me a lot of Never Alone, the game about an Inupiat girl. It is similar in a couple of ways: The gameplay is light puzzle solving, but the main impact of the game comes from the story and the educational aspects. The gameplay in Never Alone is a bit more physics-based with light platforming, whereas Valiant Hearts is mostly puzzle solving with some timing-based driving and running sequences for variety. Valiant Hearts is never particularly challenging, though you will probably have to replay a few sequences until you get the timing just right. The checkpointing is reasonable, though, and I never found the game frustrating.The primary similarity between the games is the educational aspect. Never Alone breaks up the gameplay with videos describing Inupiat culture and history. These are presented as interesting interviews with actual Inupiat, and add a lot to ground the game in the culture. Valiant Hearts includes a lot of information about World War I, including archival photographs. Although I found the information interesting, I think they could have done a better job of presenting the history of the war. For instance, there are many historical objects used as collectibles, each with a short description. The objects range from military items like helmets to everyday civilian items like ration cards. However, the list of items could have been more varied. There must be half a dozen different kinds of dog tags, for instance, the differences between which would only be interesting to WWI military historians (and maybe not even to them!). The writing of the descriptions is also not the best, though I think part of the problem is that they were obviously translated from the original French.Special mention should be given to the art and music. The game is built using the UbiArt engine, the same engine used for Child of Light and the recent Rayman games. It gives games a hand-drawn aesthetic that looks like an animated graphic novel. It is used to particularly good effect in Valiant Hearts, which is primarily a 2-D game but with multiple levels of background that move in parallax with the character's movements. This gives the gamespace a unique feeling of depth, even though the action all takes place in two dimensions. There are also doors and pathways that sometimes take you into the background layers, linking multiple 2-D levels and further enhancing the feeling of physical depth. The music is softly beautiful, sounding period-appropriate but not dated. It adds a lot to the overall melancholy feeling of the game.The gameplay of Valiant Hearts is simple but engaging, the art and music are beautiful and dynamic, and the story is touching. This is a game with a lot more heart than we're used to seeing, and I think it's well worth your time."

My style of gaming is fairly casual (I enjoy a good shooter but im terrible at them).Valiant Hearts brings much more to the table than many games I have seen. It provides historical backgrounds about happenings and objects that were common to WWI and does so in an intesting and artistic way. You could consider it a tool for learning a little history about the first world war.Aside from all the book-worm historical stuff Valiant Hearts comes equipped with a great story line. There are characters who you will enjoy from the moment they emerge. The way these characters find eachother and care for eachother, in this most trying time of their lives is very inspiring.The bonus for a casual gamer, this game is easy to navigate, thats not to say it isnt challenging. The game is about solving puzzles with your team to progress through the action. The movement is simple left, right, climb, pick-up, throw, and interact. You also interact with your dog who's an integral part of your team. The puzzles arent so difficult that you spend countless minuets figuring them out. However getting them right, the first time, every time, is difficult. I enjoy that there are multiple levels of challenges to every scene. If you can accomplish them all thats great, but your not held back if your leave a little behind or if you dont succede the first time.Valiant Hearts gains my heighest praise for games. The whole thing looks great, total eye-candy. Its educational, it actually teaches you something and in a way thats not forcing it down your throat. It is emotional, the trials of the characters in this game are something that you can't help but contemplate on a deeper level.

The gameplay varies, so you don't get tired of doing the same thing over and over. Puzzles, dodging bombs, car chase scenes (I loved these), hiding behind cover, digging, firing mortars. None of the game mechanics are ground breaking and the gameplay is not very challenging (although there is a veteran mode, which I didn't try). But, the story is enjoyable and the gameplay is integrated brilliantly, with the mechanics causing tension at the right times.Really, this is a game is all about the characters and their story. The main characters are nicely developed and the minor characters stand out too. I like dark stories and this game has some very dark moments, as well as light ones. At times, I wasn't sure how I felt about the sometimes comical treatment of such serious subject matter, but overall, I think they handled the subject matter well and it's clear that they wanted to teach players about this major event in human history, while telling a story and providing a fun adventure game.Time played: 8 hoursRating: 3.5 / 5Reminded me of: Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons & Tiny Thief"

Filled with a colourful, unforgettable cast of characters who are not the usual pumped-up, gun-toting soldiers, but normal people in need of sympathy for getting caught in an event greater than themselves.These characters are true to the title; they are, of course,valiant hearts.Story & AestheticsIn the positive light, I absolutely loved the pacing of the story that bounces from sad to serious to comical (the driving scenes were a great laugh!) to sad again. The art style will draw glances from the younger generation but does not in anyway whitewash the terror of the various theatres of war as they unfold. The choice in music accompanying the different gameplay scenes is well-planned and the game's theme is a simple, memorable and moving piece.The only negative aspect I can think of is the way historical facts are displayed with vintage photos that does not flow with the rest of the game that is done in solid lines and digital paint. However, these facts are optional to look at, and I disagree with most reviewers saying the pop-up notifications of new, unlocked facts are distracting - they really aren't.GameplayValiant Hearts makes use of only the directional keypad, wasd, left-shift, left-alt and spacebar. Only the menu screen(s) has use of the mouse. It's a little disconcerting to hit the directional keys to move characters around, like in vintage games, and the wasd for character powers, but a few minutes of practice and it'll come naturally to the fingers.With these few keys, the game shines with the variety of puzzles laid out for characters to complete. The game starts with simple collect-and-go puzzles and steadily progresses to more elaborate ones that encompasses satisfying the various needs of NPCs that chain together. Stumped on a puzzle? The game employs a simple, timer-based 'hint' system to guide the player through it in the form of subtle 'screenshots' of the level.What excites the most is the variety of missions that characters go through, including straighforward, big - and I mean BIG -  tank fights, stealthy avoid-the-spotlight escape missions, and hilarious driving scenes that pits players against threats synchronised to iconic 20th Century pieces. The creativity displayed in the lay out of many of the missions alone is well-worth the price of the game.ThoughtsOverall, Valiant Hearts is an easy to pick up, memorable and well-polishedexperienceaccessible to all ages and I highly recommend adding it to your library. Or else, gift it to your non-gamer friends or family to get them interested in the hobby.The fight scenes will keep some hearts pumping, the moving setpieces will melt even the coldest of them, and the bittersweet ending will break all of them.Hats off to Ubisoft for creating a masterpiece of sight, sound and story that highlights the Great Big Lesson™ to be learnt:War is bad.

The Germans, especially the ""big bad"" of the game, is portrayed as an over-the-top buffoon, and the technology that should be truly terrifying -- artillery, chlorine gas, tanks -- is instead very steampunkish and silly-looking a lot of the time.Nevertheless, overall it works, and is an excellent adventure game even if it's not *quite* the total masterpiece of a WW1 tale that it wants to be (though it reaches that height on a few occasions)."

It provides countless challenges and puzzles and really makes you think outside the box. The story is beautifully crafted. You feel a real bond with the characters and their goals are your goals.

The car missions are by far my favorite, being synchronized to classical music makes them far more exciting and fun in terms of the action sequences found in the game. Despite not being voiced, the characters are all very likeable and it's their actions and the interactions the four playable characters have with one another that will keep you invested in the story. The overall gameplay involves simple puzzles with a simple hint system to back you up if you ever get stuck( These are not brain busters though ) and the gameplay has enough variety that it never felt stale in combination with the changing scenery throughout the chapters. The story is by far its strongest suit and it's what kept me glued to my chair and to finish this game in one sitting. Highly recommended."

It has brilliant puzzles, great characters, fun gameplay, an amazing soundtrack, and what I think puts it in my ""Must Play Games"" catagory, the storyline.The storyline is brilliant. It switches to one of four characters each level: Karl, a young German man who lived in France, exiled and forced to fight for Germany to get back home to his wife and son, Marie and Victor, Emile, Karl's father in law and probably the nicest, most helpful man drafted into the French Army, Freddie, a new friend of Emile's and an American soldier who joined the French Army to get revenge, and Anna, a Belgian nurse who wants to help the wounded and find her father.The switching between characters makes the storyline feel dramatic and amazing; one minute you're watching a cliffhanger of a cutscene where a character may or may not have perished, and you switch to another character who does something important to the story during their level so that you pay attention during the level and not rush through it to see what happens to said other character.And let's not forget the dog. The loveable Doberman Pinscher dog medic named Walt. His gameplay is essential to finishing puzzles, and his story is essential to your feelings because no one ever wants the dog to die, unless you play Call of Duty and murder attack dog after attack dog. Walt is my favourite part of the game. He connects all of the characters even when they aren't together at those moments. Although destiny and friendship is the theme of the game, Walt is the embodiment of those themes.Overall, this game is a must buy for everyone. Not just storyline fans, puzzle lovers, history buffs, or dog huggers. Everyone. This includes the die-hard fans of Call of Duty or Battlefield, or any other shooter, so that they know what they cause whenever they pull that virtual trigger. I rate this game 9.5/10."

It uses the characters' abilities such as digging, healing or cutting very effectively. The game is also very immersive. You know what the characters and all the other NPCs are thinking.

The art is quirky and charming without taking away from the serious tone of the game. The music is on point and while it doesn't quite reach the level of some of my other recent favourites (Ori and the Blind Forest, Child of Light), it certainly holds its own. There is also a rich supply of World War I facts that you unlock by completing levels, finding collectables, etc. This adds a really nice incentive to care about the completion of the game, and is also a fun and interesting way to learn about WWI.Unfortunately, the game has some real cons. The playstyle of the game is somewhere between action and puzzle-solving. In my opinion though, it does not really do a great job of either of these. The puzzles are mostly pretty facile. They generally just feel like busywork, and walking back and forth can be a bit trying at times. The action is usually similarly dull, except for the times when it does get a bit exciting but the controls are not responsive enough to be satisfying.Play this game if you are looking for a casual game with a good overall atmosphere.

And that I think is already a nice thing about the game.However despite the fact that you are in aworld warthe story is mainly about the characters and their struggles as they try to outlive the raging conflicts going on around them, which made me get quite attached to them despite actual speech being (Mostly) absent in the game. There are a few mumbles, but thats pretty much all that you're gonna get out of the nicely styled people.And speaking of style, the game has a certain hand drawn type that I found quite visually appealing and oddly fitting, since it's sort of cartoony in some aspects and yet manages to convey seriousness and sadness when it wants to, and if you've gotten attached to the characters to the same extent that I did, then you WILL cry at somepoint or another.Sadly though, as I stated up above this game is more about telling a story along with puzzles to keep the player engaged, which while it does make a nice story with the various characters paths intricately crossing a certain points it means the there's no replay valure to be had after you've beaten it and cried, and the game isnt that long in the first place so you'll get about the same amount of time that I do and you probably won't ever come back to it like me, which is a damn shame because I would've certainly liked to have seen and played more.Honestly I don't really know what to say form this point out though, as most of it was said in the walls of text up above.But I DEFINATELY think this is worth getting if you want to experiance a nice story about some people from WW1, and 'I' certianly had a good time with it. I WOULD NOT recommend this to people looking to get hooked on EXCITING GAMEPLAY and whatnot because like I said there's not really any replay value, but i'd overall recommend it besides that.RECOMMENDED!"

But few games really grab me anymore, maybe its age I don't know.  I just don't find many games very fresh or unique.  I feel lucky to have discovered gaming when I did, each new title was a completly new ride, everywhere you turned gaming was a trip to the unknown.    For me that has pretty much ended, there just isn't much new or fresh,Valiant Hearts has renewed my faith,  i'm so glad I stumbled on what is in my top 5 games I have played this year, just excellent...what a cool game.    In this age of hyper realistic graphics, the cartoon approach I normally just skip right over,  if you're like me and tempted to do the same thing....dont....the mood and atmosphere they are able to create with such simple side scroll gameplay and graphics is (at least for me) completely refreshing and unique.  This game oozes atmosphere.   I found myself stopping many times just to enjoy the scene and watch all that was going on in the  background.  The animation is adorable while at the same time perfectly effective at getting the point across.  Same to the the gibberish dialogue...in perfect accent.. which is wonderful.  The music is great as well.I found myself drawn in to the story, the characters and of course the time period.  If you don't know much about WW1 the game does a great job of educating on the basics and will link you to more information if you are interested. I do know a fair amount about WW1, and thought the way it is presented in Valiant Hearts is wonderful and full of tension and weight while still being fun to play... to me that is a feat...the designers should be applauded.   I even got attached to the dog.  I thought the puzzles were well balanced and  just difficult enough to require some thought and a few tries to get through them.   Highly recommended, and appears to be an overlooked gem."

If you don't think your computer is capable of running this game at 60 fps, I don't recommend buying it. But if you have a quality computer and some money burning a hole in your pocket, I deeply recommend Valiant Hearts: The Great WarIt's difficult, in my opinion, to find a war game that is mostly unbiased or handles historic themes (accurate or not) with even a semblance of class. Despite the gore, this is a game I would feel comfortable letting a young teen play. The messages are deep and plentiful. The game succeeds at telling the story of war without extreme amounts of demonization. It shows that the soldiers, officers, workers, women and children of war all share a common goal.. to live happily. People in all walks of life are shown struggling in a system that leaves little choice for comfort or morality.Valiant Hearts is filled with mostly puzzles that require finding the correct order of events or time-based. They are slightly challanging, but far from difficult. Although I think the method of telling stories out of timely order is strange, by the end of the game you feel connected to the characters and have come to understand how they all came together. The collectables are all actually very interesting... I found myself wanting them simply for the sake of knowledge. God knows I didn't want them for the ubisort achievements...You are presented with characters, and once you become attatched to them, you desire to learn about their world. I never enjoyed history back in school... But now, I ""know"" people who have experienced the war, and feel inspired to understand their actions and emotions.Valiant Hearts: The Great War is an emotional journey that I encourage you to take."

Also the puzzles were a bit too easy, but the story makes up for it.Totally worth buying. 9/10"

It is one of those rare, but magical experiences that really sticks with you a long time afterwards. The story is complex and well-written, the characters lovable and rememberable, the gameplay is thight and precise, though a little repetitive at times.In lenght the game clocks in at about 7 hours, which may not be that long but is just as long as it needs to be. The puzzles aren't the hardest to figure out and can at times be tedious and frustrating, but they do provide a bunch of fun and interesting moments.I particularly liked the collectable items and fact cards. If you want a video game to learn you about the real history of World War One, look no further than Valiant Hearts. If you are like me you will spend a lot of time treasure hunting for items after having finished the story, just to learn about all the fascinating items that were used in the Great War.Valiant Hearts is one of those games you don't play; you experience it. It is a masterly crafted rollercoaster of joy and dispair, of love and war. I recommend it from the deapest of my heart, to anyone and everyone who might read this review. Because quite frankly, saying Valiant Hearts is a good game would be like throwing another bucket of water into the Pacific Ocean."

Its story is mainly narrated and surrounds the lives of 4 individuals who meet up under less than favourable circumstances.Pros+ The story for the most part is enjoyable. It's told through stills and some comic book style panelling in some areas.+ The audio and sound design is extremely well done.+ The visual design is one of the game's high points.+ Provides a lot of historical trivia about the aspects of war.Cons- Game refuses to start due to the version of Uplay which is installed when the game is installed not launching it. This happened to me on my Win 7 machine, if you run into this problem download the newest version of uplay directly from the net.- Gameplay is rather dull as it's main focus is the story and everything mostly suffers as a result.- The game becomes extremely boring and repetitive early on and after Chapter 2 I struggled to care as all I was doing were the same types of puzzles ad-infinitum. It's either a fetch quest type of puzzle where someone want a certain item, or a push block style puzzle, or a pull the lever style of puzzle. You'll be doing this for the 4 chapters which the game is comprised.- Everything about the puzzles feel either arbitrary or sometimes obtuse in what it's asking you to accomplish.- The backtracking in this game is more than in any metroidvanina I've ever played and that's really annoying as it's just to solve boring puzzles.- The controls feel really stiff and unresponsive at times. While I don't expect the fidelity of an action platformer I didn't expect movement to be slow.- There are quite a few of unnecessary quick time events in this game. Why. they added nothing that benefits the game.Irritations- At the end of the 3rd Chapter at the 'boss' fight the game refused to progress when I destroyed the boss's tank and forced me to replay the entire section. This was the straw that broke the camel's back as it was at this point I stopped playing.- Useless collectibles aspect scattered throughout each section in the chapters. I feel this was just added for repeatability sake than anything else.- A lot of things not just the puzzles feel arbitrary e.g. in chapter 3 Karl and Anna escape and the vehicle she's driving just happens to get a flat at a town housing some an army company who happens to have a spear laying out in the open. If it sounds ridiculous, guess what, it is.VerdictWhile the story is enjoyable for the most part it is hamstrung by just about everything else. From the onset the game has issues in that uplay fails to launch the game and the problems only worsen from then on. If the gameplay was exciting and puzzles fun then I'd see myself recommending it but as it stands I can't as the game is ultimately just a bore."

I would never argue that all games are, but some can be, and Valiant Hearts is one.   While it's set amidst WW1, the game is not about the fighting and violence, it's about the lives and stories of people who lived through it.  I'd label it a sidescroller/puzzle/story game.  You won't be picking up a rifle and shooting your way through the trenches.  You will get attached to the characters, and you will feel their emotions.  I recommend this to anyone who even occasionally wants more than mindless multiplayer action out of their games.  In short, Valiant Hearts is beautiful.

It doesn't highlight all the shooting in war like a Call of Duty or Battlefield game would. In fact, you don't hold a gun for the whole game. However, the way this game depicts war has a much greater impact than other war games I have played.This is a game purely about solving different puzzles. There were some puzzles where I just had no idea what to do and sometimes the solution wasn't apparent. But sometimes that is what makes puzzles so much fun. Some of the running back and forth was tedious but I got over it pretty quickly.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles and learning about the war. Really enjoyed my time playing it. I played for about 7 hours and i kind of ran through it.

While I found the puzzle solving overly simplistic with a hint system even involved if you were to somehow get stuck but the overall action gameplay was engaging and fun.My biggest problem with the narrative of this story is that for a story that is trying so hard to be taken seriously (using real life photographs of the war) and darker themes, the game tries to censor it's own violence and comes off as campy/tacky at times. For example, throwing a grenade would result in the enemies noticing then running away before the explosion - yet machine guns mow people down into bloody messes just 2 scenes later.This doesn't take too much away from the game so I can still recommend it but waiting for a sale is advised."

A nice addition are the unlocks, diaries and historical facts that make the atmosphere way more dense and tangible.

If you want to experience the game, you're going to have to deal with it. As for my own, personal experience using this DRM with this game, I ran into multiple hangs and times when the product would fail to start. The startup of the title isn't seamless as you'd expect from the rest of the games sold on Steam without this DRM, and may cause some frustration. There was a bug during one of the driving sequences where the game wouldn't move forward, but I can't say with any certainty that the DRM was at all to blame for this.As everyone else has said, the game (ending) is a tearjerker. Honestly, the reviews and studies I've read on this game caused me to read more deeply into the sadness of the story than there really was in reality. Had I not heard of the game beforehand, I wouldn't have thought of the game as being exceptionally sad at all with the exception of the trailer/parts of the opening and the ending. The 2D comicbook visuals don't help paint the grim reality either, but at the same time do a lot more than just hint at the darkness hidden just out of frame by the display. Much of the game is lighthearted. The ending will drag your valiant heart through the mud.I would say the game was worth it. I don't feel cheated by having had to use Ubisoft to experience it. However, when I look at the Uplay app on my desktop, I'm disgusted that they have gone well out of their way to give gamers a bad experience that didn't have to be there to begin with. The achievements I didn't get I have no urge to strive for because they are not tied to my steam account.I may play through this again someday. I'll be removing Uplay and reinstalling it again at that point, if they still haven't learned their lesson after cluster♥♥♥♥s like Watch Dogs.Get it cheap, to punish Ubisoft."

As the credits rolled I felt much like I did after I first saw Saving Private Ryan: somewhat in shock and awe.  The chaos at home, the death and struggles on the front line, and everything else in between, this game showcases the endurance of the human spirit despite unimaginable adversity.  The gameplay is simple and straightforward with some challenging puzzles and the game is chock full of excellent trivia that provides a very down to earth perspective of the life of those involved in the war. The figures such as death tolls are staggering.  Like any good war piece, it is bittersweet.  I'll avoid spoilers, but truly there is no winner in the end."

This is how it changes the lives of so many for so few. The story is about four main characters; the Frenchman Emile, his German son-in-law Karl, American soldier Freddie, and Belgian nurse Anna. The game is inspired by real life letters which was written during the devastating great war from 1914-1918.How did 'The Great War' BeginWorld War One begins with the assassination ofArchduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary, onJune 28th 1914. The assassins known as the 'Black Hand' assassinated the Archduke for the  declaration of war on Serbia. This caused Austria-Hungary and their allies (Germany) to declare war on SerbiaOn 28 July. In for a shock the Serbians quickly called up arms and got their allies Russia to help and support Serbia. Meanwhile Germany (allied with Austria-Hungary) mobilizes and invades neutral Belgium and Luxembourg before moving towards France, leading Britain to declare war on Germany.Gameplay & MechanicsThe gameplay for Valiant Hearts is 2D but it's simple mechanics make up for the immersive puzzles and story telling. The puzzles in this game can be quite unique as it is historical, intense and fun. The graphics in Valiant Hearts suits the game well, as it mixes realisim with cartoon effects that suggests the game is hiding the real effects of blood and gore and tells the people's story from a different angle. They also issued historical events and facts on the main screen to tell us, on that level what really happened and what was introduced into the war.ConclusionIn conclusion Valiant Hearts is a well made simple game, that shares the knowledge of letters from World War 1 to tell us an epic story of four characters and there lives during 'The Great War'. At the end of this review Valiant Hearts is an outstanding game with in-depth story and simple 2D gameplay. In total I give Valiant Hearts an9/10for a rich story, amazing 2D gameplay, historical events, facts about the war and lastly, the time and effort the developers has taken in to make such a wonderful game of history and friendship."

While people die around you, you run around and perform silly little puzzles.

I'd go so far as to call it a very important game, as it is one of the most human, fair, and touching representations of World War 1. The art style is fantastic and the animations are endearing. The music is wonderful, and the gameplay is both intuitive and fairly challenging without being unfair. This game is about a different side of war. It's about the support roles. You spend more time helping your fellow human than you do hurting them in this game. The game also fairly portrays both sides of the war and scrutinizes both of them. I feel that all sides involved are lovingly stereotyped in a way that is more comical than insulting. You'll see Frenchman guzzling wine, surrounded by bread and cheese, as well as Germans wolfing down sausage and chugging beer, As someone of German descent, I found the stereotypes to be comical rather than offensive. The comedy of the game is very often in stark contrast to it's sadness and portrayal of human attrocities. I found that the game managed to convey emotion very effectively through this dichotomy. The endearing and comical parts truelly give credence the bleak and horrific parts and vice versa due to the sudden shifts between the two. Overall, this is a very human and different depiction of war that happens to be a fantastic game as well. I highly reccommend it."

You simmer with every character and wish you could just walk them back to there normal lives...In any case: this game is awesome and should be played also for educational reasons!The story telling is choosen totally perfect and you want to hear more about the case what happen (which you can by reading letters and history documentation). There was one time I accidently skipped a sequence which I immediatly restarted, before playing it to the end!If you are a farmer gamer you can pick over 100 collectable items (i doubt that any will find all by first gamethrough). Maybe if you are a little bit hardcore gamer the story is played in about 4.5 hours. But this shouldn't hold back to buy it (also for the full price) because it intertains not only by the first time playing!Others said it before: this game will try to make you cry... and yes... it can achieve this.I loved it and feeled with it. You will too. Guaranteed."

The dog is such a dear and he makes you wanna pet him too! It's a relaxing game and way too fun to not play.

A classic-style gem with modern era design in an era not seen in very many games: World War One. A nice change of pace from the mindnumbing and tedious bulls#!@ that we come to expect of from a war game( Not to say that I dont like the occasional COD game but the devs of those types need to put more into them instead of using the same old s#!@ or by changing minute things)   The art design is spectacular. The 2d  WWI environments are brilliantly and beautifully realized. The story is action-packed and has tearful, cringe worthy and WTF  moments  and is reasonably lengthly (10 hours for me) and the  characters are ones to remember. The control is  fluid for the most part;  sometimes you scroll, in certain segments, too fast,  ending in death when you leat expect it , but for the most part it is fine. A good deal of variety in the puzzles you have to solve which are sometimes logically challenging, making you hit you yourself in the head when you do figure them out. Plenty of collectables to get, which you probaly wont get all in one playthrough. Only minor con is it kinda is ""one shot, your done"" kinda game which means you might replay it again to soak up all this game has to offer but likely you'll play it again after an extended period of time. All in all, you should pick it up, regardless of whether its on sale, as it is worth your time and money and you wont regret it in the least."

Valiant Hearts: The Great War presents us a story of a family and their friends separated by the World War I. I can't say this is refreshing storyline in the gaming industry, but plays on emotions and touches from time to time.I also have to admit, that the game looks great - it is not Far Cry 4 or any AAA production, but has its own, unique style. The same could be told about the sounds.Unfortunately, one of the main parts of the gameplay - solving rather easy riddles - is annoying sometimes. As I said - they are easy, but it happened to simply stuck on the puzzle. An example could be throwing a dynamite to a container of some kind, when you have to aim quickly and very precisely. This could be too difficult for the kids and the game could become frustrating for them. It also made me mad a couple of times, when I had to quit the game and then repeat the whole level again. Yes, there are checkpoints, but when you want to leave before the level ends, then you have to be ready for this.However, I've enjoyed every minute of this (sometimes frustrating) game.

The art style is charming and dark when it needs to be, and captures how horrible WWI was in its own unique way without having to be super graphic. The story is very touching and sad, and each character has their own personality and backstory, that you can't help but feel for each of them. Not only that, but the game is very informative on the history behind WWI, an event that isn't really discussed in great detail. You can learn a lot from it, from the historical facts and special items you can find throughout the maps, about the war and how horrific it was. Half the time while playing, I was horrified with what happened in the game, and I think it captures that very well. The music helps to add to that, epic and great for battles, and slow and sombre for th emore horrible parts. Its a great soundtrack.Some of its puzzles can be frustrating to solve, which is my only complaint about it, but otherwise, its a fantastic game, and really deserves attention. Its ending made me cry, and yknow what? its okay if you do too."

,Recommended,260230,15077595,"Posted: 27 March, 2015",all,Stormtrooper EM-1992,"Valiant Hearts is a 2D puzzle game takes place during the events of World War I. I must admit outside of the subplot of the Baron, the game is very well done and it's good in my aspect. In fact, the game can be colorful and cartoony except it doesn't shy away from the horrors of World War I. The story about a aging Grandfather who was conscripted to fight in a war whom he met along a African American whom formed as buddies and a medical dog. The heart of the game is the characters had to go though in the conflict. The game doesn't require guns to say since Ubisoft designers were going for and it's a change of pace due how many FPS games out there.1. Story- The plot of the game is just straightforward and emotional the story gets. There are subplots to such as the Baron's plans to win the war, Anna's Dad, Karl's escape, and other is not a bad idea. Although the Baron plot was out of here and sounded like a cartoon show doesn't make sense in the conflict unless he could appeared in a DLC where he's a rouge German commander at the end of World War I. The rest are very good which it's not bad except for the Baron plot.2. Characters- The characters are developed and have their own personality. Emile and Freddie are my favorite characters in the game. The rest are great as well in part of the story.3. Art- Given the nature as a cartoon, but more a comic book-like feeling to it. In fact, it can be a Comic book video game which I enjoy of the backgrounds. The characters can be expressive despite of their hair covered their eyes, but works effective.4. Sound- The characters don't talk to say. They rather make grunts, but the balloon speak help the player to think. The music is very classical and it's a good thing because it's mostly good kind of orchestra music. I like the music in this game.5. Gameplay- It's a 2D puzzle game where it requires thinking to figure the puzzle. However, there are some puzzles are obvious and others are tricky as well. There are some parts in the game can be frustrating, but the end results can be very fruitful in the end.Overall: Based on the gameplay and experience on the game along with everything else above, I give this game a very good rating of A- for good story out of the Baron subplot, good gameplay, and greater understanding about World War I. My recommendations to players who wish to know about World War I and for puzzle games as well."

,Not Recommended,260230,15293260,"Posted: 10 April, 2015",all,Ghost Ryder,"I went into this game hearing all but good things from it. Upon doing my research into this title, I noticed that Uplay was required to play this game. Although Uplay is the spawn of Satan I decided to dive into the rocky side of the beach to experience this title.Before I continue please understand this is my personal opinion of how I felt this game was. Whether or not I am right or wrong in some points is not going to alter my view of this game.To begin with I believe that the gameplay in this game is so trivial and boring that it left me wondering what I was doing playing this still. The entire time of playing I felt like a delivery boy going back and forth time and time again taking bits and pieces of machinery and equipment which had no place being anywhere else and fixing it all.  The puzzles are deceptively simple and almost patronising to other games of this genre. The only difficult puzzles were the ones that required use of the 'tool' which is your incompetent dog partner. I found him to be very unresponsive to what I told him to and to me he felt unneeded. Sure some of the nooks and crannies would never have been accessible by a main character but still in that case move the objective to somewhere you can get to.The characters, which is where the story is meant to be, felt plain and uninteresting. I felt no connection what so every for them an any way. The worst of them all though would be the main antagonist of the game which is the walking definition of a clichéd bad guy. With his ridiculous means of disrupting the main characters objectives it felt like I was ready a bad comic book.The ending, which seemed to be what most people held the high acclaim for  was predictable. Whether it was the frustrating guitar hero mini game segment beforehand that soured my heart to the end that cause me to not bat an eyelid at all, or the fact I'm a cold hearted person, either way I felt relief after the credits began as it meant I could uninstall this from my PC and forget it ever existed.As for the good points, of little there is, they had a interesting art style they were going for, but I feel this also affected this game negatively as it didn't seem fitting for a game conveying a story. The soundtrack for this game is very beautiful I must say, possibly the only driving point for this really.To conclude then, Valiant Hearts made an effort to try and convey the gruesome nature of WW1 but ultimately I felt it did nothing of the sort. The facts were hidden in the game though collectables and events that would tell some interesting facts of The Great War. I would have preferred some more narrated facts that intertwined with what was going on in the story but that's just my preference. The gameplay left me bored due to repetitive puzzles and objectives and the characters felt like they were pasted on top of clothes mannequins. Therefore I personally cannot recommend this title."

What I got was a beautifully told story that although is far from perfect is still one of the better stories I have seen from a video game in a long time.The gameplay is very simple but extremely satisfying. Most of the puzzles are extremely well designed and they are extremely well integrated into the story. And the game knows when is the appropriate time to end sections without it ever feeling like they have either gone on for too long or too little time.The sound design in this game does a great job at setting the overall tone of the game. The music in this game all sounds like it is from the period around the first world war. There is no actually voiced conversations in the game but the characters do express their emotions in very simple phrases that actually inhances the experience. An example would that one of the French characters always interacts with his dog by saying ""bon chien"" which means good dog. It isn't anything big but it gets the emotions of the characters across.The way the setting was handled is one of the things in this game which I find the most questionable. In this game the Germans are shown as undoubtably the bad guys. While this would be a more accepted thing in world war 2 games where the Nazis are seen as evil world war 1 was a grey mess where no one could actually be seen as a good or bad guy from an objective standpoint. A fairer portrayal would of been to show everyone as in the wrong. But since Ubisoft is a French developer and this game is about the invasion of France by Germany it is fairly obvious why the Germans are portrayed this way. Still knowing what world war 1 was about I found Ubisoft's portrayal of the Germans to be somewhat silly and  borderline racist.Now the story is the best part of this game and I don't want to spoil anything about it but to give a description of it this game is about the invasion of France in world war 1 where you play as several different characters who are all related to each other in some way. Then through these characters you see their experiances in the war.Overall great game and I highly recommend you playing it if you are a fan of great stories and/or puzzle games."

The game is set in WWI where you play as 4 different people with different backgrounds (plus the best dog in gaming, ever). You follow the elusive Baron Von Dorf for different reasons.The game shows a very unique take on the war genre and focusses more on puzzles and the story that shooting and killing. It is a welcome turn from the usual titles of the genre such as COD and others. Despite the occasional glitch or bug, it was overwhelmingly enjoyable in my humble opinionI consider myself someone who does not cry often, whether it be movies of games.

Taking a break from the standard item solving puzzles on occasion, are a few little rhythm style events and somewhat enjoyable (for want of a better description) musically choreographed dancing taxi events.At times the game can be have a fair bit of humour however at other times in contrast it does get dark especially in the latter stages but all the while it works fluidly with the story. Of particular note is the ending, though not to spoil it too much, the ending is done with a poignant respect similar to Blackadder’s poppy fieldsOne thing I found is that the game actually crosses over into the educational side of things. Whilst playing the game, each stage provides a couple pictures of the time themed around the stage and explains them in better detail, in addition there are several collectables on each stage to be found which are items of the day and explains how they were used.""Even though their bodies have long since returned to dust, their sacrifice still lives on.

Also, the tidbits you get by picking up collectibles are quite interesting, and and make some of the horrors of war really hit home. Gameplay is ok untill the last few missions, but it fails very hard during them. The last few puzzles remind me of how yatzee (from the escapist) described some adventure games ""stick your head is a container of acid fumes, leave it here for an hour, take it out, and try to solve the puzzle in the way that seems the most obvious at the time."" aka, the most convoluted and non-sensical way possible. Example: finding a dead end you cannot continue until you go back through the level until a ladder breaks under you. There are no indications that the ladder will break, and you climb down it completely fine the first time you use it. On a more positive not, music is quite good and generally fits the tine of the game very well. Overall it's a fairly good game with one serious flaw that doesn't appear until late in the game."

The story for this game that has been called ""deeply moving"" an ""emotional journey"" needs to lose those little lines of hype and give it a more accurate one fun for the whole family. There will be car chases with tanks following you and you trowing tnt and there will be a crazy villian that we made up. The few actually good scenes in the game are so far and in between I found my self being more captated by the characters of the story. Although I will to the games credit say the diaries each character has are exceptionally interesting along with the actual facts about the events that take place. That really made me ask why couldn't they have done more with this! Like for for minimal soilers one of the ending battles was so accurate it gave me chills.

I didn't know it existed, right up until I watched the E3 trailer of the game. It moved me deeply and instead of waiting to see what the critics had to say, I pre-ordered the game. I haven't regretted it.Valiant Hearts brings the player back to the dark years of the First World War. You will be controlling several characters, from both sides of the war, and follow their lives and struggles as they fight to survive. This game is not an action shooter though, nor is it a strategy game. It is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle game / platformer. Your character will regularly receive help in the form of a canine friend, allowing the pair of you to overcome several obstacles, be it sneaking past an enemy patrol or rescuing a wounded soldier. You do not require quick reflexes (bar a few instances where do you have to hurry up) and the puzzles are not only solvable by the holders of nuclear physics degree. And if you do struggle with a certain part, the game provides you a few hints if you ask for them. During my entire playthrough, I did not feel the need to look-up some kind of guide in order to get past a difficult situation.It's not only puzzles though. You'll also have a few action scenes, where you drive a tank or try to dodge bombs while driving a french taxi. These moments provide a nice distraction from the slower-paced puzzle sections and prevent the game from going stale. It might seem a bit far-fetched (a car being chased by a Zeppelin?) at times, but it did not overtly bother me. Your mileage may vary of course. Both the puzzles and the action mini-games are supported by a superb storyline. Ubisoft Montpellier have invested a lot of time in both creating an engaging story and maintaining the suspense of disbelief (even with the sometimes weird events). The game oozes authenticity. At regular intervals, you can read small information blurbs about the events that transpired during the First World War. The game mainly focuses on ""showing"", but the nice blurs of information satisfy the ""telling"" as well. If you keep your eyes and ears open, you'll fully experience the atmosphere of the French and German battlefields.The graphics themselves are what drew my first attention. They are highly stylized, well-drawn ""cartoons"". They are far from childish, but instead allow to both create an immersive scene without going over the top with regards to the full horrors of War. You will still flinch from time to time, but that's more because of the gravitas of the situation, not because you can see the innards of someone dangling from their belly. I cannot express how great the graphics really are and suggest you watch a trailer of the game to see it in action. The cartoony graphics also make it a great game for younger gamers as well. One does need to understand English (or French / German, depending on the localization) in order to get the most out of the game, but it is a game that will teach so much without becoming a long-winded historical dissertation. If I had a 12 year old running about, I would give him this game without a second thought.The voicework is excellent as well, with a great narrator tying the scenes together. The in-game characters speak some kind of gibberish, although you can recognise several words and sentences in the characters native languages (English, German and French). It once again helps to form a unique style to the game and it really works. I also want to give shoutout to the music. During several ""chase"" scenes, the game plays a few classical pieces which meshed well with the evens on screen. Beyond those scenes, the music complements the game well, never once being out of tune.The game is addictive and I played through it in 6 hours. I haven't found all the collectibles, though only a small number remain. I probably will play through the game a second time on a harder difficulty, just to finish it up. After that, there really isn't much replayability to the game. It is something that I will come back to after a few months or so, just to experience it again.

The art style and music direction are some of the best I’ve experienced in their category, taking the traditional flash styled game and ramping it up to the next level. The game mechanics are simple, enjoyable and thankfully stay out of the way of the story, leaving the player to enjoy Valiant Hearts for what it truly is. Finally the story is by far one of the best examples I’ve come across this year with all the characters receiving the right amount of screen time and development required for it’s ultimate emotional climax.

The game itself guides you towards its chosen path whilst never feeling forced, this is the most inteligent way i have ever seen a linear narrative play out. Getting the chance to view other character perspectives really keeps the content fresh and exciting as it bounces from viewpoint to viewpoint you build an increasingly solid picture of the game itself. I happen to be a fan of the war genre but i do not feel it attributed to my ejoyment of the game anymore than someone who wasn't. They have managed to bottle what real story telling is, encased in a wonderful art style reminiscent of grit comic sheek and accompanied it with a music score that lifts this up to be one of the most rewarding game experiences i have ever had.

Definitely feels like sort of a history lesson which was the part I liked, but there is basically no shooting except for a random cannon or tank fairly rarely. Most of the time you are running around solving fairly easy puzzles. There is no shooting of rifles or guns so if you are looking for a shooter this definitely isn't it. I thought the emotional parts were overly cheesy with the best being the end. Definitey worth a play, but it does start slow so if you find yourself getting bored early on just hang in there.

Not every character is a soldier but all have their own personal reasons for being involved in the war.

The story moves gracefully from character to character and each has unique types of challenges and puzzles. There's a challenge to find a handful of hidden items on each chapter, and the items reveal extra tidbits of the war experience, such as postcards, personal items, and equipment. These all add to the experience, really driving home the horrors of trench warfare and the futility of so many battles.The game isn't too long, but by the end you're really invested in the characters.

,Recommended,260230,13862792,"Posted: 6 January, 2015",all,Human Bean,"Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a fantastic game. This isn't a shocking revelation obviously, its gotten a 96% rating on the steam page at time of writing and you're probably aware of this. The best way to describe the game is that it progresses similiarly to the way the war was viewed by the civilian population at the time. The game begins as somewhat pulpy portyal of the war with heroic charges into enemy lines, flags held high and a clear antagoinst called Baron Von Dorf. However as the game carries on further into the war the tone of the game shifts over its four chapters. The game gradually becomes a depressingly realistic portrayal of the first world war, I will be vague in my descriptions for fear of spoliers, but as the game progresses several sequences mechanically repeat. There will be sections where you are charging the enemy for example and each time it becomes darker and harder to watch, portraying the perceptions of war at the time.Gameplay wise the game is similar to the lego games. You find a matching object. Put it in a thing, move on. Either that or you are working in rhythm. Driving a car and avoiding obstacles in rhythm with the music (imagine an easier audio surf but your facing the front of the car) performing first aid buy pushing buttons in rhythm and so on.The game only has two major issues. The first being Ubisoft's Uplay service, its not as bad as Watch Dogs Or Unity but is still worth mentioning and the second and more pressing issue is the games main villan Baron Von Dorf. He is present for 3/4 of the games chapters and comes off as far to video gamey for lack of a better description. I can understand why he's present, to maintain the inital pulp vibe. He overstays his welcome and is a pretty poor character.

One character does belong wholly in the cartoon world and feels too silly compared to the rest of the game (you'll know what I mean when you confront him, which happens much too frequently).Gameplay consists of puzzle solving on a complexity level that doesn't exclude anybody.Photos from the war accompanied by small factoids adds much authenticity and depth to the scenes, and I encourage all players to read those small pieces.At the end I came to care a lot about what happened to the characters you get to play as.

Take a deep breath, collect yourself.This game is worth the horrendous pain in the♥♥♥♥♥that is uPlay. You will not stop playing this once you start. You're not buying a game, honestly. It's really more of an interactive film.Right from the beginning, you will learn there's something odd about this title- it's not fun. It's just not. But that isn't it, and it won't bother you. I don't think it's even meant to be fun, but, for some reason, that doesn't matter. I don't know how, but you'll look past the entire ""a game is supposed to be fun"" concept. It's not something you'll even notice yourself doing. You forget you're playing a game, and suddenly you're following the drama of four people and a blissfully ignorant dog through one of the most horrific periods of human history.What's odd is the fact that for some reason, even though you're only given a brief run-down of a character's past (if at all), you'll suddenly give a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥about them. You will care.You'll grow attached, you'll make assumptions, try to guess the plot. You'll think characters have plot armor, like most other titles, and that they want to keep the main characters alive so you can feel all good about yourself.Sure, the art is sort of comic book-y, and arguably it's silly in some ways: gibberish-speaking soldiers, stereotypes played out for comedic relief, and sometimes absurd exaggerations of more silly ideas will occur, but that's only skin-deep.After the first scene you'll remember that this is a game about remembering those lost from 1914~18 and understanding the conditions into which these people went, either to uphold their country's honor, or to try and pull the twisted remains of still-living human beings out of the wreckage in a sick attempt to salvage them from the meatgrinder of nationalistic violence.Personally, I usually don't write game reviews. I think they're pretty douchey. Most of the time, I talk about the ""crunch"" of a game- mechanics, re-playability, how the engine works out, during the rare few times I am asked about my opinion of a game.As you can see, I've made an exception for this game.Here's some specifics to chew on:I'm a music geek. If a game has a good soundtrack, it instantly wins for me. Valiant Hearts ♥♥♥♥ing nails it, and by far has one of the best soundtracks of any game I have ever played, if not the best. It's incredibly well-written and fits perfectly snug and tight into the story and the context of each scene. I honestly didn't think it was possible for such a seemingly small game to have such an awesome sound to it. This, coupled with the art, makes for a hell of an experience for each scene.Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the art. It's so damn fitting. It's materful how well it describes the setting of the entire game- the First World War. At times, it's happy, vibrant, almost cheerful. The Parisian scenes are visually glorious; they portray a society in its prime, patriotic, and in its own world. At the same time, however, this same art style is absolutely evil. You will be betrayed by this feeling, and you will be surprised just how dark this game can be when you begin your foray into the third and fourth chapters (if you haven't already caught on during the second). There's just something downright horrifying about seeing a cartoonish Frenchmen getting his legs blown off by an artilleryshell, while in the foreground artwork the game subliminally flashes you past literal piles of corpses, badly bloodied and blasted.And that's another thing- the violence. Valiant Hearts does (yet again) an AMAZING job with how they present the war. You will not see too much blood, but when you do see it, it's unnerving. You would not expect to see it from the art-style used (see above), but yet they put it here. There are missing limbs occassionally, placed exactly where your eyes will drift. It is quite clear that they spared no expense in potraying the fact that you will not escape the horrors of what actually happened.As far as character development goes, it's simple and effective. I don't need a wall of text on this one to describe it; the way the characters are introduced, and how they develop through the plot and various sub-plots is masterful.Extra-crunch time:The mechanics are simple and easy to control, for the most part. It's sometimes difficult understanding what to do, but I kinda like that. I don't think a game about such a devastating conflict should be easy. Granted, there is a hint system, so if you do get stuck, the game will slowly give you hints (if you accept them) to help you along the puzzles. As for the puzzles, I loved how they did them. You cannot think in 2d here. Take everything you know about puzzle games and throw it far away. Valiant Hearts likes to use various tactics for solving puzzles. Some are simple, and painfully obvious. Others will have you running around the entire map thinking you've missed something, which you have. A rule of thumb here is to look where you think they couldn't possible have put something.As a side note to this, and maybe this is just me thinking too deeply here, but I interpreted this as sort of a way of U. Mont. to build into the game some level of recognition for the ingenuity people needed, and developed, to survive this conflict- they needed to think outside of the box to keep going, and so do you.The dog-buddy system is wonderful and easy to control. Simple as that.I especially like the ""facts"" tab incorporated into the game UI itself. It adds a unique educational twist which is invaluable to those who don't know too much about the War. Accurate, well-written, and partnered with good, credible sources. I hate the fact that I can't write more about this topic, but it's so complete. The historical facts put into the game accent it in a way that marks a game with true intentions on being as educational as it is an engrossing and entertaining experience to the player.As my wall of text nears completion, I can't help but sigh at what I've left out here. I've only scratched the surface. I read this over again, and think ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ is this what a tool sounds like?"" but I can't help it. This game has registered on a deep emotional level for me. I don't know why, but it's stirred some deep feelings about a friend of mine that I lost two years ago. I'm not too sure if I cried at the ending so much as my memories of him, but I can confirm that this game has reached its goal for me. I have a new perspective on the Great War, and I don't think it'll ever leave me. But I'm unsure if my perspective is too personal, to be rather frank. Perhaps I interpreted the message in a totally different sub-concious way than that which was intended. Whatever the case may be, the one thing you should take away from this pillar of hastily-written, clearly too-personal review is that this game promises to deliver an emotional impact on the player, past the game itself. And it will do that.This is one of the very few games that has delivered precisely what it promised."

Gameplay consists mostly of overcoming obstacles and solving environmental puzzles in order to progress through four chapters worth of story. There are certain sections that put you in control of Belgian vet-turned-army-medic Anna and her stolen taxi, in which you avoid obstacles that come at you in time to familiar classical music (I recognised ""The Can Can"" and ""Night at Bald Mountain"").One thing that pleasantly surprised me was how varied the environments are. Besides the trenches that are now synonymous with the conflict, you will take in the streets of Paris, a POW camp and a munitions factory, among others. The puzzles are pleasing to solve and while they generally boil down to the same handful of formulas, they are presented in ways that are for the most part not too jarring and fit naturally into the context of the location. There are also collectibles to find that give you tidbits of information about life in wartime for both soldiers and civillians, so exploring every nook and cranny in a level is encouraged.Because gameplay mostly consists of moving left to right and interacting with things in the world, the controls are far from taxing. There are a couple of instances in which you may end up flipping a switch on and then straight off again because you tried to move off while the animation is still playing, but this is easily avoidable by simply letting the button go after the animation has finished.How does it look?The style ofValliant Heartshas a unique graphic novel-style aesthetic that is very pleasing to the eye. The characters are nicely designed and the heroes are instantly recognisable, standing out amongst gaggles of troops. There is a kind of naivity to the way the characters look, with cartoony bodies and their hair over their eyes, but their desaturated colour pallettes lend themselves to the grim nature of the subject. Animation quality is superb throughout, with nice use of exaggeration in characters' movements and huge machines having a kind of rattling, cobbled-together nature that brings them to life (most of these machines could not have possibly existed in World War 1 but, hey, it's a videogame).The aesthetic of the game also lends itself to the grittier moments, such as when you encounter wounded soldiers or are caught out on the battlefield. The darker moments are genuinely chilling, and there are plenty of them.How does it sound?The soundtrack ofValiant Heartsis incredible. The epic orchestral scores in the battle scenes and during attacks add to the drama and excitement incomparably, and the gentler tracks make you appreciate the moments of peace. This soundtrack can make you feel whatever it wants you to, and I can only be thrilled about it.Long story shortPlease, please, please give this game a go. Not only is a fun little title, especially if you're a fan of environmental puzzle-solving, but it is a very important game. Released to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War 1, it is grim while still being accessible to a more general audience without being too sugar-coated. I believe it does justice to what was one of the most pivotal and savage conflicts of our time. It is definitely not for children, but I would urge you to experience this game. It's a brilliant and thought-provoking story punctuated with puzzles that make sense and are satisfying to solve, questionable vehicle sections and an overriding respect and sensitivity for its subject. Ignore the compulsory uPlay nonsense and enjoy. And remember:Never forget."

76561198117423688,Recommended,260230,13451020,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,madchemist28,"TL;DR,  Valiant Hearts manages to both educate about one of the most important events of the 20th century, whilst entertaining as a video game. That alone warrants a recommendation.The First World War, despite being one of the most important events in world history, has been comparatively overlooked by video games. This may be due to its successor having a much less sombre image in popular culture, and hence more opportunity to uppercut Fritz and his Axis mates. So already Valiant Hearts is subverting expectations; being a 2D adventure game with an art style comparable to Charley’s War, if it were written by Herge´.The game discards the usual cover-based shooting setup characterising most war games, instead opting for a “pick & mix” of various game modes. Usually, the game follows typical adventure game puzzle solving in a 2D environment. At other times, however, the player will be in a car, dodging obstacle in time to music; or following button prompts to perform surgery. This may seem a bit of a mess, but it actually mixes surprisingly well with the story.A particular example is when the player is driving a taxi full of French soldiers to the Marne (which was based on an actual event), jinxing past obstacles in time with the Can-Can; looking forward to getting to the front to give Jerry a damn good thrashing. When you actually get to the front, you are greeted with the putrescent stink of corpses and any notion of glory in warfare is lost as you rush to the aid of the wounded.Rather than being inconsistent, this juxtaposition further serves to set Valiant Hearts apart as a game about war. Whilst most war games use the setting for run-gun-fun, Valiant Hearts is less about the Great War itself than it is about those who took part in it. Most of the characters in the game would rather just go back to how things were before, but are unable to escape being drawn inexorably back into the conflict. This struggle is what drives the narrative, and elevates the cast above the cardboard cut-outs ubiquitous to most war games.In summary, Valiant Hearts manages to both educate about one of the most important events of the 20th century, whilst entertaining as a video game. That alone warrants a recommendation."

The story centres around the interwoven destinies of five characters, inspired by actual letters in that war.Each character has their different motivations, and it is through their camaraderie that they can act upon them. Each story is compelling, and you'll definitely be whole-heartedly immersed.The art direction and animation style is probably what you'll find the most striking. The 2D comic-style art doesn't attempt to hide the gruesome and brutal truths from the Great War, which is very important. These are incredibly sombre themes they were trying to tackle, and the fact they didn't skirt around or trivialise the horrors, is admirable. Its not all horrible, however. There is some great humour in parts, which eases up the tension.When travelling through each area, which is usually a famous setting or turning-point in the war, you can bring up war facts about the area, the conditions the soldiers lived in, etc. In addition, each level has collectables to find, which sheds further light in retelling what life was like at those times. This experience wasn't only immersive, but also educational. I learned far more here than I probably would in a lecture environment. Maybe, in future, games like these can be used for more formal educational purposes.The orchestral soundtrack was perfectly fitting to each scenario. Haunting when trudging past piles of corpses, yet delightful when in a car chases (to the music of the can-can, to name one!).The puzzles themselves have a perfect difficulty curve as you progress. In no point did I get truly frustrated, yet you feel pretty clever when you get it right. The tasks range from going on scavenger hunts, trading with several people until you get what you need, to digging your way around trenches, to safe-cracking. Plenty of variety.Overall, this small-scale human perspective of the war is an excellent way of not only retelling an important time in history, but also producing a heartfelt story that resonates with you for a long time after completion."

This game certainly captured the emotions of war exceptionally well. It's actually one of the better games I've played recently. I'd definitely recommend this game; it's worth the $15!"
