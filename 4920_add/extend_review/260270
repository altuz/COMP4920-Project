,Recommended,260270,12413479,"Posted: 8 October, 2014",all,BridgetFisher,"A spooktacular game of mystery and evil perfect for halloween.  Those new to mystery games will find themselves hitting the hint button alot, though the game is friendly to new players since any puzzle can be skipped or the hint button can be hit if stuck.  Cant get lost because there is a map highlighting where an object of importance is to continue the story.The Hidden Object Puzzles can be very difficult, there are things that can be moved on screen in the puzzles, meaning you just need to click everything to see what moves if there is an item behind it since there is no cursor change.  Due to the games age many objects are difficult to spot due to them being very small or the detail is so low they cant be clearly seen.  During puzzles it may ask to find a heart, or a knife, but there will be tons of hearts or knives meaning finding some arbitrary one.  Other times objects are just named wrong such as saying ""darts"" but there are none instead there is a dartboard you click instead.There are not many full on Halloween games on steam so this is worth trick or treating it up.Rating:  7/10  Value:  $2.99"

While Dylan is taking a phone call from her concerned mother all her friends are sucked in the Jumanji-like game board.  (I personally do not think Miss Disgruntled (Dylan's girlfriend, Samantha) actually realized the game board was haunted by the ghosts of a previous tragedy.  The ""haunted"" gameboard simply recognized similiar natures, and history repeats.)  Simple enough storyline.NOTE:  I really like the opening where the car headlights light up the pumpkin from behind before the car is seen and drives past.NOTE 2 - Safety announcment: Please do not talk on your cell phone while driving even if it is your mom calling.Of all the reviews I read, good and bad, after I played the game I only have this to say: This is an old school Hidden Object game.  This is how they all used to be when actual storylines were first being introduced and being refined.  The games centered on the Hidden Object scenes, with the occassional pick up of inventory items to be used later or to solve some puzzle.  The games were not as strictly linear as they are now, but had a more ""open world"" feel with ""bottle necks"".  The games were also not nearly as ""hand-holding"" as they are now.  The gamer had to think and OMG guess about what had to done, plus click everywhere.  Yes it was and is annoying and frustrating but that is partly what made the game challenging, out thinking the game/developers.Being a fool for old school this was a really refreshing game for me to play.  Very different puzzles and needing a completely different mind set compared to more recent and HD graphic ""hand-holding"" games of today.  One of the complaints centered on the half-completed objects in the hidden object scenes.  Well all I can say to that is you got what you clicked (Do remember this game was made before 3D was standard, so the objects were drawn in, not overlayed.)The actual puzzles of this game include suduko, logic, slide, matching, ""minesweeper"" among many other types.  This game includes a vast and usually unseen variety of puzzles compared to the color, sound, and match fare of today.  So no crying about how hard the puzzles are, expand your repertorie.If you want a challenging game and are bored with the standard fare of today, try yesteryear (in game time 2 years is like 2 centuries).  This game overall is quite challenging.  No penalties for hints which I had almost forgotten about being so used to today's games where there are penalties for hints, map use, and misclicks.  Hints were standard fare in old school and the gamer was expected to use the hint button... a lot, as well as be click ""happy"".  Guides and YouTube did not exist then like they do now.Old school games did not have (or require) achievements, in-game or later the all important steam achievements.  They especially did not require trading cards to even be considered playable.  So if as a gamer one is looking for those things, this game has none of that.  So welcome to the adult version of ""Highlights"" and enjoy what made the games of today what they are today."

It’s far from being the worst hidden object title on Steam, but even further of being the best.Long version:Shadows: Price of Our Sins had a really sound idea behind it: a hidden object puzzle game featuring a ghost story about witchcraft, love, betrayal and tragedy. It’s the execution that suffers.The game has no voiceover after the intro, so everything is told in large– and frankly, very boring– text dumps. Also, the main plot seen at the beginning pretty much disappears, and never gets a proper resolution: after solving the final puzzle, it just… stops.The puzzles range from bad to above average. They are also repetitive, with an uncomforting emphasis on colour puzzles. Despite this it is recommended to play it on an easier difficulty, since they follow little logic: key items just turn up abruptly in the most unexpected places.The graphic style fits well to the atmosphere, but it is also quite dated, which really shows in the meticulous pixel hunting of the hidden object scenes."

However......I did experience multiple technical/gameplay issues including; game regularly required multiple launch attempts before playing, wouldn't reset my display from game resolution to my normal resolution after exiting (I had to do so manually after each session), no video (audio only) for second cutscene, one crash (w/o any progress loss), inconsistent mouseover behavior in hidden object puzzles for multi-step items, one hidden object item misspelling, and a couple hidden object items with active area in a different location than image. I was playing this on Linux Mint 18 (Wine/PlayOnLinux). But I play a lot of Windows only games on this OS and rarely encounter this number/variety of issues. That being said......I didn't find those issues all that distracting given the positives this game has to offer; good graphics, decent art, good story, plenty of game, above average hidden object game difficulty, decent voice acting, and a map with current location - next available action - and quick transport. If it had played without the issues, I wouldn't hesitate in giving it a straightforward recommend. But as it is, I recommend getting it on sales to help make up for the issues it does have.PS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review. So Steam only shows that I played 0.1 hrs as of the time of this review, although I've played at least 6 hrs and have completed the game."
,Recommended,260270,25879417,"Posted: 5 October, 2016",all,Betelgeuse,"Normally I don't go for hidden object-type games, but the Halloween theme of this one drew me in. As it turns out the game is surprisingly well-made for this genre. It's more like a point-and-click adventure game; and not just finding hidden objects. The hidden objects were kind of annoying to look for, but I found the other puzzles to be much more enjoyable. Every classic puzzle is represented here and some are actually quite challenging.You'll spend your time traversing a gameworld of beautifully-crafted backgrounds and artwork (and some nicely-rendered cutscenes), meeting ghosts and helping them find lost artifacts. The end goal being to save your friends who were trapped inside a supernatural board game on Halloween night. You will unlock many areas and learn more about the story. I was genuinely surprised at how deep the story was and how long the game turned out to be. I expected a few rooms to explore at the most. There are a high number of rooms to visit and the map allows you to quick-travel between each discovered location. Places such as a house, church, cemetery, barn, greenhouse, seashore etc. can seem overwhelming for a small game; but they all tie neatly together to unravel a much longer story than originally anticipated.The atmosphere and aesthetic style of this game is perfect for playing on All Hallows' Eve or any October night. I highly recommend it!"

(Example: an item was hidden behind the top of a barrel, and there was no indication it was there; I don't think you even needed to use a crowbar or hammer or anything, so there were no clues to its location at all.)It got to feel so long that, towards the end, I just stopped caring much about saving my friends and just wanted to be done with the game.  That said, I did find it interesting until that point!"

There's a notice on the game's Library page dated from August 24th letting people know about problems with Windows 10, video drivers, and cutscenes.  I'm trying to run it under Windows 10 with the lastest Nvidia drivers and after the first couple of cutscenes, ended up with the problem (just a blank, black screen during the cutscene).  There doesn't seem to be a fix for this yet.  Along with that, in the two cutscenes I was able to see, the voice volume was inaudible.  I think the cutscene volume might be tied to the music volume slider in the options (since I had that turned off), but can't really check it any more.  Also, on a game-related note, just after the start, I was totally stuck.  It turns out I had totry to drive away from the area first.  Of course, I'd never have thought of that, since I'm playing a game and actually want to BE there and figure out what's going on.I'll update this when I try to run it again."

The plot was great, the scenes were good,  the games were great, the hidden objects were good, the dialogue was good, it lasted long enough,  I enjoyed every minute of the 10 hours or so it took to get through it.  I've read some other reviews that complained they had problems with finding the hidden objects and other things, so I wonder if they've played this type as much as I, as I found it fairly typical, if not better, of this genre.  I thought the storyline was especially good. I think I'll quit reading reviews.  They often cause me to not buy a game, yet when I do,  9 times out of 10 I disagree with their critiques.  I guess haters got to hate."

Sure, the game is a bit old (obvious by the graphics and t he aspect ratio), but I was still willing to enjoy it. Sadly, this game did not run properly for me. I read the reviews and found that I'm not alone. Many have noted that the game doesn't run properly on Windows 10. Perhaps this is the problem. I got past the opening cinematics, but items picked up would just disappear, meaning the game is unplayable for me. You need inventory items to progress, but my inventory wouldn't go beyond the first two items. What a shame."

The story is engaging and definitely unique, the voice acting (what little there is) decent, and despite its flaws and rough spots, I had a very fun time playing this.Overall it's a very good game, it just could have used a little more polish before being put up for sale. In particular someone going over the HOGs and making sure there wasn't duplicate items (i'm serious, it is very frustrating for 'star' to be on the list and finding THREE items that match that) and otherwise tightening up the writing."

I've gotten into HOPA games over the last year, and haven't really had any technical problems with any of them.  But in this game the cutscenes don't play properly.  There is sound, but no video.  I found many other reports on the bigfish forums.  My drivers are up to date and the computer exceeds minimum requirements.  The first cutscene played properly, the 2nd, which sets up the whole story, does not.  I switched to playing in a window and started the game again.  The 2nd cutscene played this time, but the 3rd had no video.  If I could, I'd refund.Otherwise, from the very short time I played, it looked like a perfectly competent HOPA game."

However, just coming off of playing a few other HOGs, I didn't feel like the graphics were as good as some of the other options, it was more buggy, and the puzzles went from ""Could be done by a 2 year old"" to ""WHAT EVEN"". There were a few puzzles that the instructions were VERY misleading or just outright wrong, some of the hidden object scenes have mutiples of the hidden objects you are looking for, and there are some typos. The story is kind of dumb, but I'm mostly just annoyed with how abruptly it ended.  I can't say I see myself replaying it, but I did kind of enjoy it.

The story is kind of weird and the puzzles are interesting. I do have some caveats, however.I played it in casual mode, which meant that sparklies appeared near clickable items even in hidden object games. This is unusual and was actually annoying because I felt I didn't even get a decent chance to find objects without seeing a hint indicator. The game is very inconsistent in indicating what can be clicked on. Sometimes there's a sparkle nearby, sometimes the cursor animates when over a cilckable object, and sometimes there's no indication whatsoever that something can be clicked on. This last  thing often led to me scratching my head over some HOGs because I didn't realize I was supposed to turn a page or move something out of the way.Puzzle rules are not always accurate. For example, one matching puzzle said the color had to match, but it didn't. Sometimes a HOG contained multiple objects that matched a clue, so the only way to find the correct object was to click on each of them. Sometimes a clue made no sense for the object it referred to. (Example: ""excavator bucket"" meant the Big Dipper constellation.) There is no bonus material.Even with all these complaints, I generally enjoyed the game and marginally recommend it if you're looking for yet another game of this type to play. Expect 6-7 hours of play. Make sure you get it on sale."
