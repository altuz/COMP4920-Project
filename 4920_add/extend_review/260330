,Not Recommended,260330,17180084,"Posted: 22 July, 2015",all,Coaldust,"Despite appearances Flockers does not play much like Lemmings.Lemmings is primarily a puzzle game, not an action game.  Flockers is primarily an action game, not a puzzle game.  The difference is whether you put the emphasis on difficult reasoning or reacting quickly.Flockers plays more like some sort of strange platformer than a Lemmings clone.  Unlike Lemmings, there is no way to assign tasks while the game is paused or even slowed down.Assigning tasks is made more unpleasant by the design of flocker tasks.  In Lemmings assigning a single lemming a task typically affected the behavior of the entire stream of lemmings, or terrain, such as blocking their path and turning them around, or building a staircase until an obstacle was struck.  In Flockers you usually need to give the same task to each flocker at the right time.  Too late is fatal.  Too early may also be fatal, depending on the task and environment.  The only concession the controls make for these demands is to allow you to use a larger or smaller 'brush' to assign tasks, and due to the timing constraints a large brush is not very usable.To make matters worse, there is no way to predict what the level elements will do.  This reduces solving the level to trial and error, rather than planning.The constant trial and error gameplay is grueling since you will need to start the entire level over if you  mess up badly enough.If you want to see what it would be like to play Super Mario Bros. with awkward controls, a stream of Marios, and random cheap deaths, then play this.  If you want to play something like Lemmings, you need to look elsewhere.Some are making comparisons to Worms as well.  There certainly is no similarity between Worms and Flockers gameplay.  Both Lemmings and Worms had destructable environments.  Flockers does not.  While Worms was violent, and Lemmings had a task that made all the lemmings blow themselves up (used to restart the level), the violence was cartoony.  Flockers is gory.  So Flockers is not very comparable to Worms either."
,Recommended,260330,17286234,"Posted: 29 July, 2015",all,Strategikal,"Flockers is an action puzzle game in much the same style as Lemmings, created by Team17, makers of Worms, so you know the pedigree is good.https://youtu.be/YQXgOCYvZFgFor those who don't remember the classic Lemmings, it was a game in which a number of ""lemmings"" (which looked more like human workers to me) were released and would walk through the landscape, following each other like the archetypal lemmings, blindly walking off cliffs to their death. Your job as the player was to guide the lemmings by giving specific instructions to them, for example to build bridges or dig into the landscape, in order to guide as many of them to safety as possible.Flockers uses essentially the same concept, but with sheep instead of lemmings. Appropriately so, since sheep also have the habit of following one another. This time around, rather than natural landscapes, you have to help them navigate through extremely dangerous factory complexes, filled with saws, spikes, hammers and other nasty objects, often with gory results as your mindless sheep stroll blindly into them.Each level is a puzzle. They're large, and get progressively more complicated as you progress through them. You can zoom in and out to get a better view of the puzzle you have to solve. Sheep may wander off in different directions, you may meet more sheep along the way, transporters teleport sheep to different locations and it can sometimes be a bit confusing to understand what's going on the first time you try a new level.As you go through each level, sheep step on buttons which activate machinery, sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a very bad way, so you have to be very careful what you let them step on. They also encounter crates, which when opened give you new abilities that you can assign to your your sheep. It may take a few attempts to figure out how to get through a level.While you often need to get only one sheep to safety (in the early levels at least), getting more will score you more points, as will doing it in a faster time. You also get a bonus for using fewer abilities. You can retry levels to get a better score, and you can compare your score to your friends.The levels are very detailed, perhaps overly so, which can make it tricky to figure out how to solve them. But maybe that's the point, distracting you with unimportant details. Fortunately, although it's an action game, you can pause it at any time, giving you the opportunity to study the puzzle at your leisure. You still have to solve it in real time though, giving commands to your sheep as they move. Pressing the right mouse button gives you a bigger ""brush"", enabling you to give commands to multiple sheep at the same time.The graphics are very good, and very gory as sheep get smashed and sawed, spiked and gored, with blood splattering everywhere, which is rather amusing if you find that sort of thing funny. For this reason the game has an age rating. But if you don't like that sort of thing, you can simply turn off the gore in the video options.I haven't played this game for very long yet, but my first impressions are very good. I'm finding it both challenging and amusing, an enjoyable casual way to pass the time. The price is very reasonable and it's on sale at the moment, so this is a great time to grab it if you're interested."

Can be as gory or non-bloody if you so choose. The new environmental aspects are great, Tellaporters, gravity reversal, mines, sharp bone blades and, Worms driving Death Machines with saw blades and spikes ready to take out your flock without hesitation. Guide your Flock of sheep through the map using ability box's you either start with or pick up along the way, to the trumpet looking exit vacuum. Making sure to do it as quickly as possible without losing too many of your sheep. Sacrifices are usually a necessity, except for rounds where you only have 1 sheep. Knowing that this game is still in Early Access stage, it's one of the best functioning ""Alpha's"" I've played in quite awhile.The only thing I have issue with is moving the camera around. There are times when you move or Pan the camera up, down, left, or right it becomes semi choppy and can be difficult to get the camera where you want it without taking extra time to adjust. I'm pretty sure the DEV's are aware of this issue and are working on it.Visually this game is very appealing, Content is still being added, and it even comes with a level editor and, Twitch Streaming features in game.  Other than more levels, and perhaps more Hazards to navigate, you can't really ask for much more.  I wish more early access projects were this ""completed"" upon steam early access release.As it stands, as long as the DEV's don't introduce and major game breaking issues in the future updates, this is a Great Game worth every penny.  Would and will recommend to friends."

Though, being 12 at the time, its not a huge accomplishment in and of itself, but I remember most of the puzzles being pretty damn ruthless and you could usually just and just sneak one single lemming out. Then you had to continue for bunch of levels with increasing difficulty to get those small snickers out.Flockers basically feels really nice. It usually seems to have an easy setting to get minimum sheeps out, and then have an extra challenge to really cross the rules."

The graphics are muddy and ugly. Well, it's understandable, cause you're in a butcher factory or whatever, but I mean they're really detracting from the actual gameplay. The camera is sluggish. The game runs poorly on a modern rig and the overall gameplay is just not satisfying enough to carry it forward.Your task, just as in lemmings, is to guide as many sheep to the exit, while sacrificing some on the way. For that you have various tools. Sorry, did I say various tools? Nah. Actually there are only 3 (jumping sheep, flying sheep and exploding sheep). The rest of the kit consists of ""blocks"", i.e. your sheep can be used as stepping stones (1, 2 or 3) like a staircase or as a soft block (2 sheep high), which means only flying sheep can cross over that. You can also release your sheep from stair or blocking duty. That is it. That is the game. At least that's what it's been for the first 10 or so levels. You get access to all the tools from the start.To actually use these blocks you have to gather them in the level. The levels consist of different traps and teleporters, walls and gaps. Honestly, it's again, boring. There's nothing to really differentiate the levels from each other. They look and feel the same. Maybe this gets better later on, but if your game doesn't progress anywhere after 1 hour it's not worth my time anymore. There are also boss levels...the first one is you being chased by a giant ""something"" on wheels. Your sheep will die...horribly...and bloodily. And I guess this is the main selling point of the game. Since it is enough to get even a single sheep through to beat the level there's not much strategy involved, unless you want to go score attack...which with the amount of levels in there (a ton) sounds like work and not fun.The controls are also kinda wonky, especially since you can't use the pause mode to actually plan stuff. In Lemmings you could assign individual lemmings to important roles. Here it's more like ""paste that♥♥♥♥♥♥over every sheep to make them fly"". Personally, I find this game to be dull and dreary. Maybe get it at a steep discount. 18 bucks is way too much for the level of polish you get here, though it does offer a decent amount of levels. Too bad the levels aren't interesting."
