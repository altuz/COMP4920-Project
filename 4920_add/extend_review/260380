76561197995422896,Not Recommended,260380,9221209,"Posted: 22 February, 2014",all,Chicken,"Ninja Cats vs Samurai Dogs is horrifically ported across and not even a good strategy/tower defense game either.The game doesn't explain itself well and the tips it does offer it directs you to a forum post on the official forum for the game, which it alt tabs you from the game. When you do return back to the game it either crashes the game or puts it into windowed mode and guess what the options menu doesn't give you the option to go full screen again. Talking about the option menu, it's awful it has a sound option and how long you've been playing thats it. No resolution, no key bindings nothing just turning up or turning down the sound, I don't know what genius thought ""This'll do"". Don't press esc or the game will turn itself off no confirmation just boom off. The achievements are bugged it doesn't tell you when you get achievements and when you try to look at what achievements you do have it just gives a list of the all the achievements but with no breakdown as to what you have and what you're missing.The gameplay is basically a 5 lane system, where you send your respective animal (cat or dog) down the lane of your choice to try and get to the end of the enemies lane and destroy their building that they have put in that spot. Obviously the CPU does the same as well to try and attempt to beat you. There are 4 different classes standard type soldier, archer, cavalry and artillery, they each have there own strengths and weaknessses for you to figure out which lane to put them down to be most effective(If you think this is a standout great feature on a strategy game, you're a moron).You also have traps and spells and other smaller bits. Whilst playing I find myself questioning though where the CPU gets the funds to build some of the stuff they have as im scraping soldiers together and it sends them out in droves as well as littering the field with traps.Even 2 hours into the game im really struggling, I'm not a beginner at tower defense games but the learning curve on this game is appalling. The tutorial is lacklustre as well teaching you the very basics and then not really following through with further lessons as you unlock more items. It has a talent tree which is supposed to add some sort of depth (again if you think this talent tree is good you're a moron, even WoW has a better one and Blizzard destroyed characters talent trees like a year ago) but really all it is, is for you to use extra stuff in battles the problem is you need this stuff in the beginning of the game so effectively you have to grind losses and the occasional win to get experience to unlock the skills you need.Yes the game is cheap but so are other better games, you can even go on trading sites to swap TF2 keys for better games for a cheaper price. Don't make the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t excuse of it's good value for money, a happy meal is good value for money doesn't mean its worth buying because of what it will do to your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the next day. Don't buy this or game or do its your money this is just what I think about the game."

So if you dislike these games, just avoid this one. Now for anyone else who wants a review for this game let me continue on:This is a lovely little game. I really like it. First of all, it's just simple Tower Defence. So imagine a lot of gameplay style like Plants vs Zombies and Ironclad Tactics. You build certain building, you deploy units and they fight with the enemy. Each unit has his strong and weak point, like I said simple Tower Defence. So if you like these kind of games. You're on the right track.Next thing I wanna adress are the graphics and the sound/music. Don't expect anything fancy here, again it's a mobile port so you have to work with that. Yet I have to say the graphics suprise me very well. Both the cats and the dogs have very good looking sprites and the units are easy to reconigize. Also the music is what really sells me in this game. Remember Okami or Okamiden? Well that kind of music is what you are gonna get in this game, it really helps to strengthen the mood.So anybody looking for a fancy story? Well, I have to hold you there. Nothing to big of a story here. Also the controls are still set to the phone version, so swipe and wipes are expected to happen. One note I have to attach to that one is, that in some cases that might cause slight problems with Windows 8. But you can work around that.I would really recommend this game to people who loved Plants vs Zombies or Ironclad Tactics."

For those who get this game and find that you've an issue running it, find the game folder in steam, and run the app from there. You will need steam running, but this by-passed my  issue. I thank daveh667 for that help. Now, I have actually gotten to play the game. It isn't a hard game to get the feel of how it works. It does however, throw some truely wicked curves at you on some maps. Also, I can't help but enjoy watching cats and dogs do epic battle. Anyways, I wasn't disappointed with getting this game. it certainly had me thinking of new and better ways to try and defeat the rival faction. if you like strategy, or just like dogs and/or cats, do check this game out."

,Not Recommended,260380,9235490,"Posted: 23 February, 2014",all,Firellius (Aurel),"Godawful game. The concept is simple, I have no problems with that, but just beyond the tutorial, games are already impossible to win due to unfair additional bonuses conveyed to the enemy team. Do not buy, even at 3 euros it's not worth it."

76561198040951329,Recommended,260380,9227903,"Posted: 22 February, 2014",all,VbHD,"Ok so no one seemed to be able to write anything up on this without seeming like a troll so here goes.Game clearly is a port, it does have limitations, virtually no settings available apart from sound controls, ALT tabbing will take the game out of fullscreen (easily fixed by pressing ALT Enter afterwards), keybindings are locked (although this does not matter because the game is easy to control by default), and pressing ESC at any time will close the game immediately.Theres the bad part, clearly not a huge amount of effort went into porting it, but its still playable.The Good part, the tactics are reasonably deep, the game is not easy, comes with a fairly complicated advancement tree and from what I can see so far, quite a few missions. The tutorial explains everything in a natural way that is easy to learn, but hard to master.Also, to the people complaining about the requests for the player to 'swipe' over a building, saying that this is impossible for a PC, they are idiots, who did not actually attempt to simply drag their mouse from left to right using the left mouse button. That is what swiping means, and despite the general lack of features, swiping works just fine.Overall for this towerdefence genre, given its price at about 3-4 USD, this game is easily worth your time."

It is in the options.- The ONLY con I have encountered thus far is a personal preference:When you pick up a new card that was just created, it automatically wants you to play it to the battlefield. This is incredibly annoying as sometimes I want to pick up cards just so I can get the next ones going.I do not see an easy way around this, since you must pick and choose which cards you will throw into your inventory and then use. Also, if the card went to your inventory and then you needed to click it again, I am positive people would complain about the extra click. I can see where this would be a great benefit in the app version, but on PC the extra click is meaningless.Currently I hit the ghost level as a brick wall and will most likely need to go down one of the other paths.The art and music gives one the Ninja/Samurai immersion, well done."

,Recommended,260380,9295355,"Posted: 28 February, 2014",all,UnbatedCreature,This remarkable game set my teasers to a tizzle. It's similar to plants vs. zombies but insted of zombies and plants and a drugful and syramic base god with a pot for a brain.  Its CatsvDogs in this insane battle royal of the dominat human toy. You can play as the dog and fight the will of peanut butter on certain items in the game. Or cat where you spend 90% of your time standing still and then running in the name of the lord. (John wood of course). I decided to say neither and mod the game so I can play as bill cosby. Yeah . . Bill Cosby.

With it's mobile like ""CLICK ALL THE THINGS"", it makes it a bit difficult unless you have a sensitive mouse. If you're not a fan of mobile games, don't buy it, but if you like games common to the famous flash game ""1942"", do enjoy this game. If features many things to do aside from just play levels, if features side quests and even keeps score on wins and loses on most levels."
