,Not Recommended,260430,16537089,"Posted: 19 June, 2015",all,PigBear,"UPDATE::: The devs have seen it fit to immediately ban me from their discusson board after this review was posted. For that I warn folks who have issues to be careful speaking up. Seems this Dev likes their dirty tricks when they don't want their filthy laundry aired out.This is my final review edit. After enough time with four kings, I have decided they have completely lost touch with the fanbase who supported them from day one. Just as they did on playstion home for six long years.Im going to be honest here, I'm not liking the way things are going. I thought after they had their time with playstation home, we'd see changes that showed they learned their lesson last time from customer feedback.I remember a time when DL had a casino on ps home, it was an avitar social world with literally hundreds of mini games and places to chat and play. Game themed rooms and more. They also had a casino there and they did the same thing with chips there. The games there were PLAUGED with bugs and cheaters, very little was done. However they had no issue releasing an apartment for over 50 dollars that came with the same games you already had access to in their casino and they REFUSED to change the pricing even with such negative feedback. Oh and might I add, the people who were stupid enough to buy it lost those items anyway when ps home closed it's doors this past march.People lost thousands of chips with no rembursement, and the tournaments were a joke. You had to pay 4.99 for a tournament bracelet with no guarantee of any reward. Just a pat on the back for those who didnt make the cut, while they pocketed their real money.I was much happier with this game during EA. Now? Theyre making the game completely un fun by catering to the new players they want to spend money. Bingo nerfs are beyond terrible.Im now seated at a progressive game with over 25 players. The pot would usually be over 100k. It isn't even breaking 40k right now...and rp payouts are the same as the main floor games.The people who bought in during early access are being pushed away to cater to the casual player with a spending problem.I have taken a break from four kings and returned today to see if the nerfs were truly as bad as they say, I'm unhappy to report they are far worse than what players are complaining about. I remember sitting at bingo for hours, and not having this back of luck either. One could say it comes and it goes, but this is just ridiculous.I was quick to respond to a gent who made a post on how this game is not only exploiting potential gambling addicts, but nothing more than a cash grab. I really would like to recall that person's username, so I can apologize and say they might be right.Because the players who bought into this game and made is possible for it to even make it out of early access are being disregarded. If this is what developers plan to do to people who buy into their games in order to support a title, I am swearing off EA games entirely. Because this seems to be a NASTY habit with devs on here. They bend over backwards during EA, but after they get your money all bets are off."

If  like me you were looking for a fun  way to pretend to  gamble then  do not buy this game because once out of Early Access it could end up costing you a lot of money if you continue to play the game.  During Early Access you can earn small amounts of chips  (usually  25 chips at a time) for doing   several things like visiting certain area's of the casino, plus you can earn the same number of  chips  for every 15 minutes you spend in game.  When you  enter the Casino after purchasing the game you  are given 1000 chips.My first love is  slots, so  I casually ran over to the slots and   after 10 spins  I'd spent  virtually all of my chips.   Thankfully, during the  Early Acess phase you can get more chips for   very little money; i.e.  there are several selections ranging from 500 chips to 40 000 chips each one of which  costs you $0.01 to purchase. This amount is deducted from your Steam wallet.   Once early access is over these will undoubtably change and cost much more.  Sadly, like any gambling den, the odds are always stacked against you.After the 10 turns on the  slots, with virtually no chips left  and not wanting to wait around for  almost an hour before I could get  a couple  more spins, I left, then rejoined the following day because I was under the impression that during Early Access we would be given   1000 chips every  day, but this was not the case (I purchased the  basic game plus the cheaper of the dlc's, (costing me a total of just over £16).I don't know whether   you can or will be able to convert  any winnings  to  real money, but even if you were, it's only a  lucky few that would ever manage to get any real money back.Personally I'm really disappointed with this game.  I was  hoping to be able to play a wide range of different slot machines,  but there was little  variety to be found, plus until I decided to buy the  highest  slection of chips I only had enough for two spins and  four goes on the roulette table (which has a minimum bet of 10 chips).Part way through my second visit there was a server reboot.  I was given literally a  minute's warning in which I was asked to log off.  As I was part way through a gamble  when this occured I wasn't    pleased.Despite it being in Early Access, so by definition  not a completed game, I can't recommend this game to anyone but   hardened gamblers."
,Recommended,260430,16111131,"Posted: 31 May, 2015",all,Uncle Dan,"This game is probably one of the easiest games I've found to just hop on for an hour or so a day and just have some fun.The game is fairly well optimised after one of the latest patches, the game is now most certainly where it needs to be in terms of performace.The gameplay is so reliable and enjoyable, the only downside as many have said is the slots. Slots is the easiest game to sink money and time into and the current machine is rather lackluster. I'm aware a new machine is on it's way and that's what I'm most excited for.There is some issues with the games UI still and quite a few issues regarding the VIP system and everything relating that is rather confusing and not very well explained.The customisation of the characters is very strong and enjoyable, there is a lot of options regarding your style and the currency to buy items is a little hard to get however it's very rewarding when you finally get the item you have wanted.My biggest gripe is the VIP system and that is runs on a server based clock and if you manage to get VIP one day before the end of the month you get it for only that one day, then when the reset rolls around it clocks you back to normal status.Even if you purchased one of the dlc packs for a month of VIP it resets you to normal status when the monthly reset happens - so if you purchase it at a bad time you could only get 5 days of VIP or however long untill the month changes.This is a game I have been waiting for, and for a very long time. I am so glad it has finally come and it is so enjoyable. The updates are frequent however often not many new features as there is a lot of work to be done on the backend of the game and the new games etc take a very long time to produce.The payouts are balance, the game is fun, and the servers are fast.A great game in my opinion and I'm glad I bought into the beta before it went F2P because I got so much out of it. A must buy for any gambling enthusiast or card guys."

If you don't understand how to play some casino games it provides detailed instructions at the table. I played it for the first week it came out and have found myself striving to compete with friends to top the leader boards.

I spoke with one of the developers today and I can truly say they are putting in their best efforts to improve this game. An update is being installed as I type. I entered the casino and I must say, everything is quite self-explanatory. After playing a few spins on the roulette table I ran into a member of the dev-team and had a nice conversation. I have been looking for a game like this for AAAGES. But two weeks ago I searched yet again for a decent casino game on steam, and only a bit later, this comes out. It is truly amazing and heading in the good direction.Yes, there may be bugs and things may not be as ""smooth"" as one would like, but keep in mind that this game is still in development. I bought the all-in package and I am glad I did. I wonder if it will be ever possible to turn your 'earnings' into real money, since you can buy additional chips in the game with real currency. Anyway this game is really a must-have if you love gambling. This is the first time I have ever written a decent review on a steam game. On a game in general, I think. But let me tell you once again: It. Is. Worth. It. The variety of games to play is good. There's blackjack, single-deck 21, craps, keno, hold 'em poker, roulette, PuntoBanco/Baccarat, slot machines and some kind of ""Wheel of fortune"". There is also a VIP-area which allows you to play at tables with higher stakes, which makes it possible to either win more - or loose more - being able to change your bet more to your liking. You can also sit on a bench and do some emotes while talking, this adds to the real-life atmosphere.I will keep a close eye on the development of this game!>went to blackjack table> bet $1.000>Double down at 16>5>2110/10 would double down again on high numbers."

If it didn't even say it was early access, I wouldn't have even known that it was.Good points:- Has a nice atmosphere, really feels like a nice place to hang out- Gameplay is smooth- Control/movement is great- Blackjack- The community who play regularly are really niceImprovement suggestions:- Avatar customisation is lacking- Lack of people to talk to (will improve with popularity hopefully!)- Lack of people to play Poker with- Chat/messaging system is a slightly buggyIf you're looking for a great casino game, this is the one.

Mostly it's great for testing any gambling theories out, before going to a real casino and trying with real money.  This game doesn't require you to spend any real money AT ALL. and it has pretty much EVERY casino game out there.  If you run out of money you (can) buy more, or you can just wait a little bit, do some side mission type thing, or wait until tomorrow to get some more play money.  So this developer makes real money of actual desperate gamblers that spend real cash in order to top leader boards or buy cool clothes or whatever. But if you just want to try certain strategies before using real money on them, this is the perfect game for that!"

Most typical casino games are present and the play style is that of an mmo with customizable avatars ect allowing you to navigate the realistic virtual casino setting and join the different games as you choose. Gameplay is very similar to the Digital Leisure casino that was part of playstation home, for those that played that, only graphically better. Bugs have been minimal over the several hours I've played so far and the game is pretty polished for the first few days of early access beta. I would definitely recommend this game for casual players who enjoy both casino style gaming and social mmo type game mechanics. My only caveat is that this game is not strictly a free to play game, but after its offical launch will be a microtransaction model wherein you have the option of  purchasing additional casino chips to augment or replenish your current holdings. As with any game of this nature the inherent cost will depend on what you decide to spend, so amongst those gamers who inexplicably expect to enjoy playing polished multiplayer games without having to financially support them I'm sure there will be complaining."

All the games are very generic, without any of the themes or personality that make casinos fun.The poker room is pretty disappointing, and I don't see any sign in the early access notes of there being plans for any sort of major overhaul here. It's not at all like an actual casino poker room, and seems like it's been designed by someone who doesn't know much about poker. There is no cash games, only sit-and-go style tournaments with extremely fast blind levels that tend to turn the game into an all-in festival within minutes. There is no variety in games. The tables don't even have enough seats for a typical casino poker game. The poker setup seems geared toward getting games over with as quickly as possible."

I can't contune with my review because after it's offical release, the game has become nothing but a laggy mess. You're sure to lose your chips if this happens whilst you're on a table. Even for free (or paid for in my case, and I stil maintain it never mentioned it was going to be free once it hit 1.0 during it's first days of release on Early Access), it is a game breaking flaw."

Chips are WAY overpriced, there's only two poker tables total (!!!), the poker blinds go up super fast, rampant bugs, people losing chips they paid real money for (the devs are doing refunds but still- it shouldn't happen at all).The devs need to switch away from their income coming from chip sales, and more towards the cosmetics or something. The payment model as it is is NOT going to work. There is a solid game here, but it needs changes. Play some for free if you want, but I wouldn't suggest investing at this point. Changing my review to a 'no'. Sorry devs, but it's a mess right now.Everything below is only left for posterity, you can ignore it as it is completely outdated info_______________________edit 5/12/2015: Apparently the game has gone free now, just a few days after I purchased it. Bad timing on my part aside: The game now has a decent population going, and there's definitely no reason to not recommend picking it up, since it's free!Very solid game- the only real complaint I have is that poker blinds go up waaay too fast, but the devs have said they're looking into it._______________________________Since it is simply ""YES"" or ""NO"", I'm going ""YES"" here. But that's not really how I feel about it.There is a great, functional core here. But the game is empty. Very empty. In two hours I've seen a total of 5 other players, all but one of them were just at a slot machine and unresponsive to greetings. At some point, once there's some sort of population, I think this will be a great game. Right now I don't really see a reason to reccommend buying it."

Ok. I bought it. Since a VERY LONG time waiting for something similar Reel Deal Slots in Steam. And cause I'm a fan of this genre of games.And I was very disappointed... the presence of early access in no way justifies an EXTREMELY UGLY BLOCKY graphics. Many games of this genre 15 years ago looked much better than this game. Halls, which is nearly the same as each other are no different and artificially stretched by placing the same machine 10 pieces in a row. Only 1 kind of horrible slot machine (seriously???) without interesting bonus and the possibility of doubling (on mobile devices, in F2P games - slots which made on a much more decent level - hundreds). Video poker without the doubling possibility and other games made on the most primitive level without interesting variations. And I doubt very much that at least some of these problems will be fixed with the release.Including a full absence of people in the lobby. I can't even give out my VIP invitations to friends in Steam, cause the VIP-invitation system not working at the moment.Not to mention the fact that my first acquaintance with the game began with an immediate disconnect from server after logging into the system and inability to reconnect quite a long time, resulting to log into the game I was only able the next day."

Energy - I think an empty casino is one of the sadder places your can visit in real life. Add NPC's, add dealers, add a background chatter track for ambiance. Something, anything.2. I enjoy the multitues of slot machines in a real casino. There was only one type in the whole place. It was slow (no stop, made me watch the money counter before next spin) and unexciting (few bonus features). I think the pay lines were drawn in MS paint by a traveling hobo, but I'll forgive that in early access ;)3. My bets were capped very low on all games. Gifted starting cash was 40k. Max bet royal flush WIN on jacks or better also 40k. Something is off here. The element of ""Big Win!"" seemed to be lacking? If bet size is scaled by wallet or EXP, I still need to be incentivized to make it that far. The remote possibility of a HUGE win can greatly help with this element.##Here's what I liked1. Ability to walk around in avatar form2. Architecturally sound; casino pleasing to the eye3. Lots and lots of potential! I will check back frequently to have a look at the updates. The devs are apparently very active. I look forward to writing an overwhelmingly positive & encouraging review for this game at some point.4. No learning curve. Load, play, win (maybe)5.

In all seriousness, Four Kings Casino is a interesting title that is very similar to the PS Home Casino. The developers are really nice and interactive. Slot and table games are very fun and fast. Why am I not recommending this game then? Here's why:BJ and roulette completely lack excitement since the betting limit is under 0.5% of your start money. It's really hard to play poker when there's barely anyone online to play with and when there is they won't want to play with you. There's a VIP area which requires you to play approx. 30h/month to gain and maintain your VIP membership unless if you pay for it.This game needs a lot of work still before it's ready for a release. For now: DON'T BUY THIS GAME! Play at a real online casino! Obviously the lack of players isn't the developers fault but there are many issues that they should fix.TL;DR: Nobody is online, betting limits are WAY TOO low. Don't buy this game unless you're dying for a casino game on Steam."
