Simulating takes an insane amount of time even if you reduce the number of tournaments. You'll spend more time waiting time to flow than acutally managing your team which makes it quite a pain. Also, there are some bugs and unfinished features like the one where you can remove tournaments but the game will still load them from the menu and give an error message if you chose them. And since there is no sign of an update, I'm glad it was on sale when I bought it cause in it's curent state, it isn't worth 10 bucks."

If you really like basketball and/or other games in the genre such as Football Manager, then you will like this game. It doesn't offer a lot graphically, but it is very detailed as far as managing a team and using analytics to create the best team possible. It can be very difficult, but you can turn the difficulty settings down before launching the game. Buy this if you want a deeply detailed basketball management experience and don't mind that it runs pretty much like a browser game. I have a longer review available on Corrupted Cartridge."

Instead, you can sim games, but you have no control at all over the depth chart, offense/defense used, etc. Like I said, I want to be the GM, but don't want to do quite s much coaching.There's not really any scouting. This would be an obvious and great addition. In signing International players it would be great to find diamonds in the rough/find overrated guys on the decline. Instead you just see their ratings, which is slightly boring, and also unrealistic.It's a good game. It's interesting trying to build teams in different countries and leagues around the world. But, it could be a great game, and, right now, it doesn't fit that bill."

There's no tutorial.There's literally nothing in the game that explains what anything is, how you can use it, why you'd like to, etc. It took me a ton of clicking around just to get back to where I could look at my roster. Also a lot of windows seem to have errors where they come up completely blank. The loading time is also extremely long for what it seems to be loading. There's other odd stuff too like it encouraging you to post fairly mundane things to facebook.When you do actually get to matches there's a simulated scoreboard and some text flavor about what's going on, which is nice - you can pick who to put in for what position. It's more fun there, but could still really benefit from a tutorial. It would be nice to at least see tips pop up when you hovered over something explaining what it meant. The user interface just isn't intuitive and, to me, it feels like a lot of build up and number crunching is required for very little in the way of actual fun.It looks like there's a lot of information, and for people interested in detailed management that's probably pretty cool, but it doesn't even feel like a game as much as a tool to jot down the game - if you already know what you're doing and you've played this kind of game a lot maybe that's great, but until it has a tutorial of some sort and explanation of what you're trying to do I just can't recommend it (especially at 10 bucks.)For certain people I can see it being really engrossing, but you'll have to do your own research to figure out how to play it. I've got other games to dig into and it hasn't shown me anything to make me feel it would be worth the time to figure everything out. So if you feel like checking it out on sale (I got it for 2.50) go ahead, just know what you're getting into."

It does a decent job of giving you options in developing both your franchise and your players and an AI that's always competent without making you feel like the deck is stacked against you. I live in Korea and was very impressed to see a good data base for the Korean professional basketball league and assume the same attention to detail extends to other non-NBA national leagues. Don't be put off by the fictional team and player names. You can go to{LINK REMOVED}http://www.wbmfan.webs.com/and download easily installable real name and real player image files for the NBA. The mechanics for playing individual games is modest but enjoyable and while the interface is a bit clunky and the graphics and sound are retro, none of the limitations are deal killers. While the game can't go toe-to-toe with top priced sports management sims, it's excellent value for money."

No direction, no clue what it is supposed to be doing. I have played other Tycoon games before but this is just terrible. Do not buy this ( I was a dummy and ignored the other reviewers, don't be like me).The game starts by asking you to create a game (which in itself is confusing), then it asks you to create a team or take control of an existing team -( instructions are not very clear). Once that is done, you are stuck - no direction as to what to do next, play a game, trade for players, build a facility? I tried several times and finally just gave up and uninstalled the game"

The tutorial video didn't help me at all. You can lose a game by 40 or 50 points and have no idea what you did wrong. There is no simple way to learn the mechanics of the game. If you have to do serious searching in order to find out how to play a game then that is a problem. I wanted to like this game a lot because I'm a big NBA fan but it's so difficult to even get started in this game. Its really hard to find out if what you are doing in the game is the correct. You can set up, what you think, is a really get strategy and then get blown out by 50 points.Getting to the players. This is the next biggest flaw that I have some of the players, who are based on actual players but with fake names, do not play like the real life counter parts. I played as the fake Hauston Rackets(Houston Rockets) and fake Harden didn't play like real Harden. Never drove to the goal and didn't shoot threes. Fake Parsons didn't play like real Parsons. Was terrible three point shooter and was terrible scoring inside (dunks and layups). There also seems to be no support of the game except for fan based support so that is somthing to be aware of.Wanted to like the game but it has serious flaws"

Yes, there are bugs, yes, some menus are incorrect or misplaced or the text in them is transparent and you can't read it. And so many missing things, even the most basic ones, like comparing the attributes of one of your players with another player in the world (i haven't figured out how to do that yet!). But, i like the managerial tycoon part of the game (setting ticket prices and expanding the arena) and the CORE of the gameplay, the algorithm of the match, its there, it exists, and its rather good. Still no 2D or 3D representation but only text commentary, but for me its OK, reminds me of the old times playing Football Manager 00/01. Also one good thing is that you can quit the game and save during a match, which is missing from FM for example. Also, the game is rather light with respect to system requirements, the loading and processing times are not so big (even for my low low end laptop). As other reviewers have mentioned, there exist a real names patch and a graphics patch for face picks, so don't be discouraged by the lack of licencing. I would give it a 7/10. Without doubt, a lot of work has to be done by the developers (who are Greek like me) as ti seems like an unfinished product, but the basic framework is set. If you like Basketball AND text sports sims with a flavor of tycoon elements, give it a try and be patient. For all the others, not recommended."

When you have possesion and want to stop the clock - you can't call a TO.  Pointless - why do I want to stop it, when it's already stopped?2)  Inability to slide a player when making a substitution.  If you attempt to bring in say a power forward, and slide your current PF to SF (a pretty common thing) - the fields black out.  It's not possible - you need 2 stops of play to make that move, yet the CPU teams can do it.3)  The biggest deal breaker - inability to make trades.  You can put someone up for ""transfer"" and get cash, and you can use that cash to buy players ... but you can't actually trade at all.  In a sport manager game, that's pretty much a deal breaker."
