But the part that make this game best is well-designed challenging puzzles that you can play with relax atmosphere in game.Though the first look is just another of blah blah game but after you played through few levels, you'll fond with the game mechanics, which is, very special crafted and well-blended for the game. Background music is really great, in relax tone. Sound do help chilling your brain down from squeezing it to solve puzzle.This is a MUST for ones who want to enjoy solving puzzle with a good graphic, music and gameplay !!"

It will drive you nuts at times trying to solve the puzzles and the bosses.There isn't really much Killing its more so trying to work around the enemies and the enviroment but in saying that it doesnt mean there is no killing at all.You can customize your many me's with cute different outfits, and you also get the opportunity to be a Bird, a Jellysaur (yes thats right i said a Jellysaur!) and even a tank!If this was intended for children well i feel sorry for them, I can already picture many controllers being thrown across the room or even a desk flip.Worth every cent!"

I found the game to be quite interesting, you start off as one character and you're on an adventurous jorney. Throughout the gameplay, you find more of the little creatures similiar to your little fella you're playing. The music is just absolutely brilliant. I enjoy listening the mysterious tone as I venture through the game with my little green campanions. I have still yet to beat this game and find out more to the game."

,Not Recommended,260530,19683669,"Posted: 13 December, 2015",all,SpatialAnomaly,"A really like the demo and bought the game a while ago, I left it there as I think it leverages too much on extremely precision platforming and puzzles that can end up being frustating because of the above reason. I like the challenge but nearly every single part of the game is precision platforming (when I say precision I really mean it, nearly at the ""pixel"" level or you just die and repeat).It is a shame as the graphic and characters are brilliant and I would have surely enjoyed it if it was a super mario style game more than a serie of frustating levels."

76561198197472951,Recommended,260530,25141034,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,Cookie Monster,"So Many Me is a game I'd recommend to those who enjoy puzzle games which take some time to complete but are not wanting to play a puzzle game where they end up going on Youtube for all the answers.The graphics are astounding and have a child-like feel to them but that doesn't mean that adults and teenagers alike can't enjoy them too.Using your many replications you go on a quest to save the world and the girl. Going through the game Filo and his many ""Me's"" often make jokes about 'saving the princess', 'getting the thing on the floor because you will need it later' and many other similar jokes. The concept of having many replications of yourself and completing puzzles with them definitely made the game more interesting to play.There are 3 unique forms of travel in So Many Me (apart from on foot) which are by Jellophant (Tank), Jellosaur (Dinosaur), Balloonbird (Bird). The forms of travel allow you to travel on spikes and destroy EVERYTHING, destroy vertical walls and jump higher and fly and destroy horizontal walls respectively.Obviously you have a Story which you can play and complete. Within this story are many costumes and coins which you can get through extra effort to eventually fully complete the game.Like many other reviews, the only important downside is the Bosses. The bosses themselves are not too hard but there are hardly any checkpoints in these battles so you have to memorise the landscape and the movements of the boss.Personally I had trouble with one section of the game.After the Final Boss (The guy you meet at the beginning) there is an escape part of the level. The path of this section isn't too difficult but the meteors sometimes hit you at the ONLY moments where you either dodge and fall off the map or jump off the platforms into spikes. The best part of all this is that there are NO checkpoints.If anybody wants to know, I got all achievements in 10 hours and 36 minutes which involves the main story, extra missions (Chrono Castle) and all collectables.I know it says 11 hours on my profile. That's because I left the game on while writing this review :D"

This games puzzles take time to unravel and all the while gives you cheery music and cute graphics to look at. I'd wholey recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle platformers."

It's mechanics create puzzles that are simple to understand and challenging to solve, and the quick restarts guarantee if you mess up you'll be right back in it immediately.
