I've played a ton of this genre and this one has great humor, great voice acting, it's beautiful, interesting, it's challenging, but not too challenging. Really cool what they did with the ghosts in the inventory. Before buying I saw reviews about it not working, so I was hesitant, but I havent had any problems with the game functioning. I'm loving it!"
,Recommended,260550,13173722,"Posted: 30 November, 2014",all,ros,This point and click adventure is cute. It is a little flawed but enjoyable. I would give it a 6.5/10 and say it is worth its price for about 6 hours of light hearted gameplay.You should play this game if you are a point and click fan who is looking for a light hearted story with lots of object based puzzles and amusing dialogue. The production is excellent. The visuals and voice acting are really high quality. The puzzle design is good at first: it is logically sound and the basic interface means you won't get stuck for long.However the puzzle quality diminishes through the game. You still are not likely to get very stuck but by the last two chapters you'll find yourself resorting to trial and error.You should avoid if you are expecting a difficult puzzle game or any kind of involved plot. It is a children's cartoon made into an adventure game and does well as that. It will keep grown ups amused with the amusing dialogue and mostly well designed puzzles but its really best for kids.

It had such potential.The puzzles are unintuitive, the voice acting is strained and/or amateurish, and the writing needs work. The only pleasing character is the shopkeeper in the Chinese shop, but he's only got a few lines, unfortunately.The plot is okay, but the way the characters bicker stopped being entertaining after about the first hour of play. For some reason there is mutual animosity between nearly every character you come across, as if the game's author can't write any emotion other than irritation. The worst offenders are a part of your party and cannot be avoided.I kept playing it because I wanted to get my money's worth, but at this point I'm actively not enjoying myself, so I'm quitting. I already figured out what the villains are most likely up to, anyway, and that was the only interesting thing in the whole mess."

It's a straightforward linear adventure game with an interesting (if somewhat predictable) story, though it suffers from the ""combine random objects to solve random puzzles"" style of puzzle solving that is common to older adventure games.Detailed review:Haunted is a light-hearted and fun adventure game, good for a casual day of playing. It was originally released in 2012, so the graphics and gameplay are somewhat dated but I think the art style has aged well. However, while the idea of using ghosts with particular talents to help solve puzzles is an interesting one, the puzzles themselves are generally best solved not through critical thinking, but rather gathering up everything in the area, seeing what can be combined, then trying everything until it works. The ""puzzle hints"" were supposed to help with this, but the few times I tried them they were so basic (""you need to use what's around you""; ""you need to use the window as a ladder"" type of things) that I ended up turing them off because I kept accidentally clicking them when trying to move around.Speaking of accidental clicking, the camera angles are fixed and so movement is incredibly frustrating in some areas. I was surpised that movement was forced through the mouse instead of being able to be manually controlled through the keyboard, as static 3D camera games don't really lend themselves to click-based movement. If the devs are going to add any future patches (I believe someone else wanted controller support, which I think would work well with the game), I really do think they should add keyboard movement.I was also disappointed that a game that featured a female protagonist trying to save her sister and a female villain lacked any other female characters in significant supporting roles. ALL of the ghosts, except for one you meet at the very end, were men and only two out of the about seven supporting human cast were women. I was also disappointed, though not surprised, that while the male ghosts got a bunch of different body shapes the one female ghost was a Jessica Rabbit-style exaggerated sexy cartoon character. It felt to me like a huge missed opportunity, to be honest.In any case, overall I think that Haunted is a game worth playing for people who enjoy adventure games. My general rule for games is that $1 (or, in my case, 100 yen) should be around 1 hour of gameplay, so I found the non-sale pricetag to be a bit steep for a game that--from start to finish, including the bonus chapter at the end--is not going to yield more than 7 hours of gameplay. However, I would definitely recommend picking this up when it's on sale."

,Recommended,260550,26455055,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Samick,"Haunted is a funny point&click game with easy puzzles and funny references to the Lucasarts era.It is relatively short, but it has a bonus chapter which is unique among p&c games.In chapter 5 there is a bug which does not allow you to continue the game, so save often in chapter 5!"

Your team has a pirate, a kilt-wearing Scot, the Pope, a wolf and a goldfish. And they all talk behind your back...This game is full of eveything I love about a funny adventure game. Banter between the characters, unexpected humourous scenes, that cutscene that just cracks you up. Better than Monkey Island 3...Original Review:This game is delightful! One of the best point and click adventures I've played in a long time."

Not overly hard puzzles, very logical which I love. Also, loved the calls to other movies and games through out (especially the lord of the rings nod) It took me about 3 hours of game play (and i left it on while I went out for the day) and I still have the additional ""quests"". Thanks creators!"

I enjoyed some parts of it, some puzzels and I had two or three laughs, but thats all. I was bitterly disappointed in the end of the game - twice (there is one ""end"" if you finish the main story and  a second/""real"" end if you finish both bonus quests). I don't want to spoil anything, but the end (or both ends) is/were really emotionless and coldhearted. It felt like the developers of the game had no motivation to think about a proper or exciting end at all and they just stopped there. It's a pitty, because it really had potential and I was really looking forward to playing that game."

Goofy shenanigans ensue.The puzzles are mostly straight forward (except the one where you have to Baptiste a sock puppet ?!?!)It does manage to get you invested in the characters and it does have its funny moments."

Dialogs are good and the companions of the main character are funny and add some special habilities to complete puzzles. Puzzles haven't always an evident solution and, you can be stuck for a while but, it doesn't ruins the gameplay experience.It remembers me the great old Lucasart adventure games."

(You'll understand when you see her)The storyline is nice and refreshing, it is fairly easy to determine where and what you need to do next, if you get stuck, you can always ask your ghost friends for a reminder of what you need to do.Love the game and I recommend it."

76561198003085543,Not Recommended,260550,13491297,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,Varon,While a good game and fun to boot it has failed to learn the lessons of more recent point and click adventures known as basic controller support for movement of the character and interacting with objects. If you plan on watching a good story while sticking through with mildly choppy mouse movement in a 3d puzzlebased game you wont be disappointed as it is good but I'm not certain most gamers would go through the effort.
76561198079774395,Recommended,260550,19565445,"Posted: 8 December, 2015",all,lovelyzero,"Exactly what I needed. I was looking for something to play that had an entertaining story but wasn't extremely involved. The characters are great, the storyline is entertaining, the humar is good for a chuckel here and there. It is enjoyable and still relaxing. There isn't a lot of back and forth playing fetch and the ability to utilize different spirits makes for an interesting twist on the game play.I will say, I got this game durring a sale. It might be a bit short for the full price but there's deffinitely a few hours of game play to be had. I easily spread it out over a few days without getting stuck on any parts."

I definitly feel a cool ghostly atmopshere in it and I would say that I am really amazed of the difference it makes to apply low or higher settings with the lights and shadows being effective or not. My PC cannot run it smoothly with the best setting just like Little Nightmares unfortunately. I'm pretty much convinced I would find it very entertaining if I had a better machine.
