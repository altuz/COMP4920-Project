But be aware that it's a way outdated (made in 2005), and even then it wasn't able to compete with Splinter Cell.Why buy it? Well, it's cheap, and it's a spy-story stealth game. You can pass without killing, by fabricating your own devices like rubber bullets, silencers and ether mines from a junk and using cool x-ray camera to look behind, well, almost everything. Oh, if you remember old James Bond game, Nightfire - sorry, it's not That cool.Just keep in mind that there are great games for this genre, like NOLF or Deus Ex, and there are some mediocre and generic, like this one or that JB Nightfire I've mentioned. Some levels are repeating, some actions are boring, but, all in all, it is still a solid piece of gaming, if you're up to this genre, in first place.Best of luck for you, anyways!"
,Recommended,260650,9994203,"Posted: 1 May, 2014",all,LoveJesusHateTheGovernment,"I have to confess, this game was just a ridiculous amount of fun. It felt like I was interacting in a cheesy spy novel, and it did a good job at it. Well, this is a third person stealth/action shooter. The first six to eight levels are more stealth oriented, but once the Russion Special Forces, (spetsnaz) are sent after you, you can pretty much kiss stealth goodbye. It's all shooting from there. It implements a system where you can collect gadgets lying around like rags, alarm clocks, plastic bottles, cans, chemicles, ect. and McGyver them into cheep tools for temporary use. For example, you can use a plastic bottle and rag at the end of your barrel for a cheep, disposible silencer. You can also make explosives, paralyzing chemicle agents, and other completely implausible but fun innovations. But not to worry. It is a very easy system to pick up with very little learning curve. The story is told through a series of comic book-like cutsceens between missions with corny, voice-acted Russian accents that, (in my opinion) adds a lot of charm to this game. I found myself drawn into it and empathizing with the characters. Also I loved the ending! This game is cheep, the controls are very good, the graphics are great for 2005, there is a quicksave system as opposed to a checkpoint saving system, and I ask you: what other game allows you to have a shootout inside of Lenin's tomb? This game has a lot of atmopshere and I highly recommend it. Honestly, if there is anything even remotely negative I can think to say about it, it is that the character moves kind of slow, and has a lot of wide open ground to cover. The sprint system only works for a few moments before your character gets tired and has to rest, so traveling while sprinting isn't too much faster in the long run than walking. Traveling from one side of a map to another can be a bit tedious. But this is a very minor complaint. This game is a definite winner."
,Not Recommended,260650,11867062,"Posted: 25 August, 2014",all,bfRheostat,"Cold War is a 2005 made, parodic stealth action game. It is some kind of 3rd person view No One Lives Forever with hand-made gadgets which starring a journalist. It was really good first. I even planned to recommend it to you, but then, i got bored because of some problems and changed my mind. There are some summarized pros. and cons. below:Pros+ Story is interesting enough+ Graphics are already outdated but it isn't ugly at all.+ Some unique attractions like gadget crafting and X-Ray cameraNeutralNo widescreen support. Control scheme a little bit weird and dull, but somewhat useful as well. Especially setting your walking speed with mouse wheel is a good idea. Music is OK but repetitive.Cons- Stealth is a little bit dull. You can't do so much actions for best stealth results. Furthermore, at the last half of the game, say goodbye to stealth.- Characters you control can't run. They pretend to do so but they seems like they are taking a stroll on the park. Any NPC runs well though.- Aiming is bad. You can't change shoulders while aiming, so, time by time you can't see the target properly.- You're playing on same locations over and over again.- Planting gadgets like mines is deceptive. You have to stop the desired plant location first, then you have to highlight the gadget on the menu and left click to insta-plant.- Background sound effects are annoying.- A frustrating bug on Meltdown level ( spoiler:When you try to stop meltdown in Chernobyl, you have to press two buttons and start the crane, right? Be careful, you have to use these buttons first or else... you can't use crane again. That means you need to restart the level.)After all, it worth for $1,25 but don't expect too much. Especially after the last half, quality of the game started to decrease in my humble opinion.p.s. written in 26 August 2014edited for new formatting options only (blue texts)"

This game seems to be stealth game but in later levels you can play it like Call of Duty and the stealth system in this game is not good too. The good things about this game are twisted and excited story, many creative tools that you can craft them and I like idea of camera that can use as weapon as well plus the fact that main character is reporter making this idea is very creative."

,Recommended,260650,8641743,"Posted: 9 January, 2014",all,Illegal in Iran,"This game is really good, especially considering how old it is. The AI's fairly solid (although sometimes they are somewhat blind), and a few parts of the story are a little bit out of place, but overall it's a great game. There are quite a few cool strategic items that can be crafted from basic components, and the maps have plenty of hiding places. Enemies are able to lose you but will work together to corner you at times. The campaign lasted about twelve hours for me, but that includes a lot of searching and backtracking for items, because that's the kind of player I am. Someone who just rushes through might only take six hours to finish the game.The mechanics are solid, the graphics are nice for the time it was published, the sound is well-done, the levels are challenging, and the gameplay is fun overall. If you like third-person stealth-'em-ups then this is the game for you. Even if it is a bit over 8 years old, it's still worth the five dollars, or perhaps a tad more."

My only complant is that while crouching you footsteps sometimes get out of sync and i tricks you into thinking that there is a guard nearbye that isent or visce versa (witch is much worse but much rarer)Realism 4/10 Granted this is a strange stat but i had to add it, the items you use to caft your tools would never work for what you are makeing (such as a alarm clock and a can makeing a slingshot or a plastic bottle and bullets makeing rubber bullets)this isent a big deal but for those of you who like to have your games as real as possible you should know.Replayabilaty 9.3/10 While the story doest change there are 4 gamemodes and 3 diffuculty levels aswell as the fun of replaying a level just to see if you can do it another way.My summary this game is awsome and for a $5 it is a must have for fans of the genre.If you have any questions please let me know in the comments.P.S. forgot to metion Sterotpying is a big 11/10 evry guard want ciggeretts and vodka I mean evry single one of them!"

So if you haven't played it, I recommend checking it out, even if it is made around 2005, which in my oppinion is when gaming started to really get good so don't overlook it. It's not that dated, really.A definite must have for any power gamer."
,Recommended,260650,11617311,"Posted: 9 August, 2014",all,Sanic the Edgehog,"I haven't fully tested the steam version, but I have played the retail one. A thousand times.Long story short, you play as a guy named Matt Carter who is an undercover reporter and journalist who goes into Moscow to photograph a meeting with the Russian president. Then things go wrong.The game is a third person shooter which seems to, at times, feel much like the classic Deus Ex, where you can run into a room guns blazing, sneak in the shadows and knock people out, or just get from one door to the next. The conspiracy in here buffs up the plot quite a bit.If you can find this on sale, do it. You may get a couple days of gameplay out of it, depending on your styles. I'm glad I found this on sale. I'm just now picking it up after a couple years of not playing it. The game is from 2005, so if you don't care about graphics and prefer story and gameplay, this is a good pick.X-ray cameras were never this much fun."
76561198116707297,Recommended,260650,11843624,"Posted: 24 August, 2014",all,pook99,"This game went on sale shortly after I finished Splinter Cell: Blacklist, it was on sale for $1.24 and when I saw the video I figured it would just be a low budget version of splinter cell and bought it because it was cheap and mostly for the lulz.When I actually started playing the game I was pleasently surprised, as it turned out to be a lot more fun than I expected it to be.  My initial impression was mostly correct, this is essentially a low-budget version of splinter cell, but it is done well and if you enjoy stealth games you will probably like this.The stealth is handled well, you have a visibility meter which shows how visible you are, and you have 4 movement speeds.  The slowest movement speed moves very slow(obv) but the enemies cannot hear you even if you are right behind them and as you increase in speed the enemies will be able to hear you from farther and farther away.  Movement is easily toggled and as you learn the correct distances to which an enemy can hear you, quickly toggling your speed becomes second nature.You also are kind of a MacGyver, you find junk lying around(cans, plastic bottles, etc etc) and you can use this junk to craft al manner of items which make being stealthy easier and easier.  You unlock blueprints as they game goes on and once you unlock a print you can craft that item if you have the proper junk for it, is is all easily done and very intuititve.  The gadgets overall are very cool, you can make a slingshot and craft all manner of silent ammo for it, you can lay traps for enemies(both quiet and non-lethal to loud and boomy) and you can even create luring devices that will make your enemies plod right into your mine, provided you lay the trap in a dark place.  If you drop a mine in the light the enemies will see it and disarm it.You also get an x-ray camera weapon which is beyond cool, it lets you see through walls and locate enemies before they can see you, and it even damages enemies through walls, although ammo is limited for it, it is very cool to be able to just blast enemies silently through a wall.There are only 2 guns in the game, the pistol and an ak-47.  The vast majority of the game is stealth but there are a few run n gun sections, and luckily the gunplay handles well enough, although it is easy to bait the enemies into choke points and just blast them as they walk through.The story is good, and rather lengthy, the game took me about 11-12 hours to complete and there are several twists and turns as the story progresses, it is entertaining and mostly well done.  There is also a save anywhere function which comes in handy, just be warned the game only auto saves at the start of levels so make sure you use the save system because the missions are generally pretty lengthy.At a sale price of $1.24 this game was a steal, but even at the full price of 5 dollars you are getting your moneys worth.  If you enjoy stealth games like splinter cell you should pick this up, it is not as good or polished as that game, but it is a good time and well worth the low asking price."

Wanted to play this for the stealth, but after the new experience factor wore off, the stealth became a slog. By the end, I didn't care anymore and just murdered everyone who got in my way (both because stealthing was torture and also because the game forces you).All in all, a mediocre experience."

You do not need to care about your guy, you are a CIA assassin!- For a 2005 game this has some really good animation and asthetics. The models are very human like, and have a lot of personality.- AI is very smart. No aimlessly running into things. They seek cover, or seek you and attack.-Hard core reaslism! No standing there as they riddle you with round after round. If you get shot, YOU  GET SHOT! Stealth is the key.-Guns are very realistic too. None of this ""snipe with my handgun crap lilke in splintercel. Tou need to be really close to use a handgun, just like in real life. Stealth is the key to this game.-Levels are very well made. Trees are animates. Lights and ambient sounds are all there.- Great post processing for 2005! You get a MSAA like AA in this game by default! very nice looking atmosphere.CONS:it is from 2005, Yes you will need to play it in 4:3 aspect ratio, but it has so much character you will not careThis is not some crappy console port, expect to play with your full keyboard. Xbox and other controller ,Controls can be used but Mouse and Keyboard are essential in the few times you need to make snap shots.Conclusion:10/10, For a 2005 game, and a ""GIVEAWAY"" pricetag in the steam summer sale, I say this is a MUST buy!

One false is that the story is just a bit strange. Overall a good game.Good stealth game for stealth fans. If trying to play without knocking out anyone, you really need to think ahead."
