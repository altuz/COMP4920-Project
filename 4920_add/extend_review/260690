Unfortunately, I am quite, quite dumb, and don't know why I even attempt these point-and-click adventures (perhaps the existence of rare ones that I can actually get my stupid head around, like Sam Peters).But unlike, say, Scratches, which is essentially a poorly-designed imitation of this, I can recognise and appreciate that the puzzles in this are by-and-largely quite sensible and clever, I just honestly COULD NOT BE BUGGERED investing the many hours of my life it will take to complete this without constant reference to a walkthrough. In other words, I'm happy to concede that in this instance it's not the GAME...it's ME. Sigh.The adventure games I ""grew up"" with were more of the early Resident Evil / Silent Hill-ish ilk - that is to say, more ""action-adventure""-ish games - and I believe the more sporadic and generally EASIER nature of the puzzle-solving in such games may have stunted my intellectual growth.  Oh well.  Another failure in life that I will have to tuck under my well-weathered belt...I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this, however, to those of you out there who can rise to this kind of challenge. It's atmospheric, ever-so-slightly scary and as I said, very smart.  The sound design in particular is very impressive, with spooky noises aplenty and voice acting well above par for a video game from any era, not least of all the one that this is from.  It's a quality product, no doubt about it. Just depends on your cup of tea, and the head that you're pouring it into.Verdict: 8/10."
76561198099216008,Recommended,260690,11607479,"Posted: 8 August, 2014",all,Laura Blues,"I'm used to playing the usual point-and-click games, but this one is definitely one of the bests. Reasons why I loved it with a passion:1) It can be considered horror, but it's not a survival horror game. That means you can't die. Nonetheless, the combination of graphics, music and sounds make it wonderfully in horror mood. It doesn't have the classic ""jump-scares"" (which, for me, is a good thing), but it has an overall eerie atmosphere that had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. Now, most players who enjoy survival horror can't feel scared if they know that they can't die, but this game is creepy enough to givemesome occasional goosepumps.2) The puzzles aren't too silly or obvious, but the difficulty doesn't rely on the dreadful pixel-hunt for that little object that you don't know that you have to find*. Also, my favorite thing about this game is that there are absolutelyno""inventory based"" puzzles (meaning, combine items from your inventory in the most illogical ways until you find that specific combination that makes no sense to anyone except the developers). Not here. All the puzzles are logical puzzles, things that you solve by finding clues and using your little gray cells. And that's just my cup of tea.3) Even though you can't run (there isn't double click to move faster), I never got to the point of wishing I could. You don't really have to watch your character walking; it's first person view and movement feels natural.4) This quality for the price is unbelievable. I would recommend buying the Dark Fall Collection (1 and 2) together, even thought I haven't played the second one yet; that's how much I loved Dark Fall: The Journal.*Note: I don't particularly consider it a real puzzle using a key to open a door. I'm talking about actual puzzles that you have to solve."
,Recommended,260690,12481825,"Posted: 13 October, 2014",all,Andem,"I liked this game a lot. It's very very similar to Myst (probably most like Myst 2 aka Riven) except spooky and about ghosts. There's no jump scares at all which is rare to find.It's just a point and click about ghosts and you basically roam around learning what happened. It's actually really neat if you like reading notes. You pretty much slowly start to learn everything thats going on and get to know the ghosts that are there slowly. A lot of the notes are optional and only give you information about the place you're at but it usually comes together in a neat way.an easy example that doesn't give away much: you go into the womans bathroom and there's a flickering light. For just a split second in one of the flickering lights you see a shadow of a person. Sooner or later if you're looking around you'll find out that there had been complaints a LONG time ago about peeping toms and what not. It's just cool how they work it all together. Everything is there for a reason and easy to overlook, but neat if you focus.big problem though is like Myst is its an old school point and click and expects you to write everything down or just know to click certain tiny pixels you'd probably miss. If you want to keep your sanity play this game with a guide on hand and just use it when you get stuck.overall its pretty cool. Really nice atmosphere and generally spooky without a single jump scare which I appreciate a lot. Play it if you like those old Myst games. If you're not a fan, it might not be best to start here."

,Recommended,260690,26083342,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Audish,"There are degrees of puzzle games, and honestly I'm a fan of the straight-forward ones that go HERE IS A PUZZLE and then have you put gears on a board or rearrange a chessboard. Older puzzle games were puzzles unto themselves, where half of the challenge was determining how the actual puzzles manifested in the world. Dark Fall is one such game, so if you're going to dive into this one you'd better have a fresh notebook and a sharp pencil at the ready.Dark Fall takes place entirely in an abandoned train station, where years prior a mysterious event disappeared all the employees and passengers. You're on the trail of your brother, but all you're going to find here are empty rooms and ominous whispers. Delving any deeper into the story will require you to pore over the many letters and newspaper clippings that litter the station, some pages long.You'll need to do that to solve the puzzles, too, or sometimes just to FIND the puzzles. People like to talk about games holding their hands but Dark Fall doesn't even have a hand to hold, just a cauterized stump to wave at you. There's no highlighting, no journal, no clues, absolutely nothing to guide you to your next task in any way. Points of interest are hidden just like they would be in the real world, with lockboxes buried in the deep corners of chests and important documents tucked away under piles of clutter.In fact, just navigating to a point of interest can be a challenge. Dark Fall uses static, rendered backgrounds which you can traverse by clicking to reach a new vantage point. The connections between scenes almost approximate tank controls, with forward and back moving you in that direction but left and right turning your view in place. That means a small room can have eight or twelve perspectives just based on two or three positions, and some of those are just staring at barren walls.I know I'm not doing much to sell the game, but honestly I don't think I should. Not everyone wants to keep meticulous notes on the scraps they find in case they have something to do with an obscure puzzle an hour later. I certainly don't, but I recognize that for those who do, Dark Fall delivers exactly what is expected. With conventions dating from the Myst era, the challenges are more similar to puzzling out an ARG than clicking though a modern adventure. And I will give points for atmosphere, because some haunting sound design made even the decades-old renders creep me out a bit. If you're looking for a real challenge in your puzzles this will deliver, just be sure you know what you're getting into.Did you enjoy this review?

,Recommended,260690,11250891,"Posted: 15 July, 2014",all,Evaheist,"A Classic Myst-style supernatural mystery. Very decent story and interesting enough to keep your attention until the game's ending. Although be warned that the ending is a bit of a let-down and actually quite bland compared to the story leading to it. Anyway, you'll get a decent 7-8 hours of adventuring here if you're good with this type of games.The puzzles are never too obtuse or complicated to solve and you have a chance to freely explore the different environments and find your own clues. Be sure to keep pen and paper around as you will be jotting down a LOT of clues and pictures and notes. This game truly makes you feel like a paranormal investigator who is trying to get to the bottom of a very intruiging mystery. A wealthy amount of notes and diaries flesh out the miriad of different residents of the haunted hotel.The game looks dated and does not run in widescreen but that is not the point here. I still got chills down my spine every time I stepped into the hallways of the derelict hotel. The detail in every nook and cranny is very impressive and does not show any sign of true aging. The use of sound is limited yet strong and to the point. I loved every bit of audio this game had in it.If you are looking for pure horror then this game will be a waste of your time. However, if you want a very atmospheric and spooky adventure classic with good story and challenging yet fair puzzles give this mystery a go. I'm very sure you'll appreciate it if you choose to take it slow and enjoy the full story."

Like a graphic novel that you navigate the pages yourself and piece the story together. There was just one item that was hidden in a silly spot. I would have found it eventually but I work too much and have no time so had to give in to a walkthrough.

Saves work fine but there is no auto save which I think people may have expected.TL:DRRECOMMENDED, Buy it now regardless if on sale or not!!Higlhy recommend for those who have patience, do not mind old graphics and are willing to REALLY think, this does not hold your hand, it is a supernatural mystery with a fair amount of reading, it will leave you scratching your head often.It is eery and really quite indepth as you piece together all kinds of evidence to get to the bottom of the mystery. I have not yet completed it but if you loved the old games that were story driven and dont mind using your brain you will love this game.THE LONGER REVIEWI have always lived in sussex, I recognise a lot of the locations mentioned (the main location is fictional however) so this was like playing a mystery game set in my area which is a personal thing to me that I loved.The graphics are very basic and very old but the story is so involved and gradually gets pieced together with all kinds of snippets of information.The sound and audio is excellent, it isnt used often but used with effectIt is a great ""dectetivy"" game, its not that scary but it is definitely very eery in places and has the odd jump scene too it.It is a game to take your time over, impatient people or people who do not like puzzles within games probably wont like this.If you want your brain to be tested and want to learn the back stories of the characters to get to the bottom of the mystery then I cannot recommend this enough.It is highly beneficial to make notes on paper/text doc etc to save you some backtracking!!I have played the lost crown which i will go back too and wont comment on here but its the same people, the game writers clearly have put passion into this game as it has a rich amount of information, some of which ""seems"" to just flesh out the lore of the game while other bits and pieces prove to be subtle yet crucial to understanding.It can feel a little overwhelming at first but once you immerse yourself in the story it becomes addictive.The game writers clearly have talent in this genre and a passion for it and I look forward to any games they make in the future, I WILL be buying themPROS:Great story: The creators appear to be invested in this game and show a love of building the background ""lore"". The story itself unfolds at a good pace and you really will feel you want to learn what happened.Atmospheric: Eery in places, play in darkness, it is not that scary, more atmospheric which is more immersive than lots of inane ump scares.No hand holding, you really have to think in this game, some of the puzzles are really quite tough at first but with htis comes satisfaction when you solve them.CONS:Graphics: Obviously this game is ""old"", the graphics were probably only average when the game was released and now of course they are dated, they are still good enough and you are never wondering what something is supposed to be, they are functional but I mention this as a con as a lot of people wont like it due to this but this game is not about the graphics!Movement: You cannot use keys, you have to click on the arrows on the screen. Probably the ONLY thing about the game i am not too fond of.I have tried to be objective, I cannot really think about any other cons to this game.If anyone wants to ask questions I will answer them, I do not give spoilers."
,Not Recommended,260690,32391628,Posted: 13 June,all,Zombra,"This game requires alot of patience.  At the beginning, there were plenty of audio cutscenes where I listened to a ghost (?) talk, while the camera was frozen with me staring at a wall.  I also really liked* the time I walked into a hallway and all my controls were frozen for 2 minutes; I eventually realized that this was to make sure I saw a spooky cutscene of all the lights in the hall slowly going out one by one.  Far from being scary or atmospheric, this only served to make me annoyed with the game as I wanted to get back to exploring its creepiness without shackles.*In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic.The game isn't actually creepy, though, at least what little I saw of it.  In the first area I found a high-tech surveillance camera (with crappy controls) that allowed me to look at a wall that I had already inspected visually.  (I found nothing of interest both times.  It's a wall.)  I found a bathroom with three toilet stalls - the game wouldn't let me examine the first or second stalls, so when I clicked on the third one I wondered what I'd find.  I found a toilet.  I spent about a minute painstakingly dragging my cursor over the entire screen, looking for the clickable spot that gave me a reason to be there, but there was nothing.This inconsistency and emptiness extends throughout the introductory sequence.  I found a hat on a chair in a hotel room, and was able to click on it.  My reward?  A close-up view of a hat.  Not interactive, not interesting, apparently meaningless.  Yet there are many environmental objects that couldnotbe examined even this closely.  Did the hat matter?  Was I supposed to care?  There was no indication I should, yet ... close-up.So, at first, I spent most of my time pixel hunting to try to figure out what was interactive - and then discovered that even the interactive objects are noninteractive!My first tangible obstacle was a puzzle box.  Getting it open, I found a secret compartment with a note containing a magical rune.  I couldn't pick up the note.  All I could do was look at it and walk away.  Again, I spent a good couple minutes trying to do something with it, moving that beautiful cursor around trying to find a hotspot, but interaction is not allowed in this game.The next puzzle I found was a simple jigsaw, a torn up note for me to reassemble which contained a clue to deciphering a nearby transposition code.  I stepped away for a moment to look at the coded item, then came back to reexamine the note ... and it was torn to pieces again, necessitating that Ire-reassemble it.  Why?On the positive side, I liked the voice acting.  The performances are good.  I did stick with it long enough to get an initial taste of the story as well, and it seems intriguing and well-written.But that interest is gated behind a cumbersome interface, controls that freeze on you by design, and screen after screen of emptiness and boredom.  The best word to describe my brief experience here isplodding.  This looks like a 5 hour story that would take 20 hours to complete.I guess this is for people who enjoy seeing a (hopefully good?  Who knows?) story emerge gradually; so gradually that one barely notices anything is happening at all.  There's satisfaction in that, I suppose.  And maybe I'm being too harsh on a game that's 15 years old.  But speaking for myself, I don't see enough value here for my time spent, and certainly nothing worth spending money on in today's game market.  Refunded."

But the story for me kind of lacked anything interesting.  It was more of a ""Oh cool more x character background!"" Then I was like ""What is going on??"" I also never really felt like the puzzles were rewarding.  Mainly a decoding part were I wasted time decoding the whole message just to be like ""Welp I already know this."" The story, though for me was lacking, did a good job presenting itself at least.  It is a pretty game for a 2002 game.Finally, just because it says ""Horror-adventure"" in it's about I have to say, it's not that scary at all. And this is coming from someone who refuses to have a TV in their room at night and hates being in a dark room. I was waiting for something thinking 'well it said horror', but other then some moans, random chatter, and the annoying phone...nothing really screamed horror even to me.Also, if you don't like writing stuff down and keeping track of things then this game is so not for you. Almost anything you do needs to be remembered (Therefore written down if you aren't the best at remembering words and what not.) I also felt the ending a bit lacking but I won't get into why because I don't wanna spoil anything.Over all, I just didn't find this game enjoyable enough to recommend it.

The puzzles were good and well designed and weren't so obtuse that you need a guide to get through them. The story is very interesting, and each note or letter you find makes you feel as though you're slowly fitting together the pieces of a big puzzle. The characters are interesting, even if you're interactions with them are limited to sorting through their belongings.

76561198025630001,Recommended,260690,25501986,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,Raid,"No spoiler review. Helpful hints for beginners included.Dark Fall: The Journal is the type of adventure game that I really love. It's Myst-like in that it presents the player with an environment to explore, provides minimal instruction, and allows the player to wander and gradually begin to put pieces of the story together. It is an exploratory journey first, and its atmosphere bleeds through the screen because of its setting: an abandoned English train station with attached hotel. Great sound design, detailed environments, and some well performed voice acting create a fantastic sense of dread, without resorting to cheap (and highly overdone) jump scares. You really feel like you're exploring an abandoned location. Within that rotting an beautiful environment lies the focus and goal of the game, which the player is not given at game start, they are left to read journal articles, newspaper clippings, NPC notes, and the building itself in order to understand what is truly going on. With some footwork, a keen eye, and logic, the player should begin to see a pattern emerge, and then they'll be solving puzzles, and uncovering the mystery of Dowerton Train Station in no time.With that said, I will also comment on the difficulty of this game. Dark Fall doesn't really offer its players any support at any time. There are, obviously, many walk-throughs and guides the player can access on the internet nowadays, but the true adventure game fan would do everything in their power to avoid going that route. I consider it the absolute last resort to use anything resembling a guide, and only after several hours of wandering, experimenting, hoping, and piecing illogical strings together, in the hopes of that elusive 'aha!' moment. If you're a fan of these types of games, it's those moments that you play them for. I'm ashamed to say that I used a guide at two points during this game, and I immediately felt guilty aftwards, though I was surprised at the solutions. This is a very challenging game, in some sections. The difficulty isn't necessarily in the puzzles themselves, but in the execution, perhaps limited by the technology of the days when this was programmed, or in some oversight by the designer. Some rooms are difficult to fully explore unless you swing your mouse around on every section of every room, looking for the right batch of pixels to activate a piece of furniture, or locate a necessary inventory item. Also, the inventory items aren't obvious at first, and using them may catch you off guard; when your mouse arrow becomes a wrench this is when you need to use an inventory item. Sometimes it's just best to experiment with clicking on the inventory items anyway, even if you're not sure. Also, sometimes, using the item in the correct spot can be very difficult and sometimes frustrating. I think these are all fair criticisms, and could certainly be improved in some form of rerelease of this game, though I don't think it really needs one.Being a game that was written, built, and designed by a single person, Dark Fall is a top notch, wonderfully atmospheric horror adventure game that is perfectly designed for the slow-burn weird fiction fan.Highly recommended with the following caveats:- Go slowly, and expect anywhere from 10-20 hours of gameplay.- Scour everything, every room, and every location for anything you can find. You will be visiting and revisiting many of the same rooms fairly consistently. I kept a room log for each floor with the items that were in each, and anything of note that may be important later. It was very helpful. But really, move your mouse around and point it in places you wouldn't even expect there to be something to interact with - there probably will be here.- Take notes, lots of them. Write down anything that you think may sound important. There is a lot of story in the game, a lot of characterization of the NPC's, and a lot of environmental details that don't necessarily lead to any specific puzzle solutions, but you may be surprised here or there by something that didn't seem important at the time. This game has journal in the title, and you should be keeping one filled with notes as you play. You'll be proud looking back on it afterwards when you complete this epic quest.- And once more - go slow. Enjoy this experience. It's worth it. With Autumn coming, and the cold, dark, days of the year approaching, I can't think of a better game to sit and work your way through, especially with a friend or two. This is a great and very rewarding experience."

,Recommended,260690,33870330,Posted: 28 July,all,RipWitch,"Don’t judge ghosts by their spirit orb.With the wide plethora of ghost related shows and movies, such as Ghost Whisperer or The Conjuring, and most is successful no matter if a lot of people hated it afterwards. So when it comes to games of course we will have ghosts in them too. For the most part I never see any quick cash grab games with ghosts like I do with zombies. Though with ghosts being very prominent in the horror genre, with them holding fear in our world, of course Dark Fall will fall into horror. And with this I do find it interesting how they handled the ghosts.Dark Fall is really chill, not rushing things so you can take your time. You come to this abandoned train station and hotel so you can help your brother out. Who told you about some strange happenings while he was working on the area. Once you get there, you are confronted with the mystery of why people disappeared and soon figure out a way to release their spirits. You are literally put in to go through the story freely as you do not need to go through it in the order it wants but just to get to the end and achieve it.This is heavy on the reading. Without being able to talk to anyone, all the history and clues resides in books, notes, and various papers scattered around. It does a wonderful job in this regard as you get the feel for all of the people who disappeared and the hotel you end up spending most of your time in. Many of the clues will also be revealed in your readings but you do get a sense of whether it will be important enough to jot down, or if you already got to the puzzle you will know what information you need to get.And while yes some of the puzzles and items are far out there. I even had some troubles with finding solutions; some just being that I did not know I could view the contents or just missing a movement prompt and another to trigger a ghost to talk. But most of them are fairly easy to get through and figure out, especially the overarching one. I do like how they are all connected to the residents of the rooms at the time, especially since they hid all the scraps of paper with the symbols you end up looking for.The greatest strength is definitely the atmosphere. Everything adds onto the atmosphere making this eerie. There is barely any music during the actual gameplay. Making a simple ringing of a phone send goosebumps as it slices through the silence. The only place that predominantly has some sound is the room hallways and I actually thought it was more towards the ghosts making it before I found a device that measured what activity is more likely to take place based on the distance you were to the ghosts. With this I love that the ghosts talked to you. With my previous experiences being the ghosts attacking you or being hostile, I like that these ghosts had no interest other than just talking. And well it sure spooked me the first couple times. One of my favorite moments was going into the room of Matilda, the actress. When you poke through some papers she reveals herself with an observation that you like poking through people’s stuff.I, personally, do not find the graphics too detrimental to the experience. Everything is supposed to look old and it does well showcasing this. Though if you are someone that finds updated graphics vital to the experience you might not like how this looks.It does have a weird window resolution, which will of course mess it up for your computer if you alt tab, but I never had any problems of the screen being unviewable due to this. Without changing my resolution, the hit box of items were still accurate and the movement arrows still showed but of course you will need to get used to where they generally show up at. Such as door ones being on the handle rather than being the door itself. Though of course I do have an average screen size/ resolution so those that have bigger or smaller sizes might run into this problem.Overall+ Atmosphere+ Story/lore+ Ghost interactions+/- Graphics- Weird fixed resolutionDark Fall 1 The Journal is one of these games that you will spend time reading about and exploring your surroundings. If you do not like games that give you little to no guidance, not linear, and has old graphics, this might not be for you. I did thoroughly enjoy going through the rooms and finding out the mystery with a few nice ghost interactions."

The Darkfall games are indeed creepy at times but the scariness subsides when you don't know where to go or what to do next.  Frustration sets in and you're forced to use a guide to finish, which ruins this game for me.  You are constantly walking around the station looking for things to click on next even after you've already been in a certain area.  Backtracking is a huge deal in the DF games and personally I can't stand that.  The old pre rendered graphics don't bother me...its the lack of an explanation of what to do next that irks me.With that being said, I don't think it's a terrible adventure title, I just couldn't get into it. Animations and sound bits will constantly recycle if you keep clicking on things, even much later in the game. For example, clicking on a portrait in one of the rooms will play a sound bit from a ghost. Clicking back and again on the portrait will just recycle the sound bit over and over. You'd think that ghost would get tired of saying that same line over and over. Just stuff like that ruins the immersion for me.  Get this and DF 2: Lights out only if they're on sale."

I was pleasantly surprised by the rich story and immersive atmosphere. The game certainly has a Myst vibe to it; the player feels completely isolated and must put together the answers to puzzles without much in-game guidance. There is a small hint feature in-game but it's rather unpredictable and not particularly useful toward the end of the game. If you like this old-school type of adventure game, then I would certianly recommend playing Dark Fall. If you are not into puzzles or prefer games that offer a little more hand-holding this game is probably not for you."

I finished it but it was more like a chore than a fun thing to do. This game is not just old, it's rather ""primitive"", belongs to the times of exploring possibilities to come up with very original designs while looking for a niche on the raising PC gaming industry.Nowadays, this game is just dated. It is really dated. There are several nice things like the voices, the clever puzzles, the sound effects and the somewhat effective mystery atmosphere.But it is just not too much of a game now, it is not entertaining. One word: notes. Yup, you need to take notes, plenty of notes, cause there's not a single information that you can store and check up later in the game. So pen and paper. For today's standars, that's like using an abacus instead of a calculator. Then, there are no titles and there are a lot of dialogues that are, at times, hard to get due to sound effects and stuff. Even when there's a boy in the game that can provide you with some clues, you can easily get lost. There's a lot to explore and look for, but is really hard to get what is important to solve a riddle and what is just atmospheric. Story wise is fine, but nothing too original or even interesting and is hard to follow because of the many, many notes scattered around.I'm on windows 7 and it runs fine. No bugs or crashes.So, as said, it is challenging, but not cause it is hard to solve, but because it is a chore to solve. Interesting, yeah, but fun to play... nah. And since I play for entertainment, I can't recommend it."

I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys point and click adventures and doesn't mind some thinking. However, the game is TERRIBLE at explaining things. My advice would be if you want to play this to have a pen and paper to hand and write down EVERYTHING that you can. Often there will be some tidbit in some random book about some random character and that will actually be crucial information. Whilst this is not necessarily a problem, it isn't even mentioned from the outset you need to either have a notebook and pen to hand or be rainman. It's extremely frustrating to have to go back and re-read through everything (and worse, repeating completed puzzles - unforgivable!!!) just because there is some random word(s) you will need to remember.Aside from those few nags GET THIS! It creates an awesome atmosphere and if you get into the storyline and follow it to the end it can be really satisfying. A respectable 7/10"

In this one it's possible to walk around a bit and click this and that, read something and get the story and perhaps solve one or another little puzzle...but the most important things 99% wouldn't even recognize - by far too abstract. Some steps what to do after this or that are nearly impossible to find on your own. Futhermore there are things you don't recognize that you can even click on them, even if you tried. Found some while using solution and searching the exactly point to click on - unthinkable to beat this game without. It might be worth buying in sale if you get the solution and follow it - just to experience an interesting story with good atmosphere. Although i want to support this developer for the style of his games, I can only recommend this one for collectors of his games. Others will nearly for sure get frustrated soon...The ending scene was as exciting as the last swallow in a cup of coffee. All in all i can say that the game shows the potential of the developer.

Reasons for no giving it a 10/10 is because the game gets boring after a while, which is why i have such few hours played into it. I also think that the whole point to click game style is boring, only because i am not a big fan of such games. NOW! A reason for why i do like the game: Even though i said that i dont like the whole point and click to play style, this is one of the few games that i can put up with because of what kind of game it is (Horror/Adventure) which with the combination of the two makes it seem right to make it a point and click. But that is not the only reason why i like it, the game is actually pretty scary if you play it with all the lights off, by yourself and you are half asleep, which in my opinion is the best time to actually experience and horror game. Other reasons I like this game is because of the storyline is pretty cool and so is the special effects, i.e, random sounds, conversations. For example in the beging i was on the second floor of the motel in one of the rooms and all I hear is a voice telling me to get out of the room or else, way too creepy. But without further or do, I believe the game is totally worth $4.99 and i recommend that anyone reading this to get it right now :D"
