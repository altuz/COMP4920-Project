However with latest hardware, and operating systems, it has rendered this epic game completely unplayable (laggy mouse, low resolution, and crash to desktop every 5 minutes). This should have been re-worked, and re-patched, before being allowed on to Steam.As mentioned on even the positive reviews, Desperados does not work on Windows 7/8/10. At least, not very well. I have reported this to the developers, but my thread(s) were completely ignored, and we have never received any acknowledgement that these compatibility issues even exist, even though they clearly DO. My current issue is a complete freeze up of the game after 5 minutes, followed either by a crash to desktop, or a BSOD.It's a BRILLIANT game, but you will likely be put off of it by the performance issues before you have a chance to appreciate it's brilliance. Save your money, and just pray that the developers fix the issues with W7 and W8.Update 1st Dec 2013: There is a ""directdraw"" fix available in the forums which fixes mouse lag, however the crashing is still ongoing. It seems that patching has stopped for this game already.Update 25th Feb 2014: There appears to be an unofficial work around for the crashing issues available in a stickied forum thread. This is not developer supplied, and edging on the side of caution, I would prefer NOT to download random "".dll"" files off of the internet - especially those hosted on rapidshare. I am unlikely to ever try the fix for myself, and the ""Negative"" review stands, as long as the developers fail to patch these aweful compatibility problems."

This is THE game.I've completed this game at least 10 times when I was younger, and I'm happy to know it's on Steam now. This is on my personal top 3 of the best games I ever played. Good story, good gameplay with a mix of action and stealth, good atmosphere, good locations and the characters have a nice voice acting (In Italian).Anyway, if you have Windows 7/8, I suggest to DON'T BUY this game, because it doesn't run pretty well. Most players say the game is unplayable for who have the newest OS, because there's a drop of FPS + laggy mouse and multiple crashes during the game, but there are some ways for fixing part of those problems if you read the threads in the community hub. So, think twice before buying it!I use Windows XP and the game works fine except for some crashes (2 in 16 hours of gameplay, for me).You should play it.10/10"

The artstyle still looks just fine even though it is an old game. The 6 characters you will play as have variad skills, which you can use in creative way. There are no easy or scripted way through enemis and you will have to make your own way using tools given to you. The game is hard and you will have to use quicksave a lot on your first playthrough. Still, it is a great game in a long forgotten genre of games. It was fun back in 2001 and hold up really well to this day."

BUT it's unplayable on anything newer than Windows 8, which is incredibly sad. Sure, there is some thingy that will make it run with more than 7 fps, but the developer should do something about it.That being sad, if you have an old PC or Laptop, with that I mean something with an OS that's Win7 or older - install Steam there and play this jewel of a game. This game got it all: some of the most athmospheric western music, absolutely badass characters, great and creative level design, superb voice-acting (I'm playing the German version, so I can't say anything about the English one) and some of the smartest AI I've ever seen: enemies will group up and investigate together, they will get suspicious if one of their friends is suddenly gone and will investigate, and they will even do things like kicking dynamite-sticks you throw at them right back in your face if your not careful.My rating of this game would be:Sound: 9/10 High quality, some gunsounds (Sam's Winchester for example) sound a bit weirdMusic: 10/10 Absolutely amazingGraphics: 10/10 It's an old game, yes, but it looks colourful, alive and detailedStory: 8/10 A western through and through, but with a surprising twist in the end.Characters: 10/10 You WILL love band of misfits you're playing asChallenge and Leveldesign: 10/10 Some missions are easy, and some are REALLY DANG HARD. There is one mission where you're not allowed to get spotted in a certain area of the map, which is a little sucky, but it makes sense story wise and can easily sneak around that area, so it's simply a little extra challenge.Overall: 10/10It's simply amazing, especially for how old it is. For me personally, it is one my very first games ever, and it's still fun and feels fresh today. It's right up there in my top 5 games, together with games like Metal Gear Solid 3 and Civilization IV."

It plays exactly like the Commandos series except this time we find ourselves in the Wild West! You can control 6 characters throughout the 25 missions the game offers. Some are pretty hard (again, a similarity with Commandos) and quite long. The characters of course are not present in all missions - the game gives you a different variety all the time.This was one of my favourite games more than 10 years ago! The game still looks decent as the levels are quite detailed and I'm sure there are a lot of people who can appreciate 2D graphics these days.

Many of you will have seen lots of comments and discussions about how this Steam version doesn't work well on newer versions of windows, including Windows 7 64bit. I read everything looking for the fixes, but it in the end Desperados worked perfectly without any patches or modifications. I'm guessing the developers cleaned up this release over the last 3-4 months so credit to them.If you haven't played Desperados before, it is essentially Commandos 2 but set in the wild west with hilarious cliches to the max! Very fun, lots of character, beautiful artwork (although it has obviously aged quite a bit), excellent story, and lots of tactical variety. There are many ways of getting through each level, and the difficulty scales up nicely.Bargain at a fiver."

You could need even more of it, if you encounter the same issues as I did - during my gameplay (on W7x64), the game was FREEZING A LOT and the only way was to kill the process from the task manager.This game can be fun over time, but can get dull if you play it too much."

For example the lady that can both attract and knock out an enemy once they are close enough. But it does require careful work. It does suffer from one of the problems that a lot of stealth games have. That weapons are over-powered.

Strategy goes a long way as shooting your way out usually does not end well.Like several people mentioned though, this game do not work to well with Windows 8, although I cannot confirm this as I have Windows 7 64x. With my play though, the issue I ran into the most was crashing, anywhere from 1 - 4 times a mission, but it wasn't enough to ruin the game as it loads fast and easy to continue from where you crashed (If you quicksave a lot)."

Its as if it is constantly lagging.I know my laptos not the problem, I can only assume the download is due to the fact commandos behind enemy lines download doesnt come with a save/load system."

The tutorial was not informative what so ever, half of the time playing the game was spent trying to figure out what all the icons meant. The game play itself is rough for a turn based and the main character is a cheesey hard♥♥♥♥♥which isn't too big of a deal however when the game isn't enjoyable it's just another add on to the dissapointment. It is a pretty game but unless you want it for a desktop I do not recommend buying this game."

At the beginning, the game froze every 5 minuts, so I had to kill it and start again. Then, after few levels, the situation was better. Frequency of freezing was lower and lower. Finaly, I was able to play few last levels without any problems.I tolerated all of those restarting because:- starting this game on curent computers with SSD disk is really fast- you can (and you should) use quick-save all the time- this old good stealth western game is just AWESOMEI enjoyed the game 15 years ago, and I enjoyed it again."

76561198052436469,Recommended,260730,33596309,Posted: 16 July,all,Hekateras,"I played the game a lot as a kid (in German at the time, though it was an EXCELLENT localisation) and it's been a pleasure to rediscover it now and discover that it's just as good as I remember.Very brief description: you control up to six different characters at a time (depending on plot progression and mission), each with unique abilities, and have to make use of them to complete the map with various objectives, usually eliminating or otherwise taking out most enemies in the process.The plot is fairly interesting, but not the focus. Gameplay is the main pleasure. The controls are extremely intuitive and the design is full of little details that you sometimes have to discover by yourself regarding how best to eliminate the enemies. Often using elaborate lure and distraction tactics. There is usually an easier and more elegant way (involving a specific ability) to get past big obstacles in the game (for example, a gang of bandits showing up to besiege the tower you're trying to kidnap their leader from), but raw persistence and shoot-outs will also eventually solve the problem. AI is pretty good and includes a lot of potential complications for you - mooks tend to band together, send underlings to explore suspicious noises, call for help, etc. Sometimes, but not always, they'll be adept at spotting things out of the ordinary (such as a missing patrol partner or a horse wandering around by itself) and might even raise the alarm just because of that. Enemies tend to be just as good at shooting as the protagonists. Quicksaving and reloading often demonstrates that enemies sometimes take slightly different approaches even to identical situations, so there's a good degree of unpredicability. Quite often, difficult situations arise spontaneously, such as an enemy spotting you when you hadn't realised he was there, or your desperados being held at gunpoint when they were safe just a moment ago. It makes for fairly unpredictable, adrenaline-filled strategising, and these situations can be extremely thrilling. By occasonionally switching up the combination of characters available to you, the game also does a good job forcing you to adapt your tactics and come up with new things. Combat is fairly realistic - shooting lethality and accuracy decreases dramatically with distance, but guns are almost invariably instantly lethal at short range. Most of the characters have a firearm as the primary weapon, but each has a slightly different one - for example a revolver, a rifle, a small handgun, a shotgun, and a long-barrelled Colt that can be converted into a sort of sniper rifle. They all have different attributes in terms of reach, loudness of the shot, reload speed and magazine size, so are best suited for different situations. Care must be taken when shooting if the weapons begin to overheat. The same level of detail and variety applies to the environment, with some elements having different effects on how far sound carries, for example. In short, some very nice gameplay design, thoughtful and detailed without being overcomplicated or ceasing to be intuitive.Cons: I can't trully come up with negative points for this game except that maybe the story and characters might be a bit too simplistic for some tastes. (Personally, I think it works the same way often simple characterisation for adventure movies works.) In this and other ways, the game is a little bit dated, having come out in 2001. Though I think the graphics, even the 3D movies, actually withstood the test of time very well, it's obviously not on the level of modern games. In terms of characterisation, the overuse of Mexican stereotypes (and Chinese ones, to an extent) would rightfully be seen as too crude today. Though on the flip side, not every game made in 2001 had a multiracial cast that was also one third female, so that deserves some points. On the gameplay side, there were some moments when I felt that the quickest, simplest way through a level relied too much on weaknesses of AI (for example, running towards gunshot sounds into a pile of corpses where you'd hidden a snake in the shadows without a second thought). (Sam's rattlesnake was borderline gamebreaking at points for the body count it had, but it was balanced by how quickly enemies would kill it if they spotted it in advance, and by how few spots were actually suitable for it.)I recommend this game if you like Commandos-style gameplay coated in a layer of pleasantly familiar Wild West cliches. ;)"
,Recommended,260730,29139462,Posted: 9 January,all,Amdir,"Desperados is a fantastic tactical game that manages to build up the atmosphere of the Wild West as well as games like Red Dead Redemption. Back in the old days I first came across this game through the Demo Disc that came with Kellogg's cornflakes. The demo was fun, which made me buy the game afterwards and I can't recall how many hours I spent playing this game.It was one of my favourites when it was released, and still today I really love it. You can play the game in many different ways and solve the missions either by shooting your way out, or using stealth. The story and the characters are great, but most of all the map design is amazing.Sadly the game does not work too well on modern computers, but using DxWnd it has worked really well on my computer. If you want to play this game, be prepared to do some fiddling to get it to work. Even though it can be a bit messy, when you get it to work this is a great game for all Wild West lovers.A thread named ""Workaround Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10"" can be found in the game's forum, which will guide you through the process of making the game work.Score for the game: 9/10Score for the poor port: 2/10"
