,Recommended,260750,7812713,"Posted: 28 November, 2013",all,Foxysen,"First, let's talk about Steam release.This compilation includes the original 2 games of the series. You may seen other games which have numbering from 3 to 7, but those were made by other publishers and aren't exactly official, from what I know. (Most of them are quite ugly and didn't bring any evolution/revolution to the formula of the first game)This Steam release is a simple and flat ""put game as is"". This can be blamed on that new publishers have no access to the source port or other materials. Thus you will not find any trading cards, achievements, widescreen or any optimisation at all, not even Steam Overlay work in this one. On good side, the game should still work on modern computers.Now the games themselves:Neighbours From Hell 1 is point'n'click quest in which you control Woody as you make him sneak around the house, avoiding being seen by Mr. Rottweiler, and make traps, which usually involes first collecting an item in the house and then applying them to the object in house. Some traps may lead neighbour to another nasty trap. Oh, and tip-toeing around Neighbour's pets.Beating the game by getting minium requeirement of traps is quite easy. Beating it by finding and applying every trap in every level is simple as well.But what make the game the real crunchy puzzler is getting 100% rating on each level. To do this you are required not only to make use of every trap, but to make sure that Mr. Rottweiler get in as many of them in a row before he cools off from previous trap, resulting in him breaking down on each new one (with animation of him almost breaking his back). The timing, order of tricks and placement of traps which can be put in any room (items like marbles) to connect faraway traps is everything there, making you actually think and plan there.The second game then takes place outside of house on various exotic locations. Sneaking is no more, gone are guardian pets. System of multiple lifes were added, so you aren't immeditly screwed when Neighbour sees you for the first time. And this time your life is made harder by a sudden appearance of mom of out bully, who keeps an eye and fists for you as well. Shame that she mostly spends her time either sleeping or shopping.This time around getting the golden statue, which is equalient to what 100% rating was in the first game, is much easier, as Neighbour rage now stores on a meter that can stack ""breakdowns"" from other tricks and it cools down much slower. So it's a simply matter of making trap ahead of neighbour path non-stop, with no real thinking. Instead the game concentrates more on the figuring out tricks themselves and their activating, with some tricks working as part of ""combo"". Still, no real puzzle.Now, the games are overall quite fun, with great music which fits to the game goodly and the joyful graphics that use prerendered 3D assets, which are greatly animated. It especially shows with a cartoony characters that the second game is full with. My only complaints would be same repeating breakdown animation for Mr. Rottwell in the first game, which was varied nicely in sequel, and how underplayed neighbour's mom is in Vacations, who could be less passive.OH, and one of more important things: If you are fan of the slapstick humor (and slightly black one), then I am sure that you will be holding for your belly in this game from laughter."
,Recommended,260750,18975081,"Posted: 9 November, 2015",all,Faudraline,"Neighbours from Hell Compilationis a collection of short adventure/time management games -Neighbours from HellandNeighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation- developed and produced by JoWooD in 2003-2004. They are the kind of perfectly silly games that you'd try during an initially boring afternoon with a mischievous smirk on the corner of your mouth.Meet Woody, our main character, who has sworn to make every living moment hell for his despicable neighbor, Mr. Rottweiler in a 2D animated fashion. The whole concept of the game is based on a sitcom: cameras do follow Woody as he sneaks around to play juvenile tricks in ACME quality - like setting a banana peel on a slippery surface, drawing funny faces on family portraits or changing the coffee in your neighbor's pot with compost - on his nasty neighbor and dabble with which actually shouldn't concern him. On that manner, Woody is basically a human version of Bugs Bunny in plastic animations.The second instalment of the series is basically same, with some more characters, a different environment and mini games thrown around. This time, Woody follows his neighbor to his vacation spots to show some personal attachment. Is he obsessive, or what? Oh, and Woody has given 3 chances to complete his series of trickeries before his neighbor catches him this time. Graphics are slightly better, yet the main idea is same.In each episode of the show, you are given 5-7 minutes to follow your neighbor's pattern for the episode, discover and initiate a series of crude jokes and traps for him to fall for while avoiding getting caught sneaking around. The more you manage to lay the outcome of your tricks in short periods between, the better rating you get for the given episode - so your poor neighbor wouldn't recover from the joke before and lose his temper to display funnier poises.Neighbours from Hellis a cute, yet not very imaginative game with crass jokes. The concept is interesting, yet it is not particularly funny. Once you complete each episode with 100% rating, - which is real easy if you follow the patterns - there is no replay value at all. Go for it when it's on discount, and either spare a lazy afternoon to try and enjoy it or offer the idea to your kids in case you have any. Do I recommend it? Well, not particularly good but, hey! At least it's kid friendly... if your kid is into ACME humor, that is.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

No real replay value as once you figure how to get that perfect 100% score run, you pretty much beat the game. However, you can have far more fun if you're just playing it for the first time and performing random, non-sequential tricks just to see all animations."

This can range from disabling his washing machine to sawing the legs off his sofa. You get higher scores by forming a chain of incidents together. His blood pressure increases to the point that he almost falls over hehe.There are only three seasons of the show which took me a total of five hours to finish but its dirt cheap and comes in a pack with the next title.A fun comedic game that gives a good many laughs for a modest price.

Not ""good BUT 2d"", but ""good AND 2d"" if you know what I mean. If you don't know you're too young, well, 3d is not equal to visual beauty all the time and 2d is just ""old"" not necessarily ugly or bad. This game proves it. Additionally, it has a very original gameplay if you're sick of RTS RPG FPS.I still recommand this game."

A charming point and click game which, also happens to be one of my favorite game genres.To start off this review lets take  a look at the concept of this game. You play as Woody, a content young fellow who is terrorized by his dispicable neighbor Mr. Rottweiler. You start to skulk around his house as the star of a T.V show. Your job is to set up traps in his house to terrorize Mr. Rottweiler and enact your revenge. One of the things that I love about this game is the creativity of the traps and the strategy that's behind them. A lot of the traps in this game are clever and took me a while to figure out. Timing also plays a huge role, especially if you want a percentage of over 90% (Like me). It really does keep you on your feet as you have to be aware of Mr. Rottweiler. Also, there are no lives in this game. If you're caught, you have to restart the whole level. While these aspects have drawn me towards loving the game, there are some factors I can't stand. Mainly the immature humor. Now, listen. If done correctly, immature humor can trigger a laugh here and there but, in this game it feels a tad bit forced and monotonous. It doesn't ruin the entire gaming experience but, it's there and it does annoy me when I see it.Overall, I do reccomend this game. If you're like me and you're a huge fan of Strategy/Point and Clicks, you'll find enjoyment from this game right away."

Not only because it's always been a great game, but it was also ten times cheaper than the time I searched through every single video game aisle of each store in a gargantuan mall as a kid, just to find this game. It amazes me to see how this game can still be enjoyable after 13 years. The nostalgia I felt as I stepped into Rottweiler's home to give him hell... GOOSEBUMPS!All those feelings aside, even if you've never played this game as a kid, even if you're lacking the element of nostalgia, I'd say this game still is pretty fun. If you would enjoy a good ol' slapstick/physical comedy filled game, that is. Then I'd definitely recommend you to buy this game."

And do you have a particular type of a neighbour, that annoying and upleasant type, who rants because your parking is too noisy and your TV is too loud, but he hosts parties and kicks you in the face when you tell him to tone the music down? And have you ever dreamed about revenge? Ever thought about  breaking into his house and making his life as miserable as possible? Well now you can, at least in this classic title(s) by JoWood. Take the role of Woody, a young happy guy, who enlisted for a reality show about taking revenge on his annoying neighbour. Many people are confused about the genre of the game, I'd describe it as a stealth puzzle adventure. Check situation, do pranks, don't let him catch you. Sounds simple, but some levels are really challenging, and getting 100% score on each level is much harder than the casual and childlike look of the game would suggest. Both titles (NfH1 and NfH2) are tons of fun, challenging and enjoyable, and I recommend them to anybody who likes adventure/stealth games or just enjoys taking revenge on annoying neighbours."

The game was Prank TV... sadly, I don't believe that this game still exists.The game is a classic casual game about pranks, and not getting caught pranking a really rotten apple of neighbor... Meet Mr. Rottweil (well, I just hope that no poor dog of the same race will be harmed by this game) a bad mooded, rotten and foulmouthed stinker in your neighborhood... He did several very, very bad things - like biting a neighbors dog, and now Wally is in for Revenge...You have to study his movement patterns to prank him with the highest rate of efficiency... and see him go balistic, well in pranking I am more the kind of George Hayduke type of pranker - if it doesn't hurt it's not a prank at all... So I am going very sympathetic with... Wally... of course.The game should be played as a casual game, and like good wine it should be savoured... don't play all episodes in one  run, it will destroy the experience and you will be missing a lot of those two games - especially the fun. Try to manage 100 % even though it's not required... but then again, it's fun...The game has some good 2D artworks, for a low budget game (even as it was created, it was low budget... I still have my original CDs in my archive...) some of the artworks might remind players to a famous comic artist out of north germany, responsible for commercial design of a gas company and... of course his own trademark... which already was theme of five regional very sucessful movies.

The same goes for the second game with the exact same game time. The art style is cartoonish/clay and fits with the theme of the game - TV show about pranks. I have to give it that it is original in it's concept, but that is about it for being special. The jokes are really focused for chlidren so as such I might not be the best reviewer. I found them okay at best but mostly they were simply not funny. The second game in particular is a bit tedious with the mini-games. After doing a level perfectly (which is easy in most levels) there is no point of playing it ever again. Overall both games are okay but mostly for people that like (corny) pranks a lot. I recommend getting it during a sale.------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review you can find more on theCurator pageor in myReview Corner."

,Recommended,260750,15519175,"Posted: 24 April, 2015",all,ElectricHellKnight,"I played Neighbours From Hell way back when it first came out on CD-ROM, over ten years ago. I later bought the sequel (also on disc) after it came out. It seems to me like if these games had been first released within the past few years, they would have been more widely known. These sort of games seem like prime ""meme material"" and the kind of thing that would thrive on the modern internet.Neighbours From Hell might as well be called ""Trolling: The Game"". The entire premise of the game(s) revolves around playing pranks on your fat alcoholic neighbour as part of the reality show in which you star. The whole objective of the game is essentially to make his already-miserable life even worse. The angrier you make him, the more points you get. The pranks start out relatively mild (drawing on family photos, egg in the microwave, clogging the toilet, etc.) but as you progress through the game they become more complex and unique (shorting an outlet and electrocuting him, for example). The game can get boring at times, but usually there is a new and unique prank right around the corner to keep you entertained.The first game confines you to the neighbour's house, starting with just the first and second floors. As you progress through the game, you will unlock more floors and rooms to access. The second game, however, is far more expansive and takes you to multiple places as you follow the neighbour on his vacation.Overall, these games are great for some stupid fun. Replay value is unfortunately pretty minimal, as once you've discovered everything you can do, there is limited enjoyment in re-watching the effects of the same pranks over and over again. But the first time through each game is well entertaining, and figuring out the various pranks definitely incorporates a fair amount of puzzle-solving elements (especially in the second game). While these elements are not overly-expansive, they do force you to think a bit. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a few hours of cheap and stupid fun."

Not only are the missions all basically the same, but every time the neighbor catches you, you have to redo everything you've already done in that mission.  To beat a mission, you basically need to turn it into a ""speed run"" where you do everything in a certain sequence and timing.-Overly linear.  There's no creativity in the pranks.  You have to use specific objects on specific objects like a point and click game.  All the pranks are totally ""pre-cooked.""-Poor controls.
