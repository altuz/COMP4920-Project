,Recommended,261030,8083467,"Posted: 17 December, 2013",all,Kenuty,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW~If you are a fans of the original  game, this is season 2 of an ongoing popular series based on a comic and tv show. the main character this time is Clementine, the little girl who must survive in this post apocalyptic world filled the undead and lost hopes will discover that the people she meets and the choices she makes can be much more dangerous.The game starts off showing off  your previous gameplay choices from season 1. Also it carries over your save from 400 days which doesn't do much but be ready to load them anyways! The game  starts off suspenseful, sometimes slows down to give the player a grasp on whats going on and picks right back up on the action. At the same time,  the story adapts to the choices the player makes while still following a main plotline itself. If you enjoyed the original series then you will enjoy this one much more, The new way the ui interface guides you is much more nicely done in terms of  being smoother  and cannot be any  easier to understand. As you watch the episodes play on you'll see that the game slowly advances itself with much more interactivity and choices.The gameplay is quite simple to play and  has much more than just qtes (quick time events). Aside from pressing and smashing  certain key buttons during sequence there will be time when players willl have to control Cleminetine to interact with the game's environment itself along with various actions such as sneaking, shooting,  or interacting with other characters in the game in regards to the situation. As the episode is played the player will have to make choices in dialogues that will be shown on the screen, There will be a limited time to do so before it is default randomly picked to keep the story flowing.Aside from the amazing voice acting, well written dialogue, beautifully drawn cell shaded art and immersive story line. The game includes choices to make the player feel every emotion humanly possible . Depending on the choices that'll be made, Cleminetine will either seem like a cold hearted human being or one that will tolerate and love for everyone. The decision is yours to make. Although there are times in this game  there will be limited choices to make due to the main plotline, it will shake the very foundation of her conscience and yours.[WARNING]- If you suck at QTE etc this game will take you a long time to conquerYou will see death scenes, many many death scenes which can be quite gruesome so try to stay alive.[WARNING]If you have a faint heart, be ready because some of the scenes in this game is not for the squeemish. There will be many things you do not want to see in this game but it brings out the immersion to it and emotions.Enjoy the game Cool hats off to you and Game ON!+ Cell shaded beautiful artwork+ Immersive storyline+ Leaves you on the edge with suspense+ Experience fear, joy, dispair, anger, love, and the feels+ The art is fantastic and well drawn.+ The voice acting is superb and top quality+ Adaptable story choices that will keep you playing and wanting more.+ - its a graphic novel game with Qte, you will either like it or don't like it- Its a graphic novel game, not everyones type of game but it is one of the best ones out there.- You'll have to replay the game to see different choices, though it doesn't really change out the main storyline direction itself but it will affect many events- If you haven't played part one of the walking dead or seen the show, you will not understand certain events that is going, just jumping into it is ok but you will miss out on the backstory.- Waiting for the episodes, if you are impatient lol.written and Played ontwitch/kenuty - Finished on 8/26/2014Yt- Will try to do a video review without spoiler sometimesAll comments and feedback are appreciated, stop by and say hi when I am live, keep the bottom spoiler free and subscribe to the tube if you want and check out my other reviews on steam."

76561198144771238,Recommended,261030,12619657,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,Jim Halpert,"I will be the first to admit that when I beat The Walking Dead: Season 1, I not only cried, but I cried like a baby. The story, setting, and, most importantly, the characters all pulled me into this world where no one is truly safe, and your decisions matter and go beyond the ""choice 1 = good-but-risky, choice 2 = evil-but-conserative"" trope. So when Season 2 was announced, I was eager to get my hands on it. Now, ten months have passed and the season is over, ending with ""Episode 5: No Going Back"". Was it amazing, and how did it stack against Season 1?First off is the actual game(i.e. graphics, gameplay, etc.) The graphics maintain the same visual style as Season 1, but look a lot better, and a little less rough around the edges. There is occasional pop-in when the game just loaded, but this normally isn't the case as long as you don't fail any of the gameplay. Speaking of which, the gameplay has changed for the better, especially action sequences. As much as I loved Season 1, I will say  that the action parts could've been better. In Season 2, though, they are just plain grand, and Episode 2 has prehaps the best action sequence across both seasons. Also, unlike the majority of Season 1, Season 2 has a full soundtrack that plays the right music at the right time, fitting the mood and tone. No matter the gameplay advances, though: if you're playing this game, it's for the story.(Note: I will try to be as spoiler-free as I can; however, if there is one, don't say I didn't warn you.) The season opens up with a bang, reminding you in the first five minutes that this isn't some cheery game where everyone is happy: this is the Walking Dead, and people- notably the ones you love- are going to die. Events transpire and leave an 11-year old Clementine alone and starving, and when she meets a new group, can she trust them? As the plot carries on, new (and old) characters are introduced, and you eventually have to decide which is better: appealing to your pathos(emotions) or your logos(logic), and this choice not only sets up Clementine for her future, but also kind of defines you as a person to an extent. This season sees you playing as Clem, and whoever came up with this idea is an absolute genious. Clementine is just a little girl, and while at moments she may seem empowering, she is still just a kid and can't influence everything to go her way. However, as those who've played Season 1 know, Lee did not leave Clem helpless. She can survive, and does so often to the point where a specific, boating character comments that ""[Clementine] survive[s] better than any three adults put together"". As a kid, your power in combat won't be as direct, as she is considerably weaker (physically) than most of the walkers and other survivors. Instead, she uses dexterity and her environment to win. And of couse, this being The Walking Dead, dialouge and character-connecting is the focus here. As only one character from Season 1 re-appears, most of the people you're talking with are people you only met recently, and how you interact with them could affect their trust in you.When the characters die in this season, none of them are quite like saying goodbye in Season 1, but its not supposed to: you've only knew this people for a week or two, so you're not going to get bonded with them as much as you did with Lee and Clem last season. Nonetheless, you will find yourself liking some characters over others. Instead of trying to decimate your heart, Season 2 more leaves an uneasy, queasy felling at the end of each episode, almost like ""Did I make the right choice? Is there something I could've done differently?"", and it's hard to shake off this feeling. So, think of it like this: Season 1 was heart-breaking, and Season 2 is gut-wrentching survival.There are a total of five different endings for Season 2, and they all define who your Clementine is and who she will become. While none of the endings are exactly happy, one left me actually feeling heart-warmed, one left me bitter-sweet, another left me worried for the future, and the last two were not-so-good as the other two good ones (for those of you who know, the two not-so-good ones are both of Jane's endings).However, I felt that the game had done a very good job creating a tale of growing up. Most of the decisions that Clem has to make are the same type (albiet without the whole zombie and survival part) that we ourselves make as kids that determine who we are. Tell Tale Games has recently confirmed Season 3's existence. If Season 1 was finding and teaching Clem, and Season 2 was molding and shaping her, I think it's safe to say that Season 3 will be seeing that shape and how it effects her views and opinions, which should be enticing for any fan. So, is Season 2 better than Seaon 1? In the end, yes, most definatly yes.I hope that I can continue to be there for Clementine as she goes through this jam, and I can't wait to see what directions it takes her in..."

,Recommended,261030,8576565,"Posted: 5 January, 2014",all,[AReV]Nomed,"Season two marks the next chapter in Telltale’s The Walking Dead.The Walking Dead emphasizes narrative and character development over all else. If you’re looking for solid gameplay, you may be disappointed in that regard. On the other hand though, TWD excels at providing an engaging story and features extremely likable characters. It plays out in the form of a point and click adventure game which feels a lot like an interactive movie. There are no puzzles, and the gameplay is handled through quick time events most of the time.Season two continues shortly after where the first left off and this time you’ll be playing as Clementine opposed to Lee. Seeing the world through the eyes of a little girl immediately makes the game feel more depressing and hopeless as she has to fend for herself now. The zombies, which felt fairly weak in season one are suddenly a much more dangerous threat for Clementine to deal with as well.The story telling is second to none; however my main issue with The Walking Dead is the whole illusion of choice aspect. At the time of this review, only the first episode of season two is available but this problem was quite prevalent in season one. At first glance, the game will make you feel as if your choices have a major influence on the story. Upon further investigation, you’ll realize that regardless of your choices, you’ll always be brought to the same conclusion. This makes The Walking Dead an extremely enjoyable experience the first time you play but it essentially eliminates any element of re-playability afterwards.If you’re looking for a great story, definitely check it out; just don’t expect to influence it much.For a more detailed review of Season Two, here’s a review video I made for episode One:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210486846If you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/"

,Recommended,261030,8412424,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,AngryBoz68,"The Walking Dead Season 2 continues a short time after the events of Season 1, but this time, you play the role of Clementine instead of Lee.Season 2 continues with the same cell-shaded art style and narrative-driven formula that Telltale has used with Walking Dead Season 1.  There were some minor interface changes that improved the experience and felt very good once getting used to them.  Also Season 2 did appear to make it a point to get right into the action with a little less focus on the down time.  The tone of the game remained very much like that of Season 1.  Even though you are playing as the 11 year old Clementine, Telltale did not hold any punches in the story and many of the situations that you are placed in can be very unsettling.  I could definitely see the difference in the character, and how she has grown as a survivor, with all of the innocence of a normal child her age long gone.  Just like in Season 1 you just don't know whether the living or the dead are the bigger threat to you, and there are a couple of really heartbreaking moments right out of the gate.Decisions from Season 1 and the 400 Days DLC are imported if you choose and the events of Season 2 will be altered based on those prior choices.  While Season 2 can be started without playing the prior season, I highly recommend doing Season 1 first so that you have a better understanding of what is happening and to have your choices imported rather than being randomly selected for you.And like Season 1, if you are an achievement hunter, it seems that the achievements will come simply by playing through the game, so it is very easy to get 100%.The music sets the mood for the game appropriately.  And dang, that song ""In the Water"" that is played during the end credits...Anxiously looking forward to the upcoming episodes for this season."

Here's why:I didn't expect my choices to matter much. They didn't matter much in the first game. Even less so here, and that's fine.Why I bought the game was for a quality story with well-written, fleshed out characters and an interesting plot. That's where the game falls short, for me.Without divulging spoilers I'll simply point out a few things.- The adults in this game are shallow, vapid and near-idiotic humans who seem unable to make even the most minor decision without consulting an 8 year old girl. That this was done as a means of getting you, the character, involved seems obvious.  But the writers forego any attempt at logic or reason in the method they chose to get you involved.  The group doesn't know whether to trust person X.  ""Clem, what do you think?""  The group isn't sure where to go to avoid the next traumatic event or to deal with a current situation. ""What should we do, Clem?""  In this sense the adults nearly all only exist as a means to an end, the end being making you feel as if the things you say and do matter.  They don't. Most people familiar with the first game know they don't matter. Keeping up the pretense at this point comes at the expense of actually having to make these characters think and act like... people.- Likewise there's inconsistency in their behavior. For the most part you, Clem, will be the voice of reason, the arbiter of justice, the pacifier of aggression, etc.  Until the game feels it's time to remind you that you're just a little girl, again. At that point the rest of it goes out the window and the adults are suddenly knowledgeable and efficient and wise and you're just a wee little lass who's lost and alone and probably needs a hug, yeah?   Okay. Humans are inconsistent, self-contradictory, forgetful, all of those things. The trouble is the writers didn't bother to put any sort of justification in to explain this idea or expound on it, with one or two exceptions.  There are a couple of decent characters here whose inconsistency and reluctance to make hard decisions is directly tied to their past experience. The rest not so much, if at all.- The dialogue choices I was given often left me wondering whether the people writing them in one scene were at all aware of the things written in other scenes.  You're presented with a choice at one point, say, and then later that situation is referenced, but you're given no option at all to remind anyone of the previous conversation or interaction or meeting or whatever it was.  It completely pulls you out of any immersion in the story, and leaves you feeling as if you could just as easly have clicked things at random as they popped up.  Again, this isn't about making a difference in the overall plot or the fate of any particular person. It's about consistency, and it misses the mark in a big way for me.In short, at full price the game doesn't even stack up to the first Season, much less improve.  If you can get it on sale at half price... yeah, sure, as long as you don't expect too much from it in the way of a compelling cast of characters that you'll get invested in, or consistency in their behavior and atittudes.   Otherwise, save your money for something else."

,Recommended,261030,15525667,"Posted: 24 April, 2015",all,Crona (Lust),"“I know Lee would die for this game”Speed 3.5/5 - Speed varies depending on how fast you want to complete the game, I felt like this season was shorter than the last one but sometimes speed isn’t that much of a factor when playing. Some episodes felt like they were taking forever to finish but overall it was not that bad.Graphics 5/5 - Graphics for this game were slightly better than the last game but mainly stayed on the same level. I haven’t played as many games as other gamers have but I though the graphics for both games were amazing, I give props to the designers.Story line 6/5- Amazing storyline, just as good as the last one but I felt that this one went more into depth with certain characters. More of the characters had back story which really makes this game a must play. Compared to the first game it has more suspense and what I felt was an overall better story progression in where they tried to tell what happened to every character.Horror2/5- Some jump scares but they are very slight, it’s not really a horror game like Outlast. I am a fan of Horror and love blood and gore, and while there was some blood and gore I felt like there could have been more.Action 4.5/5 -While this is not like a typical action (being where you are doing the moves yourself) game I found that it had its moments, most of the actions came from the decisions you made both verbally and physically. The more decisions you make the more action you tend to receive depending on the story.Suspense 5/5- Very suspenseful, makes you question what is going to happen next just like in the first installment. Playing the game while the stores were still being release made me mad because I wanted to find out what happened next. It was frustrating because when I was on the edge of my seat the on the next episode of the game would pop up. To make things my frustrating there is news of a Walking Dead Season 3 game said to be released in December so the means more waiting for us.If you are a fan of the Walking Dead video game then I recommend the second installment of the series, I have played both and personally I believe season 2 is something that can definitely compete with season 1. I have spent up to forty five hours playing both games and have gotten all of the achievements for both of the games, and it was worth every second that I played.If you remember in the first walking dead you played as Lee, a father like figure who is constantly watching out for Clementine, a small girl whose parents left her at home when they went on vacation. As the story progressed you grow attached to the characters especially Lee and Clementine but depending on which root you choose you are left seeing Clementine surviving on her own. In this season you play as Clementine as she survives through new dangers and experiences while she grows up in this apocalyptic society.  She is constantly outsmarting the adults around her, which in my opinion shows that she adapted well to the society and that Lees death wasn’t in vain. In each danger or crisis you once again have to make decisions that will not only affect Clementine but the other characters around her. Overall it was an amazing game for both the first and second seasons and I recommend this game to all of my family and friends. Here were some things that I thought the gamer could expect when playing the Season 2 of the Walking Dead game:What to expect-	Blood and gore, while not as bad as the game Outlast there is still slight blood and gore-	A child constantly outsmarting the adults that she is around-	New characters will great back stories that make us question the decisions that we make-	Zombies, as the mentions this is the Walking Dead so zombies are a given-	Tears , keep a box of tissues handy people trust me it can be sad at timesWhat not to expect-	Do not expect it to be like the TV series, they are two separate matters and have completely different characters. Sorry but there will be no Daryl Dixon, or Rick Grimes in this game.-	Butterflies and sunshine, it’s a Zombie apocalypse the only way you get that is if you die.-	A season three anytime soon, the earliest they stated its going to be released is by December 2015 and knowing them it will probably be longer than that.-	Lee coming back riding on a horse like a knight to save clementine.-	MMO and competitive game play, this is not like CSGO or COD, if you are looking for this , it’s not your gameWhat type of computer it takes to run:http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyriI recommend this cite if you are not sure how your computer runs to see if your computer can handle running the game. It is a trusted cite that I myself have used many times on my old computers to make sure they could run the game."
76561198030080447,Recommended,261030,33951527,Posted: 1 August,all,PrinzEugen,"Having enjoyed the first season ofThe Walking Deadimmensely, I put off playing the second one for a couple of years - mostly out of concern that after so brilliant a game, the sequel could only fall short of its predecessor.I am very glad to report that I was completely wrong: this second season is just as captivating as the first one; it dragged me into its story and managed to get under my skin effortless. Just like in any Telltale-game, the story receives main forcus and the success of the game mostly depends on it. This second season picks up a couple of months after the end of the first one and continues the story of the young orphan Clementine, who tries to survive in a world plunged into ruins due to a zombie outbreak and - even more so - to the cruelty and madness of some of the survivors. The story is original, well told and doesn't involve too many distracting twists and turns.Clementine is a very particular kind of game-protagonist. Being a young girl, she is likeable, even cute on first sight, and evoked strong feelings of compassion during the early stages of the game. But as she gets confronted with more and more (especially human) cruelty, she definitely hardens up and quickly develops a tough, even harsh part of herself. During the game the player can of course through all kind of decisions direct the way in which Clementine not only lives through the story, but also develops as a human being, up to a certain degree.Even if one would choose all the ""sweet"" and ""understanding"" options in the dialogues, at a deep level the development of Clementine definitely is one away from being a little, depending girl towards a more mature character. This by itself is quite a thing to achieve in any work of story-telling art, being a book, a theater play, a game or an opera. Characters are all too often one-sided, either good or bad, something which definitely doesn't apply to Clementine in this game. The other characters are a mixed bag. Some are believable and interesting, while others are too one-sided, or make too short an appearance to make much impact on the game. This might be my only point of real criticism: there are probably too many side-characters, whose story in only very briefly touched upon. This is something which is probably done on purpose to show how fleeting encounters are in a world like this, but it doesn't always work in a game.For the rest, the game shows all the strong points of a top-notch Telltale-product: excellent, sometimes even superb voice-acting, sober but effective comics-style graphics, perfectly suited music and an ominous soundtrack. There is not much else to say to anyone who hasn't played it yet: just do so, as it won't disappoint in the slightest.

,Recommended,261030,11923101,"Posted: 30 August, 2014",all,noibn,"Season 2 of The Walking Dead picks up a year or so after the events of the first game (needless to say, you should play that first if you haven't already). This time around, you play as Clementine, who is no longer the scared little girl from Season 1. Without spoiling anything important, the plot centers around a new group of survivors Clementine encounters, and the challenges they face.Gameplay is exactly the same as the previous game. You mostly choose between various dialogue options, with occasional breaks for action sequences (click the mouse on Walkers to kill them, mash the ""Q"" key really fast, etc). There's not much in the way of ""game"" here - it is simply an interactive story. As with the first season, the voice acting is top notch, and the visuals work very well for the game style. I have no complaints at all about any of the technical aspects of the game. On a side note, if you import your save files from Season 1 and/or the 400 Days DLC, the choices you made in those stories will be reflected in Season 2. This is a nice touch. Unfortunately, in the case of 400 Days, the results are mostly inconsequential, which felt like a letdown.What makes Season 2 different is the new cast of characters. Unfortunately, that's also the game's biggest issue. For whatever reason, I just never felt a big connection to anyone in this game, except Clementine (and one other person, which I won’t spoil for plot reasons). I can’t really place my finger on why this is. Maybe it's a combination of the novelty of the first game having worn off, and pretty much knowing exactly what to expect out of the Walking Dead universe by now. I'm not sure. None of this is to say the characters or the plot are outright bad by any stretch. That's not the case at all. I just didn’t feel as involved in or as attached to any of the characters as I did in the previous game.That said, there are some genuinely good moments across the 5 episodes, and plenty of those patented Tough Choices (tm.) that have become the hallmark of the series. The highlight is Clementine, who ends up being a great protagonist. It's great to continue her story and see her progression from child to adult under unthinkable circumstances. Overall, I enjoyed the game, and it’s well worth playing for anyone who enjoyed Season 1. I always felt the legacy of the first game would be hard to live up to, and that proved to be true - just go into Season 2 with lowered expectations and you probably won’t be disappointed."

,Recommended,261030,16717941,"Posted: 26 June, 2015",all,Senno,"A stirring and well-acted journey, Season Two of The Walking Dead may not deliver the breakthrough experience of the first season, yet it retains the emotional punch that makes this undertaking just as heartfelt and gut-wrenching as we all so fondly remember. Each episode builds upon the last, and we open with the slightly older and more experienced Clementine being once again ripped from the last vestige of Season One’s survivors. These initial scenes, when Clementine is truly at her most vulnerable, allow new characters and personalities to fill the void, and they are definitely a step up from those that we have love and lost before.I would actually state that new characters such as Luke, Rebecca and the reprehensible Carver create a far bigger impression and provide a longer lasting memory. The performances by the voice actors is incredibly top notch, and the screams from Sarita during a particularly grisly moment are some of the best acting this medium can produce. By the end of Season Two Clementine and the other survivors will have experienced levity, horror, fear, love, friendship, anger and many other emotions beside, with a strong cast that have truly become their characters.But among it all, there is Clementine. By the end of Season One you loved this little girl, and you wanted to protect her from the horror that has become of the world. Put into the spotlight herself, she thrives as a character in and of herself. Through the course of Season Two we see her grow, mature and even command the respect of those much older. She is strong-willed and can even have a lick of malice, depending on your actions. It’s a thrill to see her change and be changed because of the actions of others, and she can be both the voice of reason and the voice of spite.As with Season One, the dialogue is the main gameplay element that will take up the most of your time. While engaged with the other characters there are usually four options and a timer to quickly speak. Staying silent is also an option, and what you say, how you say it, and if you choose to speak at all can place other character’s lives in your hands. You cannot mull over your responses, weighing the pros and cons over your eventual choice – the game’s dialogue is fast-paced and demanding, and can have an intensity that other games couldn’t even begin to touch. This dynamic is as much a source of tension as the ever-present zombies, and these choices do affect how some situations play out.However, beyond dialogue, there remains a noticeable lack of direct interaction in The Walking Dead Season Two. Opportunities to explore the varied settings are far and few between, and these settings are much smaller than they appear at first glance. It’s hard to feel engrossed in the environment when you spend the vast amount of your gameplay ignoring it and talking to the next character to advance the plot. Quick-time events do vary the action on occasion, but the pacing of the gameplay is rather ho-hum.Despite these concerns, Season Two is still a strong enough experience to merit your time. Clementine’s story is enough to carry the game through any interactive short-comings. The quality of the experience is measured through how torn you feel when a beloved character is inevitably killed. While Season Two doesn’t have the impact that Season One has made – it is another strong showing from the great storytellers at Telltale and comes highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed Season One.8.0/10"

,Recommended,261030,23790000,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,Cinetyk,"After the superb Season 1, which turned out to be one of the most emotional stories I ever experienced, it was going to be hard to raise the bar, understandably.I felt this season to be a little less impactful, mainly because something like the relationship between Lee and Clementine, which made the bulk of the strength and emotional resonance of Season 1, is not present. Theirs was truly special and made for a magical story. Connection with other characters this time around feels a bit less strong, mainly because there's much more chaos this time, their situation is always dangerous and things change very fast. This actually makes sense in this world, but overall I felt that character development and relationships between characters suffered for it.That being said, though, there are still all the emotional moments and tough decisions that make you feel your choices very acutely, which is still the main focus of the game. Actually, deciding who to trust, who to follow, what to do is even stronger this time around, as you will be put in the middle of different people and situations and how you choose to interact has different reactions and consequences. Once again, Telltale are masters of the ""shades of grey"" in regards to every character and dialogue, nothing is linear and obvious, making the experience very engaging. There's also a few different endings this time around, which are interesting to explore and make it so your late game decisions do really have consequences.The main take away from this season, though, was Clementine: how much she grows in every way as she shifts from being a little girl in understandable need of protection into the beginnings of a capable, prepared and charismatic person, in spite of being only 11.In conclusion, though I felt that this season was slightly less strong than the stellar first one, there are still lots of emotional moments and tough decisions as you'd expect. And watching Clementine develop and go through everything she goes through, mostly bad and difficult, granted, was a delight."

I knew Telltale wouldn't be able to make lightning strike twice, but I had at least expected the quality to be close to the first episode. It wasn't. Especially starting Episode 4, the game really herps itself beyond all derp.Without spoiling overmuch, the game's shoddy writing becomes painfully apparent when you realize that your input, as a player, doesn't mean anything. Characters you choose to save get killed off a few minutes later anyway, and characters get a bridge dropped on them as soon as the game feels like shifting the conflict between two different characters. In between is Clementine, who has become a massive Mary Sue in this game, in that everyone wants to win her for themselves - but somehow, no one is actually influenced by what Clementine says or does. Because the game is going for one particular outcome and by God, you are going to GET that particular outcome!Plot holes abound, and the game keeps trying to go for a cheap Player Punch, and it grates. Especially the conclusion, which is transparent and obvious from miles away - but Hell if Clementine (the character they ALL listen to) can stop anything from happening, since she's utterly useless and only serves as a spectator. Telltale wanted to tell THEIR story, and the player isn't being put in control, but simply dealt with.Please think twice before you buy, and if in doubt, get the Wolf Among Us instead, because THAT is quality worthy of Telltale."

I know, I am the player, I have to do the dirty work, but you have to make it LOOK BELIEVABLE.

Now, the focus is set on an older Clementine, as more or less 2 years passed since TWD: Season 1. It means mainly that as she's still a kid, while there is still action, the game is more about survival, stealth and less about saving people or sparing (or not) lives, even if Clementine will be confronted to some though choices that may be a life or a death sentence.The game is like the first one: you're looking around, you're taking items with you and you talk a lot. Your choices will impact the game, though everything done before will have a minimal impact in the fifth episode. So, yeah, if you're expecting different endings, there are only 3 major endings and in two of them, you have a decision to make that will result in two sub-endings. You'll tell me that it was the same case in the first game, but your relationship with everyone had an impact in the beginning of the fifth episode. Here, there is none apart from an episode to another (a character that lives will appear if he wasn't killed before for example). Even if you choose one action on another and decide to rewind the chapter and do the contrary, you'll end up with the same reaction, which means that some choices aren't really impacting the game.Here's the brief story of each episode. I'm trying not to spoil you on it, though, as the game is relying also on your emotions.After the events in the first season, Clementine is now travelling with Christa. However, some bandits separate them and Clementine finds herself alone in a forest. She meets a group but what will happen?In the second episode, Clementine is now integrated with the group, though they lost a member. However, the visit of their enemy Carver will make them leave the cabin. Now being pursued by Carver, will they find some help? And what will be in store with Clementine? Will she find a friend that she thought was lost a long time ago?In the third episode, the group is captured by Carver and comes back to the shelter they left months ago though. How will they manage to escape? Who is willing to help them? Why Carver is interested in Clementine?In the fourth episode, the escape didn't go as smoothly as they thought. But Rebecca is ready to have her kid, some members are still missing and you need items to prepare the birth. And one of your friends really needs to get out of his grief...In the fifth episode, after the encounter with the Russians prompted by the lies of one of their members, the group is trying to find a shelter in the winter, with a baby. Your long-time friend is showing more and more his bad side. What will happen to Clementine?The story is well-written and relying on the feelings you may experience. The fact that now, you're the little girl is also playing a great part of it. You want her to be safe and generally, you're driven by the fact that as she's still a kid, you need her to be a little naive or innocent. However, the options in the game allow you to make a character that has seen so much in life that she can be hard and react as an adult. But Clementine can also be by herself and way more mature than some adults in the game. Even when afraid, she's not giving up (besides, if you want to advance in the story, you don't have a choice in the matter).The graphiscs didn't change from the first game, it's still in a cell-shading look. However, the season isn't the same: we're at the end of fall, beginning of the winter. TWD was more set during late spring/summer and was ending at fall. However, this factor isn't really important per se but it's nice to see different landscapes, some with snows. Besides, as usual, the game is making you move around, though the episodes isn't set in a town or around it, here, you're really in the forest, more in the wild than TWD.The soundtrack is as usual good and fitting to the ambiance, after all, you're in a post-apocalyptic world if I may say. And you're confronted to an harsh reality.Anyway, in the end, TWD: Season 2 didn't really bring something new apart the change of protagonist, going with the change of the ""scope"". But if you like TWD, you'll like this game too. If you like TTG's way, you'll like this one too. If I recommend the game? Sure, I bought the season from episode 1 and suffered the patience to wait for each episode. And it was a joy when the game was updated. But at least, TWD: Season 2 is putting you in the shoes of a kid in TWD's universe and only for that, you need it. Besides, as usual, with choices to make, you can replay a lot the game after to make the story that will be the much better for you, though myself, I tend to stick to my personality and I don't want to make a Clementine that isn't caring a little."

Not absolutely outstanding but it had me laughing and crying and I enjoyed it. The puzzles were great, the choices I had to make were difficult and I was always on edge, the characters were well written and I was in tears by the end. This season has been...nothing but a disappointment. I'm not even sorry for saying that.Secondly, I didn't care about anyone in this season. Literally no one. What I usually say is that Season One was great as I played as Lee and I was always worried about Clem because she was young and I felt very protective of her (as someone with a younger sibling it was easy to fit that role). This season, playing as Clem, I wasn't worried about her anymore. I was supposed to worry about the others in my group and I hated everyone else, I can't think of one character this season that I liked. Now, obviously, that's my opinion, but still. It ruined the story for me. I didn't care who died, I wasn't worried.Lastly, this season was more of a movie or something. I was constantly just sitting around watching characters I hated having conversations that I didn't care about and I felt so incredibly bored. The choices I got to make during conversations were useless. I could have just sat silent through the whole thing and it wouldn't have made a difference in the long run.Buy it if it's on sale I guess, but I'd just recommend watching someone else play it or go read the wiki if you wanna know what happens. I don't plan on playing the next season anyway, that's the main thing, and that sucks because I was so excited for this season and it just wasn't worth playing imo.TL;DR - This season was basically 90% walking and talking and 10% actually doing anything of interest, and I'd have had more fun reading the wiki than actually playing this."

You survive this season with a bunch of incompetent, overly emotional fools and sycophants.That all said, it was much the sameness from the first season and it was enjoyable, just not to the same extent that the first season was."

Throughout the enourmous trek of this game your group becomes more and more dysfunctional, fights and disputes start between fellow group members and you learn that Clementine is most likely more capable than all of them combined. It accurately reflects on what states people are capable on going through under certain conditions and the extent they'd take to survive. Decisions  are especially difficult in this game particuarly when choosing who to appeal to and whether to be selfless and get yourself into danger or let the others take the blame. (Also the game restores your previous save from The Walking Dead Season 1 so your previous decisions will not go unaccounted for which makes it really feel like a continuation from the first game). Graphics are better than ever in this instalment and they have a real emphasis on the atmosphere in the game making the game beautiful to play through.

,Recommended,261030,19362686,"Posted: 29 November, 2015",all,Ƹ̵̡DRCLƷ Whitest Wolf,"After playing the first season of The Walking Dead, I just had to get season 2.I was in two minds about it, because I have heard from many people that it isn't as good as the first season, and it's not nearly as worth it. Since the people I have heard this from were mostly close friends I believed them, but wanted to give it a try anyway, because that first season was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had in gaming, and I don't typically like point and click games.So I bought it while on sale, and I can tell you right now, all those people who said the game wasn't good were just flat out wrong. It is a matter of personal opinion, but in my opinion, the second season is just as good as the first.I can't say that this sequel is better than the first season, but only because the first season was so incredibly good. But it is not worse either.I am going to avoid all spoilers, which is going to make this maybe slightly vague, but I will do my best to explain why this is just as good.The characters in the second season are just as lovable as in the first. At first you might not realize this, but it is true. The game takes a few characters from the first season and masterfully blends them into a whole new world of new people. You will miss some of the people from season one. That much is certain. But the new characters, and the interactions between them and characters of old, does a good job at making up for it.You might also not feel at first glance like your choices make much of a difference, but you will find that the story actually fans out much more than in the first season, and your ending can be completely different than that of others.And I assure you the end will be very satisfying. As I said in my review for the first season, this game will tear out your heart, rip it to pieces, then clumsily glue it together, and feed it back to you. It is the ultimate masochist experience.I have reached two different endings in this game and I am so amazed by how different they are. The first one left me just shocked, not even sure if I want to replay it. I barely made myself retry the ending, and I am so glad I did so now.You will just have to try it yourself, and don't listen to what other people are saying, it is likely they got an ending which was not as satisfying, or didn't even give the game a fair chance. It is just as good as the first, in other ways perhaps, but just as good.So if you want to go on the emotional rollercoaster of a lifetime (again), get this game."

An interactive movie-like game with harder and faster decisions to make every time you advance in the storyline. Expectional story writing based on Robert Kirkman's comics, amazing soundtrack. This game makes you take hard decisions, in a maximum of probably 10 seconds each, decisions which all have powerful consequences behind them. You take full responsibility to what might happen after you take the decision and you're afraid of what it might cause, but it also makes you proud of your decisions. You tail how Clemetine's character is, how others see you. It brings out your smartest moves, your worst fears and your craziest sides you didn't even know you had.Once you buy the game on Steam you get all the episodes as they come out. Each decision counts, the ones from Season 1 and the DLC aswell. So I suggest buying those before playing this game. Not only the story will make more sense but you'll be more attached to the characters and you'd be happy to know that your past decisions are being counted aswell.So there you have it, action, tension, regret, joy, sadness.

I reserve the right to spoil things that you would know by the time you play Season 2.Episode 1One of the things that I was most excited about was the fact that the decisions I made during Season 1 would carry over and have an impact in Season 2. And indeed, the game found my save files and imported them properly, but I didn't notice anything during the first episode that had anything to do with what I had done during Season 1.Being that Clementine is a lot smaller than Lee, the combat played out much differently. Instead of struggling with the zombies and trying to bash their heads in, Clementine usually runs and dodges away from whatever is chasing her. There were also far fewer puzzles, and those that were present were fairly straightforward. Honestly most of the episode was a continuous push forward, with few hub areas to simply explore and talk to people.Overall I would call this episode a setup episode. Telling you what it is setting up would be a spoiler, but it might be in your best interest to wait and find out how good the next episode is before deciding whether or not to buy the whole season.Episode 2I wasn't really sure what to expect from the second episode because the first episode didn't have much going on in it. I didn't know enough about the group of people I met to make predictions about what was going to happen. Luckily the second episode picks things up; well, it's not lucky for the characters in the game, but you know what I mean.The most important thing that happens in this episode is the people in your new group get fleshed out more in a big way.The Walking Deadwould fail completely if it didn't have strong characters that you care about. I found myself drawn to the people in the group to varying degrees, much as I would in real life.The biggest challenge Telltale faces in this game is finding ways to give the player agency in ways that make sense for an 11 year old girl. For the most part I think they succeeded, though there were a few exceptions; for example, who would leave Clementine alone to figure out how to turn off a wind turbine?Unfortunately I cannot go into the best things about this episode without spoiling everything, but trust me:The Walking Dead 2is officially now worth getting. There were a lot of surprises, which I was not expecting. I thought I was prepared for anything that Telltale could throw at me, but I was very wrong.Much like the first episode, they end with a huge cliffhanger. If you hate dealing with those, you might want to wait until the third episode comes out, but that will probably end on a cliffhanger as well. I'm enjoying playing it one episode at a time, but I wish I had somebody I could discuss things with.Episode 3This episode was structured very differently from the other episodes we've seen so far fromThe Walking Dead. It almost felt like the story it told could stand on its own, with some fleshing out of course. In particular the ending had so much closure I'm not sure where they are going to take the series next, other than the obvious problem of continuing to survive in a zombie apocalypse.My favorite thing about this episode was how Clementine really came into her own. In previous episodes the writers came up with ways for her to influence events without being the main actor. Here she does almost everything that is needed for the group's plans to work. Of course one of the characters brings up how crazy this is, so the writers were not unaware of the stretch they were taking here. I hope this opens up the door for Clementine to do even more cool stuff.I believe that I have now seen all of the characters from the 400 Days DLC, though most of them showed up briefly and had very few lines. I am looking forward to seeing them more in future episodes. If Telltale doesn't use them more I am going to be pretty disappointed.This episode didn't let up on The Walking Dead's tendency to be emotionally taxing. I kept alternating between cheering characters on and cursing at the screen when things went wrong. And that's just the way I like it.Episode 4Amid the Ruinsbrings us back to the more familiar Telltale formula, with action sequences interspersed with characters talking while walking and even a hub area where you can take a break and look around a Civil War memorial.I mentioned in the last episode that Clementine carried the group in a way that is not normal for an 11 year old girl. This episode did feature Clementine contributing heavily, but not in ways that felt forced by the writers. The flow and pace of the episode felt much more natural, with almost no moments that pulled me out of the game.There were even a few genuinely humorous moments, mostly provided by my new favorite character, Mike. I wish he had gotten a chance to shine earlier, and I certainly hope that they do not kill him off. Small chance of that.Episode 5I was hoping that I would be able to make it through a season finale ofThe Walking Deadwithout making any decisions I immediately regretted or crying. I failed. It was a fool's hope anyway.Much like the finale of season one, there were very few times where they give the player the opportunity to take a break and look around. It was mostly a constant push towards the end of the episode. They did give the characters a break at one point, which also let me become more attached to them. This was no doubt part of their grand plan to break my heart, but those are not things that you realize while playing.There was one situation that I saw coming from a mile away because the writers focused on it so much for the last couple of episodes. On the other hand there was another closely related situation that I did not see coming at all.As a whole I enjoyed the second season of Telltale's The Walking Dead, though not as much as the first season. I would say that the main factor was the faster turnover of characters. I did not get enough time to get attached to most of the characters before they died or were otherwise removed from the group. I cannot remember many of their names, or how they died. In contrast I remember almost all of the characters from season one.I am not sure if Telltale will make a third season, and frankly I am not sure how wise it would be for them to try. It is easy for the player to become jaded to the loss they are constantly subjected to in this series. The second season also had much less of a cultural impact; out of my Steam friends, the number of people who have played the second season is less than half that of the first. I would certainly play a third if they made it though."

Paticularly in the sense that I felt that the choices you make have less impact on the progression of your story, to the point that the game makes a big deal about giving you the chance to save some characters, only to ignore them for almost an entire chapter before they die anyway. Some of the conflict feels more forced as well, with some characters performing complete 180-degree changes in their attitude because someone needs to start a fight to make things interesting.But, that's a lot of criticism for what is still an excellent game. The first two chapters are superb and utterly harrowing, there are quite a number of possible endings and you have complete freedom to decide, and the shift of focus to Clementine as a playable character was an inspired decision."

Clementine is more exposed and vulnerable than Lee was - she is after all still a child. But she's not just physical plant since the first game. Here she is more capable : able to handle weapons, use the environment to their advantage and have basic survival skills . This requires the need that she must use their accumulated knowledge to cope.How and what I choose Clementine to say or do will have consequences later on. These choices - that must be done on time, is the essence of the game. The moral choices are of course the most exhausting. Should I help a character or not? Who should I save the life of? There is no right answer. But as the game quickly and well manage to establish the characters, there is an emotional effort on my part, that makes these choices grab. It gets heavy, ruthless and crippling to see terrible events pass and know that I could have chosen differently.Clementine is superbly written, feels incredibly human in their desperation and loneliness, and proves at the same time smart, stubborn and have good instincts. Clementine was in the last game chiselled sympathetic and courageous.

How many times have you made a decision in a game, and regretted it (while knowing full well that you made the right choice for yourself, or for the greater good, whatever your perspective). If you are willing to let yourself play a game and feel these, and other emotions, The Walking Dead: Season 2 is for you.I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1 and was pleased to play this through, often so engrossed in the story that I would play through an entire chapter at a time. The writing is tremendous, the characters are interesting (and often tragic), and the gameplay, while not twitchy, is satisfying for how it can make you feel as if you are a real part of the story.I realise that you likely have read a dozen other reviews praising this game, and that you know how amazing it already is, but this is as much for me as it is for you - I will not feel complete until I have recommended this title to the public, and maybe, just maybe, helped another person experience this masterpiece."

Definitely a must play if you played the first season. The story is well-written, unpredictable and has some twists. Not going to cover much about the story, you just have to see to believe it ;)I can't really find any flaws to this game, and that's the reason I give this game a perfect score. Please forgive me if I overlooked at some cons in this game, I just couldn't find them.In conclusion, buy this game if you liked season 1, if not, don't buy it becasue if has the same formula as the first game.**PRO TIP: Sorry for the minor spoiler but if you want to have the BEST ENDING, I strongly recommend you to stick with Kenny."

It is no longer an adventure game meant to cause the player to reflect on how their values hold up when pushed to the limits (a stressful post-apocalyptic setting where ideals are never realized).  Instead, it is a 3D virtual novel with very little agency at all.  It was very rare that Lee ever did anything that directly conflicted with my agency.  However, Clementine's options never seem to fit how I want to react, and many situations are not only uninteresting, but simply convenient writing.Also, although this is not an inherently negative aspect, each episode takes substantially less time to complete than the previous game, so on top of being unsatisfied with the content, I'm also getting less of it to judge it on.  Unfortunately, I regret my purchase quite a bit.  I don't feel down that I'm out $20; I'll gladly add that to them as extra payment for how great the first game was.  Instead, I feel cheated on the time I invested into the game.  No, you should not carbony copy a game when making a sequel, but this really isn't even in the same realm as the first game."

The puzzle situations are not hard nor are they long which helps a story heavy game like this keep moving at a steady pace. Most of them are, find the item and use it on whats blocking you, or use items in a certain order. You can explore around most areas and find other things to interact with in the world and sometimes may find another way to solve a problem. Quick time events will happen during some cutscenes, but are not to bad to react too(lots of mash Q then press E)For the most part the gameplay is your average point and click adventure game with the addition of quick time events.GraphicsThe art design is the beautiful cell shaded art that we come to know and love from TellTale. The levels and areas are well designed and gorgeous to look at. The characters are well crafted and fit perfectly into the world around them. Cutscenes look smooth on my medium spec PC and have no framerate issues, even my girlfriend runs this game smoothly on her low end PC.AudioAudio is well done and makes you feel part of the world whether it be the stumbling feet of zombies from the world around you or the sweet ambience sound of the forest. The voice acting is well done and the voices fit the characters they were chosen for. The emotion is made aparent through the voice acting.StoryI'm not going to give any information about the story line here, I will simply explain how the story line felt. The story line flowed smoothly and you can see the concequences of your actions take place, however I felt like no matter what choice you made their was no real ""saving them"", they would simply just die another way soon after. Also after playing through the game I felt like something was missing, I felt I had no real connection to any of the characters, they kind of just came and gone. This has to be my biggest issue with the game, this may have been because the story was not as intimate as Lee's and Clementine's was. I felt like TellTale just couldn't capture that same feeling in Season 2.SummaryAt the end of it all, The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a great game to pick up and play as it will take you through an amazingly well crafted story in a beautiful cell shaded design. Its hard to put down because the story keeps you engaged and you will find yourself wanting to keep going to find out what happens next. I would recommend playing the first season first as it will help you understand the storyline better and help show the changes made in clementine."

If it's an emotional rollercoaster you're looking for then you'll certainly find one here; just like the first season. Again, voice acting is among the very best in video games and the storyline is likewise engaging too. Against the original season, this one has comparatively shorter episodes, which is a shame – though they feel more streamlined with fewer filler-type puzzles this time around. The new group of characters may feel out of place at first but they quickly grow on you as you follow their plight. There are some brilliantly crafted surprises along the way too! The action-packed build up to the ending pays off; the climactic finale offers several branching paths that radically change the outcome of the story – offering a rewarding and genuinely satisfying conclusion to the season arc with superb character-defining moments. All in all, it was a ride I thoroughly enjoyed. Can’t wait for Season 3!"
,Recommended,261030,11966287,"Posted: 3 September, 2014",all,murderbits,"In my mind, Clementine's story ended in the last moments of the first season. I don't want more of her story. I want stories of other people. New ones every season. With that mindset, I entered Season Two by convincing myself this was a different character, despite the same name.Overall, the story is compelling enough to overcome the continued Tell Tale jank (graphical glitches, mechanics, interface, action sequences, cliche'd story pieces).There are a number of caveats, though. Even more than the first season or even Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead's Season Two feels like you have even less player agency. In fact, by the end of the game, it has driven you into a contrived situation where you are forced to make decisions you wouldn't want to make in a situation you wouldn't have allowed to happen all to manufacture shock in the final moments that fall short, because you keep saying ""but that's not what my decisions would have been... you just forced me down this path"". And, like other Tell Tale games, that is exactly what has happened. You made a series of largely inconsequential choices with no bearing on the overall tale.If you're willing to put up with some more Tell Tale Games jank and can get this at a discount at any number of points during the year, it is certainly worth experiencing. Just don't expect it to have the same impact it had the first time you entered The Walking Dead world via TTG a couple years ago. The luster has started to wear and I think we're  going to start seeing how long stories can overcome a lagging engine and mechanic, before that has to be improved and brought up to date."
,Recommended,261030,10173180,"Posted: 19 May, 2014",all,Rose,"The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a point and click adventure game based on Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead graphic novels. Season 1 gave us a hell of a ride on the feels train. Season Two now has Clementine taking the main role as the protagonist. She refers to what Lee taught her when she talks about her past experiences, which is a really important part of the story. It's what really links Season one and two together. Over the past few episodes of season two, the character development progresses one chapter at a time. The choices you make CAN effect the main story line, but some of these are small and won't set back the story at all. However, dire decisions where you have to choose between certain characters, whether they live or die, really adds the tension. When these dire choices happen, it will have you in a moment of slow-motion, then you have to act quickly as the decision bar runs out. The dialog is getting better and better each episode. However, I wish Telltale would make longer episodes once in a while. Sometimes they can seem short, but as they say; 'Time flies while you're having fun'. And Season Two so far, is proving that games don't need to be AAA, have groundbreaking graphics to be a good gaming experience. It's the story that draws us in, we want to find out what happens the next episode. We want to know how these choices affect our story and the characters themselves. Some characters will return from Season One and 400 Days. There will be twists and turns on this train track of feels, but Telltale does a damn good job!"
,Recommended,261030,12275960,"Posted: 28 September, 2014",all,Nighthawk,"PresentationOver the years, The Walking Dead became a huge franchise spawning multiple comic issues, a TV Show and numerous video game adaptations as well, including Telltale's story-focused adventure. Season 2 of The Walking Dead picks up a while after the ending of Season 1 as you take control of Clementine, the little girl you were trying to protect during the first season. This change of character also changes the way the story unfolds because as a kid you can't be the leader of a group anymore and the world looks and feels different seen through the eyes of a kid forced to grow up faster and stand by her decisions making the entire adventure much more gruesome and unforgiving. Just like in the previous season your choices affect how the story unfolds in the end, but unlike Season 1, this season focused more on the actual characters and what they are all about, meaning there was less interactivity with the environment and the constant movement from one location to the next one makes each location meaningless, without leaving many memories or things that you were attached to in that place. Season 2 pushes the boundaries of story telling in a game even further, packing high tension moments with drama, occasional comedy and those great cliffhangers at the end of each episode, making you constantly wonder what's going to happen next and giving you some sort of ideas on who you should expect to make it out alive, without actually spoiling it for you and even better surprising you when you were wrong.Rating: 9.5GameplayThe gameplay in The Walking Dead Season 2 differs very little from Season 1, borrowing some visual cues from The Wolf Among Us to make it feel more user-friendly, leaving the main things that made Season 1 so great to begin with untouched. While in Season 1 Lee's foot was bandaged pretty quickly and without showing too much this time around when it comes to bandaging a wound the game takes no step back when it comes to showing off just how harsh and gruesome the world can be seen through a kid's eyes. The rest of the game is still the same point and click open area sequence, allowing you to explore the world around you for a bit, then usually followed by a cutscene and some quick time events or a quick choice that you are forced to make in order to change the direction in which the game is headed for you in the next episode. It is once again interesting to see how much your story differs from your friends' and the fact that there are multiple endings once you reach the final moments of the season shows that the developers really meant it when they said the series adapts after your choices you make and even though throughout the first three episode that doesn't seem like a big game changer, by the end of the season, The Walking Dead manages to craft a unique story in the way you meant it when you made those choices.Rating: 9GraphicsThe graphics of this game still have the same comic book feel to them, but with the gore and violence levels turned up a little, making the experience feel like an adult focused struggle story of a young girl stuck with the entire world against her. The characters look good, but none of them are really memorable except for a couple of newcomers and some old friends. The usual problems that Telltale has are still here meaning that you will get the occasional frame rate dropping more or less depending on which platform you play on and the lip syncing is not always on spot, but these are small problems that won't affect your overall experience as you will be more interested in how the story unfolds.Rating: 8.5AudioThe first season had Lee and his deep voice that stuck with you for the course of the journey, and then there were some other characters who you could recognize instantly by the sound of their voice, but this time around it feels like the most memorable characters are actually old acquaintances like Bonnie from the 400 Days DLC and some other returning faces from Season 1, since as good as the voice acting is in Season 2, new characters lack the time and personality traits to make them feel unique and attached to your story The soundtrack is one of the greatest to date in a story-focused game, always leaving you with that perfect song at the end of each episode, making the choices you made have an even greater impact on you.Rating: 9ExtrasAfter finishing this season and knowing that there are multiple endings I wanted to go back and get the other ones, but in the end I decided that I will stick with my original choices no matter how I felt about them. The games that have more than one possible outcome usually want you to play again to get another one but here's not the case. While you could get all the endings by replaying just one small part, that would mean changing the save file for that and all the achievements are already there from your first playthrough since all of them are awarded for just completing a section of an episode, so it was just more convenient to look it up online and leave my save files alone.Rating: 8VerdictThe Walking Dead Season 2 is a good follow up to the huge success of Season 1, but in the end it felt a little weaker than before as the characters weren't as memorable as before, but the whole journey of Clementine alone is worth the purchase. If you like games where the story comes first this is the game for you; if you like zombie survival games this is also made for you, but most of all if you like Telltale Games this is definitely the game for you.Rating Overall: 8.8Check out the full review and a lot more about The Walking Dead: Season Two athttp://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=278"

You now control a 11 year old Clementine which makes the world feel even more dangerous since taking down a single walker takes multiple strikes because she lacks the strength to destroy the brain. It is a shame we don't get to play as 9 year old Clem and suddenly get a jump cut saying “16 months later”  with nothing else added on how she survived or what she went through when she was most vulnerable. That doesn't mean she won't be in danger though, as she will be receiving plenty of horrific injuries. Her voice is no longer high pitched and cute like in Season 1, she now sounds depressed after all the stuff she has been through. And since it has been so long after the outbreak most of the survivors are very selfish and jaded or just flatout insane.Nothing has really changed from Season 1 besides the story and a few new inputs during quick time events.  There are much less puzzles and less chances to talk to characters while walking around. They will usually just repeat one line and tell you to do something which helps keep up the pace of the game but also has less time to flesh out the characters.  It makes sense that they wouldn't want to converse with a little girl but it comes off as a bit silly how dependent they are on her at times. This time around they focus a lot more on human evil and pull it off very well. You will frequently feel intimidated by the insane people and more so by the people at your side as they start to lose it. Which brings me to the choices. It makes since that most people will ignore what you want to do but when you do make a choice it feels a lot less satisfying than in Season 1. They just feel lazy and the outcome will feel the same no matter what you pick, making it feel less like a choose your own adventure game and more like a point and click game with occasional dialogue choices.The game feels like it was rushed out before they could fine tune it to the quality of the first. Not that I'm saying it is a bad sequel though. I personally enjoyed it more than the first due to the helplessness of playing as a child. It is a very “fun” and tragic journey that I refuse to spoil here.  Not bad at all if you don't compare it to the original. Though one thing I just have to mention is that they make you sit through the credits that lists the whole staff and their pets five times. That's just unnecessary but at the very least they throw in some good music each time. Still if you liked the first season and want to know what happens next this is a very solid purchase that is every bit as emotional as the last season."

And so's that guy from the first season! Also, all the zombies from the first season are back.So I enjoyed it, but predictably I enjoyed it less than the first season. This is because the second season kind of didn't have a very consistent tone - the writing was not as strong this time around. The first season had a great hook - the zombie apocalypse was starting, everybody was still figuring out the Rules, everyone's become desperate refugees trying to survive in a world gone crazy, themes of parenthood, humanity, survival, all that good stuff.The second season is not as great in the storytelling department. Everybody's figured out the rules, the zombies are relentless and they show no signs of stopping (even after two years in, they rot but not enough to do something like fall apart), and the writers are trying to catch lightning in a bottle again by showing how Clementine grows up while many of her compatriots fall apart from stress unconvincingly. This is partly because the episodes have been shortened from two hours to 90 minutes, but also because I think the writers weren't doing so great a job here writing the characters in a consistent, believable manner. Come on, you survivor ♥♥♥♥ers, if an 11 year old is telling you how badly you're behaving and you ignore that then maybe I don't want to save you guys from being zombie chow.Carver (the antagonist of the survivalist community that the group has escaped from) had great moments, but he was killed off too early in my opinion. I would have loved to see him wading through a crowd of zombies going straight for the group for the later episodes. And the ending is kind of ♥♥♥♥ed and could have used a little more emotional balance other than KENNY IS CRAZY AND JANE KEEPS POINTING THAT OUT, WHO YOU GONNA TAKE TO THE ZOMBIE PROM? OOPS LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN PUNK'DAnyway, SOPHOMORE SLUMP but there's still these great, punchy emotional moments to be had by playing, and I still liked the story enough to not complain about the actual gameplay again, so I recommend it. I'm wary of how Season Three is going to turn out, though. It could be the emotional, weighty comeback that it needs (like a Return of the Jedi) or it could come home, stumbling drunk and fumbling through the napkins, reciting a bunch of drunken pablum about zombies before passing out on the kitchen floor (like a Superman 3)."

The story is interesting enough, but the choices and payoff are lackluster. Or at least the ending I got was. - 6/10 -*SPOILER WARNING*The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a good game. It looks good, it plays well, and makes me look forward to the third game coming later this year. That said, it isn't quite the continuation I had been hoping for. Season 1 was a fantastic game that had me enthralled from start to finish and in the end I was left in tears. Season 2 just doesn't have quite the same impact on me that the original had. As I progressed through the story I felt like many of my choices didn't matter. It really seemed like only the final choices had any real outcome. I didn't really connect with anyone quite as much as I had with Lee. I did try to care for some of the characters. Luke, Kenny, Jane, and Mike were the characters that at first interested me the most, however by the end I only cared to keep Clem safe and Jane seemed like the best choice for survival. I also wasn't particularly happy about the roles characters from 400 Days played. I wasted time trying to get them all to go to safety, but they ended up being either goons for Carver or traitors, in Bonnie's case. I bought and played this game quite a while after its original release so I knew some of the endings. I teared up a bit at the ending where Kenny brings Clem and AJ to Wellington only to sacrifice his spot for theirs. It was a great ending that really meshed well with the Kenny I knew from season 1, but in my own playthrough I couldn't connect with Kenny. I ultimately ended the game with Jane and the family, which felt like an incomplete ending. Seeing the father's gun and how Clem reacted to it had me interested to see if they would turn on them, but it just faded to black. Also, judging by the first trailer for season 3, I don't think it matters which ending you chose. It may be that season 1 was just too good to follow up, and if that is true I hope season 3 can overcome this. I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead. I love the show and the comics and I want to continue to see stories in this universe, but next time I also want my choices to matter more. If you're a fan of the series I recommend the game, if only to see how Clem has grown. The story is interesting enough, but the choices and payoff are lackluster.

I suggest that you finish that game prior to reading this review. That is, unless you don't care about spoilers. Consider this your fair warning.After the acclaimed success of 2012's The Walking Dead (Season One), it's no surprise that TellTale Games released a follow up less than a year later; what is a surprise is that we don't have a Season Three yet. During that short time, the company managed to add some additional mechanics that made the experience still feel as fresh as ever, despite its familiar graphics and linear styled gameplay. If your feelings and conscience were strained with the series' first installment, you haven't experienced anything yet.Continuing nearly a year after where the first game left off, The Walking Dead: Season 2 puts you in the shoes of 10 year old Clementine. Since Lee sacrificed himself to save her, Clementine eventually regrouped with Omid and a very pregnant Christa. It doesn't take long for things to heat up, and within a matter of minutes the first character is killed off, proving to the player that this title is going to be filled with even more dramatic, hard-hitting events than its predecessor. After this event, sixteen more months pass and eventually Clementine is alone in the world, left to defend herself and scavenge for food and water without the aid of anyone. It's truly a horrific plot if one thinks about it, and how dangerous a world like that would be for such a young kid, especially a little girl.Sticking with TellTale's signature design, the game is split into five episodes. As well, the player is given the choice of four dialogue options in any given conversation; jerk, nice, apathetic, and no response generally speaking. If you have a save file of Season One, the game will take the choices made from there and implement them into the storyline. While the quick time events are still present, there's also the addition of a slightly more sophisticated combat system that requires aiming with the mouse or controller. As well, the player can move Clementine around the world more in this title than Lee in the sophomore release. Basically speaking, there's more freedom of movement in this title. Other than that, the core mechanics stay the same; including the ""remember"" system where characters will remember your conversations and actions toward them.The graphic style has pretty much stagnated from the first release, although Season 2 does feature more luminosity with a few brighter colors scattered sporadically throughout; such as the sunset sky, or a campfire. It still features cell shaded comic graphics, as it should given the history of the series. It also seems to be a little more detailed, and a lot more gory than its predecessor. All are a welcomed upgrade. As usual, the voice acting is in an unrivaled top tier, and the emotions of the characters really bleed through wonderfully.If you enjoyed TellTale's first Walking Dead game, then The Walking Dead: Season 2 will not disappoint you at all. Some, like myself, may not enjoy playing as Clementine as much over Lee or another ""grown up"" character, but there's a deep appreciation for how adventuresome the storyline is. Playing a ten year old girl in a harsh environment such as the zombie apocalypse is genuinely unfathomable, and psychologically horrifying if one sits down and thinks about it deeply enough. Even though to some people it doesn't stack up as well to the first game, it's still a worthy successor and amazing story without question. Again, given its age I do recommend this title on sale.Rating:5.0/5.0- An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

Without giving anything away in terms of plot, the writers are keen to show a frank and thorough storyline and this starting episode doesn't disappoint. Much time is taken to allow the characters to show their personalities, even a subtle nuance in a character allows us to make our own choices. Its choices that rule this game - every player has his or her way of playing. Drama is at its highest as we have come to expect from this series.The only gripe I have is the revised control system, which I didn't find that responsive and there were a few keys moments where I had to go back to complete the scene because of this. Some of the language used in one of the menus I don't think translates very well to a European English audience as it didn't give a clear outcome of what would happen when was pressed, again making me replay sections of the game. For me, this is a minor detail - that being said I think the season one controls were fine and didn't need a rehash.For anyone who has played the series this is a must - and if you haven't please start with season one! Well recommended."

But I was surprised, it's pretty fantastic however I picked up the sequel much later on and whilst it does have it's high moments, it still has a great story and it's still a TellTale experience. Unfortunately all of the choices from the first game don't really matter and the choices in this game don't really seem to matter as much, it feels like whatever you choose you end up with the same end result.Same comic book style. Voice acting is good, story is good, wasn't particularly a fan of the new characters but I enjoyed the return ofKenny.The game is enjoyable overall, maybe I had high expectations for the sequel and shouldn't have done.

I think the story in this is really good and it won't stuck in one place which I was a bit afraid of in the first episode. There always something new and all the characters were interesting as well. Whether this is the final season or not doesn't really matter as the ending brings kind of closure what happens. I have only played this once and got sad ending so I hope that there will be season 3 soon.

Yes, they're zombie games and those have been done to hell and back, but never one that has been done this well. These games manage to rip and tear at every conceivable emotion available to the player.Much like many of Telltale's games these are separated into episodes and once you start an episode, it's hard to quit playing. These aren't your typical games however. They're more or less a choose your own adventure TV series. The game has a very simplistic UI and control scheme. Moving the mouse around will highlight areas of interest and you simply click once to interact with it. Action sequences are essentially quick time events and the only way to die is to fail these segments.The beauty of the game is in the storytelling and how your decisions have an impact in later episodes. Many times throughout the series I found myself making some very heated decisions based on the feelings that the game evoked and I had to live with those choices. The game does a trememdous job of making you question if you made the right decision. I've actually lied awake at night on a couple occasions really regretting what I had done.If you're not the type to care about storytelling, this isn't going to be the game for you. There's not enough substance in the core gameplay that would be appealing to someone that doesn't play games to follow a story. If that hasn't turned you away yet, the game does suffer some minor narrative issues. There are decisions you can make that really don't carry any weight, encountered more often in season 2, and ultimately the game moves along as scheduled.TL;DRIf you enjoy good narrative based games, these would be hard games to pass up. The storytelling and your ability to react to the story are outstanding."

,Recommended,261030,13150307,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,snowman slick,"Better than the first season in a lot of ways. There is a wider and more diverse cast of characters, and, although Telltale still relies heavily on the ""false"" choices where outcomes are the same regardless of your input, many of the choices feel more impactful. I was surprised several times thoughout as to how much my choice changed the outcome of several key events, and the ending to the season has an increadible amount of versatility. Most of the puzzle mechanics from the first game are gone. Where they are used, they mostly fit in well in the context of the narrative and serve as a tool to help you connect with the characters of the game.Like the first game, the story focuses strongly on themes of family, trust, and togetherness. It goes deeper than the first in investigating how people handle greif as a result of loss, and shows how the different coping mechanisms employed by different characters affect their actions and outlooks on the situation at hand. It explores how, sometimes, hard choices between the safety of the individual, group, and self must be made, and how the effects of those choices will often hurt people you never intended to hurt. There is one character who serves as the main antagonist to the second episode who shows how focusing too much on any one of these, even with initially good intentions, can lead to monstrous acts.I was a bit skeptical about the choice of pre-teen Clementine as the protagonist because it seems in the first game many of her thoughts were disregarded by the group due to her age, but it works better than I expected. There are times when that happens, but there also times when she proves herself mentally-stronger and more capable than many of the others in the group.Further, it feels like it's easier to role-play a wider variety of personalities for Clementine, as opposed to the options available for Lee in first game. I tried to play her as a moderate character whoes main goal is to keep the group together, but there are options to play something closer to a lonesome survivor, a child who focuses on her safety, or an opertunist who focuses on sticking with the most capable in her group while avoiding everyone else.At times, it felt more like I was watching a film than playing a video game. Not to say there isn't a lot of interactivity in the game. I can't recall any section where I felt things dragging on too long without me getting any input. That said, I never felt challenged in terms of either my skill at manipulating the mechanics, or in my ability to logically work through a problem. More than anything else, the most difficult challenges the game presents are all ideological. There are several scenarios where, even given that everything Clementine does goes perfectly (which it doesn't always), there is no good obvious answer as to what you should do, and the only way forward will result in someone you like getting hurt.All-in-all, a very good game. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in heavily story-driven games with a role-playing focus (that's role-playing in the sense that you make choices for a character, not in the sense that you have stats to level up)."

,Recommended,261030,11880298,"Posted: 26 August, 2014",all,Yureina,"After how good Season 1 was, Season 2 had pretty big shoes to fill that it probably never could fill in the first place. But it's not too far off either. Season 2 follows up from Season 1 (woohoo for imported saves), though sadly 400 days seems like it was a waste of time after all. I want to say there is less action this time around, but that wouldn't really be true. Rather its that the change from playing as Lee Everett to Clementine that results in less fights for the player to get involved in directly, which is kinda neat in its own way. 10 year old girls aren't expected to do as much melee stuff as a 37 year old man would, though you still do some of that here.There's also less adventure game style puzzles to do... alot less. Most of the gameplay here is dialogue choices and relatively brief action sequences, which almost puts this game into visual novel territory. It's a shame because there are far fewer opportunities for wandering around just chatting or interacting with the environment, which weakens the character development a bit for the new faces that don't get much time. It means that Season 2's episodes are generally shorter, but it also means that you spend less time wandering about and more time following the plot. A plot that is still quite good, though perhaps not as likely to bring people to tears as some of the bigger moments of Season 1 did. Nothing in Season 2 got that to happen for me, though the finale came close as you find yourself making rough choices that can give you very different endings (unlike Season 1, which ended the same way no matter what).I'd say the high points of the season are found in Episodes 2 and 5 (which are also the longest episodes), with the other episodes mainly serving as build-up towards those bigger moments. I'm not sure where this series will go from here, but it seems very likely that we will see a Season 3. Whether that is with who ultimately makes it out of Season 2 or not (which has to consolidate the varied endings for this season), or if it is an entirely new cast, is uncertain. Until we find out... enjoy this one. It's pretty good. :)"
,Recommended,261030,11884446,"Posted: 27 August, 2014",all,[TPZ] Cereal Killer,"About The Game:The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a story driven adventure based on the highly popular comic books & television series of the same name developed by Robert Kirkman.The game starts off right from the end of the first season where Clementine has met up with Kirsta and Omid after the events of the original game.From the very beginning you're brought right back into the great story telling & suspensful gameplay that you've come to expect from Telltale Studios, all is the same except for that it's now around about 3 years later and Clementine is no longer the child from the first game.The Story:This time around the story focuses on Clementine and her experiences in the world of ""The Walking Dead"", it's a long journey that is anticipated right from the beginning to the end & a worthy experience for all gamers who appreciate a good story.The Story for ""The Walking Dead"" is a very long one and has so many different outcomes that it is really hard to write down, the best i can really say is that it's quite the rollercoaster ride & i really urge you to just give it a go. Check out Youtube playthroughs to determine whether or not this is a game for you.The Gameplay:The Gameplay for The Walking Dead is the same as all Telltale games, it's designed really to be an interactive story more than a game, you push buttons that prompt your character to use different dialogues which determine many different things in which the character react to you, think about you & what they'll do for you & solve puzzles in order to progress further in the story.It's an interactive movie really you watch the game unfold while giving it mild plot changes during gameplay with the occasional Quick Time event that determines whether you die or not.The Verdict:The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a game that is not for everyone but it's certainly an experience for people who love a solid story or if you're a fan of The Walking Dead comics or TV series, or even if you're just a Zombie fan.While this game has a very solid story & it's great to go through and try different things on other playthoughs it really just shines brilliance when you take the time to get to know each character and determine which characters you would want on your side in a real apocolypse scenario.While the gameplay is pretty much just Quick Time Events it's 1 of those games where it works because it's not designed to really make you work, unlike a Third Person or First Person game you are playing a game in this you're watching & creating a story.This game also receives a 10/10 along with the first game because they're just so damn good. It is everything i expected for this series and nothing let me down.It would have been nice to feel like some of my decisions really made a difference but it doesn't really matter all that much because the game is set on a very straight story that can't really be branched because of it's close steps towards the comic book narritive.Do I Recommend This Game?:Yes i do recommend it and it's well worth a play as i said throughout my whole review.If You Haven't Played Season 1:http://store.steampowered.com/app/207610/Other Games Similar You Might Like:The Wolf Among Us:http://store.steampowered.com/app/250320/Jurrasic Park:http://store.steampowered.com/app/201830/Or you can just check out the whole catalogue of Telltale games as they're all very similar:http://store.steampowered.com/publisher/Telltale%20GamesCheck Out My Review For Season 1:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/207610/"

Choices you make during S2 are not determinant until the last minutes of EP5, and that's a shame because this gives you too little REAL decisional power, but it was nice to have a so hectic and variable ending. Now I'm curious to see what will happen in Season 3 and if the main character will change again.There are also some plot holes here and there, things happen without explanations, some questions are left there without a real answer. I also found some new charaters to be really interesting and well built, others instead barely newsworthy. And well, sometimes Clementine is appointed with decisions and tasks too heavy for a small girl like her, not realistic and a bit forced by script and gameplay reasons, but fun nonetheless!I liked Season 2, I recommend it to everyone who loved Season 1, however you need to know and like Telltale narrative and graphical style, so if you never played TWD or The Wolf Among Us, start from there before buying this one."

I have to think about Half-Life, Mass Effect, Spec Ops, recently Dear Esther, Far Cry... All those games, they moved me with the story and the worlds in which they were designed.This game does the same, perhaps even better, or at least very, very effective to the point of reminding me the good times I had with those. It's also the reason why I rank them amongst those tops, because it definitly deserves being there for the amazing storytelling, the level design, the choices (although there were less than in Season 1, they were still decisive) and the consistency. Not to mention the price for so many houres and the constant evolvement. You're basically paying for what most companies would have let you pay 5 times instead (one for each new chapter of the story, you know what companies I'm talking about right?).I recommend this game, at all costs. You may not like the series, but you will as a gamer definitly like this one.

As it stands though it still does a great job.There's a slightly updated UI in place now.  It's more sleek and polished.  Quicktime events also make better use of the thumbstick now.

Its strongpoint is its dynamic storytelling and character development, which are tailored to player choice, not unlike role-playing games. This game creates characters better than most others, they feel more alive than any other game due to how responsive they are to your dialogue choices. Combined with the intensity of the plot, The Walking Dead is one of the easiest games to connect to, rivaled only by some of Bioware's RPGs. It's a definite must-have for any gamer, no matter how experienced you are.

Think of it as a mix between a Heavy Rain, Sam and Max, and of course, The Walking Dead. In this game your choices actually matter, they have an impact on what the rest of your game will be like, which is not something you see everyday. The cell shaded art style gives it a unique comic book feel, wish makes it stick to it's roots from The Walking Dead comic, which is nice, sometimes it can draw you away from the experience but overall it doesn't matter. Asides a few technical bugs, like characters disappearing and re-appearing, there is nothing that extremely catches your attention. The characters though, damn, playing as Clementine and choosing sides (or being neutral) between different characters throughout the game builds more of a relationship, and brings you more in-depth with how people are affected by the apocalypse. This is great so far, you'll see when you play it for yourself. which you sure as hell should do."

It's not very good at all.The problem I have with a lot of zombie fiction is how self-serious and forcibly edgy it can get. The Walking Dead show and comic suffer terribly from this at time, but the first season of the game managed to mostly avoid that. There was hope, there was humanity, but there was still that dark, ugly side that we all love the genre for. People died suddenly and terribly. It was sad. The characters were imperfect and divisive, but they felt human. Which made it all the harder to see them go.But this time around, it just seems like much of the cast is only there to die. They get a single personality trait, and then development gets tossed aside in favour of counting down the minutes until another one of them is torn apart or whatever. I'm sitting here trying to remember anything about some of them aside from how they died.There were plenty of shocking moments, but they came so often and without any weight to them that it hit that terrible, damning point overly bleak stuff like this can reach: I stopped caring. I was no longer worried about the cast (aside from Clem herself) and didn't care who lived or died anymore. There was no one to root for but her, and the plot seemed to be going absolutely nowhere aside from the group walking forward.One major character seemed to be written to be intentionally divisive. You'll know who I mean once you meet them. But the way it's done feels clumsy and irritating. Which is a problem when a huge amount of the drama unfolding centres around this one person. I was just exhausted listening to them speak by the end.That said, the season does have a really strong opening episode. It's harrowing and brutal and tense all throughout. Just like the rest of the season should have been. But after that, it becomes a parade of meaningless death without any real purpose. The first season had a goal, even if it wasn't a very good one, had a main character with a purpose, and it had a proper arc to the overall plot. But this one is just meandering for four episodes before they decide that's all, folks.Also disappointing: most of the cast introduced in the 400 days add-on for the first season is absent or irrelevant. That DLC had a lot of cool mini-stories that I would have liked to see developed more. One character does return full-time, but the rest are forgotten.I'm still a big fan of what Telltale is doing in their other stuff, and I don't have any technical or gameplay complaints to bring up. But I have to say they totally lost me here. It just felt like they didn't know where to go with things and the edge was just too strong to take this season seriously or invest myself emotionally. Which is probably good, because I don't think I could take being as devastated as last time all over again."

Not in a bad way though, the relationship you have with clem whilst you play as lee is trully amazing and one of the best in gaming which is why to top the first season would have taken a miracle. This season does however do a really great job of making you feel helpless in a very bleak and dark world, which is good since you play as a little girl. The episodes are all done well and are constantly great throughout, and the 5th episode is brilliant in every way and rivals that of the first seasons. The way the game ends as well makes season 3 look like it will really be different and alot more personnel for everyone which is fantastic, becuase i would love my choices to make a much greater impact on the story in both seasons. Unfortunately things can be a bit stupid sometimes e.g. everyone relying on a little girl to do everything, at one point you as clem are forced to kick open a door whilst a women just stands next to you. Also one or two choices are poorly done and the outcome kinda feels cheap, although this really is only one or two choices. In basic though if you loved the first season then you will surely love this and now that all the episodes are out you wont have to wait whilst telltale screw around with the realease dates."

Although sometimes it can surprise you what conversational choice says what.A quick mention for the gameplay, Season 1 veterans will instantly recognise the difference in how the game plays out, While Lee wasn't as big as other characters in the games, he was most certainly a powerhouse, often pulling together amazing feats of strength for a Teacher. Clementine plays differently however, she's small, light and nimble, dodging takes center stage in Season 2 as Clem's main winning move.New characters will be introduced and just like Clem, they don't trust anyone any more. (STILL... NOT... BIT!)These new characters are likeable and some new favourites of mine popped up in Season 2.The production value of Season 2 also feels higher, Season 1 feels very much like a low cost game, and often feels more bland in it's low points than Season 2. However my favourite moments, still come from Season 1 (one of them is named above in the spoiler section)Season 2's finale doesn't feel as high impact as Season 1's which makes me hope that Season 3 is quickly on the way to pick up the excitement.Season 2 is an excellent step in the Walking Dead series, I recommend both Season 1 and 2 to any one that has not yet purchased them.8.5/10"

,Recommended,261030,11908940,"Posted: 29 August, 2014",all,tafkag,"SPOILERSShort Version: An exceedingly good game let down by a couple of tiny gripes for me. The characters aren't as accessible, and the story moves too fast, taking the grim, tense slog out of the post-apocalyptic world.The Walking Dead Game: Season Two was a game I awaiting with my teeth buried into my knuckles in anticipation, staring at the calendar for each episode of the five-part season. Prior to playing I had some serious fears for the game, not least that it was following The Walking Dead Game: Season One, which was most probably my favourite game of 2012, so well done Telltale for that. Suffice it to say therefore that Season Two had some huge booties to fill. For me there are two things that prevent Season Two from achieving this. One is something that I can explain myself to an extent, but it nevertheless does bite at my immersion-loving ankles, the other is perhaps the most surprising qualm I've ever had with a game. Enough build up.Problem one. One of my favourite aspects of Season One was having a wealth of moments where your entire group was sat milling around by a broken-down train, or hiding out in a drug store. As Lee you could seize these moments of tranquillity and have a chat with all of your companions. Not only was there ample supply of these moments, but the conversations themselves were full of options so you could get to know your fellow man/woman/child/Ben. Having long, character defining conversations, where each character could say something to entirely change how you see them, for better or worse was one of the most engrossing things about Season One for me. It made each moment with them matter. They could reveal themselves to be a closet racist, or a snobbish elitist at heart, or they could show a depth of empathy and caring you'd not expected from them and never would have.However, in Season Two, these conversation moments are whittled down, instead with a heavier focus on story (more on that later). While this could not necessarily be a bad thing (more story, more value for money etc) it means that I never felt much for any of the characters. While every death in Season One struck me in some way, characters came and went in Season Two like cars on a motorway. At some points I barely had time to remember their names and 'poof', they were dead or split off or otherwise departed. This meant that even as far as Episode Five people could die and my reaction was the same as if I'd just watched them scratch their chin. Given that by the timescale of Season Two, the zombie apocalypse has been cracking on for a good year and then some, so perhaps this less talkative batch of people works; everyone's realised that getting to know people well isn't a worthwhile investment. But it still makes the game feel shallow to me (by comparison with Season One, it's still gloriously rich compared with most, don't get me wrong).That's problem that I can explain myself. Problem two though is a baffler. Due to the lack of slow, conversational moments to regulate the pace of the story, Season Two barrels through what I could have happily seen spread over Season Two and Three really. Yup, too much plot! So much happens in such a short space of play-time that, even though your character has gone through more ordeals than you can shake a dismembered limb at, I still felt cheated at the end. I finished the finale (which is a gloriously heart-breaking set of decisions that caused me a have a very restless night's sleep, so applause for you again Telltale, I'd ruffle your hair were you here), and looking back over the game, felt like I'd played the Cliff Notes version of the story, rather than the full text. There was so much potential for character development and building some horrific tension and decision-making into Carver's community. I'd happily have stayed there and let characters evolve and come to terms/blows with the situation a lot more. But the story seemed to feel the need to charge headlong onwards. Exploring Carver's world could have been fantastic, but it's gone now. Shame.My main gripe story wise was that it became suddenly very linear. I saw an opportunity with Carver in Episode Three. My Clementine was by that point a cold, logical, unshakable zombie/bandit annihilation machine, and I saw the opportunity to stick with Carver. You want to survive, you join the winning side. To hell with the broken people you started out with. Life is for those who can keep it. But I was funnelled into making a decision I didn't particularly want to make, and this probably soured much of Episode Four for me.However those are just two small(ish) issues that, because I'm a whiny git, I'm blowing out of proportion. The Walking Dead Game: Season Two is a fantastically made game, which slicker graphics, faster paced action and drama, and the same tough decisions, which ACTUALLY HAVE AN EFFECT on the outcome this time. I'm perhaps overly critical on what I'd consider issues that spoilt what would have definitely been my favourite game of 2014. If it had stayed a little truer to Season One, with a batch of characters I could get to know, it would have been a marvel of just how phenomenal a game could be. Instead, it's just very, very good. Given what it could have been, being an 8/9 out of 10 game is somehow a disappointment."

Not that there was anything wrong with Lee, but playing as an eleven-year-old girl is so much more interesting.  Clem is inherently and automatically so powerless in some situations, and yet incredibly powerful in ways you wouldn't expect.

The game includes difficult choices that ultimately lead to dangerous consequences. However you play it, there will always be hard decisions that require a lot of attention.This incredible Telltale game carries on from the previous storyline of Season 1.I would definitely recommend the game to anyone who has played Season 1 and wants to give it a try,(however if you are thinking of getting Season 2 first, I wouldn't because the gameplay of Season 1 will ultimately affect this gameplay,) personally I bought it during a sale, when it was reduced to £4.99, and I feel as if this game should be worth £15.00 on steam instead of full price of £18.99, but that's just my opinion.There are 5 acts in this great game, however Act 1 and 2 didn't really impress me, the gameplay seemed slow and the decisions that needed to be made were relatively simple, and didn't come at a huge cost. However Acts 3, 4 and 5 were much better, with a better more adaptable storyline with more action and more difficult decisions.Personally I played this game quite passively and tried to stay out of combat too much, whilst trying to make friends with everyone and not get in their way, however I couldn't do this for the whole game as some decisions required me to choose 1 side.The improved gameplay from the first Season also made it stand out more and the Main Menu and UI was improved from the previous season.I finished the game within a week of buying it, and although it may be a short playtime, it makes up for in gameplay.Looking forward to Season 3 and hopefully it will be as good as the previous 2!!!Overall I give this game a 9.1/10!!!!The only fault of this game would be watching the credits after every Act, as it gets a bit repetitive!SPOILER ALERT:Lee will be met again sometime in this playthrough!!!"

The interface is largely the same, with a little bit of modernization in terms of look and feel of the UI, and a stronger sense they are eschewing some of the more traditional puzzler mechanics in favor of storytelling.And that they do well. In the conclusion I found myself unconciously making choices not on what I thought my desired ""win state"" was, but instead what was the right way forThe Walking Dead, and in so doing found a very satisifying emotional experience; one that made me think of what would happen to the characters as a result.

Walking Dead so far does a good job of continuing from season 1 and still makes me feel like it's a different game by putting me in the shoes of Clementine instead of the Lee. The Story line doesn't have a linear path which I feel fits the chaotic zombie apocolypse feel.

This season focuses on Clementine and how much she has grown up since the events of season one. She has witnessed some truly horrific events and it has changed her as a person. She is no longer the sweet little girl from the first season. She is willing to do whatever it takes to keep her and her loved ones alive. You meet a lot of new characters that you aren't sure if you will care about them or not. But as you get farther in, you get to know the characters better and you either fall in love with them or hate them. You still choose how the story plays off and some decisions will affect you in later on episodes. There were some very crucial decisions that I don't know if I could even make if I were in Clementine's shoes. Once again the writing and acting is top notch and never failed to entertain me. I was at tears at the end of the last episode and thought the ending had as much as a powerful impact as the first season did. There was a even a moment that made me cringe and it made it even better because it showed how hard it is to do things on your own. One thing I would take off for this season would be that I felt that some of the characters were wasted. I felt that they had more potential/development but suddenly they were just dead. Also, for most things when you make a decision, you basically get the same result if you were to make a different choice. But overall, The Walking Dead Season Two was an awesome experience and I will play it again sometime soon. If you still haven't bought this game, what are you waiting for? Stop reading this really long review and buy it!8.6/10+ Clementine's Story is amazing.+ Crucial decisions leave you thinking.+ Writing and acting is excellent.+ Has a very high emotional impact.+ Masterful last episode.- Some characters were wasted.- Diverse choices lead to same results."

It's a playable story with limited decisions that you play for the story and good voice acting. So what's up with TWD Season 2? It's good. Not quite as good as Season 1, TWD2 is still a worthy title.I don't think you can call this game ""fun"". After all, the choices are depressing. Your ability to actually change things is exceptionally limited. It's more of an interactive story than a game. Still, I find this series compelling to play and the narrative gripping. Clem is one of my most favorite characters in all my gaming years (stretching back to Pong). The voice acting continues to be a major strength of the series.I found Season 2's quality more variable than Season 1. There were far more gut-punches in #1, far more difficult decisions in #1 than in this season. Still, this has it's moments. But frankly perhaps the biggest flaw is that there are too many characters that you don't really get to know them. They seem - and often are - expendible whereas in Season #1 the group was tighter and better fleshed out.If you haven't played Season 1, get that first. But these titles are really worth your time because they tell such great stories."

Clem works well as a protagonist and will like to help shape her as she is growing older. However, the dynamic narrative that worked so well between Lee and Clem in the first season is lacking and never made up for.The basic problem of the season is the lack of purpose. You don't have a major goal really at any time, you don't feel like there's a natural flow and so all the little events, personal drama, human loss and so on end up feeling meaningless. The other characters are either unbelievable (so stupid?) or just never fully developed before they disappear and this is in big contrast to Season 1.So as I said, It's definitely worth playing but not nearly as good as the first (7/10)."

,Recommended,261030,12196230,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,Sibylus,"Playing The Walking Dead's second season was an interesting experience. Naturally it can't be done without engendering constant comparisons to the first season- a game that earned much praise. It's a game whose strengths and weaknesses mostly differ from Season 1's. It makes a 1:1 comparison a bit touchy, but it's nonetheless a fun exercise and my chosen approach for this review.The most similar element is the most readily visible: both games share the same ink-and-colour aesthetic that evokes some of the look of the original, long-running comic series. In what may be indicative of a larger Telltale war-chest to draw upon, the gore has definitely been stepped up to another level in terms of detail and willingness to revel in it. A few scenes in particular will definitely disturb if you're squeamish.As gameplay goes there's a lot of contrast. Expect fewer ""hub"" areas to explore and fewer interactable items and puzzles populating them. Episodes will tend to run somewhat shorter as a result. This is a difference that will probably slim down to near-zero on replays, however. Dialogue trees in general seem to compose more of the final product than in Season 1. The more traditional ""search and explore"" gameplay elements take a hit to accommodate this.The writing team has some familiar faces from S1, but there was definite flux as several members moved on partway through production (to Campo Santo's debut title,Firewatch). Episodes 1, 2, and 5 receive the most attention from this small group of developers, and coincidentally or not these are the better parts of the season for me. Another difference evident from the writing department is that villain characters are fleshed out much more satisfyingly throughout the season. The buildup to S1's Stranger, though fantastic, stumbled by the end somewhat and didn't sufficiently honour the player's approach to past choices. In contrast S2 combines villain characters who are far more memorable than the Stranger when on screen, but unlike S1 ultimately didn't receive as much buildup and were underutilized in terms of the final act. These factors may (at least in my mind) account for some of the meandering and unsteady footing the story found itself burdened with as it scrambled toward its finale.Once it reaches it, the finale for the most part is fantastic. In a key departure from the design approach of the first season, Telltale this time around blew the wheels off in terms of distinguishing ending choices from one another. You can expect a healthy dose of meaningful variation that will say a lot about the sort of Walking Dead player you are: what you can live with and what you can't. Solid finish to a great game.If you're like me you'll walk away still feeling that Season 1 was a stronger outing by a touch, but will nonetheless feel glad you played the game. How Season 3 resolves its numerous divergent story threads, and how it lives up to Seasons 1 and 2 will be interesting to see."

The major issue I had with the orignal Walking Dead game is that a LOT of the choices for me felt very one sided, you could say a little black and white.Season Two manages to really give you tough choices this time round, everything really does feel 50/50, characters aren't as really deemed ""good"" or ""bad"" the things they do in the world can really be taken differently depending on the person playing. I found myself a lot of the times really thinking ""Should I really do this?"" or ""Is X maybe right?"" and even after making the choice feeling that self doubt, wondering if I'd made the right choice.Overall, they've improved on the idea of what you do effects the story so much over each game, and it really does add to some replayability, since some decisions might mean certain events might not happen, or some people might not survive, it makes you want to know all the possible outcomes.The story telling is just so well done in this series. Telltale just do such a good job sticking to the tone and feel of a universe while still being able to add their own touch to give it that unique flavour.The Walking Dead comics have always been very character driven and about conflicting veiw points about how an average person can live in such a hellish world.Telltale stick to that formula perfectly, making very real and believable characters, some likeable and others... Not so likeable, but overall adding to the drama of the story, not one character (to me at least) felt super out of place, everything has a reason for being there and it all adds up for some interesting situations.The team at Telltale really do need to be praised for all the work they've done. You can see a lot of thought and effort has really gone into making this game be as immersive as it can be. Oh and the voice acting is just as smooth as ever, so a big gold star for the actors, too.Now for the things that irked me in some places, which surprisingly isn't an awful lot; if anything they really are just nit-picks i'd like to see improved on in future games.The puzzle solving elements really were lacking compaired to the original game. In Season One, there was a LOT of times where you had to figure out how to get out of sticky situation, ultimately deciding whether you walked away in one piece, or became a tasty Walker snack.In Season 2 it tends to just either tell you what to do or give you the bare minimum of things to interact with in order to progress the story.I'm not asking for Sam and Max style ""I'll combine two random things and place it on something I never would have thought to"" style of puzzles. Just something to cut up the drama and make me think for a bit, whether it be to reflect on my latest actions or to simply enjoy absorbing the environment.My last thing to really bug me is animation. Now I don't mean it looks bad, actually the oppiset, the art style is amazing, it sticks to the comic book really well. What more gets to me is sometimes how characters move or react, it can sometimes feel very stiff and robotic at times or even a little goofy the way certain characters are placed or the way they stand, It just seems a little unnatural to me.I would really love to see some more fluid movements in future games, possibly even a little motion capture thrown in.Hell, If I have to pay a little extra for an even better experiance, I can live with not eating for a bit.Final thoughts are really this is a unique game, it probably won't be to everyones tastes but for me it sits just right. I love interactive stories, and having the world change to my decisions makes it that something more special.If you like good character driven stories filled with conflct and tears, well written and brilliantly acted, you should probably play this.tl;drIs good game. You like interactive story, go buy this, maybe play original first though."

Now, lets go deep into the subject. In TWD season 1 you play as Lee, but what you don't realize is that you ARE Lee, Lee's choices are your choices. They reveal what kind of moral status you have, what kind of person you are. Your stablished duty is to raise and protect Clementine, but this isn't the main objective of the game; its the way how you are going to do this. At the end, after having met a lot of people, having friendships, having enemies, chosing the fate of some people, you will notice which kind of human being are you, and if you played as the moral guys we all are, you will be proud and happy for Lee, yourself, or dissapointed, to then change you view lifeNow, TWD season 2. Gosh, this will make you feel stuff. You are now Clementine, no objective more than surviving. This is where you get to know you as a human. Lying to survive or telling the truth?, robbing or giving?, helping the weak or to guard for the group and your future?

The new characters are not as likable as the Season 1 cast but this will make you have a harder time to decide who dies and who doesn't which makes more sense but this makes you think why do I care if Sarita dies for instance which is a little annoying but also better for the player when they have to make a tough decision. I have to say the episodes of best to worst go in this order.Episode 3: In Harms WayEpisode 5: No Going BackEpisode 2: A House DividedEpisode 1: All That RemainsEpisode 4: Amid The Ruinsbtw this is my personal opinion.GameplayThe Gameplay is again a point and click adventure game but replacing the puzzles that took a long chunk out of the episodes with QTEs (Quick Time Events) which are done rather well they are definitely better than Season 1s.GraphicsThe Graphics are slightly better than Season 1 and have had a slightly more realistic look to the environment instead of the comic book style from the first season of The Walking Dead.Final VerdictI think that on a technical basis this is better than its predecesor but from a perspective of the story I think the first season has more shockers than this one.The Walking Dead: Season 28/10btw can't wait for Season 3 of this amazing game series."

On the other side I also thought about how it might be better for Kenny if I'd simply end his life so that 'he could be with his family again'. I think Kenny is the best choice because the children are his life, everything he has left to fight for, and he'd do anything to protect them, even though I may not always agree. If Season 3 comes out I'll make sure to play through it with all of the endings because I'm curious how each of them affect the story but my favourite will still be the Wellington one.Going out alone is the hardest one. I dont like what Jane did but I think it's terrible to take away everything Kenny fought for and leave him after a chance of making an end to it.

From there, the game tells a strong and compelling tale, with plenty of memorable moments.The one bugbear (aside from some wonky and in one case buggy controls) is the thin veneer of choice. I was so bothered by the death of one character that I planned to restart the episode - until I learned that the character would die later in the episode anyway. There are few consequences for decisions, and even the big consequences (like saving a character) are undermined by the game finding a way to kill them soon after. The first season at least had the culmination of your choices on display in the final episode through the people who chose to join you - the second doesn't even have that, and instead essentially offers a multiple-choice ending.Hopefully the third season will take the choice/consequence system much further."

This story, these characters, everything draws you in and immerses you into a dangerous world where you truly feel that all hope is lost. Some parts will make you laugh, or simply crack a smile, while others will send tears running down your eyes as you witness the death of yet another beloved character...yet another comrade taken by things far worst then zombies. If your a fan of season one then you should need no convincing! Season two is just as good or I dare say even better then the first, and this is coming from someone who is only on episode 2 of the second season, and already its been an emotional roller coaster. If your a fan of the show then I will just be blunt with you, in my honest opinion, this game is 10x better then the show is or most likely ever will be. It might just be a game, but the characters are just so much more interesting, you feel drawn to them and when one of them is forever silenced not only do you feel sadness, but a burning anger as well.Your choices mold the story, you decided who to befriend and at times who lives and who dies. The decisions are hard, the consequences even harder, but in the end it all comes down to survival of the fittest, and as you steer young Clementine through this dangerous world and watch her grow into a young women you'll start to look back on your past decisions with regret. The fact that once you make the choices their set in stone is what makes the game so fun, just like in realy life once you make a choice there is no going back.EDIT: After finally completing the game I must say that the ending was very satisfying indeed, you actually get to decide how it ends unlike the first one where what happens at the end of the game is set in stone. As a man, I'm not afraid to admit that tears were shed towards the end of this game, and the fact that a videogame can make me shed tears at all makes this one of the best games out there in my book."

Clem is still no more than ten years old, and the way that potentially changes how the player will interact with the world in this season is exciting. For her age, Clementine is certainly quite clever and strong, but the world of The Walking Dead is full of monsters, zombie and otherwise, and there's no question she's more vulnerable and less powerful than Lee was. One of the challenges of this is balancing between giving the player agency in the world without giving Clem influence she shouldn't have from a narrative point of view. This is going to have to be a very different story, and with the setup, it's somewhat hard to see how it will pay off the way the first season did, but we'll have to wait and find out.In terms of gameplay, very little has changed from the first season. Most of the important interaction comes from dialogue choices, with QTEs and a few simple fetch quests tossed in to break things up. Like in the original, you will sometimes have to make some tough choices, and the game will keep track of how you choose, leading to slightly different situations. I sometimes miss the more difficult puzzles found in Telltale's earlier titles such as Tales of Monkey Island, but their more recent games seem to be going for a different type of genre, so it's probably best not to make direct comparisons. This is less an adventure game and more of a visual novel, albeit one that does a very good job of keeping the player within the lines while simultaneously making them feel like the story is their own. Perhaps things will change up in later episodes, but I don't really think they have to if the main concept is pulled off properly.screen1136x1136-9From a technical standpoint, well, this is an iOS version of a Telltale game, so things aren't going to be completely airtight. In particular, I should give a clear warning to people on older hardware. If your hardware was not officially supported but could run the first season in some fashion anyway, don't count on the same here. Things went pretty smoothly on my iPhone 5S, but I've seen tons of complaints from people on circa-iPhone 4 tech. Given Telltale's history, don't count on much technical support after the fact, either. One thing that did work quite well is the save game import. As long as you kept the first season on your device, you'll be able to import your final data for that. There aren't many ramifications in the first episode apart from the ""Previously"" opening, but I'm sure things will come into play in less subtle ways eventually.From here, I'll write up a bit about each episode as they're released. As with the main review, I'll do my best to avoid spoiling anything current when talking about each one, but there may be spoilers for prior episodes as we go along. Tread at your own risk!"

The story is a fantastic follow up of where the first game left off, and develops Clementine's character as she grows up in this apocalyptic world.Unlike the first game, you do end up making a choice that defines the ending of the game. However if you've played the third installment, you'll know how pointless that choice really is. Personally I don't really care about the choices, but I know alot of people do.

But this game is mostly unrelated, so don't let that hold you back.The graphics are not going to impress you, that's it.  But that's okay too.  TellTale uses a shell shading style that masks the low-end graphics.  But graphics aren't the focus here, story and characters are.The characters are well developed in this series, perhaps more so than the first.  The story is more exciting.  The game play has shifted to being more story based and less “lets look around for some batteries.”The largest complaint that I had with the first season was that the game purports to be all about the choices you make and how it affects the world.  However, at the end of season one the ending was always the same, or at least nearly the same.  Yes, some characters may have died and others lived, but in the end you ended up in the same situation.  Season two drastically changes that.  In fact, there are several different endings.  I don't even know how telltale plans to stitch this together into a cohesive season 3 without making 5 different games!Considering that this game isn't very expensive even at full retail, and it really is one of the best games you can buy, you would be crazy not too.

76561198018740637,Recommended,261030,14150322,"Posted: 24 January, 2015",all,Athena_Colt,"This game is a unique offering that has combined originality with the old-fashioned art of good story-telling, mirroring the formula that made Season One so effective. The game is not without its faults, which are often easy to look past as we are so engrossed with the main narrative arc, however the overall gaming experience is fresh and enjoyable.The main narrative is driven at a perfect pace, compelling us forward when needed and pulling back teasingly when we wish to discover more about the characters that inhabit the game world. There aren’t as many intricate back stories, or developed background characters compared with Season One, however there’s just enough depth to peak our interests. As the gamer progresses through the five episodes, there is a conflict between a devastating reality and a desire to keep together the integrity of a world we once knew, embodied in the preservation of a young girl’s innocence. As we make real-time choices in the game, they reveal our natural urge for self-preservation, evoking many difficult emotions that few other games have managed to match in the past.Much like RPG’s that encourage ‘choice’, there is an element here of ‘are my dialogue choices really making a difference, or is it just one or two choice options in reality?’ Although I’m sure that there are only a couple of ‘choices’ that drastically affect the narrative in the entire season, you do genuinely feel like you are driving the characters’ responses and play an active part in the story. There isn’t an element of charade over your dialogue which there has been, at times, in games such as Mass Effect, which makes us feel like the outcome is preprogramed no matter what. This is a real achievement in making us feel we are making a real difference, which is essential in a narrative-driven video game. Choice or no choice, we feel an emotional tie to Clementine and try to rationalise every decision, with her fate in mind.The decision to continue with cell-shaded graphics is also a well-informed one. It manages to maintain some authenticity to the original Kirkman comics while also adding to the surrealistic nature of the Walker apocalypse. I would also suggest that, being a game that focuses purely on narrative over gameplay, it is fine for the graphics to be limited in this way, as the suburban streets and snowy hills don’t need to be rendered in graphical realism in order to drive the storyline. In many ways, high-end graphics would have only served to distract the gamer from the humanistic choices they must make throughout the game therefore the cell-shaded approach focuses the narrative even more.If we look at the gameplay, there really is not much here to talk about that’s new in Season Two. Stripped to its core, it’s largely a mix of old-school real-time event button mashing and a little bit of ‘find the blue key’ to progress. The gamer enters rooms or new environment, picks up what they need to develop the story, engages with the characters, and moves onto the next narrative section. In this form, it sounds terribly archaic and limited, and maybe it is, but I rarely felt that the gameplay tasks were tedious. When we enter a new room for example, the gamer wants to check every nook for items that might possibly aid their cause for survival. In the back of our mind we know that this is probably a pointless task, but the atmosphere of the game is set so that we genuinely feel the need to check and recheck shelves and cupboards that might hold water or batteries, just in case they help us a little further down the line.However, I do think the limited gameplay affects the replay value of this title. Once we have completed our journey and we know many of the plot twists, the gameplay does become tiresome the second time round as we are no longer as driven to discover the next part of the plot. Granted, we could play through again to choose all the options we didn’t choose in the first play through, but this feels unauthentic as many of the choices we make are in ‘real-time’. If we play through knowing what these real-time event options are and predetermine our choices, the whole enjoyability and possibly the playability of the game goes out of the window.A quick mention of the ‘serial’ format of the game, the idea of releasing a new episode every few months. Does this work for The Walking Dead Season One & Two? Yes. Would I like to see more games adopt this approach? No. The reason being is that playing an episode, waiting 60 days and playing another episode does disjoint the experience. It’s not like the TV series which is released weekly or bi-weekly, but months after, and this does affect our thrill of playing a game week to week. *a note on the TV series, I actually felt that these five episodes and the first season too, compliment the show perfectly in its tone and in many ways the stories here surpass the TV show, which is on occasion, laborious to view, this game does not suffer the same fate*.Although this game is a one trick pony in the sense that we are almost just playing for the narrative, I think this can totally be overlooked if the narrative is this enjoyable. The unexpected real-time events keep you on your toes and keep the adrenaline flowing without ever feeling tedious. It’s far from faultless, but overall this is a fresh gaming experience that will more than likely spawn many copy cats. It’s not as satisfying as the first season, but TellTale have another provocative winner.Many thanks for reading, comments and feedback is welcomed as always."

You think choices don't matter so much? This season's ending changes that all!!Short Summary of Season 2:Clementine makes it to Omid and Christa and they continue surviving together. Clementine encounters another girl in the bathroom and the girl shoots Omid by mistake. A while after we see Christa and Clem around a campfire. We can see that Christa's baby didn't make it. Christa is attacked by a group of survivors and she and Clem split up. Another group finds Clementine and she continues with this group. A lot of other things happen and we see Kenny back, but to know the rest you just have to play!Opinion:This wasreally really amazing. The voice acting is very good and the graphics are more improved than season 1. The soundtrack in every ending of an episode is really nice and the choices you've made are showed in the ending like season 1. I wish here was the short summary in the end of season 2, which shows your relationship with the characters just like season 1. The writing of this season was just as good as the first season and the ending was just a big WOW. I mean I bet everyone didn't even know what to do at that point, kill Kenny who is your old friend but he was losing it or kill Jane who is very experienced but made a very wrong action to show what Kenny has come to? I personally choose to kill Kenny. The reason for this is because he was really losing it and he didn't go well with other group members, after all he wanted to be with Katjaa, Duck and Sarita.Short list of Pros and Cons:Pros:- Great Graphicshttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=468377446- Even better story- Choices get betterhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=469787396- Great soundtrackCons:- ??Overall Season 2 just amazing, well-written, great graphics and great sound. I recommend it mostly to those who liked Season 1 and like the tv show. If you haven’t played Season 1, you should do that first. I’d rate this 10/10! Played the game? Post down your choices for Episode 5!"

I'm going to say, this is still my second favorite choice based game I have ever played. I did like Life is Strange much better, but who doesn't like rejecting teenage boys? Jokes aside. This game was not spoiled for me like the first game; maybe I would have liked the first one better. I kept my word, and never trusted anyone. This was my goal for the game, don't trust hope and trust no one. The game has 4-5 endings, much better than only two like the first game had. I loved my ending, since I didn't follow hope, it was exactly what I wanted for an ending.The beauty of the game is, you're a cute little girl, and no man is ever going to punch you. You can be a ""c***"" to anyone you wish and watch them contemplate hitting you.In other words, if you like the first game, buy it. If you haven't played it, buy the first game.

,Recommended,261030,8173948,"Posted: 21 December, 2013",all,OpCode90,"Having been personally inspired by Clementine's personality traits while we were finaling the script for Contrast, I was very eager to play the first episode of Season 2. I'm happy to say that this first episode largely delivered on my expectations for the new season, and I'll be looking forward to see how the script evolves over the season.The context - that of following and playing Clementine after her escape from the city - provides for a brilliant premise, and Telltale's scriptwriting is at its best when it captures the poignant mixture of her courage and vulnerability. For that alone, The Walking Dead is worth purchasing.Melissa Hutchison's performance is strong and well directed, but I am ambivalent about Telltale's decision to reuse the adult actress to voice the main character. On the one side, her delivery provides a certain eerie maturity to a child that has been forced to mature too quickly, but on the other side, it lacks the spontaneous magic that comes from recording an actual child actor.The choices are interesting; they feel similar in nature to the ones in Season 1, but I wish I was being forced into taking harder and more difficult decisions. Playing through the episode once doesn't make me want to explore the other decision trees, and that speaks to feeling like ""I took the right decision"" every time. I think that's reflected in the statistics as well; and I hope subsequent episodes will do a better job at putting harder choices in front of me.In episode 1, most choices had a temporary impact on the periphery of the main plot, which created a nice blend of having a good/impactful story while living with the choices you made. It seems to be the same way in Season 2, and I'm okay with that. Like everyone else, I wish there was a true branch somewhere along the line, but I can appreciate how much more expensive the game would turn out to be with that kind of structure.So - overall, yes; it's absolutely worth your 20$, your time and your interest. There's nothing unexpected or dramatically innovative in the way Season 2 works, but the reason you play this game is its story, and - just like in the first Season - Season 2 definitely seems poised to deliver the goods."

The gameplay and story never felt boring for the 1.5 hrs that i played. It makes you feel like you are actually playing as Clementine due to the decisions you have to make and every decision has a huge impact on the story. I actually feel that the game is even better than season 1. The game is near perfect but i am still slightly disappointed by certain things.At least for Episode 1, i did not see anything that could have mattered if you played S1 and the 400 Days DLC other than the starting characters ( which i'm not sure if the first game had any effect on that) and small mentions to previous decisions in S1. no other character other than the 2 at the start of S2 had any cameo or even mention and that was disappointing. However, i won't spoil anything but they did hint at it during the preview for Ep2.I also wanted the episodes to be longer. i was hoping for at least 2.5 hrs of gameplay per EP but it seems to be similar to the previous games where its only 1 to 1.5 hrs long. However, it is long enough to make it a interesting and fun EP and by no means does it ruin the game.Lastly, i was hoping for steam trading cards and cloud saves. However, Im sure trading cards will be added later and cloud saves are not a big issue since you can manually do a back up. it DOES make things slightly more difficult however.Those are small issues and by no means make it a bad game. Telltale succeeds in bringing back the point-and-click genre and shows that you do not need to have a big budget or be a FPS/ shooter to have a great story or to be fun and exciting.judging by EP1, i would give this game a 9/10. it could be my GOTY"

We now follow Clementine's journey north after the events that took place in Savannah, Georgia. You play as Clementine and you'll encounter hardships and trials a little girl should never have to face. It'll have you cringing, looking away from your monitor and looking back again with your hands over your head. I've never cringed due to a game before but this just hits the right emotional spots. They made me care for the safety of a video game character. The only other studio, in my case, that has accomplished that was Crystal Dynamics with their Tomb Raider reboot. But there was a difference. I cared about Lara Croft in a pseudo-romantic way. I care about Clementine like how a father cares about a child.I've only played through the first episode of season 2, and I must say I'm grinding my teeth for more. It's as good as the first season, if not better, and it shows promising potential in areas where it can outdo the first. Kudos Telltale Games, another job well done.

,Recommended,261030,8240447,"Posted: 23 December, 2013",all,Lyca,"I loved The Walking Dead: Season 1 by Telltale Games, and I also love the show and browsed the much more gore-filled comics. I thought at first that switching the main protagonist from an adult man like the first season, to the little girl that portrayed the daughter-like character would somehow diminish the story somehow and feel like you had less control of situations, but that's not the case: I felt it was much more fun to play as Clem than Lee, in fact.Telltale likes to tell a great story, and they successfully did so in this season, which I can tell by the, at this time, one episode that's released. You will get a love-hate relationship so strong that you will feel like you are in an abusive relationship with someone you love and still love them anyways. Some of the choices they have make me want to kill them (and they will make you feel) and might have been better if you could somehow change the outcome (like the very beginning, but I guess the story would be much different if it had a split option).Overall, in season 1 I only cried during the finale of the game (season 1, episode 5), but this season has already made me tear up in just the first episode and I'm not afraid to admit that. Season 1 made you care so much for the character you now control, to the point where they feel real and like family to you, and when you see them in danger you will do whatever you can to fix it.Even if you have zombie fatigue...

Season Two of Telltale's fantastic Walking Dead, Season Two lives up to its expectations. Although it is perhaps a little short, the story continues seemlessly into Season 2, as the player is put into the shoes of Clementine. Her development and story here from child to adult is just as emotionally charged as Seaon 1, and is a requirement if you loved Season 1. Characters are again Telltale's niche, and the ones on offer here are just as engaging as in Season One. Only negatives are its play time which edges on the short-side, and the reduced number of puzzels in comparrison to Season One.+ Continues the fantastic narrative.+ Again, characters are interesting and dynamic.+ Clemtine's transition into adulthood is wonderful writing.+ Morally ambiguous choices which stick with the player.- A little short in length- Reduced number of puzzels/hub areas in comparrison to Season One."

Forced stupidity and bad choices the player has no control over for the sake of manufactured drama just shouldn't come that early in the game.  At the very least, such railroading shouldn't come amidst offering the player other, benign choices in the same time frame."

But yeay Clementine.Whereas I shed a tear at the end of season 1, I was simply annoyed during the second half of season 2. There are nearly no puzzles or interesting gameplay mechanics that would keep me invested. Annoying gameplay: A room with 5 interactable objects, one of them which progresses the story. If you pick it first, you'll not get the chance to interact with the other 4. The game goes simply on and you have to reload if you are curious. It's not more than a simple interactive story at most times. Which is ok, but it leaves the player out too much by holding their hand too much.The story developed ok over the first half but then it lost me. Shorter than season 1 it could not establish the connection it had before. The first three episodes are enjoyable due to the plot and its one twist, but after that it just gets boring, producing false climaxes and an unsatisfying ending.If you're interested in the story about Clementine and what happened to her after the emotional ending in season 1, you should play it through. Personally I expected more and was left unsatisfied."

Although only the first episode is out at this point it really does well. The choice gameplay returns with even more tough things you will be forced to decide upon. Although the first seaon's start was a bit slow due to getting you used to the character and characters around you season 2 picks up after season 1 ends off with the remaining survivor(s) of the first game and the plot keeps moving foward at a constant pace and we get nice introductions to the new people you will run across all with some more fantastic music that sets the mood for the scenes it's all great. Season 1 was perfection and with Season 2 off to an even better start if they keep up this pace we are looking at another GOTY winner folks.

In fact, the child is often the only one acting as an adult-the other characters have no consistency-the episodes are too short, the stories are often uninteresting (except for ep.1 and 3), some of them are just a total waste of time (ep. 4)-the choice you make have absolutely no incidence on the story-the gameplay is weak : no puzzle, you're just invited to click 3/4 times per episode of the screen (except opening scene in ep. 1 and closing scene in ep. 3)-and last but not least, the scenario is full of incoherences, the worst being the very end of ep. 5, which is complete nonesense"

The whole game screams ""Your choices matter!"" which is one gigantic lie. Characters can be killed off in earlier parts of the season, but it makes no difference if you keep them alive, or kill them on the spot. I recall one moment of the game, where I chose to save a character (You know who if you've played it) just to have them die literally 15 minutes later. There was also a point in time where I saved a character in Episode 2 just to have him mutter a few words and dies a few episodes later. And I can't forget that pointless 400 days DLC. Even if you managed to save a few characters, they only make small cameos and disappear from the game for the rest of the time. Most of the characters you run into are very forgetable, and lack development. Oh, and don't forget that every adult in the game is useless! At one point, they can't figure out how to turn on a windmill, so who else to go to but the 11 year old girl, right?I would, however, highly recommend Season One if you don't have it already. Season Two just couldn't deliver with all the hype Season One had."

,Recommended,261030,11961394,"Posted: 2 September, 2014",all,SEVALICOUS,While the first season was incredible I found this season to be lacking in the character driving moments. I didn't feel particuarly attached to anyone but Kenny until the very last episode and felt that my choices meant even less than they did in the first season. also this season eliminated even the very simple puzzles that could extend gameplay and make it feel like you were actually advancing through the world. However on the positive the gameplay has improved dramtically and playing as Clem is great.All and all I can still recommend the game. But only just barely.

,Recommended,261030,11474140,"Posted: 30 July, 2014",all,ArmoKr,"Even better than the previous season. To begin, I'm a big fan of Telltale games. The first game I experienced with choices and decisions that can influence the path of the story and with this kind of cinematic-playtime-choice making type of game was Heavy Rain. Obviously, it's not the same game at all but it was kind of like it in some ways. I hated it. When I played the first walking dead game Telltale games made, I completely changed my mind about this type of games. It was simply... awesome. Here's what the game is about.:The Walking Dead series put you (the protagonist) through a series of events that could occur during a zombie apocalypse, leaving you in a situation where you'll have to make choices to gain trust, to decide what to do in a certain situation, to express who you are and how you'd react to similar events. The story is probably one of the greatest tales I've heard in my whole life. It will play with your emotions and action is always around every corner. This game is fantastic.I suggest watching a video of a playtrough just to see the first 5 minutes if you don't know what to expect but I strongly recommand both games and a similar game, The Wolf Amoung Us, made by Telltale Games too which is very good."
,Recommended,261030,9347680,"Posted: 4 March, 2014",all,Replica,"The makers of Depression the game bring you Depression the game 2.Now that it's finally finished, I thought I'd give it a proper review. The second game is fantastic, but it just doesn't measure up to the first. It contains a mostly new cast of characters, but it lacks the interaction the first game has. As Lee you were given the chance to explore the area and solve puzzles, but also speak with your fellow survivors Mass Effect style. The game generally lacked such interactions, so there wasn't any real attachment to the characters like the first game. Most deaths didn't really matter, they just felt cliche. I found myself saying ""oh well"" rather than ""oh no"", and only one or two deaths really affected me. Then there's a problem with Tell Tale's story telling, where it become obvious what is going to happen. If given the choice to save someone, that person is going to die later, making your actions pointless.Don't get me wrong though, this is still a good game. Their where some moments that really hit home, and where well worth playing through. The game tests your morals and reminds us that there might not always be a right or wrong choices. You just need to make them, and keep moving forwards. The game is worth playing if you've played and loved the original.8/10"

I do try to not spoil that much tho :)Of course i recommend the game. After that badass first game, the second season kept the high standards.The story is, again, very well written and has cliffhangers and unexpected moments everywhere. You can never pretend what is going to happen next. And you really catch yourself being speechless, because something happened you never expected or a situation or reaction didn't turn out as you thought. The developers really created a very thoroughful game. That's for certain.In case of the characters. They are as good as the once from the first game. A lot of different personalities. All as different as a bunch of desperate survivors can be. Some are sad, some are aggressive and some you like the moment you meet them the first time. And yet everybody can change the next moment. It all depends on how you play. Very good job.The graphics are still the same, but that isn't somethign negative per se. If you like that style you are happy if not you are either screwed or you try to deal with it. Trust me after some time you don't even notice it anymore because the story and characters are so fascinating. You just want to get on and on and on :)Some new game mechanics found their way into the game as well. Not many tho. It pretty much is more like a little enhancement. YOu have a wheel now where you can choose from different options that you can perform. Chatting or grabbing or looking. You cann decide it now via a simple mouseclick and don't have to scroll down now. Also there are now some new QTE. You can now dodge here and there and clem can run ...... i wouldn't call it run, but she can move faster now :)Other than that. The game is like the first one. Great.

So with that in mind, I think the whole season is actually pretty good. I was entertained mostly and while the episodes are short, who really wants them to drag it out? It was a quick and to the point aftermath of Season 1, and the ending (No Spoilers) was a good one, never going to top the original, but they knew that and gave us something a little different this time. I just wish that there was more choice/consequence variety in the series. While you would expect Season 2 to have a little more, it doesn't. I'd say it's worth a play if you enjoyed Season 1 and want to see the aftermath. Direct and to the point. A good game and I'd give it 7.5/10 for a good effort at following up the first."

The stakes are higher, and while season 1 has you bond with Clementine on a personal level, season 2 directly puts you in her shoes, allowing you to mold and shape her character even further. This was a brilliant move for a variety of reasons, as given Clementine's age, she's physically far weaker than Lee was in season 1. Instead, she has to approach dangerous scenarious by being quick and clever in order to survive, making you feel more helpless than you did in S1. This changes things up a lot and I'm very happy with the direction Telltale took. Additionally, depending on the choices you make during the final episode, you have access to a variety of drastically different endings that from the looks of things, will give everyone a very different season 3, thus increasing the replayability.Well done Telltale.. you've done it again."

TellTale has outdone themselves and has made a game that I can talk to my friends about and come back again and again to get different endings and feelings. The decisions are hard and even though at some points you wonder why every one is looking to a little girl for help you can forgive and forget because it gets intense and you need to hlp two people, but you know one of them will die.

I've already completed S1 on xbox and I just played the first episode of S2. This game is something else let me tell you. There isn't any middle ground or any sort of ""oh you didn't really decided anything, don't worry, it'll happen anyway"". Every time you have to make a split second decision on this you feel the panic as if you were actually there and thats what truely captures that frightened, survivor feel.Without spoiling anything, imagine if you have to choose between going with one person and choosing another, its a panicked situation and you don't have time to plan out the decision so choose quickly and choose NOW. These make or break scenarios which are scattered both obviously and subtley are what makes this and any other similar telltale game a masterpiece.Its been beautiful watching Telltale become the powerhouse in game and story telling that they now are.

,Recommended,261030,13561631,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,Audeez,"Zombie fiction in general, but especially this season of Telltale’s The Walking Dead often beg the question: do you have to be stupid to survive the zombie apocalypse or does surviving the zombie apocalypse just make you stupid?I thought season one of Telltale’s The Walking Dead was filled with morons, but it can’t hold a candle to season two’s cast of self-centered, bickering, half-wits. Having played the first episode back when it was originally released, I jumped back into the shoes of Clementine to tackle the Zombie ridden mid-Atlantic yet again. Feeling much more formulaic than the first season and dragging a bit due in part to their attempt to create their own “Governor” character in the first three episodes, The Walking Dead Season Two didn’t quite have the punch of the first especially when it became obvious that any decision I made was going to be “wrong” in some way. Toward the end I decided that the game was no longer about survival or choosing the correct path. With the plethora of idiots and disappointment I was being faced with, I decided that my ultimate goal was to make sure that Clem didn’t end up as stupid and overall awful as these people.All told, despite its uber dismal tone, The Walking Dead Season Two was still entertaining, enjoyable, and well made. After having played The Wolf Among Us however I did find myself missing certain quality-of-life features like not having to press “E” after mashing “Q” during quick time events, or being able to easily see and understand quick time directional cues. Even the credits are friendlier in The Wolf Among Us, because I can skip them, a nice feature to have when you’replaying episodes back to back.

,Recommended,261030,12217347,"Posted: 24 September, 2014",all,CinderellaMan,"WDS2 continues from S1 with Clementine escaping the chaos, continuing her journey with some familiar friends.  In the WD tradition things head south quickly and we begin the next chapter in this excellent interactive story.In terms of gameplay there have been a few small changes from S1, primarily in that the narrative and characters are getting more emphasis as I believe they should in this format.  There are no actual puzzles to solve here; however there are occasional moments of interaction and minor exploration.  There are some QTEs also, possibly more than the previous game, which succeed in creating tension.The big emphasis hewever is shaping Clementine through her frequent dialog choices.  Will she be cold and heartless?  Will she be reserved but empathetic?  Will she be courageous and pious?  There are many more dialog choices in this season, and the impact on the way other characters perceive Clementine is noticeable.  As with last season, your choices can impact who lives or dies... although in some situations you have no choice but to determine how Clementine deals with the death of a friend.As with S1 the general story progression is fixed but minor plot points and character relationships can be influenced by your actions and dialog.  You could replay the game and try some different choices but I suspect the outcome would not be very rewarding.Graphically the game feels a bit improved but only incrementally.  The animation seems a bit smoother and the facial expressions are also improved.  The style remains hand drawn cartoon-inspired which is appropriate.All in all I'm glad that Telltale decided to focus on the narrative and character development.  Rarely does a game invoke an emotional response like this one did.  I am looking forward to another season of this series and will snatch it up for sure.9/10"

Which is a good thing considering some of the grisly deaths you might meet. Speaking of which, don't expect the death scenes in S2 to be any less gruesome than those in S1 just because it now stars an 11-year old girl. Just like in S1 the nailbiting moments are there, the heart-wrenching moments are there, as well as the occassional WTF?! moment.One issue I have with season 2 is that the story didn't grip me as much as the first. And I think that's mainly because there's too much happening too fast. You rarely get a moment of reprieve in which you can really see some character development of the supporting cast, although it does make it all the more enjoyable when you do get one.That said it's still a great story with Clem being an excellent protagonist. If you played the first one and liked it, chances are you'll like this one. Fingers crossed for a Season 3!"

I love games with a story and found that story in this virtual choose-your-own-adventure styled cell-shaded game.  Dark, gritty, and emotionally tearing, you'll find yourself in love with the protagonist's efforts to survive. Without the use of spoilers, I reached an integral part of Chapter 2 in Season 2 and it made me think...""What would have happened if I had done the other thing or if I didn't do things as well in the first game?""Needless to say, I went back and am currently playing Season 1 again just to try something different so that Season 2 will dynamically differ from the first.You want a story?Buckle up.Your emotions are going for one hell of a ride."

Then, it wouldn't let me go until I was crying in the foetal position because of the choices I had made.It's pretty rare for a game to have characters that you genuinely care about, not just modern titles.The Walking Dead has the best characterisation I've seen for a long time. Clementine (and Lee from Season 1) is one of the most sympathetic characters out there.It's really tough to describe. It's something you have to experience first-hand.If you enjoy single-player experiences like I do, you're doing yourself a disservice by not buying The Walking Dead Seasons 1 and 2.

(P.S., I don't give conventional ?/10 scored because that's dumb.)Anyways, the story. I won't bother outlining this story because it's the most immersive choose your own adventure you could possibly imagine. Well, second most.Honestly, I don't think this season of Telltale Game's The Walking Dead quite surpasses or equals season 1. Season 1 was phenomenal, I got emotionally attached to characters, I think the voice acting was better, and I cried more than once when certain characters, um, were no longer in the game. I think season two forgoes that same emotional attachment in favor of shock. Don't get me wrong, the story in season 2 is phenomenal, one of the best story telling in the whole of the entertainment industry, but it's just not as moving as season 1. Perhaps one of the reasons of that is because there was so much ""down time"" in season 1 that you really had a chance to get to know the characters and listen to every line of dialouge. Rare was the moment in season 2 where you could just walk around and talk to the characters and really get to know and empathize with them. There is still plenty of dialouge and superb voice acting in season 2, it just doesn't surpass season 1 is all. I didn't shed a tear, but I did think to myself ""oh holy black baby jesus. what's gonna happen next??"" or ""what the HELL am I supposed to do now??"" and I love the amount of moral choices that season 2 forces you to make. There is no ""good"" or ""bad"" choice most of the time, and it's not a linear story in the slightest.So, if for some reason Telltale Game's The Walking Dead somehow hasn't made it on your radar, pick up the first season. It's well worth full price. As for season 2.....I'd wait for it to go on some sort of sale or humblebundle. It's excellent, and it didn't leave a sour taste in my mouth, but this sequel just wasn't as good as season 1.If I reeeeeeally had to give a conventional ?/10 rating, here it is.Season 1: 9.5/10 maybe even 10/10Season 2: 8 or 9/10"

,Recommended,261030,8740258,"Posted: 17 January, 2014",all,Hola Uriberto,"DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A PARTIAL VISION OF THE GAME IN THE CURRENT STATE AS OF 1/17/2014.THIS REVIEW WILL GET UPDATED AS EACH EPISODE COMES OUT.Telltale's The Walking Dead is back with yet another season of heartbreaking zombie apocalypse stories.This time we control Clementine, the girl from season one, while she travels North to escape the madness in the cities. Controlling Clementine may sound crazy; she's a kid and all that. Telltale noticed that too I guess because they let some time pass between season one and this season so she can grow up a little in this world and roughen up. It worked. Clementine is a tough kid who grew up in a world of brutal and savage survival with bad people in each corner and surrounded by the dead.All actions in season one somewhat have repercussions in the events between last season and season two, and Clementine remembers all Lee taught her.In terms of technical factors, this game uses the same engine, albeit a little changed in terms of UI, but it's virtually the same gameplay and graphics. Remember, in this game the important thing is the story, not the rest. The engine is good enough for me and the graphics are inspired by the comic books so it's cool, and the gameplay is awesome as always with all Telltale games.Finally, if you're expecting a zombie shooter, go get DayZ or something like that. If you like adventure games like Monkey Island, Maniac Mansion, Sam and Max and all that, and love drama and zombies, this game is for you.Now, I'll begin reviewing each episode. This review will be updated as I play each episode as they come out. I'll try to keep it spoiler-free as much as I can.__________________________________________________EPISODE ONE: ALL THAT REMAINSThis episode has a chapter which serves as re-introduction, helping you to remember all that happened in season one, and makes the leap to the current events bringing you up-to-date with where and how the group (or what's left of it) is.However, soon after you start the game, tragedy will come. I mean, seriously. First 5 minutes and you'll already be crying, so you can expect that.After that sad part, all will brighten up a little. But it will be taken from you again. Yes. This game is an emotional rollercoaster.New characters will be introduced and you will see each of them develop, either by themselves or by the actions Clementine takes. I must say the new characters are really good and I expect a lot from them. From some I've already seen how they are and what they're capable of, how good and caring some are and just how sad or how crazy or bad others are. Also, Clementine is surprisingly good in reading other people. She could tell how they were just by listening to them a little. An useful skill I must admit, because in that world it's needed to know who you can trust.In the end, there will be a decision similar but not entirely equal to the one in A New Day. You will have to choose quickly this time, because now it has a timer and you being idle will count as an option too, leading to three possible outcomes. I encourage you try them all because they are all great.The next episode will be cool and will bring some unexpected (or totally expected?) surprises, as we can see in the trailer at the end of the game, which once again will reflect your actions and decisions from this episode.Season 2 is up to a great start, and I hope all episodes keep this quality standard. I really enjoyed this, as it is really as good as season one, which was perfect in every sense.Too bad we now have to wait for episode two. Well, I'll sit down until it's out... is it out yet!?!?!?__________________________________________________EPISODE TWO: A HOUSE DIVIDEDSeason 2 continues and it's starting to take shape! We did our waiting and I must say that although it was long and I suffered it, this episode had a lot of stuff in it and surprised me. I played it twice to see how many outcomes there were and I could see there were many, which is awesome because it's like having many stories.This episode brings back a character we thought lost, adds even more characters to the cast, and unmasks the main antagonist. We also get more character development and get to see the human nature at its finest. The apocalypse starts becoming more and more political. Tensions and issues begin to surface.The finale was great and it's there where we get to see the more different outcomes which dramatically change how we'll continue.All in all, it was an excellent episode, and I can't wait for the next. Too bad Telltale is taking so long to release these. I just hope they hurry and get the next episode for this (and The Wolf Among Us) out by at least April.__________________________________________________EPISODE THREE: IN HARM'S WAYThe most brutal The Walking Dead episode yet. Can't say anything else about this episode. All I can say is, after playing this, the Governor and Negan are sissypants compared to what you see here.I can't wait for the next episode.__________________________________________________EPISODE FOUR: AMID THE RUINSThis is where it all went downhill. We see now that the choices we made don't matter. There are choices in this episode that won't matter in the end. We'll see that even if we do or do not do something, it won't have effect in the future as things will be the same. I believe Telltale focused on The Wolf Among Us so much they didn't care about The Walking Dead anymore, because this is the laziest written episode yet.__________________________________________________EPISODE FIVE: NO GOING BACK... aaaaaaand it's still ridden with lazy writing. Every single thing that happened in this episode makes you think ""I played through all this to see THAT happening?"". I mean, it desperately tries to cling on to the past, like they're afraid that this season wouldn't do as well as the first one; it makes a lot of unnecesary reminders that Lee was the best, showing scenes from season one... YES, LEE WAS THE BEST, BUT IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON. I feel like this season was a reminder that season one was great and nothing else. It's like the things that happened here didn't matter at all; all that matters is ""what would Lee do if he was here"". And this is why I feel like this episode fails altogether. Rushed, with twists and turns to the worst every time they could. How did it come to this?But hey, the ride was sweet while it lasted. I still recommend it because up until episode four it was worth playing. It still is, but the last two episodes really weren't as good as the first few. I blame The Wolf Among Us, which was awesome, and probably made Telltale have to cut a few things here and there from The Walking Dead to make the other game a success. But still pisses me off. Really, a lot."

,Recommended,261030,11882289,"Posted: 27 August, 2014",all,41488,"I want to make one thing straight about Telltale's version of The Walking Dead:As a piece of interactive fiction, it is a masterpiece. Writing is top-notch, having all the cliffhangers and tough decisions of something like Spec Ops, but not going too overboard with its twists (like for example reviving Lee for fanservice). Choices are truly tough, and all of them matter, but what's most important is that there is NEVER a right choice. Each and every situation has two sides, and both are equally right. Like Lee advises in No Going Back, you will always hurt someone, even if you help another. The Walking Dead: Season 2 has more than one occasion forced me to go with my true gut feeling- and left me feeling like♥♥♥♥♥♥afterwards because I thought I didn't do the right thing. No game, not even non-electronic CYOA's have done this to me. If this was a TV series or a movie, it'd be taking in the Emmies and Oscars. It's just that good.But, as a ""normal"" game, it's♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you're looking for choices that actually change the storyline, and you actually having a noticeable influence in a game's main plot (for example, quest lines in Mass Effect or Skyrim), turn away. Like many people have commented, it's almost like watching a movie play out. You don't do as much choosing as you do just staring at the screen. Graphics, animations, and polish are all below-par compared to other games, even indie ones.That, however, is the reason why I'm recommending this game.You see, The Walking Dead: Season 2, is not a game. It's a piece of art. It's something that makes you care, makes you question yourself. You will be thinking about the choices you have made long after you've quit out of the main menu and back onto your desktop. You will be dreaming about this game, asleep or not.Your choices don't matter, but your interactions with characters do- both on you, Clementine, and the character themselves. Your viewpoints don't matter, but the way you look at things may shape your decisions later on down the line. The items you pick up and use don't matter. In fact, only one time in the game (maybe more- I've only done one playthrough thus far) will exploring the environment yield objects that will have an impact later on down the line, and not just on the current scene. And even if you do pick up that object and give that object to a certain character, it doesn't do much but to make them feel better. Which also doesn't matter because they actually don't show up that much in the next episode.This game is sort of like a driving trip I took this summer. On the way to my destination, I saw landscapes and scenery I had never seen before in my life. I went through 7 days of that to reach my destination- only to realize that it was an overhyped attraction. I ended up spending about 20 minutes in the place I drove 7 days to reach. My point is, TWD: S2 is that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ destination: what matters isn't the place you're going to. What matters is what you do to reach that place. Like that driving trip, I realized I could enjoy the game much better if I spent more time looking at the roses, instead of rushing forward to the ending for achievements. Immersing myself in the atmosphere, paying attention to dialogue, getting to actually know and trust characters- all of them added to my experience in this game, even if none of that mattered in the end (the 5 endings of the game can be picked no matter your prior choices, and *SPOILER* almost everyone dies no matter what you do).This isn't a game. It's more than that.If this game was a raccoon, I'd eat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out if it.11/1."

The choices you have to make are excruciating. By the end of the episode, you feel as if you truly lost some good friends. I rarely if never feel emotional after a game but this game is an exception. Telltale knows how to pull on your heartstrings. If you can make it thru the end without shedding a tear, you are not human.This game overall deserves a 10/10. Worth every penny and every second of your time. If you plan to only play one game this year, this along with Telltale game's other masterpiece Wolf Among Us should be on that short list. I can't wait to see how Telltale will try to one up this emotional roller coaster with season 3. This is easily a contender for best story of 2014 and dare I say GOTY.

Although Season 2 seems to have more available endings, only 1 or 2 really leave you feeling a sense of closure.One gripe I do have with season 2 is that it seems to provide even less choice to the player than season 1 did. It frequently gives the illusion that you are making an important decision but in the end, it doesn't actually matter (the same events occur regardless). In one instance, you have a chance to save a major character - if you do so, the character still ends up getting killed later in the episode anyway regardless of what you chose.However, the story and the characters are all still really incredibly interesting and well-written, as always. This is still yet another fantastic experience crafted by Telltale Games, and if you enjoyed Season 1 you really need to play this."

It's possible that the simple lack of novelty is the problem, but it feels more like the story just isn't engaging. One problem is that the biggest character to return from the first game (other than clementine) is one that was incinsistent and non-sympathetic...it's not like ""hey, there's someone we know, great!"", it's more like ""Oh geez, that (expletive)? I thought/hoped he/she was dead!""Anyway...feels like kind of a swing and miss to me, like the magic's gone this time.

The consequences of your choices may do noting, change your relationship with someone  or kill someone and make your cry ;( . After this game no matter what gender you are you FEEL like you are Clemintime and you are in the apocalypse. The game macanics work magically with the point and click gameplay style at first you may find it boring but then it just ...... words can not explain. The moment you think the group you are in are safe something happens and in this game you find someone not saying who for those who have played the first game and not shore if this game is worth but when you find him you will nit look at any more the one option to humg him :) . This game somehow (I was not expecting it) was miles better then the first one when you see Clemintime make the choices no child should make it makes you feel as if you are loosing who she was in the first game but you can see glimses of her through out the game. I feel the main object of the game is not to survive but to keep Clem and the group from becoming monsters and no not the walkers but monsters who have no emotion. The only downfall of this game is that there is a few technical hiicups now and then but they won't bother you in the slightest.  In conclusion if you havn't played the first one buy that and if you enjoy it buy this and if you have allready played the first one (the chances are that you enjoyed/that game was your life) buy this ;) 10/10"

Most of the game is carried by the story, the weight of the choices you make, and the interactions between the characters.Unfortunate that Season Two is a display of some of the problems with interactive fiction. Ultimately, you can't really change much throughout the story, and while there are technically five endings, you aren't really influencing much in the game. A lot of the time is spent waiting between major moments, and then these seemingly big things turn out to be nothing.I still had a good time with it, but Season One was better and I'm kind of questioning Season Three.

If you are reading this with no prior knowledge to the game, please read a review for the first game. you have been warnedAh, The Walking Dead. A game which, although I haven't played in a while, I can still remember every detail of.The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a sequel from the game The Walking Dead (quite self explanatory really). You asume the role of Clementine, a young teenager (aging up from the previous game) who was left with a babysitter while her parents went to Savannah for a vacation. Little did they know that there vacation was to be cut short. As the name suggests, the dead become the undead and begin walking around and grunting in the usual zombie way, leaving Clementine in a world of death and torment. She leaves the safety of her home to travel with a man called Lee who does everything in his power to protect her. You are faced with many different characters and personalities, much like real life and are forced to make decisions based on the situation. The best part about it, you're in control of those choices.As I've given the story, I may as well review that element first.The story is the main element of this game and makes it into what it is. The choices that you make affect the story heavily and drive to connect with the characters that you have been presented with, be it that you feel like being a complete badass throughout the whole of the game, threatening to kill someone for trying to tickle you or being the friendly and conserved type. Lets be honest though. who plays nice in these games?The emotional connection that you get with some of the characters is absolutely phenomenal. When you start playing this, chances are you will probably end up caring for some people more than you care about some of your so-clled 'friends' that you swear that you have but always seem to be busy when you want to do something with them. Lets be real though. Who needs real-life friends when you've got all the people you could ever want to talk to here?Next up is the gameplay.The Walking Dead has a rather different style of play to most games. It's a break from the old FPS and MOBA genres which now appear to steal the show. However, the actual gameplay is very limited. Remember I said that the story is the main element? Yep, that's what this game is. The Walking dead has been from the first game 3 different modes of gameplay. A mode where everyone is calm and has no problem going on at that particular time and so you have all the time in the world. A mode where the previous mode requires you to make a fast decision and finally a mode where you mash buttons. The first and second mode play out like a game of detective. You move the mouse until you find what it is you're looking for to progress with the story. I guess you could say there are technically 4 if you include parts where there are 4 diffferent dialogue options for you to choose from. This is also usually timed but in some cases is not. In Season 2, there are quick-time events which require you to do things such as using the arrows to move left and right or pressing a specific key in order to do certain actions.As you can currently see, not much in terms of technicality. But that's the beauty of it. The simplicity really does make this game better as it focuses on the finer details of the game as opposed to games that rely on their complex mechanics to which the game-devs scratch their heads in confusion. The Walking Dead focuses in on the story, using the timer and the atmosphere to put the player at an emotional disadvantage and make them reall consider their choices in-game.The best part about this game is the way in which it is meant to be played over many times to get the different outcomes and to play in different ways to which the player gets to choose. Also, thank TellTale Games for placing 3 save slots so that you get to do a playthrough of to get the different endings, all ready for the next game to come out. If it does that is.The art style of this game is also very creative, using hand-drawn textures which suit the games style and mood. This also makes it much easier to run for those who don't have good PC's meaning that the game's experiences are to be shared with everyone.These are the overall Scores:-Story:- 9/10 - Very memorable and really hits the player hard. Draws emotional attachment out of the player. My only criticism is the way in which the majority of the choices have no bearing on what happens in the endGameplay:- 7/10 - I had a lot of fun playing through this game and even cried towards the end, but sequences eventually become easy and there is no difficulty in the completion. It is very rare you will fail. Also, trying to find what you need to do to progress can become annoying.Textures/Art-style:- 9/10 - A beautiful game with stunning scenes that make an impact on its own. The scenes in this game really show off the atmophere and feeling.Can't ask for much more than that.Replayability:- 10/10 - This is where this game really excels. The multiple choice element to this game makes you want to go back and redo the whole game again, leaving your mind with the 'What-if?' thought constantly after you make a decision.Overall:- 9/10 - Overall, this game is a must buy. It is one of the biggest emotional rollrcoasters you are likely to go on. Hell, I think I would have cried less if you had made me chop onions. If you locked me in a room with this game, I'd cry every time you put me through having to watch the closing scenes.I hope this gave you some insight as to whether you would want to buy this game (please do) and I hope it helps :)"

But once you get into it, it feels like a natural progression. All the hard work and effort you put into Lee is still with you, but both the player and Clem have lost him, so I think it helps the switching of view points. Loved the first Episode from start to finish really, and I won't spoil anything here, but if you're a fan of the Walking Dead, I think it stays true to the hype that the first game greated, and possibly looks set to become even better than it's predecessor."

The second season enhances the experience offered to us in the first one with an easy to use user interface and more drama. This game purely focuses on the events after the first game and '400 Days' DLC- taking previous save files into account for how certain characters react or whether or not they even appear. The events vary in pace though still following the 'quick time' game mechanic. This games strength lies in the endings and the fact it does end for most."

I've known about them ever since the first demo for season 1 came out, I finally decided to purchase the games. I really enjoyed season 2 a lot. I love Clem and it's quite interesting to see how a young but brave girl behaves in the apocalypse. I just didn't really like how this season is much shorter than season 1, I thought that Telltale could had add more things into the game and longer chapters. I was really upset over Luke's death as well. He is my favorite character from season 2. He was very supportive of Clem while many of the characters would make comments like ""She's just a kid"". Yeah, she is a kid but she's been & seen a lot already. They had a brother and sister relationship that I thought was cute. I would of prefer Kenny Vs Luke, rather than Jane. I think that could of been a tougher choice for me to make at the end. Good game, can't wait for season 3."

To me, it felt almost as if the developers were coercing me into developing stronger bonds with specific survivors. Another character from the previous season was also brought back mid-way through the game, making the unfolding events even more interesting.All in all, through this play of the characters and decisions the player is forced to make, S2 definitely felt like a much tougher test of the player's morals and ethics. Just like the previous season, a great story, and an incredible finale that leaves the player conflicted, even numb, but looking forward to the next one!Performance on my system seemed like it was a bit laggier than the previous title, and this is unlikely on account of hardware, judging by performance of more graphically challenging games.

There's multiple endings to this game which I really hope they branch off if they make a third season (Which totally seems like they will, it'd be blastphemy if they don't).It's good to see that the developers have improved how the game plays compared to the first as well. For example, holding the shift key will make you move a little faster, and instead of using the mouse wheel to scroll through actions, you have a circle which pops up with your options, and the dialogue options are much larger too. Not to mention the fact that the decisions which you make in this game feel like they have more of an impact, and you can make the story a lot more the way you want it to be.If you're a fan of this series, it's definitely worth looking in to, I'd recommend getting the first game and playing that as well before doing this one, so you aren't missing out on any bits of the story."

It's debatable which game is more emotional (I'd say their on par), but Season 2 is undoubtedly more intense than ever before.Sequels in any form are difficult. Whether it be games, movies or TV shows , it will always be hard to match the original, especially if it is held in such a high regard. I feel Season 2 has suffered some unfair criticism because of it. Season 2 had to do be very different from the first, it couldn't fall into the trap of copying everything that Season 1 did so well, otherwise people would have complained. Since you changed it up a bit people have complained about certain things. No matter what Telltale did, it was impossible for  them to please everybody.Clementine throughout this series has become in my opinion, one of the most consistent, well developed characters I have ever seen. With the options we're presented it's up the player to choose how they wish to develop the character. You can try hold onto her innocence as long as possible, or you can fall under the darker nature of the storyI'd absolutely recommend this game to anybody who enjoys a strong, emotional story. It has a very strong atmosphere, a great soundtrack and some unforgettable moments."

You play as a  more grown up Clementine a few years after the events of season 1, and you experience her development through interaction with new survivors (along with maybe an old one) in the ever-present struggle for survival in the apocalyptic world of the dead. The storytelling of this game rivals or surpasses that of many TV shows and films, in my opinion, and you as the player are faced with many very difficult decisions along the way. My biggest complaint with this game is that it seems that your choices rarely affect the the story, save for Episode 5. Still though, season 2 goes to new, darker places than the original with a character you already care about. If you didn't like the first game, then this game probably won't do anything to change your mind in the series. However if you loved the first game then there is more to love in this one, and it's easy to recommend now that all five episodes are out."

I was given tough choices and had a strong emotional response to every consequence.The continuation from Season One feels seemless now that I recall the events of the past, especially when I see the consequences of the choices in that game affecting the story in this sequel in meaningful ways. At first, the choices I made in Season Two didn't seem so meaningful, but it is slowly creeping up on me as I make progress and the plot begins to unfold. Even the smallest choices have the potential to twist the plot.However, I highly recommend not reading the names of the achievements in this game before returning to the zombie apocalypse. And I personally wouldn't find it enjoyable unless I completed Season One. I can't imagine not experiencing Season One and then even pretending that I understand the protagonist to Season Two.All of what matters to me personally aside, expect a lot of button context actions, dialogue options, and forshadowing that inevitably kicks you in the gut. I honestly don't know why TellTale bothered with so many achievements in an interactive storytelling game, but I can't help but look the other way because this story is told so well that I can't quite put it down. If this series were a physical ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book, then I'd read it until I had to start taping pages back together."

It simply does not seem realistic and whilst I can appreciate that stand-point someone not treating a little girl like a little girl should be a rare occurance, people are different and if we are supposed to believe everyone would just act like that I'm not buying it.Its simply another way of making a strong main character without taking too much of a time gap between where we saw Clementine and Lee so we know whats been happening yet not taking the time of writing it from a little girls perspective and how people would view her, every single person treating her like she's is a 30 year old male is just unrealistic and lazy.There has only been one episode of this game so far and buying a game and getting a small amount of playtime with months in-between the next episode is a bit of a joke, but I can't make a full review based on this one episode but if the characters start treating her a little more realisticly according to what she is (which isn't ment to be positive all the time just accurate) and they do infact give real story and end-game altering choices in this installment then I would say get the game but for now I can't make a solid judgement."

What is the fate of Christa and Omid? Your dearest Clem?Walking Dead Season 2 has a lot of similar aspects to Season 1, but with a better UI, graphics, and just about everything. Dialogue feels more fluid, and controlling Clementine is quite enjoyable, and you'd be surprised at her bravery. Overalll, Walking Dead Season 2 is a great sequel that left me wanting more. If you've never played Walking Dead, buy the first one, and if you enjoy that, definitely this!If you have played the first one and you liked it, you'll definitely like this.SPOILER REVIEWWalking Dead Season 2 opens up with Clem walking with a pregnant Christa and a still cheerful Omid. Omid tells you to clean up, and as your in a bathroom cleaning up, a scavenger walks in and steals your gun, threatening you. Omid comes in slowly, and as he approaches your assaliant, the door shuts making a loud noise. The scavenger turns around and promptly shoots Omid in the chest.Christa comes in and shoots the scavenger dead. Bestowed with dreadful grief.A year later, you and Christa are in a forest, and suddenly when Christa goes out to find wood, she becomes captured by bandits.This is the setup for Season 2, and it is as riveting as it is tearjerking.The story continues on, but I wish not to explain all its anomalies for they differ from your choices, as do all TellTale games...This Episode seemed to merely set up the plot, and I actually found myself missing the locales of Season 1. Hopefully though, maybe we can meet some old faces. Some possibilities are: Lily, Molly, and Kenny, supposing he survived the zombie attack, and because of what Clem(entine) says at the end of the Episode 2 teaser.""I thought you were dead.""9.75/10An overall great game."

Lee helping Kenny or Lee telling Kenny to go F himself felt way more meaningful than compared to Clementine telling Sarah to grow up and quit crying. Making decisions in season one were that impactful it almost made or did make you want to reset the game just so you could make the opposite decision, I don't get that feeling with season two. Season two so far feels rushed, each episode takes around 1 hour to an hour and a half tops to complete and the stroy feels like it hasn't even progressed since the end of the last episode to the beginning of this one. The narrative feels weak in season two as apposed to season one. Season two feels like an animation which is some what interactive and I use ""some what"" loosely. The narritive feels dominant so expect to be sitting with your chin inthe palm of your hand waiting for a dialogue option. The cast of characters in my opinion are very weak as compared to the cast of characters in season one.  Why is an eleven year old character the main potagonist? It takes all believability away from the story and setting that TTG are trying so hard to create. The build up for Kenny's return was sloppy and it fell flat on it's face. The player left Kenny in a ""he's not getting out of that alive situation"" and in season two we're just meant to live with the fact that he survived it, there's no explination, flashback or anything to give the player a realistic idea. The character writting in my opinion is appalling, Kenny being the way he was in season one was okay. That was because we had such a strong lead character - Lee that could keep him grounded, their personalities in that aspect gelled perfectly. No character in season two has a personality that can combat Kenny, now it feels like a grown man who is having his time of the month. For the player, it will get annoying FAST. There is nothing to really complain about in terms of voice acting, except that TTG really should start bringing in more actors instead of giving the parts to the same few people. Adam Harrington being the best voice actor in my opinion to voice act. The transition from Lee - a thirty seven year old to Clementine - an eleven year old was a very bad idea in my opinion. The way characters like Luke and Kenny trust only Clementine to watch their back is innocent in itself, but when they trust her over other adults with guns is completely unrealistic. Sarah is my favourite character for one reason. She is the only believable character, she treats the zombies or ""walkers"" like real threats instead of Luke taking Clementine to clear a bridge full of walkers like it's no deal what so ever. The fact that only one character in The Walking Dead season two treats the enemy as a dangerous threat really annoys me. Sarah is older than Clementine and is treated like an infant when compared.In all, The Walking Dead is a masterpiece. I tried to give an honest overview rather than being a straight up ""fanboy"" If you haven't played it, I'm sorry to say but you're missing out."

You will get your money's worth.In terms of gameplay, the structure of the first instalment pretty much remains. The Walking Dead is not an action game, but rather offers decision-making with a slight tinge of exploration and occasional quicktime events. Although the decisions to choose from are various, sometimes the game leaves you to think ""why didnt they just do this/that"". If you enjoyed the first season, then you will very likely enjoy this one too. If you haven't played S1, then play it first."

,Recommended,261030,11889933,"Posted: 27 August, 2014",all,RIP Pancho,"Not as impressive as the first game, but still a well written piece of fiction.The reason I don't believe this game is as good as Season 1 is simply because you learn from the game as it progresses. What I mean is, you really start to notice that this game doesn't really care what you decide to do, in the end it's not about if you made the right or wrong decision, it's all about just progressing. And that sort of alleviates the power of ""choice"". I've noticed this a lot in games, not just the Walking Dead. Games that give you the ""power of choice"" give you a lot of options, but not enough consequences. Like say, you find a man stuck between two cars (THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE GAME), zombies are coming after him, he has tormented your group for a long time now and has clearly established his evilness, what do you do?A) Save himB) Don't save him.Well, if you choose to not save him, he dies. End of that. But what if you choose option B? Well, he still dies. End of that. I've noticed way too much in just the first episode. Everything happens not because you let it happen, but because the developers just didn't want to go to the trouble and make additional cutscenes and dialogue. While this may seem like a bad thing it sort of brings in this theme of fragility and the illusion of choice. We can't always get what we want. Things happen, and we can't always help it, whether we like it or not. I'm not sure if the devs wanted this to be a ""theme"", but it's sort of tiring honestly. Which is why I'm saying this isn't as impressive as the first game, because it's like a magic trick; I know there's a card under the magician's sleeve, so I know how this whole trick is going to go down. However, when I first saw that little piece of illusion happen before my eyes, I was dazzled. Now this game has more smoke and mirrors than a strip club locker room. (Thanks Max Payne 3 for the great quote!)That's just not the only issue we have with the game, but it's also the main character this time around, Clementine. I loved Clementine as a supporting character, and as a symbol of innocence during the first game, and her symbolic image is even stronger in this game because of the fact that she's now a dying piece of purity, showing that♥♥♥♥♥♥is much more drastic than it ever was before. However, now that she's become the leading role, I honestly don't care much for Clem anymore. It's not the fact that she's just a little girl or anything of the sort, it's just the fact that Clementine is no longer an interesting character. Her main piece of interest in the last game was that she was innocent, and that she was someone to protect; an objective throughout the whole game. Now, what's the point anymore? I do love Clementine as a character, strong, mature, and level headed but still just a child, but I can't say I enjoyed playing AS Clementine. Clem should stay a secondary character, she just doesn't fit the role for this game.Speaking of which, the game doesn't feel as grand anymore. Which is strange to say, considering the last game took place in the motel 60% of the time, and this game has you somewhere completely different every single episode, but it's sort of falling for the ""quantity over quality"" thing. I wish it focused more on the objective, whatever that was. It was never really clear. At first it was just survival, then ""Wilmington"" then baby, then, ♥♥♥♥, just GO SOMEWHERE ALREADY! We were in so many places and under so many situations that there was no clear end game and made me sort of not care in the end. It also doesn't help that, because we went so many places and did so much, the cliffhangers sort of failed to grab my interest.Nevertheless, it was a fantasticly written piece, and I loved every character. The game had a LOT of tense moments, and despite me knowing smoke in mirrors trick, I still didn't know how exactly it was going to end. It still felt very heavy and very dangerous, and I loved the game. It's extremely short, so you can totally beat it in a day or two, maybe even three. Either way, it's still worth checking out."

I love the concept, the characters, and TellTale are great in what they did. I've got a HUGE emotional attatchment to each and every character.I played the first game (which is a MUST if you're planning on playing the second) and I loved it.Now, this is why I wont rate Season 2 as good as season 1- Season one took me 20 hours to complete. Season Two took me 8.This isnt because of lack of storyline, the actual story is the same length, and I have no problems with the story. This is because of the lack of the ability to talk and get to know characters.Season One. At the farm. You can go and talk to Katjaa, when shes with Clem. You can talk to Kenny. You can learn about their backstory, where they used to live, and so on.Season Two, without giving away any spoilers, you simply cant.You dont get to learn about the groups past, and a lot of them die off before you get a chance to ask. I'm the type of player who will spend time to talk to every person in between the action scenes. But in SSN2, you dont get the oppourtinity.It sucks, becasue I like finding out about characters. I like knowing about them. But they end up dying, and im left like ""So... What ever happened to them?""One more thing. The ending of SSN1 was powerful, and hit home for most players, because everyone loved Lee. I dont think there was ANYONE who didnt like him at the end. But in season two, without trying to give away the ending- as much as they tried to make a big ending, if you didnt like the characters at the end, the choice wasnt so difficult at all.Like I said, I love the game, and I would still reccomend it to people who want to follow Clementines story. But, I feel like it was rushed, and it could of been thought out a lot more thoroughly before release.If there was a mixed feelings button to post this review as, it would be that, but Im still going to rate it up- becasue at the end of the day- Clementine is great and I still like to know how shes going to follow her story."

Only a moron cannot appreciate something of beauty and will criticise this because he isn't running around shooting like a maniac. Now that the biggest criticism is addressed I will write about why you should play this:What do you get if you buy this?Dozens of hours of intense emotional story telling which lets you interact in minor ways about how things play out. You MUST play season 1 if you intend on playing season 2. I quite literally cried at a few points in this game and that's a rare thing for a person like me to do, but you fall in love with the characters, their voice/acting is marvelous and you definitely get immersed in the story as it unfolds.I don't have anything left to say. Buy this game if you want to kill a dozen or so hours in a beautiful story and reignite your emotional side! There is no excuse to not purchasing this now that season 1 & 2 are on sale.

Back in 2012 when season 1 was brand new, I didn't get it for ages because despite the hype it was a point and click adventure game, how boring does that sound?! I eventually bought it on Sale and was not disappointed, worth every cent and more! Season 2 takes off of course after Season 1 and the ""400 Days"" DLC in-between the two seasons with every choice you make from Season 1 and the DLC 400 Days carried on into Season 2. Just like Season one the graphics were phenomenal and were very appropriate considering the game (and the TV show by the same name by the way) are based off a series of comic books so it fits to have the art style the way it is, but the HUD or well, dialog boxes certainly changed and it was a bit weird and hard for me to get used to but after a few minutes I was fine with it plus it also made more sense.For me the first scene was intense then it got boring then it really picked up after a very unexpected thing happened from being nice, oh I guess I should mention that in Season 2 you play as Clementine rather than Lee who is the protagonist in Season 1 which is very weird but at the same time it was good to get the perspective from an 11 year old girl in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. For those of you who know anything about the game/story you know Clementine is a very smart girl, she can think and act quickly, she can shoot and she can take down zombies or ""walkers"" as they are referred to in this game quicker than a few of the adults, she really is a kick♥♥♥♥♥chick.The story is as good as season 1, spectacular, funny, nerve-racking, scary, action-packed and some of the lines and the way some characters spoke, you can tell the developers didn't half♥♥♥♥♥it and they certainly went all out. There were ups and downs, it was like an emotional rollercoaster! This has got to be one of the only video games (besides season 1 of this series) that I have sat in front of my computer and legitimately cried over something happening in the game, other times I sat there frozen with my hands over my mouth having to take a minute to process what went on. The thing that really gets me is at the end of an episode it will show you a screen letting you know how popular one of the main decisions were and if I am over 50% I am happy but in episode 3 I got one saying ""You and 31% of players did this.."" and I started thinking ""Opps, I did the wrong thing"" but the truth is there is no ""wrong thing"" I played the game the way I wanted to play it and the way I think I would have gone about things in that situation and you don't get to redo that stuff if it was for real so why should you redo it just to get the best possible ending. This is all based on Episodes 1-3 of Season 2 (the second game in The Walking Dead series) with Episodes 4-5 to be released in Summer 2014 but keeping in mind that's probably the American summer. This is another job well done to the guys over at Telltale studios and I applaud them for their outstanding work on such an amazing game and to this day I am yet to know of a game with a better story, or a show/movie I care about the characters more than the characters in The Walking Dead video game."

Movies these days are so hollow and characters so shadowy, its been such a long time since I felt so strongly about a fictional situation and its characters involved.It also taught me a small lesson about myself when it comes to making hard decisions - and although maybe I havent experienced a situation close to the high octane stresses of trying to survive a zombie apocalypse with tensions and trusts with others to the point of breaking, I've always been a huge fence sitter. I don't like conflict and I dont like making the hard calls. Being in the hot seat in this game made me realise that sometimes there is no such thing as a right or wrong decision, and maybe you're not always going to make everyone happy, but the point is you bit down and made the call in the first place - and you have to trust your self and your own reasoning behind making that call, no matter how bad the others make you feel with their point of view.

Episode 3 demonstrates the peak of storytelling (that alone makes it an absolute must play), and the final episode is generally excellent, with the potential that your decisions may actually shape what happens in the upcoming Season 3.It's a shame that the penultimate episode just wasn't very good, with its uninteresting scenarios and dull character development. So 4 out of 5 episodes were at least great.8/10 - Recommended .Essential for Season 1 fans."
,Recommended,261030,13384326,"Posted: 15 December, 2014",all,Halflight,"The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a sequel to the original game by Telltale Games based from the comic book series of the same name. This time around you follow one of the first season's protagonists, the young girl Clementine, as she tries to survive the zombie apocalypse all by herself. As with the first, even the second season is divided in five episodes.The game will ask you for a first season save file. The decision you made in the original title will alter some moments across the episodes and nothing more. The decisions during the DLC 400 Days can also be imported, but sadly they count very little save for some cameos. If you don't import any save file, the game will create a previous story for you.Speaking of gameplay and general design, there is no much to say about this season other than the main formula of the series (and of Telltale titles in general) is followed to the letter even here. Compared to the first, the second season spots a more polished interface and button prompts. The characters' shading is also generally better and the animations more fluid and varied.It's worth mentioning however that the second season of the Walking Dead is more straightforward and action-oriented than the first one: while the latter was able to shift between tense moments and good chunks of the gameplay dedicated to exploration, problems solving and NPCs interaction, the former is more like an endless sequence of actions and tasks, with little time devolved to elaborate puzzles or lenghty discussions between characters.The general setting of the second season is also, if possible, even darker and edgier than the original game, making the players face increasingly desperate situations on a good basis and basically setting up the worst possible outcome most of the time regardless of the player's choices. While the direction the story is taking could as well be commended, at a certain point becomes really difficult to care about the characters' fates anymore or what one should choose next.The Walking Dead: Season 2 provides nevertheless a quality in gameplay and story telling that remains on par with the first season and has its fair share of emotional moments for all to share"

In season two Clementine's no longer a little scarred girl one has to keep an eye on at all times. This time, even though it's only months later, she's been through so much and seen more than anyone should in one life time that she seems to be the only real voice of reason amongst all characters.

This game is a great follow up to 400 Days (which didnt have as much in it as Id think, but a bigger impact on Season 2 than the entire first half of season 1) this game has the nice graphic novel art style that the first season used and the decissions in this one were much more thoughtful, even the small ones that really didnt change anything other than someones opinion for a short amount of time. This story really blew my mind away when... well when you play it you'll know the part I'm talking about. Although I wish they had explained the beginning a little more than they did, it was almost as if the game was picking up with the slow story that Season 1 had and doing the oppisite, where it would skip days, weeks, months at a time and there would be sudden weather changes in bursts. The one part I really didn't like was the fact that (This was the spoiler I talked about in the beginning, SPOILER!!!!) you can't get rid of Kenny no matter how hard you try.. The entire last two episodes I was trying to forgive Kenny and keep him but he just kept ruinning things for the group, the final choice of the Season was the best though...

I got a solid eight hours out of it, less than the ten or so it took me to complete 1 but still comparable.The music is still great and so is the animation style.  Choices are difficult and having a timer on them creates the illusion of tension: you need to act and you need to act now.  It plays like 1.Unlike Season 1 the episode transitions are more jarring.  The story is much, much more linear this time around than it was in S1 and each episode effectively starts where the last one ended without missing a beat.  Additionally, each episode ends on a pretty strong cliffhanger giving it a very television feel, suiting the game well considering it's labeling system of episodes and seasons.  Because of this tightness between the episodes, however, I very early on began wondering why this was produced in an episodic format.  While the transitions work well to support that, the narrative does not.  Episodic gameplay does not seem necessary and perhaps even devalues the core experience of playing Season 2.  Oh, and at the end of each episode are unskippable credits.  Yeah, I could have crashed the game to get around that but come on.  I get that some people may not have worked on the same episodes but would it have been so hard to remove these, or at least add a skip function?Gameplay wise not much as changed.  There is much, much less walking around, exploring small areas and interacting with the environment/characters.  Instead you spend the majority of your play time in chat cutscenes.  In that regard S2 feels much less like a game than 1 but it also focuses on the strong points of 1 as opposed to the weak navigation and point and click puzzle solving.Discard any concerns you have for Clementine serving as the player character as she fits the role pretty damn perfectly and much better than Lee in many circumstances.  Making tough choices with her has a lot more weight as you're now working with much more of a blank slate, and that's the beauty of these games.  They're not about zombies, or the story or the characters: they're about you, your choices and the story you want to tell with the character you're making.  Trust me when I say Clem is a much better fit for that role than Lee ever was.As an aside, the plot of episode 1 is pretty weak.  It very much felt like I was being manipulated with cheap story elements to feel a certain way.  After a few chapters the game picks up but the very early parts are extremely weak.  As a whole the plot is fine though it did feel like it was just shuffling about and wasting opportunities at times, which summarizes my feelings for the game.  It was alright and a good form of entertainment but compared to the long strides that S1 took, s2 felt like it was just killing time while setting up a much better S3.Do I recommend it?  Sure.  It may have overall felt like a weaker game than Season 1 but that's not saying much.  It's still a good game."

76561197998815606,Recommended,261030,11820254,"Posted: 22 August, 2014",all,Max,"Well now that I finished all the available content (Up to season 2 episode 4), I have decided its time to write a very detailed review about what I can easly say became my favorite game series of all time.This review WILL contain minor spoilers (Major spoilers will contain a warning before they are written).I am going to review the series (Both games so far) assuming people reading this have already played the first game.Let's get started.This game is hard. Now when I say hard, I don't mean that it is overly complicated or difficult.... no this game is on a whole new level of ""hard"". The game does such an amazing job by playing with your emotions that you can't figure out if you are playing the game or it is playing you. I can't count how many times I found myself tearing up because of an event in the game.MINOR SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!Season 1:In the first game of the series you play as a man named lee, an american history teacher who was on his way to jail for commiting a murder. As the story progresses you are faced with choices, choices you would never wanted to make if it was really you... With each episode the choices become harder as you find yourself getting on the better side of some people in your group and on the worse side of others.But choices arn't the only thing you need to warry about, you have a little 8 year old girl to take care of, named Clementine.You find this little girl about 5 miniuts into the game alone and scared hiding in her tree house in the back yard of her home.The little girl was waiting for her parents to come home from thier vacation when dead started walking the streets.At first Clemntine (I will call her Clem from now on) doesn't really trust you but that soon changes when she understands that  you are the only one who hasn't given up on her.As the game progresses you get to know a lot of people, some better some worse but who is your real friend is up to you to decide. Trusting people will be hard but you have to do what is best for Clem.By the end of the game you (The player) realize that the story didn't revolve around some guy named Lee the game is really about an 8 (by that time 9) year old girl named Clementine. You get to see her grow up, you teach her the basics of survival just to make sure she can live. You also get to see what a post apocalptic world does to a little Innocent girl as she turns from just some first grader you need to take care of to something better and stronger than any adult.MAJOR SPOILERS ABOUT SEASON 1 BEYOND THIS POINT!Season 2:In this installment you play as Clementine and you instantly see the change in her. She is no longer that innocent little girl you saw in the first game, she is now colder, smarter, stronger. The harsh post apocaliptic wasteland turn a sweat little girl into something else, something that might seem scary at first but as you go along the story, you understand that those changers are necessary for survival.Along the story Clem mentions Lee a few times and I couldn't just sit there. Every time she mentioned him I had to grab a tissue.Not all tears in this game are tears of sadness. At one part of the game, Clem is just the type of person that can sometimes bring tears of joy to your eyes even when things seem grim, there is always a moment of happynes.In conclution:This is a game for people who want a story. There is almost no gameplay involved but trust me, if the story seems even a little interesting it is well worth your money.This game is not for the weak of heart since it has a way of getting to you. (I rarely cry even in very sad movies but this game just got to me and I was crying like a little girl).This game might not have amazing graphics but it is not important, this game really is something special. Its a clear example of what's inside is what matters.This game is best played alone (since choices of people may very).10/10 WOULD AND WILL PLAY AGAIN"

You do? Tough luck. There are no such choices. Keeping it spoiler free - all choices are good and bad, right and wrong. And after seeing once choice statistic being at 50% it just goes to show - you just never know. The game teaches you that at every corner. And if you do not get attached to any characters then you were playing the game wrong. I barely ever cry and this game almost brought me to tears (both season 1 and 2).So... You can also test your manlyness - you will either cry, or you will shed some tears. Or you will do neither, go ""Meh"" and will be forever rememberd as an inhuman ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"

And non-combat operations, particularly the ones that are RMB + cursor, didn't have any sense of difficulty. Every so often, the game essentially pauses for you to perform some trivial action.It's kinda like the Telltale devs were given nice artwork, a good story, and decent dialog choices. Plugging the artwork, story and dialog together could be described as competent, but the gameplay related to non-combat operations was entirely lacking. The devs did not appear to understand how to implement fun gameplay elements.Walking Dead fans will enjoy the story, but it will be quite apparent how linear the game is. It's somewhat a disappointment that Telltale is able to sell an incomplete game on the strength of a story that was provided to them. Lazy."

The comic book art style gives it a graphic novel feel, like the what the series is based on.  There is a neat feature at the end of each episode which compares the choices you made with everyone else who has played it.  Looking forward to season 3."

This game certainly has it's ups and downs, so i'll place them below.PROS-Interesting, compelling storyline-Slight graphical improvements compared to the first game-Reoccuring season 1 characters still have the same voice actors-Your actions from season 1 affect season 2CONS-Episodes are only 90 minutes long, compared to the almost two hours of each episode of season 1-Several characters die unsatisfying deaths, used only for shock. Some you barely get to know before they're dead.-The game seems to focus more on action than storytelling at certain points-This game created ClukeOverall, this game is still a really good one.

You are put into dramatic situations (like two people going to die and you can save just one), and you have to choose very quickly. If you think about your choices through the story, you will learn a lot about yourself.It is a sequel, you should start with the first game before going into Season 2."

The decisions you made previously and on the 400 Days dlc will affect the story. The structure of the game is similar to the previous one, but with a more modern UI and slightly better graphics, while retaining the comic book graphical style.While I feel the episodes are a little bit shorter, it's still a matter of quality over quantity as the story is very engaging, with some decisions having a big impact in it. If you liked the previously season you should definitely get The Walking Dead: Season 2!"
,Recommended,261030,12494087,"Posted: 14 October, 2014",all,SetsunaOne,"I just finished this game after 9 hours full of exitement, hesitation and regrets and I still feel a little struck about how things turned out to be in the last episode.The positive about The Walkind Dead is that the Story-based system is nothing like I've ever played before. Even though you do not much in this game than smashing buttons, move forward, move left, move right or make conversation it never gets boring. The story is amazingly stunning, espacially if you are watching the samenamed TV series.The game isn't about showing your shooting skills, but about making desicions about trusting people, helping them and keeping care of yourself. The characters are all individual and interesting designed, some more sympathic than others, but with the happenings people's behavior will change in the game.You are able to make like 15% of the game's plot based on your desicion, e.g. you choose from two people who will you help surviving. That doesn't sound that much, but it's alright- to be honest, it was enough burden for me to burry ;) The music fits the atmosphere just fine and the system that shows you how often people made the same desicions as you did is a nice feature too.To name the bad aspects as well I have to admit that you really have to like the graphic style. It is kind of comic based and I really had to get used to it, but in the end I am glad it looked like this (some brutal scenes might have scared me a lot more if it had been a more realistic graphic).The game isn't that cheap for what it offers, but I bought it while it was on sale and I'd totally do again.At the end of every episode there are credits that can't be interrupted. This might be annoying if it wasn't for the beautiful, sad music that made you think about what happend in the episode.All in all I totally recommend this game for anyone who is into story-based games, the TV series, comic style graphics or anyone who just wants to test his ethical oppinions. Enjoy!"

Namely the exploration of the human evils rampant throughout the series. Though certainly a strong character, Clementime, for me personally, never quite lives up to Lee Everett and that strong relationship so prevalent throughout the first season far exceeds any character relationships in season 2. Still, however, I strongly recommend it for fans of the show, comic, or the previous game series. I can honestly say this game had more pressured moments that made me physically uncomfortable than most everyother game I've ever played. All in all, 9/10"

Is one person worth risking your own life, or two lives, or three lives? At what point is a single person no longer worth the sacrifice of many? It's something she'll be forced to decide on as she uses everything taught to her, by Lee, by Christa, and by several others, in order to survive both the Walkers and social challenges. The Season 2 climax is hit or miss; you either love it or hate it. Personally, I loved it, and found it to be arguably the hardest choice in the series."

The gameplay--answering questions based on the morality you want her to have, plus some QTEs--remains the same.  There is some gameplay polish in terms of how you interact with objects, which is a nice touch.Unfortunately, this season's storytelling arc suffers from a lack of focus.  Clemintine's decisions seem to get lost in the bickering of the--often hilariously incompetent or psychotic--adults around her.  The decisions you make in trying to keep the group together don't matter like they did in the first game, either.Overall, it's a dip from the first season's narrative strengths, but a decent enough game to pick up on sale.7/10"

The gameplay makes it feel like a movie yet the consequences of your actions and the things you cant control make the narrative much more powerful. These games are extremely immersive, if only because your investment into the relationships you build (which is 90% of the game) makes the attachement and inevetable seperation have much more depth.Im inclined to praise the first game over the second, only because it was easier to immerse myself as a middle aged black man then an 11 year old girl. You play as Lee in season 1, while you play as Clementine in the 2nd. Im glad they kept clementine around as she is in the first game, that alone carried over the investment you created in the first season.These games are extremely impressive, extremely emotional and artistically beautiful. Some moments you connect with characters, and it makes a lasting impression on you. Some of the more horrowing events do the same.I hope anyone who picks these games up feels as deeply as I do about them."

I mean it. The Walking Dead: Season 2 is essentially a simulator for kicking♥♥♥♥♥ and putting fools in their place.Anyhow, I don't really need to go into the mechanics. You all played Season 1. If not, you've at least played a Telltale Games adventure before. If not, then welcome to video games.Picking up not too long after Season 1, Clementine along with Christa and Omid make a pit-stop and -- surprise, surprise -- things don't go well. This is a theme in The Walking Dead, be it the comics, game, or TV show. If something good happens, two awful things will happen. If a character smiles, they'll be killed or eaten before you know it. This uncertainty shines in Season 2 -- in a way, moreso than in the first game. I'll get back to that in a moment.Compared to Season 1, I didn't feel as much tension. I think the set pieces were more open, and the threat of humans and zombies -- particularly in the final two episodes -- seemed less than the original game. Also, despite the fractured state of the group in S1, we still felt like a group. These people were only a group in that they were clustered together, and I spent so much time telling them to shut up and work together, that I pretty much only cared for (not cared about -- there's a distinction) two characters by the end. Aside from Clem, of course. Toss in the fact that at any point, someone was going to disappear, and it seemed like even Telltale didn't want us to become too attached to folks.To put it clearer, I didn't like the secondary and tertiary characters as much as S1, and the same goes for the setting, pacing, and plot, and -- as mentioned above -- set pieces.So, I didn't like S2, right? Wrong.This was still an enjoyable game, with interesting characters, compelling choices and action, and -- at times -- very good writing. Sure, it didn't captivate me like S1 or even The Wolf Among Us, but that's a knock against nearly every adventure game on the market.I wholeheartedly recommend this game, and hope that you either find the same enjoyment as I did, or even more. Happy gaming!"
,Recommended,261030,21132970,"Posted: 11 February, 2016",all,✪「fipk」 パニック,"The Walking Dead: Season 2.  Awesome game.  Awesome series.The game can run off your Season 1 save file and ""read"" what your choices were in the other game.  If you don't have the save file, it'll just make a random game for you to go off from.  Just like any Telltale game, the story is amazing and the story develops according to what choices you make/do.I can go on about the positives about the game but they've been covered by the other reviewers so I'm going to just quickly tell about the problems I had with this instead.  Don't get me wrong, I like the game but just because I like it doesn't mean it has some faults with it.  First off, the""problems"" that I'm going to picking on are mostly from the change from the first season to this season so bear that in mind.To interact with something that has multiple choices, you can either click on the option itself or click and drag into the direction the option is in.  Sometimes it doesn't register what I want to do and makes Clementine just walk and do nothing (using both ways of selecting an option).  In other scenes where you're suppose to press one of the WASD keys to avoid death.  The game will only register the key right after you can move.  So when the games tells you to press, you can't press it immediately.  I had to tap the key they tell me until I see Clementine move because it wouldn't register.There are also scenes where you have to click in the direction they're telling you to move in order to avoid death but I swear to god that I can not see them until it's too late.  It could be because I'm colorblind (red/green) but I don't know, I feel like they should've made the color white instead of red.  Blends in too well imo.The choices that you're given and the time given to select an option seems a bit too fast. (May not be for you!) Like I skim over the options and as soon as I finish skimming I have 1 second to move my mouse and choose.  Another 2 seconds or so in my opinion would be very helpful.  By the end of the game, I saw myself pressing the spacebar to pause and read the options to have unlimited time.edit; typos and grammar"

There is no one branching point for all the decisions for the endings like in ME3, but instead other choices branch, and then branch again.Also, other events that you forgot about in Season 1 or 2, deeming them inconsequential, make their appearance later on, proving that almost no choice is without consequences."

This was intense all the way to the end. And don't underestimate Clementine, she's one badass little girl.Episode 1 introduces a lot of new characters, which you'll get to know better later. I give it 10/10.Episode 2You start off right where you left in episode 1 and then you take it from there. Tell tale are still ceeping you on the edge of your seat.In episode 2 you get to know the characters some more and without spoiling too much, you get to meet some familiar ones too. I give it 9/10, cause it's dramatic as ♥♥♥♥.Episode 3Now, this was an interesting one. Episode 3 brings back the characters from twd: 400 days (even though, we don't get to see them alot), but it does introduce some new characters.Lastly it felt to me that your actions had more to say in this episode. Like what you did actoually matters (unlike some previous episodes).So I would give it a 7.5/10 as it doesn't do too much for the story, but it does set up for episode 4.Episode 4Episode 4 starts just where you left in ep 3 and has you continue from there. Now, episode 4 is all about arguing. You try to please evryone, but it's a♥♥♥♥♥♥world, and no matter what you do, someone's going to get hurt.I give it 8/10 as it gives you a lot of choises (more than previously).Episode 5So I just played through ep 5....

Winter's coming, you're low on food and meds, you have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥russians with guns, a crew that's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at each other and you have a baby on your hands, what do you do?Episode 5 continues the right where episode 4 ended and let's you go from there. There are lot's of stuf happening here and Clementine has a moment (which I expected).*I have only played through it once, so I have not experienced all the endings*The end is as dramatic as you get it. There's a massive ♥♥♥♥♥torm, and you're in the middle of it. The ending I had was heartbreaking. I shed several man tears and my face looked like the face you get the first time you're shot with a needle. The ending is all up to you. As far as I know, there is not an ending such as in twd s1, where you can wait it out and see what your clementin does. Or it might be, I'm not sure about that, but I am sure that the ending is gonna be sad, no matter what your choises are.Episode 5 gets 10/10, It's everything that I wanted and it made me cry (and I thaught I was all out of feels).So as a summary, The walking dead season 2 was a great secual in my opinion, and gets a 9/10.

But there are still copious chances for the player to have Clementine give verbal input (albeit with questionable importance and influence).The story is still pretty decent, even if some elements can be frustrating (i.e: the aforementioned watch-over-play feel), and a few stupid shenanigans started by the supporting cast, but all in all, if The Walking Dead Game was your cup of tea, this one is worth giving a shot.

You play Clementine this time and go through what would seem as a ""what would Lee do"" at times, but of course Clementines has her own character.After finishing chapter 5, I could not help but feel terrible of the choices I made, notiably the last couple before the credits rolled. Never have I felt more uncomfortable making a tough choice over close to 30 years of gaming. Telltale truly delivered in bringing me the dark world of The Walking Dead.The one thing that I do noticed which felt like a downgrade for season 2 was the fact that it felt less intereactive and adventurous compared to the diversity of the 1st season. Not only did I feel that the first 3 episodes went by quickly, but at times felt like there could of been more to it. Perhaps this was done to help with pacing and have the player feel more engaged.Overall, The Walking Dead Season 2 is A MUST play for those who enjoyed Season 1. For those who haven't so and are interested, play both seasons as that is the way its meant to be played, you will not regret it, except perhaps some of the choices you'll make in game."

The second time I took the opossite choices each time and I have to say that not much has changed. So, as in the first season, choices don't alter the events very much. But there are few that do alter some stuff, nothing important at the end though. The only real important choices to take, are the last two. They define the multiple endings this game can have.The game is more about dialogue and choices than point&click action, there's not much ""exploring"" in it. It feels closer to watching a movie than playing the first season.**SPOILER ALERT**About the characters.Of course that everybody who played season one must love Clem.Carver is interesting to me, as it shows what Kenny would become given enough time. Jane also mentioned it.Kenny is a man hard to like, he was quite unbearable in the first season and he's not very different now. But I'm glad I didn't kill him.

Alright.. that was awful.Let's get started!So, i came in ''touch'' with The Walking Dead (s1) and i was like, WOW that Game is frking amazing! but... yeah.. i bought it with the DLC wich means i was so late that all episodes were published and i didn't need to wait!The Main game was super awesome, it was full of emoticon (from my side) i was like, Happy,Angry,Scared and much more so yeah it is an intense game with a Great story i never played a better game before.....until the 14th of December 2013 knocked on my Steam account... The Walking Dead: Season 2 with around 15% Price reduction...Gaben knew he would bring me to pre-order it instant.. i did..in the same week i played s1 again, just to ..  refresh my mind a bit.Date: 17th of DecemberToday was the Offical release of TWD S2 and i woke up with a boner jumped on my chair, started the PC and started the game. BOOM the Menu design, Theme and style was .. special. i can't describe what i felt but it was awesome. i looked at S1 and thought okay.. S1 was awesome but it could've been better... but hey! it's a COMIC STYLE GAME and i love those ''Point and Click'' games!Whatever.After starting the first chapter i was like WOW You're there were you ended the story of s1 *AWESOMEEEEE*!But... After completing the first Episode... i was sad... sad about not beeing able to play it for two month...After Episode 2 released you see the people from the DLC 400 Days (from S1) which is super cool because... Duh? DLC Content from the 1st game in the 2nd game? ... the game just saves all your decisions and bring them back later to you.Result:+ The Game is worth buying if you like Comic-Styled Point and click games with decisions which will come back at you later in the game.+ If you do something wrong that you will regret in the end the game will punch you in the face with that choice so you know .. you made a mistake and have to live with that.+ EMOTIONS!

Beyond the first chapter, the game is TERRIBLY predictable and unentertaining. When you can't predict what is going to happen, it's because a character has made a clearly stupid mistake, and you have to either kill somebody or watch someone get killed. Not saying this wasn't true for the first season, but I have zero emotional investment in any of the characters in this season.""Oh but what about CLEM and KENNY!?"" *semi spoiler alerts ahead!* Let me start with Kenny. He keeps on with his tough demeanor, but keeps having that special someone in his life that will eventually become brutally murdered. After he goes through his usual gun-toting tantrum, he becomes a psychopathic, gun-toting sissy who decides the smartest thing to do now is care for a helpless crying baby in this zombie apocolypse where he couldn't even protect two wives and a son that, honestly, lived longer than I expected during my play through in season 1. Sorry Duck, you're freaking zombie fodder. In the end, I'm tired of Kenny, and was hoping that Clem would have actually been able to keep him sane. This is where I'll move on to my rant on Clem...Clem is a little girl. SHOCKER, I know, but without a protector in the first season, she would have died quickly. It was expected that she would be useless for anything beyond sneaking through tight spaces in the first season, but in season 2, after she's gone through all the crap she did, I figured she would be a LOT more hardened and a LOT more tough. After she gets her 2 protectors murdered, she wanders into the forest and thinks it would be smart to play with a starving, wild dog. After she gets torn to shreds, and then thrown into a shed by strangers where she almost gets eaten by a zombie, I figured she would have been like ""People and dogs suck"" and after getting sewn up by the strangers and fed, she would have then been like ""Duces"". But NO. She sticks around with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters and gets into even more trouble. I wanted to be a total d-bag to everyone, but the game wouldn't let me.I hated every character in this game. That pregnant black chick was the worst of them all, and I didn't have an ounce of sympathy for her the entire game, even through the game kept trying to cram it down my throat. Oh she's tough. Oh no her husband got murdered right in front of her. Oh yay she's having a baby. Oh no she's dying. Oh YES I shot her in the zombie face.  If she hadn't banged the main antagonist (who is clearly the father of this baby, but nobody talks about it) then none of this crap would have happened to all these people I don't care about at all. I tried my best to play protector on Duck 2.0 (Sarah), but in the end, I left her sitting in a mobile home to get eaten by zombies. You can't baby someone that much, and Clem never pulled that crap on Lee.This game wreeked too much of ""Care about this empty character"" and ""Watch bad mistakes be made every 5 minutes"". I didn't even finish the last chapter, and I don't think I will, because it reminds me too much of the experience I had with watching the movie Zombeavers. Seriously, try to watch that movie in it's entirety, and if you can do that, tell me you aren't sad about the time you wasted. I never did finish the movie either, and even the most dramatic comeback couldn't have saved face. HARD PASS."

It's as though the developers has taken in all the feedback and improved the previous gameplay mechanics and story[telling].There are many more choices to be made and the game feels less straight-forward when it comes to decision making, changing a lot of the black and white decisions into a grey area; where there is no right or wrong, only what you feel you should do at the time. There's the ability to manipulate people through blackmail, or appealing to their humanity; or to completely ignore all contact and ""go it yourself."" Instead of interacting between one or two characters, or just simply finding about their backstory through dialogue, Clementine is able to eavesdrop on conversation to get an idea of what's going on, whilst also having the option to interact between half a dozen or so characters at once. Who you manipulate, help, ignore, the others will react. This part is the most interesting aspect of the game, as your options of who to interact with has been broadened in this season when compared to season 1.Clementine is the main character this time around and she has grown quite a lot since season 1. Her experiences in season 1 remains with her throughout season 2, and you'll notice that through the dialogue and reasoning behind some of the choices she makes. She's a tougher, colder and less empathetic on the outside, but through some dialogue you can still see some of the purity that's left within her.On top of the 'mash Q to do something' and 'click this zombie before it bites you' mechanic, the game has also introduced a quick time event where you'll press up, down, left, right, true to on screen prompts, in order to dodge and maneuver around during a quick-time sequence. It's quite fun and fast paced and really improves the flow of the game.A definite thumbs up; the only negative aspect of this game is the long agonising wait between episodes."

I'm not sure if there's another developer out there on such a hot streak right now.In season two the player controls Clementine. At first I wasn't sure if this was a good idea. My interactions with her were the best parts of season one, especially seeing how she reacted to and learned from my decisions, and I was worried that her personality might be spoiled. However, I quickly found that it presented an interesting roleplaying opportunity that influenced the way I interacted with other characters. Being younger means not having a leadership role, and trying to be more persuasive rather than just taking charge. Meanwhile being physically weaker meant I had more respect for the bad guys' strength, and situations where I might have just attacked immediately in season one as Lee, I found myself being a lot more cautious.Along the way you'll meet lots of new characters as well as a couple of familiar faces. The dialogue is well written and voice acting is excellent. You'll encounter various threats from both the living and the dead, which result in some very tough choices. Most scenarios don't have an obvious best answer, and many consequences are unpredictable. You're just trying to do whatever it takes to keep everyone alive as you stumble from one bad situation to the next.The core gameplay mechanics remain intact. Most of the time you'll be making dialogue choices, many of which will influence the story in some way. Compared to season one there are less sections where you need to walk around and find objects to solve puzzles. I think this is probably the main reason why the episodes are shorter. I finished season 2 in 8 hours compared to 11 hours for season 1. Combat sections are again controlled by QTEs but they are relatively painless. I think there was only one section where I died multiple times. I didn't experience any bugs or crashes.My only real disappointment is the lack of effect carried through from my season one choices. There was a line of dialogue here and there, but nothing really significant.I highly recommend playing the Walking Dead. If you enjoyed season one, there is no reason to think you would be disappointed by season two."

There is replay value if you want to see what happens if you picked a different choice.The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a great game. I recommend while it's on sale.The best reduction for the game as of making this review is 75% off."

,Recommended,261030,12121722,"Posted: 16 September, 2014",all,Malsey,"Without Story Spoilers:There was a LOT about this game that I absolutely loved, I loved most of the new characters and became quickly attached to the big rapidly changing dysfunctional family that always follows apocalypse survivors.  Some of the choices felt really meaningful and hard to make (Though I did rewind some of them just to see if I could change something and most of the things I changed couldn't have been changed, which kind of frustrated me, [but hey, I understand that's a ton of work for everyone to add certain changes] but I still went with it, living from the character's view, because that's what you have to do).  Also, specific things, in early chapter two, which I wont say, but, heh.  I can list a lot of things that really stood out about this game...But... There were a lot of things in this game that really made me kind of annoyed or angry or frustrated.  First off, I kind of wanted a little more of the 400 days characters, I just felt they weren't important enough.  I mean, I got pretty attached to a couple of them throughout 400 days, and was sort of upset to find out how minor their parts were (Though I only did one playthrough, so I might have just missed something, but I doubt I did because of what I think their reasons are) and how plain and flat most of them were (again, in my playthrough) so it really seemed like they didnt even want to have them, that they were just, sort of there.  I know why they did that and all the other reasons, though, and to avoid spoiling anything, I won't say it here.While everyone I know loved it, the ending of this game disappointed me so much that I just didn't care about it, (It was ""Lost"" to me [Hey look a pun, because the ending was super disappointing, just like Lost, kek]) and I tried to remove it from memory.  Everything from the start to the finish building up to the last scene was incredible, but the very end, it just shattered everything for me, and not in an emotional way, in an ""Are you serious right now"" kind of way.As much as I hated the ending, I did really enjoy playing through it, almost everything up until that last scene was great, so I do recommend it.  Though I would suggest not getting your hopes up for a grand finale, I mean, the choices you have to make near the end do take a lot of thought, more than the ending of the first one, for sure, but I didnt feel as emotionally connected.Did I leave satisfied: NoDid I leave happy that I had experienced this game: YesDid I enjoy playing the game: YesSo there.SPOILERS AHEAD:     D:I was REALLY disappointed with the fact that I wasn't able to leave with Bonnie, Arvo and Mike in the end (Bonnie survived the ice for me).  That was what I wanted, I like both of them more than Jane or Kenneth, and I don't care about the baby.  I don't like babies.  I loved Bonnie and Mike and spent most of the game worrying about when they would die, because I wanted to end with them.  When they didnt die by what I guessed was the last big challenge, I was so happy.  And then I couldn't go with them in the end anyway, that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off...  Oh, also watching Ken beat a man's eyes out with a crowbar was really satisfying"

Overall, this sequel is weaker because the flow of the game/narrative is mostly the same even though you're playing with a kid. More specifically (spoiler alert):Personally, I felt that that most of the cast treats Clementine like sh * t, so I was just happy to see them go and to even help them on their way. With not much emotional investment nor any difficulty making choices, I decided what I wanted to do by the end of the second episode: punish these folks that couldn't even spare a glass of water for a dying child. It was fun getting it done, but a bit boring, since the game kept trying to pull on heart strings that simply weren't there.Just another small note: the Walking Dead persists on going after the protagonist for things he/she didn't do. My Lee didn't take the food from the van of that family. My Clem didn't steal the meds from Arvo. The game still says ""Aha! Thief!""*groan*"

That said, if you've played season 1 then that no doubt doesn't really come as a surprise and if you haven't.... then why the hell not?There are some minor negatives off course, mainly that some of the characters in this season are a bit more bland then the ones in season 1.Also everybody follow and obeying a little kid during the entire story is perhaps logically speaking not really all that realisitc, no matter how baddass that kid might be at times.Lastly, if you're not a fan of quicktime events stay far far away.... but then if you do, why are you even looking at a telltale games game in the first place?Pro's and con's+ Great story+ Plenty of emotional moments+ Clementine+ A good amount of different endings depending on your choices+ Cellshaded graphics- A few really bland characters- A bit too short for my likingOverall Score9/10"

I am unable to find a word to summarise the experience I've had with this game.Perhaps, combined with Season One, one of the most harrowing emotional roller-coaster rides & engaging game experiences I've had in my lifetime.The Walking Dead: Season One was a defining title for Telltale Games, bringing forth not only their well-known respect for licensed properties via Point & Click Adventure Games as they've done in the past such as Sam & Max and Back to the Future, but a choice mechanic that outdoes all before it, providing players up to four choices of dialogue or decisions on a timer with the additional option to remain silent or do nothing. Coupled with purely outstanding storytelling & characters, this created a uniquely engaging player-interactive experience.So what's different about Season Two? Apart from the new story it tells & characters you meet, not a lot. Season Two does what Season One did all over again, at least for me; tell a deeply engaging story with outstanding characters, throwing you tough choices to make at many turns. But what has changed this around I can state:- The UI has been iterated upon, now making choices & on-screen prompts mouse-cursor driven, and Quicktime Events more precise.- I seemed to notice a somewhat reduced amount of puzzle-solving compared to Season One. Perhaps not in quantity, but it did seem Telltale Games did take note from the feedback regarding certain puzzle-solving sections from Season One that feedback claimed halted the pace of the game. Maybe the puzzle-solving in Season Two could be better described as more streamlined.- Quicktime Events have received quite some improvement from Season One, most particularly with moments where you're required to use a weapon are most often much more precise, most commonly with guns, demanding much higher accuracy from the player & really increasing the tension.- Some certain areas that I must leave for you to find out for yourselves.All in all, this ""Choice & Click Adventure"" Game is a game I would recommend to anyone & everyone of a mature age looking for a story, for this highly player-interactive story is one of the finest I know."

But it doesn't have the same 'feeling' somehow.Well then...If you love immersive story based RPG's then you will love The Walking dead season 1...And season 2.Season one is the absolute pinnacle (So far out of three seasons) for me, it has a fantastic balance of everything you want in this type of game.In Season 2 the focus of the story switches a little more towards a 'Survival against the elements' and bad guys rather than being mainly focused on the Walkers. This is fine, the story still flows nicely and you will still feel emotional connections with characters.As in Season 1 you will feel happiness, empathy, sadness, surprise and much more. There are some very surprising moments and the characters (All of them) are drawn and created very well. Their personalities are all individual and unique.For me, Season 1 edges it as the 'Original and best' and I can't quite put my finger on why. The only possible thing I can think of is that there's a 'Beginning' to the story of Season 1...Season two obviously 'Continues' rather than 'Introduces' you to the game. Very hard to choose a fave, they are both fantastic.YouTube WalkthroughI have created a full and complete playlist of Seasons one, two and three on YouTube.

,Recommended,261030,34424512,Posted: 22 August,all,Spoopy Egg,Season 2 probably is my favourite season out of the 3 (Not including Michonne). Playing as a character that was admired in the first season was already a seller for me. You never really see a character like Clem be so reliable and strong. Not to mention (again) in the first season she was so loveable already. The characters really loved Clem and takes kind of a different story from the first but still keeps it really compact and you are able to understand everything.

It's a fun game. It really is.But I have never hated a set of writers more. I have never been so insanely angry at game creators for any reason at all.

Yes.The game overall is unchanged, presumably with the mindset of “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”, and I can’t say that I mind. The gameplay is nothing amazing, but the choices, dialogue, and above all, characters are where the game truly shines. Once again, there is constant tension, as no location is never truly safe, only safer.In this installment, the scope is bigger, but the game loses a small amount of focus on some of the little details that made season one great. Definitely play season one before this, for a number of reasons.Problems aside, the game knows where and when to step it up, and the development the main four or so characters go through is terrific. There are five possible endings, and I could make a legitimate case for all of them being equally valid and consistent with the characters.This was a terrific follow up to an amazing game, and I can’t wait for season three."
76561198347852275,Recommended,261030,29103412,Posted: 7 January,all,KamKam,"So, I never thought I would write a review about this game, but I just have to after what I read from others...This game really took me by surprise. I came out of Season One thinking that there will never be a better one. And I was right... to a point.The game starts off soon after the ending of the first one. You are put into the shoes of Clementine, who is definitely a familiar character to anyone who played season one. This time you get to see what it's like to see the apocalypse from the eyes of an eleven year old girl. Telltale doesn't hesitate, and shows you its reality in the first ten minutes of the first episode. The mechanics of the game are also greatly improved giving the player an easier way to pick dialogue by finally giving us a mouse. This allows us to have more control and not accidentally pick the wrong answer like I did a couple of times in season one.The gameplay itself gets a lot more interactive and it isn't all about point and click anymore. There is a lot of mouse control and keyboard play but of course not a crazy whole amount because we have to remember; this is a story rich game which mainly includes dialogue.Just like Lee, Clementine is a character that we see change and develop through the game. Reactions and characteristics that make Clementine a character are always there, but clementine can be changed quite a lot. There are many moral choices you make that only have an affect on you in the end. Like choosing whether Clementine should smoke a cigarette or drink some alcohol. these choices won't affect the game, but it will make Clementine different in YOUR eyes.When it comes to other characters, I was once again taken by surprise at how much I cared about some of them, whereas at the same time, I absolutely hated other characters. There was a certain character that I hated in the beginning, but as I went through the game, my opinion changed. It was a pleasant change as Season One never really did. Sure there were times I thought a character I liked did the wrong thing, But I never changed opinions completely like I did here.As for the game's length, It was good. Exactly 10 hours to wrap the game up which is a bit longer than I should have finished, but I was delayed due to some very hard decisions, which I regretted straight away. Yes, I know it's basically cheating to go back and change my choices but I re-winded just a couple seconds after the picking my choice, mostly because I felt differently straight after I chose the answer. Take that however you want.The ending of the game, once again came to me as a big surprise. To a point where I had to close my eyes after choosing what to do. Then I just sat in my chair and stared at the screen waiting to see the heart-breaking consequences.Overall, The Walking Dead Season Two is a masterpiece. Its story meets the level of the first season and it did not leave me disappointed. If anything, it left me empty... As if my life was over. And it made me want more, exactly like Season One did. So in the end... Season Two was not better than Season One, if that's what your looking for, then unfortuneatly you're doomed to replay season one again and again because you will never get such a good story with such great characters. But Season Two definitely meets the level of its predecessor. Especially with how it concludes. Like it or not but no matter what your choices are through Season One, in the end you get the same ending. Whereas here, your choices take a big part when it comes to the end of the game. So like I did, choose wisely. Even if you need to rewind. As long as it doesn't ruin the game for you.The Walking Dead Season 2 is definitely one of the best games I ever played and I would recommend it to anyone who completed the first one.- 10/10"

And thats a good thing. It's a fitting continuation for Season 1. That being said it feels a lot more transitional than a story of its own right, a bridge between S1 and whatever comes next.Also it was very weird for me to play as an 11 year old girl."

Also, I actually played this more nonstop than the first, so I was more focused on it. At the very bottom of the review is a SPOILER ALERT, so be wary.I loved Season 2 more than the first Walking Dead Telltale game. Why? It felt much more emotional than the first, and there were way more quick-time events to keep me involved in the action as well as the storytelling. The biggest strongpoint of the first game was what happened at the end; in Season 2, that crap's happening a lot more often constantly. The characters weren't so much cookie cutter in this one as they were in the first: There were characters I started off despising, hoping they'd either get offed, or that Clementine would put them in their place, but I grew to understand them and care for them because the zombie apocalypse makes people do crazy things.The only complaint I had was how the decisions the game made me make shook my inner being because I felt like a jerk regardless of the choices I made.To summarize how I felt about the game in short: I'm preordering Season 3 when I get the chance. I think I owe it to the devs to actually pay full price for one of these games, instead of being the cheapskate I am and waiting till they're 75% off just so I can get the best bang for my buck. The game's fantastic, and outdoes the first one in my opinion with its action sequences and storytelling.***SPOILER ALERT*** ***DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING OF THE GAME*** ***THIS IS YOUR OFFICIAL SPOILER WARNING***Why the hell did I and only 10% of players go with Jane at the end? I mean, did 90% of players just ignore what was going on the entire game only because Kenny is a beloved first game character? They showed repeatedly that he was done being rational, and was in fact dangerous despite Clem's attempts at showing he can still make it. Granted, I did not at all like Jane's way of handling the situation, but she was right in the end. Let's face it also: Clementine with her gained skills would still not survive on her own, so you kinda have to go with Jane because realistically Clementine would've been killed by walkers at some point since no one's watching her back; plus, the baby. An eleven year old girl is hard-pressed to survive in a zombie apocalypse on her own.And as a sidenote on the ending, I KNEW THAT GUY WAS BAD. The way his hand was rested on his lower back, I was thinkin to myself: ""I bet he's got a gun, ready to shoot us if we let him in."" MMMMMHHHHMMMM."

This game is a must buy for any fans of the original TellTale Walking Dead game and for anyone who enjoys games with decision making and storytelling. I would also recommend both seasons to anyone who yearns to get away from mainstream and at times mindless games that are constantly being pumped out by producers looking for a quick buck.Long story short. I would buy this game and be patient for the future episodes and see it as a well placed investment because at the moment I am not regreting it.P.S play the first game before you buy this one. as it will explain the story prior to season two (obviously) and does give you some control of some events in this one.

Excellent writing, great voice acting, and a wonderful character study on Clementine.  The lines of dialogue in this game is marvelous and it leaves an impact on the player.  The first episode alone packs a huge punch and manages to get the play emotionally very easily and very quickly.  The game alos looks a hell of a lot better than Season 1, and it takes the QTE and point and click interface/mechanics of The Wolf Among Us, something that I feel is a positive.  Also, unlike Season 1, I did not come across any technical probelms or bugs, the game ran incredibly smoothly for me.  The only cons I can think of is that this episode is kind of short, I beat it in about an hour and fifty minutes, when usually episodes from Season 1, as well as Episode 1 of Wolf Among Us, are about 2-3 hours long (excluding episode 5 of Season 1, which was about an hour and a half).  Another con would have to be that as of right now, most of the new characters aren't as interesting as Season 1 characters, although given that there are four more episodes to come, I think Telltale is just establishing them with this one.  A final con would have to be that while they give you hints at a overarching storyline in the Episode, I'm still unsure as to what the story will be, but again, it's only the first episode so I wouldn't knock too much off the game for this.  Overall, I'm incredibly happy with this game and cannot wait on the rest of the episodes as well as Wolf Among Us, now if only Telltale could give us solid release dates or at the very least a release window.  But in the end, I think it's worth your money and given the awesome cliffhanger, it is leaving me wanting more already."

Telltale has lifted the new control scheme from The Wolf Among Us.Similarly there are no puzzles as in Season 1, instead the tasks are more obvious, leading to a much greater focus on the story. I found the puzzles in the first Season generally got in the way of story progression, so their absence is welcomed.The voice acting is top notch much like the first season, although there are a few weaker cast members and the occasionally clunky line of dialogue. A strong start to the new season, but it's short, really short. About 90 mins at a relatively leisurely pace.

If you've spent a long time and invested a lot of time in clementine already with season 1 becoming her unseen guiding hand in season two just brings it in all that much closer. If you haven't, it does a good first act job of driving home the gravity of clem's situation.While the game is still largely one of ""click things to get to next cutscene"" a few more actiony bits that work like better versions of season 1's motel stealth sequence and some expanded QTEs with more variant options spice things up a litte, but it's still very much a of narrative and cutscene heavy presentation with just enough interaction to properly be called a game.That narrative and cutscene presentation, however, is superb, and I have every reason to believe that season two will be just as masterful as the first.Buy this now, and if you haven't bought season 1 buy it first."

,Recommended,261030,13646838,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,WoodsieLord,"I think this game's predecessor is one of the best, if not the best, storytelling/adventure games out there. Season 1 presents us with a blank slate of a flawed protagonist, and we can shape events along with character development, culminating in a good finale.In Season 2, Telltale saw it fit that you are just a little girl who simultaneously is incredibly mature but entirely inconsequential. Lee an amazing main character Season 1, and watching and interacting with Clementine was so rewarding that it covered all the other contrived and patchy shockers of the plot (like cannibals or psychopathic pedophiles). Her likability was the dominant taste left in your mouth. Winning her love and trust just melted your heart.However, playing as Clem is often unrewarding. All other characters around you are deeply irrational and mostly shallow. I understand living in the zombie apocalyse can be a little tense, but one would expect slightly more maturity and helluva lot more depressive traits from the now long-term survivors of this wasteland. Nope. Everyone is as mentally challenged as they come. NPCs are cookie-cut personalities with very little regard for other points of view. While playing a preadolescent girl, consistently being the most mature of all characters, no matter what dialog option is chosen, gets old fast. The grown-ups often treat you like the smartest, wisest, and most courageous of the group and consult you at all times before acting, only to turn around and not really listen to you at any key point.The story drifts aimlessly, plot holes exist, and at times (I'm guessing when you somehow manage to slightly deviate from the way Telltale saw fit to write the master arc), the flow staggers and scenes turn patchworky. This is somewhat expected in interactive storytelling, and it's OK when after long arcs all choices converge into one inevitable outcome. Those arcs are merely minutes long in Season 2.That brings us to the main flaw of TWD S2. The team got lazy. I don't know what is happening internally, if Telltale is spreading itself too thin with so many projects, but the game is nowhere nearly as fulfilling as some other, older Telltale titles. The characters are not developed, the plot hasn't found itself, most action scenes are contrived after Episode 1, the transitions are abrupt, and the overall flow is poorly executed in a way that makes all your previous choicess pointless. In short, a draft of a very good story.However, no matter how lazy, the groundwork TWD S2 is built upon is rock solid. The voice acting is moving, the world is bleak as ever, and the story is only as unrewarding as a bad season of an incredible series. It still needs to be experienced. It has moments of brilliance, like finding a dog, or the first conversation with Carver. It gets by belonging to a great franchise, and has the misfortune of being judged by the masterpiece that came before it. Play it, but let Telltale know that you expected better."

,Recommended,261030,8889125,"Posted: 28 January, 2014",all,Zyphon,"--The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 1: All That Remains Review--Telltale's The Walking Dead Season 2 is a fantastic game that continues off of the first Season, which was possibly the greatest story ever written, and definetly the best story in a video game that oyu will ever find. Seaosn 2, so far, seems to be the exact same, if not leading up to being better. It's starts off with a huge shocker, and from then on out, the intensity and suspense doesn't drop.Writting/Acting:+Characters: The characters, both new and old, are all fantastic. There are some who you will like and trust, and others that you will hate(not due to bad writting) right off the bat. It's just as good as the first Season in this regard, and does a great job introducing the new cast for this Season. Even after only one episode, you may get attached to some of the characters who helped oyu out in the beginning.+Story: The story itself has several twists and turns, and is phenominal as a whole. The whole point of The Walking Dead Franchise is to show stories about characters in difficult stiuations, and osme of the situations that oyu will encounter as Clementine are just absolutely gut-wrenching.+Dialouge(Acting): The dialouge is great, as always with a Walking Dead game. The acting form all of the characters is also fantastic, just like Season One, and just like The Wolf Among Us. There's nothing to complain about, and plenty to praise.Gameplay:+Improved UI: The UI seems to have been improved upon since last Season. Overall, it's more fluid, and there are more options in how things will be dispalyed. Another fix is are the actual choices, you no longer have to scroll through a bunch of options displayed in small font, now, whenever given a choice, several boces will appear on the screen that you just click on. Actions have also been improvee, using the same radial memu that appears when mousing over something from The Wolf Among Us.+Improved QTEs: My biggest problem with Season One were the lame QTEs. Basically, every QTE in that season was just ""Mash Q until the box fills up, then hit E"". This season takes the dodging and fighting QTEs from Wolf Among Us, making use of the arrow keys and the mouse. QTEs and Choices have also been integrated, just making things a little smoother.-Episode Length: My biggest, and really only problem with this Episode is that it's about half the length of a normal episode. On average, it takes about an hour and a half to finish, but if you're a little quicker, then it really only takes about an hour, the length of an episode from the TV Series. On top of the fact that the game was actually delayed once in October, and again in November, this isn't a good thing.Overall, this game is definetly worth and buying, and definetly worth your time if you're into story based Interactive adventures. However, if you're looking for something with a similar concept, but with more gameplay, then I'd point oyu in the direction of State of Decay."

,Recommended,261030,11878989,"Posted: 26 August, 2014",all,Dinerenblanc - Psych,"Would I recommend this game? Yes, but it's a reluctant yes. You see, there's a ton of things that Telltale does right, but there's also a ton of things that they do wrong. In an effort to eclipse the superb speciman that is season one, Telltale attempts to create a game where the player's choices have a more profound effect on the ending. In return, the story became overly manufactured. Many conflicts do not feel organic. The lack of a natural build up to these instances kept me from connecting to the characters. In the end, they all felt like plot devices that only existed to lead up to the inevitable choice of choosing between an old friend and a newcomer. This would be fine if the events leading up to the finale wasn't as contrived as the ending, which brings up another problem; the mishandling of pretty much every prominent character.A decent handful of the characters are introduced and cast off in a rather unceremonious matter. They're generally introduced to lend weight to a choice to be made by the player, but once tha choice is made, they're generally cast off with few things to do & say until their inevitable death after a humanizing moment. Those subtle moments that Telltale does so well are still there, but it has come to the point where players expect heavy baggage to attached to them. Little Jimmy is sharing a story with Clem about his childhood? Yeah, it's likely that something negative will happen to him soon after. It's just too formulaic. Suspense is what drives us to play TWD. It can't be built when things are so obvious. There are times when TWD shines, but at times it feels like amateur hour.I believe I do know the cause of these shortcomings though. The fact is that there's two different writers tackling different episodes within the season. It's tough to have a cohesive story with two different individuals picking up after one another. What might have worked for season one is not working anymore. Ultimately, I did enjoy season two, but I did not get the same sense of fulfillment this time around. In fact, I feel overwhelmingly empty."

It keeps the same tension and vivid storytelling as the first game, something many people will be glad to hear. However, it does not change anything in terms of gameplay or graphics. It looks and plays exactly the same as the first game. This does not hurt the game at all, however if you are expecting anything more than a continued story, you will be disappointed. That being said, please do not play this game if you never played the first game - it's completely pointless as this game is not better than the first (nor is it worse). You would gain nothing, and be completely lost as the story would make no sense.This is a short review, as this is an episodic game which has yet to be completed."

You play as Clementine who is now the main protagnist of the story, she goes throught harsh trails along the way but I got to tell you, she's a tough cookie. The game starts off with your previous choices that you made through season 1, also it also carries over your 400 Days DLC choices (If you hadn't bought it, it randomises your choices). I was on the edge of my seat pretty much the entire time, I have to admit there are some pretty tough decisions that you need to choose along the way. The UI is much more crispy than the last season and it guides you much easier this time.Can't wait for the next episode, but we all know its going to be next year :3The only thing I notice was that Episode 1, was way to short compared to season 1, it took me 30mins to finish this, usually its 45 mins +, who knows maybe I'm just playing to fast or telltale is just teasing us with shorter episodesA word of warning:[WARNING] - If you are horriable at point-and-click games, you will be seeing alot of gruesome deaths of a little girl[WARNING] - If you have a faint heart or any medical illnesses, its not recommend that you should play itWell, I don't think words are going to help you enjoy the game, its better if you experince it first-hand and don't forget.Enjoy the game :3Pros:+ great story line+ original voice actors from the first game (Christa, Omid, Clementine)+ suspense at every corner+ still loving the graphicsCons:- Episode 1 felt really short (finished it in 30mins)"

I seen almost all my story driven choices reversed almost immediately after I made them; this removed all illusions of choice/agency for me.I'm glad I continued the story but, due to the above issues, I didn't like it nearly as much as season 1."

They send a little girl to all the jobs they are too lazy/stupid to do themselves, they point how how stupid it is yet blame you (Clem) once it fails. The characters? They should all be wearing red shirts, with target signs on their foreheads because dying is the only thing they are good for. There's nothing you can do about it, but you can make a choice that will make you feel bad about that character's death, or really bad about that character's death. Your choice!! And when you do manage to save a character, they either become mute, or suddenly find a reason to disappear for a while until you find a their dead body somewhere because Telltale is too lazy to make said death significant or interesting.But the worst part is how devoid of subtlety this game is. The best way to figure out who is about to die is to count the number of lines they have. Yes, the characters who are about to die suddenly have the urge to spit out their entire backstory in an attempt to make you care about them. X has problems with his brother? Well, you will spend all of your time with said brother until he dies (rather quickly) You will then be constantly with X until he dies too! then X's best friend, Y, until he dies, rinse & repeat until entire group is dead.Rather than putting you with a small group and make you care about them on an individual level, they pick a larger one made up of jerks, and each of the ones you will get to know better will die in an attempt to make you feel something.My other problems with this game can be summed up in this list:- Conversations are now way shorter, therefore less interesting- The puzzles are gone- The episodes are way more linear, there aren't any choices with multiple outcomes, like the ""give out food"" choice.- In season one, you could at least change the way the characters (Kenny, for instance) felt about you. Now, a character is a jerk if the story dictates so, no matter your choice.- Sarah, who is beyond annoying, is probably the most useless character story wise they could come up with. There is no reason for her existence in this game and (spoiler) she goes out in a way that makes you feel she had no purpose in this story.- The characters have no morals. People they knew for the longest time die around them and they feel nothing and/or do not care. Part of this is because of all the characters you ""save"" temporarily, which makes them die in a later episode and make those characters feel like they were meant to be thrown away.- Clementine is way less enjoyable in season. When everything you like about a character is made yours to choose, it just dilutes her personality. And although its understandable, the main character feels annoyingly cynical.- The lack of choice. The only meaningful one is at the end. However, even if its the most meaningful one, it also wont matter because season 3 is BOUND to start the same way with slight variations no matter your choice.- Once you complete it once, and you realize how little your choice matter, you also realize you have no reason to replay it.- The lack of direction. This story is all over the place. Is it about finding Wellington? Saving the group from that horrible leader? Taking care of a baby? Surviving? Making sure the group stays together? Its all of those, and because of it, you don't really know yourself what you're supposed to do, you just ""do"" stuff."

Never had I imagined such a riveting game: Speaking for myself, I'm a female who originally imagined I had no interest in a zombie attack/survival story but when I heard that the heroine is a child, I could not resist buying this incredible suspense game. It was so engrossing in superb storyline, realistic scenery, fascinating character development and tricky combat ... now I worry if any other video games will be able to satisfy me in the future! Lol. I had trouble with one part of getting supplies but other than that, the whole game worked on my older laptop--which is not always the case. (And fyi, I averted my visual focus from zombies during the most intense scenes though overall, there were not too many--just a reasonable amount imo.) A large development team created this artistic triumph and I'm so impressed with the job they did. PS. Now I've bought TWD Season One and it's equally as spellbinding. WOW. I can't wait for Seasons 3, 4, 5, 6 and even beyond!"

It has a lot of the story tied over into this and you won't understand what will happen, mostly.

But the story was quite a bit captivating. Graphics sucks hard, and playability too, but well, it was worth a shot.Now, dealing with season 2, it's completely different. I still don't understand how people can screw more a gameplay which is already crappy. This season 2 is giving far less actions to do, you have much less possibilities to move around than in season 1, it's much more linear than the first season (and that's a challenge since first season was incredibly linear for a game where your choices should have consequences...). They still don't give the player the ability to change the key mapping, so we (aka not qwerty people, just few billions) must play with the arrow keys, but still the qte must be done with Q and E keys. Lame ? Totally. So in the end you have a nice story, which you can't change with any choice anyway, who is effin long to play because the make it artificially long (come on, remove nails one by one? you must be kidding me). And it's completely spoiled by QTE, damn freaking QTE, which are just useless in a point and click game, I mean, QTE, the worst thing in any game, must not be in a point and click game, that's just stupid and it's just make the game more long by two hours, but not two hours of fun, two hours of pain and boredom.To be complete, I must add that leaving the game each time reduce my steam window, that's nothing, just another annoying point.Hopefully one day we'll have a real zombie survivor point and click game, but not yet with this crap of a game."

,Recommended,261030,13667652,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,laker,"They say it's an interactive story, which is true. I don't like calling it a game, because you don't do much. Well, you do stuff, but it's about 10% of the playing time, which isn't much. But at least it doesn't act as if it was something else.The trouble is the false advertisement. I have a huge problem with that. It says ""This game series adapts to the choices you make. The story is tailored by how you play."", which is a blatant lie. There are choices all right, but the outcome is always the same. Maybe some characters leave or die later because of your choices, but from the moment where they could die in the first instance, they no longer have any significance in the story. The ""tailoring based on your choices"" is supposed to be one of the strengths of the game, but it's a lie. I don't understand how all the (professional) reviewers didn't see through this. If they had said something about this right after the first game, maybe it would have changed in later games.But OK, that's politics (ugly lying politics), what about the ""game"" though? Well, if you liked the first season, you will like the second one also. It's a more polished version of the same formula. The graphics fidelity seems higher somehow. Even the game menus look better :D The sound is great. The game assets are really good for the most part. Controls and camera are still not very good, so it can be difficult to start an action because it's unresponsive.The big difference is that now you are playing as an 11 year old cute little girl, which is a nice change from most of the other games out there. The trouble is that all the mature people in the group let you do all the work and it seems really weird. There may be about three instances where they ""help"" you. But that's just because without their help you can't do the thing they've asked you to do. So you play as an interesting character, which is great, but they didn't think through the necessary gameplay changes.The characters are mostly flat and illogical. You won't feel a thing for most of them. There is so much stupid, illogical stuff going on that it breaks any immersion you could have experienced. Why? Because if you had survived in a post-apocalyptic dangerous world for so long, you would have known how to act by now. But these characters don't, they do the most basic mistakes and it's infuriating. Well, I guess it comes with the trademark, 'cause the TV show is just the same.So, again, as with the first season, it's not a particularly good game. There isn't much to it, because the creators didn't pour their hearts and souls into it. It's just a *some* story put into a game engine that makes enough money to make more ""games"" like this using the same formula, so they make even more money out of it.I know it sounds very critical, but that's because I think that if they had cared, they could've made a great experience out of this effort. But they hadn't. I don`t regret playing it, but I`m sad seeing a wasted potential.The bottom line is, if you like ""interactive stories"" or you liked the first season, you will like this one also. If you want to play a ""real game"" I wouldn't bother. And please, if you want to play it, buy it 75% off. And even those 6 euros aren't exactly a fair price for such a poor effort IMHO.(It's 5 episodes, each is 90 - 120 minutes long)"

What I'm trying to say is not that your actions can have unforeseen consequences (which is good), but rather you get to choose different traits of behavior only to sometimes find the options you choose not to match what Clementine does or say afterwards.Also, the number of quicktime events has grown significantly, which doesn't improve on the game in any meaningful way since failing these merely sets you back a few seconds. I know that some people criticized the first season for being to light on gameplay. The way Telltale seemingly  listened to this seems rather lazy, though. Instead of meaningless and distracting QTEs they should have added more in the way of puzzles. What they have done instead is even futher scaling back on puzzles and even on free-roaming locales.I sincerely hope Telltale finds its way back on track for an eventual third season."

Telltale managed to create the perfect balance between having Clementine mature, while keeping the nature of her youth. While gameplay is very simple, the story is the main part of the game. Each episode runs for a perfect length and has you biting your nails in anticipation for the next. I must issue a warning that while the actual game itself is very easy, the choices you make throughout the game are not. literally every choice you make in this game is difficult. Wihtout giving anything away, some choices in this game truly are dreadfuly painful, leaving you with a sunken heart regardless of your decision. Everything in this game from the length, the characters, the art style and the music combine perfectly to orchestrate a dark, morally impactful masterpiece of a story. if you're looking for a game that will grip you from start to finish and captivate every emotion inside you, look no further than Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"""

This is hard to pull off when you're working with 2D objects for backdrop, but they managed it. The forests look great.I did find some minor glitches in the graphics, but it was overall an improvement on the original game.The engine used to make this game looks to be the same one, and as such many of the menus and controls feel very similar to the original game. One improvement is being able to directly click responses, rather than having to scroll through them.The music and sounds in this game are very good, much like in the original game, and definitely help to add a lot of mood to the story.If you liked the original game, then you should definitely get this one as well.

,Recommended,261030,11882191,"Posted: 27 August, 2014",all,Linus,"Telltale's Walking Dead came out of nowhere - nobody expected much. Telltale has been under everyones radar, making some decent adventure games such as Sam & Max or mediocre movie games like Jurassic Park. There was no reason to be excited, especially considering most movie or TV shows converted to games end up being terrible. But then, it turned out to be something quite.. special. An interesting blend of interactive storytelling and classic adventure game gameplay, TWD season 1 ended up being one of the best games in 2012.The brilliant writing, storytelling and characters all were presented in a lovely package that actually exceeded the TV show in terms of.. well... everything.So, season 2. Obviously, it's no longer the underdog, and having to provide follow up the simply phenomenal season 1,  it's clear that Telltale had their work cut out for them. But, I'm glad to say, they managed to continue season 1's quality.First things first, one of the most obvious changes from season 1 is the presentation. The game kept it's charming cel shaded style, but the production values have clearly gone up; the enviorments and beautiful, the characters are well detailed, and the animation quality has improved tons. These changes, while subtle, and arguably not game changing, all help to improve the overall experience, the immersion.Another cool thing about this season is the incredibly cinematography. It's hard not to mash the screenshot button as you play this game. While S1 had some nice shots too, S2 is absolutely loaded with them. It's almost movie-quality at certain points, it's just fantastic.So, it's very cinematic, and that's a good thing but...If there's one bad thing I can say about this season, it's Telltale's determination to exclude all the adventure elements from the game. In season 1, almost every episode you had to solve puzzles, actively seek out people to talk to, find solutions and such. There were ""downtimes"" in the story which allowed for exposition, which had to be manually triggered by the player (in other words, it was actual gameplay).In season 2, it's all gone and done with. Most of the conversations occur ""on rails""; characters present themselves, so you can just focus on the storytelling. The puzzles are also gone - perhaps, because of Telltale's idea that an episode shouldn't be longer than 90 minutes? Their philosophy is that you are supposed to complete these episodes in one sitting, and 90 minutes is the ideal lenght for that. Sadly, I do not agree, and it does lessen the player satisfaction I feel.Sadly, there's another issue I think needs tackling, and it's the choices and consequences. I've been saying since season 1, but it took some people longer to realize. The story is set. You may take slightly different paths, but the destination is always the same, and that's a bit of a shame, and they made it REALLY obvious in some of the scenarios in season 2.But besides those 2 things, I'd risk saying that season 2 is an improvement over season 1 in every way. The writing is great, and it touches upon morally grey areas very well. The game does something very brilliantly, and it's providing a clear view into the villainous mindset. What I mean is, you know what the right choice to make it, but you still struggle to, because of the circumstances. While season 1, your goal was always to protect Clementine, so every choice you made was for her safety and well being. Here though, playing as Clementine, it's completely up to you wether you care about the others, or only just yourself.To summarize, TWD S2 is a nice step up compared to the already excellent first game in terms of cinematography, presentation and storytelling, and despite the dumbing down of the gameplay, I definately prefer it.9/10"

You now control Clementine, and that entails a lot of changes in the way you play the game. You are no more physically strong, yet you're agile, sneaky. That shifts the focus on stealth instead of incessant head bashing, though there's plenty of that as well.Most importantly though, it's the way the world has changed from season 1. In season 1, people were still coming to terms with the fact that dead people were roaming up and about, eating any walking thing they could get their hands on, but not anymore. Now, people have adjusted to the world around them, made peace with the presence of the dead. In this world, trust is as scarce as ammo or food. People are reluctant to let others in, however desperate they may be for help, which is reflected in the apprehension of the new group of survivors in Season 2 to take in a hurt, hungry Clementine.All in all, All That Remains is a great episode. It's just about as long as any of the other episodes, clocking in at 2 hours more or less, but as always it's immensely replayable. The saves carry over, so that's amazing. The game is a lot more tense, atmospheric, there are numerous little changes to the interface and the gameplay. I highly recommend picking this up if you loved Season 1. Can't wait for Episode 2!"

This game definitely lives up to the first game's reputation, containing action packed scenes that even overpass some from Season 1, humorous quips to lighten the mood, and of course, emotional tearjerkers. To be honest, I think this season might even bring more tears than Season 1. When me and my brother were playing this, one scene made me teary-eyed, while one made my brother outright WAIL during it. Whether Clementine will survive the events of this season unscathed remains a mystery, but so far TWD: Season 2 has a bright future ahead of itself, and I cannot wait for the next four epodes to be released. 100/10Episode 2:Telltale has done it again with Episode 2 of the highly acclaimed survival horror story. Following the events of Episode 1, Clementine and the rest of the group are visited by an enemy from their past and are forced to leave in search of a new home. Combat has been highly improved side Episode 1, taking several cues from their other episodic story, The Wolf Among Us. Decisions from Episode 1 heavily impact the story in this episode as you explore different relationships with the rest of the group and decide who you can trust, and even choose to live. Just like Episode 1, it is HIGHLY recommended that you play Season 1 (and for this one 400 Days) before playing this episode if you want to fully experience this episode. The colorful cast of characters expands from the already established main group from Episode 1, including another group you encounter whcih you can choose to be either friendly, or hostile towards. Not only are new characters introduced, but few other's from Clementine's past also make an appearance for the first time this season (Fans of Season 1 all recognize these characters almost instantly.). Overall, Episode 2 managed to successfully overpass the masterpiece that was Episode 1, and turn it up to 11, which can mean only more good fortune from Telltale as we head towards Episode 3.Episode 3:Clementine's story enters its darkest chapter yet as the third installment in Telltale's sequel to 2012's game of the year. Captured by a new adversary, the group must devise a plan to escape their new prison. They will not be doing it alone however, as a new group of recurring characters joins the roster of the survival-horror story. This episode really made me feel like I was playing an episode back from Season 1 of the game, with a few hub areas to ease the growing tension and interact with my newfound friends. This episode also gives us more background as to the history of Clem's group prior to the season's first episode, as well as shedding some light on the new antagonist's motives, which actually succeded in making me feel somewhat sympathetic for him. New allies aren't the only characters introduced; Clementine and the rest of the gorup have to keep an eye out for newly revealed followers of the main antagonist, with some of these figures' motives harkening back all the way to the 400 Days DLC! The ending to this episode was the best of all the three released so far as it raises several questions for players to speculate about before Episode 4 is released. I can easily say with no regrets that this episode is currently may favorite Walkign Dead episode of all time, includign Season 1, episodes! Let's see how you top this masterpiece Telltale.Episode 4:I didn't think it was possible, but Telltale was actually able to create something even better than episode 3. Picking off immediatley after the last episode, Clementine and the group have successfully escaped Carver's camp, but not without a few losses. As soon as you boot up the episode, you get to see the consequences of the final choice you made in Episode 3, and it does NOT end well. On top of this, the group ends up getting seperated, and it is up to you and the few members you have who you may or may not like to get the rest back. Like Episode 3, Episode 4 had a real Season 1 feel to it, with hubs being even more interactive than before. The amount of characters introduced is also very small in this one, which makes the episode for the most part about connecting with the characters you met last episode, as well as maybe reforming bonds that may have been broken by your past actions. Combat felt very light in this episode unlike others, with there not being a single dodge moment in the entire episode, and only about three or four actual walker encounters. The ending leaves the fate of our crew in a ccliffhanger just like Episode 3, but with even high stakes then before. I am literally on the edge of my seat as of now, hoping all of my favorite characters will make it out alive and survive this season's finale episode.Episode 5:""This game series adapts to your choices. The story is tailored by how you play""These words flash on the screen as you start up the final episode to what will most likely be 2014's Game of the Year. While previous choices in Telltale Games such as The Wolf Among Us and Season 1 of The Walking Dead barely changed their endings, they mostly just affected your relationships with the characters during the game. This time around though, your choices actually mean something. Episode 5 starts off with the firefight that ended Episode 4. Left with only a few wounded members. Clementine and the group head out in search of shelter and supplies to cater for themselves, as well as a newborn child. The episode has one touching moment in the beginning where the group lies around a campfire telling tales of their lives prior to the apocalypse. Happy moments like this are rare in TWD universe, so it's really satisfying when they do occur. However, for every light there must be a dark to counter it, and there are LOTS of dark moments. Characters you've grown to love over the season could die do your own faults, other's judge you based on pervious choices you thought were insignificant, and one final choice will take the life of one of two of the games most beloved characters. After the dust has settled, your choices will bring Clementine to one of five different fates, all depending on the choices you've made this season. Some results lead to a final happy ending, while others may have you give a tearful goodbye to your favorite character.Overall, Telltale has managed to create a masterpiece even better then TWD Season 1. Clementine's joinery has a satisfying end, and I cannot wait to see what Telltale has in store for the game's third season coming next year.Final score: BEST. GAME. EVER."

I found myself constantly disapointed by Kenny, yet always willing to give him another chance.Season 2, on the other hand, didn't do it for me.My biggest gripe is that choices are not choices at all. It's a very linear plot and if they do give you the choice to do B instead of A, they will eventually force you to take A. It was very frustrating and it felt like a trowback to tons of other linear games that just funneled you through a linear path and while giving you the ""illusion"" of choice.The other downfall of the 2nd season is that you play Clementine. She's a child, and therefore, her range of actions are limited. This only enhanced the feeling of beeing there for the ride, without any actual power to influence the action.I'm surprised reviews for this game are so good.I've bought ""The Wolf among us"" and stopped halfway because I was getting the same feeling of making only ""cosmetic"" decisions with no actual impact on the story.I find Telltale games are getting lazy.You play those games to be involved and have an impact on the action. If you don't, then you're only watching a very long animation movie for which you need to press buttons once in while for it to continue.How is that different from King's lair and Space ace?

My issue with this is not with Clem thinking she is an adult, but rather with the game itself and everyone around her treating her like so. But hey...that's just me.

Fantastic pace, an interesting plot, and intense decision making made for a memorable interactive story. Considering all those valuable qualities, it seemed likely that the same developer would be able to replicate them for a second season. Unfortunately, they failed to do so.The decisions that once carried so much weight and required nothing short of thorough contemplation really felt meaningless in this installment. Instead of choosing who's life you're going to save with the clock ticking away, The Walking Dead: Season Two prompts you to pick a side in a petty argument. What kind of consequences will your final choice carry? Nothing more than a character ♥♥♥♥♥ing at you for the remainder of the season, conveying pure loathing and hostility towards you simply because you felt that they were behaving childishly (and childish behavior, I might add, seems to be a theme among the characters in this game). What happened to the cool, calm and collected Lee, you might ask? Well, if you played the first season, then you know what happened to him, and apparently any hope of ever encountering another semi-mature character left right along with him.As I've already alluded to in the previous paragraph, the characters were nothing special. A few old faces remain, one of them of course being the character you play as, Clementine, but it seems that any other character who had potential to develop met  their demise. Kenny, who once appeared paranoid for the sake of protecting his family, now wishes to pick a fight with anything that moves and breathes. At one point or another throughout the game, Kenny will fight with just about every new character that's introduced. One would think, ""In that case, I'll just side with the new characters, right?"" Perhaps, if they didn't all behave just like Kenny. Essentially, your options are bleak. Either you side with the obnoxious Kenny, or you side with an equally obnoxious character who you're less familiar with. Those are the biggest decisions you're ever gonna make in this game.6/10 for The Walking Dead: Season 2. If you played the first season and enjoyed it in it's entirety, don't play the second season, so as to preserve the fond memory that you may have of that game and it's characters."

I just found out you can alt f4 out of them, but I play with a controller using Steam Link and the computer is another room. Just stupid to have to watch them over and over.2) Being spoiled at the end of each and every episode with their ''next on the walking dead''. Serious spoilers I mean. SPOILER AHEAD: For example at the end of the 3rd episode, the survivors decide to smear themselves with zombie blood etc in order to pass through a horde, but some of them panick and the episode ends on a cool cliffhanger...that is until ''Next on the walking dead'' rolls in and literally shows you who survives and who doesn't before playing the sequence. Really, really, REALLY stupid.3) In order to avoid to spoil myself, I have to change the channel then come back, watch my stats then let the credits roll for 5 long minutes, either alt f4 by going to the room where the computer is and relaunch the whole damn thing or rechange the channel while they roll the credits. All in all a good 10 min of downtime that breaks the atmosphere for me.Otherwise it's a good game imho, especially if you're like me a fan of the series, and the genre in general...but imho wait and get it during a sale, it's not worth 28 CAD.I hope they fix those issues in the next one..."

This time around, it's doubly frustrating because a lot of the time, the Idiot Ball is passed directly to YOU.Perhaps it's because the WD franchise, in general, maximizes character strife and situational tension through liberal use of this particular trope.  But a game revolving around player choice is bound to be hamstrung, when the player's choices are between ""stupid/moronic/get yourself killed and then pick one of the first two, dumbass"".Mind you, I say this even considering that Clementine is a little girl (Lee isn't, but at least in Season One it happened less often).  Sometimes, it's perfectly reasonable for her to carry that ball.  There's NO such excuse for NPCs who've managed to survive the zombie apocalypse for over a year, only to get everyone killed by pulling a first-week-rookie stunt.  Like, say, having most of the lights on in your highly-visible mountaintop retreat without bothering to close the damn curtains.Pretty sure ""these schmucks were really asking for it"" was not the emotional response the writers were looking for.So while I enjoyed this game for its story, I ended up being repeatedly and severely annoyed by its gameplay.  I honestly think it would have been better as its own Walking Dead spinoff TV show, so at least *I* didn't have to be personally involved in passing the Idiot Ball around."

It had a good story, some touching moments to remember, and a great protagonist.Season 2 is a direct sequel to the first game and tells the tale of Clementine surviving in the apocalypse as a young girl. Having been trained by Lee in the first game, we discover that she is quite adept at survival. Too adept.To put it lightly, Season 2's narrative, while somewhat believable for the first couple of episodes, forgoes any sense of real direction or character integrity FAST. You realise this at the halfway point, when Clementine is the go-to-gal for any kind of incredibly dangerous task her group requires done.Clem is unbelievably stealthy, unbelievably brave, unbelievably smart, unbelievably good with weapons, and isn't phased too much even when walking through a giant horde of walkers. The player is merely a click-vessel for a child power fantasy.This game lacks the single most important Telltale feature - good writing and good character development. Instead, they just seem to be OK with letting the suspense of disbelief run its course on their fans. Over 14,000 positive Steam reviews - and counting - for a game which frankly is a big disappointment for people who wanted a proper sequel to The Walking Dead Season 1.Do yourself a favour and don't play this if you have an attention span.

If you're looking for a continuation of season 1 this is not the game for you. You would be much better off just leaving season 1 where it was, and leaving the story there. This game feels like a cash grab. It feels like the devs realized how successful season 1 was and rushed to spit some♥♥♥♥♥♥out in order to capitalize on the success of season 1. First, you play as Clementine in this game, BUT it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing matter. Everyone in this game treats you like you're still Lee. Every single damn character acts like you're an adult. All the characters heavily value everything you say, and it just doesn't make sense. Changing the perspective from Lee to Clem should mean that characters will treat the player differently. After all Lee was an adult male and Clementine is a little girl. But now everyone just ♥♥♥♥ing listens to you like you're the queen and it's really cuts the immersion. Speaking of cutting the ♥♥♥♥ing immerian remember that little notification that appears in the top left hand of the screen that says ""THAT CHARACTER WILL REMEMBER THAT,"" well expect that prompt to appear about 5 times as much as it did the last game.

Here you're Clementine, a character you've already grown with from S01, a character with such pathos that every decision you make for her is studiously miserable in its build up, dramatically satisfying and clever in its execution. One gruesome scene in particular had me feeling each fraction of an inch of movement on the mouse as a continuous train-wreck-syndrome of mind-♥♥♥♥ catch22s that were as painful to watch as anything from last season, save the fifth chapter.  A few bugs here and there, but the presentation has been cleaned up, too. TT sure can tale a story. Ditch that TV♥♥♥♥♥♥and catch up on this.update:   Now that the final episode is complete I can say that the second season gets a mild recommendation. When episode 4's reviews came rolling in a month or so ago most people pointed out that no matter your actions, Sarah died, Jane left and all went to hell regardless. I think this is indicative of a small backpeddling of quality because really the game has always been like this - it's just been better of maintaining the illusion before now. TWD has always played out like a movie and the end of S1 was so emotionally resonant that you forgot you were really playing a game. You felt dignified in your choices because every one of them had you struggling because the characters had been given enough time to build up a certain amount of empathy necessary for text's drama.It suffers from a sophomore slump and often forgets why its predecessor was so good to begin with - its all about the choices  - as well as leaving you with less of a finale than maybe was expected. I've also learned that these things are best taken all at once, and if I continue with season 3 I'll be waiting until all of it is available before starting.  Clementine continues to be the only reason to continue with the journey, and her growth is the heart of the game. And while she gets a little older here the game relies on romanticizing the past (in a flashback, of all the cliche things they could choose) instead of using it to remind the player of past choices and use that to propel the story. The final episode this season had me glued in some pieces, drifting away in others. More than that, I'm worried the developers are kinda stuck at where to take it next. If it all goes to schlock here we can at least rest on the fact the game had a strong second season and an amazing first one. Heres hoping they can keep the blood pumping next year."

Clementine continues on her journey in Season 2 a little older and more in tune with how bad the world has become.  She shares the spotlight with some new cahracters that you will get to meet.  Episode 1 will have you glued to the screen for the couple of hours it will take you to play (1.5 to 2 hours).The wait between episodes builds up the anticipation and keeps you wondering what could happen next.

It's most definitely worth the money.The first episode, ""All That Remains,"" is in every way a worthy successor to Telltale's Game of The Year. The developer's rather bold decision to put players in the shoes of Clementine - that vulnerable little girl with whom many of us formed a parental bond in the first season - may well be the best decision they could have made. Of course, Clem isn't so vulnerable this time around. She's grown up quite a bit since last year's season finale, and it's impressive how capable and resourceful she's become.That said, she's still a kid. She doesn't have Lee's experience, nor does she have his physical strength. This makes for a completely different experience from the first season, one which is considerably more harrowing. That combined with Telltale's narrative prowess (expect to have your emotions ruthlessly toyed with) makes ""All That Remains"" an undeniably positive experience.The worst thing about the game at the moment is the fact that we've got to wait a few months for Episode Two."

That being said, I feel I can still give an adequate review. If anything changes with future episodes, I'll be sure to make an update.So. Season Two. I was happy to see that Telltale used whatever updated gameplay (be it purely mechanical or an actual engine overhaul) treatment that Wolf Among Us got. Things feel a lot more fluid and responsive, plus the QTE-type events are a lot more varied and refreshing. Things look a lot better too, graphically. Voice acting is - and has been - top notch, in my opinion.Season Two, as I'm sure you know, puts you in the shoes of Clementine - a ten year old girl. I will admit, as much as I loved both Season One and the character of Clementine, even I was a bit skeptical regarding this choice. All the same, they managed to come up with enough comprises to keep things fun and exciting and ultimately I was all too happy to be proven wrong about my doubts.My only real complaint about this game is the over-consolification of the UI but it's pretty much the 'norm' these days I guess.

The gameplay is as simple as before with some changes to the interface, but luckly all of that is compensated with the harsher desisions you'll have to make that are even more morally grey than the previous series.

The amazing story, setting and most importantly story telling earned season one Game of the Year for 2012, and with good reason. The Walking Dead really pulled the player in and got them immersed. If a character close to the player got hurt, died or just left, there was a high chance the player got sick to their stomach. I know I did, more than once. I know some probably cried and although I didn't, I sure came close a couple of times.So now it's time to continue the Walking Dead plot and goddamn, does season two kick off with a bang. The first episode is quite literally a rollercoaster of emotion, it has its ups and its downs when it comes to what you feel like. You'll feel good while playing this, but more often than not you'll probably feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Telltale has done a great job of making you feel like you're controlling a little girl. You can't do some of the things Lee could in season one and you'll have issues with the simplest of things because of your age and physical limitations, which is a good segue to the choices that you need to make in TWD.They're gut-wrenchingly horrifying to make, for better and worse. Better as in the game's doing what it's supposed to do perfectly, and for worse as in you're gonna feel terrible no matter what you do. It seems like there are no right choices, and even though something might feel right, it'll probably go♥♥♥♥♥♥up later on. You'd think that everything being grim and horrible and♥♥♥♥♥♥would be a bad thing, but au contraire. This is perfect for what The Walking Dead tries to do; you feel like you're actually struggling with surviving in this post-apocalyptic world where anything and everything wants to kick you in the teeth.Picking up a hammer might mean that later on you accidentally sit on said hammer and it gets tightly lodged in your♥♥♥♥♥ just like my wallet with all of my money in it if that's what it takes to make the second episode come out any quicker.

The Walking Dead was never about gameplay. It was about telling a story.And tell a story it does. I can't wait for episode 2.The question still remains. What is this?Is it a game? An adventure game? A hardly interactive movie? In my honest opinion it does not matter. If you liked the first season you will love the first episode of the second one. If you hated it you will continue to hate it.

The mechanics are basically the same, but they've been cleaned up a bit and streamlined (for the better).  There is a good mix of dialogue and action.

A Grounded Story About Clementine's Journey Through the Apocalypse.Genre: Telltale Point and Click Adventure.Developed & Published by: Telltale Games.Platform: Windows and Mac.Business Model: Episodic, Season Is Complete.Copy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay ThoughtsTelltale comes back to The Walking Dead series with much of the same game mechanics that comprised the first season. This time around though, it feels even less puzzle driven and more adventure/story focused than before. Not that the original one had that many puzzles to deal with. TWD brings a few more tricks to the field with some new QTEs to keep the character busy. The most noticeable addition is a “sliding” QTE that feels touch inspired, though designed with a mouse in mind. A tich clunky but effective. There’s one particular scene where you’re healing Clementine’s wound that got a little too eye wincing for me. *shudder*. I know QTEs are generally frowned upon (and I share that attitude pretty often) but I have to admit that games such as TWD create them in such a way that keeps me involved without feeling tacked on or unnecessarily finicky. You’ll find a few items for your inventory now and again but their usage is usually restricted to the level you’re on. Nothing that’s changed from Season 1, though their importance feels reduced. Each ""level"" of the game tends to have a bit of exploration and the option to interact with objects or converse with other characters.Thoughts On ClementineThe story picks up some time after season one had finished. The main protagonist is now Clementine which I think is a fantastic choice. Clementine was clearly the standout character last season and seeing the apocalypse from her perspective is a change of pace for the universe. Seeing Clementine’s character mature in this season is also great to see. She feels like one of the best implementations of combining a “blank slate” for the player and still having a personal agenda/character yet. She still commands the player’s respect both mechanically and in the story itself. Furthermore, she remains my favorite character to come out of TWD. Which still surprises me to this day as I write this review. That said, I have to wonder if Telltale are going to let the player decide her personality in Season 3 or fast forward enough years for it to not matter too much. Or, if they’re even going to cover her story at all, as crazy as that might seem. It’ll be interesting to see how she stands in S3.Other Characters and Some Story ThoughtsIt’s mostly a new cast that you get thrust into this season. That’s due to what happened in the last season. However, there are a few characters that make a surprising return from season one. As the game is a narrative-driven experience, I find myself unwilling to talk about the story in fear of spoiling it. That said, I will talk about how the story works overall. For the most part, it follows how TWD S1 worked. Your actions do have an immediate and short-term effect on the story, but the long term effects are mostly corrected for or worked into the overall goals of the narrative. While your experience will differ somewhat every time you play and make different choices, there’s no real way to take the story off its rails. Telltale really isn’t kidding around when they say that the story adapts to the choices of the players. And for the most part this works. Though I did notice at times that the delivery of voice lines after you make choices can come off a bit odd or over/underacted.Still, the story is a dark one of survival. Much of the focus this season is dealing with people close With characters trying to protect what remains of their families, their hope and their humanity. Each struggling with demons that some contain, while others unleash it on those around them. I think all of this helps to keep the story grounded and personable. It feels like these are real situations and dramas that rarely feel forced or unnecessary for the sake of having drama.Business Model Thoughts: Episodic ReleasesI once again abstained from buying The Walking Dead S2 until the entire season was available for release. Though, I did keep my finger on the pulse of what people were saying about each episode. There were numerous delays for many of the episodes of S2, creating some doubts as to whether an episodic model is worth buying into. For myself, I still have mixed feelings on the business model. It still feels a bit too much like pre-ordering at this point. There’s the other problem that having to wait months between episodic releases can cause you to forget what happened in the last episode. But, if people still prefer it, then I don’t have any reason to say you shouldn’t do it. Just realize you may be waiting a long time between episodes. I myself prefer the Netflix approach of being able to enjoy the entire season in “one sitting”. So, I guess having choice is better than not.PC SettingsFrom my playthrough, TWD S2 ran about as well as Season One of The Walking Dead, which was pretty darn good. I didn’t notice any glaring bugs or performance difficulties. The only thing I did notice are relatively minor animation glitches during transitions but I honestly feel like that’s nitpicking to even point them out. Compared to S1, S2’s settings are a lot more limited. Texture quality is the only low/high slider compared to three changeable visual settings of the previous entry. Anti-aliasing and full screen can be turned on or off. Resolutions have a decent selection to choose from which is unchanged from before. Overall, a little disappointing to have less choice in tweaking the game’s graphics but unless you’re running on a really old machine, you’re probably going to set everything to high and call it good. Master volume and music sliders are here though it would have been nice to have a speech audio slider considering how much talking is going on.Final ThoughtsThe Walking Dead Season 2 improves upon the original season while still remembering what it’s about. It’s character-driven narrative, involving the player as much as possible even during what would otherwise be “boring” cutscenes. There is one thing I found really refreshing though. Telltale shows us that they can still have a very character driven story with dramatic moments that are personable and realistic without giant explosions or deus ex machinas getting in the way. It keeps the universe’s bite throughout the five episodes, no pun intended. I am slightly concerned that Telltale may be biting off more than they can chew with the many series they are running  concurrently right now. There are a few odd moments in the series where it felt like the writers might not be on the same page. That or maybe it was the naivety of certain characters that made them say one thing only to do something that contradicted themselves.Ultimately, should you get The Walking Dead Season 2? Yes if you’re entering the series new and yes if you’re wanting to follow up on Season 1. The characters, overall story and continued improvements on what Telltale started in S1 are worth enjoying in this sequel.Read this Review and more on A Paladin Without A CrusadeA Paladin's Steam Review: The Walking Dead (Season One)A Paladin's Steam Review: 400 Days"

,Recommended,261030,12010606,"Posted: 7 September, 2014",all,HulluMarve,"Ah,The Walking Dead. Where do I even start?As many know,The Walking Dead: Season 1 was a HUGE success. It won over 90 GOTY awards in 2012.The game had an amazing atmosphere,amazing characters,voice actors and a very unique art style.Because of that huge success of the first season,it was fairly obvious that Season 2 could never top Season 1.But I think they did well. The second season starts off already with plot twists,emotional scenes and intense situations.Clementine has to keep moving on after the events of Season 1. She is now stronger,mentally and physically.The graphics in Season 2 are quite more comic style-ish than in Season 1. I'm assuming that's because in 2013The Wolf Among Us came along,and that game has the strongest comic book art style out of the three games.The game mechanics have also slightly changed. There's now a click-and-drag kind of action,which is cool.A big difference between the seasons is the objective of the game. In Season 1,the goal was very clear: You played as a man named Lee and you had to protect this little girl,Clementine. In Season 2,I guess the goal is simply: Survive.That makes the plot of Season 2 a little bit messy. First you're in this cabin,then you move on to a ski lodge,then a camp,a historical place and finally... Well,the place where you get to in the end depends on your Clementine.I would say that in Season 1 all the episodes where equally good,where as in Season 2 the quality of the episodes drifts a lot between all five of them. In my honest opinion,I think episodes 4 and 5 were fantastic. There are five possible endings in this Season. I'm not going to spoil anything from them,because that would just ruin the whole fun.So my final opinion about this Season: It's great. Sure,it's not as amazing as Season 1,but it's still a fantastic game.I think the 5 different endings really top this Season off. The new mechanics are cool and the graphics are alright too.Don't get me wrong,there are quite a few cons in this season,such as pointless and cheap deaths (surely not all of them,though),dialogue glitches (there are a bunch of them especially in Episode 4),characters developing and suddenly being killed off,the antagonist we thought would control the whole season dies very soon in the game,and one thing that has bothered me a lot during this season: Time jumps.Overall,I suggest buying this game. It has some replay value since there are some decisions that actually have very different outcomes. A lot of emotions,some happy and funny moments,intense situations and more. If you haven't played Season 1,you should play it before playing Season 2,so that your choices wont be randomly generated and you have more of an idea of what the story is about so far."

The game decreased in every episode and now I question my decision to buy it.The game has it's own style,so don't expect a FPS, neither a point and click. There are more actions than TWD Season1.I see this more like being part of the comic book story that shows some important decisions that you take.The story is looks very interesting for the zombie' style fans just because it has zombies, but it just lost it's path towards the end of the season. I got bored and could see the problems ahead.The rich dialog gives good choices, but it gets poorer, also overall there are still just 5 big decisions per chapter and no big differences based on those decisions until the end.I liked/accepted the game, but repeating it is strange as some decisons that you took in the first time sounded so important and in the second once you select a different answer then nothing really different happens causes frustation. So, in my opinion it is a one time game that got poorer overtime.Buy if it has a discount, I bought at full price exited with the TWD1 and I am questioning my choice."

You were left with your guts and your morals.Now season 2 is the same, except the story isn't as good. Namely, the characters are very inconsistent. They seem to serve the plot rather than have their own distinct agenda and will to survive.Where you had the option to intervene in a tense dialogue in Season 1, now you don't get to do that... seems like the game is holding you back, preventing you from choosing because allowing you to choose would not make the story go the way the writers want it to go.Anyway, I didn't have fun with Season 2.

The main part of Season 2 falls into place 16 months after the events of season 1, and let me just say WOW. I got this game while both ep 1 and 2 of the Season have been released, and I am once again hooked on this series. I will now go through, what I feel, are the negatives and positives of this game. Please advise I will try reviewing without giving away too many spoliers and info about the story itself, that is up to you guys to discover and play for yourselves. :)-------POSITIVES----------Price - I definatly have gotten my money's worth out of this game. For just 25 bucks currently you get episodes 1 and 2, and the rest for free as they are released. If you are NOT SURE ON GETTING THIS GAME, then I would advise you waiting for one of the Steam sales before purchasing.-Story - The lore of the story is so good, it is almost unbelievable. The game continues off of choices that you had made in Season 1 AND in the DLC for Season 1, 400 Days. You do have the option to choose to continue from different Season 1 saves, or just to not continue from Season 1 at all. If its the case you want to do that, the game will randomly generate choices from Season 1 from episodes you didn't complete. Now back tot he story, the voice acting is, in my opinion, pretty good, and whoever voice acts Clementine has hit it spot on. There are many surprises throughout what I have played, in fact,    the game kind of slaps ya in the face, not even 10 minutes into the game. Also, Im not going to spoil anything, but there is a major suprise in episode 2, and for anyone who has played Season 1 like me, your going to be jumping for joy, or kicking yourself in the shin depending on how you played the game. To summarize, this game has a great story with many twists and turns that any true Walking Dead fan is going to love.-Voice Acting - I know I talked about it a bit up there, but I think that it was so good, it deserved its own place. I have no clue where Telltale gets their voice actors, but they definatly hit a home run with it. At times the voice acting may be a little dull, especially with 1 or maybe 2 characters in perticular, but overall, an amazing job by the voice actors.-Decision Making - This is yet another area of the game where I think the developers did another amazing job. There are many spots in the game where it requires you to make a tough decision. While not all of them may really matter in the long run, the game really makes you think ""Wow this is an ACTUAL decision someone might have to make in everyday life, and if I pick this one, then I'll feel bad for that character. However if I pick this one, then I'll feel bad for that character."" Now don't go thinking that this is a game of life or whatever, because it's not. It's a zombie game, and there are alot of decisions that put one or the other's characters lifes' on the line. So you really do have to make every choice with the thought in the back of your head that, ""Hey! Maybe if I do this then that character won't like me and he won't help me when we're in trouble later. Of course you won't be thinking THAT far ahead because of the intense storyline that is taking place right in front of you, but the thought is always there.-Lag/Framerate - For me, the game did a decent job of keeping everything running smooth. I had a little to no framerate problems, while in Season 1, during the first few episodes I had some trouble with lag. I was glad to see the lag didn't carry over to this game aswell.--------NEGATIVES----------Episode Shortness - There aren't too many negative thing about this games, but if I could pin point one big one, it would be that the episodes, SO FAR (episodes 1 and 2) are REALLY short. I'm not too experienced at these types of games, and I was able to finish both episodes in about 3 hours worth of time. Hopefully the future episodes are longer, but since I'm making this review before episodes 3, 4 , and 5 have came out, I can't say anything about them. But that, so far averages at about 1.5 hours per episode, altough episode 2 was longer then episode 1, so either way the episodes were considerably shorter then Season 1. I put 15 hours into Season 1, not including the extra hour that the DLC gave me. Im really hoping the next episodes will be longer.-[WARNING BEFORE PLAYING] Gruesome Scenes - Although I personaly dont mind, nor do I care if a game has gruesome scenes, I thought I'd warn the younger players aswell as those with a faint heart that there are gruesome scenes in the game.And that was my review. I hope I helped some of you decide whether or not you want to buy this game. :)"

Heck, I'll probably play both the seasons again and choose the opposite choices, boy will that be fun. But I highly recommend you buy season one before season two, or you will probably be very confused and this game will lack sentimental value for you. This game is definitely in my top ten, and for me that's really saying something (considering how many games I have). If you don't already have this game, and have completed season one, buy this game. It will be good for you.#KennyIsBae"

The story seems to continue not too long after the first season. A new series of characters and nice new story line, and even a nice surprise from Season One (you'll know when you see it). In this case, there are a couple of different endings so you will want to change your game play to see them.The only downside, if you can call it that, is that the story seems much shorter than season one. I was surpised by that. I seemed to have finished it rather quickly the first try.As usual, bought on discount and worth the $5 I paid.So if you are a fan of the first game, this won't disappoint either."

The story is as tense, gripping, and emotional as the first Season, and I would argue it's improved over the first season, in no small part because of the freshness playing as Clementine brings to the Walking Dead and the zombie genre as a whole.The tech issues of previous Walking Dead games are much reduced, if at all present, but if you had grips with the first season, those gripes will likely still be present, though this has never impacted my enjoyment of the game. Gameplay-wise very little has changed, and thus the criticisms for Season 1's gameplay will still be there. Its innovation, and where I have always enjoyed it, is in the story, and if that's what you're looking for, rest assured The Walking Dead Season 2 satisfies."

The highly awaited sequel to The Walking Dead does everything to live up to its predecessor -- and surpasses it. The game has all of the charm and grim, dramatic atmosphere and storytelling of the original, but with improvements. The biggest and best changes from the original are the conversation choices, interaction with the environment, and quick time events during action sequences. They are done virtually identically to Telltale Games's other recent game, The Wolf Among Us. As a result, the conversation choices are easier to see and select, and the player feels more immersed in the action scenes.Just like in the first game, the story is excellent and intriguing. The player very quickly bonds with Clementine, the protagonist. The player feels genuine concern for her well-being and fear when she's in danger. The end of the first chapter just leaves the player craving more.The Walking Dead: Season 2 promises to be a phenomenal game. Go play it now."

Having played through episode 1 I am happy to see my trust in telltale was not at all misplaced.  Right off the bat you will be put on the emotional rollercoaster one has come to expect from Telltale's Walking Dead series.  However, the bar having already been set high you will still not be prepared nor disappointed with the various settings, emotional events, and above all intellectual/ethical quandries put before you this time around.  What I love most about this series is the nuanced nature of your decision making, which creates a lot of versatility and replayability despite one's desire to see things in black and white, good and evil.  In order to survive you have to make imperfect decisions , deal with their consequences, and learn to live with them.

It also does not hold any punches in the amount of trauma that you are forced to endure in order to stay alive within the post-apocalyptic world of ""The Walking Dead"".Interestingly, the controls have had a bit of an overhaul, in that the quick time events are a little more dynamic, and require more than just simply mashing the Q button, and then pressing E. There are dodges that need to be made, and if you fail to quickly scan your surroundings, you may end up being eaten.Some of the more pressing, and heart felt moments of the game shatter like a reflection in the mirror. Clementine can trust no-one. No-one. Trust me on this."

This time though- you take control as the one everyone loved, Clementine. You can tell she's aged a bit (but I won't tell you how much!)Many a things happen in the first episode- which is exactly what should happen- along with a huge amount of people to meet. Most of the Characters are forgettable- at least name wise, it might be me but I simply cannot remember many of these characters by name- and I am recalling this from playing the episode yesterday.Clementine has went through a TON of character development- you will be able to tell about twenty or thirty minutes in that she is no longer who she once was because of everyone she loves dying around her.Even throughout the first episode you will see her change over and over (I again, won't say how, but it is impressive!)Overall, I have no qualms or satisfaction issues, I enjoyed it all and love/hate getting teased by the cliffhanger!I would give this game a 9/10 and would easily recommend to all I know interested in the zombie franchise era :)Truly,TwR"

Surely you’ll be spared the worst of the world because of who you are? Don’t count on it: the episode is more or less a compilation of all the worst crap that happened to you in the first season. Thankfully, it isn’t spiteful about it – The story is well paced, ensuring some downtime to reflect on the lowest lows. Additionally, the way each occurrence unravels the new setting, or causes coincidences that motivate later happenings, ensures you’ll be gripped until the conclusion.Episode Two: A House DividedFull review available hereWith two solid episodes under its belt, Season Two has moved into unequivocal recommendation territory for all but those who’ve failed to gel with the series’ acquired taste. Even then, A House Divided helps to further the impression that this could be a season that exceeds the first: it’s far more assured than the plodding first half of Season One – and if it’s going to hit the highs of the second half, it’s well worth buying in sooner rather than later."

The first season caught everyone by such surprise and continued to wow us untill it's emotional conclusion. But Season 2 Episode 1 (S2E1) just didn't seem to gain the same momentum as the first. (I'll try to spoil as little as possible) As you may already know we step into the shoes of Season 1's sidekick Clementine... And there in is our problem. In S1, Clementine had the importance of a lamp. A lamp that you had to protect and watch over and was the root cause of many sad moments. But as a character she was weak, unrelatable and did some really dumb things to jeopardize others. So by making her the lead in S2 I just had a problem getting invested in her character. I will say that her voice actress did a great job in getting that ""I've aged a little"" difference in the voice. But unless Clementine is crying or yelling in pain, every spoken word is read off a page with the emotional depth of a wet brick. Gameplay remains unchanged, with some minor interface changes and a new ""run and dodge"" sequence added to the ""mash buttons"" troupe.I may be sounding overly negative but I guess S2E1 is OK at best but I'm going to be hopeful for improvements."

There was good use of character building however I was dissapointed about less usage of the characters from the 400 Days DLC. However, the idea of bringing back Kenny was A brilliant idea since he was one of my favourite characters from Season 1 and the ending was excellent since there were more questions left unanswered which makes me think there's going to be a Season 3.

It's obvious that TellTale knows exactly what made the first season a success and is harnessing it to their full ability, and man am I excited for what's in store. Can't review a season entirely off one episode, but I can already tell this will be intense, and very very enjoyable. I might as well say, there are some slight graphical and overall asthetic improvements, which makes the game look very pretty, but who really plays this for the visuals?

After beating the first episode i can not wait for the second to come out. However i would like some awesome plote twists (like returning episodes from the first game). maybe when Kenny went to save ben he didn't die and will come back and find clem. Or maybe (and hear me out on this one) Clem could be  seeing images of Lee and that will drive her crazy. Over all i give this game (and the first) a 11 out of 10.

,Not Recommended,261030,13946086,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Elusivewater,"The first one had excellent characters that you could mostly like. Yes some of them were flawed but that was the point of the world: people were flawed. Lee was a very likeable character because they had a lot of versatility with his character. There were only maybe two characters I liked throughout the game. One of them was somewhat charming and the other was fierce, reckless and smart. All the other characters pretty much acted selfish and didn't really have much character in them. For example Sarah was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, her dad was overcaring, Rebecca was a ♥♥♥♥♥ and Alvin was quiet. Those were the characterizations for those characters, there wasn't much character development between when you met the characters and so on.Playing as Clementine though, she just somehow becomes the voice of reason then immediately treated like a little girl. She is also a very lifeless character throughout this season being very inconfident of any of her answers while at the same time seeming to make too much sense as a girl. So overall I felt like this game sort of contradicted her character too much. At least in season 1 it made sense that you were the voice of reason, it might not be fair to compare this season to season 1 also because season 1 was the start of the outbreak and lots of conflict could happen while many people were still confused. Although in this one people were still confused and acted somewhat childish, But I think I just went on a weird tangent there, overall season 1 was a lot more satisfying of a game than this one whereas you play as a soulless child in a gritty dark world where pretty much nothing goes right and it just makes me not care in the end with little to no sympathy for anything bad that happened to any characters."

However, solid is all it is. There are notable flaws that make this feel like a step back from Season 1. Season 2 starts off roughly two years after the events of Season 1 (Disregarding the prologue). You play as Clementine, the little girl that you took care of in Season 1. She starts her own journey with a new group that faces a new threat other than the walkers. Season 2 starts off strong, but slowly goes downhill, with episode 4 and 5 being the killing blow into mediocrity.PROS:-Great voice acting-Some hard decisions-Writing is solid during episode 1,2, and 3-Some emotional scenes-Some good characters-Visuals improved-Dark and gloomy, perfect TWD atomosphereCONS:-Bad pacing, everything happens too fast to where you can barley talk and develop with the group. And when people die, the episode goes too fast to where you barley care-No consequence, this goes with pacing in a way, because the game goes too fast at points that you can barley reflect with the group on what you did and where poeple don't call you out. Choices barley matter-Clem as a protagonist, it starts off fine because the game shows her weaknesses and strengths and the need to be in numbers with likeminded survivors, but by episode 4, she is shown to be 10 times stronger and smarter than any of the people in the group. As well with the group sending Clem to all the suicide missions because they can.-People die way too often and quickly. ""How can this be a flaw?"" you ask. Well in Season 1, you had time to talk and develop with many of the characters. So when they died, you cared. Season 2 disregards this completely. The game takes charcaters and then kills them off to make a plotpoint or when they've lived out their usefulness.I know the cons seemed like a rant, but these probelms really did furstrate me. I still recommend Season 2. Just know it's not as good as Season 1 by a longshot.Verdict: 7/10"

Apart from the occasional QTE sequence or segment where you wander around small environments interacting with people or objects, there is really very little here that could traditionally be called “gameplay.”  Honestly, I don't mind this in theory.  Telltale seems to have committed to making interactive cartoons that are more about making choices and seeing how they play out as their model of game design, which is an interesting and worthy approach.Unfortunately, thus far they have yet to fully tap into the potential that such an approach to game design promises.  A major problem with season 1 of ""Walking Dead"" was that your choices rarely branched beyond the end of the following episode.  So if you made a choice that leads to the death of person A over person B, chances are whoever remains alive will be written out of the story by the end of the next episode.  This meant that playing the game eventually became an exercise in waiting for the other shoe to drop.  By the end, if I did anything that led to a distinct outcome, I immediately began looking to see how the writers would resolve the issue in the next episode in order to bring the branching storylines back together.  Season 1 was still fun despite this because the formula was still new and Telltale did a good enough job of sustaining the illusion of choice, however tenuously.Season 2 makes no effort whatsoever to disguise or innovate on this formula, though. Unlike Season 1, significant choices rarely have consequences beyond a single episode, much less 1 or 2 out.  And while the game makes a note of indicating that X or Y character will “remember” your actions and responses, the game seems to do next to nothing significant with this information.The game’s plot also displays a distinct sense of running in circles.  Drama relies to an absurd level, at times, on characters arguing in the midst of imminent peril, a conceit that works some of the time, but after a point you can see the writers straining to use this device to inject drama into the most petty and trifling situations, making the cast of characters come off more like a pack of whiny, immature, babies than a group of fully realized adults dealing with extraordinary situations.  This is compounded by the fact that the game also employs a series of equally contrived situations to ensure that Clementine remains the key decision maker and mediator in the group, giving the impression that the game’s adult characters would fall to pieces and be completely incapable of making the most minor decisions if not for the input of an 11 year old girl.Here’s hoping that in season 3 Telltale will use a bit of the boatload of money they are making from these games to revise their formula to focus more on branching storylines and decisions that matter."

You faced moraldilemmas like, ""Do I save this person or that person?"" or ""Do I leave this person behind?""They had 1 or several moral decisions per episode over a course of 5 episodes,Most of these dilemmas were tough choices where you had to make a choicewithin a given amount of time, After having made a decision, you had to live withthe consequences of that decision, whether they were good or bad. It made thegame worth playing a few times to see different consequences to a certain decision.In The Walking Dead Season 2, none of the dilemmas had tough decisions to make.Each dilemma had two decisions and the characters in the game reacted in ONE wayno matter which decision I made in the dilemma!--The characters have no personality:In Season 1, the characters each had a personality and were memorable. They eachhad a specific trait that you remember about them. They had different opinions than I didin certain situations, like real people.In Season 2, since they act the same way no matter which decision you make, the charactersare uninteresting. In these games, you can treat the characters in any way you choose. You caneither be nice or treat them like crap. In this game no matter what way you treat them, their opinionof you never changes. They don't grow to hate you if you're a jerk to them and there are no benefitsof being nice to them either. These new characters are boring and create no interesting conflicts inthe apocalypse that this game takes place in.--The gameplay feels restricted:In Season 1, the game made you explore and look for ways to complete certain goals.It made you look for the answer without telling you. It actually made you think in some situations.Most of the time these situations where you had to think weren't very hard to figure out. These situations held the gameplay up at certain points. It mixed small puzzles with moral dilemmas and consequences to your decisions.It made the game interesting and you always wanted to see what happened next,In Season 2 the game has a linear path that you have to follow. Sometimes the gameputs you in an interactive environment, but it doesn't have any small puzzles or situationsthat require thinking. The entire game feels like one long, interactive cutscene. So muchemphasis is put on the new uninteresting characters that barely any interesting gameplayever happens. It does this the entire game too, being boring and dull the entire time.____________________________________________________________Those three things hold me back from enjoying this game. The first and biggest issuehas to be the fact that your choices barely change anything in the story. I didn't careabout any of the characters because of their lack of personality. The final thing is thatthis game put too much emphasis on the uninteresting characters rather than actualgameplay."

I can't understand how the writers worked together on this and though it was a good idea in any fashion.  Just let it go TWD S2 writers, you've could of spent those lines on the new cast of characters instead of dredging up the same exact thing again.The illusion of choice isn't nearly as well-done this time around either, and despite choices being meaningless for the most part in the first game, it still felt important and season two fails in that regard.I'm enjoying playing it, but it's a step in the wrong direction on most fronts and tries to continually up the ante to the point where nothing feels suspenseful.  Not surprised to find out some of the main people that worked on season one weren't involved in this game.Edit: Just finished the last episode.  It continued the trend of the story being really stupid and cemented this game as a one-time playthrough and uninstall.  Honestly, outside of the first few hours, it's like the game is actively trying to be bad with it's story-telling.  I loved the first game and the 400 Days DLC but this game went from fun bad to just annoying bad and kind of sapped any interest I had in season three, which will likely feature retconning the writers' favorite character again and giving him another huge role."

Here there is none. Not only are chracters that you will love die but you wonder why in this matter and the lack of respect they have for these charcters. Not only that there is choices that characters make that doesnt coincide with their personality and it makes you question why they would do that. You dont have as much freedom to as Clementine to speak to these other charcters, Like you did as Lee. It feels trully like a linear story with very little choice until the end.What disappoints me most is I wanted to love this season. In actuality there were some good things to like about it. They're charcters that i love and hate (good hate) in this season. the atmosphere is amazing, and you get to be Clementine who I feel is almost if not the best child character in gaming, and its fun seeing her progress through this apocalypes.I was left at the end of this game with a bitter taste in my mouth and questioning the writing choices Telltale made. Though I still have faith in telltale I'm now a little cautious with there upcoming games, esspecially Wolf Among Us.

Hopefully this doesn't spoil much but just in case *SPOILER ALERT* people die constantly. Unlike Season 1, the game/the writers don't give you a chance to connect to the characters and give you a chance to develop a relationship.

The writing ranges from touching and clever to downright stupid and ludicrous. It feels like the ""Main"" episodes, 1, 3 and 5 were written by morons but Episode 2 and 4 were somewhat well-handled. A Great character might be introduced in Episode 2 only to completely destroy his characterization in the following episode.It seems that every time things get going they're shot down in the following episode and at the end it all feels like it went nowhere. No amounts of blood splatter, shocks/twists or deaths can make up for the awful characterization you get here in Season 2 of The Walking Dead."

The narrative has gotten progressively weaker and less focused, plot arcs are swapped and dropped with every episode, and determinant characters get nary more than a line after their critical moments. The illusion of choice so judiciously maintained throughout Season 1 has all but evaporated.Characters are under-developed, and often die well before they're explored in any meaningful way. Don't expect anyone to notice their deaths if they doen't occur when the writers intended for them to occur, either. It seems the characters have become just as apathetic as some of the players have (though it's by no means intentional).Still, the first two episodes are promising, even with their hiccups. It's everything after that, when TellTale started moving writers around, where the quality decayed. It's not worth the $25 at all."

Season 2 just left a bad taste in my mouth right from the start, that just got worse.The premise of this season is that you have to choose who to trust to ensure your survival, but the reality is that you'll repeatedly have to make decisions to do things that even the most inept party of survivors wouldn't even begin to think of leaving to a little girl, so the premise is flawed and immersion-breaking.In keeping with the tradition of the worst survivalist fantasies, any morally-positive decision WILL hurt someone's chances for survival, unlike the more nuanced co-operative spirit of Season 1 where, particularly, the Lee-Clementine relationship at least functioned frequently to reward less selfish decisions.  No matter, as it seems that no decision you think you're making in Season 2 will really have any effect on the story anyway.There are no persistent likeable characters and very few of those quiet bonding moments that were the highlights of Season 1 - and why bother bonding with anyone anyway?  Forgettable characters drift in and out of the story; you will quickly notice the pattern that if anyone seems nice, then they will die horribly and entirely futiley, very very soon..."

The writers sometimes succeed well in telling a story, and sometimes it’s very uneven. If you play all episodes in one row you will notice a massive overload of dramatic reactions towards decisions a little girl does, as well as that little girl being the only person capable of making sensible decisions most of the time. For some reason (because you control her) this little girl is regarded as the most skilled to do almost every task. And she is. There are also a horde of random events affecting the story and people constantly making rash and erratic decisions. I guess they were afraid the story would get boring otherwise.The walking dead is basically a linear story where you as a player have to point and click to make the story continue. There are choices to be made, sometimes with time pressure, which will alter other people’s attitude towards the main character (Clementine). Sometimes your choices will trigger a different movie to show events. But the result of your actions are always nil. No one will survive because you choose this and that, and nothing will better or worse because of your choices. Nor can you find items that will help the party in any other way than the party member possibly saying so. Nothing really matters. Regardless of the choices you make you will end up at the same place in the fifth and last episode. Because it is the last episode, the developers allow you to make a difference and choose whether to stay with person A, person B or going it alone… and that triggers different endings. But all decisions in the previous four episodes have no impact at all. Just as your decisions in season 1 had no impact in that game, and the decisions you made that were carried over to season 2 (as the developers claim) have no relevant impact.It is genius in a way from the developers to create a game where I have no impact, but the fact that I need to click here and there to keep the story going obviously get users feel that they influence the game. The fact that they don’t seem to not matter that much to most users, hence the praises of the game. And that is fair in a way, because feelings is what matters! To me personally the feeling is ruined by the insight that the decisions I make have no impact. That makes the choices irrelevant, and thus me thinking about them or caring about them irrelevant. If I look beyond the pretty dishonest claim that choice do matter and impact the game, the interactive story is entertaining and good enough to watch. The fact that I am involved in pushing the story forward do add to that feeling.Besides the general criticism there are also flaws because of laziness when it comes to the different movies after decisions. It’s not only that the decisions I make have no impact, but sometimes the devs haven’t bothered to change the movies afterwards at all. Since the events are the same, they seem to want to reuse things too much sometimes making conversations a bit weird as they have the same attitude towards my doing regardless if I choose to help a person or not. But generally this doesn’t shine through that much.I bought this game at a heavy discount, because I was bored from having a cold. Was I entertained for that price? Sure! I played the game pretty quickly and didn’t look back. I wanted to see the end of the story. I am hesitant whether I should recommend the game or not. It’s not bad, but it’s not brilliant. It’s a linear story which demands that I click now and then. I should give it thumbs up because I am a positive person. But I cannot get over the dishonesty of playing with emotions and beliefs that what I as a user do makes a difference. That is basically a lie. So… I give a thumb down. But you can always read the review and understand why ;)"

Spoilers follow.Mostly because the majority of the game reviews are positive already. But lemme be real here. The game's not bad. If you liked the first one, chance are you'll like this one too. It's got some great moments, and some memorable and crazy choices.However, I never felt like the cast of characters developed as effectively as the first 'season'. You're quite literally thrust into the group and very few if any relationships develop as a result. Additionally, characters die *so* fast, that after part 3 I felt myself pullling away knowing it was very likely that no one would be left alive by the end. I get that losing characters is dramatic, and can certainly be very effective, but when you watch this many people in your group get killed, I couldn't help but find myself pulling away. This is a weird comparison, but Modern Warfare 2 suffered from a similar issue, CoD4 had a pretty effective moment where one of your player characters dies, so what does the sequel do? Tries to pull that♥♥♥♥♥♥two more times. It's just dumb, and immersion breaking.I also can't help but note but there seems like there's even less interactivity then the first season. I enjoyed some of the quieter moments in one, particularly when you were given a limited number of food items and had to decide who could eat that day. In this, nothing. Dialog choices, jamming on Q action scenes, and a rare minute or two where you walk around and examine three different things in the environment. I know this is a lot of people's big complaints about these telltale titles, but I never thought about it in Season 1 or Wolf Among Us as I did in this. It made me feel like user interactivity mattered even less than it already does, which, let's be honest, isn't all that much anyway. Which could be fine, but it needs to maintain the illusion or it fails at what it's trying to portray. It's no longer your story.Another little thing, but there are multiple time jumps in this story, with the first one being, what, sixteen months? That's ridiculous to me to think that nothing of importance happens in all that time. The series has never been great regarding supplies, no one even has a ♥♥♥♥ing backpack, but are you kidding me I'm just supposed to shrug off sixteen months being like 'and they were fine and nothing happened'? ♥♥♥♥ you.  I don't buy it.The multiple endings definitely helped, and I pretty much enjoyed the entire ending sequence, albeit it does get pretty ridiclous.

Other aspects are similarly clunky, from the animation to the voice acting, predictable scares, and padded puzzel sequences.

Moments that should be perilous aren't because for the player all you have to do is press and hold up on the keyboard. It seems scary until you realize that as long as you press the basic button prompts everything will be fine (relatively). There is no challenge or strategy, there's no real danger. Once you realize that most of the input is just annoying time sinks before the next cutscene.I could forgive all this if the story were good, but it fails in all the ways zombie fiction tends to do. People are unnecessarily stupid and make stupid choices, there are unnecessary deaths that could be saved easily if people weren't stupid, and people act ridiculously for the sake of drama and to get a reaction out of the player. If you were a fan of the first game it's worth buying on sale just to finish the story so far (the first is no stranger to this kind of stupid drama, but this one takes it a step even farther), but if you're thinking of picking it up otherwise I wouldn't recommend it at all."

It was somewhat fresh back then and the characters were so likeable, that you had no other choice but to follow them up to the (bitter) end.Second season, obviously, lost that duo. Instead, the story now only focuses on Clementine (and some other character whose name would be a spoiler).So, the most important question is: ""Did that work?""To begin with, there're not as many likeable characters as there were in the first season. The new group of survivors that Clem ends up with is pretty lackluster and not as loveable as Lee's group was. The story is (again) somewhat linear, however the ending now has much more options for you to choose, so at least there's that.You won't notice any of that, however. The idea of an eleven-year-old girl being the protagonist of the whole season is what makes this game shine. The concept alone is amazing, sure, but here it is so well-done and well-written, that it makes up for other characters being ""not as good"". The first episode of the season had more heartbreaking and unsettling scenes than the whole first season had (that scene in the shed is painfull just to think about).The answer to the question above would, obviously, be ""yes"".Holy crap, it worked, Telltale."

I know the graphics aren't for everyone, but if you love a good story this is the game for you.Sound: 8/10: Some excellent jump scares in there as usual,Gameplay: 9/10 - Fantastic. There wasn't a moment where I didn't know what to do.Lasting Appeal: 10/10 - One of the best games of all time.Overall: 10/10 - Play it if you have a soul.Remembering this, I would give The Walking Dead: Season 2 the following;Story: 9/10 -  Not quite as good as the first, but definitely a worthy successor to the first game, and has a lot of potential for future episodes.Presentation: 9/10 - The presentation of this game has been mainstreamed a lot and looks really really nice.Graphics: 8/10 - Still the same old but with a new charm this time. The UI has been updated and the game doesn't lag when you press escape. Much nicer to look at.Sound: 8/10 - Same old sounds, still excellent, and the music is just as heart wrenching.Gameplay: 9.5/10 - The action scenes are still excellent but with an improved UI you will be having a much nicer timke looking at it.Lasting Appeal: 9.5/10 - I would play this again if I had time. Definately some great decisions.Overall: 9.5/10 - If you like storylines or liked the first season, you will love this.A very fitting followup to the very first game, the story is fantastic but without Lee it feels different, but perhaps for some that is a good thing. The game had a lot of moving moments and the same old situations where I was left thinking, ""Far out, I'm not sure what option to pick."" Fantastic game, if you enjoyed the first one you will enjoy this one."

It's more immerse, extremly dark and on top of that people act believeably. Basically this game is all about immersion and storytelling and Telltale stepped up the game. I mean, it's about that little details, like credits with proper depressing background and melancholic music. The choices again didn't matter (probably) but the way you're able to shape Clementine's personality, it's just incredible. Everytime I wanted to do something, I got a dialog or action for it. At the first time I felt like I was living the story and not playing the game. Of course the ""drawback"" is that it hit me pretty hard and I'm emotionaly quite overwhelmed.

Let me give a short summary of the story: After 3 YEARS, Clementine is still living with zombies. She meets new characters and ""newish"" setting. The more you compare this game to the original, the harder it is to play. It would be ok by itself and I know it hard to live up to expectations, but there is so much you can do with post-zombie era. There can melt religious cults or more about prejudice or mental illness like depression. History channel has a show about this. It’s just boring to still be talking about how there so many zombies when there should have rotten away.Besides the zombies, how are the characters well… they’re kinda forgettable. They just don’t have any color to them like I feel for characters in Season 1. Hell you got to choose between them who you wanted and that was great! Too bad you have less choice here. Oh it’s not like the magic is gone. Literally there’s obviously less meaningful choices here. There’s NO deciding who leaves or dies here. NONE. You can say it, but you have the same group of people as everyone else.It just feel like there’s less effort in the Season 2 than Season 1. My theory is all the work went into Wolf Among Us (which you should buy first). Unless they do something dramatically different I’ll skip the rest of Walking Dead."

It offers almost nothing Season 1 didn't do, and did it better. It starts awfully, with Episode 1 being a total generic mess, and slowly gets better, with Episode 5 almost reaching what Season 1 achieved. There is no goal, no persistant aim, the story is just a series of disconnected events that take place, and the only thing that seems to be building up to anything that could be a plot is all dealt with half way through the season. They kill off old characters for no reason, bring back old characters in ways that they shouldn't, and bring in new characters where old characters would have fit just as well. There's some good stuff in here but it's not worth wading through the garbage to get to it."

At the end of the game, it was revealed that my decisions all fell into the majority camp. None of the big decisions seemed to have the gravitas so often evident in the dilemmas of the first season.Despite this qualm, the game is rivetting, albeit not enjoyable - it's hard to find any joy here. This was a particularly dark tale; it was pleasing to see the focus on Clem did not lead to the 'Disneyification' of the story.Although some will find the impact of last season's decisions to be underwhelming - here is little suggestion they played a part - overalll, this was money well spent.

The gameplay is more immersive though, making you move in certain directions to avoid danger, and I personally found the decisions and storyline significantly more interesting.10/10 would recommend."

With the multiple different endings that make you think twice it is a thrilling continous of the first game and i know what your thinking if you are like me: not ritch but I tell you that it is worth the 25 dollars, and that is practically a discount because this game should be worth full price (60.00 bucks) and if you dont like different endings still try it because this ain't your grandmothers changing storybook endings, ether if you f*** up someone dies and the game gets a new point I mean there are 4 yes i said four different endings and if you like shooters then this is the game for you too because EVERY zombie game including this one has a lot of guns so if your still not convinced then play the first game and skip to episode five right off the bat and if you don't find out what happens before and after that you might just be a zombie, because with 5 very long episodes this zombie tailor game is  going to infect you to like al of the rest of us... blahhhhhhhhhhhhh I guess but my point is just go and buy the game.

,Recommended,261030,11099008,"Posted: 6 July, 2014",all,Oman 2,"Updated for Episodes 4 & 5First off, compared to Season 1:- The wierd/dodgy textures are fixed, it looks pretty good- The movement (relative to POV) makes more sense- More interesting quicktime sequencesAnd now to business:I found S1 to be a thrilling game, I tried to protect Clemetine from bandits, cannibals and just plain wierdos - but I was unable to do so much of that, and it left me feeling guilty, sad and feeling quite a bit of empathy for both Lee and Clementine. After Lee's end at the conclusion of S1, S2 takes the view of Clemetine as the active protagonist; but here, I found, was the biggest problem that I had with the new season.There were plenty of moments of surprise, intruige and danger as with the previous game, but to me it felt less like a true experience, and more like the generic cut-and-paste of other similar games. Lee tried to protect Clementine, only letting her do the dangerous bits when there was no choice - and I felt terrible letting her risk being eaten by fanatic cannibals; but here, its just the expected - Clementine's the lightest, send her off to steal something from a group of homicidal maniacs...I'm not saying this is a bad game, not at all. What I am trying to say is that, although still great, it doesn't have the same depth as the first game. Sure, you try to protect a girl with a mental disability, and don't want friends to suffer even more loss, but it's not as a leader, making hard decisions, it's as a child, instead adding some sympathy to a situation out of your hands. This is the fatal flaw: you have no control (or illusion of it at least), it doesn't matter what you say or do, people will live or die on their own, and you can't save any of them.Ep 4, 5:Part of The Walking Dead is people dying, and having to deal with the consequences of bad choices. S1 really made you feel that, whereas the first part of S2 didn't. Episodes 4 and 5 however added a lot more depth to the emotion, it wasn't just watching people die anymore, here you had the option; do I save A or B? Do I risk my life and/or everyone else's to save one person? This was the major improvement that I noticed, I really felt involved in the game again, and right at the end it was a heart wrenching choice between friendship and survival - it honestly had me tearing up."

76561198054146455,Recommended,261030,13289554,"Posted: 8 December, 2014",all,BrownieTheBrownGuy,"These games are incredible. The pure emotions that I feel towards these VIRTUAL beings is mind-blowing. This season was a well done continuation of a story that I was already in love with. Now I have a much deeper appreciation for this type of storytelling than I did before.Side note: A set of things are going to be spoiled here, so unless you've played this game already, move on.The ending for Season 1 left me in a weird state. A state of intense sadness, but also one of happiness. Not since I watched my dad play through The Last of Us had a game had such and emotional impact on me. It was a feeling that was fresh and incredibly jarring, but I loved it. After finishing Season 2, I will proudly purchase each new season of these games(if the stories are consistently good), because I cried almost as hard if not harder at the end of Season 2 than the ending of Season 1.Clementine is the first of many great things about these games. Being a part of her transition from scared little girl to hardened badass was deeply enjoyable. I cried during the flashback scene, where Clementine talks to Lee in the RV. Making the words come out of Clementine's mouth as opposed to trying to comfort her as Lee made me just break down. Running into Kenny wasn't nearly as impactful as it should have been, since the store page spoiled that for me with a thumbnail. Even with the knowledge that Kenny was going to return, I still teared up when Clementine and Kenny hugged. Talking to him made me smile wider than any other game has.Some of the choices took a lot more thought than I expected, and I regretted some of them later on. Deciding whether or not to watch Kenny beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Carver took me a second. I realized that Clem had to grow up, so she ended up watching Kenny kill Carver. I tried to keep Sarah alive, but she didn't have the strength to continue to survive after Carlos died, and almost got Jane killed. I trusted Jane a little bit too much, which made the ending even harder for me to sit through.The ending I got was one that had more emotional impact than some of the other ones, but only because of some of my previous decisions. I lost a lot of the trust I had in Kenny. I knew that he would still protect Clem, but my mind was clouded by some of the little things Kenny said and did, as well as the other group member's opinions. While Kenny and Jane were fighting, Clem picked up the gun. I sat there for a good two minutes thinking about what to do. I ended up deciding that Kenny had to go. His death was one of the most memorable moments I've ever experienced in a video game. Then it turned out that AJ was alive. As Jane stood before Clem and tried to rationalize making her kill Kenny, I realized that I'd made a huge mistake. I could see in that moment that Jane was crazy, and that if I put Clementine's life in her hands, I would ultimately end up getting her killed because of some reckless decision Jane would inevitably make. Seeing Clementine walk into a horde of walkers, her and AJ covered in guts, completely calm and driven, gave me an intense sense of pride I've only felt on a few other occasions. I was surprised to find out that I was in a very small precentage of people who were alone with AJ.After the credits rolled, I watched the other endings. Realizing that Clem could have left with Kenny and been safe made me completely reevaluate my thought process in my head. Seeing Kenny say good-bye to Clem as he let her and AJ go into Wellington made me realize something. In all of the drama with Luke and his group, the moment I realized Jane could be trusted since she knew about masking her scent from the walkers, and as Kenny lost his mind, I'd forgotten a very important lesson I'd learned in Season 1. Those who stick with you through all of it are the ones you can trust and depend on. I understood that Jane hadn't done that and was happy that I hadn't left Clem with her, but I got incredibly sad when I realized I'd let the words of other's make me lose my belief in Kenny. I'd made Clementine take the life of the one person she had left who would protect her.THAT is why I love these games so much.

I felt attached to several of the characters, and saw a lot of potential for the game, and for season three. However, I do feel that the text at the start of episode five should've read, ""This game is taiolred to how you play, just, you know, nothing you've done up to this point matters. We promise though, your choices will have meaning now."" because everything you have said and done from season 1 up to episode five leads you to the exact same spot, and in the end, nothing you did mattered until then."

It is amazing, and you need to understand it's story to play this game. Your save game can carry over into this game, which is better than the game choosing a random backstory/choices for you.The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a masterpiece, and a worthy sequel to the first game. It takes what was good about the first game, builds on it, and for the most part improves it. As far as gameplay is concerned, it is the same as the first game. It's a point and click adventure, with dialogue choices and quick time events. However, there are also some quick time events that require you to click and drag your mouse in a certain direction. These did not work so well, as my mouse would not always  register that I was dragging it, and I would have to reset it. It was annoying, but there are only about 5 instances of this in the whole game, so it's not too bad. Also, some combat scenes now require dodging, which is a fun addition. As far as the story is concerned, it's just as good as the first. The story is a lot darker than the first game (which was dark too), and it focuses on the mental stability on the group, and how people can lose their mind during the apocolypse. It's a gripping story, and I loved it. However, it is worse than the first game in some ways and better in others. For example, the villan in this game is amazing, and one of my favorite video game villans. He is played by Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs, The H8teful Eight), and he does an incredible job. The villan in the first game was ok, but not too menacing. This guy is the eqivalant to The Governor/Negan, and he is great. However, I did not feel the same connection to the group in this game like I did in the first season. In this game you play as Clemintine, and after some events that I won't spoil you join a new group. In the last game, you meet everybody over time, and learn backstory/character traits when you initally meet them. Here, you meet most of your group members at once, and you hear their stories rather than experience them first hand. They are good characters but I didn't bond with most of them as well as the first game. There are some exceptions, but I won't say who I liked better. As far as graphics go, it's about the same as the first game. It runs on Telltale's older engine but some of the textures do look a bit nicer in some areas. I did have some crashes however I am running this on an Intel graphics cars, which is clearly stated to be ""not reccomended"". I also played this with a friend on his computer (no Intel graphics) and there were no glitches of any kind. If you have Intel like me you might be able to run it, but with minor problems. In conclusion, this game is a worthy sequel and a must-play for fans of the first. It does some things better, some a bit worse but overall I love this game. I think it is worth buying at full price, but it can be very cheap during sales, if you are close to one. Either way, you should definately play this game."

When compared to Season 1, there seemed to be less player driven scenes with things to do and more story scenes where you watch the action unfold, which made is more like an animated comic than a game. There were no challenging puzzles, Season 1 had more of those and some were difficult for me. For example, in Season 1, [SPOILER ALERT] I had to go to a walkthrough game guide to get passed the part in the farmhouse with the cannibal mother in the thunderstorm. She kept shooting me dead until I got the hint on how to advance up to her. There was nothing that hard in Season 2. The story was more linear than in Season 1 as well. I played though a couple of parts with different decisions and it seemed to make little difference in the final outcome unlike Season 1 where some characters were lost and it did make a difference.  The controls continue to be fairly unresponsive, it shows all too well this is a console port and they give little thought to the PC user.The story itself was a worthy sequel to Season 1 and it fits in well with the Walking Dead franchise. Everyone who finished Season 1 were waiting to see what happened to Clem. The story is all about her, and she drives the game. One criticism was the ending. It just sort of stopped without being in a climax. There was a huge climax in Season 1 but the story in Season 2 ended in a flat sort of way. It was not even a real cliff hanger, and it felt lazy.The voice acting is terrific like in the first game, Clem is outstanding, and the rest of the cast is top notch. This story is brutal, they don't pull many punches. Get ready for heartache and to get your feelings crushed. [Spoiler Alert] When you start to like someone watch out they might not be around for very long.If you thought a zombie apocalypse might not be so bad and you could get though it without much trouble, think again. This is no place for normal human being.  That is the take home lesson from the game. When things get tough, people are not nice. It is hard to live in a world where all that you know and like gets taken away. Enjoy modern day comforts, because when the s*** hits the fan, things turn real bad in a big hurry."

Not so defenseless now, you face the apocalypse in the eyes of a child, a child that is forced to grow without ever having the chance to be exactly what she is, a child.Even though you're just a little girl, your decisions will shape the world around you in ways that you hope, and sometimes, in ways that you don't want to.This Season 2 is definitly worth it if you were a fan of the first and can be seen to be on par with it."

I enjoyed the puzzles, where they give you four or so items and you have to walk around and figure out how each of them plays into your goal at hand. If you've played other adventure games like Curse of Monkey Island, it will remind you of that style of play. For whatever reason though, they removed almost all of the puzzles in Season Two. My guess is they were running out of time and trying to wrap things up, and those puzzles take time to write and create assets/code for.400 Days is okay. Not bad, not great, just okay. Disjointed one-off stories that are super short, but entertaining for an evening.Season One is dark, but manages to feel like you're carrying a candle of hope through a rainy dark forest. You feel like there's hope at the end, even if it comes at great cost. Season Two is darker, and rips away the hope, leaving you with constant betrayal, random anger, and a sense that it was not crafted as carefully as Season One.My suggestion? If you like this type of choice-based story game, and are willing to put up with frustrating things like quick time events (hitting ""Q"" 10 times before hitting ""E"" to hold a door closed), sometimes non-sensical or mundane puzzles (flip the battery around and re-insert it into the radio), and SLOW walking characters (I'm looking at you, Season Two Clementine!) you might really enjoy this series.Personally, I found the series an enjoyable, unique experience. Some episodes were better than others, but the whole is worth the sum of its parts. I would recommend the series overall."

But, I decided to continue through the story and fell in love with the story.Season 2, now that I can officially call it over, was an incredible follow-up to S1. Not only did they bring back the many things that DID work, they took into account how dissapointed many fans of the game were with the ending of the first game, and offered more possible outcomes (to try to keep it as spoiler free as possible).If you prefer games that you are required to button mash and dodge and roll 100% of the entire game, I truly recommend you take a break from that playstyle and give this game a try.

The decisions you make have to be quick, and unlike other games where you pick what will benefit your gameplay, in here the decisions you make come straight from the heart.Personally I not only played as the character, I felt I was the character making these hard decisions. Some of the things I did came back to harm me later on in the game, however you don't try to go back and correct mistakes, you just play on like it is real life.I would personally recommend this game, and don't just buy it in sales, this game is worth every penny you buy it for and (in my opinion) is worth a lot more than what they are asking for."

U try it once u try it twice, then u go find another. Like all serials this game tryes to keep you interested all way trhu and it succeeds with that but what i realised about this game is that ur ""decisions"" doesnt affects any actual events, it only changes the perception of whats happened. U can help one of ur crew u can help another but in a big picture all of that doesnt really matters u'll end up in a same place, i'm not blaming a game for that coz u cant really make a game where every decision leads to a dozens of a new ones its just impossible. Finally i think that many of characters are overreacting, yes its a mess going up and everyday its got even worse but i think theres a limit after wich u should put a bullet in ur own head or just stop reacting on everything like heroes do, i think after that limit u should feel nothing and just proceed with no emotions, thats my personal opinion. Also theres a lot of paranoia in this game, its scratches on every corner wich is not surprising but still i think its a bit too much of it. Finally - i would recommend this game as a good time-killer, it has a good story, good voice acting, this game can keep ur emotious if thats what u are searching for. 9/10 i would say..."

Maybe it was because I sort of already prepped myself to lose them just from playing the first game. But also because they kept rethreading character tropes - here's the 'Kenny guy', here's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, here's the motherly figure etc. They even put in a token black guy who honestly does not do anything plot-relevant, as a way to callback to Lee, I swear.I missed the 400 Days characters. They had more character development from that game than the new cast here. It is such a waste and a pity. The one we do get, is not the least compelling, but made me wish we got the rest.The one time I felt the same emotional pangs of the first Season, was because there is a scene here that is a DELIBERATE callback to Season 1. That means the devs knew they couldn't topped Season 1.I recommend this game because, like watching a TV series, you gotta take the bad seasons with the good.

I have to admit, though, after plating the 2nd season here on steam, I have fallen in love with it and telltale games. I love the fact that your decisions follow you into the second season, even though I didn’t experience it. I love the fact that every decision that you make has an impact on the story. Too many games now-a-days have been tailored so that that no matter what decisions you make, you are the hero who saves everybody. It is unrealistic, especially in this universe. I love the fact that these devs have made a game in which your decisions have lasting consequences and they are not easy decisions to make. Amazing job Telltale!

Playing as Clem is a very unique experience, not only because it's rarely done in other works, but because of your relation with her from TWD Season 1. As Lee in season 1, I often found myself trying to teach, but also protect Clem from the worst of the zombie apocalypse. But now, I feel compelled to not hide anything from her because growing up fast is what's going to keep her alive.Instead of being a guardian and leader, the role has switched to being a lesser member of the group that is not as strong or as capable as others. However, therein lies the beauty of the game. There is so much more importance in dealing with other characters and managing group cohesion. Season 2 highlights how important relationships are and knowing what to say to certain people at the right time- something most games seem to ignore."

Every choice you make has an impact on something, wether it be minimal or huge. Some choices can also be really hard for you to make because you get so attached to some characters.

I can tell you there are many different outcomes of Episode 2, so things you say/do ACTUALLY have weight. The story was quite compelling and I guess the only drawback is that you are a super-humanly mature 11 year old who is asked (by adults) to make adult decisions everyday.But I love how while reading dialogue, I would think in my head ""I would say ____"" and that option would usually be there.No other game makes me ready for the Zombie Apoc!

I'm glad to say that it delivers, coming back with fantastic writing and with an improved enginge and gameplay (my only two gripes with the first game), but it's pacing is just a little... off.After the events of season one, you end up playing as Clementine about a year and a half later. She's growing up, and is learning to take care of herself in a world gone to hell. It's fantastic to play as her, as she was the driving force of everything from season 1, and to see her growing up was a great call on Telltale's part.The situations you'll find yourself in are much different, and more difficult than the first season. Rather than playing as a full-grown man, you play as a little girl now- so normal things like axing a walker is more of a struggle- and people treat you like a child. Whether or not you go with that, or use it to your advantage is up to you. There are more choices in dialogue than agree or disagree like in the first game- you can guilt people, or take people by surprise with how the apocolypse has shaped you.While I didn't connect with any of the characters as much as I did in season 1- they're still all great for the most part. The voice acting and writing are once again phenominal, and there are even more dire situations you'll get into with them. There's even a clear cut antagonist this time around who is legitimately threatening.Now I mentioned the pacing is wierd this time around. It's not all bad, but the feeling is just completely different from season 1. There is much more action, almost to the point of buring out, and the last two episodes are completely different from the first three. I obviously don't want to spoil it, but the story just kind of falls flat at that point for me. There are multiple endings this time, but none of them come even close to the punch-in-the-gut ending that was in season 1.This doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the game by any means though, I really enjoyed it. It just didn't have the same weight that the first season did. The main driving force here is still Clementine though, so if you're invested in the first season- pick this up, it's still a great experience all around."

The way season 1 ended, legit made me cry--and only one other game has ever managed that. Season 2, is just as good and with a few added game mechanics, and seemingly more choices, I literally have no complaints.The game is fantastic. It feels very much like The Walking Dead. I've never read the comics, but it is just as intense as watching the TV show--moreso, even, because you're actually making choices that definitely impact how the story goes. And that is one of the reasons I love this game series so much: Your choices actually matter. And they are not always easy to make either. The game does a fantastic job of placing you into the situation where you have to make questionable decisions either for your own survival, or for the group you're with.I highy recomend this game.

I will probably flush it out once I finished it completely.In a nutshell, this game is fantastic. It is intense, supenseful, heartfelt, and gut-wrenching. This game hits you with so many feels, you don't know how to react sometimes. I have never played a game where I would openly yell and gesture at the happenings of the game. From my critique of Clementine'ssuturing capabilitiesto the suspensefulrevelation of Walter's partner,I've been on the edge of my seat almost the entire time playing.I feel comfortable with my decisions. That is to say I don't necessarily have a nagging feeling of whether it was a good choice or not, as I did in Season 1. One choice can flow nicely into another choice, allowing your mindset regarding the situation at hand to be properly presented throughout the dialogue.There may be some minor character model suttering from time to time, especially on walkers, but aside from that, this game is perfect.10/10"
,Recommended,261030,29439792,Posted: 23 January,all,Takeover,"The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a significant improvement from the first game. First up, graphics. The graphics themselves are okay, there are better looking games and better looking cel-shaded games out there, but I have no real issue with the graphics here, they get the job done and everything generally is pretty detailed. Animations are also improved from the first game, but it's obvious Telltale Games needs to put more time into them.Sound and voice acting is pretty well done. Besides a few individuals, everyone does a great job here.Gameplay here is somewhat lacking, compared to your average game, but this is a visual novel more than anything. Story here reigns supreme more than anything else in this game. The game picks up a few months after the end of The Walking Dead (season 1), and you play as Clementine. TWDS2 has much tougher decisions than the first game, and more of them. One of my issues with the first game was that many decisions were black and white. Kill this man or save everyone, etc, etc. I won't go into much detail, as to not spoil you, but much of the decisions in this game have, and will continue to, divide the community.I would HIGHLY recommend you play The Walking Dead (season 1) before playing this one, but it's not required. You can, more or less, pick some of the decisions from the first game as you play through this one, but understand that many of them will also be randomly generated, and you may not like what you get. Beyond that, this game is solid, has a great story, and can jerk a tear and pull on the ol' heartstrings more than once."

How interesting could a game be in which you would play a child, would you still be able to influence situations like in season 1 or would you just be given some crayons and be told to ""play over there""?After playing the first 2 episodes all my worries were gone regarding this: Clementine is a great protagonist, mature beyond her years and easisy as relatable as Lee. And Telltale once again holds no punches and the stuff Clem has to deal with is in many ways even worse than what Lee got on his plate in season 1. It's actually pretty sad and depressing how much this girl has to suffer.About the game itself: the episodes are even shorter than those of season 1 and there is even less ""gameplay"" than in the first season (The Walking Dead is now basically has become an interactive movie). This would not be a problem if the story itself would've been as thight as that of season 1: however, while there are amazing scenes, there are also quite some illogical plot twists that seem to have no other function than to shock. It's 1,5 years after the apocalypse: you would've expected that after all that time some people had stepped over their ego's to actually work together once in a while, but no, it's one childish conflict after another...Also, the rate with which new characters are introduced and killed off is so high that, in combination with very short episodes, the player barely has time to get acquainted to some, thus lessening the emotional impact of the hard choices you have to make.Still, even with these story issues, season 2 still was pretty good and like I stated earlier, a must play for fans of the first season. For me all that remains is waiting for the inevitable season 3, all the while hoping Telltale will clean up their act, focus their story some more and once again reach the greatness of season 1."

Not to say Clementine isn't a well developed character, I just feel like as a child she has less content to her. It's a TellTale game so it plays more like a movie with some player input than an actual game, and if you're looking for a good story and not much else go for it because it definitely has a lot of story. I'm just not a fan of games that play like this. Much like the show after the main cast was mostly or entirely gone I stopped feeling attached to the characters in the game especially since many of them were in and out like a revolving door.

It's the main reason.Another one - it's just another ""NOT a point and click movie game""from TaleTale. They should invent something new or switch back to comedy. At least it's fun, while drama here is boring.Back to the logic. It probably came from the TV Series ( I do hope that comix series are better), but it is applied here.The dead have several rules how they should exists:Rule 1 - walker can kill people only when they look at them or hear them. Or someone else look, how they kill the target. So if you are all alone in the room and you will turn back to the walker - everything is good. Also walkers can't come closed than several steps from you.Rule 2 - Behind you back walkers can do anything. This include running with the speed of light without breaking the sound barrier or, more realistic, teleportation. This mean that you can't run from the walker. When you look at them they will move very slowly moaning something, but if you will run - they will still keep the distance. No exceptions. You can't run without hurting them. And then they can teleport and crawl to you.Rule 3 - The amount of strength, intellect and cunning the walkers have is proportional to the amount of intellect the target have. If some scientist will start some experiments with the walkers - they will be able to break walls and find way out of any labyrinth without an error. And if you have only one straight line on your gray matter - you will be fine even behind chalk circle.Rule 4 - Walkers exists in one worldwide grid with ability to communicate between each other. This grid cover whole Earth with more points inside cities and less in the wild. But there will be several walkers inside any taken square kilometer. If they are killed - others will fill the gap by teleporting there and providing patrol to check who the hell mess with their stuff. It's the only possible explanation why walkers lay down or walk in the places, where you can't find people in our time."

Every character other than Clemintine is annoying and I have zero empathy for their plights. I'm not finding myself attached to any of the characters and again, almost every decision made ends with the same result, just a different choice of dialog and character reactions / temporary demenor.If there's an option to save someone, chances are that person is going to die very shortly, regardless... so it's best to just forget about the weak and save yourself... I suppose this would be an appropriate mindset during an apocalypse but for a video game it makes for very unintersting twists [In this game's case, no twists at all] and there's really nothing to discuss with other individuals because the outcome is the same for everyone in the end.Here's an example:56% of players decided to pick up the litter off the ground.... what a compelling and plot changing decision... simply amazing...I should replay this episode and NOT pick up the piece of garbage, maybe someone will trip on it and get ravaged by a zombie! [This would be an amazing turn out but in the case of this game's lazy direction, it won't matter and you will simply just leave a piece of garbage on the ground and the decision will be inconsequential either way]Again, if you really want to know what happens to Clem, buy it, if not, you can probably just check out some videos on youtube and get the same experience."

What i got was being forced into playing as an eleven year old girl who is treated by every single adult in the game as the responsible adult in charge.THE NEXT PARAGRAPH HAS SPOILERS ON EPISODE 1Here is an example of one of the things that broke the immersion in this game for me by being both illogical and ruining my attempt at role playing an eleven year old girl. In the first episode you are bitten by a dog and some people find you. They are understandably worried that you might turn into a zombie so they leave you in a shed overnight to see if you turn into a zombie. As far as i could see the best option would be to just wait the night out and get medical attention from the peope the next day when it was established that i was not a zombie. Instead the game rail roads you into breaking into the peoples house and stealing medical supplies. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE, i mean clementine wasnt going to drop dead from a dog bite not being treated for one bloody night. Heres an idea. How about the players are given a choice to either stay in the shed the night or break into the house and get the medical supplies. If you decide to stay in the shed overnight. Then you end up having to fight off like 6 zombies in a part quick tim event part puzzle sequence. Zombies are trying to break into the shed from various sides you have to make use of the various tools and containers around the shed to barricade them out and fight them off. If my choices actually changed events and i had not been forced to go along with illogical demented courses of action perhaps i would enjoy this game."

I couldn't stop playing Season 1: I couldn't wait to be DONE playing Season 2!Gone are the interesting characters and complicated group dynamics.  Forgotten are the characters of pure evil or out-and-out insanity.  Instead we have a set of interchangable, ambiguous, and largely forgettable ensemble supporting cast types who suffer from weak and inconsistent characterization.A frequent theme is that a character reacts very negatively to Clem initially, I insult/mock/critize that character at every available dialogue opportunity, and then said character has a bizarre change-of-heart conversation with no apparent motive designed to make the character seem more likeable RIGHT BEFORE some kind of momentous decision about whether or not Clem will help that character.  Conversely, a character who has only had positive interactions with Clem will turn on her for frankly unbelievable and fairly rediculous reasons.This game has also set the annoyance factor, on a scale of 1 to 10, to 11!  Just about everyone is weak and/or stupid and/or delusional.  Approximately 90% of the adults in-game have no problem risking the life of a 11-year old girl over and over again.  They are unable to create a plan, follow a plan, improvise in an emergency, or resolve conflict.Ultimately this game made me feel cheated out of the money I spent on it and was so bad that I will not be puchasing Season 3.

I am a huge fan of the Walking Dead from the TV show to the novels. When I first played Season One and saw the negative remarks about only having the appearance of choice, I simply shoved them off thinking that the choices would actually show their consequences in Season Two. They didn't; there was no bearing whatsoever from Season One. Furthermore I must say that, as far as decision-making goes, Season Two delivered almost as bad as Season One. The only way it didn't is at the very end of Episode 5, where you as the player decide between two very different destinations and people to follow. But in all other matters, the decisions you make only do one of two things (or both): mildly change the dialogue between you and other survivors or delay a major happening from taking place. For all of the game except the end as I mentioned above, in no other way do you mold the story (who lives or dies, where you go, etc.). So I guess we'll have to wait for Season Three to see what happens, assuming there will be one. I understand that as a game like this goes further, it only becomes  more and more difficult to tie all the knots together of the decisions made. Perhaps that has much to do with it. So for that reason, I don't recommend The Walking Dead: Season One or Two as games.I do want to put in a good word though. As a STORY, Telltale Games has done great. It is very dramatic, emotional, and thought-provoking. It really encapsulates the struggles of living in a zombie apocolypse.One last relatively small matter: they definitely need more zombie models. You just see the same dead faces all the time, and it's very bland. They really ought to invest just a little bit more to make each walker unique."

I proudly admit I loved Season 1, that was awesome and inspired, a tightly woven tale from episode 1 to 5. Season 2 however developed and progressed a lot like the tv show (imo) which is why I didn't enjoy it as much...Clem has basically become Carl.I dig the idea of Clem growing up, maturing, and beginning to take care of herself. She definitely is wise beyond her years which is great for her story arc. Yet I am perplexed at how often the other surviviors...grown adults.... are asking Clem to constantly risk her life, sneak somewhere dangerous, operate heavy machinery, drive a car, decide who lives and who dies, talk and negotiate with crazy people, find exactly what they need to stop a zombie horde from busting through an enclosure, etc... I get that Clem is the protagonist and must be involved in every action ( it is a video game) but the scenarios for why she has to do it versus someone else could of been better written.I unfortunately had no connection with the majority of the survivors we meet this season. Maybe the reality of the world has made most of the characters unlikable but the infighting is unbearable. There seemed to be arguments and disagreements every 5 minutes. The group is toxic and the only character that makes any sense in my opinion is Jane who operates best as a loner. In terms of the story I found it to be a lot like the TV show plot, especially any episode featuring Carver and his prison-like settlement. He was basically a typical one dimensional bad guy who you knew would torment the team for as long as it took to get his comeuppance.In terms of glitches whats up with the white screen crash? That happened many times during my gameplay. I had to shrink the game into windowed mode just to finish episode 5. I never had one crash with Season 1 not sure whats going on with Season 2. Overall Season 2 is a good game but just like the TV show it meandered in circles, not having a bigger picture or larger goal brought it down a notch, especially when compared to Season 1."

According to Metacritic(http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two---a-telltale-games-series),it's:#64 Best PC Game of 2013#14 Most Shared PC Game of 2013Does The Walking Dead: Season Two - A Telltale Games Series live up to it's predecessor? Will this still be a journey worth taking? Given the new improvements as well? Well, for me, this is really, really hard to say.I will be comparing season 1(s1) with season 2(s2) on certain elements of the game.We'll start off with the controls.The Controls are easy however the developers have decided to make some changes:Conversation menuThe conversation menu is now a 4 box optionArrow key QTEThey've also introduced a new Arrow key QTE eventGun/shooting mechanicsThey introduce a new aiming cursorNew interaction modeThere is also a new interaction mode which you are required to hold the mouse before able to perform an action.Visually, It seems like its the same game engine however I noticed less blocky objects and much finer/cleaner art style. This time around, players will be introduced to new settings notably, ice/snow.Other than that, there still isn't any new mechanics being introduced. It's still a story driven game depending on your choices you make.The StoryS2 puts you in role of Clementine, who's a few years older. She remembers the lessons thought by Lee from S1 and follows them however things started off badly with the death of a group member and following that event, things just went south. She meets new group@people on a bad start and depending on your gamplay from S1, you may meet characters from S1 here. So it turns out that the group who you're with has a history. History soon catches up to them and normally, it ends badly. Everything from here onwards, just ends badly. No matter what you do. period.The developers have decided to add in multiple endings/different outcome depending on your choice this round. It's great but it comes with a great cost of character development.My personal viewI got a shock myself when I completed the game within the same day. The opening scene left me hanging with questions. Did they wanted to kill off S1 characters? The moment with Christa was so short and meaningless. Nothing developed. No oppurtunity was taken to build on that tragic death. Nothing. Bang. Camp. Rain. Ambushed. Lost. Bye Christa. T.TMany have mentioned that S2 is intense. I agree, S2 certainly makes you feel more intense because you're often thrown into in-group fighting@drama at the cost of story telling. Unlike in S1, your choice really did matter or at least, it did a difference. In S2, no matter what you say or do, people just die. At one point of the game, I just gave up on the people around me. Look, if you all want to kill each other, go ahead and be done about it. I am not going to care anymore because I had it with all the drama. If i had a gun in my hand, I would have either killed them all by myself or kill myself. There's too much drama and so little moment where you get to know a chracter apart from the few ""key"" characters. There is little engagement moments. The focus is so much more on the group-in-fighting.That was already a turn off point for me but to make it even bad, I had to deal with the 4 control changes mentioned above:Conversation menuIt was a glaring change and one that I did not welcome with open arms because it took away my ability to respond on the fly using keyboard (1,2,3,4). What you have now is 4 box and a ton of words in them.Arrow key QTEThey've also introduced a new Arrow key QTE. I don't understand the need/introduction to this new game mode. What value or does this enhance the gaming experience apart from button mashing? I also have a bad experience with season 2's QTE? In Certain moments in the game if you miss that 2 second option to click on an object, you're done.Gun/shooting mechanicsThe gun/shooting mechanics have also been changed. What used to be a simple aim sight now comes with an aiming cursor with weird stability.New interaction modeThere is also a new interaction mode which you are required to hold the mouse before able to perform an action.The walking dead has always been about a story about people. In S2, it looks like main focus was on the individual differences instead of the group. The thought about having Clementine abandoning half of the group of survivor, for me that was insanely stupid because in S1, thats not what my Lee Everett thought her. I personally dislike the direction of where S2 is taking because of S1 experience. If it wasn't for S1, I might have liked S2 a little more.In S2, your choice only matters when it comes to saving Sarah. Other than that, you have nothing to decide on. I knew the threath of the russian kid posses and I wanted to disspose him off from the group quickly but I was not given any option to do so and in the end Clementine got shot. The group wouldn't give me use a rifle why would they give a rifle to the russian kid?? Seems like they wanted to make Kenny the ""bad"" character or the scapegoat and kill off every S1 character - or - make Clementine abandon all S2 characters. huh...I hope the developers will remove all the fancy/redundant control changes, especially the QTE arrow changes. That's not enhancing the gaming experience. Focus on the story and character development. Focus on engagement. Give us choices that matters with consequences. Expand on the gameplay based on the choice/give us an option to decide what to do. That's where the value comes from. Maybe it's time to introduce some other new mechanic to the game play or take on a new approach.If there's going to be a season 3 with the same focus on in-group fighting, random meaningless group member death's, I am sorry, I am done. Clementine is still a likeable character so there's still hope to develope her else please spare her character from future titles. S2 really killed off S1, Clementine & Kenny's character.My Summary:The Walking Dead: Season Two - A Telltale Games Series still focuses on players choice however in actual case, it seems nothing really matters. The story is more dramatic, individual conflicts within the group is the focus rather than the group survivalbility. They've added in multiple endings which is interesting and I am left wondering if there would be future titles and how would things turn out/gel together. At this point, I am kind of dissapointed with S2's story and controls.From a S1 player myself, I am not keen on recommending it other S1 players. You may be dissapointed however if you have never played S1, you probably can try this as it gives you a whole new experience - no other story telling games can. So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for The Walking Dead: Season Two - A Telltale Games Series is a 6/10."

Probably not. *Potential Spoilers*I guess I should start this review with the pros.First pro is the story. Some call it bad, I call it good because it was something that kept me engaged, something I would not want to stop watching. What I did like most about the story was that it showed you how far things have gone downhill since the whole thing started.In the first episode, your friend dies because of your carelessness, his pregnant wife loses the baby and sixteen months later you and her get attacked by scavengers (her fate left unknown), you get thrown in a lake a innocent looking dog tears the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you, people find you and think you are bitten by a walker, lock you in a shed, you sneak out to get medical supplies from THEIR house, go through a very painful sequence of helping your wound, get attacked by a walker in the shed halfway through stitching yourself up, and after most of the group (two of them, a doctor and a another pregnant lady don't) trusts you, you go out to find food and have a choice to either save a bitten guy from the group or save the not bitten guy.This game gets intense, but like all Telltale games, they only allow you to say what you want and walk around to look at♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a few decisions put in there.For any more pros, I would say that some characters are good, they give you more decisions to do stuff, like shoot someone or watch some guy die. I like Clementine, but I will say one thing, there are points where I believe her voice acting could have a little more work, but nothing to make me hate her. Kenny comes back, but he is still a♥♥♥♥♥♥ More about that later.But anyway, the story is great. Later on, there are more characters, more death, more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, blah blah blah.Now the cons:The decisions from Season 1 and 400 Days barely count towards something, mostly just dialogue and, in 400 Days' case, a few five second cameos.The only decisions that matter here are the ones in the last episode. The others just mean different dialogue and maybe a death. But what you have to remember with these games is that they will not go through the trouble to make different outcomes if certain people live or die or if you make a ""big"" decision. Those outcomes only really happen in the last episode, because they only have to change things for the last bits of the episode.Another thing to remember: your character can't die unless you fail a QTE. This isn't Heavy Rain. If you die, you start over. If you say something wrong to♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off, maybe they will just act differently towards you, maybe they will hit you, it just means a different mark on your face that is useless to the plot. Anyway, I might come back to things about the decisions, but for now, moving on.The Walking Dead Season One did really well. It was good, because it was something after Jurassic Park, so they were basically comparing something good to something bad. They probably didn't have a great budget for TWD S1, but they probably had a huge budget for Season Two. What did they do with it? Spent it on different voice actors and different areas and characters. Sounds normal right?It is, but here is the thing. There were no new animations. In the first game, I could understand, they had a few mocapped animations, and the rest were created. But with such a great budget, if they had one, they could've made new, better animations. Also, way too many characters, too many to care about, you couldn't even figure out which one you liked the most before they died or went off the deep end.And there were glitches. Like I am talking a man holding an invisible gun as the actual gun is floating a few feet away from their hands.Maybe if they hadn't worked on The Wolf Among Us while creating TWD S2, they might've made better animations. But with one studio and 180 employees, I would not suggest doing two projects at once. But that's just me.Now I know I am just ♥♥♥♥♥ing, but it did annoy me. I remembered when I started TWD S2, I got Last of Us Remastered, and let me tell you, TLOU is ten times better than this. It didn't have decisions, but it had one hell of a story, all of the characters were great, and it actually engaged you in the action. And yes, while Naughty Dog had more employees, they were not working on anything else. And unlike TWD S1, TWD S2 did not make me cry once. TLOU made me cry multiple times, so did TWD S1. TWD S2 just had so many characters that you couldn't care for all of them. Too much of one thing is bad for you, and for this one, it was characters."

While I kinda enjoyed the story it became a bit boring just watching the story unfold without much input or action and as I progressed, it felt less like a game and more like a TV show. Sure, there were decisions to make along the way, but most of them were just about taking sides with any given character, I'm not sure how reaching a particular decision would actually affect the outcome or progression of the story.I'm glad I only paid a small price for this game (around £5), I'd be pretty p***ed off if I'd paid full price, especially when I completed it in around 9 hours and it's not the sort of game I'd bother playing through more than once."

This time, we play as Clementine, the girl we saved in the previous season. The story is just awesome, graphics are better from the previous Season & Clementine makes you feel like the bravest person in the whole Damn world.The new guys we meet feel like a FAMILY and after the episodes end,it'll leave you thinking about the choices you made and hoping to do something different.The story of all the episodes that came out till now is just super awesome and fun but the only thing that I feel is bad about this game is that the episodes are too short,but it doesn't mean that the game is bad....I would just gift this game to several of my friends only if I could afford that much expense.*UPDATE*In the end of the last episode,I had to make a very difficult choice,which I made with the help of ehh,some spoilers and even then,I had to think about that choice by my heart...it felt like this was for real and when I made my choice,I was really CRYING along with Clem because the ending broke my heart and I couldn't stop myself.This game is the best game that I own and the bonus offered i.e. the 5 alternative endings would make me play this game again and again and again.....THANK YOU TELLTALE FOR SUCH A GREAT PROJECT.....looking forward to the next season and the other projects too... :)"

,Recommended,261030,8099469,"Posted: 17 December, 2013",all,JLB,"For those who are The Walking Dead veterans (and by that I mean a good lot of people) - it's a decent followup. It's got all the pros you expect coming from a good Telltale game, and it will deliver where needed.However, I feel like I should point out  various issues with the game. As of right now - several hours after launch - it crashes on occasions, animations are often goofy or just freeze up, stuff clips, stuff doesn't draw properly, the UI has actually gotten worse (not utterly unusable, but much less comfortable) and in some QTE sequences it's really hard to figure out what you should do. It's rather shoddy on the development point of view and might just♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, but thankfully this is THE kind of game that can be forgiven for that. Hopefully it'll be patched, because I can't take a scene seriously when a character just freezes up for three seconds."

If you didn't play Season 1, why are you looking at the reviews for the 2nd season?The story in my opinion is better and more desperate than Season 1. One of the different endings had me in tears, incredibly manly tears that is. I normally don't react emotionally to fictional stories, but some stories just get you man.The 400 Days DLC for Season 1 is recommended but not needed for this season.9/10 is my score. They improved some gameplay aspects that I didn't like in the first game.

This game was so intense! Gotta say it was a lot more lively than the previous season, fantastic!The Ending:I have mixed feelings about the ending. Like the show, I hate the unexplained ending. I wish they wrapped it up a bit better than they did, no matter what ending you choose. Which brings the part I like about it. I love how there are 4 alternate endings, between staying with Kenny, going alone in the Wellington base, staying with Jane, or going all by yourself and AJ in the wilderness.Future of season 3:I think this creates great opportunities for the future of season 3. It's going to be a lot of work, creating about 5 different story lines. I will be very impressed if all the different paths don't line up to the same story again. It would be so cool to have 4 or 5 different teams working on different storylines. This would make it more interesting and also give more game time for the next season, as there would be multiple ways to play. People will actually start using other saves!! These 2 seasons had very little reason to go back and change a decision. So yeah, multi storyline game would be amazing. (I said 5 storylines, because if you choose Jane, you also get to choose to let a family join you or not, which can tailor the storyline as well)My choice of ending:I personally chose to stay with Jane and let the family in, but I think all the choices will make interesting individual stories. Except for choosing to go alone into Wellington, I don't see much opportunity with that, except for the overused idea. New group that doesn't trust you at first, slowly gain their trust, eventually become one of the main people of the group, have them rely on you, group starts to fall apart, people die, people start betraying each other, more conflict, eventually group completely crumbles and everyone either dies or splits up. That's the only story I see coming from Wellington, which seems to be exactly what happened in season 2.Missing Information from the story:So, there's a lot of things that end up unanswered and I don't see being answered in the future. Not talking about the cliffhanger at the end of the season here. I'm talking about what happened to many characters.Let's start with Sarah,k, so like, we never really found out what was wrong with her. When we first saw her in the house after finding the new group, we knew she seemed a little mentally messed up. I thought their would be an explanantion, so I played on waiting for one. Later, Carlos mentions to Clem that she ""has been through a lot"" ""If she saw the world, she wouldn't be able to handle it"" stuff like that. He makes it seem like she has never seen the walkers before, which is obviously not true once you have finished the season. Considering she was with Carver before with the rest, and they made a big escape and travelled quite some distance, its clear she has seen walkers before and knows they are dangerous. Did she have anxiety? some other mental disorder? Like that other time when her and Luke were in the trailer and Clem and Jane go and save her. Why did she not want to get out and escape? It couldn't have been because her dad died, that's not a good enough reason to sit and accept death. Idk what it is with her, but I never fully understood her issue.ChristaWhat happened to her???!?!?! They kept making references back to her with Clem saying ""I was with Christa"" ""I wonder if Christa is there"" stuff like that. I really hope they bring her back in season 3 or something, because they completely left us in the dark with no signs of what happened to her.JaneShe was also kind of weird. Why was she so quiet when they first met her. Why did she refuse to talk for like a day, then all of a sudden she joins in the group like she was always a part of it. I kind of understand why she didn't want to save Sarah multiple times, because she experienced stuff like that with her sister. But I still don't think that's a reason to not help her, multiple times. Idk, I wouldn't be able to justify it if I was her, but I'm not her, so it's a mystery to me.The RussiansThey didn't have a very important part in the story at all. All they really did was hold the group up. Then Arvo just took them to the half-built house. Other than that, they didn't seem to have much purpose, I think a little more information on why these people straight from Russia were there and why they didn't speak English or anything like that. Any info on them at all would have been nice.Carver/BillStill don't understand why he was insane. I kind of got that he like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Rebecca or something, because why else would he keep saying it's his baby. Idk, he was just a weird character. A little more backstory to him would be nice. Because Clem keeps asking about him and the past group and they just seem to always tell her ""it's not important"" ""it doesn't matter"". like, IT ♥♥♥♥ING DOES MATTER.RebeccaThe only confusing part about her was how she turned. My only guess is that the pills were infected or something and caused her to turn. Other than that, I have no idea how she got infected.MikeWhy was he such an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the first time he was introduced then the next day turns into an instant member of the group and turns super friendly. He reminded me or Lee.Bonnie and MikeStill don't know why they decided to take off with Arvo still. Without Clem and Jane at least. I would think they would at least take Jane, because she had the same idea as them, all of them were against Kenny's idea.The guy that stole Clem's backpack at the very beginning. That group seemed to be part of Carver's people as well, but again, no information about them at all.LukeActually, I'm pretty sure he was one of the only round characters that actually had some meaning. Only thing was, HE COULD HAVE LIVED. CLEM COULD HAVE KICKED THAT ZOMBIE OFF, LUKE HIMSELF COULD HAVE KICKED IT OFF. HE COULD HAVE LIVED DAMMIT.Sam, the dog and the family.There was a point after that encouter to ask Carver (I think) if he knew about the dog. I clicked on a different option and I didn't get a choice to ask about it again. I wish I could have. Turns out it wasn't his family, but that left some information out for a while. I think it would have been way cooler to develope with the dog more. It was a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way for him to get out of the story, dying in spikes. I wish we had the option to just let Clem allow the dog to have all the food. Maybe gain his trust and have him as a companion, because he did seem to show a lot of compassion towards Clem. I thought the idea of adding animal characters was great, the human characters are starting to be reused and dull. So a dog would have been great to add onto the story. Any animal would have, including the racoons in the civil war place, they grabbed my attention. Yeah, you get the idea, any round developed animal character would be great.SaritaShe didn't seem very relevant either. But I didn't like how the very end of the episode you got to choose to cut off her arm or kill the zombie. I think most players cut off the arm to try and save her, but then the very beginning of the next episode, she gets horded and just dies right away anyway!! I guess it makes sense because of the loud♥♥♥♥♥scream she gave. But still, that choice was irrelevant then.Conclusion:I don't see much that could be done for season 3 that would be new and exciting. It seems like it's all been done now. They have already started to recycle characters, groups, dramatic decisions, everything like that. However, again, with all these alternate endings, perhaps they can do more with the story now. We'll just have to wait in see, best of luck to the amazing creators of this game10/10"

As someone who is part of a large network of those who have mental disabilities like anxiety, depression, and being on the spectrum, this was just insulting. At the very least, she could have died fighting, not like Captain Kirk.The dialogue, visuals, and atmosphere were all SO PERFECT up until that point, which just destroyed everything it had going for it. If you want to argue ""well, it's REALISTIC!"" then please, don't even bother because if we can suspend our disbelief that there are literal WALKING DEAD and that a CHILD SURVIVED AMONGST THEM FOR AS LONG AS SHE HAS, I think we could buy a person with anxiety or on the spectrum would manage to find ways to cope with the strength of others and be able to live with their disability under those circumstances.

Sadly, Season 2 fails on just about every level to surpass or even meet the original's quality. Telltale's Walking Dead now suffers from the same issues that the TV show is burdened by: overall terrible writing with characters who have very generic motivations who get killed off when the writers run out of ideas for their storylines. Unlike the original, the characters have no clear direction or plans for survival beyond finding food and shelter for the day; while this is reasonably realistic, its also incredibly boring. A domino effect of hurt feelings goes through this story, with characters behaving erratically (often contradicting their previous motivations and ignoring friendships) because other characters were behaving erratically. Everytime something bad happens, Clementine has to save the day while the adults bicker and threaten to kill each other. Most character's actions in these episodes are illogical and your choices and actions have even less consequences than in the original game.Even with Telltale behind the wheel, TWD: Season 2 has already fallen into the shallow strides set by the TV show. While I still recommend the original, Season 2 is a decidedly phoned in 8 hours of ""gameplay"" that isn't worth wasting your time on."

Great characters, choices, events, and especially wonderful writing...all the way up to the end of Episode 3.  Episode 4 and 5 feel like they were created by an entirely different team, one that relied less on great character developement, but more on shock value and shoddy plot movement.Characters make choices that are completely counter to their personalities and values set in episodes 1-3, and feel like the choices they make are to move the plot along, rather than based on what the characters would actually do.I also understand that in these games, choice is often more an illusion, and the repercussions of my decisions are more likely to be superficial or non-existant...BUT in these last few episodes, I found myself not being able to express Clementine as I would like, finding my opinion non existent in a sea of very similar conversation choices.In the end, it felt like Telltale sacrificed good characters development to support a more shocking plot. These beautifully built characters end up doing things in the story that is counter to their personality in order to offer twists and turns to the plotline.  The reason I play The Walking Dead is for the great storytelling - and you can't do that without good characters."
76561197986527965,Not Recommended,261030,30767827,Posted: 27 March,all,Dasbooby,"Walking Dead: Season 2 is an alright game that is let down by the things that made the first season good.Season 2 suffers from the same problem as season 1, you're given the illusion of choice rather than making choices that actually matter or impact the story.  Let a character die?  Oh well.  Save a character?  They'll barely be visible until they're killed off later in the same episode or the next one.  Make someone hate you, doesn't really matter.  Make someone like you, doesn't really matter.  Take the middle road, doesn't really matter.  Hey, we have the option of doing A or B, what do you think Clementine?  Well, turns out it doesn't matter what you think because you're going to go wherever the game tells you to go, do whatever the game tells you to do, or watch events happen in pretty much the same way despite what you tried to do.  The only exception to this comes in the last 5-10 minutes of the 5th episode, where the choices you make during that 5-10 minutes alone determines your final ending.  Now while the lack of choice bothered me somewhat in season 1, I was able to get over it because season 1 had other strengths that made it good.  The problem with season 2 is that many of these strengths are much weaker this time around.The biggest problems with season 2 are the plot and stories.  A good drama has a natural flow and has characters making decisions that for the most part make sense, but maybe they face opposition or some long term plan comes to fruition against them or something unexpected but still sensical happens.  A bad drama has a poor flow and usually involves characters making terrible decisions for the sole purpose of making terrible decisions or having nonsensical things occur to drive the drama or shock the viewer.  Season 2 is full of bad drama and the game makes this very clear in its opening scene of episode 1.  There is no reason that Clementine wouldn't have been in the same bathroom as the 2 other characters she's traveling with.  The only reason she goes into a separate bathroom is to drive the plot.  This kind of bad drama continues throughout the game.  You'll constantly be asking yourself questions about why these nonsensical events are occuring.  It probably hits its biggest bad drama moment when the group runs into a Russian gang at the end of episode 4.  Yes, a Russian gang.  All I could do was shake my head at how poorly written this part was.  The Russians have no clue the group is coming that way, yet they have an ambush set in the middle of nowhere for them.  Why was that Russian dude hiding medicine/drugs in a trashcan in the middle of nowhere all by himself?  Why are they a 3+ hour walk from the cabin that they stay in?  The best part is, no matter what “choices” you make throughout that entire ordeal, it doesn't matter.  I could go on and on about the bad drama, but then I'd be mentioning most of the game.The game is also much shorter than the first one, which wouldn't bother me if the quality was still as high, but it's not.  Due to the much shorter length, characters often don't feel as well developed and fleshed out.  Some of the characters that are actually given face time are decently written and likable (Luke & Jane), but other characters are pretty much one dimensional and forgettable (Alvin and Carlos), or are killed off 10 minutes after meeting them.  Another problem is that most of the major characters will randomly go off on you for no real reason at some point, no matter how much they supposedly like you.  Almost all of them act out of character or irrationally at some point to drive the current story to where the creators want it to go.The game still has parts that are decent.  Dialogue is written well enough in certain areas.  Making some conversational choices are still fun depending on how you want Clementine to react to people, even if it doesn't matter.  The game also took an interesting approach allowing you to play as an 11 year old.  Characters typically don't think much of you until you prove to them that you're fully capable of handling yourself.  This was an interesting way for the game to have it make sense that all these people want your help and input into situations.The very best part of the game...........I got to put down ♥♥♥♥♥boy Kenny.  Didn't hesitate for a moment to put a bullet in that piece of garbage.  ♥♥♥♥ you Kenny.WD S2 isn't terrible, but it's hard to get past the constant bad drama, the lack of real character development, and the fact that your choices still have no real meaning.  Also, Kenny is a ♥♥♥♥♥boy, never forget that."

I have read some of the top reviews here and they all start like ""I'm writing this in tears"". :|The First Season was great. It showed us 2 main characters that are trying to survive. They bond, they meet other people and they try to reach their goal. You know about that goal since the beginning. Game had various puzzles which were great because the puzzles felt organic. They weren't some random puzzles placed there because the game is a Point and Click Adventure and they had to put puzzles. They were part of the story. You had to do them in order to survive. Not only that but the whole characters were great. You had to make important decisions in key parts of the game. Besides that the story had great twists. (not going to spoil)Season 2 seems just generally boring. No goal. No purpose. Random characters. People dying left and right. You are forced to do ""important"" decisions so often that everything becomes blend. Things don't even matter anymore. It was pretty funny in the last episode when someone died (yet again) and the characters in game were like ""omg I can't believe he is dead"" ... yea yea... characters were dying since the first 5 minute of the game. Should I still feel something? Besides those problems the game is always trying to shock you... all the time.It seems that TellTale just went the classic sequel format:""Ok. It seems that people really loved the game. We need to make a Season 2. What did people liked? Oh right... important decisions and twists. They really liked the ending. Let's get two other writers and put them do that"".Hell, they even went the old clishee ""I thought you were dead"" ... where you get the best explanation ever ""I guess I was just lucky"".If Clementine was a child in season 1, here she becomes something unreal. It seems that the writers forgot that she is still an 11 years old CHILD. Yea I guess under those circumstances you are forced to mature more quickly, no problems there. I also know that Clementine is the main character for this Season... but again, SHE IS 11.When it comes with interaction... well you have no more puzzles. All you do here is watch the cinematic, ocasionally you are told to press QQQQQQQ then E. Hell, sometimes all you have to do is click something on the screen then the game resumes to be a freaking movie. An uninteresting one I might add. A movie that is 8 hours long where you can't really skip forward and you are forced to watch the end credits every Episode.My recommendation... just play the first one. You woun't be left with the sour taste in your mouth after playing this. Or at least get it when it's 3 euros... but still, you woun't be able to get those 8 hours back. Better read a book or watch a good movie, or hell, play some other games.... and even masturbate. That seems a much better choice.Ah, do you guys remember that 500 Days DLC... where ""things that you do will matter in Season 2"". Nop... it was just a cash grab. There is a guy from the DLC that you literally see for 1 second... just so he will be there.2/5 would not play againP.S. I'm writing this reviews in tears... tears of pain!"

There was more death... lots of death. Typical death. In the end, I was just wishing they would get on with dying, honestly.I didn't find I developed the same relationships with characters in this season as I did in the first. Characters were so sensitive and so busy giving me creepy eyes that it just turned me off from even trying to connect with them before they died. I found that to be probably the most unfortunate part.Aside from that, the game was far more unstable and had many more bugs than the first game did. Everything from graphical issues with eyeballs clipping through lids, characters awkwardly vibrating and teleporting to the game actually freezing and crashing. It felt much less polished than season 1 was and after a number of crashes, I took a break and had a hard time wanting to actually finish it.The mechanics were the same as far as gameplay is concerned except what little puzzles there were seemed much more simple than the first season was and, therefore, gameplay was very quick when it did happen. I don't mind the simplicity to help me immerse myself but it was a bit too much this time around, I think.As far as the story goes, definitely not as good as the first season. It was more of a drag of the same issues over and over. I don't know... I just found I lost interest and was getting somewhat sick of the characters, honestly.I don't think I would recommend this game but there is going to be a season 3 so it may turn out to be a very important bridge between season 1 and 3. I just hope that I don't have to RP a toddler this time. I'd rather go back to playing an adult, honestly. Clem can still stick around, though."

It just isn't much of a ""game"".The Bad:In Season One, you are frequently presented with choices. Some are important, but most are not. A large portion of the game is spent exploring for items or clues. You never have much space, but you are allowed to move around the environments. Zombies are a constant threat.In Season Two, it's much different. The first episode is much like Season One. You can move around, look at things, and make your own decisions. After that, it's a marginally interactive story. Instead of moving your character, you watch your character move. Occassionally you will be allowed to move, but it is always very limited. You will be presented with a narrow path. You won't be able to move in any direction save one.My main complaint is that story has overtaken action. The Walking Dead: Season 2 feels like watching television. I'm not a part of the story. I'm not taking part in the action. I'm not immersed.A lesser concern, is that the game is a bit racist. No, not against minorities, but white people. (You can call it bigotry or reverse-racism if you like.) All the traitors? White. Dumbest characters? White. Craziest characters? White. Evil characters? All white. If the game has a moral message it's, ""Don't trust Whitey!""It's strange that there are so many non-white people in the game. These are survivors right? Given the fact that whites make up 77% of the U.S. population... you would expect to see more of them.The game has similar issues with gender. Most of the men are portrayed as scum. All of the women are given more depth than the men. Men want to conquer and control. Women want to have fun and survive.There is a distinct message sent: white men can only survive by screwing over other people. Personally, I'd prefer it if politics were left of out of video games. I'm playing games for fun, not for socio-political agendas. This is especially annoying when you consider the lack of freedom in the game. I purchased a game about surviving zombies. I'm not interested in a social-justice-disguised-racism story about evil white men oppressing minorities.The Good:Great story. Interesting characters. Beautiful backgrounds.

76561197971652565,Recommended,261030,8117065,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,Striker,"***MAY CONTAIN LIGHT SPOILERS FROM SEASON 1***As a continuation to the superb storytelling found in Season 1, Season 2 appears to be on the path to successfully achieving all that it's predecessor has established. Chapter 1 of this season answers some questions left from the end of Season 1, while once again building up new questions for the current story arc.While I was disappointed in the length of this first chapter, I am hoping that the intent is to give us a clean start to the remainder of the season which will contain much more substance. The cliffhangers of Chapter 1 leave you wanting more, which is an excellent place to be left in an episodic story.Playing as Clementine this time around is a breath of fresh air to say the least. Skill, cunning, and the sheer will to live is what drives Clementine, with everything in life coming much more difficult than if she were an adult or a very strong man such as Lee in Season 1. Rather than stand and fight, Clementine is frequently forced to escape and evade. When cornered she can hold her own, but with the strength of a 10 year old (possibly 11 at this point) she is unable to quickly dispatch most zombies and this leads to a much different experience over the classic zombie slaughter that all other zombie games to date has as the primary focus.So in all, excellent game. I usually like to do a rating using a 1-5 or 1-10 scale, but for this I have to go 1-1000. The rating comes in at a strong 999, with a single point being deducted for the overall length of this first chapter. That point may be redeemed with later chapter releases should the length of Chapter 1 prove to be a strength of the overall game rather than a weakness. My fingers are crossed that I am able to give back the single point on my 1000 point scale.Frankly, I expect nothing less than greatness from this Season. The genre, for most, is quite stale, but no matter how stale the genre is, this game is well worth the full Season Pass cost. If Season 2 ends as amazingly as I suspect it will, I would be willing to easily pay double for Season 3, as this is one game that I truly believe the developers have earned my money with!"

It's essentially a dialog simulator interspersed with some quicktime events and a rare non-challenging puzzle or two.The dialog options don't really seem to make much difference other than so-and-so ""remembering"" something, which so far appears to have little impact on anything.  As far as the story, it sometimes builds up to something that could play out some tension, or perhaps build some interest, but typically it seems the issue is immediately disposed of somehow, and you're right on to being dragged along with the game.  After this happens a few times, any kind of interest in the game just evaporates, and you're pretty much just following along.Of the 4-ish hours I've spent ""playing"" it so far, I'd say I could've walked away from the controller for about 3 of those, with the game happy to go on playing itself without me.  In all honesty, I've put the controller down several times while this game is going, only to grab it to hit one of the seemingly irrelevant dialog options, or frantically mash a button, followed by another random button (is this meant to be enjoyable) in order to move on to the next overly long dialog section.As far as the characters in the game, they're mostly not given much depth, and seem to disappear before they risk developing some.I've enjoyed the first season, and I do intend to see where this one goes, but I won't be rushing to pick up the presumably inevitable third season.Edit - Having finished the season now, I can say for sure that everything I wrote above remains true.By the end, I've played very little of this game in reality.  It seems like TellTale are moving on from adventure games into mildly interactive fiction.  There's no puzzle solving in this game really; in the rare adventure game style moments, everything you need to do is set out right in front of you.If you pretend that this isn't supposed to be a game and some sort of movie or animated comic, the game fails as well.  I really didn't engage with any of the characters, there was no feeling of attachment with any of them (perhaps bar one.)There's a moment in the last episode where someone from the past comes back - this moment is handled well and really highlights to me the shortcomings in this season.  I was reminded of the relationship that had been built between the two characters in the first season - this season just failed to generate anything at all remotely like that.I get that some of you guys love this series or love The Walking Dead as a property which is why I'm getting negged on this review, but this game is really weak.  Season Two is just a massive letdown from Season One."

I’ve never seen so mush time and effect for one litter girl. The last time I shy this was in the lust of us. I advise all players playing it if haven't. Clam was also nice in the game compared to others I’ve seen.Like the fact that Luke’s group left her in the shard, Kenny killing June. After all, that she stalls maintains her good sport, of a heart of a child that you want to protect. She could be as reckless like carver. It is somewhat true that she was hardened for what she shies in season 1. That lee got killed when saving her.

I access its hidden content by downloading tall tell explorer from this lunkhttp://quickandeasysoftware.net/downloads?download=TelltaleExplorer1.1.12.zipFor ensample, at the end of episode 5, after the fact Avro shot clam. That June manses that sarita fared Kenny who will soon become. However, if you don't whish Kenny kill cover.

Even camping above 40 hizz without glancing all the time, or slowing down.Not just that telltale removed the audio clup, that carver admitted he had a wife before the apocalypse.Even anther unused clips that June tale’s Clementine an inappropriate joke. That there removed.There were 2 hidden locansnes in episode 4 amid the ruins, ha-ha-ha telltale; you had 2 different areas in the game that you removed. For what for, at lose keep it so that we can explorer more of the game.Telltale can atlose have their own debug mode that there use to have in Sam & max season 1 even 2.

That might not be as bad ecope for the fact.1. I lose all my items2. Report same cutscine with no passable way to skip. ( one time in no herms way in episode 3 that I have to go back all the way to that spot from all the way to the walking dead episode 1 because I relies being Sarah friends charged the context in the game, now the game does save your aere, the problem was it made other issues for me. Like one has kunnys ending anther has June’s ending tune my forst was clam all alone.Now I dent want to delete all that, so removed it all together quite inconfenite telltale.4.

You should tell Walter. About has friend Mathew, being killed. He walls only do it. If you tell him he is a good guy.If you think about the consegwuses, episode 3 in no harm’s way, nick sues petty march northing.Escape shying; we should not escape to agree with Luke even thaw carver is some crazy note killing people just to make a point how week people are to clam.And not just that we live the camp with or without ham,2.

I loved the first one: It was original, fun to play, interesting, and I actually cared about the outcome of my decisions. There were decent puzzles and places to explore as well as interesting combat/suspense sequences.The second one seems devoid of all that. It's a point-click-to-the-end-of-the-story-line which lasts about an hour and a half per episode (my average). Unlike the first, the decisions you make seem to only change what words are being said to reach the same outcome instead of directly changing some aspect of the story or the people you are with.It's a real shame. Enjoy the first one and don't taint your recollection with a play through of the second one."
,Not Recommended,261030,12839087,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,chairbender,"I got to the point where I just didn't care what happened to anybody. The characters all just argue and argue and behave in ways that people just don't act. The writing seems to lack an understanding of human psychology - the characters frequently behave and speak in ways that just don't square with how humans actually behave. This would be fine in a work where this is expected, but walking dead seems to act like it wants to be some in-depth, introspective lens into human nature (as evidenced by all the conversation where people are talking about how people are acting and trying to understand why they act that way). Well, the way the people act in the game IS strange, but the answer isn't ""humans relationships are complicated"", it's ""the writers want to creat contrived, cliched situations to elicit cheap emotional reactions"". It's not an interesting plot twist to have a character suddenly behave ""unexpectedly"", it just makes the whole experience less beliavable. This unbeliavable behavior carries over into the dialogue, which I found to be frequently stilted.Furthermore, now having a better understanding of the ""Telltale Engine"", I was able to recognize when given dialogue choices would have an effect on the story. This makes for an overall unsatisfying experience - you want the character to act a certain way in a given situation, but when you see the dialogue choices it's like they are just teasing you with how little agency you have. It's no longer an invitation to ""play along"" with the story, it's now just a reminder of your frustrating lack of influence on the game. I'm fine with having less influence on the story, but I don't see the point of letting me say three different things or be silent if I consciously understand that it won't have an impact on anything - it's just immersion breaking.If you've played lots of Telltale games now, you'll start to see a lot of recurring patterns in their games (especially a lot of repeptition within the walking dead series). The very recognition of those story patterns hurts the immersion. Characters argue, then some action happens, then something bad happens to somebody. Some characters voice their mistrust for others, only to betray them later. There's a tense situation, and then something goes wrong. Characters argue for stupid, unbelievable reasons and all you can say is ""PLEASE STOP ARGUING"", ad infinitum. It's hard to explain how I experienced the story, but I just tended to groan as I guessed what was going to happen and ended up being right. The times where I guessed wrong were great, but few and far between.All of this aside, it's a gameplay experience that hardly any other game provides and it's certainly entertaining in some ways. If you don't get all hung up on the believability of the characters and let yourself get immersed in the story (and suspend your disbelief), you're in for a great experience. I'm just not personally able to do that for this game, and I think there were ways this game could've been changed to make that process a bit easier."

Yes More talk and less actual game or choices.Choices don't matter or even affect things. Choices that by all logic should have saved a character's life do nothing.Unlikable characters who's purpose is to sure the Death of one of the few likable characters via sheer stupidity.Tricked into thinking a Baby was Murdered just so it can repeat a Kenny vs other guy power struggle.Kenny fought with Sarah in Season one. However fighting with some other character is the majority of what Kenny does in season 2. It's like the creators only remembered that Kenny Fought with Sarah and just rolled with it the entire second season.As a whole Season 2 feels lazy. Less Dramatic. You never get to see the Dramma and Emotion that made season 1 great. The majority of characters are so rushed and have so little dialog you never get to know most of them enough to care. And the few new characters you do end up liking get killed off by the unlikable characters. Not to be mistaken for the Villian.Season one all but a few characters died off because that's how the story worked. However Season 2 Seems it felt repeating that level of death was so nessicary that half the deaths seem and feel either preventable, stupid, and even unrealistic. This is further worsened by the Linar options to attempt to save the lives of characters that all have the excact same death result regardless of choice or action taken.The whole make you think a baby was Murdered bit was also a poor design choice, it results in either 1 or 2 preventable deaths. Hell even the most desentized people find the though of a horrible violent death of a infant sickening. Hell a Large majority of people not bothered by dark stuff are bothered by that should have been a warning it was a bad idea.Season 2 isn't bad in that you feel ripped off or regret the purchase but it is a one and done kind of game. In short it's one of those levels of bad that you don't feel it deserves to be called bad but you will not be expecting a Season 3 for obvious reasons. No there isn't that much closure in Season 2.

Typing that actually makes me feel a little ill, since I was blown away by season one and The Wolf Among Us, and had nothing but high hopes for this. I wish, I really, really do, that I could let this go with ""well maybe I expected too much, but overall at least it was a decent game that I enjoyed."" But I can't. It's bad. It's a bad game and a worse sequel and if you enjoyed it then more power too you, I wish I could be sitting in your shoes right now.Oh by the by, this season has a bigger focus of QTEs. I know a lot of people don't like them, so. A lot of stuff in this review is admittedly subjective, but that at least I'm fairly sure is not. Personally, it didn't bother me all that much.The plot is Okay. It's not very well paced but it could have been much worse and it definitely could have carried a decent narrative if, like season one, it was backed by solid writing and good character development. Unfortunately it ain't, and when your entire success thus far has hinged upon good writing and character development, that's a death sentence. So many characters have zero development, little personality to start off with, and simply potter around the plot until they are unceremoniously killed off once the writers forget what they were ever there for. Remember in season one where deaths packed a punch and were meaningful, even if the only meaning was that life was cheap and fragile in this post-apocalyptic world? None of that. People die, nobody cares (including, tragically often, the player) and any hint of grief sub-plots for the survivors are relegated to one-sentence ""dang, I sure am torn up about that yup"" bits or cut off by that character's own anticlimactic death. *spoilers for the 2nd episode on after this*The only character who really gets a significant amount of focus is Kenny, who bumbles through a pale imitation of the character development he already underwent in season one but hey, recycling that definitely wouldn't cheapen the entire previous game at all. If you like Kenny, great. I liked Kenny. I thought Kenny's character arc in season one was among the highlights of that season. The writers evidently don't, because cheapening a character's sacrifice with a hackneyed ~but you never saw the body~ ploy and deleting all his growth and charm is just about the worst thing I could imagine doing to a character. If you don't like Kenny, and you never liked Kenny, then you have my sincere condolences.I could go on in more detail, but frankly even if it were just those points it'd be enough for me to give a negative review. They're just such entry-level blunders that I honestly thought this series was above, and they dominate the entire experience. I hope it gets better if there's a season three, if only because clicking the ""No"" button on a review of a TellTale game has made my soul break out in a nasty rash."

There were a few profound moments, but all in all, it felt a bit disjointed. The whole time you feel a little aimless, as though there is nothing you're working towards. Without a goal, there is little motivation. This is most evident in the final chapter where the storyline dissolves into ""this happens, then this happens, then this is the end"". It doesn't even feel like an apt ending for the journey you have just embarked upon, and left me feeling literally nothing.The speech choices you make are also nowhere near as good as the first game. I would say most of the time all you're trying to do is placate two parties in arguments by saying pointless things like ""NO! STOP!"" which have no affect on the stroy. Also the constant arguing in the game made it a little dull, it needed to be mixed up a lot more with happier moments, that remind you why you're trying to survive this hell at all.During the first game, playing as Lee, you felt real purpose with Clem being your dependent. You protected her and raised her, giving you a much greater emotive motivation. Playing just as Clem, and having very few characters in your group you even care about or are that likeable, just sapped a lot of the motivation. The arrival of the baby AJ assuaged this feeling somewhat, but it was too little, too late.The amount of play time was also very disappointing, the entire 5 chapters taking me only 9.6 hours (less than 2 hours per chapter), again giving a sense that the story was a little rushed. The action sequences were also boring when put in comparison to the first game.The Walking Dead was one of my favourite games of all time, so it's not that surprising the sequel hasn't lived up to its incredible predecessor, but for me it's not just fallen a little short, but very short. Almost as if it had been made by different developers. Let's hope they will spend a little more time creating a truly compelling, beautiful, goal driven story should they create a Season 3. But I wont hold my breath."

They killed off the villain too soon and took away any actual choice in the later chapters.You'd think they were making some sort of point of giving you no power as you're playing as a little girl but 9 times out of 10 they treat the PC as an adult whenever a huge decision needs to be made or they need someone to blame for not ""doing enough"". It was also sad to see how the dlc from the first game was barely implemented in the game.In conclusion: much of the writing was manipulative, gameplay unengaging and the game had an unsatisfying ending. Only recommended for die-hard fans of The Walking Dead and Clementine."
76561198202404816,Not Recommended,261030,13904019,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,SaneMan,"So if you liked Season 1 - and I really did like it - but were frustrated by its often too simplistic gameplay, the occasional moment of incredulity, and the nagging feeling that you were mostly being offered the illusion of choice, then I suspect you will be disappointed by Season 2.For me, the first season was enjoyable because it provided the rarest of experiences in a game: an emotionally engaging story with likeable and interesting characters. Tolstoy it ain't, but relative to its peers it offered something more by presenting a narrative full of compelling characters who you could genuinely love or hate (or both, in Kenny's case) and by creating moral dilemmas which forced you to make painful decisions. It wasn't a simplistic moral universe of good and bad, black and white, but a more tangibly real moral universe of corrupt and imperfect beings trying to survive and strugglng to hold on to their humanity. Now, because of all these wonderful things, I was able to put aside the recurring feeling that I had been reduced to the gaming equivalent of a lobotomized chimpanzee with a mouse. Because I was sufficiently immersed in the story, I was able to put aside the irksome sense that I was mostly just watching the game play itself. And, in fact, the lazy fat man in me loved the fact that I could drink a beer and eat a four course meal between those occasional moments of physical contact with either mousepad or keyboard.So ""playing"" Season 2 is like waking up from the nightmare that Lee has in the back of Kenny's RV in Episode 3 of Season 1. Remember that? Remember feeling stupid when, whilst frantically bashing the Q button to prevent zombie Clem from eating you, all of a sudden you wake up and realise that all your button bashing was a tricksy little ruse? Aye.  But that was a genuinely fun and clever moment. Not so in Season 2.  Turns out, you're not really playing the game, you're not really making any choices (except for one richly ironic exception), and you're probably not giving a ****  because the characters are weak and the story is limper than a squid in a hot tub.To give a few meaty examples (vis-a-vis example 4: pun intended)...1. The Illusion of ChoiceI fell asleep somewhere in episode 3. I woke up, not knowing how much I'd missed, and played out the rest of the episode before going back to the beginning and playing it out again to see what I'd missed and how it would affect the outcome. Conclusion: being asleep and doing nothing resulted in the same outcome as actually playing the game. Sweet. That's true for most of the game, except for those really challenging bits where you have to click the mouse or push a directional button to prevent yet another grisly zombie mastication death.2. The Irony of ChoiceSo the one choice that does make a significant difference - this one being deliciously ironic - is your FINAL CHOICE. That's right, in the dying seconds of the game, the choice you make actually dramatically influences the final outcome. Except, HA HA HA, it doesn't actually matter because the credits are going to roll right atfer you make that choice. Ah, I see, making a choice means savouring the consequences within my imagination rather than in the game itself. Thanks Telltale, my face is still red from that slap. Perhaps in Season 3 you can just offer us a one minute episode, give us a big juicy decision to make, and our imaginations will take it from there!3. Lowest Common Denominator StorytellingGoes like this: characters show up, characters swear a lot, characters ask Clem to do some donkey work and make important life decisions for them, characters die. Add zombies and repeat.4. OH MY GOD, THE INCREDULITY!(CONTAINS SPOILERS) In episode 1, Clem is once again alone and vulnerable. She's in the woods and she has no food. She's attacked by a hungry dog and she has the choice to kill it once it has been fatally injured. Yes, it used to be someone's pet, and yes, before it turned into a crazed, half-starved bloodthirsty hound it was really cute, but this is the zombie apocalypse: the walking dead are everywhere, and whatever survivors are left have witnessed hell on earth. There's♥♥♥♥♥♥ murder, pillage, madness, even cannibalism. So, of course, Clem is going to have to make a pretty easy ""moral"" decision here. The old hypocrisy (""you can't eat dogs!"")  of the pre-apocalypse meat eaters doesn't seem to have much relevance in a world where the undead habitually feast upon the entrails of the living, and friends and families habitually brain each other to prevent their loved ones from ""turning"". So, we the gamers, still stuck in the hypocrisies of the old world, must once again yield, must make what seemed to me a very clever but infinitesimal moral concession. Indeed, clever because infinitesimal. How astute of Telltale to make us feel guilt over a dead dog in a way we might not, after all we've witnessed thus far, for a fallen human. Once again, we find ourselves condoning things we otherwise might not as the young Clementine feasts upon some oh-so-tasty dog meat to survive. And eat it she must, because she has no idea if or when another meal will come. But wait a second, what!? She's what!? She's just walking away!? WT*!? I THOUGHT SHE WAS SMART! I THOUGHT SHE WAS A SURVIVOR! Really? REALLY!? As Clementine, we have to watch - and often participate in - the most brutal acts of violence imaginable: people hacking and slashing each other to pieces with axes and knives, smashing skulls in with hammers and crowbars, shooting each other in the face at point blank range, we see zombies eating the entrails of their victims, or having screwdrivers shoved through their eye sockets, or their jaws ripped out with hunting knives. But eating a dead dog to survive? Nope, doesn't occur to us.  Despite all the horror and the madness, our cushy-mushy, puppy-wuppy, petsy-wetsy moralities remain steadfastly and infuriatingly intact.  Woof."

When i had to ""deal with Duck"" I welled up... when Lee & Clem said good bye, I was floored..... in short I was blown away by the experience.S2 has failed to live up to that in Ch1 & 2.So far having played two Chapters of S2 i've found the point&click thing is barely more than used to move the story at your pace. There are no puzzels to solve and no moments where it feels like anything matters. That's partly becauses the characters are flat and you end up not really caring about them.

It's here!Unfortunately it's not very good, the gameplay is focused around the plot instead of the other way around, there's no real puzzle elements or hub areas in which you can talk to characters to get a better feel for them instead the game is consistently scripted at a brisk pace to keep you ""entertained"" with the story element over everything else. The game is full of QTEs and there's very little in the aspect of ""point and click"" beside what dialogue choices you're given that won't matter much because the actual choices you go with really do not alter the story in any real way, shape or form.The choices you're given don't really branch off into anything that truly mixes up or re-directs the narrative of the game, I find the choices just throw out an alternate of two potential scenes then goes right back into the main flow of the actual plot without any change beside a character dying or a character commenting on something you've done. You're never really given a breather with the game either, it's a constant push for the next thing to happen in the story rather than to settle in a calm before the storm and it's a rather inane way of creating immersion for the player.Ultimately I find myself enjoying it to an extent but it's not the same as the previous season and the quality shows. Aside from the original key writer and director of the first season leaving Telltale to form their own company and Telltale biting off more than they can chew when it comes to franchises to convert into video game form the quality has dropped and with the wait of three months inbetween each episode I think it's fair to say that the ball has been dropped and Telltale have really messed up.I'd give this season so far a weak 6/10.I'm not invested in the emotional aspect of the game, it's just an illusion to hide behind the lack of quality this season brings to cater to a very dumb audience of emotionally starved gamers."

The new UI they use tries to hard to look good instead of keep the functionallity the original had. Their settings don't even work properly, the game won't accept 120hz input like its predecessor.The new action scenes aren't as exciting and are already tedious when compared to how they were before, the new arrow commands are flawed and often unresponsive.The game itself has become more linear, originally you could sit back and take your time, talk to other characters and enjoy backstory, which also influenced decisions. Now you're just along for the ride, your decisions are so far virtually limited only to what's immediately happening. No more getting to wander around and talk to the characters and listen to what they have to say, the only notable time when you could ""kind of"" do that was at the bridge, and even then there was no chance to conversate with your group in its entirety.As a game in general 7/10Compared to the original 3/10Would I buy it again?

The story is meh, characters are generic, the voice actors are bad, and the animations are awful.

Moments that should be meaningful and ahve a build up have none and the story jsut continues to go without really addressing the problem.

If you enjoy low quality then you will love this without a doubt! However, if you find yourself as a person with standards, an extensive reading history, and enjoy the finer things I would stay away. Because this game is not meant for you! It is mostly directed at people who don't quiet understand writing, storylines, or character archetypes. If I had to recommend this to a certain age group I would say 8-10 that way they would grow up with a sense of what low quality truly is and may actually better the industry. I would definitely suggest staying away if you pay attention to detail... as this game has no detail whatsoever and graphics wise is cringeworthy even with the style taken in to consideration.There is even a sign in episode one that states ""poisonous snakes"" which are non existent."

The episodes were supposed to be 2 weeks appart, so I can under stand being a week or two behind because two weeks is a bit of a short window. Even though the game should largely have been completed when the first episode was released. I liked that they brought somebody from season one back, but almost every descision you make in episode 2 resolves in episode 2 and all the major descisions are absolutly rendered pointless. Something will happen usually somebody dies, that makes any desicion you make seem pointless. I might as well just sit and watch a movie.I will admit that I am not a huge Walking Dead fan. The TV show is just a night time soup opera with a zombie here and there, but I loved the first season of this game. I really cared about the characters and I felt that my desicions had at least some wait. Season two started off promissing but then, with episode two, it just fell appart. I can't get attached to characters, because I have no real impact. If I save a character or anger a character or anything else they are usually dead a minute later, or I have some action that, if I try to play my character they way I would think they would act, reverses everything I just worked for.Season one was a master piece, but I would wait until more episodes are released for this game before making buying it. Maybe it will get better, but unless they can stick to their set schedules and actually allow you to make some meaningfull descisions, then I don't see that happening. Until then I recomend A Wolf Among Us as a better alternative and likely were all of tell tell's attention is deverted to.Update: Ok so episode 3 is now out. Things are looking better, but with yet anouther long wait and an even shorter installment I still cannot recommend this game. Though the story does seem to be improving."

,Not Recommended,261030,8693822,"Posted: 13 January, 2014",all,Ashes,"Now that the season is finally over, I can review the game as a whole. And unfortunately, I was mostly left dissapointed by it.We still have the great artwork, voice acting and soundtrack. So that is the good parts. Now let's move onto the bad.The most glaring issue this game has, compared to Season 1, is the lack of character development. The first 4 episodes of character development consists of people dumping their personal issues onto Clem. They never ask anything or talk to her about anything but their problems. Season 1 had a lot of character development and even the minor characters you got to know better. Not just ""I have issue this."". The problems never defined them. It's as if Larry was just his heart condition and nothing more. That he would never talk about anything but that. But of course he doesn't, he develops a lot more and talks about things besides that. It made him a person you could like or dislike.In this season, I just found myself annoyed and didn't care for the characters. One character desperately tries to replace Lee, but I never felt a connection with him. Anytime he asked me for help or asked me to talk with him, I'd just ignore him. One time he even asks me to cover him so he can get out of danger and I only did so, so that I could mess it up and get him hurt. I don't care this little for characters, I usually get very attached to them. Such as in Season 1, Lee was always warming my heart and was so inspiring to listen to. To give in example of Season 2, there's guy A who walks up to Clem. All I expected was that he was going to talk or ask something about his issue. And what does he do? ""Hey Clem, I need this for my issue. Can you give me it?"". Prior to that, he had never stopped to talk to Clem at all. Why would I care about him? He never really sits down to talk with her so they get to know one another.The other problem with the new characters is that they are all so ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. I lost count on all the amount of facepalms and sighs I did throughout the season, whenever someone did something obviously idiotic. On a watch to make sure the Walkers don't eat the children? That's a great time to have a ""quickie"" with someone.... I mean seriousy, I am not kidding. The only person on watch ignores his duty to make whoopie.And it really doesn't end there. The adults (including the parent!) leaves a mentally disabled child WITH A LOADED GUN and leaves the door unlocked so that the obvious creepy bad guy can just waltz in. And who do they blame for the door being unlocked? Clem of course! Ugh.How did these people survive more than five minutes together?Even though you are given the option to ""affect"" the story, the first 3 episodes lack these choices greatly. I think the biggest impact you had on the story was to choose the decoration for a house. I mean, wow... that's what we expect in a game about life and death, yeah? It was the only time my choice felt important. 4 had some better options, but ultimately become redundant, as no matter what you chose, it just ends up the opposite anyway.Not only that, but the first 3 episodes drag out on the story. You think that within that time, they should be able to fill it with enough to entertain me. But it's just the same thing, over and over. People dumping issues on Clem, no real character development and people doing the most glaringly dumb things. The episodes relies too heavily on the ""shock value"" that Telltale is famous for. It just falls flat because when you don't care for anyone, there isn't anything to be shocked about. In episode 4, I was mostly angry rather than sad at the outcome. There is obvious time and means to do things right, yet nobody really tries, just for the shock value. At least episode 4 ends somewhat interesting.And then episode 5 arrives and most shockingly... there's so much character development! People are talking to each other about their past, about their thoughts and feelings... and it feels like you're right back at Season 1. This is what I have been waiting for in 4 episodes and I am actually starting to enjoy Season 2 for once. There's interesting turn of events, choices in the story that matters hugely on the plot development. And I actually started caring enough for characters that I resisted some choices in the conversations. Now that means I have gotten attatched to some and it's a good thing.So, well... I sincerely hope that Season 3 stays true to episode 5s turn of event and keeps up the characters development."

Quite a few ""wander around"" moments making you do the usual menial tasks (grab a piece of wood, light the fire, etc). Most of it feels like ""shouting as mommy and daddy are fighting."".If you still want to try it out though i recommend looking up the storyline on youtube so you can be sure of what you're getting in to.

Also, it features diversity without banging it over your head or making political statements.A great exercize in human nature, this game (and the first) will make you question things you believe, and who you would be in a WROL situation. Ethics and morality are strained against survival. This series is essentially a long socratic exercize. Suppose that tomorrow you were thrown into a situation where acting selflessly could cost you. Cost you your next meal, your next drink, your personal safety, or your life. Would you do it?I think some of you answers will surprise you.

A lot of the time you can get an idea of where the story is going with the dialogue choices you are prsented with but it's not always what it seems. Both seasons are very well written and I'm not usually a fan of cell shaded...well anything, but the artwork is also well done. There are some facial expressions that are a little comical though.

Without any spoilers, I will say that this game has a new feel and look to it that the first game did not. The creators took the time to refine some of the weaker points of the first game: building suspense, taking a slower pace to build up to that similar of the show. The game leaves you wanting more, just like what happens when the cliffhanger happens in the TV show.The only thing I will say that is negative is that the start is a bit slower, it isn't what you're used to just having finished the first game.

Ep 1 holds nothing back, with some very intense sequences, both gameplay and story wise. Part of what made season 1 so great was Clem, and although now you control her as the main protagonist, she still has the same charm that made her such a great character in season 1. I do agree that in regards to the overall story and the general sense of where it's all going, it did come off as vague, but I don't see why that should be seen as a negative. It's an episodic game, and a part of what made season 1 so great was not seeing what was coming up.

The zones appear well made and the story detail is rich. Clementine appears just as resilient as she was previously.Cons: Although the game continues in the same story driven format as before, I have yet to feel the same connection with these characters. Keep in mind this is only episode one and I anticipate the connection to grow as the story developes. Additionally I encountered a few graphical/interface bugs. On three occasions my mouse cursor would disappear and I was unable to select a conversational response. On two occasions charcters would appear in areas it was apparent they were not supposed to be and were non interactable.

She goes through many tragedies, many deaths, and many close calls throughout this episode, some harder to watch than others. Although this episode is pretty short, probably due to Telltale's new, busier schedule, it is definitely as good, if not better, than episode 1 of season 1. We've got a little to wait before we can tell whether or not it would be an instant classic like the first game, but so far, I'm excited.+Amazing storytelling+Clementine is an incredible lead character, perhaps better than she was as a support in the last game+Definitely tense-Shorter than the other episodes-May be hard to play for parents, especially ones with daughters"

It may have zombies, but that's just a distraction to the real threat... Human beings.An homage to point/click adventure games minus the complex puzzles at times to maintain a flow of the story. While I will say that for a game that touts it being as every choice matters (and it does to a point) I find myself often choosing the lesser or greater of the same outcome for some characters with really no choice on how their life plays out in the grand scheme of the main story. This doesn't happen often, but when you're left with a choice of Person A getting killed by way of X or getting killed by way of Y it leaves you with a somewhat defeated feeling.The graphical style is very similar to the comic book, which helps distinguish it from the TV show while still remaining relevant to the universe in which it exists. The animations are done very well and really help you connect with the characters emotions.The music is both haunting and moviing. There are some repeated songs, but they are still great and help to convey the emotion to be delivered in each scene.Voice acting is also done well, and all fits into getting you to connect with each scene.Overall, these games are a worty buy for a casual gamer who enjoys to sit back and watch a story unfold that has snap decisions that must be made often that affect the outcome of the story direction with key characters.An excellent game for $25 and a worthy price point that beats out $60 AAA titles. This is a story of a journey by a person in a world where the threats are beyond a simple life and that real friends that you trust are hard to come by.9/10"

Gone are the days of lanky college kids who royally ♥♥♥♥ up even the smallest things, but in the end, strive for redemption in the eyes of the man he has wronged the most, only to gain the forgiveness of him when he least expects it.Gone are the fantastic voice jobs by Dave Fennoy in the role of ""Lee Everett"", who makes a much better Pro-tah-gonist than Clementine does.Speaking of Clementine, this game gets some flak for allowing you to go against her sweet and caring nature in the first game, and play her more as if Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer have claimed joint ownership of her body, which isn't exactly a bad thing. So what if you can threaten a pregnant woman, and tell a little girl to suck it up after her dad belts her acrossed the face? This is a post apocalyptic word, people. Even the kindest people are going to get hardened by seeing their closest friends and family taken from them in the blink of an eye.While Season 2 isn't anywhere near the excellent narrative piece of the first season, it's still quite the experience. You even get to meet an old friend, who I was especially excited to see, even if his reason for being there is an excellent example of the writers just hand waving his mere existence at this point and time as mere fan service.Also of note is, that as of this review, The Year of our Lord 2014, June 26th, there are still about two episodes left to be released, so when you complete the game, you can wait for the next episodes in real time!

Its not a ""game"" in a classical sense though, which is not to be seen as negative, but supporting the general concept of this ""game"".The Story is great, it has several surprising plottwists and it makes you love and hate the characters you will meet and interact with. This delivers everything you want from this series.The Graphics are not really state of the art, even if you look at the graphicstyle they use, its not great, it has many blurry textures. But generally the art-stile is fantastic and it supports the game itself in all of its ""darkness"" and world of no clear borders.Get this game and see for yourself.

Like 1, it will entertain with depressing, shocking, and tense moments. The Walking Dead games by Telltale make you feel like you're an actual character in a story. For me, most games don't have that feel and I definitely wish more ""choose your own adventure"" style games like this would come out. It makes for a good change of pace from other game genres. It's especially good if you like the idea of making moral decisions and trying to form the world around your character based on options you pick and choose.With that said, there are some drawbacks, of course. I only have .4 hrs on record after completing the episode and I admittedly won't replay it much. Mainly because, like season 1, all roads kind of lead to Rome - your choices alter the dialogue and overall feel of your character in relation to the story, but the plot outcomes are set in place and are unlikely to change dramatically. If that doesn't bother you, and it certainly doesn't bother me, then have fun playing this episode - but I recommend buying season 1 first!"

Also, I wish you got to know the new characters a little bit more as I didn't really get the chance to form a proper judgment most of them.

The story has quite a few punches at its disposal.There are several likeable characters and most of the dialog options feel natural.What I didn't like:- Overal Story -There is no real overarching goal in this Season. Sure, it's about moving to Wellington.All characters just seem to agree that is's better there, but the reasons are vague, seldom discussed and - most of all - are based on gossip.Therefore, the overall story feels like 'people stumbling through the woods with♥♥♥♥♥♥happening at every step"".Maybe the game should have stuck with a few locations for longer than one episode. I think there where a few places which would have been interesting for more exploration.Finally, what brought me on edge: Convenient-Plot-Device-Zombies.It baffles me everytime how simple these slow walking, moaning creatures can sneak up on a group of people without anyone noticing before it's to late. Even in the open!There where a few scenes where no zombie was anywhere to be seen and then SNAP! Zombies everywhere!... c'mon...- Engine -I know I know, this game has an indie price tag. Anyhow, the engine flaws destroy the immersion often.For me, the biggest problems are with the animations: Sloppy transitions and laggy character movements.The bottom line is, that this game has its flaws. But not enought to not recommend it.If you buy this game during a summer sale, you're not doing anything wrong."

However, in some aspects it can be even more grim than the original version. I am still under its influence - badly.One minor gripe: on OS X, the Xbox controller support did not work as in previous games; however, I did not want to learn a new control scheme for this game (after season 1), so I had to play it in Windows.

Unlike the first game (Which is a incredable game and I love it) your choices mean a little more in this one. The walking dead had one ending but still made you feel like your choices got you there, in season 2 there are 7 diffrent endings. Who you choose to trust or help first really makes a diffrents.While playing I saw people that trusted me completly slowly lose that trust basied on my actions. Trying to hold the group together when S**t hits the fan was a struggle, yet rewarding when you see the group agree or get along for a few precious moments. And the death of charaters leave more of an impact on you and the other suriviors than in the other game.My only complant is that sometimes the voice acting is a little off. Like when Mike talks about eating a raccoon, it felt a little phoned in. But most of the time the voice acting is amazing and I found myself forgetting that these charaters aren't real.This game is amazing, I love how clem has grown and learned from Lee, I love how the charaters act irrational in an irrational world and begin to lose themselves in the madness.

If you are considering buying it, make sure you get the first season before you get the second, as playing the first season lets you continue with the choices you made in the first. To start, it is completely driven by you. You can decide what you want your character to say, who dies, etc. It is a story-based game, so if you don't care for story, this isn't your cup of tea. Just like the first season, this one has 5 episodes. Throughout the game, it has you nervous and wondering what's going to happen or who's going to die next. There are multiple endings to the game.

,Recommended,261030,9385924,"Posted: 8 March, 2014",all,Arkaid,"Reviewing up to Episode 2:So far, a great sequel to the first season. Now you play as Clementine, which I think makes the choices easier. Lee was in a moral gray area ( a convict who commited murder in an act of passion) and some choices in the game where really hard to make ( seemingly, there was no right and wrong ). Now, however, ss an 11 year old girl, the choices the games give you aren't as morally ambiguous and usually a lot easier to select ( this is specially true in ep. 1 and you can see that pretty much everyone made the same choices by the end of the episode. )Episode two gives a few more 50-50 choices. This time is not hard to choose because they're morally gray, but because the outcome of the choices does not seem to matter. I think this is because you're no longer the leader of the group and basically Clem is out to save herself, rather than trying to keep the group together and alive.All in all, though, the story is great, engaging and fun to play. Totally recommend it if you liked the first one."

In the first season, you play with a different gameplay than most games where it focuses primarily on the story instead of battle as you go through some quicktime events and a few moments of self defense; as well as a not often used style of art where it seems both drawn and 3D. Coming over from season one, you play as Clemintine who is now a girl and yet she is not. The circumstances of her parents and Lee, coupled with her desperate need to survive have clearly shaped her into a woman an a child's body. As the game goes on and your group begins to fall apart, your decisions once again feed into any situation and both your choices in actions and responses may or may not save members of your group. With many of these decisions, Clemintine seems even more adult-like compared to the arguing grown-ups that surround her. But of course, tragedy and surprises are quite normal in this game as some new faces disappear, and even a familiar face returns. I give this season five stars and reccomend it to everyone, though not of all ages."

Although it was pretty short in terms of actual story progression. The group goes from the location of the shootout to the captured prisoners camp. Many choices up until the end mean almost nothing just provideing a different speech outcome or a different way of death for most characters. With your first initial playthrough the story seems to not have been that good. but upon replay of the ending there are serveral different ways to end the game ( at least 4 i know of). This will provide a much greater experiance for the next season considering the wide variety of ways to end the game.

One of the biggest successes, in my opinion, was to continue the incredibly mature story while allowing the player to act as the 11-years old Clementine. Nothing seems fake and everyting remains perfectly established throughout the adventure. I'm starting to think that Telltale may be the only video game company that knows how to properly tell a story without falling into the clichés of the genre. After the stunning The Wolf Among Us, Telltale Games keeps on surprising us. Let's see what these artists will manage to do with Tales of The Borderlands and the adaptation of Game of Thrones."

The Story revolves around a little girl named Clementine and every choice she makes, can be deadly. It can be very depressing, it can make you angry at some points thoughout the game. This game doesn't need reviews because it is loved. I recommend playing season 1 first though. You can make Clementine a epic 11-year old by saying still like ""Still.Not.Bitten."" Or you can make her relie on others and quite shy if you want, you can do this because of the choices you can make her say.

I didn't see how the strange bond that forms between player and Clementine in the first season could be recreated, especially given the fact that you play as Clementine in this season. But as I played through the first three episodes (at the time of this review, that's all that's been released), I found myself as immersed in the game as I was in the first. The characters are very well-developed and numerous throwbacks to the first season keep emotions high. The intensity of the game equals that of the first, and may even surpass it at times. I can safely say that if you have played and enjoyed the first season, purchasing the second installment will definitely be worth your time and money."

If you're looking for an emotional rollercoaster where every turn brings difficult choices and surprise encounters, then I definitely recommend this series.Season 2 starts off a little slower than its prequel, though at the time of my review there's still two episodes yet to be released. It also seems like the episodes are shorter, even if you spend a considerable amount of time interacting with every item and person you come across. However, it still takes around an hour to finish each episode on your first playthrough.The combat is not challenging, as it does employ the same point-and-click system as the first season, though there seems to be a little bit more time to react to an attack than there had been before. It manages to be enjoyable for both casual and experienced gamers, especially if you don't go into it expecting a Left 4 Dead-style zombie-slaying game.Overall, I'd definitely recommend giving this game a try, but I strongly urge you to play through the first season if you haven't already.

It's also hard to express how disappointed I am with this game, but that I will do.I will start with what annoyed me more than anything, what was done with the characters from 400 Days.  4 out of the 5 main characters appear only to deliver one line in the background and the other one was a minor character with a small storyline that was shoe horned into Season 2.  It's impossible to feel that 400 Days was nothing but a cash grab by Telltale.Speaking of characters, there weren't that many in this game.  It's hard to label anyone a character save for the midboss of the game.  The rest are just levers to move the game along to the conclusion the game wants to come to, which I will get to in a second.  In the first game you had so many characters in the desolate landscape to come across.  The cancer victims, the St. Johns, the man on the radio, the woman at the hotel, carly, etc. etc. etc.  This game had none of that.The gameplay was also weak by comparison to the first game.  The sequence when you first get to the hotel in Season 1 has no comparison in this game.  It has a few stealth sections.  But they can mostly be gone through just by moving at normal speed without any planning.The climax of the game seems like the developers wrote what they wanted to happen on a dry erase board but didn't have a really good idea on how to achieve it.  So we end up with two characters acting completely irrationally and doing insane things to achieve what should be a cool visual that has been brutally nerfed by how they acheived it.  And they can't even do that right by having one of the outcomesOddly, the thing I liked most about the game was the ending, seperate from the final confrontation, which was ridiculous.  All three of the possible endings had a bittersweet quality about them, calling back to the ending of season 1, but without it's power and the strength of season 1 behind it.I wouldn't recommend this game, unless you are a big fan of the walking dead or adventure games.  Or you are hoping that Telltale pulls it together for a good season 3.  Play wolf among us instead, it was really good, and had a good story throughout."

When i heard about it at first i thought that it won't work (because Clemintine was who you played as) but surprisingly it was great. Clemtine goes through hell (even more than Carl in my opinion). The charcters are very intresting with great voice acting. Omid and Christa returns (for a little while). The gameplay is way better than the first season, going for a more wolf among us interface. The dialogue is superb. I only a had a 1 or 2 negatives. Which is that the ending was too abrupt and made me want more. Also I thought there was a problem with importing my choices from season 1. But besides that it was a great first episode, not as good as the wolf among us, but still great.The Good- Great Charcters- Amazing Voice Acting- Better Gameplay- Clemintine goes through hellThe Bad-Ending was too abrupt-Importing my choices didn't work too wellThe Score8.5Episode 2 reveiw (SPOILERS)Ok so episode 1 was great and there were fantastic momments in it but this episode is far suprioior. So essetioally clementine is with whoever you saved last season (For me it was Pete). There was quite an intense mommnent at the start of the game. Pete gets bitten and you have to help him before he dies. After that the episode got better and better. The dialogue was great this time as well.

However, following Clementine again, but this time from her point of view and not from her guardian Lee's, you find her more grown up and more capable than you remember her.The story is exciting, with several twists and turns as you head towards the inevitable cliffhanger.  There are hints of the choices you made in the first game (as these are imported when you begin, assuming you have them on your PC).There are several new characters, whose motives aren't entirely clear from the off.  Sometimes I found they annoyed me - their actions didn't seem particularly reasonable or realistic, but then we are in the middle of an apocalypse so I guess people wouldn't all behave rationally!  Clementine must make some difficult moral choices to secure her own survival.I'm looking forward to the next installments - I just hope TT don't take months to release them again.  I noticed they don't make any promises for releasing the chapters ""monthly"" like they promised, but didn't deliver, last time.  That's a good thing.

It is quite different from the first, as the player character changed, and thus, the point of view. It is refreshing, and at the same time awing. Unlike the first season, I found myself hesitating A LOT in dialogues, meaning I used often the ""..."" non-answer because I just couldn't choose (because it was hard, and consequences could be dramatic, not because the proposed choices were invalid).One thing I WANT is a patch for the two games enabling the player to view his saved game from begining to the end, and thus, relive all those moments (I mean, the dialogues, and the cutscenes).

Again, it's a movie-like expericence where the feels are real, the story flows beautifully, and I feel every joy and cringe at every loss. The characters are even more realistic and the situations even more delicate, making every choice potetially life-changing.There's only one complaint I have, and sadly it is again to do with the control interface. Trying to chose how to interact with an object (look, pick up, etc.) is even harder than in the first season, and the new click-and-drag mechanic is a pain in the @$$ and doesn't work half the time, even when I'm running my mouse across the entire mousepad. The click-and-drag is also so poorly explained even with the help option turned on that I had to look up a tutorial after monkeying around for a good 10 minutes just trying to figure out *SPOILER ALERT* how to stitch Clementine's arm *END SPOILIER*. Thankfully, you don't have to do too much dragging around.Overall, I'd highly recommend getting this game. Some minorly gimmicky controls aside, this adventure is a piece of art, and I honestly cannot wait for Chapters 4 and 5 to come out. Just don't forget your Kleenex, you'll be needing them again for this roller-coaster ride.**CHAPTERS 4 AND 5 UPDATE/EDIT**Wow. Just... wow. This game. There's no denying it, it's downright intense. Somehow this finale stepped it up a notch from last season's, and things just got tougher. Poor Clem, she's gone through a lot.Also, props to the developers, it seems they tweaked the click-and-drag mechanic to be a little more responsive. Thank you for that.If there is a third season release, I'm definitely getting it. This series produces such a feeling of raw realism, and never shies away from the gritty reality that life s*cks. The quality behind the storytelling far surpasses many interactive games I've seen, and definitely wouldn't mind taking another crazy ride on this franchise. Well done, Tell Tale Games. Well done."

The game won several awards and was a big enough hit to warrant another season.And sure enough, TWD:S2 is one of Telltale's best efforts so far, handily beating The Wolf Among Us in my eyes. However, it doesn't reach the greatness of Season One, lacking the finesse and emotional impact of its predecessor. But hell, I don't even know if that's a fair comparison, since TWD:S1 was such a perfect storm of story, tone and dialogue.In its defense, The Walking Dead: Season 2 still kept me glued to my screen whenever a new episode was released, but part of the novelty was gone. Both literal and figurative growing pains could be detected with the formula getting a bit predictable at points.Some of the characters you got to know even a bit too well, since at least I had pretty much already chosen my path before heading to the climatic season finale - The supposedly impossible decisions I had to make at the end of all things were actually the easiest ones in the whole series. I was left with a bit of hollow feeling, but I guess that's partially the point.Anyhow, TWD:S2 is definitely recommended for the fans of Season One. It doesn't pack the punch of the original, but continues an interesting storyline with a deft enough hand that kept at least me entertained. Roll on Season Three."

The story's explanations of what events happened between Episode 1 and 2 are vague and unsatisfying, at best.  The season also introduces too many new characters, and not much time is spent developing them.  That means that even though they're good characters overall, it's hard to become attached to them or care much about their fates.  The game also, for the most part, doesn't force you to make the same kinds of difficult moral decisions, and at times it all feels very rail-roady. The season has a good build-up through episode 3, but then seems to suddenly loose it's focus in the 4th.  I was prepared for a disappointing finale, but...The positives: the finale episode was fantastic, and easily my favorite episode in the whole franchise.  It's climax is unforgettable, and unlike the last season there are multiple very distinct endings.  These endings vary in quality a bit, but overall they are very satisfying.  Unlike the numerous side characters, the main characters, including Clem, are very well-done and memorable.  Although the quality of the episodes varies a lot, with episodes 1 and 4 being the weakest, the season is overall very good, and certainly worth playing.seems to lose it's directiondirection, especially during the second halfThe final episode as a whole is what saves this season from being mediocre."

Spoiler Free.You play as Clementine, a 8 yr old girl, you swore to protect in the First game while playing as her guardian, and protector Lee Everett. It's been over a year, since the events of the First game. You now  play as Clemetine. You see Clem and whats left of the group struggling to survive, when you get seperated and are all by yourself. You come across this new group. They take you in, and you are once again, with a larger group. You travel with this group, trying to surive the walkers, but not  just them. Your biggest threat this whole game, are other survivors. Who will you trust? Who would you trust with your life? Is that person suspicious? All questions you will be asking yourself? You will bond with your new group members, but also must deal with arguements on whats best for the group? What should yall do next? I will say though that they rely on you (Clementine) Wayyyyyyy too much for everything. I mean your 9 yrs old, yet they want you to do everything while they sit around, or can't come up with a answer. But Anyways. Death is of course inadvoidable for anyone in this game. This game gets you with the unsuprising. Consider this next paragraph a spoiler.Let me go on a quick rant here. TellTale really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off with this one. ANYONE THAT YOU CAN SAVE WHEN YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO. THEY JUST DIE ANYWAY. ""Oh you saved that guy"" alright we'll just keep em around till next episode, barely give them any dialogue and kill them next episode"" - TellTaleIt's been that way ever since once certain death that can happen back in the first game of Ep. 4. And the way they die to, just makes zero sense, they happen so quick, not even the survivors get suprised or show really any emotion to these certain characters.Back to the game. Choices still matter in the game. I mean your no Lee Everett so you'll be treated like a little girl (which pisses me off sometimes). The dialogue with the characters is still good and interesting. The story is still pretty amazing (Thank you TellTale). New gameplay is put in, most of it from the 400 days dlc back on the first one. I will say though, gameplay is rather low than even of how much was in the first game. You'll probably go 10 minutes of dialogue at the start of each episode before you yourself are actually allowed to move and investigate objects and other stuff. In the End, I still like the first game way more, but this game was a good sequel for a awesome game. A season 3 has already been confirmed and I'm stoked for it. Just TellTale. Even if we have the chance to Let a character die or not. If we CHOOSE TO SAVE THEM. Give them some more dialogue or screen time. 9/10"

I have followed the TV series closely and am in awe of how well they show the human condition to the world. I feel so let down by the ending of the game. It's was so sudden and awkward and Jane did not need to die.Kenny also would'nt have walked off into the sunset so easily. He would have fought for his right to live and survive as they do in the TV series. He was a survivor. He watched his wife and son die, but still he carried on, as any of us would hope to. We all aspire to be as strong of will as Kenny was and to keep fighting in the face of incredible odds.Also why did'nt Jane say anything about switching the babies.

For those that have played season 1, this season starts off slow but that's typical becasue this game doesn't take shortcuts--it builds a story. Perhaps, it's biggest strength became evident mid-way through S2-ep2. You don't have the abiity to call the shots directly anymore, with the certainty of Lee. As Clem you have to show your leadership from a much different angle.

Filled with dramatic moments, survival instincts, and grey area decisions, the game brought out the inner terror within in you.  However, I was wrong.  Season 2 has EVERYTHING the 1st season had to offer but has taken it up a notch by cleverly putting the fate of this season in the palm of a 12 year old girls hands.  Epic story telling and in your face reality sums it up."

This episode is by far the greatest episode, TellTale Games has ever developed in 'The Walking Dead' game series. It was such an impressive and intelligent episode that helped bring emotion, fear and excitement to a whole different level. I had to make really tough choices during this episode and I had to go back to witness what else would've happenend. I'm satisfied with my first playthrough choices and I would like to keep it that way when Season Three will be released!The character relationships were so powerful during this episode that it was hard to pick who to rely on the most out of everyone in the group. I'm not mentioning any names but quite a few main characters died during my playthrough. Clementine has really grown into a mature little girl and I respected her for what she became during this episode.I was really impressed with the character developments of Clementine, Kenny and Jane. The voice acting was phenominal and TellTale Games decided to pick a great opportunity to show a scene of Clementine with Lee back in Season One.Thank you so much TellTale Games for developing such a brilliant game and I strongly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played this game yet! I would strongly recommend playing Season One first before Season Two! You will not be disappointed..."

The conflictions internally about what to do with characters, inject yourself into situations, and let things play out is as heart shattering as it is empowering.

,Recommended,261030,12100262,"Posted: 14 September, 2014",all,malkav11,"This review is written with season one in mind. There is really no sense in playing this if you have not already experienced season one as it is a continuation of that story and there are a number of things that will be less resonant without that experience.In general, season 2 continues the formula that Telltale pioneered in the first season, providing a series of tough choices interspersed with action sequences powered primarily by QTEs and relationship-building conversations with other survivors. There's less adventure-game style puzzling and the game flow is, I think, better off for it, although it certainly does a great deal to divorce the experience from traditional mechanics-oriented gameplay. There still  isn't really a great deal of long term impact from most of the choice points, although this is understandable given how complex the design problem is when including even the limited amount of branching that does exist. Still, as in season one (and The Wolf Among Us), Telltale does a great job of making the choices feel impactful and personalized even if subsequent playthroughs would reveal little to no genuine impact. My advice with these games? Play them once and once only. Ensure a story that's personal to your experience, and leave it at that. If you feel that diminishes the value to you, well, wait for a sale.I do feel like this season is a bit weaker overall. The first season had a fairly clear narrative arc and a strong central relationship to define it. We still have a strong central character (arguably unrealistically strong, given her age, but this did not bother me the way it did some), but the cast of characters does quite a bit more rotating here, with only the PC present from the beginning to end, and there's less reason to connect with most of them, so it's not quite as impactful when they die or leave. On the other hand, for me this led me to behave in a somewhat more mercenary way, selecting characters to work with and support at least as much because of their value to long term survival as because I liked them or wanted to keep everyone together and alive. And I was much more inclined to regard new people as possible threats rather than a welcome sight. I felt this was a compelling demonstration of the effect this sort of bleak survivalist scenario has on one's morality and worldview. I certainly was invested enough in the narrative to feel the presumably desired emotions on certain reveals and encounters, and I absolutely looked forward to each episode as they came out.In conclusion, I would definitely recommend Walking Dead Season Two to fans of the first season (and not to those who weren't), but I would temper your expectations a bit. Lightning did not -quite- strike twice, but it's still another helping of almost everything that was good about the first one."

The story is less conclusive and more prepatory for the next season instead of start-to-finish, however it did touch on some interesting issues and made you commit to difficult decisions.

Simply because I have soo much respect for the WD universe.As a REAL HardCore fan of WD, I can only rate this game with no more than a 7.5 out of 10...

It's hard for me to tell when the decisions Clementine made were her's, and which ones were mine; and I think thats the best part. I know little of what the inevitable zombie apocalpyse, but I suspect that the depiction here is probably as accurate as I'd expect our race to become.Season two feels like the tale of how monsters are made, and how they are redeemed or brought to justice. It is beautiful, human, and inherently yours. If you played season 1, you owe it yourself to continue your story."

But I feel cheated at the end of this. Wanted more. Played Season 2 until one possible end."

I must say that the story and presentation is good and you will be easily drawn in. The chacters stand out from one another and you will be really caring about how they end up. The choices are meaningful and shape the chacters you are playing. Although most of the time the story will just go as planned no matter how your choice is made, the process is different and make you feel you are really deciding something. Just don't be hoping there will be 20 different endings.The gameplay is very basic. Just walk around, talk to people, touch things, press the button at the right time.

Yes.Telltale made the smart choice and made a story that is very different from Season 1--the groundbreaking and timeless story that is Season 1 cannot be replicated. Or, it just so happened that Clementine is the opposite of Lee, so there.By the time I got to episode 5, in the character moments, I actually thought ""yea... we earned this."" the relationships between the characters grow naturally without ""dialogue timeouts"" that feel unnatural. They change over time, and it feels...right.So overall the storytelling in the game is wonderful. However, there are some logical fallacies and you're supposed to just accept them as people being irrational in face of a zombie apocalypse. Desperation. I don't know if it works...Now, there is probably going to be backlash from people about how it ended, but I applaud Telltale for sticking with a vision and seeing it through.Play through it choice by choice, resist the temptation to rewind. Your experience will certainly be memorable."

The story is not as dynamic as they would lead you to believe, in that you can make decisions that should result in a completely different outcome, but you always seem to end up in the same places and general situations.  Additionally, it is frustrating when you purchase a game and are told you have to wait for the majority of it to be made without there being sufficient notice of that before you shelled out the money.  In this case, the issue isn't that they are giving you a beta game like is frequently now happening on Steam, but they simply haven't made all the content yet.  At some point the content will all be there, but they should wait to sell the game until it's complete.  I feel a bit cheated because of it."

The emotional connection you form with the characters of the story just to have it ripped away from you keeps you coming back for more, By far would recommended playing both season 1 and 400 days before touching this however still a very enjoyable experience without it. This and season 1 is my best video game series to date and thats by far a mean feat going up against the likes of the Warcraft franchise, Starcraft, FInal Fantasy, Legend Of Zelda etc.I would highly recommended this to any gamer who enjoys a top notch story with compelling enough gameplay to keep you enjoying the high level of story content. This game is my game of the year by far. However for the FULL experience i would suggest playing through the first season, you don't need to experience the 400 days DLC but without the first season it will be much harder for you to really connect with the storyline.Highly recommended, First Season playthrough a real must to enjoy it to its fullest, Another masterclass from telltale games 10/10 game of the year from me"

I was very excited to see Clem again and see how she had changed and handled the loss of life and the dangers that surround her. This second season was extremely fun to me and really brought to my attention how such simple gameplay but compelling story can really take me away into a different world.Each chapter seemed well executed and really stepped up the kinds of dilemmas you can find yourselves in. It really highlights what i like most and thats the morally grey areas. There isn't always a right and wrong and there isn't always a good and bad. Do you help people? Do you trust people? Its survival of the fittest but at what risk? do you compromise your humanity too much in order to survive? or too little and barely make it through?It didn't quite tug on my heartstrings like the first season did but there were some really moving moments involving a flashback to lee some familiar faces and my particular ending.Man that first season was just golden in my mind. Maybe its the fact i had all the chapters and played it through in one go. Maybe its that i miss Lee, it feels like nothing can touch how great that experience was. This game i feel like i was evolving and becoming numb to the world around me just like Clementine in my game.

There are moments when I felt characters acted completely out of character with how the game had built them up over the episodes, leaving the various endings feeling a bit off.If you're hoping for tough gameplay where you feel in danger constantly you might be disappointed - yes there are dangerous situations, but you're never really in any danger of screwing up and dying.

She was a tactical specialist, a hardened killer, a wise leader, she had a talent for parleys, she knew many languages, including Russian, she could convert an enemy to make him loyal to her.But that never helped, since people in her group were mindless, doing before they think or doing exactly the opposite of what Clementine tells them to. Even zombies have a brighter mind, that is.And instead of dominating the post-apocalyptic world with her personal army constantly growing, or building a rather safe base to rebuild the society, or going for endless frag-rampage, she now ended up in♥♥♥♥♥♥ What's the logic?

Sort of reminding of japanese visual novels, it combines point-and-click genre with well-acted voicing and western-style, comic-ish digital cinematography.For all its good looks, and deep and rich storyline, as player you are very limited. RPG in this game manifests itself only as a maximum of 4 choices in dialogue, each theoretically navigating the story line in as basic directions as east, south, west, and north; of course, combined with other choices you made, evolving into diverse outcomes. Also, there is the matter of restriction to movement, the physical control of the character; but then again, considering the genre, you kind of expect it to be so.So, it could have been better since they have had experience from the first game, thus should have improved this one a bit more. Though all in all, it's a solid good game. Breaking the general let-down rule in such game sequels, Season 2 wins your heart right out, like Season 1, provided you liked the prequel.

The little bit of change in the game style is interesting but not that different that it makes a huge difference. Actually, for most of the little ""click here and drag"" instead of just click to do something they've been kind of annoying.The problem I found with this game was that it didn't feel as though my decisions actually influenced the game at all. I've been waiting for something that i decided earlier on in the game to come back and bite me in the♥♥♥♥♥ which happened quite a bit in the last game, but nothing like that has come up so far. In the previous game, everytime that little notice on the screen that said ""Kenny will remember that"" I spent the next twenty minutes thinking ""♥♥♥♥, now Kenny is going to let me die instead of him because I picked Lee over his kid, goddammit Kenny"", and that was half of the fun I found in the last one.

Season 2 is more polished, has better acting, and gets you more involved emotionally.  Characters are more supprising, situations far less predictable, and even though you are just a little girl, there are some very tuff decisions to make in season 2, even more so than in season 1.

I finished season 1 in November of 2013 (and 400 days as soon as it came out).I wasn't sure how this game was going to work, playing clementine instead of an adult but that definitely grew on me. It seems like the engine has improved several times over since season 1 in the play-ability (any chance season 1 can be played with season 2's engine? Probably not).The only real criticism I can think of is that it has kind of a middle-of-trilogy vibe to it. By which I mean it seemed much shorter, it continued a prior story line and left the story line wide open at the end, like it's just here to connect the first part to the third part (of what I can only assume to be a trilogy).That's not necessarily a bad thing though. The job of a middle thing is to convince the reader/player/viewer to want to see the next one, and that it definitely did do that for me. I'd still rather wait for the whole season though.I'm envisioning Clementine taking a Lee-like role and AJ being the season one Clementine type character in season 3. That's kind of predictable so I kind of hope it's something else.I did notice at least one consequence from ""400 days"" but it's been long enough I assume I just didn't see them all (it was very subtle).Oh, and I do want to go back and re-play both seasons from scratch.

The second season has started off with a huge grab of the attention span and I am hoping that it continues through out. Clementine is a great tie in/continuation of the story from season one.  The tension you have created is neck muscle tighteningly good. On to Ch.2 8/5 /10Having just finished Chapter 2, I can say that the story is just getting better. I am finding that the number of critical decisions did not seem to be as heavy in Ch 2 (perhaps just my perception) and some of the right left up down decisions were a little obvious but I am still very taken by the plot and the involved and evolving storyline. Clementine is still an excellent foil for human emotion, being a child and  supposedly being a minor and without true adult understanding. The reintroduction of an old character is very well done. On to Ch. 3. 8.5/10Ok, Ok.......I am just gonna say this. I WANTED TO KILL THAT M2%$#@@$#%^&&%!@#$$^^^%#! myself. Nice work! You, the programmers and artists that made this game have consistently overcome my total boredom with the whole Zombie theme! Most Excellent .On to Ch. 4. 8.5/10Chapter 4 was a great bit of story telling. The emotional pull of a Trusted Friend  leaving and one in serious trouble, a major burden unleashed on people already on the edge of self destruction. Very well scripted. Found myself shouting ""No, no ...."" more than once. Clementine is a formidable character, and the choices presented often make me wish I could ask for several more options, or at least a couple more seconds to decide. God, my neck muscles are tense. On to Ch. 5. 8.75/10I regret nothing. Survival is paramount and the weak and incapable must be expunged. Whoooooo. Sorry. Got carried away.This game is excellent. Excellent in almost every aspect. My earlier gripes about obvious controls is so minor. The story is absolutely gripping. I suppose it is because the main protagonist is a very well written exploration of the human psyche and often the choices presented draw upon a very moral (or immoral) choice of action. Do you stay where you are or do you help the group? It does not become stale though. I found myself pondering a restart of the entire chapter about 3/4 of the way through, simply because of one bad(?) decision made in the heat of the moment. So much more worth my attention span and money than the TV show. Very well done Telltale. Please hurry with Season 3. 8.75/10"

,Recommended,261030,11913549,"Posted: 29 August, 2014",all,Jill Sandwich,"The question that I think is important to ask is ""Is it fair to judge this by the standard of Season 1?"" I won't waste space debating that answer, but it's something to consider.Season 2 differs in its style in a big way from Season 1. Which style you prefer will be entirely up to personal preference and what it is you value in a narrative and in characterization. Or, perhaps, just what you enjoy ""seeing"" on screen.Telltale has done a commendable job at trimming the fat of the monotony of some point n' click sequences, but often this comes at the expense of further character development. I appreciate the lack of Myst like ""click here click there"" sequences that kept the pacing of the story quick and riveting, but I also found myself pining for the more nuanced and personal relationship to the characters that I was able to develop in Season 1. I think it is telling that Season 1 took me several days to finish, both literally and emotionally, and that Season 2 took me a mere night at the computer.Season 2 is full of thrills and chills, but they often feel forced, or rushed. They lack the scope of Season 1 in many ways. This makes them no less gruesome or shocking, but it does leave you less impacted as a player, and that was something I cherished about Season 1.The presence of some characters in Season 2 seemed trivial, and other times downright annoying. There were some characters that shined, but their development seems stunted or worse: nonexistant. Also, the presence of some tropes from the comics and shows felt a little cheesy. Some characters could have been re-writes from Season 1. The same person in a different body.Don't take this as me saying you shouldn't play this game. If you are a fan of The Walking Dead you should. If you loved Season 1 for all of its flaws as a ""game"" but excellent vision as a story-telling device then you might walk away from this one feeling a little jaded like I did.The voice acting is still superb as are the individual lines of writing.  The game looks even better than it did in Season 1 imo. The score is still pretty good and doesn't intrude on the drama. As I said before, Telltale has cleaned up the gameplay of the point n' click considerably here and tried in what little ways you can with this genre to make the ""playing"" more interesting. That's appreciated.Overall this wasn't bad, but it failed to leave me hungry for more. I'm far more excited for the TV show this fall than the next installation of this game series, though I will undoubtedly play it.Since I can't give this game a real score and can only ""recommend it"" or not, then I will go ahead and say, yeah, this is worth a playthrough. Just don't expect Season 1. If you're more into non-stop chills and thrills though then you will probably be striking gold here."

As in the first season, you will be thinking in a sometimes uncomfortable way about what your values are, and how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you may be (and the game will be tellig you that bt comparing your choices with the choices of other players).Some parts of the story feel a bit cheap because they are clearly put there on purpose to make you feel sad in a clumsy way, and I think I generally prefered the first season. But this game still tells an overly good story which I recommend. It's interesting and generally not much predictable.The technology and the overall visual style might need a bit of refresh; although the comics style is still a great idea and the characters faces look good, some other parts such as scenary and landscape do ont always look great. The game would benefit of an improvement in this matter and this was not improved since the first season.Regarding gameplay, I note an improvement since it is now easier to aim with a gamepad. Less precision is indeed required to aim at targets, and even though the game asks you to use the right trigger of the 360 pad to activate things, it will also accept you pressing the A button. This is actually what I do half the time by mistake, especially in tense moments. By comparison in the first season it was really a pain for me to succeed in the zombie shooting scenes with the pad (I never play with a pad except in a handful of games) and I used to take my mouse to go past these. This is no longer necessary."

So I would recommend this quick time event/point & click game to anyone during a sale and it might be worth full price for hardcore fans of story games who like to playthrough multiple times.  The game's story & world is mostly linear but has some paths that determine some characters' behavior, character involvement in story, but they don't really change a lot about what ultimately happens or locations where major plot points happen.  This allows Telltale to bring immense character and story depth that is even better than and builds on Season 1, which I recommend playing before S2, but it isn't absolutely necessary.  The interface is a little better, although the buttons for run & inventory items had no use for me the entire time.Be warned that this season is more physically & emotinoally brutal on all characters than the first, so it is not for the faint of heart or squeemish, so know that anything can happen to any character at anytime.  They increase the shock factor but plausibly nearly the entire time.  There were only 1 or 2 instances where I thought to myself that the recovery or lack of severity were too convenient.  I am eager for future seasons though and I don't think TWD has jumped the shark yet."

One moment they were wanting to coddle her because she is a little girl. The next moment they were asking her to make very adult decisions and do very adult things on her own.Second, and this has nothing to do with the creators of the game and much more to do with me, but I MISS LEE and even though the game and game play are stellar, the fact that Lee is gone does diminish the game in tone somewhat.Third, I do feel like there was a TON of time spent in dialogue, where characters just stand around and talk to each other.

In Season 2 there is no relationship as strong as Lee and Clementine's was in season 1, but that allowed for Clementine to grow close, then apart, from other characters. The cast changed more often than it did in Season 1 as well. In Season one there was the basic cast of Lee, Clementine, Kenny, Katjaa, and Duck for over half the season, in this game, only three characters (other than Clementine) stuck around for that long, and the third character(Rebecca, though that is admittedly just an opinion), didn't make much of an impression till about episode three he/she was just kind of there.Seeing the world through Clementine's eyes also is a major difference from the previous season. Wheras Lee was an adult, an ex con, and very experienced in the ways of the world, Clementine is not. She's a little kid. While that was a fascinating perspective to choose, and it definitely impacted the choices I made, it did make parts of the game seem ridiculous. The entire game various people task Clementine with insane responsibilities. ""Talk Kenny down."" "" Watch the perimiter"" ""Pull that full grown man out of that big hole."" Many characters act at times like they have completely forgotten that Clementine is no older than thirteen (The amount of time that has passed since the game began is unspecific), then at other times, they talk about how she's a little kid, and shouldn't have to live like they do. Perhaps this hypocrisy was an intentional decision by the game designers, but at times it did break the immersion of the game for just a moment. Other than the strange tasks being asigned to Clementine, playing as her worked incredibly well. Over the course of the game, you watch her transform from a girl who is largely the same as we left her, into someone who grew up fast out of necessity.The story is quite good, and though it has some slow moments, those are just as enjoyable as the more action packed segments (moreso, in my opinion the game is at its best when Clementine is interacting with the rest of the cast at a slow moment) . As in the previous season, one episode included a villain, and while he may not have been as outright terrifying as the Cannibals from the last season, he was more realistic, and caused more tension in the group. Which is where the truly great storytelling in this game came from, the conflicts within the group kept a sense of tension going throughout the game. The story is not, in any way, cheery. Why anyone would play a game bearing The Walking Dead moniker hoping for a story of hope and possibility is beyond me, but it deserves noting, that like the previous season, the ending will leave you feeling conflicted.The last thing that stands out in my mind is the ending, while I won't spoil it, I will say this about it. Episode 5 hints early on about what the final decision will be. And though it becomes abundandtly clear what it will be well before the end, the choice is still dificult because the game keeps adding wrinkles to the decision before the moment of reckoning comes. The only real complaint that I could make about the ending is that it'snotthe end of the season. There is a very powerful moment, then a short five to ten minute segment that follows it, which tries to give you a hard choice, but the consequences of that choice don't hit as hard as the one you had to make a few minutes ago. The big choice left me in tears, even though I felt I hade made the right decision, the final choice left me feeling slightly uneasy. I would have preferred ending on the more powerful note, but it didn't affect the overall experience too much.I greatly enjoyed this game, and I can't wait until Telltale sends us back to the world of The Walking Dead.9.75/10"

If I was in the writer(s) shoes, I would have used episodes 1-4 as a build-up to the climax that I’m referring to, and then have everything come to a head in episode 5.  The aftermath episodes could then be used as 400 days-type DLC that wraps up the story of Clementine and friends.Not sure how resource allocation works at Telltale, but it seems like they rushed this one out so that they could move on to Tales from the Borderlands and Game of Thrones.

I couldn't escape the sadness of Lee's death.When I saw Kenny in Season 2, I was shocked. He reminded me of Lee. He reminded me of the beautiful relationship that Lee and Clem had in Season 1.I could tell Kenny cared deeply for Clem in a way that none of the other characters did.

A game with some harsh choices to be made, and sometimes you can't always make the right choice and even if you do it still might not turn out the way you want.

Subsequently the characters are lousy.Without good writing TWD Season 2 fails at making me get invested in their characters. It gives us more action sequences, cheap deaths, violence... but these things are not what made TWD Season 1 so memorable to me. It was relationships. Primarily one strong relationship. This type of element to the game that made you care about what was going on isn't in Season 2. I need a reason to care about these people or it's just another B movie horror survival story.It's instead stuffed to the brim with characters who you'll know will die, who we learn little about, who are all emotionally unstable and irrational, who depend on a little mary sue to do everything, it's all to shallow.Season 1 had me invested in the characters. Kept playing through because I just had to know what happens.I played Season 2 for Clemetine. Was thoroughly let down, Finished it so I could ""get it over with"". I shouldn't have bothered.This series went in a different direction that makes TWD world even more evil and cold without likable characters and relationships I can get invested in. I don't care to support this series if they plan on continuing it. Other negative reviews cover in detail many things and I can say that I generally agree with the lot of them."

It's been debated about online, some for, some against, some don't care, but I'm inline with the view that this is an in-your-face way for the creators to try to gain acknowledgement for their work.

,Recommended,261030,13833241,"Posted: 4 January, 2015",all,Greendotz,"Those who played the first Walking Dead will know that ultimately your choices don’t actually matter. Sure depending on what you do certain people will stick around or leave/die and peoples dialog will be friendly or hostile depending on your earlier responses, but the key story events will always be the same no matter what you pick. But that’s why I loved the first game, it wasn’t about how you changed the story, but more a reflection of yourself. I would make choices and instantly regret them, and know I’d have to shoulder those choices for the rest of the game. It was a great experience.Which leads us onto season 2. Firstly let’s talk about what’s good about the game. I’m just going to keep it simple and say if you like the first one there’s absolutely no reason not to get the second, it continues the gripping story, visuals are improved and the gameplay is as good as it ever was. There’s also much more difficult choices to make in this one, it seemed that there were more middle-of-the-road choices in the first game but this one will put you in situations where a side must be picked, which adds to the tension and suspense of the story.Unfortunately it’s not completely faultless, it’s the same formula as season 1, but now that I am aware of the illusion of choice that the game offers it does feel slightly less special.  Although in season 1 the ultimate outcomes were always the same you still felt that your choices mattered. There are some “major” choice events in season 2, I won’t mention them due to spoilers but they are apparently big enough to be considered in the statistics summary at the end (where your choices are compared to everyone else that’s played the game). Yet these ‘choices’ actually have zero effect on the game, they don’t change the course of the story in anyway and some of them don’t even have an effect on dialogue. I also felt like I was been shoehorned into liking certain characters and hating others, without been allowed to choose for myself. The writing lacked a lot of subtlety that the first game had and it was really frustrating that for almost an entire chapter I was been offered choices that didn’t reflect what I was thinking at all. I also disliked how quickly characters attitudes could change so drastically after one event. It made me feel like all the ground word I’d made before then counted for nothing, though this is just a small criticism as I suppose it’s fitting with the setting of the game.The big saving grace here is the ending, there are a around 3 to 4 major choices you have to make in the last five minutes of the game that really show what kind of person Clementine (and by extension, you) have become by the end of this journey. While the first game was an emotional roller-coaster this one is considerably more melancholy, you probably won’t feel great by the end of it, but in my opinion that’s the sign of good writing. You’re really drawn into the despair that’s left behind in this shattered world.Also as you can probably see from my play time at the time of writing this review it’s a very short game, with little-to-no replay value in my opinion. I did two replays of the first game and found them both to be pointless, in fact it actually ruins the game a little as you see just how little your choices actually matter. Just enjoy the game for what it is, an immersive story that’ll make you question your own ethics and morality. For fans of the series/genre it’s a no-brainer, get this game. For those who are a little unsure but still interested in completing the story you may want to hold out for a steam deal."

I was hugely disappointed by it.First of all Season 2 is more like an interactive movie than a point&click adventure but that doesn't bother me so much. As the previous season it has a lot of QTE and unskippable dialogue that are ok to me but I can see why people may not enjoy it and probably get bored.My main dissapoint by the way is how the choices you make don't affect too much the game as the preovious season. Do you want to save that character because you care? He/she will probably die whatever you choose and that's it, nobody will ever mention him/her and the life goes on. Have you choose to going in that way instead of the other? No problem, you'll end there anyway.That's my main problem: you literally have little control on the story if none. That's a huge shame and I hope in an eventual Season 3 they fix this. As I said I love the story but I don't want that my choices are relegate in small lines of dialogue that may or may not dissapoint a secondary character in that situation and then forget about it.

But that is literaly why I marked it down by .1.-[SPOILERS] In Season One, we were introduced to many characters, only for them to die (bar Kenny). Same thing in Season 2 (apart from Mike and Bonnie). All the Cabin crew. I wouldn't be too surprised if in Season 3 we were introduced to eight different characters, only for all eight to die. There was certain characters that lacked development (Alvin, Carlos, etc).[NO SPILERS] One thing I was really IMPRESSED about was the final decision. You have to choose to save either ********** or **********. You choose one, and then choose whether or not to stay or leave with that character. But the fact is that you CAN choose to stay with them. If you stay with them, you have lots of different stories branching off.Once Telltale don't do something stupid and kill the character you chose to stay with (if you chose to stay w/ them), Season 3 looks to be good, and I might even mark S2 9.5/10, because one of my major choices mattered."

Let me just give you an example, there is a new inventory mechanic this time around and I don't remember using it at all, it is there, you can toggle it, but I never had to use it. It's just more dialog and button mashing, but this time the dialog options have little to no effect over the story, at the end you end up with the different cut seen depending on the very last 2 decisions in the last 3-5min of the game, THAT’S IT!I feel like the developers were so focused on telling the story that they forgot about the ""game"" element. It reached a point where the only ""gaming"" elements that were left were the ""shooting gallery"" sections.Let's not even talk about the fact that they make a 10 or 11 year old girl shoot a full ammo clip in a row, beyond it being unrealistic, I feel that they could have found a more interesting plot that didn't involve making Clem a Rambo Junior.I actually re-winded the game and opted for the opposite choices from the previous play trough and it was just pathetic. The last game you could sometimes get somebody killed or choose who to keep in the team, this time they might as well just used a “press any key to continue” mechanic.So if you are a real fan of ""the walking dead"", the story is ok.... really just....ok.... but you are better off watching it on YouTube and save your money for a real game."

Although it wasn't nearly as emotionally impactful as TWD:S1 was for me, it was still a worthy continuation of the original and as such well worth my time, effort and coin.While it could be argued that this title suffered from some sophomore slump, and those wouldn't be wholly incorrect, I feel as though Telltale Games set themselves up for this inevitable ""failure"" by producing such a good original product.  It would have been difficult to surpass the level of impact the story telling had in TWD:S1, but only because I clamored for that largely unexpected impact from TWD:S2.  I didn't expect TWD:S1 would make me choke up and my eyes to well, or to feel sick to my stomach for the decisions I had to make, but it did and that prepared me for what was to come, much as a survivor in this zombie infested world might become jaded toward its horrors.  Simply put, I was prepared this time, but that isn't to say I wasn't caught off guard a time or two this go around.For me the games are equals in regards to storytelling, design, graphics and gameplay, this second installment just suffered a little from my knowing what to expect in regards to ""the feels"".  If you played the first season and enjoyed it, I'm confident you'll enjoy this as well.  If you didn't like the first season, what are you even doing here?  If you haven't played the first, what are you even doing here?  Go play it now and then come back to TWD:S2 and play it then."

,Recommended,261030,16583321,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,[SAS]Macif,"The Walking Dead: Season 2 picks up right where season 1 of the series ends. This time around we see the entire game through Clementine's eyes, something that really brings a new aspect to the entire series so far, if you ask me. After all, in many games we always play as an adult, especially in many games with survival and horror elements. So we get a different perspective with a child as the playable character. She has clearly been affected by the events of the last game, but the little girl soldiers on.Through the entire game Clementine is challenged a lot. All from making those signature difficult choices that we remember from the last game, and also who to stay loyal with and so on. With all of these things we also get the emotional baggage that some of these choices causes. Some may feel that the game doesn't offer all that many choices like we remember from the last game, but it certainly has a good story, something that I feel defends the reason to why there aren't perhaps that many choices for everybody's liking.From the first episode I could tell that Telltale Games put their hearts into the game and the result is of course of pure Telltale quality. If you enjoyed the previous game then you will love this a lot more. So go ahead and be a good sport. :) Click add to cart and enjoy the adventures emotional rollercoaster that this game offers.Positive points:+ The story is excellent+ Hard choices+ You can import your save from the previous season+ The graphics are good, with the classic comic style from season 1+ Multiple endings+ Good voice actors that fit the characters+ Old friends appearNegative points:+ May have too little choices for some+ You may cry from the story (I don't find this negative, but some might)"

I had to find work arounds, including breaking my immersion in-game by making decisions that didn't fit with who I wanted my character to be, in order to keep it from crashing. Currently stuck in an 8-times-replayed crash trap and cannot complete the game. Only buy this game during a significant sale, or if you are prepared to possibly deal with extreme bugginess.(NO SPOILERS)I thoroughly enjoyed the first Walking Dead game, and like many others, it brought me to tears in the end because the story was so beautifully written. This sequel to the first game also brings me to tears. The reason not being the beautiful choice-based storyline, but rather the fact that I have experienced numerous crashes that take me completely out of the immersive gameplay.I have tried just about everything to combat this: Changing graphics resolution, playing in-window instead of full screen, taking completely different choice paths because they appear less buggy (I didn't want to make the in-game decisions that I had to, but they were necessary as a ""work around"" to the frequent crashing), and the uninstall-reinstall of the game. Some of these have been temporary fixes, and have gotten me all the way to the 3rd chapter of the 6th episode.The issue is, now it seems I can no longer progress to the finale of this game. At the point where you are tasked with getting a couple members of your group to come back next to the fire, every time I move on to convince the second person (no matter who I choose first) the game will crash. This part is at the end of chapter 3, and every time it crashes, I have to start from the beginning of the chapter and sit through about 10 minutes of decision making. I have played through this part 8 times now, and every time it crashes.As stated before, I don't think that there is any work around for this one, and I will not be able to complete this game. This is a complete shame, because the entire rest of The Walking Dead: Season 2 is wonderful, and takes you on the series' famed emotional ups and downs. But there will probably be no closure for me, and others, with this story line."

Sure, this things need to be done by the player, otherwise there would'nt be anything to do. But this does not work for Clementine. They just took the concept they had for Lee in season 1 and put it on Clem. That. does. not. work. It's unlikely, and that is sad. Could have been much better.2. Decisions: You think, you decide how the story goes on? You are wrong! Only the very last two decisions of the very last episode have an influence on the ending. All other decision do barely change anything. sure, sometimes a follow-up scene goes a little bit different, but the result will always be the same. And as soon as you have realized this, you stop to care. that woul have not been so bad, if Telltale would not claim, that the game adjust to the decisions the player makes. It does not!3. Characters: Honestly, most of them were indifferent to me. Characters in Season 1 were so much better and so much mre connected to me, that I didn't even care, if one of the died.4. Skipping: Why can't I skip the credits or scenes? That's annoying, especially if you want to replay a scene.So, do I recommend the game? I do because of the ends, but still the thumb goes down. Because Telltale can do it better and I want them to do it better the next time! Especially I want to have the feeling, it REALLY matters what I do (was good on season 1, but bad on GOT and TWAU). And I don't want to play the super tough Killer- girl, I want to protect the little girl! Please do it better next time! I know you can!"

There is only 2 season 1 characters in this season, so it really is a completley different story. Clementines 11, meaning she's matured to the extent that she handles many crucial decisions and learns from her experience with Lee. She's a great main character and it awesome to see her being a bit of a leader like her old friend.However, I did prefer season 1, but thats no fault of this game, its still amazing and TellTale is becoming one of my favorite game devolopers.

For example you may save a character in one chapter and in the next episode that same character dies pretty much instantly. It's a big F*** you. I enjoy Season 2 way more than the first. Don't get me wrong both have great stories and you will play through the night trying to finish each episode like it's the last. The characters are intense in the wild west of a world called The Walking Dead. Everyone has an agena and it's up to you to keep friends close and your enemies closer. Once all is said and done I feel my excitment for these games ebbying. Now Talltale has announced another TWD game which has nothing to so with the last two Seasons. I may play this one when it's on sale. Really I want them to continue with Season three. Please don't let this be another Half Life 2 episode 3 situation.

If you haven't played Season 1 here is more detailed review:9/10 PointsSo, the gameplay isn't something to get excited about: it's pretty much just point and click, also there is a fair amount of illusion of choice: they say your choices matter but that isn't really the case. I could go into detail why, but that would spoil much of the game - so just trust me illusion of choice plays a big part and it's not done as well as in Season 1, because you can tell when your action doesn't matter.But everything else is ♥♥♥♥ing great: the characters are strong and well written, the story is good and the voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ing great. So if you liked Season 1, you will most likely enjoy Season 2 - if you didn't like Season 1 of the Walking Dead by Telltale than you might consider given Season 2 a try, since you don't realy need Season 1 to have fun in this one - if you like the idea as playing as a eleven year old girl in a zombie apocolypse.So to conclude this into one sentence: If you like a story driven game - with little gameplay - but strong characters and a strong story than this is for you. If you like games where gameplay matters and story and characters aren't that important to you than will most likely not enjoy this game."

What's different about this season is that everything goes, for lack of a better term, to♥♥♥♥♥♥MUCH quicker than last season. You will almost always be on the edge of your seat for the whole playthrough, it's truly that suspenseful. Sometimes, even, you'll be laughing and then fighting the urge to burst in tears.The character development is lacking, though. There are a few characters you'll meet that are here and then gone in a matter of minutes. Even though that's how it works sometimes and there is no way around it, there are characters you'll have met earlier in the season that almost have no backstory whatsoever. It's almost like they showed and then came back 3 episodes later.Overall, this game is definintly a must buy if you're a fan of Telltale Games; Honestly, the whole series itself is a must buy.

I was overall less immersed in the story in season 2. It's frustrating to see characters make non-sensible decisions, not just because they are bad decisions but because it's inconsistent with the personality or motiviations previous established for that character. That made me have a hard time empathizing with many of the new characters introduced in season 2 as they are just acting in a way to move the plot in a certain direction, rather than the plot being driven by who they are. The final conflict in season 2 was particularly frustrating to watch, just felt a bit contrived to me.There are still some very good moments in the game, and a couple really funny scenes. To be fair I think it's still a pretty decent game but not as good as season 1. I assume they will be making season 3 so I would still recommend season 2 if you like TWD universe and hope they can improve the writing to season 1 quality again.Spoilers about how I feel about the characters:......Spoilers Below!!......Clementine - I think playing Clementine as the protaganist this time around is fine, I don't think that is why the story was weaker in season 2. She behaves pretty consistent with given how season 1 ended. It's good to see how much she's grown up and matured after what she went through in season 1. I thought episode 1 was really great as it's mainly you by yourself as Clementine trying to survive.Pete - I liked Pete,  I chose to run to Pete over Nick at end of episode 1 and I really enjoyed the cigarette truck scene afterwards.Luke - Luke is like one of the only new characters that behaved consistently and wasn't an idiot or a♥♥♥♥♥♥ So yeah he was one of the strongest character introduced. His unpreventable death was really stupid.Nick - Worthless, almost as bad as Ben from season 1. But at least he's consistently an idiot, serves his purpose as a character so I think it's fine.Rebecca - I hate her. I hope that doesn't make me racist but jesus christ she's a train wreck.Alvin - I liked Alvin. Went out like a badass. Props.Carlos - Carlos was fine, too. Practical, decent person, stands up for himself, but will compromise for his daughter. I actually kinda liked the slapping scene, I could empathize with that situation.Sarah - Hated her, bringing down everybody, worthless. Worse than Ben from Season 1, and just as necessary a character to have for the story, so that's fine.Carver - Literrally hitler.Walter - he was only there for like 1 episode but I liked him a lot. The whole thing with him finding out about what happend to Matthew and his reaction felt realistic, human.Kenny - Really glad to see him again, but boy he's gone bonkers. He was almost as intense even in Season 1 though after Duck's death so it sorta made sense. I still don't like how unreasonable he became at the end.Sarita - Boring character, only there as another trigger for Kenny to get worse.Reggie - He was ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious, loved him, even though he was a brown nosing coward.Bonnie - Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bonnie. I hated her in the 500 days DLC between season 1 and 2, and she manage to make me hate her more in this game. Stop helping and trying to be nice and ♥♥♥♥ everything up I wish you drowned instead of Luke.Mike - Mike was okay, seems reasonable enough. Delivered the ""I'd eat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of that raccoon"" line perfectly. I think in the end where he tries to leave with Bonnie and Arvo didn't make sense though.Troy - A♥♥♥♥♥♥ Best part was when Jane shot him in the♥♥♥♥♥♥Jane - I really really liked Jane until the final conflict. She was a good character, seemed real. Got burned helping her sister, no longer trusts groups and prefers to be alone, her actions made sense given her background. I think she should've made a better decision than trying to set Kenny off. The final conflict was too predictable and the argument between Jane and Kenny in the truck was kinda contrived just to try to make the ending make sense. Anyways I liked her enough still and sided with her in the end.Arvo - F*ck Arvo."

The first 4 episodes are true to the first season with you at times having to make extremely difficult decisions and not always feeling like any of the available options are good. The last episode I felt was thrown together very quickly with very little time spent on events. I think it took me about an hour and a half to complete but it never felt like it gave me enough time to get involved. The ending seemed to come about out of nowhere, and while it seemed to give you a hard morale decision to make, I felt that the lack of consequence blunted this moral dilemma with an extremely disappointing ending (nothing gets wrapped up at all and you get two massive decisions withiin the space of about 2 minutes with no option to fully explore the results of your choices)"

The player takes on the role of Clementine, the child Lee took care of in the first game. While it adds and improves on some aspects of the first game (which was itself, near-flawless), it does perform less well in other ways when compared to its predecessor.I would argue that Season 2 is a more thematically developed game than the first, exploring particularly what it's like to be a child in a post-apocalyptic world, though many characters seem less well developed and more two-dimensional than those in the first game. That's not to say there aren't interesting characters (Jane and Carver spring to mind), ad the game mostly compensates for these less memorable characters by putting them in much more interesting and tricky situations.The moral choices in this game seemed much more difficult to make and tended to have unforseen circumstances. Unlike in the first game, by the end of Season 2, I actually wished I had made a number of different choices in the hope things turned out differently. This was much more interesting and realistic than simple ""cause and effect"" (which, in hindsight, the first game suffered from to some extent).The dialogue interface has changed a little compared to the first game (honestly, I'm not sure which one I prefer), and the act of talking to secondary characters in moments of quiet is virtually absent. While this creates a much faster paced and more realistic-feeling game, this probably contributes more than anything else to the lack of characterisation when compared to the first game.Finally on a side note, if you played the 400 Days DLC for the first game, the return of characters from that game in Season 2 is literally mind-blowing. I would highly recommend picking up that DLC before playing this game.9/10"

I was so conflicted that I replayed the ending several times just to reach all the endings and see the different outcomes. It'll be interesting to see if there's a next episode and how it will pick up where you left off and relate to your choices in episode 2.A MUST BUY for fans of the series and those that enjoyed episode 1.

76561198047867971,Recommended,261030,16643441,"Posted: 23 June, 2015",all,Captain Alex,"Telltale games definitely noticed the issues with the first game, because most of them has been completely removed from this ""sequel""Choices are now more easily visible, many of the action orientated elements of the first game has been replaced with Quick Time Events in shape of movement arrows you have to react to whenever they pop up.The only issue I have with this, is that it's simply too easy to avoid failure.One of the more interesting factors of the first game was that your failures would sometimes pave the way for what happened in the game, and this made for some more organic choice branching, whereas with this second instalment, I felt in control at all times.As I addressed in the first game, the absolutely fury-inducing excessive interactions with useless things/people has been completely trimmed, almost too much in fact.This means you will not be stuck at any point ever again. It's always very clear what you have to do, and whom to talk to.I want this review to be absolutely bare minimum on spoilers, but obviously I have to comment on the fact that you now play as Clementine, which is a bit of a spoiler.You see, Lee was a grown dude, and a big one at that, so his physical capability was often something that would come into play as you progressed. With Clementine however, you have to rely on wits and maybe the gullible nature of some more ""pure"" people.It's undeniable however that an 11 year old girl can only do so much physically.There is an interesting new approach to the character, because she has been hardened at this point.Clementine is no longer a scared little girl, in fact her courage often surpasses that of grown men.In terms of what development you can make with the character, you now have the option of playing a much more cynical, angry Clementine. And who could possibly blame her?As for myself I chose to stick to the good pure spirited Clementine we had come to know in the first ""season"".I must admit however, I feel like going with the more hardened, cynical approach would have been the more realistic choice, and trust me, you get plenty of opportunities to excercise those nasty kind of choices, or be a hero, if that's what you want.It's as though, the developers wanted the story to be much easier to control this time around, but I do feel like the evident ""this is what it would look like if it was up to the writers"" appeal is more clear than ever.As a result, I sort of felt that the story and therefore, the game, played itself way too often.Maybe I will go for a second playthrough, maybe I won't, but if I do, I wanna make sure that I get to play out my choices with a character that has been broken in mind, rather than the sugar sweet, steriotypical hero.I highly recommend you give this some thought as well, because otherwise you just might end up slightly disappointed, just like myself.Clementine has a lot of emotional value to me and most likely everyone else that played season 1, but I can't help, but feel that she didn't make for the best kind of main character.7.5/10"

It is a bit weird to play with Clem in the beginning, certainly when making the choices from your own mindset (unless you're a 12 year old, I can imagine it will be less alienating), but I got quickly accustomed by it.The story is compelling and paced well, as was the case with the first season. Telltale got good in creating a world were danger can be around every corner and after a while you'll find yourself distrusting each character. Each of the personages has been carefully crafted and supported with some really credible voice acting.Graphic-wise they held true to the comic book style graphics and it works well in this game. It gives the game a more humble look and really allows you to focus on the story (and the increasingly difficult choices you'll have to make) instead of making you take the scenic route whilst rubbing its rendering-engine in your face.As for the rest of the game-play, well, it is rather limited. You'll have to move from A to B from time to time and once you reach your destination cut-scenes usually take over. The real strong point of this series lies in the choice-system. Some of the choices have no effect, others only some (such as being mentioned in a later conversation), and some choices can define who dies or who you end up with. Some of the choices are easy, others will really make you wondering afterwards whether you made the right one or not (usually the last one of each episode does this).As mentioned, it is weird to play Clem since the choices I personally would make are not really the choices that my season 1 Clem would make. It is difficult to explain, but somehow it felt more natural to play Lee then to play Clem.Quick-time events are also back, and extended with some directional buttons instead of only mashing Q and E. It is a nice addition, but being an European using an Azerty-keyboard I would have liked the possibility to change my keybindings. I died multiple times by hitting the wrong directional key during some fast-paced quick-time event due to having the wrong reflexes.In short: Amazing game, certainly worth every penny!"

Not that I like the game much more than I did half way through, but the interface issues didn't cause problems in the second half of the game. Unfortunately this was because there was almost no interactive elements in the last couple of episodes.For me,  Telltale games are only worth it when they are deeply discounted. I will sometimes buy a game at full price even though I know I won't play it for months, because I want to support the developer. Not the case for a Telltale game, I really don't care how well they do.Worse than Season 1, and that wasn't great.Almost no interactivity, and what little interactivity there is is extremely poorly done. The only places I got stuck for a while on were caused by interface issues. Searching the forum for the game made it clear that lots of people had the same issues I did but Telltale never bothers to fix things.I guess the game is somewhat worth it for the story at 75% off.

Just feel like writing a quick review because I miss this game so much, I especially miss having to wait a couple of month for a new release of an episode.Compared to last season, this game seems to have more cut scenes, and less player controls.  I don't really mind it all that much, because everything else like the story, characters, voice acting and graphics, are just as amazing as previous season.Everything about this game is just feel so perfectly done, and I don't really know what I like most about it.  But for this season, I have to say the character development was better.  Of course you'd have to play season 1 to fully appreciate and have a deeper connection with this season's young little girl protagonist.Just one little thing I dislike is the end of this season is more of a cliffhanger than previous season.  Season 1 seems to have better closure for the ending.Despite having backlogs of games on steam like many other steam users here, and never ending sales on steam and bundles; this is probably the only series I will gladly pay full price when season 3 comes out."

Played through it until the last episode, sure I was going to, but unable to stop because I wanted closure.  Then I got to the last episode, and about halfway through the series re-won my love.  This game doesn't live up to the original.  In fact I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who did not play the original.  But for those of us who did this game will be irresistable- in fact the best parts of this game are carried over from the original.  But those parts are enough.+Suceeds in generating ""feels"" for those who played the original.+They fixed problems with the control sceme, I was able to use the controller throughout the entirity and was not frustrated doing so.+Still can't run, but can kind of shuffle slightly faster.+UI much more clever, rewind feature better implemented.-Plot holes plot holes plot holes!  Some are big and we can hope will be filled in later in the series.  Actually the more unforgivable ones for me are the small ones.  This game makes even less pretense at being a point and click puzzler than the original, but when it feels like the items you need to complete a task are placed there just so that you can complete the task and don't really have any reason to be in the rooms they're in as far as the plot is concerned- well, it's just sad.-Signifigantly shorter than the original.-Maybe my sense of fatalism has increased, maybe this is just a darker game, but I never felt any real pressure to make the right decision.  People seem to forgive you no matter what because you are a child.  You are also always the one to do tasks and make decisions.  A big change from the original where people ask a lot for their trust and you are seldom if ever the leader.-New interactions sometimes over the top.  OK, pressing ""A"" rapidly again.  They did sometimes add to the immersion, but in particualr I never felt the ""hold 'A' and push in a direction"" added anything.  I also imagine much of the playtime lost from the original went to rendering death scenes where interactions were failed.=Overall I love the game series and what it's added to the genre.  I won't lie.  I'm going to keep buying these games pretty much no matter what.  But I hope Telltale moves back towards the slow, thoughtful, heartbreaking original and away from the fast, gimmicky, gore-festiness of the sequil.=Worth a buy at $9.99, but only if you've played the original."

I really liked the visual quality, sound effects, music of the 'game' as well.What it is not:It's not as interactive as one would expect (unless you played the first season).  It has it's own pace, which you don't have much influence on either.  It has dialog (and some action) choices that have some degree of consequence to the immediate future of the gameplay, but in the end it generally leads to the same place.  It is very linear, but TWD2 is engaging enough to mitigate the typical aggrivation with games that are too linear.Summary:Like most reviewers, I recommend TWD2.  Just know going in what it is, and is not.  My only complaint is the darn  credits.  I'm sure the team deserves cudos for such quality work, but they run for several minutes at the end of each 'Episode' and I couldn't figure out how to bounce out of them.  After four episodes of that plus the inline credits at the beginning of each episode, I couldn't help but feel like they were just bragging.  They certainly do deserve credit for an enjoyable, unique experience though <hats off>."

Episode five is not out yet but from the chapters we have avalible the story is a bit lacking and I honestly don't feel for any of the charcters as much as I did for Lee and the others in the first one. Clementine is a strong charcter but thats about the only one you end up caring for. I want to love this game I truly do.  But unfortunatly the chapters are shorter the story dosen't really make much sense as there is no goal for your charcters other than in episode two and three. The first episode is also slightly boring as almost nothing happens including talking to other characters. I enjoy this game but its no Walking Dead season one. I hope episode five is great as that is the only way my oppinon could differ."

Don't worry, they'll die later.Someone in your group left that you wanted to stay? Well, they leave no matter what you do or say, oh well.Your choices and actions change others actions and how they think of you? Not really, the end result is almost always the same.The choices you made in Season 1 will have a large impact on Season 2? that's funny.You've been waiting for a month for the next episode to come out?

Its a nice story gets a little sad, but then brings its self back round. I will say if you really want to enjoy this game wait for episode 2 to come out before buying it. I finished this game in about an hour and a half and I really don't feel satisifed. But if you are really into this series then just buy it. But if you're just learning about this series/game get the first one and then after episode 2 for this comes out get the game. That way your not just sitting there waiting like most of us now."

The ending is by far the best part (as it should be I suppose), and the characters sometimes have strange motives and make confusing choices. I'd still recommend, especially if it's on sale."

Seriously, I play all games in good guy mode, but I wanted to murder Kenny in cold blood nearly every second he was on screen — even when he wasn't being a temperamental, ineffectual know-it-all with really terrible ideas. I like these games overall and would recommend them to anyone interested in visual novel type games; however, if Kenny comes back for season three — if I even see one screen shot with that dude in it — I am quitting the series."
