,Recommended,261180,11915219,"Posted: 29 August, 2014",all,Cabby,"The online is incredibly good, which is to be expected from GGPO.  4 player games tend to lag/desync a bit, but as long as you are not playing across countries, it handles it well.  1v1 online is nearly perfect from my viewpoint.Controller support is also good, I have tested 4 different controllers, all of which worked.  Only a few required minimal key binding.Gameplay itself is of the ""simple to pick up, hard to master"" variety.  Great for local party/competitive play.  Its fast paced, and has a lot of ""epic moments"" for all your friends to hype about.Not much content to be honest, though the game is obviously about multiplayer, and they do have a few modifiers to change things up.  But this is an important note, if you don't have good internet/local friends, do not get this game.  Though I doubt anyone reading this falls under this category.I personally like the art style, I have heard a lot of people complain about graphics.  I don't really need to review this though, if it looks ugly in the screenshots, you will find it ugly in game.Boss soundtrack, as in GOOD electronic music, not try hard dubstep.If my review seems badly written, it is because I am not a writer.  But you can trust me on this, Lethal League is amazing for what it is, and is definitly worth the asking price.  Anyone who is shying away because it is ""too simple"", there is a lot of depth/mind games to be had in hitting a ball back and forth(as silly as that sounds).  Is it another Nidhogg?  No.  Another Divekick?  ehhh, maybe, depends on whether you hated Divekick for its gameplay or for other reasons.  To me, this seems like a similar concept to Divekick, though better polished, different gameplay mechanic that is more hype because of its faster/more deep nature, and a better presentation.  This game is definitly better than Divekick, but still holds the similar concept of simple but hard to master.In the end, yes, I do recommend this game.  This game will entertain you and your friends for a long time.If I have not answered your questions/concerns about this game, leave a comment and I will edit the review.""I am terrible at this game.10/10  Would noob rage again.""Edit: Nominated for The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award."
,Recommended,261180,32543323,Posted: 18 June,all,JediJoe0,"The game itself is very fun, but performance is a serious issue.Lethal League consists of hitting a ball back and forth in order to (hopefully) hit and kill your opponent. Now, it gets much more complex than just this, with parries, clashes, bunts, smashes, and even specials being thrown into the mix, but the basic premise is always the same; hit the ball. You can play with up to 4 people, online or on local, and that's where this game really shines. It's extremely fun to play with friends, due to the easy-to-learn nature of the game, and how hectic and intense the matches can be. If you have a few friends that are willing to play, you are going to have a great time. Even with only a single friend, this game can be a blast. Most people complain about the online multiplayer, as it can be pretty difficult to find a match, with wait times of 5+ minutes just to find one. Don't let this discourage you, however, because the weekends usually boost the playerbase and if you find a match with someone, they'll usually play with you 20 games in a row, so you don't have to go looking for another player again. Sometimes you'll get matched up with a really laggy player, but this is as simple as quitting out and looking for another match. It does happen, but when it does, it's not that big of a deal.The gameplay itself is very enjoyable, and I can see myself playing this for hundreds of hours. Contrary to what it looks like at first, every single character is unique and different. Even something as simple as the angles they hit the ball at or their hitbox size is different. Every single one of them is properly balanced, with none of them being ""the best."" The only thing that determines their worth is the person playing them. Any character can beat any character. One of the main turnoffs is the lack of characters, with there only being 6 total to play as (excluding doombox.) But unlike most games, I see this as a good thing. This is due to the fact that all the characters have completely different feels to them, and with only 6 to choose, it allows players to actually learn their moves and develop strategies for each. More than 10 characters would be terrible for this game, because then it would be impossible to memorize all of their moves. And, unlike most other fighting games, there really aren't any ""combos"" that can be abused over and over again. Any ball can be hit if you're smart enough to know where to stand, or you know how to counter it. There are a few advanced concepts, as I mentioned above, but once you learn those, it's just getting to learn the ball and develop better strategies. If you ever want to switch things up, they do have a few things you can change, including a points mode, different types of balls, and even the ability to turn off ball tagging (making it so you can kill yourself with your own ball,) but generally the default mode is fun enough to not need anything added to it, and it's the most commonly accepted mode online. One of my favorite things about this game is how fast you can get playing, instead of waiting. Within 30 seconds, you can start a match, and within 4 minutes you can be done with one. If you are strapped for time, this will have you covered. Conclusion; you will not get bored of this game if you care enough to learn how to play.The soundtrack is awesome. It sounds great and perfectly fits the exciting, fast paced action that usually occurs. It isn't just background music either; most of the tracks are pretty active, and can help build up the excitement. Unfortunately, there is only a very small selection of songs, with there only being one for each stage and then a few extras.The perfomance is the downfall of this game. Everything about this game is perfectly fine, but the performance is absolutely god-awful. It actually isn't a demanding game at all; all of the art is somewhat pixellated, and barely anything warrants lag in any way. If you're worried about your older machine not being able to handle it, don't. It will work. The issue lies in the online aspect of the game. The game experiences no perfomance drops when doing local games or bots, but everything else has severe issues. For one, the game can randomly lag in the middle of games that have pretty decent ping. This is unacceptable in a game that has such a focus on timing and precision. There is also a severe issue with games of more than 2 players. When you look online for match, it automatically pairs you up with one other person, so all online matches you play (that I've come across, at least) are 1v1's. Any lag in a 1v1 is usually the result of the other person, not the game. However, this is not the same with a 3 player or 4 player match. Since Lethal League uses P2P connections, any players that lag the game slow down everybody else. This means that one person can slow down the entire game. There is also a crippling bug as of 6/18/17 that still hasn't been fixed for almost 9 months. When playing 3 or 4 player matches, the game can disconnect and prevent the match from starting. After this happens, every single person that has disconnected has to reload the entire game all over again. If you don't, the disconnection will continue to happen until you reload. This happens roughly once every third match for my friends and I, and it completely ruins the game. Just to play around 10 matches you have to reload 3 times. I really don't know why this hasn't been patched yet.All in all, this game is pretty awesome. It requires a lot of skill, and it really stresses the importance of timing and precision. However, the frequent lag, crashes, and overall issues this game has can ruin the experience. If you have friends that are willing to buy it, or if you frequently play games on a local machine, I would definitely recommend it. A word of advice, though; wait for a sale. $14 is a lot for a game that only really consists of a small amount of content. So, yes, I would recommend this game to a friend."

You pick a character and hit an anti-gravity ball against your opponents to beat them, the ball speeds up and bounces harder off the walls with every hit it takes, reaching unbelievably fast speeds - particularly when one charges the hit. All this makes it hard to avoid the ball and also hard to hit the ball. Each player has a certain amount of lives per round and lose them by getting hit with the ball. Once all your lives run outyou’re done, and the round ends when there’s only one player left in the game.Pros:++++ The game is good fast-paced fun, the latency is very comfortable.+++ The audio and visual aspects are very befitting of each other, especially the effects and art style.+++ Music is awesome, fits perfectly with the battle atmosphere.++++ Hitting the ball feels solid, firm – making for immersive projectile battles.++ Different modes: FFA, TEAM DEATHMATCH+++ Different characters make for different moves/special moves.+++++ ”No weak♥♥♥♥♥♥”Bittersweet:-/+ Gameplay is easy to learn but hard to get good at, practice makes perfect and provides hours of fun.-/+ Speed cap for the ball is ridiculously high, might as well be infinite which makes for difficult but impressive moments.-/+ Limited player choice, however they are very stylish and have different colour schemes.-/+ Player base has cool people, but it’s not very big.Cons:-Not really anything negative about the game, if I had to name something it would be the lack of characters and small community.Final Opinion:All in all this game is addictive, exhilarating and a massive amount of fun. It’s as if Super Smash Bros, Pong, and whichever traditional 2D fighting game you can think of had a baby. Easy to pick up, hard to master. Art style, music and gameplay go perfectly well together for an amazing fighting experience."

Gets more and more intense as the round goes on and both parties are screaming their asses off as the balls pierces the fabric of the earthEXPLENATION: Its a fighting game where the player chooses their select character each with its own special ability that is more or less balanced. The object of the game is to hit a small ball back and forth, changing its colour to the player that touched it last, if a player who is not the same colour touches the ball (as in not hit it) they die and lose a life, zero lifes left and the player is eliminated. Now heres the kicker, as the ball gets hit more and more, it gains more and more speed, extreme amounts of speed one could say and the colours of the game starts changing to match the intensity and the speed that the ball is going at. All while a kickass soundtrack plays in the background. Definetly a fun game although I wish more people played online :("

76561197960510565,Recommended,261180,23002788,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,HitokiriR66Y,"Lethal League is a what you get when you cross a fighting game with dodgeball in all the best ways.  Players jockey to control a small ball, hitting it around the screen in an attempt to knock out eachother.  Every hit on the ball speeds it up, and it quickly moves from an easy to predict slow moving projectile to a streak that bounces around the screen, ricocheting off ceiling, walls, and floor to take out players.This simple set up leads to an exciting and incredibly fun game.  Unlike most fighting games, there are no long lists of special moves to learn and memorize (each character has slightly differnt angles they will hit the ball at, and a special move that can be powered up during play and used, but no difficult button combos are required for any moves).  This makes the game very intuitive and easy for players to jump in and start playing, even if you are not into fighters.  However, the interplay between player and their specials does lead to a suprising amount of depth in the combat, and learning the timing to intercept balls as they come off of other players at higher speeds will take practice.If I had any criticisms for the game, it would be that the simplicity of it can be a double edged sword.  Games can start feeling repetative during long play sessions.  Game options can extend this a bit, but in the end most feel gimicky and I find myself losing interest after 30-60 minutes.  However, that being said, I still find myself coming back to this game to get in a few quick rounds against friends when we don't have time for a long playsession, or to finish out a night of gaming.  And that is where the game shines imho, quick bursts of action and excitement when I don't have the time to spend hours playing.This games perfectly fills a niche in my gaming library.  It is well worth the price (and worth getting a few extra copies for your friends as well).  An unreserved thumbs up from me."

Being completely free of over complication, Team Reptile have fortunately channelled the most special elements of the nostalgic games of the golden era, where a sole focus on gameplay has driven design and development. The result being a game with no apparent story, not character progression, and no cheap ways of making you feel as though you should be playing the game, instead it slaps you in the face with a fresh take on Fighters, that is plain and simply, unsullied fun.The gameplay and structure of LL lends itself perfectly to the resolution of longstanding disagreements (1-on-1 Fights), bouts of personal worth and glory (4 way FFA), and also to bond-building exercises (2-on-2 Team Fights). The beautiful thing about the simple gameplay is it works so well not only in the hectic 4-way FFA, but also in 1-on-1 combat, where the simple mechanics eventually boil down to a game of whits, where you are more trying to force the other player/s to swing at the wrong point, or you are trying to think and act fast enough to catch them off-guard.That long winded jargon can be distilled down to; this game is perfect for playing with friends, and that is exactly how it should be consumed. This game has one of those qualities where if you get served too hard, you will hate it; so take it in with friends and you will instantly see the gratifying outcome of learning together, while also pulling off some badass manoeuvres resulting in you all squealing like manly Girl Scouts. We have not tried it in Online Play as my internet services would make the game run like an interactive slideshow. But we can safely say that by grabbing a few ales, a few controllers, and huddling around your PC, you will be parting in the finest display of competition I have seen in a video games since Mario Party 64.Team Reptile have not given this game a huge amount of content, with 5 characters and 6 Levels, BUT, the content in the game is so perfectly polished, I question whether the development team is really as small as they say. We would love to see more playable characters and levels in the future just to give the game that bit of spice, but where it stands now is a testament to where AAA game development falls short in modern game development; where such heavy focus on being the next money making machine makes games lose that…specialness.From a developer’s standpoint this game has soul, you can feel the love that went into it when you play it.

The ball will deal damage to your opponents after you hit it, but can be hit by them, which can then cause it to deal damage to you. As in pong, you keep rallying the ball back and forth, with it getting faster and faster until one of you is hit, at which point you lose a life and the ball resets.What sounds like a very simple concept rapidly becomes a hillarious series of ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥"" moments in which the ball is going so incredibly fast that you'd think it impossible to hit, but then someone does, and it gets even faster.Throw in a bunch of colourful and creative characters and stages, along with an incredible sound track, and some very fancy and flashy visual and sound effects that wouldn't feel out of place in an Anime or Manga, and you get an enjoyable and hillarious experience.Would reccomend playing with friends (up to 4 player) for added hillarity and fun."
,Recommended,261180,32331320,Posted: 10 June,all,Chrismas95,"On the surface, Lethal League might seem really simple. You just hit a ball until it goes so fast that your opponent gets hit by it and you win. While that’s the jist of it, there’s a lot more to it that makes it fun to play as you make plays (or other people make plays on you). The bunt is an ability that stops the ball dead no matter the speed and pops it up, giving you the opportunity to hit it. With its big hitbox, it’s how you’re gonna turn an enemy’s 2000 mph ball into YOUR 2000 mph ball if you can hit it. When you hit a fast ball, there’s a pause before the ball launches off again and your opponent can time it to hit the ball right as it “unpauses.” At the same time, you can flash a little shield that blocks their hit during the pause if you time it right. And finally, each character has their own special ability that messes with the movement of the ball and makes it less predicable, especially at higher speeds. With all of these little things in place, it makes a weird “Pong fighter” into a chaotic and fun game to play with friends.There’s one thing to watch out for. This game sometimes has connection issues, so you’ll probably need to pause every few games to remake a lobby because the netcode acted up."

REALLY fun. It's a complete blast to play due to it's frantic, fast paced action. The premise? There's a baseball. Hit it at your enemy. If it hits them, they die. If they hit it back - be ready. Every time be ball is hit, it picks up speed (especially if hit with a charged hit or an aerial downwards smash) and the ball can reach LUDICROUS speeds.I'd say if there's anything the devs did to PERFECTION, it's satisfying gameplay. Every impact in the game has that satisfying SENSE of impact. The faster the ball goes, the longer the ball will stay in freeze frames if you can hit it - building anticipation. The sound design is FANTASTIC for this. Along with this, You can also hit your enemies bodies as they fall of the screen - for great comedic effect. And they even go in the proper direction to the aim you hit them with - it's hilarious. The game as satisfying as f*** and it's what makes the game.The problems? First and foremost, online play is probably a waste of time. It's near dead and if you MANAGE to find a match, it's probably super high ping because the game couldn't find anyone close to you. Secondly, I personally feel the game is a little lacking in content. There are just six characters. There's been 6 since launch, and there will never be any more. That's all you're going to get. Sure, they're all unique in terms of the angles their hits send the ball, and their (sometimes) cool special abilities, but I feel more variety would make this game WORTH it's price. 14 dollars just seems too much to me. A general customer base would not get a whole lot of time out of this game. There are diehard fans, but they're not the majority. Unless you have friends to play with or get REALLY into the mechanics, this game has a short lifespan for you. Which is really unfortunate, as I think the game has a lot more potential. It's mechanics are perfect, but it just doesn't feel finished to me - like they could've added more, but didn't.In short, it's a phenominal game with a dead online playerbase and lacking in content, but amazing nonetheless. If you catch this game on sale, you can buy it, and maybe buy a 4pack for some friends. But don't ever buy if you haven't any friends interested in it, or can't bring it to a party or something. It has no singleplayer value. If you DO have friends who have/are interested in it, GET IT if it's ever on sale. It's a HUGE blast to play."

The hardest part of Legal League is when you travel to Somalia and try to convict various people of their horrible war crimes on behalf of the United Nations' Legal Department.

The longer you survive the more ridiculous it gets, to the point where I'm pretty sure I was hitting the ball at light speed. It was terrifying and hilarious. Especially since faster hits have weird visual effects on maps (like, on one map all the windows break, an eclipse happens, and rioting mobs appear.) that then vanish when the ball is no longer being hit. Its like youre ripping into an alternate dimension.I should mention that my first (and so far only) play session lasted two whole hours, but felt closer to 30 mins.So, overall, pretty damn great. I usually complain a lot in reviews (...on Amazon. I rarely do Steam reviews) but I don't even have any complaints about this.If you're unsure about buying it, just do. You won't regret it."

,Recommended,261180,17275423,"Posted: 28 July, 2015",all,Baphomet,"Lethal League is a competitive ""battle pong"" that has you take control of one of six players, each with different styles of play, in a deadly game of tag-by-baseball. The fundamentals of the game are pretty simple: Hit the ball and it changes to your color and will damage every enemy player but not yourself. Bunting will send the ball upward and give you a chance to reposition for a better attack. Any time you hit the ball you build up a super meter that will allow you to perform a special attack once filled.The majority of strategy in LL revolves around two things: hit meter/lag, and angles. You'll need to pay attention to the hit meter at the bottom of the screen to know how much longer it will be before the hit lag ends and the ball continues on in play. Knowing when it will re-enter play will allow you to position yourself accordingly and begin your counter attack. Another important factor is being aware of the angle the ball takes (or will take if you can predict it) since knowing that will allow you to take control of it with your own strike or avoid getting knocked out.Lethal League basically has two modes spread across several categories: Versus (Online/Local/Challenge) and Strikers. Versus is the basic game mode where you have a limited number of life stocks and the game ends when you or your team run out of them. Strikers puts you in position of a goal that you must keep the enemy team from hitting with an enemy-charged ball. There is also a point game in the challenge mode which is like versus but you play until one player gets a set number of kills.Since the game only has six playable characters, six stages, and really just two modes (only one of which seem to be played online: versus). You'll probably find yourself running out of things to do without having a bunch of friends to play with. Not to mention the online community is rather small and it can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes just to find a match, and when you do find a match, having any kind of lag between the players can make some rounds pretty difficult as the ball bounces and hit lag can become downright unpredictable. There are definitely some fun times to be had when you get matched up with a decent opponent, though.I would recommend grabbing this game somewhere around $5 or cheaper to really get your money's worth. It's not a bad game per-se, it just needs more content."

If you need a fastpaced, short but addicting game that's playable with 4 of your buds, or some strangers online, this is for you.Lethal League is comparable to a game of tennis or pong. Except totally insane and chaotic. And you aim to kill your opponent with the ball instead of passing them. While there's order in the chaos, nothing is more fun to get the ball speed up to insane heights and hope you survive.The game rules and controls are simple and to the point; hit the ball, bunt the ball and jump to avoid the ball, while trying to hit other characters with it. Each of the 5 characters has their own specific special abilities.There might be a learning curve when it comes to timing your shots and being able to track the ball the faster it goes, but with practice comes alot of fun, and when you master it, it gets EVEN BETTER. It's recommended to play with friends, locally or online, but randoms can be fun too if you find the right guy.GGPO, this game's online component, is a little more tighter than done with Street FIghter 3: Online edition, altho sometimes you notice people dying yet not, but the game is so fast you don't care anyway and adjust accordingly.If there's one slight I would give this game: Not too often, It can and will crash at a certain point, persumably one of the characters specials will hit the ball and might crash one of the players out of the game. It's a sad thing too, because other times it won't happen and gameplay flows fine. I'm expecting this to be fixed in an upcoming patch of some sort.All in all, an excellent fun and simple game that gets deeper the more you get into it, and a great way for a bunch of buds to spend some time smacking each other in the face with high velocity balls.Yeah.8.7/10"

This unique ""fighting"" game still has me on the edge of my seat, with intense high-speed battles.Lethal League plays a bit differently than other fighting games, since you have little effect on your opponent directly. Instead, to knock them out, you must hit a levitating ball and land a direct hit, while your opponent tries to do the same to you. Mind-games come into play as you can hit the ball under an angle up and down, which causes it to bounce rapidly around the stage!Other features: Sweet music and high moddability (Sprites, music, UI).While the GGPO connection actually works great (A high ping player will bring down any game, really) once the match has started, there are some issues when starting the match, occasionally locking up the game.

While it's at its best in multiplayer, this gem of a game will be able to keep any player enveloped for a good amount of time after they start playing. Playing as a sort of cross between Super Smash Brothers and Pong, Lethal League employs up to 4 player in a fight to the death where the only means of downing an opponent is to bat an anti-gravity baseball into them. The characters, while limited at the moment, are all a joy to control and all have interesting designs, my personal favorite of the bunch being Candyman. Lethal League really is a blast to play, and is my personal pick for Indie Game of the Year. If you ever pick it, chances are that you won't be putting it down for a very long while."

,Recommended,261180,11902796,"Posted: 28 August, 2014",all,The Good Sir Hatter,"I guess I'll start this review like everyone else started their own review:No weak♥♥♥♥♥♥Lethal League is a projectile fighting game that plays like nothing else I know of. To make immediate comparisons, it's like Smash Bros meets Pong meets Divekick, with a lot of emphasis on the Divekick part. The goal of the game is incredibly simple: hit the ball to gain control of it, try to smack it into everybody else. If someone else hits the ball, don't get hit and try to return the ball.This game is deceptively simple, and I say this because even though the mechanics are limited, the ways in which you use those mechanics are actually fairly deep. You have two main actions you can take, you can hit the ball or you can bunt the ball. When you hit the ball, you can either send it flying straight, or angle it up or down. Bunting the ball will slow it down to its lowest possible speed and pop it in the air, giving you time to place your next hit strategically. Every hit will cause the ball to gain more speed, making it harder to keep track of, dodge, and hit.But it turns out that there's WAY MORE STUFF YOU CAN DO THAN THAT. There are six ways of hitting the ball: on the ground, you can angle it up, down, or straight forward, in the air you can angle it up, forward, or spike it to the ground. Spiking the ball automatically doubles the speed, so you can cause the ball to get faster multiplicatively by spiking it over and over again. You can also bunt the ball up, forward, backward, or straight down, giving you options on where you place the ball. Hitting a ball at the same time as your opponent causes you guys to clash and bounce off each other. And with the five characters, each one has their own super move, swing speeds, swing arcs, and hitting angles. This game hits every fighting game requirement in respect to its depth, but at the same time it has that appeal that Divekick has of being super easy to pick up.The music is amazing in this game, all the tracks are taken from independent music creators, and it sets the entire tone of the game really well. Tracks are intense and fun, matching the frantic gameplay. The sound design isn't shabby either, as the ball increases in speed you hear sonic booms, the hit sounds are really nice and snappy, this game loves to bombard you with its really solid sound design.The art style is really great, too. Well drawn backgrounds that aren't too busy, but are still dynamic and change as the ball moves faster and faster. The characters are really interesting looking and are animated well, and your moves feel like they have weight behind them.As for the online, it works beautifully. Lag is completely unnoticable, when it works it works well. I did have occasional disconnection problems, but it was pretty negligable as me and my friends could jump back into the game really easily if anything went wrong and pick up with a fresh round.The only possible complaint you can levy against this game really is that the content is slightly lacking. With only five characters to choose from and six stages, it might leave you wishing for a little more to play with. But all in all, this game is an incredibly solid mechanical marvel that is great fun with friends. I give this a solid recommendation; there's no reason not to have this in your library."

In the most basic game, you hit a ball back and forth; if it hits you, you're out for the round. And it gains speed at every swing. So pretty simple, really. And hilarious. You can play local multiplayer or online multiplayer, and there's also a single player mode (""challenge mode"") which is a set amount of matches against set characters and combinations. The game modes are free-for-all (just hitting the ball until only one player remains), team play (works best for four players, obviously) and strikers (hit the other team's goal instead of its players).The problem with this game is that if you're playing alone, there really isn't much to do besides challenge mode - which, honestly, I didn't find it as fun as multiplayer. You can try to search for matches online, but most of the time it's just unfruitful, and the online mode has quite a few connectivity issues, especially if the match has more than two players. The game also gets repetitive quite fast, and while leveling up does unlock new things, they're mostly skins for the characters (there are 6 different in the game) which are purely cosmetic and honestly not that rewarding.Still, if you have a couple friends willing to engage in some pong-esque shenanigans, maybe over a skype call or even some pizza at your house, I can recommend getting a multi-pack of this game and bash away."

The introduction of a projectile in a fighter is absolute genius and works extremely well to my surprise.The goal basically is to hit a baseball around the screen and hope it hits your opponent but after playing a couple of games you are able to start predicting where the ball will go. Player modes include free for all, teams, pvp and multiple opponents. The more players you have the more crazy the game becomes, it’s great!!! I also found we were starting to use teamwork to work combos a lot more, which is a good thing.At the start of each game the player/s can choose a game type and also have the option to tweak ball speed, stock amounts, hit tag on and off and game time limit. I guess this is basicly a customizable hard difficulty but I never found myself using it. This is probably something for the more advanced hardcore players because you can max out the ball speed to hilariously stupid speeds. Try this straght away.The use of the different abilities and the build up of the little bar under your stocks, is extremely satisfying when you pull out a planned play, as if that ever happens. Even though each character has different abilities and some characters abilities are easier to play than others the game still seems balanced while playing. It’s like they have designed the characters based on players skill and it’s easy to see this especially with the layout of the character select when setting up a new game.The game is resolved when there is only one player left with stocks  or if a player has the most stocks at the end of the time limit. Though I found the time limit was unnecessary in most cases because the game usually ends far before the time is up.The games controls are simplistic in the way that there is only a couple of buttons to learn before you can start playing. The tutorial explains the basic controls and lets you practice them after they show you although the tutorial was forced at the first opening of the game, which actually wasn’t that bad as it was only quite short. There is also a practice mode available where all the try hards can spend all day to practice more difficult moves and combos, don't be that person.My favourite part of Lethal League would have to be the game soundtrack and artwork. The music works well with the hit lag as well as the different stage artworks. This is one of the first things I look at when playing a game. Once it hit the starting screen when I first opened it and the music started with the announcer and his thundering voice saying “Lethal League!!” I knew this was going to be one of those games. Both the art style and the soundtrack to me give a 90’s american hip hop feel with some of the environments reflecting this. Yo! Like boom boxes and♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game gives that persistent feeling like all the individual components of the game gel together."

So I waited for a good sale, bought it, and just had a blast. When I first saw this game, I thought it was your average fighting game that you could land all the sweet combos with friends. But Lethal League is so much more than just a fighting game. With the only way to blast fighters out of the arena using a ball that is consitantly gaining speed, bouncing, flying, and who knows what in any direction, this game adds an intense factor in trying to stay alive.I remember when I had three friends over and we all had out own wired controllers, so I suggested we played Lethal League. I had already been playing a lot of it, and they had never played in their life. Now, when I thought playing alone was fun, I never accounted having friends to play with. But when more people joined the game, it becomes hilariously joyous, with a lot of tense moments of only two people left and the ball being at over 1000 speed, some people figuring out new attacks, or people getting that three-hit wipeout, mostly on accident.All in all, Lethal League is a sweat-inducing and creative game, bringing a fresh idea to the fighting game genre, and one that works incredibly well.

I saw videos of people playing it on youtube and loved what i saw. got in and realized... the game is hard, still fun, but hard. the ball goes up to high speeds quicklyso an average game is around 3-4 minutes at 8 lives starting at the default speed. there are a surpriding amount of strategies you can come up with after you figure out the nuances of the characters. my personal favorite is the fact that if you aim up with Switch (the robot skateboarder) the ball goes up and behind you, the hammer girl (Sonata) can change the ball direction with her special, my girlfriend even enjoys playing the aligator (Latch) because she can play ""Walligator"" by clinging to a wall and swinging until she can grab the ball and shoot it at me point blank.all in all it's a good gamesolid sound tracka ""challenge"" mode that reminds me of super smash bros classic 1P mode.art style isnt much at first but it grows on youminor connection issues in online multiplayerlocal multiplayer as well as onlineeasy to learn hard to master i would say (a lot of little details that make you better, but arent needed for casual play)-basics- swing (hit ball, ups speed by 1) [aimable]- bunt (knock ball up next to hit it gets bonus special meter) [aimable]- once bunted the ball will move at a low speed but resume previous speed when hit by a player or hitting the ground- parry (hit bunt during a hit to drain your special and knock back nearby players) [must be trying to hit the ball]- slam (downward air swing that doubles the speed of the ball)specials and traits-candyman- ball will teleport to the wall opposite the next wall it collides with keeping speed and direction, refreshed if CM hits it again- candyman has no heavy falling- candyman has the sharpest slam angle- sonata- special hits the ball 3 times after release, can reaim the ball at these points- has a double jump- latch- can climb walls- largest hitbox- special eats the ball, carries it, and releases at speed it was caught- switch- can scate on walls and cieling (limited time)- upward aim goes behind him- special is activated as a doublejump, if the ball hits switch during his kickflip the ball is hit by switch (counter)- Raptor- smallest hitbox- can bunt if ball is above him- fastest hit- special hits the ball twice and can change the direction of the ball on release"

Not much when playing alone, but with friends it is TERRIFYING FUN!Lethal League is a game that sets the line between babies and men. A game of Russian Roulette where you and your competitor hit an antigravity ball back and forth at increasing speed until somebody gets wrecked and dies! I say this is the line of boys and men because I have had many a time where I've been cowering in fear, PRAYING that God will take the ball and protect his child from it.

The main idea is you and up to 3 other players hit a small ball that seems to lack gravity or air resistance inbetween each other. When you hit the ball it get's 'tagged' with your color, and if someone gets hit with the ball when it's not tagged their color they're out.There's a lot more to it than that, like stage sizes and hit angles, but if you want a fun little game you ca jump into whenever and mess around with friends, or compete in actual tournaments, this game is for you.It's also a very chaotic game, however. At times you and someone else will end up getting one of you out, then thinking 'What the hell just happened?' And usually it can be a bit jarrring, especially at higher ball speeds when the screen starts shaking and you have to factor in hit lag.Overall, I give this game a 10/10. Really.

There are not O.P. characters or energy blasts just a ball that is going light speed and is about to shatter your skull along with any reservations you held towards this game.

That description is spot. Lethal League is a ton of fun though. Once you got used to how the game works the ridiculous amount of things that can happen are endless. The game offers three different game modes; free for all, team, and strikers. Free for all is exactually what you would expect up to for people all trying to knock eachother out by hitting the ball. Team is the same way other than being able to work with your teammate to control the pace of the game. Stirikers is basically soccer where each team is trying to hit the ball into the other teams goal while also trying to protect your own. For free for all I would reccomend three people because with four people the game gets to hectic for me personally. Also the soundtrack in this game is sweet! Overall though I would highly recommend this game to anyone as long as you have friends to play with. I would give this game a solid 8/10 with the only thing holding it back being the replay value since it relies so much on one type of gameplay some people may get bored fairly quickly."

The ball picks up speed. BIG TIME.There are 5 characters, and each have their own special abilities and characteristics.Some can cling to walls, Double jump, Skate along the ceiling, Wall jump, etc.They also have a special meter that builds up after 4 sucessful hits, allowing yourcharacter of choice to unleash their own unique special move.The animation is fluid and the environments are well done,and each stage comes with a pretty sick sound track.But back to the speed. The game picks up insanely quickly, and you can easilylose focus and get frustrated amidst all the chaos.

My one suggestion to the developer is to add some custom features (like changing the default ball speed or the gravity) and some other modes would be cool (tag team matches or something)Probably one of the best examples of a good indie game. The soundtrack is mind meltingly good, the thick electro and trance providing the perfect backdrop for a flawless game. The controls feel good. The sound design has that great new retro feel - evoking sweet sweet tones of Jet Set Radio. Rarely has the word eargasm been so applicable.

I can play with my friends even when the family is destroying my internet connection with streams and netflix.It's Pong, but you control a character and smash the ball against your opponent, until the ball goes so fast it breaks the universe and one of you takes it to the face. Not only that, but Lethal League has a 4 player feature, making it even more chaotic. Packed with a Artstyle that will probably remind you of Jet Set Radio, it also has one of the best soundtracks out there.It's 10/10 on anyone's list, I'm sure.What are you waiting for? go buy it and play with your friends!

This is the first exception I have found.Lethal league involves hitting a ball into other players. The ball gradually speeds up until it gets to insane high speeds. Unlike most arcade fighter games movement in incredibly important and memorising combos is unnecessary.You have three skills, hitting the ball, bunting the ball (which stops the balls movement, and a special attack cast by double hitting the hit button after scoring four previous hits on the ball. Each character has a different special attack.Lethal league is graphically and musically stylish and appealing as well as insanely fun.Subscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/Check out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM"

76561198080531709,Recommended,261180,11979413,"Posted: 4 September, 2014",all,Devinity,"To start off. This game is defenitly different than your average 2D fighter. With a very simular aspect of a Super Smash Bros. game, It's A four-player game with a objective that's not beating up another player until their health gauge is gone. Instead your hitting a ball at intense velocities slowly creeping up in momentum until one of the players hits it back faster or is knocked out by the ball. This is where it gets insane. Each character, despite its low roster, has special abilities to either make the ball move faster or cause insane mix-ups on the other players. They all have simular properties to SSB characters: like fast falling, Dash Dancing, and floaties. The big thing that you need to learn in this game is not really the technical prowess, but learning the frames of the game, predicting where the balls is going to go, and timing every hit correctly.Aside from all this jibber jabber, this game offers minimal stuff to do aside from leveling up, unlocking skins, and comepleting a offline challange mode simular to a arcade mode of somesort. The online takes a while to  find any kind of matches including 1 on 1 or a free for all battle but I have yet to run into a  match where it's just miseriably laggy.If you want a hype, over the top, different 2d fighter game; play this, enjoy it with your friends or go online and smash some scrubs. I'd definintly recommend this game."

Maybe even THE most intense. This game makes it so the ball goes really fast. And I mean FAST. The maximum speed a ball can get to is 10,000. That is ridiculous. The characters are all very enjoyable too. The aim is to get the most points or be the last one standing. When you hit someone with the ball, they go flying across the screen and off it. The characters play pretty much the same, but with different special moves. Raptor's baseball bat can send the ball going straight forward, Switch's kick flip can make the ball move weirdly and confuse players, Candyman can confuse the player by sending the ball across the screen and looping to the other side of it, Sonata's bass drop can give the ball extra speed, Latch can eat the ball and spit it out whenever he wants, and Dice's curve shot can send the ball flying in weird angles. If the ball gets enough speed, the stage can noticeably change. That's kind of a tough to notice detail, but it's cool.Overall it's a crazy dodgeball fighting game. The ball goes everywhere, crazy attacks can be performed, and people go flying off the screen. That's why my final rating for this game is a Super Smash Bros. out of 10.

Here's my pros and cons list if you don't want to read the rest of my review.Pros:Fast-paced high-intensity gameplay that only increases in speed and intensity as the match goes onBeginner-friendly with an optional tutorial that can be replayed as many times as needed, as well as a practice mode6 characters to choose from with unlockable character colors the more you playOnline and local multiplayer supports up to 4 playersFree-for-all and Team Battle game modesSingle player campaign mode available (and achievements for beating it with each character)Gameplay is fluent and customizable with either keyboard or controller, controlled with 3 buttons outside the four directional movement buttonsAmazing Soundtrack (at least, I think so)Cons:Lethal League online translates to Lethal Lag; I'd recommend not playing online if you and your friends do not have a fast and reliable internet connectionNot much variety in terms of content; the single player campaign is just a series of battles against CPU opponents.Depending on your musical tastes, you might not like the soundtrack. This can always be remedied by adjusting the in-game volume settings and playing your own music over the game.The long version of the reviewIf I was to describe Lethal League in one sentence, it would be Baseball Combat. You play as one of 6 characters, each with a different ability, and you hit the ball back and forth until it hits someone. When you get hit by the ball, you lose a life; when you lose all your lives, you've lost the match. I should note that hitting other characters directly does absolutely nothing, so you have to focus on hitting the ball such that it collides with your opponent.Up to 4 players can play at once, and the game modes include a free-for-all deathmatch as well as a team battle mode which supports both 2vs2, 1vs2 and 1vs3 modes. Friendly fire is optional (referred in-game as ball tagging) to allow a more intense experience should you choose to play with it.This game is very keyboard friendly if you don't have a controller (as I don't have a very good controller); controlled with the directional arrow keys for movement and the Z, X and Spacebar for other movements, you can re-map all the controls as you see fit in the options menu. My friend can confirm that this game plays great with a controller as well.Where I think this game shines brightest is its multiplayer, especially when playing with friends. With friends, regardless of how much I was winning or losing, not a moment went by where we weren't having the time of our lives. This game is very easy to learn as the controls are limited to movement, jumping, hitting the ball and bunting the ball (hitting it lightly), and the optional replayable in-game tutorial explains things sufficiently.Overall, this game is best played with friends, but can be played just as well solo. Definitely recommended, especially if it's on sale."

,Recommended,261180,35252236,Posted: 27 September,all,Wow.,"TL;DR : buy this game if you have friendships you need ruined.It is a crying shame the online community is dead. This game deserves better... hopefully the sequel will be more widely populated. Almost super smash bros, almost pong, this game is an incredibly unique approach to couch competitive games. The basic controls and simple design makes it easy for anyone to pick up a controller and understand what is going on. That being said, most of the time, you and your friends have NO IDEA what is going on unless you have played for countless hours. That confusion  creates the kind of lighthearted antics you would get from a game like smash. Even though it is easy to understand, that does not mean it is shallow in depth. There are rather advanced things you can do with angles, and hit lag, specials, and parries. This game can get rather intense.Lethal League is one of my absolute favorite games, despite my low game time, mainly due to having nobody to play against besides AI. I look forward to the sequel and having people to play against!(btw Ben, you know who you are, if you are reading this, when we settle our score you will get destroyed and I will be the champion gamer.

,Recommended,261180,24548706,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,Exist,"Like a good sequel should,Call of Duty: GhostsLethal League doesn’t ignore the formula of fast, fluid gameplay that has made the series famous, but introduces a unique new premise, unprecedented player personalization, and sweeping changes that breathe new life into the multiplayer experience. It’s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value.Despite sharing a name with one ofModern Warfare’sLethal League best-known characters, Ghosts takes place in an entirely new Call of Duty universe set in the not-too-distant future. In a genre overwrought with antiquated Russian conflicts and ambiguous Middle Eastern terrorist threats, Ghosts takes on a refreshingly unique premise in which the threat comes not from the east, but the south: a federation of oil-rich South American nations rises to take over the hemisphere, pushing north and coming to blows with the U.S.The prelude establishes a harrowing vision of a United States homeland that's broken but not beaten – not quite Red Dawn, but not Fallout 3, either. It’s a space not often explored by modern shooters, and its mood is heightened by missions set in a besieged Santa Monica and the wasted remains of San Diego, to the tune of an excellent, somber score from David Buckley (The Town, Metal Gear Solid 4). But ultimately, time on the poignant homefront is short lived as the story goes behind enemy lines in Caracas, the Andes mountains, and other exotic locales.Those might lack to familiarity, but the variety of environments keeps the campaign fresh, not only in terms of visuals, but in gameplay as well. Instead of just fighting waves of enemies through a linear stage at ground level, you’ll find yourself rappelling down skyscrapers, flying helicopters, having firefights in space, commanding tanks, scuba diving through shipwrecks, playing as a dog, and evading shark attacks. Each requires new strategy, acute situational awareness, and – in the case of the space and water missions – special consideration for verticality and physics.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Call of Duty game without elaborate setpieces, fierce shootouts, and tense stealth missions, and Ghosts delivers some of the most memorable experiences in the series. I felt genuine dread as the ground and buildings collapsed around me during orbital weapons strikes, the zero-gravity spectacle of the Federation’s space station ambush is awe-inspiring, and bursting through a highrise window as the entire building crumbles during the Federation Day mission is exhilarating.But like previous CoDs, the story of Ghosts struggles to remain in focus amidst the fray of explosive cinematic moments and relentless firefights. Narrated loading sequences with stylized story animations push the campaign forward, but only last for one or two minutes before launching back into the action. It’s there, on the front lines, that much of the plot progression is presented and oftentimes lost.It's by no means an achievement in dramatic storytelling — it's more about dumb fun — and it lacks the player-choice element introduced with Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but when given time to breathe Ghosts actually offers some interesting human drama. The story centers around two brothers, Logan and Hesh, their father Elias, and yes, their dog Reilly as they fight the Federation as part of the battered remnants of the U.S. military, and later as the elite Ghosts squad. The family ties, specifically the relationship between Logan and Hesh, made me care about the protagonists in a series that's habitually made its characters a dispensable commodity. The voice acting is decent overall, though there are periodic moments of cringe-worthy dialog, like one superfluous moment when Elias reveals he’s a member of the Ghosts. And then there’s Riley. Though the subject of many a meme at this point, Riley not only acts as a useful tool for recon and silently dispatching enemies, but is integral to several dramatic sequences, saving your character on more than one occasion.The story stumbles in the second act when it strays away from the more evocative character focus in favor of a long stretch of back-to-back missions driven almost exclusively by guns-blazing combat. While not poorly done, this visually arresting, action-packed, but ultimately hollow middle stands in stark contrast to the effective first and final acts. On the bright side, that padded out my play time to roughly 10 hours, making this campaign one of the longest CoD single-player experiences.The VerdictCall of Duty: GhostsLethal League isn't a reinvention of the franchise, but proves there's still room for innovation within its existing formula. Though at the risk of overcomplicating things at times, its robust multiplayer gameplay, surprisingly fun co-op modes, and lengthy, challenging, and varied campaign makesGhostsLethal League one of the best Call of Duty games to date."

A discthrowing 1v1 pong-like game in a form of a fightinggame with different specialmoves and characters.This game on the other hand takes those Ideas and give them a new look and feel and resembles one of the most unique games of this decade.#### What are we doing exactly? #####The goal of the game is getting a ball to hit your opponents. You can hit the ball in many directions and the ball is bouncing of the walls. There are different attacks and specials you can do to speed up the ball or causing it to change directions.####### Gameplay ######Smooth as butter. Easy to learn, hard to master. You can get relatively far with just playing with feel and a little bit random button presses. But if you learn how to combo, parry and reducing your hitlag, you can get constant wins.####### Graphics #######The graphics are completely 2D. It looks like it was done by MS Paint, but it has its own funky style. The graphics are snappy and look good. Especially the effects when you hit the ball as it reaches the speeds of  max 1000000pixel/s (I think thats the speedindex)####### Balance ########The game seems to be well balanced. Every character is different and has a specialattack and peculiarities like walljump, doublejump, wallclinging and driving across the ceiling with a skateboard. Also the angles, in which the ball flies after a hit, are different aswell. Because it is more about how you handle the ball, i don't think there will be overpowered characters.####### Network ########The netcode is powered by ggpo. You can feel how good the netcode is.. even with 4 players it's smooth as hell. There are some hickups, witch result in disconnects, but considering the age of the game, I wouldn't be surprised if the game got some updates to fix this. After all it's just a little annoyance, which is forgotten after you desperately try to reconnect to the massive fun. (which is fast anyway)###### Conclusion ######The game is a must-have. The fun we had in just 6 hours was tremendous. The game is best played with 4 players, in a 2v2 teammatch."

Sadly these are the three things that is keeping me from liking this game. The game feels great, I really do like the Smash Bros Melee feel they're going for, the graphics makes it look like it belongs on Dreamcast which is very nice, but unless if you have other people to play with it just doesn't feel like it's worth buying, especially with the full $14 it's asking for. In fact if you ask me this game feels more like it's more worth $4-$5 dollars with how simple it is, luckily that's how much I got it for thanks to the Steam Summer Sale. Perhaps if they had more stuff to do like in Smash Bros like having there own take on ""Break the targets"" or maybe something like pong where both opponents have to knock the ball into the other's territory or whatever it could amp up the value to 14 bucks in my opinion.Now this doesn't make it necessarily a bad game, but at the same time with these issues that I find like having nobody to play with, I just can't reccommend it."

,Recommended,261180,32557649,Posted: 18 June,all,mio,"I hate Lethal League. I immediately lose respect for anyone who plays it, and especially those who praise it. Here's why:Name 20 successful people that play it. League of Legends basically runs the show when it comes to games. This includes gamers like Kanye West, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Zayn Malik, Adele, Katy Perry, Beyonce et al. LOL has gamers making significant contributions to the entire gaming industry.Lethal League on the other hand pulls most of the heavy weight packaging from teenage angst with each match. They it lays basic mechanics and a joke of a metagame over it. It generally lags behind LOL by a mile or two in inventiveness. I never see this game at tournaments or mentioned by anyone over the age of 25.So tell me again, how exactly does Lethal League innovate? It even struggles to release fresh plays with each match, and artwork is about the only original thing with Lethal League.Yes, Lethal league is stable because it is standing on the shoulders of socially awkward teenagers. Most of the hard work is hashed out before they ever start playing ""games"". This is fine, and what games are all about, but I prefer to be in with the leaders rather than the followers.What really irks me and what has really brewed my hatred are Lethal League players. They seem to think Lethal League is responsible for all that is good in the vidya world. I have just proven how false this is. In my experience, Lethal League players (virgins, teenagers, and manchildren) are much less helpful than the alternative.If you want nice community, play LOL or DOTA. If you like fighting, Divekick. If you prefer, Shaq Fu or Clash of the Monsters. But please, don't feed the idiot magnet that is Lethal League!"

This is a great game to play when Bored or when you want to Goof off with friends. The small amount of playable characters Isnt so bad, Considering they all have differences between them. Over all I would say that this game is worth the buy, Although you might want to wait for the summer sale and get a 4 pack for you and your friends."

The artwork and character models are refined, and playing online is almost without issue. They even feature settings to make up for lag caused by excessive ping.Gameplay is unique, the goal of the game is to hit a ball at your opponent(s). It's all about timing, and while there are a few game modes to experiment with you will find consistency like with what you found in Smash Bros years ago: final destination, no items.Moving forward the developers have keen interest on promoting tournaments for the game such as with Jawbreakers 2015.

76561198072299466,Recommended,261180,15989791,"Posted: 24 May, 2015",all,Dr Wang,"Lethal league's core gameplay loop is the some of the most fun I've had since I started playing games on PC. It's a very basic game about hitting an anti-gravity ball at opposing players to kill them. Each round involves up to 4 players in a 2d arena hitting a ball at each other until only one player is left standing. The ball's speed increases with every hit so the game can become particularly intense when you and your opponents are all frantically trying to hit a ball that is travelling so fast that it appears to be in 6 places at once. Being hit by the ball after it has been hit by another player (not in your possession) means instant death; so reaction times and skillful plays are key.The matches last around 10 rounds and can take place in a variety of different arenas each with it's own theme and great soundtrack.There are 6 different characters to play as and each of them feels very distinct in playstyle due to each having different hit animations, mobility options and a unique special ability that can change the tide of battle in an instant.I won't lie to you, this game is extremely repetitive, but if you find the core gameplay principle of hitting a ball at ridiculous speeds into another player's face extremely satisfying like I do, then you will be able to put a respectable amount of hours into this game; especially if you bring freinds along for the ride. as such I would definitely recommend this game at its current price."

Add quirky characters and you're all set. Lethal League is one of those games that's difficult to describe. Though there have probably been similar games before it, this one does enough new things that make it unique.  You start out in an arena hitting a ball around. If you hit the ball, it turns your color. When you hit an opponent with the ball, they die. Last one standing wins. Last won standing after ten lives is declared the winner of the match.  To win, the game requires you to have cat like quickness. Each hit that the ball takes from a player it speeds up. The more players hit it, the faster it will go. Matches are usually five minutes at the most, so this game is great to kill a few spare minutes if you have a busy schedule. I would highly recommend this game to those who want to try a unique take on some well-known game mechanics. The game is fast, competitive and hell of a lot of fun.8/10"

You smack a ball at each other and whoever gets hit with said ball is knocked out; you usually have several stocks to lose before losing the game.Just the first 2 senteces should provide an accurate look on how original and interesting this game is. Lethal League is possibly one of the best video games I've played in 2015, and it's a shame to know I could've picked it up last year. It provides an easy premise with simple controls that allow the newest of PC gamers to enjoy the game, but it also gives space for more dedicated players to learn the game and play on a new level of skill. Similar to Super Smash Bros. in the sense that there's room for casual play but also room for intense combat. There's never a shred of time when I feel like the game is bad or boring. There's a multiplayer function that works well allowing you to host a room or join quick matches with others. There's also a single-player tutorial and challenge mode (similar to Classic mode for Smash Bros.)The Soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in some time and provides a meld of hip-hop beats and electronic funk to heighten the intensity of battles between others.This is such a great game, I feel like it'd be an insult to name it an indie game and put it on the same level as mediocre games like Fez and Five Nights at Freddy's.If there's any negative comment to make on the game, it'd be that I want more of it, and it isn't here yet."

Lethal League is a somewhat simplistic fighting game of the same nature as DiveKick, where you have to own the ball to own the court. Don't let this fool you, however: Each of the 6 characters has their own unique jumping style, angle of attack, and powerful special move to unleash at just the right moment. For instance, Latch can grab the ball in his mouth and fire it back out at another angle; Raptor slams it twice in quick succession; Candyman (who just wants to watch the world burn) lets loose a menacing jawbreaker that goes through walls, the ceiling, and even the floor to wrap around the other side of the pitch. Rounds are fast and frenetic, with the ball bouncing faster and faster with every hit, which means there's very little time to stay mad at whatever killed you last. GGPO support means you can play with people from across the globe without worrying about severe lag.What is this game worth? Probably about $10."

Similar to the indoor sport, the object is to hit a ball as fast as you can so it will rebound towards your opponent, the only difference being that you are TRYING to hit them. It's the first fighting game I know of where player contact is actually very discouraged. The ball will gain speed with each hit, and with each character boasting their own unique 'special' moves, the game can get extremely tense very quickly.If you like fighting games, this translates very easily, and becomes basically hardcore tennis, where the object is to get the other player 'out' by hitting them with the ball. As you can imagine, with more speed, this becomes trickier, as the frame window where you can hit the ball is VERY small and requires a keen sense of timing. Very fun, very easy to get used to, and allowing up to four players at a time, which is very rare in the world of fighting games."

You can charge up each shot by holding down the Z key (default key). You can play in either online mode or against bots, if you choose to face the bots you can increase their levels of difficulty.

A fighting game in spirit, Lethal League pits you and 1-3 more players in an arena with a ball. A single, deadly ball. The objective is quite simple, hit the ball and cause it to strike your foes, killing them instantly. The controls, much like the concept are simple with only three main functions: swing, bunt and jump, with directional modifiers included for swings. You've got several modes at your disposal, with the default mode being Free for All Stock matches, wherein it's every man for himself trying to eliminate the competition until they are the only one with any stocks remaining (this one is my personal favorite). Other modes include Teams (self-explanatory) and Strikers, where you're invincible and have to hit the opposing team's goal with the ball to score. Finally, this game has awesome netcode and is extremely playable even with ~110 ping, so even people as remote as myself can enjoy it.

And don't be fooled by my hours, I'm quite sure there are many more to come.TL:DR? Then just buy it.If you want to know though, Leath league is...Super Smash... On PC... with Pixel Art... With a ball... Wait what?! Yea, you can't attack each other. And there's a ball, and you only have 2 attacks, one to hit the ball and one to throw it up.So... why is this even good?The Ball speeds up when you hit it, and even more if you throw it up then hit it. And the most important thing is... if you get hit by the ball and your opponent was the one to hit it last, you're out. No hp bar, just out.Soon you realize you get into some intense Sudden death action, when the ball is flying around on the screen at 50 speed and you're a one shot out. But if you hit the ball and it goes fast enough that the enemy dosen't have enough time to stop it,  they're out. You start to go crazy waiting for the inevitable out of yourself or the other player, nobody ever has a sure chance of winning. You even start to scream and squel every time you die or kill the enemy.All in all, epic game. Buy it if you like crazy intense action. If not, buy it anyway."

So use caution...-PONG: Ball Physics,At first this game seems pretty simple, dodge the ball and hit it to the oponent, and that is pretty much it really...Newcomers to the game will get hit by some slow moving balls, trying to see the ball coming towards them. The fact is, that the ball will reach incredible speeds, making it litterally impossible to see coming. However it is not impossible to predict. The fighting term ""yomi"" is a perfect word to describe this game, ""yomi"" meaning predicting your opponent's actions.Although this game doesn't make it totaly impossible, there is a bar at the bottom of the screen that will fill up during a hit, sometimes quick, sometimes slow. Once it fills the ball will fly out. many players abuse this to hit the ball in the same place, I assume programmers saw this so they created a shield you can activate for a brief period at the cost of your meter, from 1/4 to full. If the other player hit's this, he will be stunned and sent towards the projectile, most of the time...This game has tons of replayability, I really recomend it."

There's 6 characters, a secret 7th character serving as the final boss of challenge mode, all of them with balanced movesets and the like.RAPTOR: 15 year old baseball dude. He doesn't jump too high, but he has a smaller hitbox and can wall-jump. His special allows him to hit the ball two times in a row, completely remove or even add hit-lag (hit-lag is a mechanic where when someone hits the ball, the game pauses while the shot is being ""charged up""), and change the direction of the ball to wherever he wants.SWITCH: Robot skater dude. He can skate across the walls, leading to some interesting shenanigans. His special is confusing, as you need to perform it by pressing the jump button in the air, not while hitting the ball. It allows him to remove all hit lag, and it will automatically direct the ball to the bottom-right of the screen.CANDYMAN: Mutated insane dude. He has no special ability related to movement, although, he has the highest base jump of any player (he is able to reach the ceiling of all maps with a single jump). His special allows the ball to pass through walls, useful for tricking the enemy.SONATA: Chick with a giant beatbox hammer. She can double jump, but each jump is much shorter than normal. Her special allows her to ""hit"" the ball as it's traveling, changing the trajectory of the ball as it goes. Very useful in ""Strikers"" mode.LATCH: Robot alligator dude. He can climb on the walls, and hit the ball while on the walls (balls to the wall!). His special makes him eat the ball, and spit it back out in a different direction. You can also ""bunt"" the ball out of your mouth by pressing the bunt button while executing the special move.DICE: Monk with a ping-pong paddle. He has an extremely short jump, but if you crouch and then jump while crouching, your jump height can rival Candyman. His special allows him to telepathically move the ball in a different direction, and it will continue to worm it's way across the field until the ball hits a corner, at which point it will spasmatically bounce across the stage.SPOILERS!DOOMBOX: A giant boombox demon. Serving as the final boss of challenge mode, he has a much larger health pool than the previous challengers, but has a much larger hitbox to compensate. His special allows him to double the speed of the ball while he's hitting it, and change it's trajectory to almost any direction. Hitting the ball will also fill double the normal amount of the charge bar (meaning instead of 1 bar, it fills 2). Unlike other characters, when he gets hit, he doesn't fall off stage, and instead gets angrier and angrier until you hit him one final time.Go play this game. Now. Stop reading.

Lethal League brings a new and engaging twist to the idea: Instead of hitting each other with your fists, you hit a ball at them, and they can hit it back. It turns into a game of timing and skill, rather than just button mashing. A relatively easy concept to learn, but beyond that, there are plenty of ways you can go about out-balling your opponent. Very cool, and very fun."

I am very glad that I did.  It is a projectile-based fighting game where you attempt to smash a ball into your opponent while also avoiding getting hit, kind of like dodgeball on super steroids.  Very fun to play with friends or online.  The online multiplayer is one of the best I've seen.  It runs very smoothly, minus a few hiccups here and there (95% of the timee only happening during a 4-player match).Each of the characters and stages feel balanced, that is no one seems overly powerful. Every character has a special ability they can use after filling their gauge as well has having unique properties, (Sonata has a double-jump, Latch can cling to walls and strike from wall-cling, ect).  Each character has their own playstyle and most will find one they like over others.The only real flaw I've seen so far is that the single player/challenge mode is a little boring, but oh well.  Online is more fun anyways.Overall I would strongly recommend this game.  It has great gameplay, very fun multiplayer, interesting characters and stages, and a good soundtrack."

Really addictive, fast paced pong-like fighting game, as everyone has said. Very nice art direction and killer soundtrack. Like Super Hexagon-good soundtrack. You get 6 lives and each time you hit the ball, it turns your color and gains speed. If the ball hits one of your opponents while it is your color, they die. Once all of your opponents are out, the match resets, until only one player is left. The character roster is small (6 right now) and I hope they add a bunch more. Up to 4 person free-for-all with one on one options as well. It reminds me of Smash in a way even though its completely different, in that you are constantly timing and lining up juggling, since that's what the entire game revolves around; juggling the ball to gain speed and take your opponents out.9/10"

It's a projectile fighter, so your aim is to hit the opponent with a projectile (in this case, a ball). Simple, right? Well, you have different ways to hit the ball, directions you can aim it, and specials specific to your character that make each matchup intense. Games can be over in a second once the ball starts moving fast, or even in the first ten seconds if you play right or predict your opponents' moves. There's immense satisfaction in each return, and the game really excites you with the euphoria of good returns mixed with the  rush and fear if your opponent somehow still returns the ball that you just shot at him at 10000 mph. It's sort of similar to in the projectile match between Link and Ganon in the Legend of Zelda, except you die if you screw up once. There's a few game modes that you can switch between, and there are some options to tweak your matches. The options are a little limited, but honestly, the game is so fun that you won't really even need to switch things around to have a great time. Definitely check this out sometime!With online play: I have had some problems with online battles with friends (game freezing up after stage select, player randomly disconnecting after game), but none of these problems were fixed in under a minute and didn't occur that often. Local play is also supported and is a blast!"

In this game you fight your opponents by hitting a ball at them and that's it, on the surface. It's basically an easy to learn and hard to master game.Each character of the 5 you (at least currently) have to choose from has their own abilities, for one they all have different jumps of varying height and I think their movement speed varies too but it might be the visuals tricking me. On top of that they all have different special attacks, one makes the ball warp through the arena wall and come out on the other side, one double swings at the ball to increase the speed by ridiculous amounts and so on. Making use of those skills correctly is what will set you apart from the rest in the end.The game has a singleplayer component but I don't see why you'd wanna play against AI opponents in a game like this.The netcode for the multiplayer seems quite good, but it you want a lag free game I still recommend just going 1 vs 1. From what I gathered it's not perfected for more players yet but it's still posible to play a 4 player free for all with no issues, but know that there might be disconnects or desyncs happening in those.The visuals aren't amazing but for this kind of game they work quite well. Not all games has to be super flashy 3D and stuff, if the game works better with a simple 2D look then that's the better choise in my opinion.The music for the game is great. I haven't heard a track in there that I wish wasn't playing, overall really good sound effects too.I personally recommend playing on a controller but I'm sure it works fine on keyboard too, all keys are cusomizable for your comfort.Scores for those who need them:Graphics - 7 - It fits the style of the game but I'd be lying if I gave it a higher score.Sound and Music - 8.5 - Overall great, but not quite enough to get me to want the soundtrack.Gameplay - 9.5 - For such a simple game it's amazingly fun, probably even more so if you have three friends to play with.Overall score - 8.4 - I recommend you get it, if you're hesistant wait for a sale :D"

The bots have been criticized, but I can always find a pretty good challenge with them. Very high skill ceiling, and a great game overall. Buy it; if you're cheap, wait until it's on sale, but BUY IT. You won't regret it."

I definitely didn't expect how subtly complex the mechanics are, but I've been hooked since I picked it up a week ago. It doesn't feel like a fighting game to me, which is good because I'm not usually a fan of fighting games. Also, the developers seem to be still adding content; it could certainly use more characters and game types. Online multiplayer has been great the several times I've used it, although there doesn't seem to be too many people online as I almost always end up in a 1v1. At $14USD, it's definitely a buy."

Just the joy of smacking a ball with a skateboard while playing as a super advanced robot wearing a sleaze hat and KOing someone just gets me off. The mechanics are easy to learn, but hard to master. Be prepared to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked by the AI when trying to learn the game.This game has different modes including a standard 4 player arena, training, challenge mode (♥♥♥♥ this mode), and solo practice. You can play FFA with 4 people or 1 v 1s (which IMO are less hectic and more fun). You can also play as 2 v 2 teams in the arena which makes up for interesting matchups.Where this game shines is in its soundtrack. My god how well it plays with the game. Its upbeat, techno style music just pumps adrenaline in me, especially when the ball goes at fast speeds. Did I mention that already? Everytime someone hits the ball, it picks up in speed. It starts off in small increments and gets larger by the second. Eventually the ball is going SO fast its just a blur and a step foward on the screen can get you killed. I cannot express how much fun trying to pin down the ball is when literally no one know wtf to do.Lethal League is an easy game to run, almost no problems (there's always that one dude who disconnects in the middle of a game, thus laggin' it up for everyone) and has guaranteed hours of fun in it. But be warned fellow Leaguers, this little ""Candyman"" ♥♥♥♥♥ character is the craziest thing (OP IMO) I've ever seen. His special ability can teleport the ball anywhere, and is super annoying. I'm learning how to counter it now (must stay calm), but in the end it feels so rewarding when you beat someone using him. Lethal League is a game I highly recommend, watch yt videos on it or something BE EXPOSED TO ITS AWESOMENESS. Tanks fer t8king teh time 2 reed my reviw m8 <3."

I find it strange because the cast is such that no one feels weak and everyone has some interesting tricks to pull, which is weird because there are so few options to really mess with.I feel as if the game was made twice. It feels as if the game was made with cold precision as there are only ever subtle differences between characters (excluding supers) and levels yet they change so much between timing and angles and everything that they are all unique and feel different to play with. I also feels loved, to an insane level. Each character has so much to them dispite almost nothing being given.

That's where the Aperture Sceince Acceleration Rod come in. You put that peice of science into your favorite weapon of choice and when that ball is burning ozone towards your head, you just swing it and smash it right back even faster then before.Greg here tells me that if some how that ball makes contact with you without being contained by the Acceleration Rod, all the electrons in your body will change into white light waves and you'll shoot right through the Earth's core. Now don't you worry Old Jokr Goblin here has you covered. We'll bend the path of your electrons so you'll just pass through the Aperture Science Prism Collector and you'll just drop back down from the ceiling like nothing even happened to you.The Prism Collector can only do this five times per person before too much your mass is absorbed by Earth's mass, but to bend time and space to your will is certainly the cost.

,Recommended,261180,22346744,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,"The ""Nation State"" of Somalia","Let me start off by saying that this is more of a party game then a full fledged fighter or anything.  That's the beauty of Lethal League though is it aims to keep the fun simple with a delightful mechanic and well animated and imaginative characters and music.  Here are my lists of Pros and Cons by CatagoryGameplay- Pros:  This game is fast paced and has a mechanic revolving around a ball that kills upon impact from another player's succesful swing and hit.  the object of the game is to knock out the other fighters ala super smash bros or other arcade fighters by smashing the ball their way in hopes that they will not have the reaction time to swing back and be slammed out of the arena.  The gameplay is fast and addictive and best experienced with friends and is highly based on reaction time and the ability to angle the ball or juke other players with the ""bunt"" function or special hits that build up as you hit/bunt the ball.  In short it's a fun arcadey baseball deathmatch game with a simple but unique mechanic.Gameplay-  Cons:  The single player ""challenge"" mode(this games version of super smash bros's classic mode) leaves much to be desired and is quite simple, and while the ai can be challennging for a new player at first it is never as difficult as a real player leaving multiplayer the best option.  There are multiple game modes but most players seldom use or even have fun with them, and the game could use more content on the single player and gameplay mode selection side overall.Graphics- Pros:  The art style and characters are lovingly inspired from a variety of sources most notably I see hints of super smash bros characters and jetset radio style stlye.  You have a baseball loving tough kid, a woman that uses a boombox on a stick as a bat, a man with a piece of candy for a head, and a cyborg alligator, and a robot(who uses a skateboard as his bat and means to get around), and a man named Dice...who oddly enough uses a ping pong paddle.  The art is lovingly design and the stages and characters have a lot of personalityGraphics- Cons:  The characters could use a few more animation touch ups and overall new animations I'd argue and the art style is sometimes used to cover up what is a seemingly simple engine, the stages could use some work too and I feel some of them while inspired could use even more touchups and design changes both aesthetically, and gameplay wise(they are all essentially boxes)Music/Audio- Pros:  This is where the game really shines in the music department.  If you enjoyed Jetset Radio at all you will feel more then welcome and at home here then you have in a game since that series.  The music is incredibly well done and produced and I'll sometimes find myself wanting to play certain stages in the game just to hear the tunes.  ""Ordinary Days"" is a personal favorite of mine though all the tracks of each stage and menu are seething with excellent production and unique ""garage future"" tones.Music Audio- Cons:  The characters are lacking in some voice overs and you'll often hear the same voice clips over and over again.  This is not all bad as some lines are quite clever but I really wish the dev team would give them a bit more life with some new and alternate lines.----Overall the game is pretty fun if you have some buddies itching for some crazy arcadey multiplayer.  It can get pretty intense as the ball speed ramps up higher and higher until the stages are tearing at the seams.  I don't recommend purchasing it at full price however, I would wait for a price drop or a sale to pick this rad, lovable, indie arcade fighter in the future.""Check this!"""

Call it “gut feeling game design.” Double/half is a mechanic (concept?) people immediately understand. It makes Lethal League easy to teach, usually laying out the groundwork with:-Hit the other player with the ball.-Every time you hit the ball it goes faster.-Smash the ball to double the speed.Doubling is the interesting part. It immediately gives strength and weakness. Combine this with bunting ((halvingish speed and giving possession (the ability to win) to all players)) super moves, (break the rules) and ball parry (prevent the ball from being taken) you got mechanics that curate multidimensional bouts.If there’s anything off about Lethal League it’s the characters. Outside of Raptor, there isn’t unity in design.Lethal League is a fantastic competitive game, and an amazing party starter."

I'm about 8 hours in and I've already maxed level and beaten the arcade mode once. But we have an old saying in the male community. ""It's not the size, it's how you use it"". This game is horrendously fun in multiplayer. The controls are tight and the netcode is top notch quality. The game relies on two things to make multiplayer fun: Satisfaction value and reaction time. Luckily, it nails both of them. First of all, I'll actually explain the game. It works in a small square room (One of five maps) and a ball spawns in the middle. Every time a player hits the ball, it becomes his color and it cannot hurt him, only his enemies. While hitting the ball he can also do two things: Aiming the ball up or down and activating his special ability. The special abilities add some depth due to learning how each should be used to the best effect. For example, one characters special allows the ball to travel through walls for a little while. At first I only tried to fake people out with it on the ground, and catch them unawares. But over time I learned that if I applied an aim to it I could cause it to go flying through the ground and the cieling at an angle, which is incredibly hard to perdict and dodge accordingly. Alright, on to the aforementioned satisfaction value. As the ball gets to higher and higher velocites, each smacking of the ball results in the player smacking the ball for not only about 5-6 seconds straight, but also the screen freaking out to high hell. So basically, every time you hit the ball, it feels like you just punched through the earth. Additionally, the music is some of the best I've ever heard in a video game. The tracks are nice and varied, with each track seemingly blending in with the endless sounds of the ball getting smacked into the fifth dimension. The one aspect which can devide people is the art style. It's a simplistic art style, no doubt, but some will find it attractive and some will find it boring. It's really just a matter of opinion. All in all, it's a blast with friends and the soundtrack is amazing, but if you just want to find a good solo experience, I don't know why you're looking at an arena fighting game."

Okay, it doesn't sound that cool on paper but beleive me this concept works without a doubt!There are six characters to chose from: Candyman, Sonata, Raptor, Switch, Dice and Latch, they all have plenty of skins ('Flavours' as the game calls them) to chose from. All of the characters play the same except from their Special Move (Which, if you're familiar with Super Smash Brothers, is sort of like every characters 'Final Smash') I would have prefered If the Characters had different moves than eachother as this would make each of them feel a lot more special rather than a simple palette swap.The game also features a leveling system in which each time you level up, you gain a new flavour for each character. There is also a Challenge mode in which you fight each character one after and they get progessivly get stronger as you fight more.The soundtrack in the game is amazing, consisting of high-pace electronic music which fits the pace of each match perfectly.The controls, whilst confusing at first, feel very fluid and give a great experience. The game plays a lot like Super Smash Brothers with a primary move, secondary move and a big finishing 'Special move'PROS:Great SoundtrackHigh replay value thanks to Online and Challenge modeFluid controlsCONS:Characters feel 'Copy and Pasted'"

I wouldn't recommend just playing the game alone, definitely make sure you have some friends to play with because it's so rewarding!While the small roster of characters is both a pro and con, I think the small cast helps me feel like I can connect to the cast a lot better and find the one I like, however the con is that it is small.

,Recommended,261180,28210781,"Posted: 5 December, 2016",all,oxbudy,"Lethal League is easily my favorite indie game of all time. It mixes an excellent blend of skill and experience into a game that is deceptively simple looking. Getting better at the game gives you a great sense of accomplishment as you go from helplessly spamming the swing key in your early days, to predicting the angle in which the ball will bounce off the walls and positioning yourself to intercept it before it even leaves your opponent's swing.Supported by a tight and friendly community, people can ask for practice or advice from people with far more experience than them.The only downside of the game is the cost and player count, which are not mutually exclusive. While you can still find players, it takes a few minutes rather than a few seconds from the glory days of the game. This can potentially make it harder for new players to get in, as they may have to choose whether to continue to play against someone who destroys them or potentially wait for 5+ minutes in a queue. It can be hard to justify a $14 purchase on a game where getting a fair, fast match isn't guaranteed. However, the game goes on sale fairly often.Despite these risks, I think that a purchase of Lethal League is one that somebody with a competetive spirit owes themselves. Even if you cannot find a game using matchmaking, it shouldn't be too hard to find someone willing to play in the multiple steam groups for the game.This game is legendary. Have fun."

But after leaving it to gather dust in my library for a few months, I decided I wanted to go back to it. But I booted up the game and, no matter what graphics settings it was set to, the game only ran at a maximum of 25 fps. Other than that, the game is great.

Up to four players smash a floating baseball around an enclosed arena with the goal of striking the opposing players with the ball. The players all begin with eight lives. The winner is the last one standing. Six different characters are available to choose from, each one with unique angles for striking the ball, individual special attacks, and particular jump heights. Skill, technique, and mindgames are tested in each match, and only one may win in a battle to the death.The simplicity of the controls provide a low barrier to entry to allow players of all skill levels to compete, at which point strategy and technique come into play much earlier than other competitive games. Game players initially timid to try Lethal League due to a perceived difficulty curve soon find themselves cheering uproariously at their victories and groaning sorely at their losses, yet smiling cheerfully all the while. This game really brings out a competitive spirit in the people I’ve played with, most of whom don't play games regularly, while keeping things fun."

This game is a wonderful crossover between a sporty type game like tennis, pong, or baseball, with the mechanics of popular fighters like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. The game has an excellent electronic soundtrack that perfectly fits the dirt-punk aesthetic the game pulls off with aplomb. The only issue the game has is it is built around being multiplayer, and the game is just not popular enough and the servers not strong enough to really support the game. What I would do if I were you is get this game with a handful of friends so you have someone to play with.  Also, make sure to participate in the little community the game has. They hold tournaments every weekend that allow you to be sure other players are there to play with you."

It may even be more successful than Smash Bros. at blending the line between fighting game and party game, as the insane flash and hype lives right alongside the fluid, intuitive controls and deep combat mechanics. There is no need to include tons of items and random stage hazards to even the playing field because the core mechanic is so simple to pick up and learn that within just a few games even your friend who says they hate fighting games will be slugging with the best of them.This is all wrapped up in a crisp, clean pixel art style with a great cast of characters that anyone can pick a favorite from and an insanely catchy soundtrack that will have you picking stages based purely on the song that plays on it.The only actual downside to this game is a complete lack of an online community, which is an absolute shame. It is pretty much impossible to connect to anyone to play online, which means if you aren't lucky enough to have a group to play this consistently, the AI vs mode and the challenge mode won't tide you over for long.

In a good way tho.Get Lethal League if you have someone else to play with and like testing your wits and reflexes against other human beings in an arena of momentum and angle physics.

And those who do have 200 ping. Yesterday I tried to play this game when I saw there was literally no one playing as I sat there for minutes waiting for a match. This game is fantastic otherwise. I reccomend you buy it so we can build up a community of people so there is a nice flow of players."

I can't express to you how simple this game is, but how it can be taken to an entire new level, given enough experience. It's not just hitting a ball back and forth: it's timing your hits, learning the geometry of where the ball will bounce, positioning to make sure your hit connects.Great with 4 players, truly amazing with two. Grab two copies, play with a friend. I promise you won't be disappointed if you're even slightly interested."

Head toreddit.com/r/lethalleagueand find tournaments or group game days because there doesn't seem to be a huge playerbase anymore."

,Recommended,261180,34391180,Posted: 21 August,all,MangaEngel,"Fast, challenging and downright insane.If F-Zero is one of the fastest racing games, then this is one of the fastest beat-em-ups. With a crazy combination of ball game and fighting, be prepared to strain your concentration when you try to find the perfect moment to hit the ball into your opponents face!If you never had a reason to be scared of a ball, this game will give you more than one reason!Graphics:The graphics are cartoony, gritty and occassionally as crazy as the game itself. Despite being handdrawn, the animation is perfectly fluid. The backgrounds are nice to look at yet not distracting in the least and the color coding makes it always easy to know who has control over the ball.Music:Each character got their own voice with a set of yells and noises, the music is a funky set of electronic music perfectly fit for the speed of the game.Gameplay:Play story mode and fight one up to three AIs, with or without time limit, with or without teams. Play against friends locally or online. Change tagging to allow instant kills, change speed up to 200km/h with one hit. Hit the ball normally, use special skills that confuse your enemies.The moment you think you know how it works, change the rules and start from the beginning. This game can't be boring. Ever.Other:While the story mode is fun, this game HAS to be played with friends. Ideally by friends that are about as good at it as you."
