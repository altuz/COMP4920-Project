,Recommended,261490,11608955,"Posted: 8 August, 2014",all,shoggofu,"I've played for two hours and was actually able to complete the game in this time. Initially I was uncertain whether it was a good choice considering that it's got $20 price tag, however;- It was overall really really fun, it's buggy but some of the bugs made the game even more entertaining- BUT the full game isn't actually available yet, you will reach a sign saying after only an hour or two that says 'end of early access, check for updates’ and a dead endhttp://youtu.be/kfPwOlYgAlchttp://youtu.be/Qeft_KXzh0MOkay to start off with you are are in a world with a theme that borrows heavily from Quake II. I loved that game. You get to play as a Strogg. They don't actually call themselves Strogg but I'm just going to refer to them as Strogg. I was very happy to get to be a Strogg =). I decapitated my superior officer with my salute and off I went. Initially combat wasn't so great. You have a blaster but it's nowhere near as cool as the real Quake II blaster. I found it hard to aim, you need to be very precise and I found it hard to fine tune aiming with the mouse in this game. However after playing for sometime I found aiming easier, so I may have just needed time to adjust. I still think your projectiles need to be bigger, especially your rockets. By the way the rocket launcher in this game has an identity crisis, it doesn’t know whether its a rocket launch or a rail gun lol. I soon found myself in a section playing domination i.e. capture all the points against the AI. That part is a bit of a work in progress, I think they could flesh it out quite a bit more. After taking the points I fought a boss in the next area. It was a cool Quake II style cyborg tank._____However I had trouble progressing through this section. At first it just killed me because it was too strong. Then I was unable to confront it again several times because the guard you need to kill to trigger the boss fight just wouldn't die no matter how many limbs I chopped off of him. So I had to reload and start from the end of the last area a few times until it worked. It also took me a while to discover the chaingun you need to defeat the boss._____Combat started to get more fun at this stage, mainly because there were more enemies. Sometimes you have specific objectives but they can be a little buggy or apparently not fully implemented e.g. at one point I was supposed to proceed to a tower and destroy it. However as soon as I made my way to the tower I was given the next objective without having destroying a thing. Gameplay mainly consists of heading to the next area and fighting through the enemies._____Along the way were some sort of alternate dimension instances filled with purple metallic platforms as well. There wasn't much to these areas but they were interesting locations, sort of like a non-organic version of the alternate dimension in the Half-Life series._____There is one bug at the moment which persistently made the game difficult and apparently it is something to do with the gravity levels. I found that when I reloaded after dying the gravity is for some reason extremely high. You are unable to jump, jump pads a rendered useless and for some reason it creates a really big frame rate drop. Until this bug is fixed in a patch the only way I could find to return the game to normal is by restarting it. This doesn't take long to do, just use quicksave so that you don't lose any progress. There is a bright side to this issue, it causes enemies to do cart-wheels when they die =)After completing the Strogg act you find yourself in a World War II themed area fighting Germans on your way to church. Unfortunately the game ends before you get to your destination. I never actually saw some of the locations and weapons featured in the screenshots on the steam page.The game doesn't look too bad. Obviously it is intended to look like older titles. Make sure you choose the right aspect screen ratio in the display menu. For some reason mine was incorrect by default and I spent the first half hour or so unable to see most of my HUD. Also the game looked a lot better after tweaking this._____Did I mention that I really liked being a Strogg? =) You retain this form throughout the game even during the WW2 section, which was cool._____I found several visually entertaining bugs or unintended features. You can pick up dropped enemy weapons with E and launch them out of the map with left click. You can pick up corpses and flail them about around like Ragdolls. Sometimes amputated limbs of enemies will roll continuously without stopping. I sliced of a Strogg's head and it rolled all the way across a large room bounced off the wall and kept on rolling. Usually the AI is good at aggressively finding you and hunting you down but sometimes enemies spin around continuously or walk around and around in tight circles. If you shoot enemies with the crossbow it takes them to the ground in a low arc and pins them there instead of carrying them at high speed to the surface behind them. Some of the stuff I saw I think should be left as it is =)_____The dialogue wasn't always amazing sometimes it was amusing. I found it a bit painful to hear feigned American accents however, especially when I had to repeat that scene multiple times. Some of the sound effects sound like they are straight out of familiar old titles, which was pretty good for nostalgic reasons.So yeah I did enjoy enjoy playing this. But I do think $20 is a bit much for what you are getting at least at the moment. I was expecting a full albeit buggy game. Yes I would have preferred not to have been set back so much to buy this game. But I'm not too worried about it personally. However I'm pretty sure it's guaranteed that a lot of people would not be happy to pay $20 for what they would get get in this case."
,Not Recommended,261490,32707319,Posted: 23 June,all,slingmasta,"I really wanted to like this game. The main selling point of Bedlam, and what initially drew my attention, is the story and concept, a stroll through video game history of sorts. Most levels are inspired by classic FPS games like Quake, Call of Duty, and Halo, while a few segments riff on other genres as well. One level sees the player running as a giant through a RTS map, while another has the player playing through Pac-Man in the first-person, a unique and exhilarating experience to say the least. This concept, coupled with (mostly) well-done voice acting and a slew of humorous gaming references makes for a genuinely compelling background. It is wonderful to see some of your favorite games riffed on, and I was constantly thrilled at seeing the many classic game references or motifs the developers would throw in each level.All of that being said, I would not easily recommend this game. There is nothing glaringly ""wrong"" with Bedlam so to say, but the experience as a whole is marred with glitches, inconsistencies, and overall weak game structure. Beyond the textures and scenery, level design is often confusing and uninspired. Platforming segments between levels are repetitive and only serve as tools to allow for plot development while combat levels have little sense of dynamics or structure, meaning maneuvering through the game is often tedious. Enemies are not particularly fun to fight against, and the gunplay and movement is clunky and dry; all in all, Bedlam does little to imitate the fine-tuned gameplay of the titles it parodies, let alone provide any real sense of mechanical quality. Maybe the final straw was how glitchy this game was to me: a single play though of the game (which took me maybe three or four hours) saw me crash to the desktop six times: totally unacceptable for a modern video game.Again, the concept is unique and exciting. I won’t say I didn’t enjoy my time playing Bedlam. Shooting my way through video game history was certainly a breath of fresh air in a world where shooting Russian special forces has become de rigueur. I only wish that the developers had spend as much time on game design as they had on concept creation."

It's one of those games you have to play, just to experience it.I put nearly five hours into this game, and finished the early access in one sitting. I'm genuinely disappointed there's not more to play yet.The storyline is... confusing, but I gather that it's supposed to be. I want to see where it goes. I am committed to this wild ride.The game is pretty self-aware, ticking off tropes like there's an achievement for including them all, and manages to balance the vast array of weapons from genre to genre and era to era well too.However, the game is not without its faults too.In the obligatory sewer level, there is a conversation with an NPC that triggers at a certain point. I was mobbed by zombies and died before the end of the conversation, and reloaded. This time, the conversation didn't trigger, and I spent a full 45 minutes in the sewer, attempting to find an exit that apparently only appears after the conversation has finished.In the WW2 level, the enemy soldiers will sometimes run around in circles when you shoot them. I'm not sure if this is satirising dodgy AI, or is actually dodgy AI.Overall, none of the problems are deal-breakers; and the game itself is full of dark, quirky humour, interesting concepts, and fast-paced, fun gameplay.Worth every penny."

That's not a parody, that's just making a terrible game.When the game first starts you're placed in what you assume is a parody of a low budget FPS game, like some russian made starseige:tribes.  It tricks you. You're having fun enough, Jumping around fast, shooting dumb enemies with simple weapons.  It's not terrible, and there's a little bit of humor to keep you going.  Then you change worlds to a WW2 game.  This is where the warning sirens went off. It's not like any WW2 FPS game. It's not wolfenstein, it's not call of duty, it certainly isn't medal of honor either.  Instead I'd have to compare it to a super linear city level from BF1942, where you're (almost) forced to clear out  building after copypasted building of nazi snipers. There's about one joke in this level.  The WW2 fps genre has so many things you could be parodying and pointing fun at, hell, where's the d-day invasion where you're charging the beach? Instead, like I mentioned earlier you just go through bland city blocks clearing out buildings so aimbotting snipers (with no tracers)  don't murder you. It wasn't fun. It wasn't challenging. It was just awful.I couldn't make it much farther because I realized that the game wasn't going to improve. You get more guns, but none of them are interesting at all.   Did the developers actually play quake or UT?  There's no silly UI changes between levels, there's not even a BLOOD ALL OVER WHEN YOU GET SHOT SO REALISTIC joke in there.  Instead inbetween levels occasionally you might find an ancient image macro that you might chuckle at (or most likely want to facepalm).There are a few good jokes in the game, and the protoganist is extremely scottish, but it's just such a bad GAME that none of it is worth slogging through."

The idea is very cool, the writing is decent, and the voice acting is very cute. But there's a problem: making a game about glitchy games is not an excuse to make a glitchy game. And a good concept is wasted with bad execution.As an actual videogame, Bedlam is a pain to play. I have endured it to hear the story, but it was hardly worth it. The levels are vast, half-empty mazes where you get lost with no idea where to go and keep trying different paths just to end up jumping outside the map or getting stuck in the terrain. I would applause if it was an actual game mechanic, but it's not, it's just crappy level design. The enemies are disappointing, and their animation is so bad that the game itself references it (no, it's not an automatical excuse either).Bedlam is not a good game, but a proof of its makers' talent and creativity. Buy it if you want to support an aspiring indie developer. If you just want to have a good time playing a game, look elsewhere."

,Recommended,261490,12420820,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,the fourth man,"Early acces is a tricky proposition, so whenever you are tempted to buy one of those games there´s a little hesitation involved.  This is a game that tries to take old styles of FPS gaming to the front and add a modern sensibility, this usually is a complicated affair because the shooting is the easy part, is one of the most elemental forms of interaction in game design, what usually feels off about this kind of endeavours is the movement, the way you move in the game world is bastly different, if you are old enough you can  remember it, and usually there´s a disonance in what you remember and what you feel playing a game that tries to infuse modern movement in retro shooters and it can lead to some dissatisfaction, there´s some of this in Bedlam too, is unavoidable to an extent, but the game succeds in its graphic presentation and you can find your self smiling remembering old exploits.The acting is pretty good, the weapons feel good to shoot for the most part, there´s some rough edges of course, but the game runs pretty well overall, right now you can easily end the game in under three hours, but the devs are pretty active in the forums and they are adding content, they have announced two more worlds, and are polishing the existing ones, i truly enjoyed my time with it and hope to continue doing it with the next additions, so far no regrets with this game, but remember is early access and if you have any caveats with it you may want to wait for the finished version, i for sure plan to keep playing and replaying it"

Especially the combat, which is so clunky and bad that the NPCs probably have it better than you. Guns felt weak and were bad, a single Nazi could survive a full shotgun blast to the chest, and you'd think being in the MoH part of the game that wouldn't be the case. Overrall a really hopeful game that got so lost in it's nostalgia and story that it completely threw aside everything else.I wanted to like it, and at first I did, but you just can't play a game with combat like this."

If you grew up on oldschool shooter games- from Doom, to Quake, to COD, Timesplitters, Halo- and if you dev games, you owe it to yourself to play this. The shooting mechanics are fun and simple, the dialogue is very well done. Everything about this game screams bittersweet nostalgia- it's a love letter to games past and present. It may be a bit rough around the edges in parts, but it's very entertaining. If you've read Ready Player One- yea, it's kinda like that too. <3 this game!"

Both were bad. The controller support is almost unusable. And it is funny, because there are enough controller options which would lead one to believe things could be remedied. The problem is mostly when turning left or right. Turning: nothing...nothing...nothing...MOVE REALLY FAST. That's about the best away I can explain it. Yes, I tried all kinds of sensitivity options. I tried auto aim and 'stickyness', too.I just felt like I was spending wayyy too much time fighting with the controls, and not the enemy.As far as what I experienced with the game? Yeah, it plays like a 90's shooter. Is this bad? Not particularly, but there is a reason why shooters have evolved since then. Things have gotten better.The voice acting is good. The level design was 'meh'. The storyline probably had potential, but I can't finish due to the overwhelming frustration with the controls.Peace,"
,Not Recommended,261490,33596057,Posted: 16 July,all,Evaheist,"A very flawed shooter with a cool story that doesn't get anywhere and ends with a sudden cliffhanger. The shooting itself actually feels nice. It's got a little Unreal Tournament and Quake in it but the weapons are boring and the constant platforming sections really get on the nerve specially towards the ending.Level design is atrocious and most of the jokes fall pretty flat. The graphics aren't optimized to run smoothly at all. I'd get constant hiccups while playing. The missions are boring, the maps are confusing and the A.I is all about running towards you while shooting. The voice acting is amusing.The game can get really tough and seem like a grind but for 4-5 hours it's an ok experience. It's one of those games where it's more about style than substance but here the style falls pretty flat as well.It's got its moments and it's not particularly a bad shooter but Bedlam plays like an early access title that never got finished; at least it's playable. I must admit even though I still had some fun while it lasted, I can't really recommend it unless you manage to grab it for next to nothing."

I like the story, I like the idea of bringing players through the history of gaming, I even like playing as a foul mouthed scottish woman. I've never played a scottish woman before and I even got to learn a bunch of new scottish swears (""I was playing games while you were in ya nappies ya wee fud""). But the gameplay is just so boring. Running around giant maps which look the same at every point no matter where you are trying to find that one specific object, fighting the same 3 or 4 enemies over and over (who happen to have really dull AI), and just trying to navigate the mazes that some of the areas are. It just wore down on me until I no longer wanted to play.So yeah, a little disappointing. If the story does it for you alone then go for it. The story's good. Everything else fumbles a bit."
,Recommended,261490,22598260,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,rodrigogarlop,"Bedlam is not without its flaws but it certainly is a must for gamers who have grown up with classic FPS hits like Quake, Unreal, Medal of Honor, etc. The game itself is a little rough around the edges and I found some medium bugs at the later stages but players who manage to get past them may find a rare, though brilliant, gem fueled by nostalgia.I enjoyed the story, mainly because it is full of references to some 80s and 90s cult classics and general pop culture trends. Combat is just so so but it  kind of reminds me of some of those oldschool games. The control scheme should be improved, particularly because there are too many weapons and you cannot access them all via single keys. Scottish voices are uncommon in videogames but it does sound somewhat refreshing to hear different accents.I had a difficult time in platform sections, which were frustrating to some extent but I think that it is not that bad if you keep on quick saving.To summarize, I would really recommend this game to oldschool gamers who still love old FPS, nostalgia retro gamers in general and anyone who is curious about the evolution of FPS gaming. People who are more used to Halo, CoD or Battlefield may find it slow paced and the AI too simple. But, as a tribute to some good old games it is great."

76561197980325111,Recommended,261490,29818297,Posted: 9 February,all,Sir_Cool,"I remember seeing a trailer for this game a while back and being very intrigued by the concept of it. A journey through multiple games through different eras and genres (primarily FPS). Well if that's what makes you want to play this game, you're in luck. It's that unique concept alone that carries the game. You play as Athena, a woman suddenly trapped inside the world of a 90's first-person shooter. One that obviously represents Quake, Unreal Tournament and the like. Seeing what can only be described as mock low-res textures running in HD, is jarring at first but eventually charming as it feels like a great throw back. Even being thrown into a fake multiplayer match. Complete with young teen aged boys chirping each other over headsets, making references to COD, hacking, etc.Eventually you'll be thrown into a World War II game, akin to Call of Duty. Though of course you arrive in that high-res realistic world with all your sci-fi attributes and weaponry. Again, it is this mesh of aesthetics that really make that game interesting and keep you playing. Just to see what's next. Ever wonder what it's like to play PAC-Man in first person? In a way it reminds me of Timesplitters. Just in that you are consistently exploring very different environments.The character you play as, Athena, is charming and fun to listen to. I'm sure the Scottish accent helps. Making on the nose video game references throughout. You meet other characters trapped in this video game world limbo and slowly start to unravel the story of what's going on and how you got there. Although - you'll have to dig a tad deeper through a series emails you can view through the game to really learn the lore. Personally, I found the ending a little unsatisfying, but that could be seen as subjective.The unique combination of aesthetics and decent storytelling are definitely the high points though. As the game play comes off as mediocre. Fairly bland no matter which game world you find yourself traversing through. It works, but nothing about any of the weapons you'll equip feel too satisfying. And despite all the game worlds you'll get to explore, the enemies feel very limited in terms of variety. The AI is very meh as well. One aspect that really irked me was the jumping. Particularity when exploring the ""glitch"" world, as we'll call it. Essentially the area you go through between games. Closer to the end when these glitch worlds become more full fledged levels, there are a few minor platforming elements. I played the game on medium difficulty, but found these simple jumps were the only thing killing me. Sometimes it's just very easy to miss a platform. The game has reasonable checkpoints throughout. Though you could save-scum your way through the game. I'm the kind of person who avoids that whenever possible. Though I couldn't help myself during these small platforming moments.Overall I would recommend this game if the concept of the game alone hooks you. Despite the bland game play, the game is short enough that you'll be satisfied with the unique experience."

For a game that's like ""hey yo, remember classic games like Quake?"" its movement system is awful, which makes the inbetween-level platforming sections a pain in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The guns feel really unsatisfying and kinda weak (sorry but I expect a rocket launcher to be a bit more devastating than that), and you get them in such a seemingly random order that it makes cycling through your inventory tedious and annoying. The level design can be quite good at times but pro-tip developers: a nudge and a wink when you start your sewer level doesn't change the fact that you're choosing to making me go through a sewer level. I didn't really care about the story, I just wanted to romp through a few different eras of FPS gaming, but the few lines that did make me laugh didn't take the edge off the terrible delivery.Overall it feels like a game that could've done with a few more months to just polish things off and put a real shine on things, but instead it's just another bog-standard FPS that's neither good nor bad. Get it on sale if you're really into the genre, but at full price don't bother, you can get far better for a tenner than this."

Like one stranger bug, you can Pick Up an object you're standing on and fly!The mix of older graphics and newer technology in the older areas feels slightly odd (Like early 1990's had no ragdoll physics which are now common - Used hit-boxes instead of model-hits), but the odd feeling you get from these mis-matches helps sell the story about being in the game when you're not supposed to be.

Normally I would wait to review a game like Bedlam, which is still in early access, until I at least had put more hours in...but because it's on sale as I write this, at an even better price then the Holiday Sale when I got it, I had to relate that I feel this game justified FULL price within the first ten minutes of playtime, and hasn't since let down, at least for me. It is challenging and engaging, and never feels like it copies too much from any of the games it salutes...it even mentions some by name, yet there is a fresh feel that's fun, exciting and there's still more to come...not to mention I also have a lot more yet to experience with what is already here. Best of all is there are areas, apart from following where the game leads you, that take you into what feels like a whole other dimension, and salute different games altogether, then take you back to where you would have been if you hadn't drifted off the main path. This game, Bedlam, is like a gift that keeps on giving, especially for those who have a particular fondness of first-person shooters and the games that defined the realm. Don't let my hours of play (at the time of this review, less than 2) take anything away from the extent to which I so highly recommend Bedlam...especially if you see it on sale...but it is totally worth the full price, even when in early access. Worth noting also, that even when my aged game card can't handle many of the newer releases, Bedlam looks awesome and plays awesome and adds to my recommendation.

,Recommended,261490,21894340,"Posted: 17 March, 2016",all,Mostly Harmless :/,"Bedlam is an fps that takes you through a nostalgic tour of various games that are similar but not too legally close to Quake, Medal of Honor, Left 4 Dead, Hexen, Halo, some tank/war game I can't pin down, Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Gradius but in the most shallow ways possible. These trips through other games is purely aesthetic. With the exception of the side-scrolling 2D shooter they don't emulate the style of the games they're aping. The gameplay feels like a mediocre Quake-like where you're always in these massive sprawling environments that are filled with a lot of cut and paste geometry that are themed after the various fps's I mentioned and sparsely populated with some truly brain dead enemies. The only advantage the A.I. has is the distance from which it can start shooting you, this advantage gets quickly erased based off of the weapons you pick up, specifically the rocket and grenade launchers. That's another issue, you start in a Quake-like and got to the MoH-like with Quake-like weapons. After the MoH-like you're in a Hexen-like facing off against melee enemies with shotguns. It's not a competition, it's not challenging. You just mow your way through some spawn waves and move to the next waypoint. Once you get the rail gun, which has plentiful ammo, it's pretty much over. You can one-shot virtually everything in the game. On top of all of this you can rocket jump without penalty, no self-damage, which puts the A.I. at more of a disadvantage but also allows for some ridiculously fast level traversal.The story is kind of enjoyable and is probably what pushed me through the game but I'm glad Bedlam is only five hours long. It didn't overstay its welcome. There's two achievements that I missed earlier to 100% it but I don't think I'll bother to replay the game to get them. Bedlam's not bad but it's something I'd recommend only picking up in a sale."

Not so much.It starts well as a generic sci-fi shooter but then it never really develops as it crosses the genres with the slightly floaty handling and high speed movement. It works well as an old-school shooter but as the selling point is cross genres it doesn't really deliver as all we really get is a re-skin of the first level.It was a bit buggy as well. I got trapped in a few places and saw some considerable clipping and was fired in the air a few times as well. The level design was ok but the voice acting and script was excellent with well portrayed characters. The difficulty was a little random going from stupidly easy to frustratingly hard often within a single level. You will value the quick save key.For a cheap price and if you are fan of Mr Brookmyre it's worth a look.

,Not Recommended,261490,21046303,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,Zilby,"Do NOT buy this game. Looked into it as a way to experience some retro shooters, but aside from some minor nostalgia, instead of taking the best elements from them, Bedlam decides to take the worst.1) Horribly optimized game. I'm running this on a Razer Blade 2015. If you change the resolution, the window size changes meaning that unless I run the game in native 3200p, I have to experience it from a tiny window (NOT fun). Thus, you're forced to run it in your native resolution. Seeing the game's minimal graphics, I wouldn't think this would be a problem, but this game is so poorly optimized, that even on the lowest settings I'm experiencing lag and slowdowns if there's a large area or a large number of enemies, which is absolutely crazy when I can run more demanding games at the same resolution with higher graphics settings.2) Takes everything bad you know from vintage games. Remember objectives so vague that you don't know where to go and end up exploring a bland, untextured environment for 20 minutes to come across something that says ""press enter to continue""? Bedlam has that! Remember enemies that get stuck in invisible walls such that you can't shoot them (even when you literally stand still with a sniper rifle and shoot them in every part of their visible body) yet they can still shoot you? Bedlam has that! Remember levels filled with filler enemies that are nothing more than a waste of your time? Bedlam has a TON of that! Remember platforming sections that are full of boring jumps that take a very long time, but require you to restart the ENTIRE section if you mess up once? Bedlam has those too! Instead of making me remember what I love about vintage shooters, Bedlam stabs them in the back and takes all the WORST elements, and takes out anything meaningfull they contributed to the experience back in the day.3) It tries to hinge its gameplay on a largely uninteresting story. You find yourself suddenly stuck in a video game, there's a bunch of people just like you that can make glitches to move between the games and there's a force that's trying to prevent them from doing so because it spreads ""the corruption"" which causes game worlds to stop existing. I don't know why the game thinks that this premise is so interesting that it doesn't need to contribute ANYTHING else to lead to a fulfilling experience, but it definitely falls a bit flat. The characters are relatively likable, but I feel as though their charm relies more on them all having a quirky Australian accent than them actually being fleshed out characters to any degree.So what does Bedlam do well? It passes itself off as an indie homage to retro FPS's to an unsuspecting audience incredibly well, while instead taking a huge dump on the history it seems to be trying to raise up."

It is very brutal and unfair, with only 1 heath pack that I could find throughout the whole level.  It is a huge level and you can get killed very easily, trying to find anything useful.  There are a ton of empty buildings used to house some enemies, but they only drop ammo and weapons, sometimes...  Other buildings are just empty and are used to lure you to your death from enemies hiding in buildings across from you.The biggest problem is the fog.  The enemy can see and shoot you way before you spot them.  Plus your sniper weapon moves a LOT and theirs do not.  They are dead on snipers and they will kill you fast!  Without health packs, it's only a matter of time before you stop reloading your quick save and quit playing.Then there is the problem of not being able to save during the most intense battle in that level.  IMO, that was a game breaker.  They throw so many enemies at you, it's impossible to get through it without dying.  Then you have to take out a tank with almost zero health!  Even if you back track way back, you cannot save anymore.  It's locked into the ""NO SAVE ZONE!!!""  It is a very frustrating experience!If you have killed any of the soldiers that are in the ""NO SAVE ZONE:, before you trigger the no save feature, and then save your game…  You will have to kill all of the soldiers again, that you lured out of that zone!  It's so frustrating!!!  Again, don't try to lure them out of the no save zone and then save your game.  If you have to reload your save, you'll just have to kill them all over again…  And you WILL have to reload many times trying new strategies, only to die over and over again…Keyboard bindings will not let you bind commands to some key's!  Why can't I bind Left-Shift?  Kind of the norm these days.  So crouching can be rough.  And you really need to crouch a LOT!!!  Another game breaker for me!You also do not stop moving for a second making it hard to judge where you will stop.  This has gotten me killed many times!  Just trying to strafe and shoot is a major chore!   You really need to be accurate and do head shots or the enemy will kill you first!  So movement sucks!  In a FPS, movement is everything!Collision detection is way off and invisible walls are everywhere. Don't expect to use a vehicle as cover then pop out to shoot.  You'll need to step way away from the vehicle to get past that invisible wall.  I have died too many times trying to kill an enemy 2 feet away and never hit him.  Even with the shotgun!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438580301I really wanted to like this game as I said, I was having fun with the first 8 levels.  I'm stuck on level 9 and will probably not ever play again as I got too frustrated!!!  I may try again when the game is finished, but they really need to fix some game breaking problems for me to play this again.  I'll even change this review if they fix the fog and sniper weapon so I can shoot strait.EDIT:  I got past that 9th level.  I restarted it and found health packs and armor everywhere.  Maybe the new patch fixed this problem.  Anyway, now I'm stuck in the sewers with no MAP!!!  Silly game IMO..."

Its another game that trys to pay homage or compliment video games from the 80s and 90s and again fails. Its nothing more than a reminder that for the most part that era was not very good, i know i was there, so let it be. Let it be.In Bedlam you play as a Heather, aka Athena,  a worker for the 'corporation' who volunteers for some brain experiments and then awakens to find herself not only transformed into a half cyborg but transported into the world of video games. Corporate flunky one day killing machine the next as you will fight your way through nostalgic gaming levels in order to escape and learn the truth of what happened. Or will you?In the game just like a FPS you will be going from level to level shooting enmies and flipping a switch here and there. Thats pretty much all Bedlam offers. As you enter each level there will be some banter describing the game level which you are about to enter and while some of the games will be recognizeable(Doom, Quake, Halo, COD, etc.), some not so much. One confusing aspect are these glitches that are scattered across the levels. You enter these glithches and they are bascially a large jumping puzzle where you can regain ammo, health or maybe a weapon. None of which you will ever need. My problem with the glitches is they ALL are the SAME. I can understand if there will only be 2-3 scattered thruought the game but there are 1-2 of these glitches across every level. Why did they not make these almost a one opportunity vs. enemies to retrieve a super weapon?  Or take the time to at least make them different?As this is a game banking on nostalgia one of the few things it does get right is the speed. Moving around is fast and im guessing well over 100fps but that doesn tmake up for the weak weaponary, sound design and enemies who basically are cannon fodder. But this is the thing, thats excatlly 80s-90s shooters so if they were going for authenticity they nailed it.I actually was not so down on the game until the last level where it finally broke me. If you take the time time to kill all the enemies and scrounge around it could take you close to 2 hours. It almost felt as if i was transported back to the beginning of the game becasue all you do is repeat everything you have done against the same enemies just in a matrix like enviroment. I finally grew so bored i learned i was able to basically run past a large chunk of the level to get to the end game. Instead of a boss fight you are given a tedious(die easily) jumping puzzle to kill the machine. Dissapointing is a very genourous statement.Im the first to admit im not nostaglic at all but i do like fast paced shooters today and those that began this crazy hobbey i love. However,  if you are going to make a game today that takes all the ideas from the 80's and 90's and excludes any sort of todays innovations in gaming, then all you are left with is a game from the 80's and 90's.

The screenshots looked promising and the game has been updating quite frequently.My first impressions was outstanding, what an interesting game. Just starting off in the ""simulation"" feels like a Quake/DOOM 2 and Half-Life 1 mix with some good humour. The protagonist is funny but her british accent (as well as the other characters) is really f**king annoying. They even spelt Bieber wrong and said a joke claming ""Justin Beiber is sh*tty"". Yes I said CLAMing, get it? It's funny haha clams instead of claim! Oh wait... that's just a british thing, sorry not funny.Those f**king British devs also like to steal other game content/quotes and include it into their game including; Duke Nukem, Call of Duty, MineCraft, BioShock, Grand Theft Auto, Black Mesa (Half Life), Valve Inc., Halo, AND MORE! There's a lot of game cross-referencing. BUT! There is a reason as of why which I will explain under the SPOILERS section.Anyways, the gameplay is pretty fun. A standard non-ish-linear first person shooter with a lot of collective guns and items hiding around. Strangely if you kill someone and run over their gun you don't pick up the ammo, so you have to look out for them throughout the map, especially health!Alot of the characters do have a meaning and reason of being there with deep interactions with the important ones, giving a great story and twist.*SPOILERS*One stage I thought was super funny; ""The Rage-Quit Reactor"" / Training Stage in the simulation. It's full of little kids that rage and call you a hacker when you kill them, and talk like the typical online children in reality. Lmfao!The stage after, set in World War 2 (Kind of like Day of Defeat Source meets Sniper Elite 1). The germans actually speak Deutsche and swear when they die which was pretty amusing. Shooting them with lasers as they look in shock with their Lugers and MP40's. Claiming (or claming? no no sorry Britain not this time) that the American's have super Artificial Intelligence.So bascially you're stuck in a simulation and get tossed around different kinds of games. Games that are well known in real life (Quake, Halo, etc.). This is why they reference other games to give it a real-life feel... sounds like hardcore plagerism to me.Your inventory builds up with old/new gen weapons so carrying them over into another game which helps benefit against the enemies is a pretty good feature.Killing all those b*stard, enemies, that we really don't know much of, yet!?Overall, besides the annoying and sh*tty typical British voice acting, this game is very pleasing! A great storyline and interesting characters with addicting gameplay. My game although did get stuck at a point where I had to defend a spawn point from the enemies. I did, but the game never recognized that I completed it and was stuck in a loop. Re-loading the game, the mission to defend was never even brought up. So that was game over for me woo I win!!!7/10"

,Recommended,261490,24331245,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,Prologue-9,"I picked this game up and playtested it throughout most of its Early Access run up to release. At first I was madly in love with the game, from all the tounge-in-cheek references to old games like Quake 2, earlier CoDs, some DOS classics - it spoke to me as someone who grew up with all those titles. The gameplay was fast and frantic, some of the levels were designed real well, and overall, I was satisfied.And then I read the book.Now the game dissapointed me. SO much potential...But aside from that, on it's own it has some issues. Pretty much all enemy AI just stands still trying to shoot you, the cover-shooter levels leave something to be desired, and a lot of your time is gonna be spent just running around in dead silence, without enough music to fill the void. That being said, high points of this game are in its superb voice acting, with a memorable main-character. You get to carry over weapons from gameworld to gameworld, so you can blast nazis with pixellated buckshot, or fight cyborgs with halo-era tech. The graphical fidelity in each world matches it's era, and it's really neat seeing the progression as you go along.Gunplay is...relatively basic, as it has to be considering enemy AI, but it's servicable. At points there's a lot of variety in the level design and mission objectives. My say is that you get the game just to try it out (and nostalgia bonus, Quake fans), and if you find yourself interested in the world, pick the book up and read through that - you'll be in for a muuuuch fuller ride."

If that doesn't sound particularly glowing, it's because it's not meant to be. I enjoyed it, so I'd potentially recommend it, but I'm not crazy about it, and I probably won't play it again."

Frustratingly laggy until I turned off FXAA, lots of glitches and disappearing objects. Nothing game-breaking, but that shouldn't happen with a game that went through early access.If you grew up in the nineties and know games like Quake, Doom, Half-Life, Warcraft, Command&Conquer, etc because you actually PLAYED them, get this game!"

However, bad level design and mediocre and repetitive gameplay really hold it back. I had fun playing it, but it could and should have been better."
