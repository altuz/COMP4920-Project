He never played it, but I did. I'm 41 now. This game brought it all back with such a great fedora-tip to the golden age of FMV games and Tex Murphy fans alike ('It sure is good to have the ol' Muyph back!') Now that I've finished the game and my brain isn't stimulated by puzzles and witty banter, I sadly go back to my FPS killing and sigh and wish I was booting up Tesla effect again for the first time. It's a great experience for Tex fans or newcomers, I'm so glad you guys got the chance to come back for one more hurrah and thank you so much! (I didn't know about the Kickstarter or I would have chipped in!) Also, whichever one of you is the conspiracy-nut you did a great job on the Tesla research, good stuff. p.s.

From the days when FMV was the future...or so they thought. The puzzles are clever but not to the point were they induce headaches - but not so easy that you can breeze through them. The main issues was the large amount of unused space in the hub area - this was pretty common in the 90s. Big areas with not a lot in them. It was clear that some areas were intended to be populated but it did not reach its all kick starter goals. This was a nice slice of nostalgia. If you have a hankering for point and click 90s style, when this type of game was at the height of its popularity, then please try this one. 8/10"

Funny Characters & a lot of humour - but on the other side, there are a few lengthy passages.

I've been a fan of Tex Murphy adventures since Mean Streets (coincidentally one of the first PC games I played). I loved Martian Memorandum, Under a Killing Moon, Pandora's Directive and Overseer. They all drew me in with their story line. This one does NOT disappoint. The narrative pathing (i.e., different endings based on decisions you make in the game) are great. The game play is fun, but if you hate puzzles, I recommend the Casual Gamer mode so you can skip the puzzles if you want. And there are quite a few brain-teasing puzzles. Thankfully, the only one I got stuck on (a sliding puzzle) was not mandatory to complete the game.My only real complaint is that you can go entire hours without having a situation where you can die, so you're constantly moving around and clicking on stuff without fear. Then all of a sudden, there's something that can kill you and you walk right up to it without the game making you aware (you have to actually click on it for the game to tell you that it can kill you). This only matters if you care about reaching the highest award the game offers as a Detective. Other than that, you can die as many times without repercussion.Pros:-Great story line, must see/play!-Puzzles can be funCons:-Can get frustrating trying to solve a puzzle (I recommend Googling a guide if you get stuck)-Can get frustrating trying to find a missing object (again, Google a guide if you get stuck)-Some of the puzzles are so complicated that you need to Google just how to complete them (Auxiliary Power reactor puzzle was one of them I did not understand how to work)-Can die without notice.-Not much replay value. Once you complete it, you can check out the other endings on YouTube."

The story is pretty good too, and the acting seems to have improved.  It's is based on an old Tex Murphy novel that begins right at the end of Overseer.  To explain the plot would be to give away the small twist thats right at the beginning of the story.  Suffice to say, the mythology is based on Tesla's work.Unfortunately they also brought back the scavenger hunts from the old games that really make it not so fun to play.  When you finally give in the towel on a puzzle and look up the solution, only to find you missed something laying under a newspaper that was supposed to look like a wheel, behind a building with absolutely no hint that it was there, it makes the game not so much fun.  Now you realize you have to scan every single inch of every single location to make sure you haven't missed any inventory items.Even with the magic flash light that makes things you can interact with sparkle, it's only slightly more bearable.  Primarily because the sparkles don't show up very well in the flashlights beam.Also there are some puzzles in the form of simple brain teasers that seemed very out of place and lazily thrown in just to have a game with more puzzles.  Today's games have puzzles that are organic to the story.  Tex Murphy still lives in a world where people throw in Magic 15 puzzles to lock doors.So if you liked the old Tex Murphy games, I would recommend this.  Just make sure you play on casual so you can use the hint system and even then, you might want to keep a walkthrough handy."

Tesla Effect carries the same spirit and feel as the rest of the Tex series. It’s like no time has passed. All the awful goofy jokes are all there and Tex is as Tex as Tex can get. Seeing Chandler Ave in hi-res modern graphics made me deliriously happy and all the references to past games are enough to make a long time fan of the games tear up a little. Even the new characters to the series are a joy to interact with and get to know (and having Kevin Murphy in your pocket is absolutely AMAZING). There were one or two gory moments and some rather dark elements, I didn’t mind but they were a bit jarring when brought about. I’ve been a fan of the series for about 7 years and I’m very happy with this addition to the series."

I did not back this during the kickstarter campaign, but if there's ever going to be a new kickstarter for another Tex Murphy game, I will be amongst the first to back it. I want more.The only minor faults that I could find is that the 3D part of the game could have been a bit more optimized. But this not something that bothered me much, because once I got into the game and the story, I quickly appreciated the game for what it is.If you like point and click / adventure (first person) games, and have a thing for detective (tv shows/stories) then you should not miss out on this one.

I adored Under a Killing Moon when I was younger, and this game is a wonderful update to that formula.Don't like the 'FMV' tag fool you; this game is NOT a ""click to watch the movies play"" game.  The cutscenes are FMV, as are the conversations, but the vast majority of the game is an adventure game.  You walk around the world and explore, talking to people, collecting items, and solving puzzles.I've missed really good games like this so much.  There's a few modern series that do the adventure game well (like the Blackwell games), but there's something MISSING from those games that Tex Murphy has.  I'm absolutely not saying they're bad, not at all, but this is something greater.  Something I've been missing for years.The game does have nostalgia value, but it stands on its own very well.  The environments look nice and there's plenty to explore.  The acting is a bit goofy and corny, but that's part of the fun.   Tex is supposed to be a ""lovable moron.""  The plot is serious, but the setting lapses into silliness at times, and I love that.Highly recommended to anyone who likes adventure games.Note: I recommend playing on ""gamer"" mode, so that you don't get magic sparkles around plot items.

It is certainly not the main attraction of the game, and one gets the feeling it only serves as background to somehow tie together Tex Murphy's quirky detective antics.

I stumbled onto it because I was looking for a retro type FMV game after enjoying a game called ""Her Story"". This did not disappoint. The FMV scenes are laughably bad (in a good way) and playing a 1940's style private detective fits perfectly with the cheesy acting and dialogue. While the game has a retro feel, it also has many modern conveniences such as: being able to instantly skip puzzles that are too difficult or convoluted and being able to teleport directly to key locations. While some of the puzzles were difficult, I never felt like they were unfair or too random. Anytime that I skipped a puzzle, I always had a ""Oh sh*t, I should have thought of that "" moment.

It has maybe too many inside references to the earlier ones which do have a certain nostalgia value to the old timers, but might be considered more than little odd and not explanatory enough to new players. Puzzles are ok, but nothing out of the ordinary. There was one towards the end that I personally found really frustrating and had to cheese through. Partly because the overall mood in the game had changed too much from detective tale into a horror-ish stuff with sudden deaths and insta-kills and I just didn't have the endurance to click through multiple random button changes. Most usable items in game are easy enough to find and you don't have to quess much how to use them. Also your inventory is never crammed up which is a good thing.I think I finished the game with the basic good ending(hero saves world, gets the girl)which felt ok but without any special feelings toward the characters or the plot itself.TL;DR: Overall a good classic style adventure game with real (bad and campy) actors, which works as a big plus to the game itself :)Here's to hoping to see more of Tex Murphy adventures and with more detective work specific puzzles, not just basic ""button switching and slide puzzles""."

I have played each Tex Murphy game as they came out starting with Meanstreets and I was thrilled to find out that Tex and crew was back in the Tesla Effect. The game did not disappoint. In two words, it was cinematic Tex.The video quality was excellent with highly detailed FMV that looked great on a big screen. The sound and music were excellent, The acting carried the story and humour along well with the varied characters convincing in their roles with only a couple of missteps. Although they don't reach Crysis levels of reality, the 3D environments were detailed, varied and atmospheric. The interface was clean, elegant and easy to navigate. Through all of it there was the great mix of humour and depth. Tex wants to find out what happened and he does it only as Tex can: sticking his fingers where they shouldn't go, always making a wry quip, and in the end doing the right thing with a little bit of luck, heart and battered thick-headed determination.The only drawbacks for me were the usual problems for an adventure game: occasionally spending an excess of time searching for a small clue in all the detail and some puzzles which are only very loosely tied to the story. That and the flow-breaking vagueness of the dialogue choices titles.  But for all the rest, the puzzles are finding and assembling the clues to tell the story, which is as it should be.I'm into the game for the story and the fun of it, so I played in casual mode and took my time to explore eveything I could. In honour of it being a new chapter in Tex's life, although I wanted to stay true to Chelsea, on my first run through, I thought Tex deserved to make the most of what his circumstances had granted him, and went with Taylor.

The campy vibe throughout the game is great, and the writing is just earnest enough about how cheesy the plot is to make the experience extremely entertaining. There are plenty of jokes, and they're pretty good.On the design front, I have to admit I think about 20% of the puzzles I've encountered so far (I'm about 2/3 of the way through the game, I think) have been sorta weak. I've had to collect 7 objects by hunting around the game's environments to unlock a door 3 times now, and have discovered how much more annoying pixel hunting can be if you're doing it in a 3D space.All that said, Tex Murphy is definitely the most fun I've had with an adventure game in recent memory. Play it!EDIT: After now having finished the game, I have to admit that the puzzles don't really get all that much better. It's still well worth the price that I paid, but it could've definitely done with a few more months of polish."

This game is in the spirit of all of the Tex Murphy games, especially the final 3, but updated with 21st Century technology. It's amazing what you get for $20 (that's release date price!)There are over 5 hours of cinematography (green screen, real actors), packed full of punch lines while still telling a serious, complex story. For the puzzle-lovers, there is plenty of that in here as well. If you hate puzzles, you can go on Casual mode which allows you to skip them for a lower score.This game also has replayability. Periodically, you are prompted to choose one of 3 dialog options. Over time, your dialog options have an effect on the game and cinematics. There are 3 different game paths, and 5 different endings.The cinematography with the actors is the highest quality I have ever seen--movie or game. You can clearly see someone as it would look if they were looking at you face-to-face, it is that detailed. They used double HD resolution (HD is 1080p; they used 2160p). That said, the game should run on a moderate-end system -- there are graphics settings you can tweak if needed.If you get stuck (on Casual mode), an in-game help system is available, again at the cost of a lower score. If you don't want to be tempted by hints and wish to go hard-core, you can choose to play on Gamer mode, though!It is not necessary to have played other games in the series. There are throw-back references (and some throw-back videos cleverly presented as flashbacks), but you can follow the story well if you just ignore those. That said, if you do decide you want to explore the rest of the series, they are available on GoG.The only mildly disappointing thing is that some of the rendered environments (when not in the cinematography) are a bit worse than typical games these days. This is to be expected for a kickstarter game with a budget of well under $1 million and only a few people to devote to graphics, and it certainly looks like it's 21st century technology, just that it's about 5 years old. But it's easy to forgive that considering the cinematography, story, multiple paths, and price of only $20.This game is my easiest recommendation of a new game to give -- the value for the dollar is higher than I've seen in a new release in a long time. Thumbs up without any reservations! Why are you still reading this review? You should have already bought it and be firing up the game!"

Having never played a Tex Murphy game prior to this had zero impact on the enjoyment level of this. What needed to be explained was explained and even silly things from the previous games (ala video) was sprinkled in from time to time. My only gripes are minor ones: ladders are strangely slow to operate and sometimes things are overly hidden.If you enjoy a good mystery/adveture game, and can appreciate the silliness of a sarcastic, noir detective living in a future with holograms, mutants, and flying cars, this is for you.

This one is set 7yrs after the events of Overseer and Tex has lost his memory after some shady events went down at his apartment block. Now he has to get his memory back and find his girlfriend Chelsee which ends up drawing him into the world of Nicola Tesla and his disciples.After playing the original Tex games back in the 90s it was amazing to play this game and it doesn't disapoint for old fans. All the old characters are there and being back on Chandler Ave is like coming home. Not much has changed since those previous games. You still move around the world in a first person view, clicking on things, picking up objects, solving puzzles and questioning characters. When you trigger a cut scene or talk to a character the 3D world switches to FMV footage. This technique was all the rage for awhile back in the 90s but hasn't really been used since then until now. The team at Big Finish have done a really good job with the quality of the FMV here. It's hi-def, the acting is pretty good (in a Tex way) and it fits pretty seamlessly into the rest. As with all the prior Tex games the humour is a big part and it's still here. Gotta love those eye rolling Tex jokes.The story is not bad, puzzles are pretty decent and gameplay is pretty easy to get a handle on. There were a couple of times in later sections of the game I found myself wandering around for ages trying to work out what to do next but I was playing on Gamer difficultly with no hints or guides. Luckily they also have a hint system and a Casual difficulty which will highlight objects if you get stuck.I've played this one through twice now and really enjoyed it. There is a team also working on remaking Overseer (the game that is a prequel to this one). Check out the site.www.thepoisonedpawn.comWill be looking forward to playing that one to."

The last game ended on something of a cliff hanger so it was a long wait to find out what happened.The game is a real throwback to the days when FMV was considered the future, and we all saw how that turned out. Even at the time though the Tex Murphy games stood out for having way better than average stories and really solid adventure game puzzling.Tex is basically your stereotypical hard boiled detective straight out of a 1940's detective film, only living in a futuristic dystopia version of San Francisco, complete with flying cars and hideous mutants. Part of the reason that the old games succeeded so well was that the actors revelled in hamming up their roles and chewing the scenery. The games for the most part, don't take themselves too seriously and there is plenty of humour. That said, Tex himself is a likeable guy and he ends up in pretty dark situations that despite their over the top nature, you actually care about the outcome of, simply because Tex is such a fun lead character.The game itself is very solid, in between FMV scenes where you will converse with characters in the usual ""pick a menu option for what you want to say"" style, you wander around in a 3D world, finding clues, looking for items and solving puzzles. The FMV is as fun and campy as ever, though your mileage may vary. The actual 3D itself looks pretty dated, with low poly count models and so so textures. It does the job though and the plot and puzzles carry it.If you are a fan of the originals you probably already own this, if not you should definitely pick it up as it captures the spirit of the originals. I still don't think its as great as my favourite entry, The Pandora Directive, its still a welcome return of a beloved character.If you aren't a fan, this is a solid puzzle based adventure game. Watch one of the trailers to see whether you are going to like the FMV bits or not, but honestly, the grow on you.Recommended 7.5/10Edit: Oh, I got the really sucky ending somehow. I ended up having to watch the good ending online."

Yes, I got it on sale, but it would still be very much worth your dollar at full price. I was introduced to the franchise a few years ago courtesy ofGOG.com. Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon got me stoked for the franchise and may be the ideal place to start.This is a very thoughtful, fully-realized game world where I want to spend time. The main reason is Chris Jones' stellar sense of humor, and his interactions with other cast members.The game play is point-and-click, and there are puzzles with various levels of difficulty. I was pretty pleased with myself for figuring out the one where you have to activate the six power points. Nice little thrill there, after experiencing a a few minutes of despair looking at a seemingly-unsolvable puzzle. The only puzzle I skipped was the slidey puzzle over the fireplace. I guess it was late and I didn't feel like exerting my brain much. The hint system here is simplified. I kind of liked the old hints/points system better, but that's a fairly minor nit to pick.There is a good deal of exploring to do as well. I had more than a little bit of trepidation willfully walking into a big maze, following some kind of giant spider. But I was rewarded for my bravery (after dying a few times).It was a treat to see Todd Bridges from Diff'rent Strokes in here (and now I'm showing my age). Also, June freaking Lockhart. There are a bunch of great character actors that will have you thinking, there's a familiar face. It was fun to look at the cast on IMDB. My favorite character beside Tex would have to be the mutant Louie Lamintz, who in real life is a lawyer practicing in Utah! Brilliant, just brilliant. Really enjoyed the acting bits. The only one that somehow seemed a bit wooden was Holly, but hey, she's a hologram, what do you expect? And I don't want to hear from you hologram activists!The ""paths"" hinge on your romantic interests. I haven't seen all the endings. I elected to stay true to Chelsee the first time through. Anyway, some of those scenes are a touch cheesy, not necessarily in a bad way, but I always kind of got a kick out of Tex getting rebuffed at every turn in the previous games. He seems to have somewhat better luck here, although it's sort of important to the story. And there is a double-slap moment that's pretty good. So I'm more than satisfied with this aspect.If you're on board with the idea of detective noir satire, this is pretty much the pinnacle of the genre. I'm not sure of anything else that qualifies as such. You will have fun, which some of us think is what video games should be about."

When Mean Streets and Martian Memorandum were made they were using the built in motherboard speaker to create speech in the game.Pandora was my favorite until Tesla Effect.

I got it on sale for $4, and it was certainly worth it for that price. However, I wouldn't buy it for $20 unless you are a Tex Murphy fan.The good:The live action videos were actually pretty well done, and the story was better than I expected. The environment looks pretty good, and Tex makes subtle jokes all time when you click on various things. There are also random puzzles scattered around that must be completed to unlock containers or doors. These puzzles don't really fit the story, but I enjoyed them nonetheless.The bad:The gameplay eventually becomes burdensome, and I just wanted to get to the next part of the story. For a while wandering around and looking for clues was interesting, but eventually it becomes so annoying walking back and forth to pick up this, activate that, pickup this, bring it over there, etc. I guess that sort of thing can be considered a puzzle, but it is like a puzzle where upon figuring out what to try next, you have to walk for 2 minutes to the proper location to try it (and sometimes avoid obstacles like landmines). Basically too much of the game is spent walking around, wasting the player's time.I would like to see the other endings, but I am afraid it will take too much time to see them.

On the other hand... its a FMV adventure, packed with some of the same issues it used to have back then, and a few new ones packed in. Yes, we still have some amateurish acting in here. Yes, we still have bad looking rendered backgrounds that don't mesh too well with the characters. And we also have another issue here: after 16 years, the actors aren't exactly at their prome. Hell, one of the main characters looks so old (and fatter) compared to his/her last game that it kinda ruined some scenes in the game. And that's one of the main issues with the FMV genre...As an adventure game, Its a great entry. It does have a few casual puzzles (you know, the ones you usually find in hidden object games - sliding, jigsaw, etc), but there are also some amazingly designed ones, and the detective stuf is till top notch. You can open every drawer, you can look at every corner of the maps, you can still click in everything just to hear Tex cracking some jokes... Fact is: even if the game is indeed flawed, its easy to forget about the issues when you have a game that delivers EXACTLY what the fans where looking for: an answer to the question that has been living on our brains ever since we saw the end of Overseer. And unlike most recent adventure games, you DO have a nice inventory management, including the ability to combine items. Yeah, like the classics. ^^Much like Pandora Directive, Tesla Effect features two things that are usually NOT found in FMV games: branching dialogue trees and multiple endings. This is nice, because it gives you a reason to replay the game. The story will be the same, but you'll be able to see different dialogues, different scenes and different endings (there are 5 of them, BTW). The story, BTW, is, in my opinion, amazing. Very complex, very detailed and very creative. It VERY fictional, but not absurd. While it continues from the cliffhanger ending presented in Overseer, it also features a new plot, involving Nikola Tesla's inventions and some urban legends around it. In fact, the connections between all the older games and this new plot are so natural that you REALLY have to congratulate Chris Jones for its amazing writing.The gameplay is actually quite good. You still are able to navigate full 3D backgrounds in first person view, but all dialogues and most actions are presented in FMV scenes with branching  dialogues. You don't really choose WHAT Tex is gonna say, but HOW he will deliver his next line (sarcastic retort, weird PI humor, change subject, etc). This is nice, since you never know what he is gonna say until he does. This game has two difficulty settings, but unlike the older games, you have can select between casual, which is VERY easy, and gamer, which is just ""normal"". Yeah, this game doesn't present too much challenge for classic adventure players. But it's still harder than most adventure games coming out nowdays, and still feels like a real game, not an interactive movie, which is nice.The graphics are ok. For some lame reason, they decided to use Unity (YUCK!), so expect unstable framerates, VERY low res textures and weird 3D models. But the game doesn't really look BAD. Hell, for a budget game, some places are actually quite pleasing to the eyes. The FMV scenes are fantastic though. Not only they are in a very high resolution (blu-ray quality!), but most of them are quite well produced (the ending scenes specially have amazing special effects!). The sound department is perfect. The sound effects are realistic and VERY atmospheric and the musics are great and always set the right mood to most scenes. I have nothing to complain about the soundtrack. Heck, they even put the UAKM day transition song in here!! :pAnyway... Tesla Effect isn't perfect. It doesn't poop on Tex Murphy's name, and actually make it even stronger. In fact, its a better game that most people expected, and considering how dead the FMV genre is, its amazing that we got a new game that feels so similar to the older ones. It's a game that REALLY delivers to fans of the series. If you are not a fan though... well, I recommend that you try the demo first, because this game is aimed at the fans.I give this game an 9/10. And I REALLY hope they do a new one in the near future. At least before the actors get even older. :p"

,Recommended,261510,15187637,"Posted: 3 April, 2015",all,TheMilkman99,"Tesla Effect is a love letter to the old FMV genre that stands on its own merits as a modern title. You play as a bumbling cybernoir detective named Tex Murphy in this reboot of a series that had its last installment in 1998. This game was crowdfunded by fans so newcomers (like myself) can feel a little lost but the story opens with Tex losing his memory of the last seven years which can help ease you in to the universe.The gameplay is fairly simple. Full motion video cutscenes are separated by 3D envrionments that you must explore to find clues and solve puzzles in order to progress. The puzzles are not very difficult and you'll find most of the challenge comes from finding small items hidden in obscure locations. These scenes are made more lively with Tex's commentary as you observe different items in the games world. Depending on how observant and you are and your profficency for puzzle-sloving this game will vary from around 8 to 16 hours. I took just shy of 14 hours to complete my first playthrough and the only other FMV title I have played is the old X-Files game.The real charm from this game comes from its characters and acting. It feels like watching a cheesy B-Movie in the best way possible. There are some real gems of good delivery to be found complemented by awkward lines that will make you grin. Tex himself is absolutely lovable and you will meet several genuinely interesting people along the way. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and focuses on being as enjoyable as possible.Overall it's a well-executed modern interpretation of the old FMV adventure games and I am so glad I picked it up. If you are on the fence watch the ""OMG FMV GOTY"" trailer (it should be the first video on the store page). It sold me on buying this in under four minutes and I haven't looked back since."

The 3D graphics might not be the latest and greatest, but that doesn't matter -at all-. You get sucked in and forget about it really fast.There were some moments of the game that I really didn't like. Some levels or puzzles requires that you are quick and has good coordination. Not what I expect from any adventure game. If I wanted that I'd play shooters or something.This game is very heavy on puzzles and while most are pretty well balanced others are down right evil.

,Recommended,261510,10079083,"Posted: 10 May, 2014",all,Matt,"Having played the game from start to finish with just work and sleep in the way, it's safe to say I really enjoyed it.  Is it for everyone?  Absolutely not.  Is there things I did not like - absolutely.  The game is very archaic in everything outside of its cutscenes and dialogue.  The game relies on almost 3D-like pixel hunting to find items in the inventory.  I cannot tell you how many times I was stuck because I couldnt find an item that was hidden or under a table or in a dark corner.  The puzzles rage from borderline  easy to incredibly obtuse/time consuming.  Most of it results in trial and error.  Some puzzles dont have solutions when you think there would be.  When you get stuck, especially on Gamer mode when there is no hint, expect to take a few dozen minutes to hours to find that random item you need to complete a puzzle.The game also includes something which I found very distracting/annoying - a computer companion named (Smart) Alex.  I understand why he's in the game as hes pretty much the only one you have with you at all times and gives the game needed exposition from time to time.  However for the most part I found his prescense annoying, he detracted from the immersion.  This is however a minor detail, or nitpick.The gameworld is pretty hollow, or empty.  Mean Streets is the same you remember, almost too similar.  You cant explore stores anymore and the characters you talk to from previous games seem to be just there to forward the plot.  Its pretty remarkable to get most if not all of the original cast back but none of them actually do anything for the plot other than forward it to the next scene.  Probably a smaller game world next time will make the game feel less barren.  Currently you're feel like you're on rails - going from one plot point to another until you're in a completely different location and doing the same thing but this time trying to find items to complete puzzles.I have played all the 3D Tex Murphy games, although this game is excellent I personally feel Pandora Directive is better but only because of the game world.  As previously mentioned, where this game excells is the video quality and quantity.  There is a staggering amount of detail in the game world.  It is unfortunetely however how convuleted the plot is at times - how the characters will reference or drop information as it was already common knowledge.  There are several times when they will say something critical or profound and just say, ""Oh I'm sure you know this already Tex.""  I dont know if this is intentional as the basic plot deals with Tex losing his memory, or because the plot branches so much but its very jarring.  It creates a disconnect with the plot and in the end I had no idea what was going on, or probably as much as Tex did.  Maybe it would be different on a different path?I would recommend this game first to previous players of Tex Murphy games - it will be interesting to see if multiple playthroughs make the plot more coherent.  Also due to the branching paths it will be interesting if theres different areas or puzzles that open up with it as well.  If you're new to Tex Murphy or even old school pixel hunt adventure games I'd try the demo first.  If I could give this game a score, it would be a 7 out of 10."

Tex really needs no intro. Prior to starting the game I feared there was going to be too many references that were inside jokes from previous chapters of the Tex Murphy saga. Im glad to say that this stands alone well and everyone can get the same level of enjoyment whether they were very involved with previous storylines or are a total newcomer like myself.Easily a 4.5 out 5 stars. The half star deduction will be explained later. But its nothing that should stop you from getting the game."

While I never even heard of Tex Murphy prior to this game, it does make me want to go back and play the older ones. The FMVs are the great, using the advances of the past several years. The 3d graphics are notably dated, reminding me of early 2000 games. But we arent here for the graphics, it would be like playing CoD for the story. The story is excellent, given its goofy/campy nature (which I feel makes it even better, too many games these days try to make themselves to be more serious and profound that they really are). The plot is something right out of the 90s-00s cyperpunk genre. I could rattle on and on about this game, but I wont. So Ill just give it a good thumbs up. If you like cyberpunk, film noir, have about of nostalgia for 90s-00s games and/or point/click adventures. This is a good buy for you."

If you haven't played any of the old games, you probably won't like this one, unless you are a fan of the puzzle adventure genre. If you have played the old games you will not be disappointed. This is a classic Tex Murphy adventure with all the old humor and even the odd flash back to moments from the old games. The acting is pretty average and yes you can see actors occassionally reading from the cue cards, but that's just how all Tex games are and I wouldn't have it any other way! The use of the Unity engine breathes new life into the world although some areas appear to have been rushed and a lot of textures are below par for what I would expect from todays games. On the other hand the full motion HD video is top-notch, a massive leap forward over the older games. It could have been easy for these guys to change the formula and go down a more open-world route with this game but they've stuck to the old formula well and it's a credit to them, it works and provides a nice bit of nastalgia. I got about 11 hours of play out of it, and thats just the first path I haven't replayed the different paths yet. So for $20 it's great value classic puzzle advernturing."

The only others I'd really seen were the phantasmagoria games and the handful of Wing-commander games in the same format, which were kinda like interactive movies.This game is no different, but it was cool to see a dead genre reborn. The game was definately one for the fans, and you can tell a lot more work went into the FMV sequences rather than the game-play itself. The acting is very cheesy a lot of the time, just like most FMV games. For example, in at least two scenes, actors were supposed to be dead, but you could see them still breathing.The puzzles in the game were pretty basic and the puzzle difficulty ranged tremendously throughout the game. Sometimes I had to use brute force to pass a puzzle, other times I managed to solve them very quickly.With all this said, I still really liked the game and would happily buy and play a sequel.

Now, fair warning, this is a point-and-click adventure game, so if you do not like that type of game, then you probably won't love it the way I do. However, if you do like that genre, this is a wonderful game for you. If you played any or all of the Tex Murphy games from about ten years ago--Under a Killing Moon, The Pandora Directive--then you are in for a double treat. Many of your favorite characters are back, and Tex is played by the same actor with all the wisecracking and corny P.I. jokes (of course). One of the things I got the biggest kick from is the flashback sequences drawn from the old games triggered by objects in the environment (remembering how Tex got a hole in the brim of one of his fedoras was one of my favorites). The flashbacks appear to be the FMV from the old games displayed in a little letterbox in the center of the screen. The new FMV shot for this game is high-def and full screen and looks and plays beautifully. There is a casual mode for beginners with hints as to what to do next and objects that are needed for the story highlighted by Tex's trusty flashlight. More experienced adventure gamers are going to want to play without the hints or the object-highlighting, but either way this is a great ride--especially if you played any of the earlier games. I played without the help, and while there are a few items that took a bit of work to find and a challenging timed puzzle at the end of the game, I only had to rely on the Universal Hint System two or three times.So a great point-and-click adventure for anyone, and a special treat for Tex Murphy fans from earlier games, Tesla Effect is not to be missed."

They seems to have spent most of the money on the Full Motion Video cutscenes, voice acting, and music, thus the rest of the game is not up to modern standards. If you are a fan of point and clicks that have more puzzles and exploration than other games, like Telltale's Walking Dead, which emphasizes more on being an interactive movie, you will love this game.Edit: I forgot to mention that the game itself is quite lengthy compared to modern point and clicks.

They were very much on my radar and I remember quite well wanting to play Under a Kiling Moon when I was young.  FMV games for the most part were a flash in the pan fad that really overstayed their welcome in the early/mid 90's.  Some did it very well and are among my favorite adventures (Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within,) some were flawed but still highly enjoyable (Phantasmagoria) and some were pretty abysmal (anything released on Sega CD.)  Tesla Effect falls promptly into the middle catagory.The story, characters, presentation and FMV are pretty fantastic.  The acting is terrible but in the best possible way.  Any positive things I have to say about this game all center around those aspects.  The game environment and gameplay on the other hand did leave quite a bit to be desired.The world itself is pretty ugly by todays standards.  It was like navigating a 1999 poly environment.  I guess you could argue that works for the game since it's a return to a medium long dead since the 90's. The gameplay relies HEAVILY on finding items as every adventure games should.  The real trouble here is that the items and world are so murky and blocky that they blend together.  I highly recommend playing on ""casual"" settting because your flashlight will call sparkly attention to these things.  Even then it was still difficult finding them.I feel bad for complaining about this game because it has so much character.  I just wish more time and effort were put into the gameplay.   Also I hugely enjoyed the easter eggs that pulled video from the original Tex adventures.  They really made me want to go back and see what I was missing.  Sadly they were missing from the final half of the game or I was just missing them.Still a recommended play for anyone looking for a nostalgic trip back to 90's FMV"

The graphics is greatly improved, and it still got left the same feeling as back in the days. As an adventure game, is still works. But in many ways it could still have improved, the first thing that comes to mind is that the puzzles in the game is all very easy is mostly just clicking and you will get it right within a minute or two. I would have wanted more locations, and possibilty to visit them when they were unlocked, now it becomes very cinematic focused, and the story is so easy to progress throu because they nearly always tell you what to do and how to do it. The real detective feeling and the feeling of what am I suppost to do, dosen´t exist as in the other games.  Now if your lost it´s just a matter of finding the iteam they tell you that you need. For the nostalagic feeling and because of that these games isn´t made today it´s worth playing, but it goes very quick and all to easy."

Tex needs the hollywood Budget... it's too big a game to pass off for less than a few mill... What they've done is amazing... The FMV's are truely great. Interviewing people for clues is well done... but it needs to be bigger... There should be 3-4 Cases for Tex to be solving... I hope Modding crews get onto it... could be done (Although FMV's wont be usable... maybe freeze frames of the actors?)The low budget shows in the Graphics... although it's not too bad if you played the originals newbies will wtf at the seemingly dated graphics... most painful if you get a glimpse of an NPC. I do understand that the effort was put into the FMV's and storyline. Maybe TM7 will get the publisher backing it needs. The road Tex lives on has been brought to life... it does look good... it's not next gen graphics... certainly does the trick... but it's not as good as it should be for the wonderous game it is.Few other nitpicks about items generally being small and you have to painstakingly examine rooms inch by inch (Certainly on the harder mode where you don't have the flashlight and *Sparkle* effect on items of interest)But it is a long game... first playthough took around 20 hours on hard. Like I say finding items can be a task. But certainly a great deal longer than the 8 hours on the recent COD game... there are also multiple endings and multiple chat paths which is nice.Can't help but think if a couple of mill had been thrown at the game for a decent graphical engine we'd be looking at a Game Of The Year easily. It's all well and good for those who loved the originals and wish to find out what happened to Tex and is a nice bit of closure on one of Gamings underdogs. But it needs more... I hope someone out there reognises this is a niche market that does have a fanbase... there are plenty of mature gmaers who'd eat this up... also there are a whole hoard of younger gamers sick of the 'run here, shoot that, run here, shoot that' games that are released daily.

Also, a guy jumped to his death in front of Tex's eyes, right before Tex was propositioned by two entirely separate ladies.In other words, this game put a smile on my face.  If you love stories and characters at all--and don't mind a presentation that at times can feel a little ""stripped down"" (but charmingly so)--then I can guarantee you'll enjoy this game.  The light humor and noir atmosphere certainly don't hurt either.If you're wondering if you have to already be familiar with the Tex Murphy games to enjoy this, the answer is no.  Take it from me, as I've never played any of them before this one.  In fact, I only have a vague knowledge of what they even were based on hearing them being mentioned so many times on adventure game forums.  (I also once downloaded and listened to the humorous ""Tex Murphy Radio theater"" based on these characters.)I was aware of the Kickstarter campaign that got this game made, however.  And I find it miraculous that for such a low budget, they were able to produce this polished an experience.  (The team must be friends with a lot of people in the industry.)  No, it does not look like a ""real"" movie.  It's not quite that cinematic.  But coming from someone whose previous experiences with FMV (Full Motion Video) games included Gabriel Knight 2 and Phantasmagoria, this has to be just about the most polished FMV game ever made.  This may be damning with faint praise, but you can easily find clips and stills of the game in action on the net and decide for yourself if the ""FMV"" look is something you can enjoy.Special mention has to be made about the music though.  I said before that the look of the game wasn't quite on par with a ""real"" movie.  Well, the same can't be said for the music.  It's fantastic, and would easily fit in with any high-budget mainstream film.I do also want to make special note of the acting.  I see some people have called it ""cheesy"" or bad.  I could not disagree more.  Most everyone in the cast is very good, and any ""cheesiness"" seems to be ithrough intentional over the top hamming it up--all in good fun.  I think if at times it comes off as a bit amateur it is through no fault of the actors themselves.  Basically, this was shot in a very ""matter of fact"" way with HD cameras that don't entirely convey a purely cinematic look.  Add to that, for the ""interrogation scenes"" the actors have been instructed to stand dead center in front of the camera and looking directly into the lens the entire time.  It's really hard to come across as natural under such circumstances.  The fact that they largely manage to do so is a credit to them.Anyway, if you're a fan of the adventure genre--specifically because you're a fan of story and character--then you should give this a whirl.***I do have a few criticisms, though.  In no way do they make the game unworthy of purchase, but just know that they're there:  I wish that the streets you navigate through had been populated by some NPCs so as to create a more alive feel to the world.It should also be noted that the latter stages of the game are not as much fun as the first half.  Other reviews have mentioned the unfortunate presence of ""pixel hunting"" in this game.  While that's true, let me just clarify what that term means in Tesla Effect.  In the old days of adventure gaming, pixel hunting meant that one had to move their mouse all over the screen and click on just the right spot for the game to recognize they'd clicked on the correct object.  That's not quite what it means in the case of Tesla.There aren't truly any areas of the screen to confuse the player as to its ""clickability.""  Nor are there any objects so small that one can't precisely place their mouse over it.  (After all, when Tex turns his flashlight on, any such objects that tex needs to interact with immediately sparkle.)  What IS an issue however is that the latter half of the game is largely taken up with First-Person Doom like navigating around some real-time environments while Tex/you must find different objects, push buttons, etc.  I know most people wouldn't find such gameplay an issue.  In fact, first person, Blair Witch-like experiences are (unfortuantely) what most gamers have come to think of when you say ""video game"" to them.  For a lot of people, videogames are nothing BUT that.However, that's not the kind of experience I treasure in a game.  I enjoy games (particularly Adventure games) for the characters and story--elements that Tesla Effect has in spades at the beginning, but which gradually dissipate as the game goes on.  Unfortunately, as the player wanders around these vast, sterile 3D environments (the multi-floored ""Tesla Society"" building being the worst, in that it never ends), much of that sense of character and story is lost.  Yes, sometimes you'll hear Tex's voiceover comment on something when you encounter a locked door or whatever, but it's not enough to remove the sense that, yup, you're currently playing a game similar to 99% of games that people play these days.The cut-scenes and sense of story do return at the end, thankfully.  However, it's not until after the player has slogged their way through a lot of tedium."

I personally never played Tex Murphy games before, so I can't say if it's a good sequel or not. It has a detective mystery, jokes and some (mostly unoriginal) puzzles. What does feel both very familiar and, at the same time, very new, is the live actors and filmed cutscenes. You know, the games and movie makers strive for decades to make computer generated faces look realistic, and yet you can always learn to tell it's a fake. It's surprisingly refreshing to see actual live real human people talking to you from the screen. Even if their acting skills are not Oscar-winning :) And it's cool to watch pre-rendered cutscenes with flying cars and special effects. The clever way developers combine 3D world where you can walk around like in any FPS game, with full motion video dialogs and cutscenes, was also a pleasant surprise for me. The gameplay is mostly about dicovering pieces of the mystery through dialogs with real actors in full motion video, and walking around and finding hidden objects in full 3D. It's a good solid game, relaxing mostly, I'm enjoying it. And it makes me want to see the FMV genre developed further, with more games and more creative ideas on using real actors in a gaming environment.So, my personal opinion is that Tesla Effect is a nice game, but not a blockbuster; what it really deserves a big praise for, is showing that FMV gaming still has a potential. If you're a fan of adventure titles, you're most likely to enjoy it, but if you're just curious to know what FMV is like in 2014, I'd recommend waiting for a sale."

Adventure game with real 3D scenarios and, where all dialogs with characters and all cinematics are videos, like in a series B film.

Typical anti-hero detectivesque atmosphear but, full of humor, as well.Puzzles aren't mostly that hard and, usually easy to figure out (except very few). Things to do are so variate that you don't go easily bored.It takes a little while to understand games mechanics, since your character wakes up with no memories and, in a world where you can freely move. The tips come when you interact with characters and, your memory gaps start to be filled in.3D graphics aren't spectacular but, serve to the purpose.Voice acting is good and actors do a good job.Translation is a tad defective, at least, in Spanish.

Most of the puzzles are very cool and the game continues to move at a fairly quick pace. But be sure to search and click on everything you can find because there are several little gems to be found that are absolutely hilarious.When the game ended, there was alot of hope that this would not be the last, and I hope that is the case.

The UI could be better but both UI and character controls are much more convenient than in the previous games.The games from this series are entertaining in the same way as a good tongue-in-cheek B-movie. I think old fans that loved the previous installments for what they were are likely to enjoy this one. People expecting state-of-the-art graphics and movie-quality acting as given may be disappointed."

It's painfully embarrassing when the developers suddenly insert an entire Ancient Egypt section with puzzles like theriver crossing problemand probably think this is a great idea.Your role is always confined to abstract, low-level problem solving that hasnothingto do with the story itself. The story is neatly told through high quality FMV cutscenes while you are searching for screwdrivers, sausages and nose hair trimmers in low quality 3D environments.Tyrannosaurus Tex. It's one, huge dinosaur of a game with graphics from the early 2000s and gameplay from the early Pleistocene. LikeDuke Nukem Forever, this is a game that came out 15 years too late and, maybe, should have never been made in the first place."

There are some things the game does really well and some things that were disappointing.The look of the game was overall good the cg backgrounds only sometimes clashing with the actors in front of a green screen.  There were some cut scenes that I wish they actually had real sets.The acting was good with the exception of a few characters.Where I take issue with the game is in the story.  Tesla Effect seems to want to ride the rails between serious noir detective story and goofy comedic game which was to its detriment.  One minute Tex has a bad pun and the next there's people getting violently murdered and heavy sexual innuendo.  I would have much prefered the game if they picked one direction and stuck with it.The gameplay is in the very traditional adventure game style of: use x on y and combine x with z, so if you like that it's fine.The puzzles with one exception were well done (if not a little easy) with the exception of one which requires the player to know of an ancient egyptian puzzle from outside the game to know what the goal of the puzzle is.As a new player to the Tex Murphy series, I found the game to be geared too much towards old players.  Several Items are strewn about the game that if you click on them it plays a clip from an old game.  I think these were supposed to be funny parts from the originals, but without their context i didn't find them funny at all, just stange and confusing.If you are a fan of the series you probably will like it, but if like me you are an adventure gamer new to Tex you'll probably be unimpressed.  Maybe buy it on sale."

Having not played the previous games, I went into this completely blind, hoping to be amused by a fun point & click with some cool FMV. Instead I got incredibly cringe-worthy acting and a 2005 looking game. While I was playing I was constantly shown 'memories' from, what I can only assume, were previous games. None of them were particularly funny or engaging. On top of that was the influence from Kickstarter which was very noticeble with photographs of backers constantly being shoehorned in everywhere. The only redeeming factor (for me) was the VTMB vibe I was getting walking around the dark and moody map. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not a die hard fan of the series."

The further into the game you go you end up with entire rooms dedicated to finding one item.Catastrophic audio bugs throughout the game, couldn't hear Tex's speech most the time, settings sliders did nothing. Previous comments on this bug by other players only led to devs saying 'we don't get this issue and we can't do anything about it' which is rather atrocious.Not much of the game made sense but that may just be me.Should you play it?If you enjoy these kinds of games then it's worth playing other wise just avoid it."

I have never been so annoyed nor gotten as angry at a game in my life, and I've played all the Souls games, among other games that have a tendency to make you lose your cool at some point or another.Some puzzles I thought I had figured out the logic behind, but when solving it didn't work I resorted to trial and error until it worked, and I still don't know the logic behind those puzzles.  I've seen others complete them on Youtube, and it only confused me more when, in 1 instance in particular, they solved a puzzle by doing what I had done.. except for me it didn't work.Puzzle and point-and-click games aren't my favorite genres so if you're a big fan of those you may get a better experience, especially if you're a Tex Murphy fan.On the other hand, I enjoyed the FMVs.. good cheesy fun.  The intro movie was the best part of the game.. got me pumped to be immersed in a movie I'd play in as the main character.. and then I got plopped into the gameplay and I barfed in my mouth a little.TL:DR - Great B-movie, terrible game."

The areas are too big and you can spend a lot of time wandering around. It also keeps going back to some dated footage from the previous game. The odd clip might give some veterans of the series nostalgia but for me it's just anoying.  Given the ammount of money and hype around this game you'd expect it to be at least equal with some of the other adventure titles out there like technobabelon or gemini rue. Blah...

It succeeds at catering to an existing fanbase, but falls flat on its face when trying to be a modern point-and-click. It's not going to win any new hearts and minds.Almost all other PnC adventures released in the past 5-6 years as part of a revival of the genre outshine this game in every aspect. If Tesla Effect does anything well, it's showing that movies should remain movies and games should remain games. Good game design and artistic vision is more important than fanservice."

The same branching dialogues, the same silly puzzles that usually aren't difficult, and the same questionable logic which determines which random objects go together to make functional objects to solve problems.Pros:~ The 4K camera work looks great.  The quality of the FMV portions look fantastic.~ Cheezy dialogue and acting.  It's a YMMV thing, but I love it.~ For those who have followed Tex through his recent adventures in the Pandora Directive and the Tex Murphy Radio Saga, it attempts to tie up all the loose ends and explain what has all happened.  It's a pretty well written story.~ Multiple endings based on dialogue decisions, and while some are better than others, Sapphyre's is great.~ The game is legitimately funny.~ All digital, so NO DISC SWAPPING HALLELUJAH!~ Tons of references to the earlier games, especially Under a Killing Moon.Cons:~ The puzzles aren't really as difficult as you would think.  And the game follows a fairly predictable thread of 1.) Talk to people on the street 2.) Find items needed to get into a place  3.) Find items in place, and solve puzzles, 4.) Rinse, Lather, Repeat.~ The camera work is great, but the in game 3D world looks like it came right out of 2003, in a not good way.  The world is much more open than previous games, and there aren't the frequent, epic length loading screens, or disc swapping THANK GOD.~ If you didn't play the earlier Tex Murphy games, especially Overseer and Pandora Directive, it may be difficult to grasp the story.  Under A Killing Moon is suggested, because it's the best, but doesn't contribute as much to the story.Ultimately, if you're an oldschool Tex Murphy player, a fan of Point & Click games, interactive movies, or like comedies with a film noir setting, you may love this game.  If you're not into those, you could probably pass on it."
