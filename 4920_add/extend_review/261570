,Recommended,261570,14832426,"Posted: 10 March, 2015",all,Nubblecakes,"Truly one of the most gorgeous games ever.DISCLAIMER:- I bought this game on a whim after seeing it in the Steam Store for the first time. I watched the promotional videos and was immediately interested in it.- I love this game, therefore this reviewis biased. I am not some professional games journalist who makes a living off of reviewing games and tries to provide an objective and totally unbiased point of view on the subject material. If you were expecting such a review from the average Steam user, then your standards might be a bit high. No offense, high standards aren't really abad thing. My intention with this review is to convince others who might be interested in the game to take the leap and drop $20 on it. That's all.- At the time of this review, I only had about two hours of playtime invested. Overall the game isn't terribly complex, and the gameplay is what you'd expect from the average Metroidvania title (with more focus on platforming than combat). It's polished, the art is beautiful, and the story is engaging while not getting in the way of playing the game. After two hours, I felt that I could wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might show interest in it.REVIEW:If I had to briefly describe the game, I would say it's a very artistically-driven 2D platformer with common elements from both the Metroid and Castlevania series. But that merely scratches the surface.I won't go in to excruciating detail regarding the gameplay. It's a branching world with areas you can't access without certain abilities. You progress naturally until you unlock a new ability, then more options open up and you can progressively explore more freely. Naturally, the world is littered with hidden goodies like health and energy powerups (like energy tanks and missiles from Metroid). Platforming does become rather challenging, and the fact that the movement is very responsive and feels polished makes platforming a blast despite the difficulty. However, a certain ability you are given right from the start can detract from the challenge by essentially removing the consequences of dying.Combat is pretty simplistic (you basically just spam the attack button and it auto-locks to the nearest target), but it is clearly not the focal point of the gameplay. The majority of the abilities you unlock cater towards more efficient and complex platforming maneuvers. There is a simple experience system which rewards you with skill points that allow you to unlock an assortment of abilities that are split off in to three different skill trees. These abilities are either unique passives, or augment the main abilities that you acquire through progression in the game.As far as visuals go, this game is in my humble opinion at the very apex of gorgeous. The art style is surreal and brimming with color and personality. I'm not exaggerating when I say you could take a screenshot anywhere in the game and it would make for a great picture. There are certain areas in the game where you just have to stop and marvel at how downright beautiful the art is. Not many games these days are capable of that (the last one that comes to mind is probablyThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter). People might say that gameplay is all that matters, but this game is a prime example of why that's simplyjust not trueanymore. I believe that in regards to modern games, visuals will always play an important role in making the game what it is. Games are a from of art now, not just pure entertainment. Anyone who plays this game and says otherwise isprobablyinsane.The musical score is just as good as the visuals. There's heavy use of woodwind instruments and a touch of harmonic female vocals that really set the mood. There are overaching themes throughout the score that gives the whole soundtrack real cohesion. The best part is that the music doesn't overplay itself during cutscenes to create a sappy, melodramatic mood. During general gameplay, the music is calmer and more relaxed. In turn, it helps to keep the player feeling the same even during the tougher platforming areas.The story, while somewhat simple in nature, does a great job of presenting the game's gorgeous world and giving you a solid sense of pace. It's not a really big RPG story with tons of lore or anything, but you can stilleasilybe enveloped by its provocative and charming nature. The game can even be surprisingly emotional and deep when you least expect it. Think of the art as a painting and the story as a frame. The frame may be simplistic, but it just goes great with the painting.Moon Studios have made a strong debut with this game, and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us in the future. If you have the money to spare, I highly recommend you pick this up; or wait until the next big sales event and maybe you will find it for cheap. Either way, it's worth every penny."

And yet Ori stands on its own.Ori is intuitive; it's inventive; it's surprisingly challenging (I died over 200 times in the 10 hours it took me to complete it.) But damn, is it fun.Everything is seamless. And I mean everything. From the minimalist interface, to the controls, to the microsecond load time between dying and respawning - the latter of which you, like me, will come to know well. And equally well the fact that you can save, more or less, wherever you want.Power ups and ability trees keep things fresh, and like a good piece of Zelda equipment, every addition to your platforming repertoire opens up a whole new mechanic to the gameplay.The story is as flawless as the game. (And the opening is as memorable as the ending. Have ready a bucket for your tears.)Few action platformers have a decent story to accompany it. Ori is different. No, the game doesn’t play itself; it isn’t one of those. Rather, like a player to respawn points (see: this game), gameplay and narrative are intimately connected; character actions are justified, and power ups serve the story and the player. The result is that each accomplishment you make is both rewarding and intensely satisfying.I testify to what others have said: the game looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, plays beautifully. Everything about it is stunning. But don't be fooled: it's beautiful *and* hard. If you aren't a skilled platformer now, play Ori and the Blind Forest. You will be.10/10"

The art direction and animation are really tight and well executed, the controls are something to be envied and are incredibly well done, the music is captivating and remains in my head well after I've put the controller down...I am completely and utterly head over heels for this game.I look forward to exploring more in this game. The sense of accomplishment you feel from gaining a new ability to reach a part of the map that was previously unavailable is particularly satisfying. I wish I had more time for this amazing experience.I can't recommend this game enough. Anyone considering this game, don't consider. Just buy. Install. Play. You won't be sorry."

Well, Ori is one of those games.Even though perfection will never exist in videogames IMO, I find it really hard to search for cons into this game. Just notice that I was very hyped about Hotline Miami 2 for almost a year and I honestly admit that this hype banished once I purchased Ori.Ori and the Blind Forest brings something new, something fresh, something NEEDED. I can't imagine the amount of work required to build a game like this but trust me people, devs can be hugely proud of it.Visuals are the closest to perfection I've ever seen in a videogame. Just see it for yourselves and get stunned about what a 2D platformer can give you. Seriously, you don't need to go to an art museum anymore. This game is well enough. From beginning to end it'll be impossible for you not to stare at every single detail, every singe hand-made background.The tag ""Great Soundtrack"" is not one of the most voted without a reason. Such a great visuals strongly need a great soundtrack too, and that's what you'll find. Tracks add so much feeling and emotion into this game that together with the visuals it becomes one of the greatest combinations of the WHOLE industry.Controls are tight and super fair. Mind this words: the game is challenging and every single death will be of your fault. This is the regular metroidvania where you get more movement skills as soon as you progress into the story. I found quite some similarities to the experience I got with Guacamelee (in terms of gameplay).The story... OMG. Just when I thought I saw everything a 2D platformer could give (mostly soft and simple plots), this game appears. 20 minutes were enough for me to start clapping in front of the screen. This game has one of the strongest prologues I've ever played. AND IT'S IN 2D. SO MANY LIMITATIONS, YET SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EXECUTION.The length is also good enough. Not too long, but not too short either. Map is extremely well planned, together with collectibles and secrets. Getting everything can perfectly give you 8-10h, which is more than the average platformer can offer.Finally, achievements are very well written too. This sounds stupid but it's sad to see some nice games where the achievements are completely senseless or wrongly directed. This game has every kind of achievement I like: storyline achievements, collectible achievements, movement achievements, and hardcore achievements.I think that the only con I can find to this game is that sometimes there are so many glowing things together that you can't really distinguish the friendly ones against the enemy bullets. But this mainly applies to one particular enemy and I'm partially colorblind so I can't say it's a con at all.Overall, just stop buying mediocre bundles nor triple A games. Do yourself a favor and pay 20€ for this game. We're in front of one of the best games of the year, and we're still on March. But seriously, this game is something I've never seen before (and I've played more games than I can count) and probably no one will dislike this game (aside from fake haters and people pretending to be funny).Final Mark: 9.75/10 this is one of the best 2D platformers you'll play in a very long time."

,Recommended,261570,15178347,"Posted: 2 April, 2015",all,Yossarian,"I very, very rarely review games, so I'm doing this out of sheer respect and thankfulness for the developer, Moon Studios.Ori is easilyone of the best gamesI have bought on a whim (in 8 years of Steam), and had I had any idea of that... well, it wouldn't have been on a whim. The art is probably what stands out the most, but that's only because the controls are so well implemented, they never really took me out of this immersive - and touching - story. Not for a second, honestly.It was sufficiently challenging for me as a seasoned gamer, but I'm more than sure it shouldn't be frustrating for any casual gamer who doesn't possess a really, really short temper. In fact,I cannot think of another game that made me care so little about dyingand having to repeat the same difficult scenes. To the opposite: I was so excited by them (in no small part thanks to the amazing soundtrack and artwork that surely accompanied), that I sometimes died on purpose at the end of a tough part to try to play it again more perfectly. I feel like this is a really big deal and I hope you believe me.I can honestly think of only one con: you cannot (as of yet at least) continue playing your save after you finish the game. I wish I had known this before, because I truly wanted to go back and finish it 100% - something I'm not at all used to - but I'm sure I'll play through it again. By the way, I makes me happy that the Ori has TEN different slots for you and your family/friends to start a game on. I don't understand why so many games lack that.In short, I HIGHLY recommend playing Ori, andI can see no contraindicationsto warn buyers of. Gameplay, art and soundtrack are truly remarkable, and the story is surprising and nothing short of beautiful. This is a game that stands out, and one to remember for a long, long time. Thank you and congratulations to the developers for making such a brilliant game, and selling it for such fair price.Things Ori reminded me of, while playing: Studio Ghibli, Rayman, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, Guacamelee, Disney, The Lion King...I'll finish by quoting another reviewer: ""Oh how I wish there were more games like this one, especially when they come out of nowhere like this one did.""One of the best things I've played."

Absolutely breathtaking visuals, wonderful ambient soundtrack, and an emotional story that brought me to tears less than 5 minutes into the game.

And the fact that world changes after your actions is pretty cool too.But if you think that those cutesy looks cover a basic platformer - you cannot be mistaken more.This game is hard as hell. At some points I would even call it ""torture platformer"" because, well, it's a torture to get through those segments.But when you actually do - it's incredibly satisfying. I'd say it's very close to Dark Souls level of satisfaction after you figure out those hard parts.Using the controller to play works best, but keyboard works pretty well too.Oh, and did I mentioned this game was made using Unity? Next time someone says Unity is crap, show him this game.You can beat Ori in slightly more than 6h. I think 6h at the moment is best time in leaderboards. Took me 6h40m (and a lot of deaths) to beat it with 60% completion. So, it's not a very long game. That might be a bit of a downside for someBut I'd say it definitely does worth those $20.Other minor downside include a couple of smaller bugs (e.g. right trigger not working or 360-pad in some cases) that are known, do not harm the gameplay in a significant way and are being fixed.More detailed look in the video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFTGHrrW1A"

Honestly, it's perhaps the most beautiful looking 2D game I've ever played in my entire life.The environments are varied and interesting, the characters are adorable, the lighting is intense and colorful, the background paintings are stunning and the animations just make everything feel a lot more alive.Final Thoughts:I played through this game in just 2 sittings and I can't wait to play through it again.Even tough I usually dislike MetroidVania game and I'm not too fond of platformers, this has easily become one of my top 10 favorite games of all time.Despite the fact that I usually don't give a damn about achievements, I want them all.Despite the fact that I have no interest in Steam playing cards, I will collect them, because I want the badges and backgrounds.If you didn't buy it because it didn't seem like your thing, give it a try anyway.I think you won't regret it :)"

But this is intentional, and the save system complements this. You respawn in a fraction of a second and you don't get that helpless feeling of being dead and having to wait for it to load again, like in a lot of games.Super Meat Boy is another extremely challenging game that does this well: the levels are small but the challenge is huge, but you die and respawn so quick that you're never sitting around waiting.And just like Super Meat Boy, when you finally do get through a really tough section it feels so rewarding.I'd much rather die repeatedly in one spot for 3 minutes then have an entire game that doesn't challenge me.The game only took 10 hours to beat, which is surprising because it felt like much more. It's a big world and the complexity builds nicely throughout the game. But I know for sure this is a game I will play over again and again."
,Recommended,261570,17049342,"Posted: 14 July, 2015",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"Ori and the Blind Forest feels like Nintendo’s second coming.Despite having no connection to the revered developer you can see Nintendo’s fingerprints everywhere in Ori, in a way that’s deeper than rudimentary inspiration or recreation. It’s a design philosophy, one which wraps around Ori and grants it a feeling of immense knowledge and cohesion. This may be Moon Studio’s first release, but it brings with it the passion and insight present in so many of the most beloved games ever released while simultaneously transcending them, feeling like the next step forward rather than a mere imitation.Ori’s mechanical building blocks exist in a space that’s been exhaustively tapped and refined over the years (especially in the modern indie game industry), yet here take on a newfound innovation. It isn’t about “what” Ori is doing, so much as “how” is is executing it. There are countless precision and Metroid-like platformers now superficially working off almost the exact same routine as Ori, but what elevates Ori above them is its cohesion and forward thinking. It isn’t a collection of easily marketed parts assembled into a bizarre collage of styles and eras, but an astoundingly refined and unified vision that shares the same DNA as many of its peers but doesn’t allow that to define it.The most impressive aspect of Ori is in how everything is working together toward the same goal. Level designs combine with a steady progression to create a sense of constant forward momentum; the presentation conjoins with Ori’s movements to feel alive and organic; ideas expand and elaborate on themselves as the difficulty scales to match, breaking at just the right moments to never hinder the pacing.The level of skill with which Ori executes itself is remarkably precise and considered, even more so given its immense confidence which constantly reaffirms Moon Studios knows exactly what they’re doing. It’s not arrogant; it’s what allows Ori to so successfully advance beyond what has already been done.One of the most surprising aspects of Ori to me is how despite utilizing many of Metroid’s (and maybe to an even bigger extent Zelda’s) progression systems, backtracking is almost nonexistent. You might pass through a repeated area here and there (or if you want to head back and pick up some stuff you missed), but there is almost always a reason for it which drastically alters how you now travel from A to B. Ori makes revisiting old areas engaging because it almost never feels like the same area anymore. Your abilities grow so quickly and steadily that by the time you return to a familiar spot you are now traversing it in a totally different way. This eliminated one of my biggest grievances with this style of game, in that so often they seem to start and stop as you travel between one area to the next, requiring you to retread old ground almost exactly as you already did once before. That never happens in Ori, which meant I was constantly engaged in what I was doing and how.Where Ori had the biggest chance to fall apart was its difficulty, which is shockingly steep from the start and only goes up the further you progress. This is offset by how much can be visually understood about Ori’s level designs and how your character moves within them. Everything in Ori is in constant motion and with a great deal of discernible weight, which allows you to immediately know how far you’ll go with a jump, what’s in your path, and how you need to move past it. This certainly doesn’t make Ori anything approaching easy, but it does make it intuitive and approachable. It also makes it extremely fun just to move around and navigate the world, because it feels like you’re actually there interacting with it, feeling it move, discovering its secrets, and Moon has wisely left just enough room for human error that movement always feels organic and dynamic.It’s also hard to miss how breathtaking the world you’re traveling through is, though it’s even harder to explain that through words alone. Suffice it to say that whatever you thinking Ori looks like or how impressive it seems from the outside, it’s nothing like experiencing it first hand and being a part of it. Ori is a technical marvel, sure, through its multilayered presentation, the astounding framing (with just subtle enough an angle to give it depth), and how impossibly smoothly Ori animates in collaboration with it. What blew me away though is how it never stops topping itself, and how much it is able to hold back for its most awe-inspiring moments while still being staggeringly pretty. It manages the difficult balance between wow-ing the player and not overwhelming them, and by the end even calling it the most gorgeous game I’ve ever played seemed an understatement.There are a lot of easy things to praise Ori and the Blind Forest for, but it really is in how it comes together that makes it such a rich and enjoyable experience. It’s the feeling I get when I play things like Super Mario 3 or Super Metroid, which despite their age still present some of the best examples of concise, cohesive design which is missing from so many games. Ori understands this on a very deep level, and through that has created something  magnificent. It very well might be something that you can only understand through playing it yourself, but trust me when I say that’s something you want to do.You can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

,Recommended,261570,17542780,"Posted: 14 August, 2015",all,Nerd House,"Ori and the Blind ForestDeveloper: Moon Studios GmbHPublisher: Microsoft StudiosIntroduction==========The metroidvania subgenre has seen a lot of success in the past. Metroidvania (named for the 2 games that the term originates from: Metroid and Castlevania) games have very specific qualities and features that define it. The biggest of which is an expansive, inter-connected map. Other features includes secrets hidden everywhere, and progression being affected by new, unlockable abilities. They usually involve action-platformer elements as well. Ori and the Blind Forest perfectly fits all these criteria, and is one beautiful yet extremely challenging game.Gameplay==========Ori and the Blind Forest features a fantastic story, and you will most likely be moved to tears within the first few minutes. A quick (spoiler-free) rundown is as follows: The voice of the Spirit Tree in the forest of Nibel serves as the narrator, and the story begins when Ori fell from the tree during a storm as a newborn and was adopted by a sasquatch-like creature named Naru, who raised Ori as her own. After a series of events, Ori later meets Sein, a being who both guides Ori on his adventure and attacks enemies. In order to restore the forest, Sein guides Ori to recover the light of three main elements supporting the balance of Nibel: Waters, Winds and Warmth.Typical gameplay plays out like a platformer, with Ori learning new abilities as you explore and progress through the forest. Double-jumps, wall jumps, and more are all skills you will acquire and more than likely have to master if you wish to survive. There are enemies, shadow creatures, and more around every corner. And with Sein by your side, you have a way to defend yourself. At the press of a button Sein can fire off what's called Spirit Flames, which can be gradually upgraded with Skill Points. Skill points are earned when you collect a certain number of Spirit Light, which are dropped by defeated enemies or found hidden in dark corners of the forest. Skill points can be invested in 3 different skill trees, and you can spread points across all 3 trees if you wish.Ori has a few simple stats, which are upgraded by finding collectable power-ups: Life and Energy. Life is, well, how many hits Ori can take before dying. Energy is used to fuel certain abilities, such as creating a Soul Link (used to save your game and spend skill points), Charge Flame, and more. Defeating enemies and destroying certain objects in the forest can replenish both life and energy.Graphics==========Ori and the Blind Forest is a stunning game. It reminded me of Child of Light a lot. The backgrounds and foregrounds are very detailed, seemless, and flow smoothly as Ori traverses different sections of the forest. Speaking of sections, each one looks a bit different. Some are green and vibrant, filled with plantlife. While others are dark and dreary, covered with briars and the like. The cutscenes and character models are extremely well animated and polished. Everything concerning the looks of the game are nearly perfect. I couldn't find any flaws it in whatsoever. It's simply gorgeous.Sound and Music==========The music is hauntingly beautiful, almost spiritual, and that is made apparent the instant the menu screen comes up. In some areas it's ambient and soothing. In others it is desperate and tense, and usually fiting the theme of each section of the forest. The sound effects are crisp and fitting. Spirit Flame destroying enemies, jumping off walls, running across lush vegetation...all sounds great. I have no complaints about the sound or music in this game. There's simply nothing to critisize here!Performance==========Ori ran at a very healthy 60FPS at all times on my mid-tier custom-built rig, during cutscenes and normal gameplay. I experienced no stuttering or lag at any point. No slowdowns, and skipping, and no random crashes or freezes.The game has full controller support, which is *almost* a must for this game. Sometimes it requires precise button presses and platforming, which is made a lot easier with a controller. I didn't even try any other control schemes, as my controller worked so well.Final Thoughts==========Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the most beautiful and challenging games I have ever played. It shines in nearly all aspects, and is what I consider a near-perfect game. Lots of platforming, puzzles, and enemies to overcome make this a fulfilling Metroidvania title, and one that everyone should at least give a try. If anything, at least experience the opening story segments. If that hooks you, you are in for a wonderful ride.Gameplay Demo==========Story Intro:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ubZnGIK6gGameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WVVh_U7fX8Nerd House Verdict:==========A Must Play"

The art, the characters and their animations, the lighting and the splendid instrumental music score will instantaneously create a deep feeling of immersion. The storytelling, most of which occurs in-game, will also be supported by small doses of narration and beautiful cutscenes, just enough to give you a sense of purpose and accomplishment.The gameplay is everything you could possibly wish for: tight and responsive, with top-notch level design and an increasing number of mechanisms to master as you progress, in pure Metroidvania fashion. The overall difficulty achieves a fine balance, makingOriboth accessible to players who just want to enjoy the story and atmosphere, and challenging enough at times to keep veteran players on their toes. Exploration is rewarded with power-ups that give you more leeway to fill the simple-yet-efficient skill tree, which nicely complements the other abilities that you unlock as you advance through the game.A casual playthrough will last you a good 10 hours, and that alone would be well worth themoney. ButOrialso nudges the more hardcore players into giving it another go with an online speed run leaderboard and some pretty tight achievements like completing the game without dying. All in all, a very fair amount of content for its price tag with refined quality on top of that. The standard for an up-to-date adventure platformer and a definite recommendation for me."

I'm talking ""I-need-a-bucket-for-all-these-tears-how-can-I-feel-this-mUCH."" For the next five minutes or so, I stumbled my way through the game, blinded by the river coming out of my eyes. I don't even know how these game developers managed to reduce me to this in such a short amount of time. I blame the soundtrack.Once I finally managed to pull myself together, I was struck by the lovely art style- something I had heretofor been unable to fully appreciate in my sad, sad state. And then came the actual game. The controls feel very responsive, and the animations are smooth. I don't pretend to be an amazing platformer, but I think this will provide an adequate challenge for most players. I somehow managed to die 24 times in the first two hours- the struggle is all too real for me- but despite that, the nerd-rage never reached its peak. Once again, I look to the music. (It's quite calming, yet at the same time, it leaves you tensed for the next moment some story element comes to rip your heart out and leave you a sad, salty puddle on the floor.)In conclusion: 10/10, would die again.UPDATE: Reading back over my review, knowing what I know now, I can't help but laugh in despair. Oh, sweet summer child. Dying 24 times in two hours? If only I had been able to maintain that ratio! 7 hours in, and I have now died over 400 times- most of that on one specific segment. Tears are in my eyes as I write this. Please, for the love of all that is good, do not underestimate this game. Let me be an example to what happens to those that do. (Still 10/10, but would actually prefer NOT to die again. Please, God.)"

But I must see what happens next - so I keep going, gladly developing carpel tunnel to try and help little Ori achieve whatever it is he needs to achieve.So do I recommend Ori and the Blind Forest? Yes.I also suggest getting the soundtrack (it is on iTunes) as it is really, really good. :)"
,Recommended,261570,17006553,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,Athravan,"TL:DR - Buy it. Now.Ori and the Blind Forest is in my opinion, pretty close to the perfect 2D platformer. Stunningly beautiful visuals, tight, responsive controls and smooth animations. Interesting, progressive abilities, puzzles that are just hard enough to make me feel smart, hidden secrets and replayability, topped off with an excellent soundtrack. I really have nothing negative I can say about it.Platformers are not my biggest strength, and this one is a challenge - but it's a challenge that can be overcome, even if like me, you're going to spend half your playtime watching Ori dying horribly. I'm so sorry Ori. I tried my best.Every single time that your cute protaganist falls to his death, it will be your fault. I've played a lot of platformers that are frustrating because the level design is against you, the controls just didn't respond, the animation was too slow. There's nothing worse than feeling you're failing because of design flaws - but Ori doesn't feel like that. It feels like I'm failing because I'm old, and slow and that's fine - if even I can eventually manage it, anyone can and it makes it feel so much better when I finally achieve it. There is an achievement for completing the game without dying, and I will never get it. I'm proud to go 5 minutes, which is around my personal best so far.Finally, I was not expecting plot in my platformer, but this game has it and that really was the icing on the delicious, Ori-shaped cake. A gripping prologue draws you in and makes you care not just about Ori, but the entire forest. It's a simple plot, but it's charming and emotional. So just in case anyone actually read this far, stop thinking about it, get playing it. Let me know what you think!"
,Recommended,261570,15020094,"Posted: 23 March, 2015",all,crowbar,"rating: worth buying at full pricescore: 9.5/10 - must playsimilar games: Rayman Origins/ Legends, Guacamelee, Super Metroidtarget audience: fans of metroidvania, platformer, challenging games, disney-esque narrative and atmossphereShort summary: Wow. Ori and the blind forest is a small game, it costs only friggin 20€, is 8-10 hours long (which is long for an indie game) and those 8 hours I played it were so much fun, but also so inspiring for me, someone who is very interested for game design, because Ori is a game so well designed, no compromises (which means smaller target audience) which is really rare these days. But thats the way to make a game as good as possible and these guys managed to do that. There are some very minor things which were bad like sometimes visibility was a problem, but the core design of the game is perfect.GameplayI just want to give the devs huge credit for making no compromises. Every decision they made for this game feels like they made it because they want it to be the best game they can make, and not a game which the most people possible will play to make the most money. That means this game is really hard sometimes, but never unfair, and the difficulty curve is really good and also they teach the player really well except one thing I´ll explain later. This also means the game can be frustrating for some people, because they made a save system which can make you replay long sections of the game, but this save system is really smart. Its like a manual save system with quick-save only, but you cant abuse it, you cant make 100 saves and for a metroidvania/open-world game that would be fatal, so they made this save system which makes so much sense for this type of game. I just want to make clear how important this is in my opinion, because many games ♥♥♥♥ up stuff like this and make checkpoints all over the place which takes out the challenge. It can be annoying, because at first you will maybe forget to save sometimes, but youll get used to it. Also saving is not just a feature tagged onto the game, it is a mechanic which complements the rest of the game (you can even upgrade it and stuff) and its also a real thing in the lore of the game.What I also love about this game is how everything is focused on one thing, the platforming. I hate when developers make a game and tag on tons of features which dont bring depth, they only do it to have more content and variety because their main gameplay has not enough depth to keep you motivated. To explain this we can compare Ori to Guacamelee (which was a good game). In Guacamelee you had settled combat sections, platforming sections and boss fight sections. Sometimes you had platforming and combat combined and all of your combat moves were also platforming moves, but you still had this split. In Ori everything is a platforming section, every enemy you encounter is platforming and not combat (at the start of the game its combat to teach you its combat mechanics). The way enemys are designed and placed throughout the world are only that way because the devs knew this is a platformer.I also want to give them credit for their smart progression system which not simply fulfills the role to make your character stronger, it focuses more on giving the player more tools to play with, which bring more depth to the game, so the game actually gets harder without getting unfair. So enemys dont have simply more health and damage and the traps are not simply faster than before, you just have to combine more ""tools"" at your disposal, make more decisions as a player.I could talk hours about this game´s design, so let me quickly summarize the rest of the gameplay:- really good controls, perfect with mouse and keyboard- extremely smooth movement- lots of variety in enemy and level design- optional areas- rewarding exploration- tons of MEANINGFUL collectibles- big variety keeps you motivated throughout the whole gameThere was one thing in this game however which was a little annoying. Sometimes (like 2-3 times only) it was hard to see where I am supposed to go, this was mostly in sections where you had to move fast. In these sections you have to be quick, dodge obstacles and at the same time look where you have to go and suddenly they want you to use a mechanic you rarely you used in the game. This also happenend at the last ""boss""fight. The thing was you can use your bash on enemys and enemy projectiles, but you can also use it on boulders, but only on small ones, the game never tells you this. I tried using it on a normal boulder and it didnt work, so I thought you cant do that. But this is just a small thing.NarrativeSome people might say the narrative is barebones, and they would be correct, but the developers did the right thing. There is some text and some cutscenes but all of that is really short and spread throughout the game. You never get interrupted by annoying story-sections. However the narrative that was there was a little bit too cliche for my taste, but thats not a big deal. They created some really interesting and cool characters, and those characters never even talk.The most important thing (as always for me) is that the narrative keeps you motivated and complements the gameplay, its not a seperate thing. Also the ending was very satisfying and well made.Aesthetics/ GraphicsThis game is beatiful. I think thats obvious. Not much to say really. You can compare the graphics to Rayman Legends, its almost the exact same style. The animations are not as smooth as in Rayman Legends, but they are still really well made. But I have to say Rayman Legends is a little cleaner, I always could see enemys and obstacles. In Ori it was sometimes hard to tell if something is solid or not (sometimes something is solid, you can stand on it, but you can also jump on it from below, sometimes you cant), but its not a big deal. Unlike Rayman Legends though, where every level is a seperated from the rest of the world (loading screens), in Ori you have a full open world, everything is connected, you have no loading screens and you never get lost because of a really well made map. I say that because there are still games these days where they even ♥♥♥♥ up the map.SoundtrackThe soundtrack is really good, but its stuff you already heard a lot in other games and movies, especially the main theme sounds very familiar. But its still really good, fits the game and there some tracks which I really love. Overall though its not THAT memorable."

Every background and foreground object is hand painted to awe-inspiring effect. This combined with theincredible soundtrack from Gareth Cokeradds up to be one of the most stunning displays I've had the pleasure of enjoying. On top of the amazing visuals and soundtrack, we have a heart-wrenching story to go with all this that will definitely leave at least some (me) in tears throughout.Nestled within all this beauty is an exquisitely executed metroidvania platformer. Ori boasts fluid controls while still being extremely tight. It’s as if Moon Studios took the best aspects of Rayman Legends and Super Meat Boy’s controls with the result being a perfect marriage of the two vastly different titles. The progression of skills is steady and follows a logical succession. At first you’re barely able to jump over the smallest log, but by the end you’ll be nimble like the adorable little forest sprite that you are.Above all else, this game is HARD. Maybe not as hard as some of the most infuriating levels of Super Meat Boy, but the inspiration definitely shows; be sure to save often because the last thing you want is to die unexpectedly and have to go through that hell again. Then again, maybe that is exactly what you want. In a market where it’s increasingly taboo to actually kill the player in a single player game, Ori has no qualms with killing you over, and over, and over again. That said, the deaths are never cheap or feel like the result of poor level design or other shenanigans; it’s abundantly clear that if you die, it’s your own fault.I want everyone to play this game and love it as much as I do. I look forward to getting as many of the achievements that I can, no matter how difficult some of them seem to be.To Moon Studios, thank you for delivering such an incredible experience. This is why I love video games. I can’t really express just how much I’ve fallen in love with Ori, Sein, Naru, Koru, and all the other characters in this masterpiece."

,Recommended,261570,14845222,"Posted: 11 March, 2015",all,Ylzor,"At first, I thought Ori and the Blind Forest was just going to be a beautiful game with basic gameplay. Not only does it play really well, but it also blew me away with its graphics, music and its touching story even though I knew what the game looked like before I played it. But it's only when you start playing (with a controller or keyboard/mouse, both work well) that you get it. Just watching the game is not enough ; you have to play it to fully understand what the game really wants you to feel.It's not an easy game, but it's not so hard that it makes you wanna punch your screen or anything. I've read some complaints about the game having too much ""die & retry"" in it. I disagree, as there are only 2, maybe 3 scenes in the game that can be considered that. The game always stays fair though, and it's just hard enough to make you feel like you're never really safe, even though you already picked every single health bonus you can get.And those bonus can be really fun to look for. As a metroid-vania, you'll have to come back to some parts of the world using shortcuts you just created with your new powers. There's no teleportation here, everything is connected, yet it never feels like a pain to go back anywhere. Maybe it's thanks to the amazing graphics and music, but travelling back to a place you've already been to is always a pleasure. But it won't just be running, as enemies are always present in the game and will respawn.Combat is pretty simple and easy ; press a button and a homing attack will deal damage to an enemy. You still have to dodge though, as Ori is very fragile, especially early in the game when getting killed in one or two hits is not rare. It gets easier though as you gain points by killing enemies and finding sometimes well hidden orbs to make your little guy stronger or to show things on the map. You can create a save point yourself, and you should since the default save points are rare. It has a cooldown and requires energy though, but those can be reduced if you spend your points in the right place.And saving is really important, since you'll die a lot. Not necessarily because of enemies, but because of the platforming element of the game. Don't get me wrong; the game controls perfectly and some moves are just amazing both to look at and to do. Some jumps are not easy, even though it never gets as crazy as, let's say, Super Meat Boy, but none of them feels unfair. Sometimes you'll get to a place and wonder how you're supposed to make a jump that seems impossible to do, but in the end you just do it naturally. I won't spoil the moves you get later in the game, but I'll just say that I've never liked the ""Y"" button on my controller that much before.In short, this game is a masterpiece. If I had to find something wrong with the game, I'd say the game is a bit short (I read 10+ hours, I finished the game in less than 7 hours, taking my time and exploring a lot). For 20 eurodollars (I'd say the same for 40 though), this is a game I highly encourage you to buy. And buy the soundtrack too, even though it isn't the same without the rest of the game, it's still amazing."

The gameplay is fun with many skills to acquire as you progress, there's also a talent tree to spend your points on.  World of Ori is beautiful and mysterious, you want to know more of it and the game does it well.The best parts of Ori are definitely the incredibly beautiful story, music and artstyle, it's hard to explain how it is, you just have to see it for yourself. When the music kicks in at different areas of the game, it makes you feel a lot and it keeps you going to see more of this amazing game. It's some of the best music I have heard. Sometimes it reminded me of songs I heard in my favorite movies like The Lord of the Rings or games like Shadow of the Colossus. The story is emotional too and you want to see how it ends <(^_^)>, I admit I shed a few tears in certain moments.Ori and the Blind Forest gets more difficult, the further you get in the story. In quite early of the game, I thought damn this is hard...but it was nothing yet. The end stage gave some of the most challenging obstacles I've had to surpass in a while with games, which resulted in countless of deaths lol <(T_T)>. The game has a lot of puzzles in it which is great, but also a lot of backtracking when you unlock new areas, I didn't mind it though.I think it's the first 2D platformer game I've played in a long time. I remember playing Sonic the Hedgehog during Sega Genesis era a lot and another one was that thing called Ray Man, but I don't think I had many games of this genre afterwards.It's safe to say, that Ori and the Blind Forest is one of my all time favorite games after finishing it :), I loved it. Was great to come back and play a platformer again. It took me about 11-12 hours to finish the story, but it can take a lot longer depending on how you play it and how fast you solve puzzles and overcome enemies. For me, it felt like it took a lot longer to see the end and it was hard to stop playing sometimes.

I could talk about the controls or the level design, which are normally the most important points for me for any platformer... If I did that, I would be comparing it favorably to the best platformers I've ever played. But in spite of the game's excellence in those areas, it is its visual and musical supremacy that sticks in my mind.Friends of mine, even friends who don't normally like platformers, beg me to stream this game for them, equating it to ""audiovisual crack"". Occasionally—even after my third full playthrough—I find myself stopping, overwhelmed for a few moments by what I'm seeing. It has set a new visual standard for me, one which every other game I've played to date falls well short of achieving.As for the music... In-game, it is sublime and nearly seamless. It isn't that it sets the mood of the game, nor vice versa; the soundtrack and the rest of the game simply... complete each other. Perfectly. To the note. And, listening to bits of the soundtrack outside the focusing influence of the game itself, I find myself moved in ways I haveneverbeen moved by music before.I am normally loquacious and pride myself on my vocabulary, but words completely fail me when I try to describe how this game looks and sounds and feels.

The art is nothing short of stunning for a 2D platformer, I watched the trailer and went ""Pfft, graphics are probably cranked up and ones we won't get at all."" Pleasently surprised on that one when I loaded it up and it was exactly the same as the trailer, the same beautiful backgrounds and the soundtrack that pulls it all together.One of the few games that actually had a decent story in the recent years (a 2D platformer no less), games seem to have been lacking engaging story, story that actually makes you care, that makes you want the character to succeed not simply so you can reach the end. One of the few that have actually caused a tear to come to my eye.Onto the negatives (few as they are), there are some sections that left me puzzles for a while I got stuck on one area, wondering how to proceed for about 20 minutes, I got it eventually and really enjoyed it. That being said some areas require trial and error, can I survive this? Whats down this hole that I cant see the bottom of etc. There were some difficulty spikes (you'll know them when you see them) but that being said they were welcome. I don't want the game to hand me the victory like so many new release games, the victories you make by beating these spikes feel amazing. I truely felt a sense of accomplishment after going through these challenges and surviving.There's so much more I want to write and yet I can't because it would ruin the beautiful experience that Ori and The Blind Forest can give you. If you have a 20 spare, think about putting it into Ori, best money I've spent this year so far.Happy GamingCinderpalm"

It’s truly a work of Art. The Story, the art style and the wonderful Soundtrack … everything works in harmony.I’m not gonna lie when I’m telling you that, at one point in the Story, I started to hate the game at one point but let’s get to that later.Playing it was exciting and calming at the same time. Exciting as in exploring every angle of the world, learning more about the Story and calming as in just embracing the wonderfully crafted world and listening to the genius soundtrack that comes along with it. Not to mention even the slight narration is something that just manages to give the game way more depth.StoryThe Story, narrated by the voice of the Spirit Tree, is about a Guardian Spirit namedOriwho fell from the tree during the Storm. A creature calledNaruadopted the newbornOriand raised her as her own. They live happily and in harmony up until a cataclysmic event withers the forest and therefore the food supply.I’m terribly sorry but this is as much as I can say about the Story. One of the memorable events in the game happens right in the prologue and I seriously don’t want to spoil anything.I’m just gonna say this … The Mother makes sure that her Child survives at a cost. You can guess what happens and it truly caught me off guard and later in the Story I was at a point where I was about to hate the game for making me so emotional again since all of a sudden something happens and you’re left alone with all your emotions and …The Story is genius. That’s all I can say.GameplayOri and the Blind Forestis a 2D Metroidvania with a strong plattforming focus.There are a lot of jumping puzzles and many secrets to be explored and found and all that happens in one of the most beautiful and atmospheric worlds in the industry.Later on you meet a being of light calledSeinwhich acts basically as your guide and your weapon. You shoot so calledSpirit Flameswhich will attack the nearest enemy meaning you can’t specifically aim at one enemy. You have to be close enough to it for you to be able to actually attack it.Something to mention is that the controls do actually feelpixel-perfectand the game itself, while looking rather cute, is really challenging. Every death will be your own fault. The game does have save points but those are pretty rare and once you die you will loseeverythingyou managed to accomplish since your last save. While this might sound off putting in truth it isn’t.You’re able to create aSoul Linkif you happen to have enough energy, granting you the ability to save your game whenever you want to and also accessing your Skill Tree so you can decide how to spend your Ability Points to either develop yourCombat, Utility or Efficieny.As the name says theCombat Treeenhances your power and helps you to quickly deal with your enemies, while theEfficiency Treegives you access to abilities likeTriple Jumpor being able to breath in clean water.That being said the controls are fluid and fit. I haven’t had any problems at all with the controls or the gameplay in general quite the opposite to be honest.VisualsBeautiful and stunning. Those words come first to my mind.The whole world just looks so beautiful and just makes you wanna continue playing just so you can see more of it. It’s a Metroidvania of another and modern Art but at the same time … It’s just a piece of art. I don’t know what else to say. The game does look like a Movie or rather a Painting come to life. Everything just fits. Everything. There’s not one bit you could point at and say that it doesn’t look good or fit into the game. You just can’t. The Art Style is wonderful, looks highly polished and … exceptional. Extraordinary.Thanks to it’s beautiful Design I do feel like Children and Adults as well will be drawn to it.At the same time I feel likeHayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibliwas a huge inspiration and influence toMoon Studios. The Visuals remind me just of some of theGhibli Moviesas well as not only the character but also the Background Design.AudioI know, I know … I repeat myself but the Soundtrack is stunning and perfect.There’s no other way to describe it. You’ll immerse yourself into the World thanks to this beautiful Soundtrack. The soundtrack infused the game with raw emotion and life. Just listen to the soundtrack. I caught myself staying longer in a certain region of the world just so I could listen to the soundtrack while running around and exploring every last angle of the world.Harmony, peace, fear, hope, desperation, anticipation … those are just a few feelings I had when I listened to the Soundtrack. You have to listen to it. You owe it to yourself. The Soundtrack toOri and the Blind Forestis one of the best in the industry.What else can I say about this wonderful game?Emotional. Perfect. Beautiful. Memorable.You could use so many words to describeOri and the Blind Forestbut it all boils down to those four. Youwillcare about the game. Youwantto find out more about the Story andKuro. Youwon’tforget this game. Ever. I’m not gonna lie when I’m telling you here and now thatOri and the Blind Foresthit me deep in the feels. Two times folks … I got two times emotional while playing the game and I’m not ashamed to admit that. It’s just a sign to me that I did connect with the game on a certain level and that the folks over atMoon Studiosmanaged to create a game that will do exactly this: Connect with the Player.I can honestly say this: I won’t forget this game nor the Characters. Be itOri,Naru,GumoorKuro…I struggle for words if I’m completely honest. It’s rare that Iconnectwith a game on such a level. Everything appeals to me. The Visual, the Audio, the Story, just everything.Personally I’d sayOri the Blind Forestdeserves aGame of the Year Award.WhatMoon Studiosmanaged to pull of over the course of four years is an exceptionally stunning and memorable game.It's worth every penny. In fact call me crazy but ... this game would actually deserve a 60 Bucks price tag. Not even kidding. The game might be fairly short but still if you take into consideration what you're getting for your money ... It's worth so much more trusty me on that.My personalGame of the Yearand it managed to become one of my favorite games."

,Recommended,261570,22106558,"Posted: 28 March, 2016",all,The Slothful Existentialist,"Overview:Ori and the Blind Forestis an open-world, 2D, story-driven, action-adventure platformer with exploratory gameplay and entertaining combat; the game is visually outstanding as well as sonically masterful with an amazing soundtrack. It was developed by Moon Studios -a group consisting of talented developers spread out over Europe, the Middle East, Oceania, and North America- using the Unity engine. It’s published by Microsoft Studios. The game is currently available for Xbox One and PC.It's one of the best games I've ever played.Story:We’re thrown right into the narrative, as the Spirit Tree begins to tell the tale of how it ‘lost’ newborn spirit Ori to the forest of Nibel due to a storm. Ori, now orphaned, is raised by Naru, a benevolent bear-like creature. Later, a cataclysm leaves the forest in decay, and Naru passes away as a result. Orphaned once more and with his surrounding forest dying, Ori finds Sein, who is ‘the light and the eyes of the Spirit Tree’ and offers to guide Ori in his quest to restore the forest to its previous state: full of life and harmony. In his adventures Ori learns of the events that triggered the cataclysm, and faces several obstacles in his quest. Among them a long-limbed creature named Gumo, who becomes Ori’s ally after making his life a little difficult; a gigantic owl name Kuro, a creature of the darkness who attempts to prevent Ori from restoring light to the forest; and many enemies along the way from whom Ori has to defend himself.The plot is filled with a wide range of emotions, from carefree bliss to hopeless depression, and includes anything in between: annoyance, humour, curiosity, confusion, kindness, etc... Moon Studios did a marvellous job of tugging at the appropriate heartstrings through various events, resulting in a highly captivating and internalized storytelling experience.Oritakes influence from animated films likeThe Lion KingandThe Iron Giant, both of which are coming-of-age stories; in turn,Orialso feels very much like a coming-of-age story. The narrative has a peculiar tone and style to it, it likes to use vague but guiding vocabulary, allowing the player to infer quite a bit and interpret the themes of the plot (kindness, sacrifice and parenthood). The characters are all wonderfully written; there isn’t any excess, and that (together with its incredible visuals) makes the world surrounding the player feel fluous and whimsical.Gameplay:I cannot fail to mention the calibre of level design and game mechanics. The gameplay is some of the most fluid and well animated that I’ve had the pleasure to experience. This may be partly because I haven’t played too many games in the past year, or it might be simply because Moon Studios has some immensely skilled devs in their ranks. Ori has abilities and skills that he learns throughout the progression of the game, these skills are learned at the Ancestral Trees. The player can upgrade abilities by gaining experience through finding Ability Cells, or absorbing Spirit Light by defeating different kinds of enemies which have different types of attack mechanisms. There’s so much to do in the game: solve puzzles, defeat enemies, collect Energy Cells and Life Cells (more energy slots and life slots, respectively), use upgraded abilities to explore previously unavailable places, and ultimately restore the forest.Falling into the genre of ‘metroidvania’, the game definitely takes after classics likeMetroidandRayman, which directly influenced the gameplay ofOri.Oriis very much intended as a ‘love letter’ to those games. The map itself is one huge open world; there are no loading screens, just exploration through jumping, climbing, swinging, bashing, etc… It’s no Dark Souls, but if you do not save often this game is very unforgiving.Graphics:Writing about the visual aspect of this game is difficult, because I’m at such a loss for words, it is probably the prettiest 2D game I have ever seen. The animations are pure magic and the hand-painted assets and environments are what make the whole game’s atmosphere cohesive. Designers took inspiration from a few well-known works, such as Hayao Miyazaki’sNausicaä of the Valley of the Windand Disney’sThe Lion King. The level “Valley of the Wind” is a straight-up tribute toNausicaä. One of the things I think is the coolest about this game is that in the backgrounds there are no recycled assets; one of the two founders, Thomas Mahler, says:""You see this tree in the background and this mushroom and this rock? That's the one and only place you'll ever see those assets.""I find this to be amazing because most games today tile their textures or re-use assets already used elsewhere in the game. Unique assets make the game’s environments feel as real, fresh, non-repetitive and original as they possibly can.Onto the character ‘Ori’, the star of the game. He’s this little creature, a mix between a dog, a cat, a rabbit and a monkey. He’s got a weird little design, but awesome nonetheless; Ori is one of the coolest animalistic characters I’ve had the chance to play as. From his jumping and running animations to the way he interacts with different mechanisms of the game, the character feels as alive as perceptively possible.Sound:Sound is -a lot of the time- as important as the visuals in a video game. The audio of any given game is what gives life to the user experience, a game’s sound is what completes it, what makes you immerse yourself and just forget about whatever’s going through your head.Ori’s soundtrack by itself is serene and beautiful enough to make you disengage yourself from your surroundings. Give it a couple of hours and you’ll completely forget where you are, courtesy of composer Gareth Coker.The audio design in this game is next to flawless. All the way from footsteps to the environment sounds, to the narration, the audio is simply mesmerizing. The atmosphere, the ambience that the sound manifests, it’s magnificently special.Final Thoughts:I dove into this game with minimal knowledge about it, I knew was that it was a very pretty and successful game. But there wasn’t much about it besides the seemingly amazing story and visuals that drew me in - until I read about the developers.Did you know Moon Studios doesn’t have a location? It’s an independant worldwide collaboration between many talented people all over the world, the two founders (Thomas Mahler & Gennadiy Korol) are veterans in their fields. Mahler previously worked at Blizzard on Starcraft 2 and Korol was Senior Graphics and Tools Engineer at Animation Lab (an Israeli feature-film animation studio). Among their employees Moon Studios has some extremely talented people.Choosing to play this game was a great call, it provided me with some of the most memorable moments I’ve had in recent gaming andgot me out of a crippling writer’s block.The fact that it was nominated for so many awards should tell you how well-made it is. And if not, the fact that it WON Best Art Direction among other awards should.The game made me feel happy, sad, loved, alone, powerful, weak and a mixture of many other sentiments. It has become one of my all-time favourites, once I began playing I could not bring myself to stop; it’s challenging and frustrating but completely satisfying at the same time. I enjoyed every single second of it. In my humble opinion, this game is near-perfect."
,Recommended,261570,14833241,"Posted: 10 March, 2015",all,SAYA,"First off: I haven't played a platformer as good as this one in a long time.While the mechanics aren't exactly the most you can get out of the genre everything else is pretty much spot on.The soundtrack is amazing, the very ghibliesque and mellow visuals can switch from a calm stroll over a meadow to full on action chase scenes and the overall presentation is stellar, which becomes evident from the second you start up the game and browse through the snappy menu.The intro starts off very strong and builds the premise quickly and lets you easily empathize with your main character. Although it's a very simple and basic storyline it'll hit you right in the feels from the very first minute again shining especially in the visual department.The gameplay itself is basic metroidvania with a big interconnected map with lots of places to explore and resources to gather (that enhance your character either through the skill tree, health or mana upgrades). Enemy variety is alright, though not great either. They fit well into the world, even if they are rather generic and don't vary too much from level to level, but the interaction with your abilities that you'll unlock later (separate from your skill tree that enhances them further) adds another degree of gameplay on top of what you're getting used to, so it's unlikely that you'll get bored easily.I'm only roughly 3 hours in, but so far the (mini?-)bosses are a bit underwhelming. Games like Outland made them feel a lot more epic while in this game they seem to be very generic, small enemies that have more health than the regular ones and only slightly differ from the non-boss enemies.But yeah, that's pretty much all my criticism right now. Despite the little flaws the developers behind this made a huge effort to craft a very well put together videogame that is absolutely worth it's 20$/20€ price tag, so my verdict is:BUY"

If you are into platformers, this is a great game for you. This is not an EASY platformer either. In fact, once you beat the game and want to challenge yourself some more, there are some hard as hell achievements to go after which will no doubt keep you wanting to come back.Though Ori and the Blind Forest does not tell a story with a huge amount of dialect, it does not need to. The characters themselves are quick to identify with which I must give the developers an A+ for because within the first five minutes of the game at the end of the Prologue (which I recommend you do before playing the main story), I was crying. This game will pull at your heartstrings. This is a story that tells one of tragedy. The way the story is portrayed is beautiful. The soundtrack really sets the tone of it too. You will not just feel sad for Ori, you will feel sad for the other characters too, even the villainess.I cannot recommend this game enough, this is by far, one of the BEST games I have ever played on Steam by far. My only, ONLY gripe with this game is that there are some areas which, once you complete you cannot return to if you wish to hunt for collectibles which means you cannot get 100% completion if you miss those collectibles. I hope the devs can somehow fix this. Asides from that though, this game deserves all the praise and recognition it has been receiving from the public. This is, A GREAT GAME.My rating:9.5/10The only reason it lost the 0.5 was due to the issue of some areas become closed off permanately so if you miss the collectibles, you miss out for good unless you replay the game from the beginning. But don't let that stop you from playing this game. It is great, a worthy addition to anyone's Steam Library or on any other platform this is available."

It was even more fun on the second playthrough even though there is basically no replay value (except collecting all the upgrades). That's how good this game is.I have never played a game where the music added SO MUCH. The music is perfect at all times. I think the music is 80% responsible for letting almost everyone cry.There is one weird part about the controls when you play it with a controller. You can activate a move via moving the left analog-stick down. I unintentionally activated it while platforming and died sometimes just because of it. Other than that it's perfect.Favourite singleplayer game of all time for me.

The score will go down as a classic when all is said and done and reminded me of how I felt the first time I heard Uematsu's amazing Final Fantasy 7 score.Without getting into the particulars of the story, it's a relatively timeless story of love with elements of nature and fantasy mixed in to provide the backbone. Ori is a very lovable avatar and the way the story is composed, Ori as a character will help entice you to keep playing.According to Steam, I have put 14 hours into this game at the time of this review. This is virtually all devoted to the main game. I did take some time to explore to seek out upgrades and such, but for the most part this time is due to the awesome challenge provided by the game's tight platforming mechanics, intriguing puzzles, and all around great atmosphere. I highly suggest you play this game with a gamepad.Pros:+ Beautiful game technologically. Graphics, music, everything shines.+ Very challenging in spots. It's not the hardest platformer you'll ever play by any stretch, but the challenges are fun and rather than cause rage, make you want to succeed pulling something off.+ Charming story and characters. Even the ""villain""!+ A game for anyone to enjoy. Young and old. If you enjoy platformers, this is a must-play.Cons:- Replayability for some may be low. I think this is more of a YMMV scenario. I can see some finishing this game and moving on and never returning and I can see others wanting to master it, aim for speed-runs, and that sort of thing. It really depends on your appetite as a gamer for this genre of game.- The end portion is not as challenging as I assumed it was going to be in the lead-up. I can't call it a let down, but I think there was a missed opportunity to extend the end game.Needless to say, I loved this game from the word go. It starts seemingly slow with exposition and setting up the ""journey"" you're about to take, but once the game gets going, it goes. The challenge ramps up as you go on and you'll be thankful after a hard slog of trial and error and have something laid back before diving into the next challenge.Fantastic game and worth it at full price, but even better if you get it on sale!Rating: 9/10"

76561198181535913,Recommended,261570,14831722,"Posted: 10 March, 2015",all,griffinharvey78,"I recommend this game to anyone who was a fan of the old school platformers like I was. The gameplay is flawless and there is tons of stuff to see in terms of art work. It is just beautiful to look at. With in the first few seconds of playing the game I was already blown away by how great it looks. I've seen videos of the game on websites and I thought it looked amazing then, but actually playing it in person is just in a whole new world.I have only played the game for about 40 minutes, but in that amount of time I just had to give my thoughts, GREAT GAME.  Nice change of pace from all the call of duty and assasins creed crap every year. We NEED more games like this.I have never been impacted with such emotions from playing a video game since playing Okami, and I have to say, that what games should be like. Not the 'Oh I just quick scoped a noob' in shooter games.I plan to get the xbox one also that way I have two copies of the game, even if I own a ps3. TRUE gamers don't care what console they play on, they just want to play the game. Playing this game is a prime example of that.Thank you Moon studios, you really out did yourselves.Edit: Ok, now that I have beaten the time, I'm going to go into more depth of my review without spoiling any big parts of the story.Gameplay:  As I said before the gameplay is nearly flawless and pretty much everything works the way it's made for. Some of the puzzles can be quite confusing at first but with a little thinking you can solve them. The game starts out easy, but as you progress and get more power ups and upgrades, the game gets alot harder. I mean A LOT harder. One example would be out climbing the flooding ginso tree they showed at gamescon. Sure it looked easy when they showed it, but when I tried it myself, I was kind of surprised at how tough it was, and it took me about 15 tries before I got it right. I'm not going to say whats going to happen to future escape sequences so I don't spoil you guys, but just a heads up, they get HARDER as you go. But when you finally beat them, it's very fulfilling. Timing is also a key factor in solving puzzles. One more recommendation, use PLENTY of soul links whenever you can. It gets very frustrating when you get far in a part of the game, only to die and go back like 20 minutes of game-play simply because you for got to make a check point. The health system in my opinion is kind of useless, as later on in the game enemy attacks and stage hazards are pretty much a instant death.Sound and music: The sound affects and music are what make up a third of the game. Just like the story and the visuals make up the other two thirds.  Everything you do has a very unique sound to it such as branches and twigs sound like wood breaking and rocks sound like crumbling an so forth. Even down to when Ori emerges from the water, just the cute sound of him gasping for breath is amazing. Some of my favorite sounds would be the wind. Just the sound of the wind blowing through the leaves is outstanding. The music is very fitting for the situation. Slow and peaceful music in the bright open areas of the forest, while you get more suspenseful and intimidating music in a place that's more dark and secluded. You also get fast paced music for sequences that are more fast paced and each one is different so it feels like you just are truly in a different place, not just in terms of look, but in feel. The music is just great and I even bought the soundtrack to prove it.Visuals and graphics: This was the big eye catcher for most people, I'm no exception. The look of the game is very vibrant and clean. Even if it's a 2-D plat-former, the games background has some 3-d elements to it such as trees in the background, and rocks and water more close to the screen. Everywhere you go you will see something new and will never once see the same thing twice.( unless you're back tracking to a place you've already been.)  I really have nothing else to say about the graphics other then that it's great and goes along great with the music and sound.Verdict:  Ori and the blind forest is a Great action game that I recomennd to anyone. While I'm am a little disappointed that the game wasn't as long as the developers said it would be at around 10 hours, ( me about 5 ) it's still a great game regardless and at $20, you cant really complain, and the game does get frustrating at times but it always feels good when you get past whatever was giving you trouble.9/10Edit #2:  Ok, apparently this game has NO continued play. Meaning you can't go back and collect the rest of the upgrades and collectables. Once you finish the game in a save slot, that's it, done, it won't let you play that save file anymore, meaning you have to start a new game from scratch from a new save file or delete the one you just completed. While I don't mind playing the game a second time, and it might actually be funner since I know it better, it is still a disapointment that you cant go back and get the rest of the items and secrets.8 1/2 - 10."

So you will be backtracking on the map to pick up different power upgrades that will help you to reach new areas.You also have three talent trees you can upgrade by gaining xp. These trees are for damage, utility/health and map upgrades. The story is simple but quite memorable.Ori is a real joy to control, it's intuitive, precise and responsive. The level design is terrific, challenging the players's physical and mental dexterity. And it truly is challenging, I died over 200 times on my playthrough. I'm not exaggerating there's a death counter. Luckily you can place your own checkpoints so it's not very punishing. The challenge made the game very rewarding to play but also might scare away some players, which is a shame.The game looks gorgeous, the art is beautiful and the colors are bright. Magnificent soundtrack makes the game even better. The music works especially well in the few escape sequences in the game, in which it encourages the player to continue even after failing without the feeling of frustration player death  might bring. It's not a very long game, 7-10 hours depending on how many hidden collectibles player is going for and the player's skill ofcourse. The value is balanced by a moderate price.[Score: 90]"

I haven't seen any Microsoft game that have this beautiful graphics and music.GameplayI would recommend you to use controllers to play this. This game is a 2D platform so controllers can do a pretty good job on those parts which are fast-pace or hard.

Just look at the screenshots.The soundtrack is simply brilliant, the sort you can listen to for hours.The story can bring a tear to the eye in the first ten minutes.If you don't think games can be art, Ori and the Blind Forest is my rebuttal.Moving swiftly from aesthetics to gameplay, the game is difficult. VERY difficult. It starts out simple enough, but soon teaches you that any mistake can be your last, with a vast amount of enemies who will not hesitate to crush, shoot, spike, ram, and generally injure you in any way they can. Still, despite the diversity in the opponent's ranks, Ori is far from helpless. With the help of a little ball of light named ""Sein"", Ori can shoot enemies, charge for a powerful explosive blast, leap from wall to wall, and through enemies, even redirect the opponents attacks them!as you progress through the game, you will increase your health, your energy pool, and can spend ability points to make yourself stronger. You can make your attacks hit multiple targets, shoot faster, deal more damage, that sort of thing. You can make health and experience orbs fly toward you (TAKE THAT. IT MAKES EVERYTHING EASIER), or you can make your abilities more useful, by way of healing you when you use them, or simply being cheaper.The game feels very quick-paced, and the movement feels very fluid, and natural, making for an exiting, very enjoyable gaming experience.If I had one complaint, it would probably be the controls for the ""bash"" ability. I find that it can sometimes be a little awkward to aim, often sending me in the wrong direction, that said, I can be rather clumsy, and I am new to the game, so I am fairly certain I will get the hang of it with time.Anyway, drawing this review to a conclusion, this game is a visual masterpiece, has an amazing soundtrack, and is a game I would recomend it to anyone, so long as you don't mind a challenge.at the time of writing this review, 97% of the reviews are positive, and the developers definitely earned it."

,Recommended,261570,17323380,"Posted: 31 July, 2015",all,TheIronicGamer,"I never thought a game could be perfect, but this game is as close to perfection as a game could ever get. I played through the entire game trying to find one mistake that the developer made. Needless to say I found absolutely nothing wrong with this game at all. Ori and the blind forest was clearly created with love by the developers and every feature was considered and researched properly before being put into the game.StoryA very intriging story. Theres not much I can say about the story without spoiling it. What I will say is it is follows a family love between characters and is filled with moments that could make you cry or smile with delight. It is a rare game that can bring out these feelings in you and it is a truly beatiful story.GameplayAnyone who is a fan of platforming games will love this. What really suprised me though and I didn't expect it is that as well being focused on platforming it also has a large focus on combat. A great combat system at that. Very fun combat which leaves you having to run and jump about while fighting to avoid being hit. Also a large enemy variety that make you have to adapt to situations to fight different enemies. The combination of this combat system and hard platforming make Ori a very difficult game that could lead to raging moments. But boy is it satisfying when you finally kill that enemy or reach that platform you've been trying to get to for ages.UpgradesNow to keep the longevity of enjoyment of a game throughout playing there has to be a good upgrade system that evolves as you play. Ori does exactly that. What is unique though is that platforming elements that are usually in a game from the start are unlocked as you play. This includes abilities such as double jump and wall jump. It means that the game gets even more fun and difficult as you play. It is a strange choice to do this but I think it works very well in the circumstances of the game. What it means is that certain areas can't be accessed until you get these abilities. It makes for some artificial linearity to the game. These are abilities are unlocked as you play through the story.There is also another upgrade system that you can control. As you play the game you get experience through killing enemies and finding hidden secrets. These earn you ability points that can be used to unlock upgrade in one of three different upgrade trees. These include things like upgrading your other earned abilities or giving your character new abilities to use. It is very flexible and all of the upgrades seem to make a noticeable difference to gameplay and aren't useless.SoundtrackOne of the best soundtracks I have heard in a game. Beatiful music artisticly crafted can manipulate your feelings. All of the music fits in perfectly with the situation. So sad scenes and high energy combat scenes all have the most appropriate music. The main menu soundtrack is absolutely incredible as well and is definitely something I wouldn't mind listening to again. There are so many unique tracks as well so you definitely won't get bored of listening to the same songs over and over. This soundtrack was definitely crafted with love and it definitely shows.GraphicsMan are these great. I thought trines graphics were something that couldn't be beaten and then I saw ori. This is something else. The whole game is beatiful and nothing seems out of place. They even put effort into the smallest of details like plants to make for a more complete and flawless experience. Never have I seen a game with such a consistent art style that is such a pleasure to look at.AnimationsThis was something of a suprise. Usually games neglect animations and go for pretty basic ones that do the job just well enough to work. Ori didn't follow this trend. The animations flow so well. Everthing that is needed to is animated on the game and everything is flawlessly great. This includes the main character (ori), plants and enemies. The fact that they put so much effort into making even the animations perfect really shows how lovingly this game was crafted. All animations are unique and fantastic.ConclusionI can't recommend this game enough to anyone. if you are a fan of platformers then you will ""LOVE"" this game. It is definitely one of the greatest games I have ever played!TheIronicGamers rating systemDon't ever buy this game.Maybe consider it on a sale.An average game.A good game that should definitely be considered.A must play!"

Just 3 trees that don't branch off in any way to let you pick a path of how to play.

You don't need me telling you that.Rather, I'd like to use this space to point out some of the issues I had. Note again, the game is still great, but man oh man, these few points just frustrated me to no end. I hope if the developers make a sequel they could work on a few of these points. Damn I sure want them to because this game is so beautiful,My main issue? The story falls apart so completely in the end. It completely undermines everything I did in the game and left me feeling very unsatisfied, almost angry, when the credits rolled.A few other, more minor points- The difficulty curve is just... I don't know, odd. Most of the game will bore hardcore players, while the first gauntlet will crush casual players. Not to mention that it just strangely gets easier and easier as the game progresses, with more and more saves available to you and enough health to just tank through everything.- Powerups can be hidden in parts of the game YOU CAN NEVER RETURN TO!- Too many redundant abilities. Why do we need wall jump and wall run? The latter seems to exist entirely so we have FOUR different kinds of charge/dash abilities, and they all use different inputs! There is something to be said for games that can be challenging without overcomplicating their mechanics.- Just a little too short. Really, it feels like this game needs about an extra 30%, maybe one more area and temple.- When I got the breathe underwater power, I realized I already had finished basically the only underwater section, so I wouldn't have minded they expand on that area especially.Again, I'd actually recommend this game because it's just so beautiful, with 2D art even better than the Rayman games in my opinion. The gameplay is fun, and the world is colourful.I can't believe I am saying this, but if they had cut out the story, I would have loved this game so much more."

While the story is very simple and generic, the execution through all the other factors of this game molds one of the most cohesive experiences in a single-player game.8/10on the story.I have not tried the keyboard controls, but I can say in great certainty that the controller button mapping is excellent; though, it would be nice if there was a feature to customize controls. The handling of Ori in the game is very fluid and smooth; Ori is a very flexible and acrobatic character and is able to maneuver gracefully through the entirety of the map. I personally had no serious trouble with the handling and controlling of Ori, and despite having felt cheated on certain portions of the game due to the controls, I look back at that and realize that it's not because of the controls; the game places an emphasis on replayability and challenge.9/10on the controls.The difficulty of this game depends on the player's skill. You will die a lot die a lot when you first play this game. If you're great with platformers, this game will not feel as difficult; if you're new or not that as skilled in this genre, you're going to feel like this is the hardest game ever made. All the enemies and environmental hazards still feel like a threat even when you have upgraded Ori's HP and skill tree; environmental hazards will deal the most damage to Ori. After overcoming the obstacles in this game, you feel like you've accomplished a challenging task; it's quite a satisfying experience.9/10on the difficulty and gameplay.Lastly, the graphics and the sound/music are amazing in this game. Before writing this review, I was questioning myself if I should review the graphics and the sound/music in different categories. However, I find that this game has created a very cohesive experience with the graphics and the audio. Hearing the soundtrack is like listening to the story of Ori play out. Looking at the graphics of the game gives you the imagination of what the music is like. The content of them both are so well intertwined; the experience created from it is one of perfected beauty. I cannot say anything that is con of the graphics nor can I say anything negative of the sound and music. Gareth Coker did an amazing job on the soundtrack. Play this game and you can see and hear for yourself how a story plays out.10/10perfection on the graphics and sound/music.Overall, this game gets a 9/10 from me, but an extremely close 10/10. This game is near perfection and one of the highlights of this year. Buy this game and play it. You will not regret it."

Its as if Studio Ghibli made a video game.Beautiful art, fantastic score, great level design, a unique, fun combat system and a truly heartfelt story.  Ori may very well make you cry-- if not from the tale being told, then from the brutal difficulty you will experience in places. For a gamer vet like myself it is a perfect challenge, but it may turn off more casual players.If youve got the chops though, Ori is a must-have IMO, especially when it finds itself at $5 on Steam Sale.11/10 -- doesnt get much better than this!"

At this point. You'll know if that is a type of game that interests you or not. However, I must say up front even if you hate Metroidvania games. You'll miss out on something real special here.What I lovedWhere to start.. The visuals are absolutely fantastic. From the art style and direction to the quality level design. To the subtle animations making every jump and action feel relatively unique and as though Ori may well be in very real danger.The progression. This game isn't easy. Long, very technical platforming sections requiring precise timing reliant on enemy position and sometimes even crowd control. You won't do this on your first try, or your second. You'll need to be patient. A comparison to Dark Souls is easy but its apt. You need to take deliberate actions and commit to succeed. Early on you don't have many abilities. But by the time you find them all. Traversing the environment becomes a truly joyful experience.  Ori is so incredibly spry. The character feels as organic as the forest. And your movement along with it.This soundtrack though.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBVMUOmQLcMAbsolutely incredible and emotionally jarring. Proper recurring themes. Truly great music. Additionally the sound design is top notch. I went out of my way to get into a quiet place grab a pair of great headphones and let the game envelope me. I recommend you do the same.What could have been betterI have one caveat. Once the final objective is completed. You are locked out of accessing your save. I had heard rumors of such madness so, I spent a good while exploring until my heart was content. I highly suggest you explore before finishing.The GistThis is a truly rewarding experience.

Throughout my playthrough of that story and adventure, I shed tears in a few events in the game because of how impactful it was, and that was the first time I ever had tears fall for a game.The gameplay is smooth as butter, with nice solid controls which combined with solid and challenging platforming, brings amazingly great gameplay in finely designed levels for you to play and progress through. The game is challenging, and it gets more so the more you play through it, with more abilities and perks you will unlock to help but to also preform more of the complex platforming that's required in some areas, so the game is kept fresh throughout til the end.The problems with the game is that wall jumping isn't as solid as the rest of the platforming goodness, but sufficient enough that you won't notice its issues down the line when it's covered in more gameplay experience and future perks. You can't select what part in time you want to re-play after finishing the game, so if you finish the campaign, and you want to reply some section or restart from the begging with all your progression, you can't, you will have to replay the whole game again and so on.Ori and the Blind Forest is a work of legends, its innovation is its greatness. It is a combination from the works of recent Rayman games with its fluidity, in fact greater, combined with Studio Ghibli and Disney productions that are of the highest quality. It's as if all the combined powers and talents of those amazing studios were put into the creation of a game, and you get Ori and the Blind Forest, and I'd say the people behind this game are one of the most talented and imaginative minds of this generation, they have created a game worthy of being in a history book of awesome game legends, if there ever was a book like that. We now have a new studio that can compete with those top tier studios, in a form of producing amazing games, and this one is the first game of hopefully many others to come.Shamelesslinkto original post."

My Nvidia Optimus video card was running on auto setting and so we changed the setting after I had finished the game. If we had know this to start with, the game would have played much better, not sure why the controller played up. But I played the game again over the weekend and everything was behaving as it should. I will play the game more and try earn some final achievements then put the game to a close.Look if your a fan of platform puzzlers with a wonderful story to go with it, then Ori and the Blind Forest fits this description extremely well. Some people may not like these types of games, and that is fair enough. But I do love these type story platformers, even though I'm not the best at them. I will give the game a run for my money and enjoy doing so, as long as my issues with the game are resolved, and they are now :)But one thing I dont agree with about this game is that Third Party Utility thats avaliable, this is suppose to help people stuck in walls and get back into areas that lock you out. I did not need this, nor will I contemplate using it. So all I can tell you is with out giving you spoilers, is this is a wonderful game. I did not need to use this Third Party Utility at all, so to me it is not really necessary. Just make sure  you save your game, and do it very wisely. I copied and pasted my save many  times so I could go back and explore in areas that I  have missed. But there is 3 areas that will lock you out, and you cant go back to them. Also once you complete the game, you will have to start a new one, unless you have previous saves available. I had found 39/42 secrets on my previous game that was finished, and    now my counter starts all over again for the achievement, but I will seek the secrets out and replay for them, just for fun :)This game may not be for everyone, and everyone has a right to thier opinion.MY ORIGINAL REVIEW :Ori and the Blind Forest is a lovely game with a heart whelming story, but not for the faint hearted, I had many issues. One mainly playing in slow motion on and off, but I persisted. When the game behaved I was enjoying it, but when it was laggy and slow nothing we did helped. There was a file missing as I checked the game cache and that downloaded and all seemed fine. Then there was another update later which made my issue return, sometimes It would play normal and other times slow and laggy, this was very frustrating to say the least. Also my Xbox controller had issues not always responding as they should, and my controller works fine. How do I know, because it plays great on other games with no issues, just this game seems to change back to keyboard and mouse while in game. I have had crashing issues with the last part of the game and again slow motion, my son changed some settings and so got me through the last part in small window mode, I owe him big time for this, but again it was lagging but not as bad even he got mad and he is a good gamer. But I did the rest of the game myself, even putting up with the issues, and why not I payed full price for the game, I was not going to throw in the towel because of game bugs. But I persisted, with my son's help at the very end.Look this game really is a lovely game and I will call it my little gem, but it was frustating playing it in slow motion for many hours, but I must say it did behave about half of the game play time. So when the game behaved I played the life out of it, into the early hours, till next the time then It had lagging and slow motion issues again. So this tells me its not my computer with issues its the game itself, it has some miner bugs that need adressing in my personal opinion. Im not a computer wiz, so tell me I have no idea, and yes you are right I dont, but I know what I have experianced in this game, and a good part of these issues did not make it fun, but rather infuriating that I just want to throw the controller and computer, I did not do this, I took breaks and also closed the game.Look if your dont agree or hate my review pending my personal experiance then thumb me down I dont really care. But I had to be honest and get this out to you and anyone else that reads this. Make dam sure you have the ablsolute right specs for the game, I know mine are fine my IT son told me they are, so I believe him and the game did behave about half my game time. I got through and finished it with help of course, from my son in the last part.Look to be honest this game is really lovely, very challenging and tough at times yes, it may not be for the faint hearted,  and I loved this game. But the issues are my reasons for the thumbs down.My advise if you are intrested in the game and are curious, wait for a good sale and find out for yourselfs. But just make sure, as I said earlier that your computer can handle the game, mine did but struggled.I have a 1 and a half year old laptop with an Intel core i7-4700MQ CPU, a NIVIDA OPTIMUS GT740M graphics card, but still this should not be the issue here, I also have Windows 8.1 and 8 gig of memory. While I dont understand such specs, I do know that this laptop can play the game smoothly with out issues but the game behaved badly at the best of times and I pursued and persisted with it no matter what. Also my graphics card setting was set to auto, son changed this today, but even still I dont think this would have helped much, as now I have finished the game. I might go back and play again to see if its improved the performance, and maybe I can enjoy it better.Thankyou for reading and rating my review, how ever you see fit. I finished the game I struggled with it, I fell in love with it. But I also cant recomend given my game play issues. When these things are fixed then sure its a wonderful game, and if you love puzzle platformers then this is a really good one, but only when it behaves.Im very sorry for giving this a thumbs down, it really saddens me, because this is a lovely game if your computer can handle it and there are no bugs and issues. Look just believe me, what I say, other people dont have these issues but I did, so thats why I rated down. There are a lot of Ori fans out there and I am one of them, but the game behaved badly at the best of times for me so I have to warn you and let you know this. But the story is beautiful and in my opinion well written and not to mention the awesome music aswell. Goodluck with the choice you make with my review and getting the game.Thankyou for taking the time to read this review :)"

You can tell that the programmers, the artists, the game designers--everyone-- who were involved had their heart in it from beginning to end.It is hard for me to actually pinpoint what part of this game I loved the most, because everything was equally amazing. The story, the artwork, the gameplay, and the music is all so well-blended together, and clearly all underwent a great deal of iteration. None of the elements have any kind of weird disconnection one typically sees in games that were created by large teams.The only negative thing I can think of is that I had a screen freeze in predictable locations on some levels, but that was brief and none of it happened in intense moments, so I shrugged it off.

It doesn't bring anything new to the table (but then again, what AAA title does?), although this is acceptable because it is still a great addition to the genre.Pros:+Beautiful artwork and music+Tight controls+Everything from platforming to combat feels smoothMeh:=Storyline. It might be good, but I have a hard time figuring out what is going on. I honestly still don't know who Ori is, even though they are referred to frequently. Its fine.Cons:-They probably should have explained the interface better. After ~2 hours, I am just figuring out what the life bar is, etc.-Some platforming sections are brutally hard, IMO. Yeah I playedSuper Meat Boyas well. Its not that difficult bothers me as much as I found myself getting frustrated and wanted to just experience the game without serioues effort.Yeah its worth full price.

This is by far the most beautiful game I've ever played yet. The attention to detail is captivating, especially in motion. The environment surrounding you reacts to your every move, and the background parallax effect is breathtaking. Even just moving and jumping around is pure joy, thanks to the smooth and responsive character animations. The music is absolutely wonderful and fits the mood of the game at all times. The sound design is impeccable; I got chills every time I learned a new ability. The story is somewhat simple, yet very touching and memorable, and the execution is remarkable. It really pulls you in and motivates you to save the forest.- Gameplay -Ori and the Blind Forest is a metroidvania game, which means you progressively unlock new abilities that allow you to go to places you couldn't reach or access before. Backtracking never felt tedious to me in this game, because it's mostly up to you as a player. You don'thaveto go back and collect all the secrets and uncover the whole map, but doing so is extremely satisfying.What I especially adore about the game's flow is the absence of hand-holding. This is a game that respects your intelligence as a player and your ability to figure things out on your own. The game may guide you subtly, but it never explicitly tells you what you need to do. Instead, it uses clever level design to introduce new gameplay mechanics to you. It all feels very instinctive and natural.There's a simple but very welcome level-up system, with 3 perk trees that gradually improve your character's current abilities in a different way or add convenient info to your map. You get XP orbs every time you kill an enemy, and some bigger XP orbs are hidden in secret locations, so this gives you another incentive to kill enemies and explore the map. Plus, it improves the sense of progression and gives you that nice RPG feel of choosing what perk tree you level up first.Heck, even the saving system is cool and exciting. The game doesn't save automatically for you; you have to do it manually by lighting a kindle. This can cause some really intense moments, and it punishes players for being too reckless.The difficulty curve is also perfect; the whole game offers a solid challenge, but if you remember to save often, it's quite forgiving. Though, If this game is giving you a rough time, you should try collecting as many life, energy and ability orbs as possible before going to your next objective. These orbs aren't just fun to collect, they help you more than you might think!By the way, this game has no loadings, so the fun never stops and the sense of immersion is never interrupted.I believe this is gaming at its finest.

The main character, Ori is just so cute too!As far as the gameplay is concerned, I think it is similar in style to the Metroid series, which is perhaps one of my most favorite series of games. Basically you start out with not much, then get new powers which allow you to do more things and explore new areas of the map. You progress through four (I think) major areas before the game ends. You can also earn Ability points which allow you to activate special upgrades such as more powerful firepower and say, breathing underwater, as a couple examples. Sometimes the game can be quite frustrating because sometimes timing everything perfectly and such (for quite a length of time at some parts) can be fairly difficult...but in all honesty a game should be challenging, and it's good that Ori is to a larger degree than many games nowadays.As far as the story, for the most part it's told while you're playing (I think there's only a few cutscenes total) and the prologue segment had me in tears after the first five minutes (which is hard to do, actually). I don't want to spoil any of the story or anything (if it matters to anyone) so all I will say is it's probably not /the best/ or anything, but I have found it quite enjoyable thus far.I totally recommend it to anyone who likes oldschoolish platformers and/or want a game that is just in general very enjoyable and lovely to experience. Definitely a $20 well spent, in my opinion (for me, anyway). =w=TL/DR: 10/10 everyone needs to play this!!(May edit again once I've finished the game. :P )"

It is truly exceptional.We all talk about how graphics don't make a game. But I cannot help but praise this game's beauty. This is the first game ever to make me feel like the creator's vision made it directly into the game. I always sigh when I see a game's concept art and then look at the final product and notice  the huge loss in ""coolness"" specially in 3d settings. 'Ori and the Blind Forest' doesn't suffer from this, you get to feel like you are playing inside a hand-drawn piece of art. That's the only way I can describe it, you are playing within an artistic piece.Last but not least, the music score. This exceptional composer has sold me, I will be buying the album for this game which is just so perfect for it. In most games I usually just end up listening to my own music. I could not do that here, this enthralling score conveys so many emotions and really submerges you into the game if the rest of it already didn't.

The main reasons are: It is one of the most beautiful games I have ever experienced and it feels like a complete package from the beginning - and it truly is a complete package.The music, the look, the characters, the gameplay. Everything is as close to perfect as possible, and it is all pretty impressive considering I don't really like platformer games at all.The artistic vision, the design and the implementation of this wonderfully crafted work of art, is truly something everyone should get to experience. There really is something magical about this game, I haven't felt this way about a game in a long time. As a little kid, about 8 years old, I was enthralled by some of the cartoon movies that Disney put out, Aladdin comes to mind. The game Aladdin also had some of that magic of the movie. I felt really good when I played that game, when I looked at the art and the characters. Ori and the Blind Forest captures that same feeling in me, and more, since now as an adult, I have the perspective to feel the themes of the game in a much deeper way.I could go on and on, but really, there is no point. Please give yourself the gift of experiencing the awe inspiring audiovisual creation that this game is.

This is easily among the most visually stunning games I've played (though I'm slightly annoyed by the Windows 10 system font), and the soundtrack is phenomenal as well. The abilities that you gain throughout the game are really fun and make for some crazy movement options once you get them all. My only real complaint is that I'm not a huge fan of the design of the game's difficulty. Whereas in games like Metroid or Axiom Verge, you have a big health pool but limited save locations, in this game you have a very small health pool and are frequently in danger of being one- or two-shot to death, but you can save basically anywhere. Personally I prefer the former approach, but I could see other people preferring this system. That one complaint isn't enough to drag down the experience that much, though - Ori and the Blind Forest is a must-play for any Metroidvania fan - just remember to save often!"

What past games have been exceedingly frustrating to overcome obstacles, leaving me putting the game away for an undefined period of time, Ori has managed to pull the game together in such a way that the experience is enjoyable even when you're faced with a difficulty you can't seem to overcome.The people who put this game together are geniuses, to say the least.

Everything blinks, glows in multitude of colors and makes an incredible, hand-drawn impression of game's world. Locations are distinctive, varied and memorable. Animation is buttery smooth eye joy and the music sells the package with the seal of awesome orchestral mastery. All of those elements are at its peak in few climaxes throughout the game. Those sections, while very spiking in difficulty in comparison to the whole game, are designed and directed FLAWLESSLY. Those moments sell the game! Music pumps you up, world crumbles and spins around and all you are trying to do is to win a gamble for your life... The payoff after those sections? Cathartic.While story wasn't a tearjerker for me in comparison to experience of others, but I definitely got invested in the game's world. Highest point of the narrative for me? The main antagonist. This isn't your standard videogames fare so this is very impressive on this fact alone. It's more an spiritual adversary in comparison to very direct, down-to-earth ones we are familiar with. Eerie, dark majesty of Kuro is always present and used to the full extent in many points of the game.Those are the high points. Where are the flaws? The main problem with Ori is that it is ""just good"" in other deparments, like gameplay. Don't get me wrong, you won't be dissapointed with this Metroidvania's mechanics and the flow and controls will enterntain you for sure. The only gripe is that not many implemented power-ups, ideas for gameplay and combat are new and innovative. There are some, like projectile bashing and a manual save-spot creating, but others are ""just"" competent. Not oustanding, just good enough. Combat really could use some spicing up, since it isn't as engaging as it could be. It's downplayed and judging by design of other parts of the game, it was an informed decision. That's why exploration aspects, controls and physics of jumps/dashes are more than enough to fill the gap.But, that I'm talking about. Right now I'm in the middle of ""I just finished incredible game and I just cannot take on another after the impression of the last one"" hangover. And I'm not kidding you, I have Alien Isolation, Dark Souls and Talos Principle on my backlog right now, I just cannot make myself iup to push an ""install"" button.

This game is almost perfectly what you would get if you combined all my likes and mixed them into a 2-D platformer metroidvania.The aesthetic is a wonder to behold, and the graphics do an amazing job of capturing the look of an expansive forest with gorgeous, wet realism withjustenough cartoonishness to give it a look that's practically unique. The one thing you'll want to keep in mind though, donotturn off motion blur, it'll permanently blur the sides of the screen until you turn it back on again. I have no idea why, but it means you won't be able to see the gorgeous scenery in those areas, and with this game's graphics, you will truly be missing out.The story getsdeviouslydark, but it never goes too far, and it's told almost entirely through the animation and the characters' actions, which you will be contributing to during the course of the game. Sadness, joy, fear, wonder, humility, empathy, triumph, and unadulterated enjoyment all make appearances, giving the entire game a wonderful roundedness to the emotional experiences it imparts.The gameplay only enforces the story; as so much of it is told through the characters' actions, the tools you're given for making your way through the game shed light on the main characters' motives: to heal, explore, and to navigate the gorgeous temples. Unlike, say, guacamelee, where nearly all the upgrades the main character receives are fighting moves that just so happen to allow entry into new locations, Ori's upgrades are, with few exceptions, entirely travel-based that just so happen to have a combat use too. It's not a small touch, and it makes the main character feel like an evasive acrobat rather than an unstoppable badass, which is very refreshing.The map is actually useful, which is a great relief, and the collectables are just numerous enough to tantalize the average player willing to do some exploration without feeling like you have to be an insane person to get them all. In fact, there may be a few too little, but it still strikes a good balance. What is unfortunate, however, is that some are missable, as you cannot keep searching or return to the temples after activating the objectives at the end of them.One thing that this game does that is quite unique is that being able to save is a core mechanic in of itself, even hinted at near the beginning as integrated into the story. To save costs energy, a resource that does not recharge. When you save, you create a save point that you return to instantly on defeat. This makes an interesting dilemma: reduce iteration time by using up energy, or risk having to do more over again to save energy? It does not take long for energy to become common enough that this is no longer a factor though, so don't be put off--its sparseness early on only serves to really make it feel as though the main character is improving by the time you reach that point in the game.Either way, it matters little: this game has a wonderfully low iteration time that you can even control yourself no matter how you slice it, and doesn't berate you even if it takes a few dozen tries to get past an area, unlike games such as Fly'n. In addition, the controls are fluid and responsive andwonderfullynatural when using a controller, and there are very few instances in the game that are challenging beyond enjoyment--I can't even remember any offhand. It never holds your hand either, though, a trap that some games fall into. You will have to figure things out yourself, but you are given everything you need to do so.Some people might be put off by the easiness, but I don't think this applies to many people. When you are in a difficult area you are challenged to be at your best, and when you are not, the aesthetics of the game, fluid controls, and feelings of freedom at bounding and weaving through paths and enemies willmorethan carry it. Keeping in mind that no game is perfect, I would absolutely give this game a 10/10 in nearly a heartbeat.It also helps that Ori is cuter than a button. I meanmy god,seriously."

I LOVE a challenge, and I've heard nothing but positive come out of this game. I figured I would pick it up during the Autumn Sale since I had some leftover money. Though at the time of this review, I have NOT beaten the game, I feel I have gained enough knowledge to provide my opinion on the game.GraphicsThe visuals to Ori are, obviously, extremely stunning. The ""painted"" style of video games, especially indie games, is a trend that is usually frowned upon. Along with retro/8-bit graphics, these styles are usually disliked because of how overused they are in games. It's become a recurring trend and it makes indie games just seem like something else to make the Steam store seem bigger even though no one is willing to purchase the game. However, you'll occasionally run into a few that use these generic visual styles properly. Some of these games include Shovel Knight, Bastion, Braid, and now I can add Ori to the list. However, I think of all of these games, Ori actually takes the crown as the most gorgeous game I've played in that category. The entire game is stunning and I was overjoyed to have something to spam F12 at. Everything ties together so well, I would give the graphics alone a personal pick of my reviews worked that way, but, well, they don't.GameplayOri's biggest flaws seem to come from its gameplay. On one hand, the platforming is tight, responsive, and is really exciting. When it comes to being a platformer, Ori does its job well. Timing and quick reactions are key in Ori, and I'm glad for this. I went through a phase back in April of 2014, where I went through and played a LOT of indie games. However, I also bought games that were notoriously hard because I was a self-proclaimed gaming masochist. I love a good challenge, as I said when I started this review, and I think Ori's difficulty is fine to be honest. People complain of ""random difficulty spikes"" and ""unfair gameplay"" but I didn't seem to mind those spikes. They were there, but they weren't UNFAIR. It's a metroidvania game, they're supposed to be hard. Being the self-proclaimed gaming masochist I am, I'm used to seeing a challenge, or maybe I haven't encountered one of those spikes and I'm just assuming I did (look at my time played) but I'm still not complaining about Ori's difficulty. I really liked the fact that you could change the pace and difficulty of the game by making checkpoints. Where Ori goes wrong, however, is that I found the combat to be really boring and unexciting. It's clear that combat was not the biggest priority to the game, and that I understand. But in a game like this, it just felt weird and clunky. It dragged and I usually just groaned when there was yet another wave of enemies waiting for me. I also realized that it takes a while for the game to start to get really enjoyable gameplay-wise, despite how amazing the game did its intro sequence.StoryPeople have said this already, but it's true. Ori's story is basically one of those really sad scenes in a Disney movie. But I love it this way. It's not one of those stories that literally immerses you and has more lore than all of the Tolkien books put together, but it provides a simple (but slightly generic) plot that was executed really well. The opening sequence of this game is by far one of the most unforgettable moments gaming has offered in 2015. I don't want to spill too much and there's not much else to say, but this story isverydepressing.AudioI was really bummed when I saw that Ori didn't take the prize for ""Best Soundtrack"" at The Game Awards because the game sounded so alive with the music. Forests are full of life and wonder, and this game perfectly captured that feeling as I really enjoyed every single song. There isn't enough voice acting for me to critique that, but the sound effects are amazing and make Ori 100x more adorable.ReplayabilityAlthough Ori is much more open compared to other platformers, I feel that this game doesn't have too much replayability. If you play and fall in love with the game, then I wouldn't be shocked if you played it again nonstop. But this game just doesn't seem like the type that would make me stay until the end.VerdictIn a world where painty/pixelated indie games are taking over gaming, Ori shines brightly. Even if it has a few flaws in the gameplay category, I'm really enjoying my experience with this game and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to be challenged or enjoys Disney movies. I don't think you'll want apples after seeing this game, just a small word of warning!Graphics- 10/10Gameplay- 8.0/10Story- 7.5/10Audio- 9.0/10Replayability- 6.5/10.:8.2/10:.+Lively soundtrack+Amazing intro sequence+Tight platforming+Checkpoint system was creative+Simple and depressing story+Ori is adorable!-Slow, boring combat-Takes a few hours for the gameplay to become really enjoyable"

Ori and the Blind Forest is at its core a Metroidvanian like many others, but the execution is just impeccable. Never before have I been so awed by 2D graphics as here, this is truely one, if not the best looking platformer ever. It goes beyond pretty screenshots too, because nearly everything animateable is animated, and they feel so fluent and impactful that it really enhances your immersion in the world. The music is also of very high quality throughout the whole game, absolutely gorgeous.The gameplay itself is bizarelly smooth. I don't think any other platformer I've played can compare with the smoothness and joy it is to move Ori through the world. Again, the animations really help with enhancing this. Combat is not the most interesting in the game, though enjoyable, but given the relatively short length I never felt like it was an issue, especially when you get the super fun Dash ability!Many people talk about its high difficulty. I personally didn't experience this so much, but I noticed friends of mine were really struggling. For me, the difficulty was high enough to keep being challenging and rewarding while only very sporadically getting to the point of frustration, but with the great pacing of the game this was never a lasting issue.While this is without a doubt the best action platformer I have ever played, it is not without its flaws. While the art invites a great story, this is unfortunately not the case, riddling in boring cliches such as finding 3 elements and ""save-the-world syndromes"". There really isn't as much narrative to the game as you would expect from it at first glance either. The prologue and ending are the only moments where the game tries to pull your heartstrings, but I couldn't see either as particularily emotional. It also never dares to provide narrative content that is more challenging, unfortunately.Furthermore, the game is at no point truely innovative. While it surpasses them, the game clearly shows its inspirations, and at no point truely adds anything new to it. However, it's an example that crafting a game with such love and attention to detail can be one of the most impressive works of the last few years.I'm feeling a strong 8 to a light 9."

All of its elements come together just perfectly to create a truly cathartic reaction. Few other games can say they so perfectly blend story, music, visuals, and gameplay.At it's heart, Ori is a masterwork platformer with deceptively challenging puzzles that take an enormous amount of player skill and dexterity.  The creativity put in to these challenges is something truly respectable. Despite the challenge, Ori never feels unfair because deaths are always the result of the player rather than luck. Furthermore, the game gives you control over where you establish your reload checkpoints which allows you to avoid having to repeat too much content except for specific end of location events. Considering the number of times I failed at challenges, I was surprised that I never felt cheated, nor did I feel frustrated that I'd have to do parts over because of how easy the game makes it for you to do so. It doesn't punish you for failure, it only rewards you for success. This should be a standard philosophy for such games.Visually, Ori is without peer. The art style is exquisitely beautiful throughout. If heaven were half as beautiful, what a wonderful place it would be. The muted colors and numerous, vibrantly themed locations always ensure you have something new to feast your eyes on. Each location evokes a specific emotion through its brilliant art design. Players will find themselves unwittingly admiring the landscape almost as much as playing the game.The Music of Ori is ethereal and almost other worldly. it fits the visuals precisely, and helps to seal the mood. It is a powerful score that is carefully crafted in such a way as to not be overdone which is often easy to do for many games. The music never gets in the way, never betrays the mood of the environment and always fills the empty space that visuals alone cannot fill. Truly a wonderful score worth listening to even outside of the game. It is relaxing, powerful, and consistent.Ori's story is one that blends classic tropes with a unique setting. In short, it is a story of love and redeption. There are moments where crying is almost a certainty and others where a smile can't help but grace the player's face. One excellent and unique aspect of Ori's story is that it is told with very few words. One could say it is quality over quantity. Most of the story is told through visual ques and haiku like statements that grace the screen while playing. The result is a story that is powerful, yet not distracting. Rarely will the storyline pull the player away from playing. Instead, it is usually up to the player to fill in the blanks with their imagination, and to allow the powerful, emotional message within be uniquely absorbed by each player. In that way, Ori's story is unique on some level for everyone. No two people will experience it the same way, yet all players will find something truly cathartic about the experience.Ori is a wonderful game. As time goes on, it will stand shoulders above the competition as a true classic. Few games can achieve the level of brilliant cohesion amongst its systems that Ori achieves. It is a game that every gamer should play from start to finish. If more people played games like this, society may very well become a better place. Sometimes, powerful introspection can be had while being thoroughly entertained.10/10. Must buy game."

( am using XB360 controller )The visuals are stunning, and the music is amazing; the two together make for an amazing atmosphere.As of so far, I'd rate 8/10, simply because I haven't progressed even halfway through yet.  I'll update it once I've either invested 10hrs or have completed the story.------------As for bugs, here are some, and hopefully with solutions:Q1) Game things Xbox 360 controller is always moving right?A1)Make sure you put your mouse cursor in the middle of the screen, then try it.Q2) Frame-stutter / matrix / audio not in sync.A2) As for this, Nvidia GPUs seem to be having this (though I ( even with V-Sync and Shadowplay) have not experienced this issue) to fix it, make sure you go into the Nvidia Control Panel by doing the following: right-click desktop>Nvidia Control Panel>Manage 3D Settings>Program Settings>(find Ori.exe)>Now set all GPU stats to use your primary GPU.I really hope this helps, and as for the ""stuck on water [thing]"" (forgot name), I am not sure, but I'll try to get back to that once I've made it there.----------------Okay, now that I've completed the game, I can safely give a 9/10.The story is not very deep or complex, but it gives the game its atmosphere.Ori controls like a nicely fit glove, and the gameplay only got better once more abilities were unlocked (and believe me,Triple Jump is OP).The maps were fluent, and the 'escapes' were excellently challenging.And of course, the artwork and music, were among the most noticeable I've seen among all of the games I've played.9/10, would recommend at full price, would play again in the near future.EDIT: If you can't fix your bugs, then I'd rate it a 8.5/10, but since I was able to fix mine instantly, I can't really let it detract from my own score much."

But Strangely, I pick this one up from all great platformer game out there on steam.  The reason I pick this up because when I watch the trailer. I stun by its visual and music. Then I watch other trailer including prologue and gameplay, I feel more grow interested. It feels like there are all great things in there from graphic, music, sound effect, story and challenging gameplay. So I pick this up right away after the first launch. After finish about 10 hours play, I admit to say this game is absolutely FANTASTIC.And I also not the type person who wanted to review some game. It takes time to write since english isn't my first language. But I take my time to write this short review cause this game deserves it.Story------The game has some story cutscene as you progress through game. The story is about trying to restore the elements of nature in order to revive the tree of life after it has been attacked by dark giant owl. Although I think the story is kinda general but there are some emotional moment through the story will make you aweGameplay------------The controller is quite responsive. it has some moves you can do on this game like attack, jump, climb, glide, swim,  bash (like jump over) on enemy or projectile as you progress the game. All these moves require some thinking and good skill in order to pass some certain level. It will feel frustated hard at some try but eventually you get pass once you learn how. you also gain ability points to spend on simple ability skill tree for better experience during gameplay. The great thing of the gameplay that you use your resource like mana to create save and checkpoint. Meaning you can create checkpoint wherever you like except on some location.The game has no  Bosses fight. In exchange they did some certain level which you need to escape before the times run out like climbing on top before the flood of  water rises up. The best part of this game is that there are no loading on each map or level. It gives you freedom to explore. So you can revisit the map when you miss somethingGraphics and animation----------------Visual is absolutely stunning. The background is incredibly well drawn. Each location has different style and mood as you progress. The animation is also good and fluid. It makes the background feels alive. The main character Ori also has pretty well done animation. What I find impressive that the dev even add Ori has alternate jump animation. Overall this is truly the art that will appeal all the audienceMusic and sound-------------------------Music is by far is the key to make this game so good. Each moment, the music fits very well. Like the moment when you try escape. This is what make me like this game more. Without this, I won't bother to retry the level after failed on so many try. That said the music absolutely amazing.Sound effect probably is another addition makes this game looks so shine. like the big black owl stomp when landing on the ground, it feels so tremble. And also Ori has some cute voice when got hurt and surface from water to get air.Closing thought----------------------Although this game has no high replayability but when I finished it, No doubt this game will become the 3rd best memorable game to me after 2 other games, Okami and Shadow of Collossus."

One of the most visually stunning games I've ever played, while maintaining a fair but intense difficulty that rises as soon as you get comfortable with a new skill.The story is a simple 'save the mystical rainforest' type thing: vague and magical, but I think just enough content.  A few twists and turns, and I might have gasped and/or cried a time or two.Gameplay is generally just a modernish 2D metroidvania style platformer, but the end of every temple is a chase scene.The chase scenes are some of the toughest pieces of gaming I have ever done, one took me 45 mins, the other an hour.  Once done successfully they only take a minute or so, so yeah, I'm not great at twitch gaming but these are tough.You learn new combat skills as you progress, which allow you to enter new areas. You also have a light perk tree, but the value of some choices are questionable while others are OP.  Choose wisely!The level design is cool, each temple has some trick to beat it that usually requires the skill you learn right before entering.  Standard fare, but really well done.  I especially liked the gravity puzzle.Music is beautiful, like really beautiful, but sometimes I got tired of the same tunes, especially when repeating those damn chase scenes.But the visuals, damn they look good.  Hand drawn backgrounds, an adorable Stitch meets Ferngully type protagonist, and some really gruesome and frightening enemy design really bring the whole thing together.  There are glowing Avatar style forests, scorching liquid firepits, and great 'anime magic' style effects for the spells, attacks, and item AOE fields.Negatives of the game include the fact that the game can trick you into missing 100% achievement by ending the game before you have finished everything, and sometimes the aiming of some of the spells and attacks can be inconsistent.  That last one kinda blows since you will be using them very quickly, and need to chain them so little room for error.Overall, can not recommend this game enough.  It is pretty quick, maybe eight hours including my many retries of the chase scenes, and I even did a replay of it, which took even less time.  The aesthetic of the game is so cinematic and wonderful, I promise unless you're immune to cheese you'll love it.  The gameplay is real difficult, I definitely felt like I earned the finale.  Very satisfying to see the game come to a close, even though i just wanted to restart it.My score: 10/10 Must Play"

It has the exploration that I love from ye olde Castlevanias, but it also has a few difficult platforming sections that I love from Super Meat Boy. It has incredibly smooth controls and you can literally dance through the world once you mastered them. To top it all off, it has beautiful cinematics and environments.This game could've been a 10/10 with ease, but I'd rate this 9.5/10 for two reasons; there are at the time of writing quite a few game-breaking bugs which I find unacceptable for a 'finished' game, and there are 'missable' collectibles. The areas in which these are found will be left ruined or blocked off. This means that if you care for 100% completion, you might need to do multiple playthroughs to find everything. I personally don't care for this much, but it's nice to see the whole map lit up and I can sympathize with people who do.The final small thing I'd like to note is that it's not very long, only about 5 hours, maybe 6 for 100%. The replay value is quite minimal unless you're into speedrunning. It will be an exhilirating 5 hours though, so definitely well worth your time."

,Recommended,261570,15095378,"Posted: 28 March, 2015",all,DriveR13G27,"I have played Ori with keyboard and mouse on PC five times in total: just for fun (1), to discover all secrets (2), without skill points (3), under three hours (4) and deathless (5) - it's the best 2D platformer in a very long time. The following is an overview of what points I like and don't like about Ori and the Blind Forest:[++] = very good, [+] = good, [°] = neutral, [-] = bad:[++] soundtrack. Atmospheric, emotional sounds of instrumental orchestra are a real pleasure to listen to. I even died intentionally before the end of the Ginso Tree just to listen to the music a bit more, and the interpretation of the Sorrow Pass nearly made me cry, that's how good the soundtrack is. Probably one of the best soundtracks ever in a videogame.[+] graphics. Very detailed, colorful, varying landscapes reveal the game's great aesthetics, and the character models are beautiful as well. The performance is really smooth, too; I had no problems running the game on maximum settings on an ATI Radeon HD 5870 1GB on HD resolution (1680x1050 @ 60fps).[+] level design. Great level design rewards you for being an explorer to discover all the life cells, energy cells, skill points, experience points, map fragments and map stones scattered all across the giant map. These secrets will most likely require backtracking, but I never had a problem with that since I always discovered new locations and secrets on the way. Everything about the map is coherent and makes sense. You might for instance wonder why some enemies respawn occasionally, until you find out that there is an ability which you can use to take advantage of enemies and their projectiles to reach areas you might never thought you could reach. It feels really fulfilling to discover these areas and achieve 100% completion.[+] skill system. This game comes with some RPG elements, you can use your skill points to unlock skills for Ori on three different skill trees. To unlock the better abilities on a particular skill tree, you at least need to have unlocked all the previous abilities, so your choice really matters and affects your gameplay experience. Do you want to fire multiple shots at once, to collect experience points more easily or to resave in locations where you have already saved? Do you prefer the ability to hit four targets at once or a triple jump and better defense? (I would recommend the rightmost tree with the triple jump and better defense, these abilities are the best in my opinion, but again - it's all up to you.) In addition to the skill tree, you earn 8 abilities through so-called ancestral trees, which will not only help you tremendously throughout your adventure, but also make the combat more diversified, because you won't have to rely solely on your standard attack to kill enemies - you can stomp on them, reflect their projectiles, bash them into dangerous obstacles which will kill them instantly and so on. My favourite ability has to be the bash ability, because it can be used in a very versatile way and rewards your skill more than any other ability.[+] story. To be honest, I didn't pay that much attention to it on my first playthrough, because I was too busy listening to that awesome soundtrack, but later I realized how emotional and stirring, but also how coherent and logical it was within the game's context. You can skip the five ""movie cutscenes"" (but not everything, see below). I won't spoil anything for you, so I'll just move on to the next point.[+] price. You get more content from Ori for 20€ than you get from some so-called AAA-titles for 60€ and more. The only problem is the lack of multiplayer (but on the other hand, what should a multiplayer in a 2D-platformer look like?), you only have some meaningless leaderbords with people who completed the game the fastest.[°] difficulty. Don't be fooled by the cute graphics into thinking that this is the easiest game ever, it's actually really difficult in comparison to all the other 2D-platformers currently on the market. There will be some tricky passages that you will almost certainly die on your first attempt, and the enemies can be a real pain in the beginning of the game when you don't have the bash skill. I would love to tell you how often I died on my first playthrough, but I can't (see below). Regardless, I think I died about a hundred times. The last area seems to have enraged some bigger reviewers out there, and sure it is challenging, but it's also fair since it really tests how well you can handle the abilities given to you. People who claim otherwise either want an easy final level or have no skill. Do you like challenging games? If not, this might not be the game for you. In my case, I liked the challenge in this game, so I classified this point as neutral.[-] no post-credits play. You can't explore the world after you beat the game, you can't even select your save file to see how often you died in total. You should also make sure to collect everything you can before Mount Horu, because you won't be able to return. However, the creature next to Ori tells you just that before entering Mount Horu, so that's not such a big issue for me.[-] save game system. To save, you have to use one (with upgrades: half of a) skill point. When you need four skill points to open a gate and you have just mastered a difficult passage, you better not save, because otherwise you'll not be able to open that gate, you will have to backtrack just to refill that one missing skill point, which almost frustrated me on some occasions. On top of that, you can't save when you're near an enemy or on fragile grounds, but that makes sense in my opinion, because when you reload your save file, you want to be safe in that spot and not be killed by some enemy before you can even react. Besides that, I recommend to save a lot on the first playthrough, since there can always be some instant death trap a few centimeters away from you or a different unfortunate hazard like spikes which you can't get out of, so you'll die as a result (prime example has to be the enormous spider's web, which falls on the spikes below. I jumped down and was dead because of spikes I couldn't see in the first place, which was really frustrating). And remember, when you die, you'll have to do everything again from your last save: if you collected some secret cells or went to numerous locations you wanted to explore and then died because of an inconveniently placed hazard, good luck recalling all the places you've been to.[-] instant death. Without a doubt, there are too many instant death traps for my taste. I often thought that I have so much life left that it's not necessary for me to save, and a few moments later I was dead because of some laser beam or spikes one could not get out of, so that I got hit over and over again until I died. By the way, some spikes really are instant death traps, while others are not - that's inconsistent and confusing at times.[-] unskippable scripted sequences. You can skip five ""movie cutscenes"", but you'll have to watch the smaller cutscenes with text overlay, whether you want it or not. Yes, the story is really good, but on my fourth and fifth playthrough I already know the story, so I don't think it's necessary to forcibly show me them again.[-] rebinding keys. Though you can play with a controller on PC or play with keyboard and mouse (or keyboard exclusively, which I've never tried out), I have not found the option to rebind keys, which is just laughable, sorry. I prefer the arrow keys over wasd-controls, but I couldn't change the controls, so I had to get accustomed to the predefined control set. Luckily, I could get used to the controls easily, but considering the game's difficulty, I can understand that people who can't get used to them might get frustrated, especially when the assignment of keys becomes the reason for not being able to complete a passage (instead of the lack of skill).[-] minor glitches/bugs"

Ori and the Blind Forest is the rare game I can call perfect.The world map functions as a cohesive whole, with each area connecting seamlessly to the next. As Ori scampers, climbs, flips, hand-springs, and glides from forest to ruins to swamp to mountains, you gain a real sense of the world you are fighting to save. As with any Metroidvania, you'll gain increased access to this diversity of areas as you master new abilities. But rather than being a repetitious slog, you will be eager to return to those areas you previously could not reach. And the more you see, the more you realize this prickly, beautiful, dangerous world is absolutely worth saving.While the platforming is unimpeachable, I have seen some criticism directed toward the game's combat. Although it can seem a little shallow at first, I can't think of it as a negative that the fighting is the game's least ""deep"" system. Just looking at Ori should make it clear that fighting is not his/her forte. That said, once you have gained a good amount of abilities/upgrades, combat does become very enjoyable. While spamming shots is always an option, skills like Bash and Stomp can open much more exciting avenues. Why stand and shoot a creature to death when you can grab its projectile weapon, reflect it into another enemy, hop over, stomp the guy who shot at you, then throw them headlong into some spikes, all whilst boosting yourself ever faster up toward the next platform? The combat is only as ""boring"" or ""shallow"" as you make it.Once you realize that enemies can be chained together for speed boosts, or to gain access to areas that would otherwise be inaccessible, you'll see that combat and platforming are never truly separate concepts in Ori. Sometimes an enemy is better left alive than destroyed, and more often than not, the best answer is one that requires finesse, not brute strength and stubbornness. Ori's unique character isn't just a matter of gorgeously painted backdrops and tear-jerking cutscenes, it lives its spirit through its gameplay as well. And the game's evasive, fast-paced, high-flying, enemy-ricocheting style should appeal to speed-runners and people simply looking for a less violent platformer in equal measure.In short, this game is a remarkable achievement. Much more than another indie flash-in-the-pan with novel graphics. Ori is a masterwork of design and presentation, and is incredibly fun besides. Buy this game now. It is perfect."

Where Rayman lacks, namely story, it shines, while not being that far behind gameplay-wise.First and foremost, it's beautiful. The art is stunning, the music is wonderful, and overall it's very pleasing to all the senses.Gameplay is the area where it's hard to assign a single score.All areas are one huge seamless level and it's great, because it makes the world more real. It isn't static, it evolves as the game progresses. There're many interesting areas with fun gameplay. In one area, the ground keeps changing. In another area, gravity force changes direction as you move. But most fun parts, at least for me, are escape sequences where you have to run away from something or someone chasing you very quickly. They remind me about some levels of Rayman or Fly'n.On the other hand, killing very similar enemies which respawn the moment you move off-screen is annoying (in some areas more than in other, often enemies can just be skipped). Backtracking through the whole map to collect new items, because you can reach more items with a new ability, is annoying. Not being able to replay certain areas is annoying (will be fixed in the Definitive Edition). However, most players are unlikely to encounter all this — no one forces you to collect every single item or explore 100% of the map.There aren't any innovations, but it isn't something I'm after when I'm playing platformers. What really matters is fun. And there's plenty of it.The game is difficult just on the right level — you'll never hit a wall of difficulty, but the game expects you to get better at playing over time, to learn new skills, to perfect your moves. Expect to die a lot, especially if you aren't hardcore player (I'm not).(removed text)Nevermind, the story is touching. After playing five or so times, it still gives me goosebumps, so complaining about little details at this point is absolutely silly.For those who care, achievements are good. Some are story-based, some are collection-based, some are skill-based, and some are extremely difficult which very players can complete."

You really feel connected to the characters, like they are your family. The story is fantastic and you feel so rewarded after you finally finish the game.Visual: This game is one of the prettiest 2d games i have ever seen. The colors are wonderfully vibrant and realy make you feel the area that you are in.Audio: This game's soundtrack in absolutely beautiful 10/10 go buy it nowGameplay: So i've read through some of the comments here where people are saying that the game is gamebreakingly difficult. This is simply not true. The problem that they are most likely having is that they aren't using either their life or their energy wisely, as there are only a few spots where it will take you a large chunk of time to complete (the 3 towers). I managed to finish this game in 7 hours which i feel is probably on the faster side of most people. I dont play platformers that often, the only one i have really played is super meat boy, but the mechanics in this game were just a lot of fun to mess with. This game kind of reminds me of super meat boy actually but not the extreme that that game is. You will not have 200+ deaths in one area. The leveling system is interesting and forces you to fully explore the areas that you enter because you realize that energy, health, and spirit are your best friends and the only way to get more is to look in all the nooks and crevices. The spirit trees granting you new powers gave you an excuse to revisit old locations to open up new shortcuts and try to find resources. I played this game on a gamepad and haven't even attemted it with mouse and keyboard. The gamepad was a joy to play on and all of the button positions made sense.Conclusion: This is one of the best games i have ever played and that is saying a lot. I would definitely recommend this game to any one of my friends without a doubt. I think they could honest probably charge $10 more and i would still buy it. For a game this good $20 is a steal so if you have had any doubts about buying it rest assured that you will get your moneys worth."

But Ori and TBF does give an amazing feel for platforming through its extremely fluid mechanics. I personally loved the progression and feel of the 2D platforming (especially after getting the dash), each new ability adds to the game's feel.

The entire game is eye candy. Great animations and cutscenes. Enviroments are extremely colorful and diverse. Enemies are recycled a bit but I was happy enough with the variation.Music is well done, but I have some problems with it. Most of it sounds quite similar. What I mean by that is lots of calm atmospheric tunes and very little stray from that genre. Despite all the songs sounding pleasant and relaxing, I wasn't really hooked by any of them. The music does not attempt to emulate classic metroid, castlevania, or even zelda tunes. It goes full orchestra-esque. You will not find anything funky like Super Metroid's Brinstar, or retro and catchy like Castlevania's main theme. It's all sort of background music that does it's job and fits the theme but I feel like the composer could have experimented a bit more. None of the music ever made me stop and just listen for a while. I suppose one could argue that the composer was not going for that angle, but with a metroidvania game I feel like emulating different styles to try and give that unique platformer feel to each level is better than just making a ""one genre"" album for the entire game. I want to hear music that makes me say ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ I should download this."" Again, don't get me wrong. The music was good, but personally coming from a platformer background with genre expansive tunes, I wasn't that interested in most of the songs.Story is excellent. I don't want to spoil anything so I will leave it at that. I played this game drunk a couple times and that was a huge mistake. It's often very touching.Gameplay is very patience demanding. If you start to tilt you will find yourself continuously dying. That said it is very skillful and rewarding when you get past a difficult part. I often found myself swearing when I'd be at an intense moment and mess up. Sort of like the newer donkey kong games. Some mechanics of the controls aren't quite 100%. The jumping is fluid but not as much as classic titles of this genre. Players familiar to the platformer genre will most likely find themselves slightly screwing up an important jump just because it handles ever so slightly off. It's not by any means huge, but it's noticeable sometimes. I kind of missed the fact that there were no boss battles, only boss ""encounters."" There were mini boss fights but they weren't that noteworthy. With all the great mechanics to this game I was hoping the developers would implement some interesting boss fights.Game is awesome. If you like platformers you will enjoy this. If you like touching stories you will enjoy this. If you like a challenge you will enjoy this. I'd definitely recommend this game."

Its gameplay starts simply, but progressively becomes more complex as the player gains abilities and power-ups.I admired the unique ways in which enemies were utilized to reach goals; for example, using the Dash ability to richochet off of spiders, frogs, and insects to reach higher areas, avoid spikes, or even force enemies to attack each other. It is a platformer, but with a heavy emphasis on puzzles and mazes to proceed, giving it a very Mario meets Zelda flavor. There are even elemental temples to restore.I did find very interesting that unlike many games, Ori doesn't have many boss fights; even at the end of the temple dungeons. The tradition of fighting a guardian monster or agent of evil is mostly replaced by puzzles and plot, adding to the game's somewhat quirky, philosophical feel."

Ori is brilliant in every sense of the word, and unlike many of my favorite games, it isn't niche in the slightest. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone and everyone.I'd heard others describe the game as basically playing a Pixar movie before I started it. It's not the first time I've heard that said about a game, but this is the first time when the similarities went beyond the character design and basic story tone. Ori is a fundamentally lighthearted game that isn't afraid to venture into darker themes, and everything about the game reflects that. The music, level design, art, writing, and even enemies have a plethora of different tones, but they all come together perfectly to express whatever the game is saying at that moment. The story, for its part, never has more than 4 lines of spoken or written text in a row. It's overwhelmingly conveyed through the motions and expressions of unspeaking characters, and it works because of the remarkable quality of the animation.The animation's arguably more important contribution is to the gameplay, however. Ori's movement, combining flips, spins, and even airplane arms, is wonderfully expressive, and it combines with near-perfect controls and great level design to produce a game that's simply fun. Like all metroidvanias, Ori requires tons of backtracking, especially to get the secrets, but unlike all other metroidvanias, I never got tired of it. I don't evenlikemost platformers, but enjoyed just moving around in this game as much as Ori clearly does. Many similar little touches build up to an experience that dwarves the sum of its parts.Ori is, at times, brutally difficult, but it's almost always fair, and I never really felt frustrated with it despite dying over 200 times.I think that about balances out to a positive."

With an atmospheric world, fantastic gameplay, tight controls, emotional story-line, and sweeping soundtrack - it's sure to blow away many gamers. Developed by Moon Studios, Ori has back-tracking, puzzles, fast paced combat, and a story-line keeping you from putting down the game.Similar Games?Metroid Series (Open World and back-tracking elements)Castlevania Series (Back-tracking elements and combat)The Legend of Zelda Series (For story-telling and Puzzle Solving)PlotOri and the Blind Forest's story-line is one of the most emotional in 2015's gaming year. With laughs, heart-aches, sadness, fear, and happiness all rolled up into one 2D game, it's one to treasure for awhile. Ori, the last light spirit must go out and return the light lost from a great tree to restore the life of a dying forest and home. Kuro, the main antagonist, keeps Ori at bay as she tries to keep the forst blind and dark. I can't say too much without spoiling the game, but one of Ori's strongest elements is it's story-line.Gameplay & Combat**This game is best played with a controller!**Ori and the Blind Forest has fast paced gameplay and combat. SImilar to Super Metroid's gameplay, you will have Ori jumping around the map as you explore the giant world, Nibel. Gracefully jumping and wall climbing, Ori is a very fast and flexible character.Fast gameplay and movement requires fast combat as-well - Ori is occompanied by Sein, the light needed to bring back life to the forest of Nibel. Sein follows Ori and discharges light that act as attacks - get near an enemy and rapidly tap the attack button and it will damage the foe. It's not just repeated tapping to defeat an enemy, you can charge up Sein, dash through enemies, and even smash into the ground as Ori. Combat is fast, satisfying, and addictive - though it's repetitive, you'll be gliding by enemies and still want to take them down.Ori and the Blind Forest also includes a level-up system in which you pick up light orbs that act as experience points. Gather enough and you level up and get to unlock a new ability off of your skill tree. The skill tree comes in three different categories; combat, efficiency, and utility. Each unlocks a brand new ability that greatly improves (and changes) your gameplay and the way you handle enemies and the world around you.Visuals & SoundBy far the most impressive and best qualities of this game are the Visuals and Soundtrack. The art direction and graphics put into this game are outstanding. Each area, each screen, and each ""dungeon"" are created in such a gorgeous and creative way that will leave you awe-struck. Made with Unity, this game is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played.Being the most beautiful game ever, it's also one of the most pleasureable games to hear. It's soundtrack has memorable tunes and sweeping large action songs that will make you want to download the soundtrack once you are done playing. The soundtrack is my favorite aspect of this game and while you won't hear grand orchestra music, you'll hear wonderful simplicity that stems from the theme of the game and the area/situation you find yourself in.VerdictOri and the Blind Forest was my favorite game of 2015. After playing through the story-line multiple times, downloaded and listened to the soundtrack countless of times, and achieved every achievement, I can say that this is a must own game. Beautifully crafted, wonderfully sounding, fantastic gameplay and combat, and an impresive story-line makes for a game that you need in your library. While it is a short game (first playthrough will run you about 5 hours or less), it's a must own for any gamer that enjoys exploration, fast paced action, beautiful story telling and visuals, and a fantastic score. The game is not perfect, as it does suffer from some uneven difficulty (the game can get pretty difficult pretty fast), it's still a wonderful game. It has a unique save system as-well as you get to save at any point, anywhere in the map with the expense of some of your ""energy"". This allows for unique strategies and save points depending on what you feel is going to happen or what you may have failed at.Overall, you should get this game. Fantastic game and one of my favorites for a long time to come.Pros+ Fast Paced Gameplay+ Addictive Combat+ Lots of exploration/back-tracking+ Fantastic Visuals and Sound+ Emotional Story-LineCons- Can get difficult fast- Short Game- Not allowed to explore and unlock the remaining items after completion of the story-line9.8/10"

So here's my review of Ori and the Blind Forest.Where to start though? If it had beautiful art, that would have been enough. If it had solid controls, that would have been enough. If it left me wanting more, that would have been enough! Ori and the Blind forest does all three for me and more than that.So about Ori and the Blind Forest, it's a metroid-vania style game, which if you're unaware means that as you play the game you unlock new abilities and skills that allow you to visit places you couldn't get to before. Like gaining the ability to double jump up to a higher place or ground pound through an obstruction. There are some games that do this okay (Terraria), some do this really well (Shovel Knight), but Ori does it absolutely almost perfectly. Getting the little items and upgrades for my health and energy were challenging but not impossible which can be attributed to the excellent controls. Fortunately this game takes more after Castlevania more than Metroid and as such the opening of the map is MUCH more organic. It's not perfect, mind. there are some locations that close off forever and if you didn't get all the collectibles say goodbye to 100% completion. An intentional design flaw made to punish those who just can't deal unless they have 100% of something, which I'm thankful for in this game. If you're playing to 100% the game then you've obviously forgotten what video games are for.Now onto the controls. Typical WASD, space, shift, e, left, and right mouse key. At the beginning, all you have are these but as you go you get better skills from these spirit trees that make more of the game accessible and running around the map more easy. It's also worth noting that moving around is fun as hell late game. I found myself getting into a rythm bouncing off enemies and projectiles and super jumping through terrain, killing all the enemies in the room and landing on the other side of a spiked area completely unharmed. It's this near perfect mix of speed of progress and difficulty that makes it so engaging. It's got that Sonic the Hedgehog smooth as butter kind of movement.As far as game mechanics go it doesn't bring much new to the table except one thing, making your own save points. If you have enough energy you can make your own save location. It's not exactly anything more than a quick saving feature made less efficient but I thought it was pretty nifty. It is from these save points that you buy upgrades for yourself with spirit orbs that you collect from enemies and upgrade orbs hidden throughout the map. You have three upgrade trees: Utility, Combat, and Utility ++. Utility does things like double the energy, life, and spirit orbs you absorb. Combat is pretty obvious. Increase the power of your shots, increase the number of enemies they can hit at a time, etc. And Utility ++ is kind of a hodgepodge. You can tell they were struggling for a third tree because basic design law dictates that a repition of three is the most attractive. But Utility ++ is like adding a third jump to your double jump, recovering life every time you make a save point, etc. Also the skill ""trees"" are more like skill twigs at best. A single line for each tree, no branching, or choosing this or that skill. But that's okay. The upgrade system might be my least favorite part of the game but that's okay since everything else is polished to a mirror shine.I'm not going to talk about the story much because this is a story that deserves to be told by the game. So instead I'll give the premise. You are Ori, a spirit of light working to restore life to a now dead land. Some sad things happen some happy things happen. You ain't getting no more. BUY THE GAME!Now on to my favorite part, the artwork. Jesus William Christ the artwork. Beautiful, vibrant color, outstanding design, and the animation... just... there are no words for all the emotions this game made me feel through the art alone. The animation is just so gorgeous there are no words in existence to accurately depict how much I love it. You have to see it. Not to mention the sound design. I have never heard quite as beautiful a sound design as that. A lot of games treat music as just white noise not to be payed attention to and really only meant to occupy your brain. (Terraria, Call of Duty, freakin Borderlands!) I actually found myself staying in certain areas just to sit and listen to the music. And when you get to event areas the music picks up the pace and gets your blood pumping like crazy as you're bombarded with massive amounts of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and you're just trying to stay alive and you want the music to calm down and just as you're ABOUT to die... you make it out and this relieving music plays and makes everything all better. There were times when my arms were jelly afterwards. It's a game that engaged me and made me feel things, and that is miles more than I can say for a lot of other games like Borderlands or even Skyrim. (Not to say that either was bad) I'm even rereading over this and this paragraph doesn't accurately describe how much I loved the artwork. So I implore you not to take my word for it and instead go look for yourself.I'll go ahead and wrap up my thoughts with this. It probably sounds like a cliche at this point but I believe in one general truth with video games. That is that there are two types. The first type being one that was made so that the creators could add a new golden sex dungeon to their money palace because they have a product that they know people will buy regardless of it's quality (The Sims or any EA games or Call of Duty or Halo 4 and 5). And the second type being one that was made because the creators had an idea that needed and deserved to be shared with the world. (Bastion, Dark Souls, and XCOM: Enemy Unknown) And Ori and the Blind Forest is definitely in the latter category. So here's what I would like for you to do. Find about $17, go on steam, and buy this game. No. Stop. Don't torrent. Normally I'm okay with it, but Moon Studios deserves your support for creating this, dare I say, masterpiece."

I'm not very fond of platformers but because of how beautiful the screenshots were, I decided to bite the bullet. My initial thoughts were to blaze through this ""just another indie 2D side-scroller"" and mainly focus on looking at pretty things on the screen. I'm happy to say that was not the case.The game surpassed my expectations and was able to excel at everything that makes a game good. It is incredibly rare nowadays for a game that can make me want to keep going and complete it. One thing the game does really well is its rewarding gameplay, there is a great sense of satisfaction from making a difficult jump, solving puzzles and figuring out new mechanics. The game is challenging, but not too difficult as I was still able to complete the game despite not being very good at platformers. (It probably took longer than average at certain portions.) Movement is very smooth and well done, it makes traversing the map very enjoyable. There is a bit of backtracking needed to complete optional requirements which I initially thought would be a chore, but you gain new abilities and certain changes to the map make it so fast and natural to move across the map. Overall, the gameplay experience was just really fun.In terms of visuals, you can see it for yourself, it is absolutely gorgeous. The world is vibrant and full of life, different areas mesh up very nicely while being unique. There is a lot attention to detail and no assets are used more than once. Sound design and music is also top-notch. Gareth Coker has managed to a craft a beautiful and emotional score that matches up to different areas and sequences in the game, from soothing during peaceful times to intense when escaping death. The story was not hugely impactful for me but it is something very lovely that fits the game.I am not a fan of platformers but the developers at Moon Studios have created one that is so accessible and welcoming for me. Ori and the Blind Forest is incredible and will be one of the best games have I played."

The atmosphere of the game is wonderful.The learning phase is very well done and nothing is too hard at the beginning. Coming to ""Boss"" Scenes, this gets a little tricky. Arrows seem to bug out (pointing in one direction, going in another) or not be useable at all (direction of arrow can't be modified sometimes). Not sure if this is intentional, but it's these fights quite a pain as there is no room left for error.You have a learning phase throughout the lvl and at the end room, you need to put all that to the test. Buuut, as it ""bugs"" out sometimes, it becomes a little less enjoyable. The rest of the game is really nice. It's like these old puzzle games as a child that aren't too easy (as most games are today). All in all, this is one of very few games I would really recommend.

On the other hand when you made these difficult parts, the enjoy is really really big and you'll forget all the deaths just happened to you few minutes ago and continue in enjoying the game :)From the modern time games it takes character progression and skill tree, which is greatly balanced - very often you'll think, what skill you will need now and which you'll unlock later. As well as the saving system. You create so called ""Soul links"", for which you need an energy. But this energy is used in game for more purposes incl. the ""battle"" one. Great system :)Then there's its story about light and darkness, which brings you emotions and sometimes it really surprised me. It's a long time since I was looking forward for the end of the story (in good word meaning).And I like, that whole game is one big level, so there's no annoying loading. More difficult parts are accessible after you get some skills, so you won't get to somewhere you can't handle. Geniusly simple, simply genius.And chapter for itself is music and graphic.

76561198010932791,Recommended,261570,15099427,"Posted: 28 March, 2015",all,TheDanman,"Ori and the Blind Forest is among the best audio-visual experiences you can find in video games. The quality of the music and graphics is not a gimmick that wears off after a couple hours of gameplay, but an asset that continuously enhances the game and astonishes the player with unrelenting beauty. This aside, Ori is a by-the-numbers MetroidVania game with some lame level design but above average game-feel and movement mechanics.The Great-The Graphics: Every blade of grass and every leaf of every tree has a beautifully animated mesh distortion effect that make them appear to gently bend with the wind. Ori puts art assets in the foreground and several layers deep into the background providing every vista with a sense of depth. With all of these foreground and background elements animating, the world feels very alive. There was clearly nothing lost in translation between concept art and the final look of the game. Any screenshot looks like it might have been specifically handpainted. One minor knock on the visual side is the overuse of glow. Sometimes the oversaturated glow of enemies, health drops, experience drops and projectiles become indiscernable from one another.-Music, Voice and Sound: The soundtrack's central theme is gorgeous and catchy. The more suspenseful tracks add a lot to the mood of Ori's ""chase"" sequences. The echoing gibberish voice of the characters is also well done.-Game-feel and Movement: Navigating Ori through the world of Nibel is a joy. The simple run and jump mechanics are implemented perfectly and the accompanying audio-visual feedback give it excellent game-feel. The powerups that Ori collects on her quest supplement this well with standouts including the Kuro's Feather (allows you to glide and catch gusts of wind) and the super jump ability that is unlocked near the end of the game.The Not as Great-Lame Level Design: There must be 7 or 8 types of walls in Ori. There are ones you must explode through, ones you must hurl yourself at with a super jump, ones you must launch a specific enemy at, and the list keeps going on. One challenge of designing MetroidVanias is to make these progression barriers less contrived. Presenting the player with a ledge that they can't reach at the time, but later giving them a double jump to reach it is smart design. When the player gets the double jump they will immediately think ""hey I can use this to get up to that high ledge!"". Having a bunch of different destructible walls is poor design. The player will not know which abilities can break which walls intuitively and will not make the same connection they did when they got that double jump ability. Having the ""blue"" ability break the ""blue"" wall makes progression through the game feel artificial and contrived. Ori does this quite a bit.-Redundant Abilities: There are some fantastically designed abilities. The Kuro's Feather gets you through progression barriers in an elegant way but also factors into your moment-to-moment movement. There are some other abilities that feel redundant and are ONLY used to pass barriers and do not change the way you would otherwise play the game. One offender is the wall-climb ability which differs only slightly from the wall-jump ability. When you get the wall-climb ability, the game presents you with some almost cringingly contrived puzzles to prove to you that ""this is different from wall-jumping, we swear!"" Another offender is the ground-pound ability which lets you break through floors and not much else.-Ineffective Talent Tree: Ori offers some small amount of RPG progression in the form of its three-branched talent tree. While providing some motivation to collect experience orbs, this mechanic fails because choosing to specialize in one of the branches does not change the way you play the game in any meaningful way. Specializing in combat is fine but, since you have to do just as much combat either way, it makes that decision feel meaningless. There is no replayability provided by this feature.Minor design issues aside, I enjoyed almost every moment of Ori and the Blind Forest and would recommend it to anyone who admires visual beauty."

,Recommended,261570,15258441,"Posted: 7 April, 2015",all,Catellus,"100% credit to AuldWolf for saying it perfectly.:I'm going to miss this game.For me, this was one of the greats.It was like I'd entered a vortex to a parallel reality where gaming hadn't given into the mainstream; it hadn't become creatively bankrupt, desaturated, dead-eyed, xenophobic rot that one could complete in their sleep. Yet it had retained the best values of contemporary gaming form our reality. Fair, even-handed, challenging without ever punishing (it reminds me of VVVVVV in that regard).There are certain games of each particular age of gaming that stand out as being something unique. Of this ilk, I can think of Okami, Knytt, and Ecco off the top of my head. Though oddly it shares most in common with Ecco. Once you've got at least the triple-jump and the dash, the movement becomes so precise and fluid that it might as well be underwater. It's a beautiful thing to watch.I'd rather seek egress from this place and find that reality where this sort of thing is commonplace. I'm a soulsick old fart, I admit. I have an imagination and worlds within my mind, I'm almost nauseated by how distressingly boring the average person is. Their mirrored minds each mimicking the last in grotesque displays of abominable extroversion, as though that were some kind of achievement. None of them with a word worth speaking.For a while, playing this, my heart sang. I'll admit, I'm rarely happy. It comes with being introspective, creative, and intelligent. Sorry. Many people like myself have stated something along the lines of 'show me someone with those qualities whose often happy and I'll show you a liar.' Which isn't as eloquent as I could put it, but it'll suffice. What I'm trying to say is that this is a thing of rare beauty. I feel most entertainment creators these days simply don't care.And it was nice to play as something other than a human for once, too. I'm not fond of my species. I mean, if you'd experienced what I had, you'd understand. I'm mentally disabled, and physically too if you consider motor problems/the shakes to be a physical disability. I'm of a class of person so utterly despised and reviled that I'm wondering how long it'll be before we're all stuffed into gas chambers and flowery excuses are made of it. So I don't often relate to humans in entertainment.It's worse, too, that they're often toned, Aryan in appearance, flat, extroverted, and as one-dimensional, soulless, hollow, fallow, empty, and paper-thin as they are 'beautiful.' These are homunculi. Not so different than zombies. Just zombies that the mainstream masses find appealing. It's a sort of conformist zombie, a Barbie & Ken zombie with bleak eyes. That's what gaming focuses on, today, so much.I think that as our brains are shrinking[discovermagazine.com] we're just becoming more narcissistic, extroverted, oxytocin-pumped, and generally xenophobic. And when I say xenophobic I mean ermahgerrd it's something I can't relate to, KILL IT WITH FIRE. So it's quite an achievement to create something like this that all those people can relate to, where they've been unable to relate to similar things in the past.I don't know how you pulled that off. But it's quite amazing. Gives an old fart just a sliver of hope.But yes, I won't forget this game. I can't. It's today's Ecco the Dolphin. It's singularly unique, and it's unique in how singular it is. It's a thing untainted by what the mainstream might want, by what shareholders might desire. It's an alien, foreign, impossible creation. So it may not sell well, if that's the case, I'm generally sorry. We're kind of a crapsack species at the moment, what with all the greyscale serial killer simulators selling so well. So I'm sorry if you won't be able to make more like this.But I appreciated it. And I know I can't be alone. And I know I'll miss it. I'll come back it at some point in the future. Likely a year or two from now. I might make it a case just to drop in and wander around, like my yearly sabbatical into Uru: Ages Beyond Myst to see Shroomie.Well done, Moon Studios. I think you did the impossible."

Ori and The Blind Forest...With a total of 20h (oh and yeah i'll keep on playing it you can be sure) I think I can finally say a thing or two about this sandbox game.General Scores:-Graphics: 10/10 for an Indie, actaully better than what you could ever expect and better than many open world 3D games.-Story: 7/10 cliché, the usual hero that saves it all, yet presented in a remarkable and unique emotional way which makes up for the fact that it's so cliché so we might as well give it an 8.-Combat System: HANDS DOWN 10/10! IT'S STINKING AWESOME. Ori litterally keeps on gettin stronger by sucking light, smashing grounds and walls and chain-killing enemies better than Dante of DMC ever could. Unbelievable how they combined style to skills and all that in the combat system. If you focus a bit on gathering as much Spirit Lights as needed to get most abilities before starting the rest of the adventures and take 1h of your time to discover the new area called ""Black Root Burrows"" and get the 2 new skills... oh boy... ORI will slowly turn INVINCIBLE. Almost OP!-Gameplay: 9/10 on Keyboard and 8/10 on XBOX ONE Controller, mainly because the controller uses the analog and it isn't as precise as the keyboard, but if you use the arrows on the controller then you'll be fine. Though I must admit that I never enjoyed a game as much as Ori and The Blind Forest in terms of how fluids and impeccable the control is.-Soundtrack: another hands down. 10/10 without second guesses or doubts, big thumbs up for Gareth Coker and all the members of the Orchestra. I never thought such sublime tunes could be achieved by humans, every time I opened the soundtracks and listened... it feels like a slice of Heaven.And now my final opnion.I actually had this game cracked, I reached till the end of the Ginso Tree level, realized its potential, uninstalled the game, bought it on Steam for full price because it deserves every last penny of it, found my old game save, deleted it, replayed from scratch.BEST INDIE GAME OF 2015... and it still will be the best for many years to come, people should know and play this game, it should have advertising on TVs and all over the web.We hope to see more from Ori's Team!"

This feels like where games would have been, if 3D had not come and stolen the platformer's thunder.The play style is decidedly older school, with a lot of very challenging platforming jumps, respawning baddies, and a good bit of back-tracking every time you get a new 'power'.  Modern touches do help buff the sharp edges off of the formula though.  You can create your own save points (and will likely kick yourself more than a few times when you forget to), and you can tweak how Ori's power grows via a leveling ability point system.The real star though is just the absolutely insanely beautiful video and audio.  Vibrant, deeply moving, dark and menacing, celebratory, sad, and much more.  The story is weaved through the world, the music, the silent looks between characters, the brilliant flashes when a major obstacle is breached.  While the execution is not completely flawless (kicking you out of an area you can't back track to if you poke the wrong exit was pretty annoying) really this is absolutely one of the best games I've played in years and I would happily dive back in again just to show it off to someone else."

Microsoft Studios has molded an amazing piece of art into a two-dimensional platforming experience. Nothing assaults the senses. Instead, it caresses them with a beautiful soundtrack and a graciously painted art direction. The gameplay is as solid as they come, with every input and consequence very clear and rewarding in all of the right ways. While nothing is ultimately ground-breaking, the Blind Forest never tries to be something that it isn’t and as a consequence delivers one of the most satisfying adventures and stories that I’ve gotten to enjoy in a long time.The world of Ori and the Blind Forest is one massive map that is slowly revealed to you once shortcuts are opened or puzzles are solved, usually with abilities that you gain from completing the game’s four puzzle-like “dungeon” areas that tie into the story. If the entire map was revealed to you early on, it would feel overwhelming as the game is without a fast-travel system that could make traversing quicker for the player. There is hardly any harm in this restriction however, as with the growth of the map comes the growth of Ori as a capable platformer of her very own. You will start with a basic jump and wall-hop that gets you from location-to-location, but in time will learn to glide, climb, swim, dash off of projectiles and even triple-jump.As Ori, the player will not only need all of their finesse to master the platforming, but they also need to defend themselves against the variety of enemies and traps that fill the Blind Forest. The basic attack that Ori performs comes in the form of a “Spirit Flame” that hovers around her, which will automatically lock onto points of interest that are attacked as the player commands. The most basic attack is simply single-shots that chip away at enemy health, but through discovery and ability growth, can become a massive charge with a radius of effect. Ori herself will eventually become more than capable of defending herself with ground bashes and offensively-charged jumps, but perhaps the most fun to experiment with is when the player slingshots themselves off of an enemy projectile to reach new heights which can also turn the projectile back onto an enemy itself. You don’t comprehend how important this one ability will become until some time after acquiring it, but it is perhaps the most game-changing of all and is extremely fun to mess around with.The player will learn to memorize the map as they travel, including areas that were previously explored before you had a new ability that gets you to new heights or through a previously impassable wall. What this means is that going back to old areas to explore new possibilities is rewarding, as it should be in a game that has so much to offer once you know how to scale it better and faster than when you first started out. This feels great for the player is a great reason to backtrack to a place that you’ve already been. Using new abilities (like the slingshot mechanic) will open up possibilities that may not even click with the player at first. It generates a feeling of genuine excitement when you begin unraveling all that these new tools can let you accomplish.As the one doing the exploring, Ori has the potential to grow beyond just finding and using new abilities throughout the world. There is a minimal RPG element to the game in the form of passive talents that are spread across three trees. You gain experience that unlocks these talents in the order of your choosing through defeating enemies, destroying small pieces of the environment, or by discovering experience pickups (cells) throughout the world. Some of these even offer a straight talent point to spend immediately, which is another very tangible award for the player to find through exploring and experimentation. This ensures that the world and all that the developers hid within it is not wasted.The character’s capabilities grow and with them, the player. At the beginning of the game you will feel vulnerable and minimally capable of some legitimately challenging feets. But by the end of the adventure, you will know the world inside and out, overcoming challenges that have you wall-jumping and projectile-hopping like it’s all second-nature. The level of skill that it takes is easy to master as the game never overburdens you or gives you too much to be familiar with at once. The pacing is laid out thoughtfully and fantastically.The music and sound design are perfectly tuned to help carry the emotions that grow naturally through the experiences that the player will encounter. Intense gauntlets have a climactic sound to back up the urgency of the moment, long stretches of traversion give the atmosphere some relaxation, moments of very clear danger (like when the antagonist is right on your heels) keep you on the edge of your seat. Every jump has emotion attached to it, every attack has a rushing sense of urgency and desperation. The entire world is laid out very intentionally and every obstacle with purpose.This isn’t to say that Ori and the Blind Forest is easy, because it isn’t. While the game lends you every tool and ability that is required to get through the challenges that you face, the challenges themselves do not pull their punches. Quick reflexes and tight responses to the environmental dangers that you face become absolutely necessary to get further and further. The game’s save mechanic is unique in that it is triggered as an ability that Ori uses, called a “Soul Link”. You can activate a Soul Link at almost any time and place and will need to do so often, as death is often quick and unforgiving. Once death almost inevitably strikes, you are instantaneously sent back to the Link that you left behind. It can take some time to become accustomed to saving enough that you don’t have to redo certain segments of a stage or a challenge, but it becomes second nature within the first hour of playing. The best part of this is perhaps that there is virtually zero downtime after a death; you can jump right back into a challenge platform segment or enemy ambush with the same gusto as before.The story is lightly told through short cinematics that are often paired with some mysterious and mystical narration. The game gives no more than is necessary, often leaving it up to the player to interpret who or what is speaking at times. With the protagonist being controlled by the player, the main antagonist is brought into various stages as an obstacle or a temporary danger until a puzzle is solved or a conflict is resolved. The way in which the game narrates the world brings shades of grey into an otherwise black-and-white good-guy-versus-the-world situation that makes the antagonist relatable and worth sympathizing for. Ori exists within a world that has its very own ecosystem, which can be easy to forget. The antagonist has a nature of its own that makes sense within the world and therefore its own sense of what is good for its own well being. You do not get to simply desire its destruction, but instead seek to avoid it altogether.At the end of the day, it does my heart good to suggest Ori and the Blind Forest to anybody that is on the edge for this one. It’s a steal for $20 and is easily worth double. It rewards completionists, gives a wonderful experience to casual gamers, and tells a heart-felt story that can throw you into emotional hurdles that you weren’t expecting. I couldn’t be more satisfied with such a lovely piece of work. It’s a beautifully functional piece of art, a definite must-buy, and cheap enough to gift for somebody after you’ve been won over by its charm."
,Recommended,261570,15028314,"Posted: 23 March, 2015",all,Katana,"Ori and the Blind Forest has earned its stripes in more ways than one.The first ten minutes of the game are a heart-touching series of beautifully animated scenes between two characters that don't need a word of dialog; all set to a soundtrack that's on par with the best of indie composers. While technically there's a narrator speaking through parts of it in vague, riddlish sentences, it still represents a superb example of showing rather than telling.The game does not simply rest on some status as an artistic, classic-gameplay adventure though. You may have heard mentions that the game is hard; I don't rank it among Super Meat Boy's levels of masochism, but unique platforming challenges and coordination are some of the staples of its gameplay. This would be a lot more annoying were it not for an inventive checkpoint system; you can essentially save anywhere by using up one expandable ""Energy"" point; as a Metroidvania, there are also true save points that refill both your health and Energy. I really hope for the difficulty not to put people off; at the very least, it will make those reward moments so much sweeter when you finally escape the flooding of the Ginso Tree.Every room in the game always seems to have the detail of a painting; the fantasy wonder of a game like Trine, but seeminly almost all of it hand-painted instead of 3D (many times, it's hard to tell the difference!) With some of the game's more cinematic set-piece moments, it's almost hard to fathom the kind of work that went into the visuals. You could pretty much hit the screenshot button at any time and have yourself a new wallpaper.Out of the storytelling, animation, soundtrack, challenge, and overall cinematic presentation; Ori would be a highlight of the year for mastering just *one* of these elements to the degree they've managed. Had I known what I do about this game prior to buying it, I easily would have accepted a starting price of $60. As it is, Moon Studios simply seems to have a whole lot of artistic vision that they now want to share with the world.I have not even finished this game yet, so for all I know I might have more praise to share about the ending. I'm almost certain they'll manage another tearjerker on par with their prologue."

Not only it offers a unique environment with so many possibilities and different ways to move and act, it also gives you a gaming experience you will never forget.I've always been a fan of platformers but I'm also very picky when it comes to them. Some platformers tend to make me feel frustrated but Ori and the Blind Forest, even though it felt difficult to get through some areas, I never got frustrated. Its atmosphere is so relaxing and even breathtaking sometimes that it's hard to just stop playing. Rage quit? Never happened.I absolutely love the story. It makes me feel happy and yes, I cried a few times. It's simple but beautiful, and the game doesn't have too much boring cutscenes or dialogues, everything actually feels important.The game isn't hard to learn, vice versa, the learning is easy but not too easy and it's fun as heck! At the very beginning you already feel like a pro and at the end you're a master. You can make a lot of fun tricks with Ori's abilities and that makes the playing even more entertaining.Some parts of the game are so intense and they come as such a surprise that I have to give props to that. Those parts really have the feel. You know what I mean? They make you feel like you really live in the game, you ARE the game, and you don't have to worry about anything in the ""real"" world, because the game's world is your world now.Do I recommend this game? Hell yeah! It's definitely worth its full price and I'm also happy that a definitive edition came out with more stuff to do.

Of course as you will expect there are plenty of power-ups and skills, the leveling system and skill tree are simple but fun, every skill really help you out, I mean, there is no skill that you will feel is not worth spending your points in it. You really want all of them, and it keeps you playing and leveling up.Apart from that of course, there is the fantastic gameplay and how smooth everything is put together. Monsters are very well designed, each of them have their weakness but they can deliver high amount of damage to you if you are not careful or approach them with the wrong tactics.The 2D world is good, there are plenty of secrets and hidden caves to discover containing more HP, Energy, XP, Map fragments and even skill points. The design of the 2D world and the background are amazingly smooth, sometimes you will not even see Spikes, because they match and blend so well with the background, so you need to be careful out there. The difficulty of the game is just fine, it can be extremely hard at some point, for me that is fine, because I really don't like games that are too easy, specially this kind of games.What I like the most is the game saving feature, it is well implemented, I think that is a great idea to save the game using energy, that makes a challenge too because you can create your own checkpoints, but at the same time, you can run out of energy and not be able to save your game for a while until you recharge your energy, so you need to think how to manage your energy carefully.Unfortunatelly, there is a annoying bug in the game, that can cost your save data, and you may have to restart the whole game, that is why I don't give this game a 10/10. Regarding the bug, you can search here in the steam forums how to solve that, there is a player fixing save files at the moment, but no official word from the developers yet as far as I know.Score: 9/10-------Pros:-------Great 2D art, excelent graphics and sounds/music.-Good controls, at least on gamepad. (didn't play with mouse+keyboard)-Great metroidvania gameplay and design.-Excelent and fun leveling system, skills systems and power-ups.-Great monsters designs.-Nice story.Cons:-------Bugs"

This is seriously one of the BEST recent games I've played. I didn't know much about this going in aside from how simply gorgeous it looks, and for $20 I figured I'd take the plunge. Man, I'm REALLY glad I did.Okay, so first off, you're going to notice that the art is, bar none, the most beautiful looking thing ever. I want to say that it kind of invokes a Ghibli sort of feeling, but that's not really doing it justice because that doesn't even begin to explain it. The whole world seems alive with its painted style. Colors are vibrant, sounds are immersive, and oh my GOD the soundtrack is moving.It really helps out the story, too. The tale is emotional and well-presented, really doing a good job of tugging at the heartstrings without feeling too cheesy or tryhard. It isn't a particularly ORIGINAL story, to be fair, but it's just executed so well that it doesn't matter. All of the characters work really well, especially the antagonist. You really get a sense of dread and panic every time this giant black owl swoops down. It's crazy.Graphics and story aside, the game controls amazing. Moving and jumping around feels awesome, and each new upgrade you find makes you want to go back over everywhere you've been just to see all the new things you can do. Progression is smooth, and you can explore the game at your own pace or try to speedrun and probably have fun regardless. It's not an EASY game, either. Unless you really know what you're doing, prepare to die a bunch. It's not much of a problem, though, considering that you can save at any time just by holding down the corresponding button, assuming you have the required energy. You die, you're dropped right back where you last saved without missing a beat.That being said, I DID have one problem with the controls. There's a ground pound move you can do by jumping and pressing down. Fairly standard, I like the ability, but it felt like it was a bit too sensitive. I found myself dying more than once because I was holding a direction at a slightly downward angle, causing me to fall right into traps and get frustrated. I never stopped playing because of it, though, so it's not really that big of a deal.All in all, this was an EXCELLENT buy. The price is logical and you'll get a lot out of your money with this. Seriously; give it a try. You won't regret it."

,Recommended,261570,14888838,"Posted: 14 March, 2015",all,Kelgis,"Ori and the Blind Forest is a fairly short metroidvania action platformer, but well worth the time and money. The unique and gorgeous art style left me staring at the scenery several times, along with the character design, incredibly detailed animations and the wonderful soundtrack.The gameplay is solid, controlling very well along with upgrades that add a lot of motion and variety in combat. A lot of the upgrades are fairly basic things always seen in your usual metroidvania platformers, such as wall jumping and double jump, but their implementation is done very well, giving full control to the player and along with the great level design and a good difficulty curve, allowing for some challenging moments that do not feel unfair for most part. The few sections where you get no checkpoints can be a bit annoying, as you need to react fairly fast and often it just ends up being trial and error, although there aren't many of these sections and they provide a good challenge. The main problem I had in combat was just that sometimes, things would get fairly hectic and flashy and it'd be difficult to tell what is dangerous terrain and what are enemy projectiles, and what is safe. This didn't happen often enough to matter much, though.The game has a mechanic where it allows you to place save points at your own will, at the cost of some energy. Early on, you need to be a bit mindful of where and when you place save points, as your energy stock isn't very high and is also required for other things. But as soon as you get a few more Energy Cells to upgrade your maximum energy, you'll essentially be able to save as often as you want, which takes away a bit of the difficulty. But as you choose where to use these save points, along with some of the experience upgrades that can help with the cost of the save points or even make them heal you a little bit, it's up to you how challenging you want it to be.The experience/leveling system is fairly basic. You can get upgrades that assist with your damage, or upgrades that help gathering collectibles, or some other miscellaneous ones. If you try for 100% completion, you'll probably have almost all experience upgrades, if not all of them, by the end of the game. I finished the game missing a single upgrade.The map is quite large, but the world and its areas connect very well, letting you traverse from one corner of the world to the other fairly quickly, especially as you gain more upgrades. This is really nice if you go for 100% completion, as you won't be wasting all that much time backtracking to get to previously inaccessible areas. Collectibles include the basic things - Maximum health upgrades, energy upgrades and experience points. As they are fairly simple items, revisiting areas is only really worth it if you're having some difficulty or if you're going for 100%.The biggest issue I had with the game is related to this aswell, 100% completion - Two sections of the game are inaccessible after you complete them, so if you missed anything in them, no matter how little, 100% completion may become impossible. In addition, once you finish the game, your save file is locked as ""completed"" and you can no longer return to it, forcing you to restart the entire game if you missed anything. The game does warn you before you enter the final section, that there is no return after entering. However, there are no warnings for the other two sections and the point which they become locked also sort of comes with no warning or indication. This left me with around 96% completion all around, which was a little disappointing once I saw I could no longer access my save file.Overall however, Ori and the Blind Forest was an incredible experience, and is definitely one of my favorites of the metroidvania platformers genre, and perhaps one of the most visually pleasing games I've ever played."

All of these layers are animated and textured, ive cought myself looking at the background and dying because of it.The story is nice as well.The intro is very cinematic and beautiful and there are a few cutscenes to be found in Ori, but most of the story is told by the little light that server as your guide or a big deep voice that acts as a narrator. This never breaks immersion though, it always fits well within the context.Its short though,  i finished it in 9,4 hours (i did play a bit linear and not 100% completion mode) and leaves you very hungry indeed.I kinda with they had a  soundtrack DLC for this game because the music is awesome. It gives you this lovely fantasy night forest feeling and i love it.Im reading my review and im thinking: sounds a bit bland doesnt it? Im finding it difficult to express what kind of feeling this game gives me. Expect the feeling of MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE. This is a game that shows that video games can be an art form.TL;DR:+Challenging but not impossible+Gorgeous graphics+Gorgeous music- Short- No soundtrack DLC- At 20 bucks maybe a bit expensive for its length but i have no regrets"

A really superb example of narrative, artistry, and game design combined in a small but impactful package that takes roughly 6 hours to beat, maybe a little more if you plan on doing a 100% run. The storytelling is very simple but emotional, the art direction is vibrant with colors with incredibly smart design choices in lighting and perspective, but my god, the gameplay is what brings it together. Super tight controls with the awesome power progression of Megaman and Metroidvania-type games with level design that is both fun and rather challenging--but not impossible with practice! Though the adrenaline rush I had from my very first playthrough may not be the same upon my future subsequent playthroughs, I can definitely see myself running through the entirety of this game multiple times because it's fun and, goddamnit, it is an awesome ride through and through.Oh, and this is one of the few games in which I tried the demo for like 12 minutes (I got to play it before it released at GDC this year) and was instantly sold on the game.

Growing up an only child in the middle of a forest, these were my go-to sort of titles. A grand adventure casted with colorful characters, unique, sometimes frightening enemies, and varied, enthralling environments rife with secerts and danger in equal measure. I was honestly uncertain I'd ever see a title recapture the sense of wonder that old platformers gave me, then I purchased Ori and the Blind Forest on a whim.

And it runs smoothly on my crappy laptop , from 40-60 fps with v-sync turned on (you can check my laptop sys in my custom info box) This is what i love most.Second, this one is about the storylines and soundtrack. I was like ""instant feels"" after 2 hours of playing, finishing the prologue, combined with the soundtrack. To be honest, it's the most touching storyline i've ever witnessed in a video game, with the soundtrack, it made the game even more touching.

This game makes me feel like playing a Rayman game, with detailed and unique charaters, and with the gameplay tuned for both casual and advanced-achievements hunter.

,Recommended,261570,16720304,"Posted: 26 June, 2015",all,Boibi,"This game is a metroidvania. I like that a lot. I've been looking for a good metroidvania for a while now. This absolutely delivers. It has the wide open map, the secrets placed in every nook and cranny, the procedural power-ups and definitely the backtracking. It does it really well.This game also has some RPG elements. You start with only 3 life and 1 energy, but you can bolster that up enough. Maybe too much. More on that later. You also get ability points that you can use to add new character features. These include stronger attacks, better power up visibility, and better mobility, though the mobility thing is weird because most of the power-ups that you need to get are also mobility upgrades.The wide open map is great. It's laid out really well by the in game map and there are mapstones that let you increase your visibility of an area before you explore it so that you know what you're getting yourself into. You can also ignore these mapstones if you want the experience to be more surprising. I wouldn't worry about using them though because they don't reveal any of the secrets so you'll still have some exploring to do.The secrets are everywhere and range from a few experience points to life cells and full ability points. They're well hidden and fun to find. These make a huge difference in the difficulty of the game. Here, I want to mention a con. Once you have a lot of life you don't have to care about getting hurt. But then the game starts to introduce more instant death obstacles. I got to a point where I didn't care about any of the obstacles that weren't instant death. They felt more like a chore than fun. They posed no threat, but they impeded my progess. This wasn't too much of a problem because many times they integrated with the instant death scenarios, but it still got frustrating to get hurt when I could never die from getting hurt.Then there's the rush sequences. You know the part at the end of Super Metroid? This game does that a couple times. I liked them. It varied the pace of the game. But the rest of the game teaches you that if you see danger you soul link (checkpoint). These sections don't let you. And with all the instant death scenarios, having to start this sequence over for the 15th time can be really annoying. Especially so when you just know that you were right next to the end and you would've soul linked if you could've.The power-ups and the backtracking need to be addressed together. The power-ups increase how you can move about the world. You get things like wall climb, double jump, and charge blast. These greatly increase where you can move around the map. It also opened up secrets in locations that you had been to previously. Thankfully, some of these secrets were shortcuts. These were really useful for getting to previous locations to get those secrets that were just asking to be gotten. However, the shortcuts don't make traversing from the top left corner to the bottom right corner any less annoying. They have these spirit wells. Why don't they let you fast travel between them? It's something really small that could've made a huge difference in whether or not I wanted to go back to get those secrets. They even put the spirit wells on the map. Why?All in all, it's a great game. There's a lot here for fans of great art, fans of the super nintendo generation games, and fans of fun. My complaints are mostly nitpicks, but they're easy to change, and I'm kinda sad that this 8/10 could've easily been a 10/10.**SPOILERS**I also want to talk about the story a bit. This was my least favorite part of the game. And I think the worst part is that this surprises me. I went into the game and loved the story at the beginning. The first half of the game was very endearing. It had a very strong UP component. You'll see what I'm talking about. But as the story got near the end, it seemed like the story writers got cold feet. This ended made me mad. They just flipped on all the character development they built throughout the story. I don't wanna get too specific, but they didn't want a grey ending so they made it hyper happy. It bothered me.Okay, this is the heavy spoiler section. I want to complain about specific parts of the story. They tried to make us care for the big bad. They tried to make us believe that a mother would choose your love over her child. They brought back to life a dead guy. Everyone still alive at the end are presented as friends. That kind of thing made me not care about the fact that my friend died. That made me not care about the children of the mother. By trying to bring us back to happy, they made me not care about the sad they tried to inflict. This frustrated me more than any gameplay decisions. They actively made the story less impactful.**END OF SPOILER**"

A cute guardian spirit given the task of restoring a destroyed forest back to it’s former glory.Ori quickly meets a smaller spirit named Sein (SANE) --- who will serve as a guide, and defender --- while providing invaluable assistance for the tasks ahead.You, as the adorable Ori, platform and puzzle-solve your way through this beautiful world, acquiring skills as well as evolving your already existing abilities. Cleverly designed boss battles will occasionally bar your progress, and you will often find areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate skills are unlocked. This is all pretty formulaic for platforming, but the backtracking is never tedious and occasionally is entirely optional.What isn’t formulaic ---  though --- is some brilliant game design which keeps* the experience feeling fresh and new.The limited save mechanic could sound like an unreasonable restriction, but instead gives the developer the ability to be a little “unfair” with some design choices. You may be caught out by a cruel instakill section once, but you can spawn a save point right before your second attempt to ensure that the third, fourth, or twentieth attempt requires *the least amount of retracing your steps.I did not, in my playthrough, ever find that I didn’t have a save when I wanted one, However, I was inclined to take risks to find out what was ahead so as to not waste a valuable save, since getting caught without one could have left me in a truly tricky position..Ori and the Blind Forest is an early contender for game of the year for sure, but it is not free of small issues.The game runs silky smooth, holding it’s frame rate throughout, but some lag can be encountered when the game appears to be loading information during a transition from one area to another. This is a relatively rare occurrence, however, and it rarely impacts the gameplay negatively.The controls are another point of contention. The game demands perfection on a regular basis, and sometimes the controls are occasionally the greatest barrier to your success. The inability to remap buttons was particularly frustrating.The final criticism revolves around the game’s difficulty. The limited save mechanic combines with some very tricky areas to create sections you may have to repeat a number of times. While the current generation of gamers might consider this a “rogue-like” element, I felt it was quite charmingly, and infuriatingly, reminiscent of older generation platformers so it’s hard to consider it a true negative.That said, however, these are small complaints, and the game delivers on every promise it makes, including a perhaps excessively positive conclusion to the narrative.Moon Studios has brought us a truly wonderful gaming experience and merges it with a presentation that can only be described as a piece of art. Microsoft, as the publisher, seemed to stay completely out of the way and they have been rewarded with a masterpiece.Ori and the Blind Forest is available currently on PC (through steam) and Xbox One for only twenty dollars and promises you 6-8 hours of game play, more if you decide to go after all the secrets and collectibles. I strongly suggest that you play the PC  game with a controller.I can’t recommend this game enough and give it a very solid nine out of ten.Watch the video version of this review:https://youtu.be/mcpKxUeQhSg"

It is a game that follows a fairly linear story, yet allows a considerable amount of exploration beyond and beside the intended path. It is a platformer that presents intimidating challenges, yet is consistently fair and forgiving because of the life bar and portable save points. Most of all, it's an absolutely gorgeous thing to behold, and the wondrous atmosphere puts any other platformer to shame. You needn't take more than a cursory glance at the trailer to realize this.Progression comes in the form of powers and abilities. The powers are what you'd expect from a classic Metroidvania - wall jumps, double jumps, and a downward smash technique that obliterates foes and obstacles alike. They all have multiple uses in travel and combat, and the mid-air bash in particular is highly enjoyable and unique. Abilities, on the other hand, are more like passive bonuses that offer assistance in various ways, such as revealing more secrets on the overworld map, increasing your attack damage or causing collectibles to float towards your character. Notably, none of the passive abilities are required to finish the game, so if you're a sucker for punishment you could get through it without spending a single point on them.To figure out anything to complain about in this game would be a challenge in itself. Truthfully, it's about as close to perfection as the genre will get. If you don't enjoy Ori and the Blind Forest, it's because you don't like Metroidvanias at all, and that's fine. But those of us who do could have asked for nothing better."

I can't tell you how many times I was blown away by how epic everything looked. Expect to see virbant living colors, a wonderful sense of depth, and a perfect setting for whatever mood they're trying to set.It hardly stops at the visuals. The game has such a great soundtrack, so great that I bought it. The intense and sad moments are enhanced beautifully by the music.The gameplay and mechanics are well thought out and well executed. They introduce a mechanic at a well thought-out pace. Each mechanic introduced provides a brief tutorial, followed by several ways you'll be using it in the game. Gameplay is tough, it's easy to make a mistake. There are some sections which punish you hard for messing up, but that doesn't take away from the game. You're rewarded with a cut scene and relaxing gameplay.The story is executed quite well. You'll find that you really care about the story and really want Ori to succeed. The nice part is it doesn't interrupt you to tell you the story. They give small bite size texts to read while you're playing through the game. There are moments of sadness, joy, cuteness, struggle, and sympathy.The game has few faults. Immediately, I found the need for a controller. I died several times on keyboard and mouse, which I found incredibly easier once I grabbed a controller (Xbox 360). I try to utilize keyboard and mouse when I can, but in the end, I wouldn't play this game with it.The duration. Although I felt a sense of completion once I saw that final cutscene, I want more. I want more action packed gameplay and even more depth to the story. They bring you in hard with the intro and finish strong with a sense of wonder.Overall, this game put me in tears of sadness, placed me in pure happiness - where I totally didn't mind taking a swim just for the heck of it (I was literally smiling ear to ear), had my heart racing at the intensity, stopped my heart thinking ""Oh gosh, what's going to happen?"", and made me want to keep playing.Here's hoping for more!"

She adopts you and they live a happy life with each other until a cataclysmic event makes the forest and its food supply wither and it is up to you, to return balance to the forest.Gameplay: (9/10)Ori and the Blind Forest is set as a 2D open world platform game. You control Ori, a guardian spirit through his quest to return balance to the forest.The controls are easy to learn and precise, which makes it easy and fun to travel around the open world.During the game you'll learn different abilities (for example: shooting spirit flames and doing a ground stomp),you'll need these powers to interact with the environment  and to solve the different puzzles throughout the game.The game has save points scattered around the map (that heals you when you save at their location) but you can also save at any time in the game by creating a ""soul link"" but these can only be created using energy cells collected during gameplay.The cost of creating a ''soul link'' is not too high, but it forces you to create them only when necessary, at least early in the game. You also use these ''soul links'' to buy various perks and upgrades for Ori, such as underwater breathing and increase the spirit fire damage. Each skill must be bought in sequential order from one of three trees to allow the next, more expensive skill to be accessible.Level Design: (10/10)The levels in this game are beautiful and creative and in my opinion the best looking 2D game I've ever played.They are filled with secrets you can find, some secrets will be out of reach only to be accessible when you have learned the required ability giving you a reason to return to already explored areas.Visuals: (10/10)To be honest, the visuals were the main reason I bought this game. I loved the art style from the moment I saw the first screenshot and I regret nothing. This game is an aesthetic masterpiece and is the best looking 2D game I've ever played.* The Levels are beautiful and varied.* The backgrounds are stunning.* The visuals has a cartoony feel, but still have realistic undertone.* The characters are nicely drawn and animated (and ADORABLE).* The lighting adds that little extra making the environments look and feel more alive.So it doesn't matter if you are an artist like myself or not. I can almost guarantee you will love the visuals of the game :)The Soundtrack: (10/10)Soundtracks for me are important in games, it has the job to enhance the story and events within the game and Ori and the blind forest really succeeded on that part.The music is so intertwined with the story and does a really good job in setting the scene, whenever it is calm, sad or intense the music will hit you on the right spot and make you emotionally invested in the game and its story.So what is my verdict?I loved this game, the gameplay was solid, the story amazing, the music and the visuals godlike.I had a blast playing through this game and I will do so again, so I will give this game a 10/10!!!!!If you haven't bought this game yet, I highly recommend you doing so. It's a well made game and a joy to play through. I don't think you will be disappointed :)"

The platforming is superb, you move quickly and have fluidly. I would compare this game mostly to the new Rayman game, having similar artsyles and nearly identical movement. The only flaws i can see so far is that all the projectiles in the game have no indication of them being projectiles, and blend in with pickups like health and experience, and i often time get hit by something i didnt even see. Another thing i didn't quite enjoy is that alot of the traps in the game are instant death. When you die you respawn instantly to the last waypoint you set, and you can set enough of them to save after every puzzle or challenge. The only problem is, i usually dont save everytime i enter a room, and run forward to hit an unskippable cutscene, to be instantly killed 2 seconds later and now i am all the way back to where i began. The cutscene plays every time, and some of the instant kill traps are very hard to dodge. Some instant kill traps didn't even look like a trap, and i ended up running into it and dieing after clearing a frustrating challenge only to go back and redo it. The only solution is to get good which is not a bad thing at all. The story is nothing to write home about, but its enough to get the job done. Its hard to get a good story where isn't a focus on speech, but there is one nonetheless, and it is not a bad one at that.TLDRPros:-Quick, fluid, easy to learn movement and platforming-Amazing art-Orchestrated Soundtrack (although alot of it is ambient)-Challenging GameplayCons (very minor nitpicks):-Instant death traps-Hard to see projectiles-Unskippable cutscense"

Firstly, the controls, movement, and combat are tight. Movement is easy and intuitive. At just the right difficulty, you finish each part with a sense of accomplishment. It's not a slow platformer, you feel like you're going places and this gives you a sense of freedom that you don't get in a lot of games.The story  is a coming of age story, there is loss of innocence. It's not complex, but it's beautiful. It's childish in some respects, but it deals with good and evil in a very mature way. You get a feeling of sadness when you play this game, but it's a good feeling that I think people should experience in games.The visuals and audio are beyond anything I've ever played. Animations are fluid to the point where it's mesmerizing just to watch Ori hopping through the world. The backgrounds look hand painted and beautiful. The music kicks in at just the right times and the effects are sharp and spot on.It's Super Meat Boy in its gameplay, The Legend of Zelda in its story, and it sets a new stardard when it comes to visual design and audio.This is an experience that you should have."

Positives: Graphics, Audio/Soundtrack are an absolute treasure, superb, and just outstanding. Story and Characters: Great, packed a lot of emotion in between the characters that made really intense or emotional moments in the game. Mid-tier: Layout, Great overall, but kind of got bland and confusing in some sections, especially in areas with multple layered backgrounds. Content: Great once again overall,  but started getting repetitive in the end game. Negatives: Conclusion: Left me off with a cliff hanger, but not a very good one; the final minutes off the game were emotional, but you didn't even get to really fight a boss. Boss fights: I guess you could call some areas and things boss fights, but they were just reskined versions of the same one from area one, kind of a poor move on that part. Final thoughts: The game was amazing overall would probably pick back up again to try and complete fully next time, just kind of wish that the final parts of the game were a little more challenging especially the so called ""boss fights""."

,Recommended,261570,21184801,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,TheManko,"There’s a million things I could complain about in Ori and the Blind Forest (and I will), But I still kinda liked it. When the graphics, music and the general mood of the game is this pleasant, it’s hard to get too angry about anything.But to start the complainathon, the enemies suck. 70% of the fights in the game are against blobs. You fight blue blobs, yellow blobs, red blobs. There’re other types of enemies too, but the most common is a blob. Combat mostly involves you standing still and maybe moving a few pixels to the side to avoid projectiles. It feels more like RPG combat than something you’d want in a precision platformer. I’m just speculating here, but it feels like the boring enemy design was a consequence of the amount of time it took to create and animate each one to this level of fidelity. The four main characters in the story look good, but there are no big enemies or creatures, outside of the primary antagonist. The enemies work best when they’re used as part of puzzles, which is thankfully their primary role later in the game.Most of the work seems to have gone into making the world itself. In terms of artwork the levels all look either great or amazing. But for the first half of the game I felt it was holding back too much, which made it feel like I was going through the motions. Later on it got much better as the level design becomes more complex. But there are so many other platformers out there which have already done the same things Ori and the Blind Forest does, so I found many of the challenges to be bland. When you’re doing things like wall gliding, double jumping, anti-gravity and so on the game doesn’t raise the bar in any way. It does the most obvious things everyone else has already done, outside of one thing, which is the “blast” ability. With this skill you can use enemies and projectiles to hurl yourself in any direction you want. It’s the one good idea the game had of its own, and it does liven things up a bit.By far the most annoying thing in the game is the chase sequences, where you do several challenges in rapid sequence. I guess the intention was to make these as exciting as possible by throwing tons of hazards into the environment. But the result is that you have so little time to react, and there are so many hazards on screen, that you go into a trial and error cycle, slowly getting closer to the end with each retry. There are no checkpoints during these sequences, which had the effect of wearing me down mentally as I was getting closer to the end. After one of them, I just felt numb. There was no sense of victory, as the price to get there had been too high. This is how soldiers felt in WWI. You have to be lucky in order to breeze past on the first or second attempt. Given the style they chose for the visuals and story; I wish the developers would’ve made it easier.When it comes to the story, I liked the idea of it more than the execution. The opening scene does a great job of tugging on the heartstrings. But after that it goes off the rails. For what the story tries to do, it’s too thin in what is expressed during both game and cutscenes. Most of the time cutscenes only tell you what to do next, without there being character development, or foreshading or anything. That’d be fine in a different game, but Ori was aiming for more, and falls on its face. There are plot twists which feel totally unearned as they aren’t set up properly. At one point I started to feel disconnected to the story as I didn’t understand what was happening. It’s all “go here, do this”, without adequately explaining WHY. When the last cutscene played, I wasn’t buying into what was happening at all. It's the dramatic highlights of a good story, without the actual meat of it.But I’m not going to blame you if you like Ori and the Blind Forest more than I did. A lot of people seem to have. For all my complaints, it’s “fine”. I was just hoping for more, especially since it sometimes got very close to being great. Oh well."

I didn't feel victory when I completed those parts, I felt like ""omg I hope this♥♥♥♥♥♥never happens again"". But it did. I really want to love this game, but I can't love it anymore.Anyways, I am bad at video games generally, so for others it might be enjoyable. I recommend it, Ori deserves to be bought, and it is really incredible. I wish it was easier.10/10 for the ideas, the atmosphere, but the impossible parts make this game a 3/10 for me. My heart is breaking, it looks SOOO GOOOD, and I LOVED it soooooo much. Wish it was easier so I wouldn't have to hate it."

Within the first 10 minutes I shed a tear and did several times throughout the play-through.  It's an amazing game.  The controls are tight and responsive (like super meat boy), the story is one about love and revenge, the art is one of the best I've seen in a video game, and the music.. The music is by far the penultimate part of the game.  The game sports the right mix of challenge with a smattering of puzzle solving and exploration.  I cannot recommend this game enough."

From the open credits you are immediately introduced to the amazing sound track. The music in this game is simply amazing. It makes up about 50% of the atmosphere in the game and it certainly pulls its weight. I was wowed from the first few notes, right on the opening credits. The next topic, the art, is shown on the main menu. Once again I was completely wowed. Once you hit play, though is when the art really shines. The game seamlessly transitions from the main menu to the story and does so in spectacular fashion. Lastly, the narative. The story is compelling and told from a unique perspective.All three of these aspects combined with the spectacular gameplay come together to tell and amazing story in the best possible way. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone who even remotely likes platformers."
76561198120184109,Recommended,261570,20104567,"Posted: 29 December, 2015",all,The Dishonoured Wolf,"This game, very simply, is a masterpiece. It's easily one of the best video games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. I bought this on my Xbox, my PC, gifted the game to seven friends on my Steam account, and bought the soundtrack twice. If that doesn't tell you how much I love this game, then I don't know what will.GRAPHICS:The game is beautiful. Ten years from now, we'll look back on Far Cry 4, Battlefield Hardline, and Crysis 3, and say to ourselves, ""Yeah, they looked pretty good."" Ori, however, will stand the test of time. Every single frame is like a painting, vibrant and beautifully drawn. If someone ever makes the damning claim that video games aren't a form of art, then I want you to show them Ori, and prove them wrong. There's not a single dull area of the game. Everything looks and feels alive in a way that no other game does.MUSIC:This is easily my favourite part of the game. Every track is memorable. You will start humming along with the tune without even realising it. Some tracks are filled with action and adventure, pumping you up for the next area, some are deep and emotional, and to this day, almost a year after first playing the game, they still bring tears to my eyes, and yet others are powerful, like the epic scores you'd hear in a high-budget movie. This is the best soundtrack ever made. You absolutely CANNOT play this game without buying the soundtrack.GAMEPLAY:Ori and the Blind Forest does everything perfectly. Animations are smooth and detailed, the game is incredibly responsive, and with every new stage, you'll earn a new ability that makes the game infinitely more fun. That's the best part of the game; as you progress, you get more fun abilities to play around with that enhance the experience ten-fold. I've played this game so many times that it's become near-muscle memory, and it's still just as fun and magical every time. My record for finding every collectible and completing the game is now 5 hours, and I'm sure I can make it even faster with more practice. While it doesn't have specific difficulty settings, the game is truly brutal. Managing your resources and finding collectibles is tough, but trust me, you'll need all the help you can get. This metroidvania platformer isn't going to hold your hand.However, for the PC version specifically, I've encountered two issues: first and foremost, there have been several (not many, but several) areas in the game where I noticed brief moments of low frame rate. I have a rig that can run Crysis 3 at max settings and still pulls off 80-90 frames per second, so the fact that this game has ANY dips in frame rate for me is absolutely mind-boggling, especially since my Xbox One never had any frame rate issues, and that's only about half as powerful as my PC. Luckily, the frame issues are few and far between, but still hard on the eyes after so much time spent playing such a smooth game. Second, the controls are dreadful. This is the first PC game I've ever had to use an Xbox controller with. It's unfortunate, because I love to play with a mouse and keyboard, but because you're unable to map controls, I found it nearly impossible to play without a controller.STORY:The game has a compelling, and shockingly emotional narrative. Never before has a game so easily ripped out my heart and smashed it into a million pieces. Few games have managed to make me feel emotionally connected to what I was doing at all, and of those few, they were in a series of games, such as Mass Effect, Halo, or The Witcher. This game plays with your emotions in literally the first ten minutes. It has the strongest opening to a game that I've ever experienced. It's unforgettable and beautiful in a way that words can't describe, and finishing the game after everything you go through feels like the greatest accomplishment you've ever achieved.VERDICT:Ori and the Blind Forest is a game that rivals any Triple A title released in the past several years. As much as I love The Witcher 3 and Fallout 4, they simply fail to captivate the same kind of incredible feelings that come with playing Ori. With a story that assaults your emotions, gameplay that's fluid and beautifully exectued, despite slight dips in FPS and an inability to map controls, music like no other, and artwork that you'll never forget, Ori and the Blind Forest not only takes place as my game of the year for 2015, but one of the greatest video games ever made. For the people at Moon Studios, I want to say, bravo for making your first game one of the best experiences I've ever had. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's about time I save the forest of Nibel for the twentieth time.RATING:9.5/10"

I am usually not one to make reviews of games but this game truly deserves it.How does it look?It does look amazing and the graphics are just great. When i first got into it, it felt like a combination of a gorgeous painting and an animated movie (If you can describe it that way). There is so much to see and there is so much variation in the terrain.The animations are also wonderful and especially for cute little Ori :3 but also for the surrounding vegetation which makes everything feel more alive when you pass through the forest for example. There is always something to look at and it's beautiful.How is the sound?It is among the most beautiful music in a game i have had the pleasure of listening to. The composer has done an amazing job and has a certain theme for every area. At one point of the game it was so challenging that i got pretty frustrated and was about to leave the game for some time till i had calmed down, but the music was so good that it kept me playing till i beat the challenge.Other sounds also adds to the atmosphere of the game as the different noises in the jungle, the splashing when Ori dives into the water or the deep breath she takes when she comes up above the water surface again. All in all, the sounds are relaxing, realistic, cute and atmospheric.What about gameplay?The gameplay is fun as it is challenging where you have to think to solve puzzles but it also feels rewarding. Like most games it gets harder as the story and Ori progresses and the game will not autosave for you so always remember to SAVE! LoL.It also has the ability tree where you can spend your ability points that you get through killing enemies or finding special items. Im glad that there is an ability tree in the game as that makes the player free to choose what upgrade Ori will get next.What do you think about the story?The story is also something very nice about the game as you immidiately get feels for Ori in the beginning of the game. One of the reasons that i bought the game was because of the feels i got when i watched the intro of the game on YouTube. You know it's a good game if it evolves a connection between you and the character.You get to see some small parts of lore when you scout the wilderness and as Ori continues on her quest, but as i am one who likes lore a lot, i think there could be a little more to it. Like notes/pictures that some of the habitants in this world would have scratched down on rocks, trees, anything just to give you some extra detail of the world's history or just some short sidestories to read."

I only forgot one upgrade or I'd have 2 so I'm definitely goin in again.Yes the game is hard, I cannot deny this, but it is nowhere near impossible like the bad reviews suggest. I play with mouse and keyboard- that means I play with both left and right mouse button, space and wsad with tab being my map key and I think I used shift? don't really believe that last one.Regardless. The game makes you think. Watching one of my friends play at the Misty Woods' jump trigerred leaves made me realise that omfg there's another way to get through this. It doesn't change anything as his isn't easier than mine (It requires triple jump) but I hadn't even thought of the option yet.I shall enjoy watching him enter the forsaken ruins, the place that brought me a lot of pain and suffering...

76561198043787318,Recommended,261570,20534330,"Posted: 14 January, 2016",all,Zack of all Trades,"Zack of all Trades Review of Ori and the Blind Forest (PC) -Ori and the Blind Forest is what some people would call a Metroidvania (a game with elements reminiscent of certain 2D Metroid and Castlevania games, especially the use of upgrades to progress past previously unreachable areas), and it does its heritage proud. It was designed by indie developer Moon Studios and published by Microsoft and released in March 2015 for Xbox One and PC.There is a lot of good to say about Ori, it’s beautiful, and touching, but most of all it just plays well. What I am trying to say is that the game is a joy. It may not be perfect, but it’s darn close and it is one of my favorite games released in 2015.A tale of forest spirits:There’s not much to Ori in the story department, but what is there might cause you to get a bit emotional. In fact there is so little to the plot that saying much of anything will spoil it, so… Here’s the basics: Ori is a guardian spirit that fell free from the Spirit Tree during a storm, she was then raised by Naru, the odd, but motherly creature who found her. From there things go badly for the forest and Ori must adventure on to set things right. I can tell you that it likely won’t be the story that keeps you playing the game, but that isn’t a bad thing. It does what it set out to do and does it well, but it’s a simple story at heart. What’s really important is…How it feels to be Ori:The general structure of Ori is in much the same vein as a classic Metroid game. It’s a 2D platformer, you blast your enemies with homing ‘spirit fire’ and you gain a variety of abilities that allow you to traverse further into the forest. Ori moves very smoothly, the physics are precise and you sometimes might feel you are watching things happen before you remember your fingers are pressing buttons. I have heard some people find the game too floaty, but I most vehemently disagree. This general smoothness of gameplay is only enhanced each time you gain a new ability that increases your freedom of movement, whether it lets you cling to walls, jump higher, or dash through the air.Ori levels up as you gain experience from enemies and cells hidden throughout the map, each level up gives you a skill point to spend on one of three trees. One tree is combat focused, one gives you utility abilities leading to the much loved triple jump and the last (and most disappointing) makes more upgrades appear on your map. Why is this disappointing? Because Ori’s secrets are not hard to find. I am usually the type who needs a guide to find all items in any game, but even more so for Metroid or Castlevania games, but I managed to get 100% during my first run of Ori with no guides and no extra research. You may be disappointed by that, part of the fun in these games is finding secrets, but make no mistake, the series of jumps and ability executions needed to get some of the power ups makes you feel great.One sticking point I should mention, and one of the few negative things I have to say about Ori is that you cannot return to dungeons once you have beaten them. This means if you didn’t get 100% in a dungeon you won’t get another chance to. This is exacerbated by the fact that each dungeon generally ends with something of a chase sequence during which you can easily miss something. These chase sequences are likely the most challenging and divisive part of the game, there are those who love them and those who hate them. Personally I am of the former persuasion, these parts were a true test of your skills and all the abilities you have gained thus far.All in all I sat down to play Ori expecting something nice, but then I did not stop until I beat it with a 100% completion 11 hours later.The sights and sounds of a blind forest:While I can go on about the gameplay forever it wasn’t the first thing to grab me. What was you ask? The fact that the game is absolutely stunningly beautiful. It has perhaps one of the most impressive art directions out there. The style is reminiscent of all your favorite animated childhood movies, and may even pull those nostalgia heartstrings. Every area in the game looks painstakingly hand drawn and perfectly placed. Never do you feel that something is repetitive or non-unique. If you haven’t seen the game in motion yet, do yourself a favour and at least watch a trailer!I do not want to downplay the soundtrack either, everywhere you go, everything you see, is perfectly exemplified in the sounds you hear. No music feels out of place or poorly done, no sound effect sounds off. I recommend buying the soundtrack.Ori is pure smooth sailing in both the graphics and sound department, I have absolutely no complaints.Final thoughts:Something happened after I finished Ori that doesn’t happen to me very often. I dreamed about it, I imagined playing it when I sat in a boring lecture, I kept wishing I could play more of it. Ori has stuck with me and I don’t think it’s going to let go any time soon. It might be a little too easy at points and a little too hard at others, but it never overstays its welcome and you always want it back.Which is why I am so excited for the (recently delayed…) definitive edition! I hope to see much more from Moon Studios in the future. These guys have talent, and lots of it.Recommended if:-You enjoy games of the Metroid or Castlevania variety.-You want to play a Miyazaki film.-You like great games that will stick with you.-You are a human being.Not Recommended if:-The chase sequences are going to make you throw your controller… but then you should probably be in a different hobby."

The downside is, I feel like this is the kind of game you can really enjoy once. There isn't much of an exploration element to this game which is rather sad. I would have loved to have had free range in this game to explore more of the landscape. Nonetheless, this is still a wonderful game that I highly recommend players to try!"

,Recommended,261570,17109171,"Posted: 18 July, 2015",all,Lord Whiffington,"Truly one of the most poignant games I've ever had the pleasure of playing, partly in thanks to the spectacular soundtrack and a mesmerizing art style. I'm normally predisposed to disliking platformers as the genre has become stale and bloated with too much mediocrity, but Ori and the Blind Forest breathes new life for me, not so much through groundbreaking innovation, but just perfection in the tried and true formulas of the Metroidvania games that precede it. The complaint that there is too much glow sometimes is well founded and a legitimate criticism to consider, but the problem seldom surfaced for me and presented trouble only on a number of occasions I could count with one hand.Music/Graphics: 10/10The story isn't anything too complex, or great, even, but good enough in its own right and good enough to be carried through with soaring highs and heartbreaking lows by a powerful soundtrack that seamlessly accompanies the gameplay and does not linger. Many people have shared their qualms about a certain part later in the story that robs the story of its impact, and whilst I can agree that the cutscene cheapened some of the emotions built up from earlier, it did not devolve into cheesiness and no groans nor eye-rolling occured. Perhaps some explanation regardingthe Water Vein that Gumo used to revive Naruwould have been nice.Story: 8/10Gameplay is smooth and responsive and a joy to experience. Difficulty wise, the game suddenly becomes wildly difficult at the first escape sequence; though there was much fun to be had in the twenty hefty minutes it took for me to complete it, I can see that being a complaint when the hours preceding it was practically a walk in the park. As for me, the difficulty was a welcome change from the handholding many games these days are predilected to doing, which I find borderline patronizing sometimes. As always, YMMV, however. The transitions for the other escape sequences were much smoother and handled better.Gameplay: 9/10Conclusively, with a personal aggregate rating of 9.5/10, I would most definitely recommend this game to anybody at its current price (even better on sale for sure) unless they dislike platformers more than I do, or have a lower tolerance threshold on the Cheese-O-Meter, or just really hate being emotionally manipulated by some of the cutest, cuddliest characters the gaming industry has ever seen. If you don't fit into any of those categories, then I strongly suggest you pick up this game and treat yourself to this spectacle of a game.I wish I could go back and experience this all for the first time again."

The gameplay mechanics are very well-done, and the game remains challenging throughout. Definitely one of the best platformers I've played. Get this game, it's worth every penny.

Except the gameplay ISN'T awful. It has tight controls, fun abilities and evokes a wonderous sense of exploration. It isn't exactly an easy game, and some parts can be a little frustrating, but never enough that I even considered quitting.

Neat trick - 2D elements for a 2D platformer in a 3D environment means that the 'sprites' can have delicious levels of detail and movement without demanding a lot from your PC.Delightful music.  I would deliberately fail some of the timed segments just to keep listening to the track.  I've never heard of Gareth Coker before, but his work in this will sell whatever he works on next.  Already paid for the sountrack - downloading it now.Loveable characters.  Especially like the way the voices were rendered.  Story is there, but doesn't dominate gameplay.  Also, feels.  Lots of feels.Solid gameplay.  Movement and abilities are organic and smooth, this is exactly how a platformer should play.In hindsight, certain story developments feel a little cheap and the story's ending doesn't do its beginning justice.  Still very enjoyable, though.Update:The “Villain Most In Need of a Hug” AwardNot going to lie, I originally had Undertale slated to win this one, but it’s far more deserving of the Maximum Feels award and this is a fairly weak category by comparison. Actually, by and large it’s difficult for me to think of many games that qualify for this one at all, so it’s a shame to have to nominate Ori and the Blind Forest because the game itself is actually very well crafted. I couldn’t say at what point in development the writers decided that Kuro’s motivation should be having chicks that were fatally allergic to Spirit Tree light, but it sure would have been nice if they could have thought of something that didn’t make Ori’s guardian ancestor a child murderer."

You can save at any time when you are in a safe spot provided you have the energy for which can modulate th difficulty even more.Ori (the player character) is extremely quick and nimble though a bit on the frail side especially at the beginning but during your playthrough you learn many different skills and you also have a leveling system in which you can put ability points you get through killing enemies and collecting spirit light scattered accross the world to increase the efficiency of your skills. The controls are great and responsive.Then the environment (graphics, story and music) :This is where the game turns from great to masterpiece. The Art style of the game is simply marvelous to look at and although the overall setting is the same forest, each zone feels different and is very pleasing to look at. The story is full of emotion from the very start of the game. The first ten minutes will imediatly immerse you within the game world and the main character Ori and as you progress through the game, you'll empathise more and more with every characters (yes even the main antagonist). All of this is accompanied with a extremely beautiful orchestrated soundtrack that amplify the already strong emotions of the game.Overall this game is extremely beautiful and challenging and well worth its price (heck i would have paid more if i could for this game)"

76561198201014223,Recommended,261570,20258861,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,furbleburble,"This is my first review.  I'm thinking about doing more.  I'm not one for a number system, it always feels arbitrary and/or contrived.  Constructive feedback is welcome.TLDR: Buy it already.  Seriously.Intro:I stumbled across Ori and the Blind Forest while I was randomly searching through games on Steam.  The picture I saw for this game seemed pretty cute so I decided to check it out.  As I was doing so I was reminded a lot of the Rayman series, particularly the 2D games, all of which which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I found the artwork and the videos on the store page for Ori to be quite beautiful.  Out of reminiscence for Rayman, the beauty of what I was seeing, and the Overwhelmingly Positive reviews, I decided to get it.  I was not disappointed.  After completing the game, I don't think a comparison to Rayman is inappropriate, but it may not be the most appropriate.During the course of this review I will try to give enough information about the game but not spoil anything.Review:Graphics:Simply gorgeous.  The screenshots and videos do not lie.  The game is beautiful.  I did suffer some lag though, but nothing game-breaking.  My specs are listed further down.Sound:The music is pretty, and added to the feel and mood of the game.  The sounds are nice enough, I can't recall anything that made my ears ache.  I don't know what else to say on this point.There is no discernible language in this game even though there is speaking, sort of.  It's a made up language, but it's presented in a likeable manner.  There's also very little of it.  Only a few lines here and there.  Dialog is shown on screen in English (or presumably in one of the other supported languages) and the game is paused during this.  Nothing is taken away from the game through this technique.Gameplay and Controls:I used keyboard and mouse with no issue at all.  I found the controls are very accessible and intuitive.  The store page says ""Full Controller Support"" which I can't speak of, I generally don't use controllers.It's a 2D platformer.  For the most part I found the game easy enough, but there were times when the difficulty was ""punch-the-monitor"" difficult.  There are some ""run-for-your-life"" sequences that were quite difficult.  Depending on your skill level, those sequences can take maybe 20 or so tries (each), like for me, or, as I've read on the forums for this game, potentially dozens of tries.I had roughly 360 deaths by the time I beat the game.  Most of those, probably 2/3, were my own fault, just running along merrily and then misjumping into deadly terrain, or running into an enemy I didn't see, or forgetting how to play and I just stand there taking damage until dead (because I do that kind of thing), or running into a laser and forgetting to jump, or because food.  So, I would say probably about 120 of those deaths were related to difficulty, and 60-80 of the 120 were from the ""run-for-your-life"" sequences.  Given that, I don't think it detracted from the game at all, it just got extremely frustrating at times, like during the ""run-for-your-life"" sequences.You can gain health, power, and ability upgrades along the way.  Many of them are in secret areas.  You can also acquire ability points through the combat system.  You can learn skills through the use of ability points, and you can gain certain skills through story advancement.  I didn't find any of the story skills to be arbitrary or useless, and I had a hard time deciding in what order to purchase skills because they all seemed useful though some more than others.  There is an achievement for beating the game without purchasing skills, but I believe that to be for advanced players.Story:It's a beautiful story about the power of love and how we should treat each other with kindness.  I was quite moved by it, despite its overall simplicity.Achievements:There are plenty of them.  I'm pretty sure some will go unachieved for most people, such as the one for not dying.  I also think a few of them are bugged, I'm pretty sure I got a few to show on screen but do not show properly on my achievement list.  I could be wrong, but I don't think so.  There may be a solution to this but I have not looked into it, I'm not an achievement hunter so I'm not concerned about it.  Still, would be nice to have the credit I deserve.DLC: I do not own any DLC for this game as of writing this review and cannot provide an opinion for any.My Specs (at the time of review):Vista Home Premium SP 2 64 bitGeForce GTX 750 TIAMD Phenom 9550 Quad-Core 2.2 GHz6 Gigs system ramDirectX 11Conclusion:Regardless of your personal skill level, it's worth giving this game a shot.  I bought it on sale for $11.99 but I think it's worth the full price of $19.99.  I am definitely looking forward to another Ori game.  I highly recommend this wonderful piece of art."

The character designs, the voices, music and visuals gripped me from the beginning, and kept me going throughout wanting more. While the objective to restore the forest is quite simple, the level designs are so well made and challenging that I was so hooked that I finished the game within a couple of days.The character designs are so beautiful, and I have to say adorable. Especially in Ori's case. The theme of forest spirits, nature and life really speaks to me, and the characters were so expressive and compelling even though half of them don't even speak.The story is simple, but really excels in showing the emotional connection between the characters, even the villain. Though I like the fact that the ""villain"" isn't evil, just a character with tragic circumstances of their own.The soundtrack and environments are so memorable that at times I would be content just to stare at the wide expanses and admire the love and work from the developers and artists.Progression is very fast but each ability allows you to navigate the environment in more ways, eventually allowing you to travel nearly anywhere you want, even upwards. Ori is so agile that traversing long distances and navigating the world map from one end to the other is not so difficult as you might imagine.A couple of things I would like to mention, though. I would have liked the ability to fast travel between Spiriti Wells. Even though I didn't really need it, it would have helped for anyone to navigate the world map to return to areas and pick up all the collectibles. The other is that I could have gotten a little bit more explanation as to how the ""Light"" works, as it drives the entire plot from the beginning.All in all, if you like platformers, nature, fantasy, exploration, an emotional story, great game design, or a challenge, this game offers it.

Or ability to go back into an old save game.I HATE PLATFORMERS. I HAAAATTEEEEE THEM.These days, there's a LOT of ridiculous games on steam...and especially a lot of lame platformers. It's gotten so bad until even beautiful visuals are no promise either; far from it in fact. For some reason, iOS devs think as long as the game looks good, then boring, dunce-like gameplay is fine. The lame part is how people constantly fall for this garbage.Enter Ori & The Blind Forest:This is hands-down THE MOST beautiful hand-drawn platformer in existance. Trust me...I've done the research. The only game perhaps coming close is Odin Sphere or King's Crown. Dust: An Elysian Tale are close, but clearly second to the level of polish this game has. Pretend Meat Boy & Portal had a kid who decided to go off to college to do his own thing, but still kinda listens to his parents while he's away -- that's EXACTLY this game. The controls are fluid/soft, yet tight & the platforming has some instances where you need to think a bit more laterally than you otherwise would. Nothing as crazy as portal (despite having a fun portal section), but certainly some very refreshing mechanics to take note of.This game isn't a pushover, but it's not hard either. It's moreso a moderate mini-puzzle platformer. A great game to relax with and unwind, while still getting the same pleasure you would from a ""more complicated"" game. Further complimented by an INCREDIBLE move called ""bash,"" you can burst around the screen at great speeds slingshotting off projectiles and enemies -- or sometimes both. Think dishonored's blink that Daud had or Mark of the Ninja's Grappling hook...but on MASSIVE CRACK. Essentially a speedrunners wet dream. I had oodles of fun with it & it never got old. When you play, there's gonna be this one part you'll never forget in terms of gaming experiences, trust me. You'll love it.The only real big qualm I had with it gameplay-wise was that it had no boss fights...and oddly enough I hate bosses in games. Contrary to my normal MO...I wanted more, but sadly just got grunt enemies. Didn't cut down satisfaction too much, but I would've really enjoyed that. I'd liken it to a Fitting dinner...but would've been made better by a sublime dessert afterWhile I absolutely LOVEEEEEEDDD this game and will play it again at least 2 more times back to back...I still don't feel like it's worth $20 entry. A couple features are lacking to substantiate such a thing. You're not allowed to re-enter your completed game and 100% it...which was done purposefully, but they could easily make the completed save a ""memory"" that Ori dives back into to fit the lore. Also aside from the game being fun, there's no incentive to replay. Also, a number of areas are super fun to do over & over...but there's no way to do them outside of an actual save/campaign. I could go on & on about things missed, but that'll be another video.If you've a choice of a gift or can get this discounted around $15 or $10, definitely get it. If you've got money burning in your pocket & nothing to do, then for sure nab this. We NEED A SEQUEL MOON STUDIOS. PLEASE.There are a number of things with this game that urk me, but none of them truly detract from the whole experience. When you play, be sure to get some good headphones. You'll need them ;)"

If you have beaten SMB then you will not find this game as challenging as most people would (and you'll beat it in less than 8 hours). Still, the story is great, soundtrack is amazing, controls are tight, and the game doesn't hold your hand by telling you that you can't or have to do something. The only real issue that I have with the game is that you can beat it fairly quickly, 1 overworld, 3 dungeons, 3 ""boss runs"". TL;DR - Great game, could have been longer, I absolutely do not regret paying $20 for the experience that Ori and the Blind Forest gave me. Highly Recommened"

I cannot recommend it enough.Positives:Beautiful VisualsAmazing Soundtrack and Sound DesignExcellent PlatformingMetroidvania ExplorationSurprisingly Good StoryNegatives:Eventually The Game EndsYou should be aware that, depending on your skills at challenging platforming games, you may hit a rather large difficulty spike about 1/3 through the game.  Don't panic!  The skills you acquire getting past that part are essential for the rest of the game.  Although I was momentarily frustrated, I never felt like the game was cheating me.You should probably also know that, even though the beginning of the game might seem easy, this is game where you will die a lot; however, like Super Meat Boy, you get right back to the action very quickly, so it doesn't feel like a drag.My first play through, without any guide or knowledge of the game, took me about 5 hours and 30 minutes, and I died over 200 times.  I have since completed the game 3 more times, playing different ways to get different achievements.  I'm currently working on my 5th playthrough.   I very rarely play through the same game multiple times, but Ori is so good, I just didn't want to put the game down.Seriously, Ori and the Blind Forest really is that good.  You should play it!Update: Played through 7 times and got all of the achievements.  I'm looking forward to the definitive edition."

It's not very often I find a title with gameplay so simple, yet so fluid and enjoyable, that it pulls me in right from the start and holds my interest right till the end. This is paired with a set ofincrediblyvivid and detailed 3-D rendered environments to explore, and a storyline as moving as some of the finer Disney movies I've watched in my life.I mean, seriously! Naru, the bear-like character who serves as Ori's surrogate mother, made adreamcatcherto hang over his little bed! I couldn't help but D'awwww at how heartfelt and touching that was, and it got even better with a montage of Ori and Naru working together to harvest fruit trees. Ah, I haven't felt such happy tears at something so unbearably cute in a long, long time. ^^Ah, but the gameplay. A good story is only about half of a good game, yes? The mechanics are what keep you coming back for more. And boy, doesOri and the Blind Forestdeliver. I'm just gonna go ahead and break this down for you, with a little bullet-point list for expedience:Save Game/Checkpoints system.This game handles it a little differently from some platformers you may be familiar with. While there are a few fixed game-save points which you can activate, much like the Save Stations from Metroid (they even restore your health and energy to boot), you can save your own game at will at almost any time through the use of theSoul Linkability. You can spend one block of Energy to create a Soul Link on virtually any patch of safe, stable ground without monsters nearby, which instantly saves your game in a quite gratifying flash of azure blue light. A flame-like effect will remain at that spot until you create another Link, so you can come back and re-use them (once you've unlocked a certain ability, anyway) whenever you want. Soul Links are also how you access the game's ability system, which I'll explain briefly below.Ability system.Ori gainsSpirit Light(think ""experience points"") by defeating enemies, and collecting bulk pickups scattered all over the world, often placed in tricky locations you'll need special skills or quick reflexes to get. Once you've collected a certain number of these shiny yellow points, Ori gains anotherAbility Pointwhich he can spend to augment his abilities. This is done through the simple tap of a key when at a Soul Link, which brings up a simple spiral tree of neat perks you can choose from, ranging from attack damage enhancements to seeing through walls to breathing underwater.Agile movement design.It's no secret:  Ori is an exceptionally agile character, and the developers wanted you to experience just what that feels like. As you progress through the game and Ori learns new abilities, he will be able to cling to or jump off of walls, somersault through the air in a double jump, and even use enemies -- and theirown projectiles-- as a springboard to launch himself long distances. That last ability is one you will use often, and it's one of the funnest I've ever had in any platformer game to date. When you learn it, you will be able to not only rabbit-kick off an enemy's head to give yourself a boost, but simultaneously launch them in the opposite direction -- great for knocking enemies into spikes, or saving yourself from falling onto some yourself!Also, Ori seems to enjoy all the incredible acrobatics just as much as I do -- from the start, his normal jumps will sometimes be a rather graceful forward flip instead of a normal leap. It does nothing for actual gameplay, but it just looks awesome!Leaderboards system.For those of you who like a challenging game where you can compete with others to get the best score possible, this one should be an instant win for your shelf.Ori and the Blind Forestranks you on time taken to finish the game (it averages about 7 hours), your completion rate (Life Cells found, etc.), and how many times you died (and you will die alot,trust me xD). My current best sits at approximately 4 hours completion time, but some of the best speedrunners manage it in around 3. So if that sort of thing is for you, I'd recommend picking upOri and the Blind Forestfor the bragging rights. ^^All in all, yes, I very much recommend this game for players of all ages, and for all playstyle preferences. There's a lot here to see. And there's going to be a lot more, soon, because a Definitive Edition for this game has been announced for release early 2016 (this year), which is going to bring even more features and new mechanics to the table! So yeah, get this game now while it's still hot! Clear-cut5 out of 5!"

Even with playing it on the lowest resolution possible on my average laptop and an xbox controller plugged in, it still became one of my favorite games of all time.I have only played this game once, but it definitely has a lot of replayability. The graphics are absolutely stunning as well, if you couldn't already tell from looking at the game lmao. Whenever I was in front of a cool background I would amp up the resolution and take a screenshot because it was just so pretty. The story doesn't tell you a whole lot and sometimes can be a little vague, but the way the story is presented makes up for it. There are no words, just actions and pictures, which shows how much less means more.Gameplay mechanics are great, I had so much fun leveling up certain branches of Ori's abilities and slashing the crap outta things. Fighting is also very smooth which makes for a good time. The platforming is unique, which made me feel things such as awe and frustration. There are many times in which I had to do areas over and over again until I finally made it, but the challenge adds to how amazing this game is for such a low price.I'll shut up now."

Only real downside is the fact the story is not the most developed thing (it was going for a moreso interpretation deal, and platformers generally have underdeveloped stories), but the main point is that the gameplay and visuals are solid.  Probably the best platformer I have played in a while.  The game will not patch till like early-mid May 2015, so basically I would hold off buying it because people have had issues running the game, but all in all this game is a 100% reccomend from me if you like platformers, especially metroidvanias.  A word of warning, this game is a tad bit hard at times, easier than stuff like super meat boy but harder than stuff like mario basically, its still fair as long as you respect each area and proceed with relative caution.  The worst part about this game is that it feels so short, but the experience probably would get worse if they stalled the ending for the sake of making the game longer.  The only bad things I can say about the game are needlessly nitpicky since it is just general flaws of the genre, no game can be perfect, but Ori is pretty close for me.TL;DR~9/10Pros+Looks good (literally random screenshots are good wallpaper material)+Fun and rewarding to play+Fair difficulty+Amazing world to explore+Soundtrack is pretty good+Gameplay is the focus of the game+Good replay valueCons-Game is short-Not the most accessible game, appeals to a more specialized audience, platformer fans would like this, hardcore action is not the focus of this game-Story is not as strong as you would expect, but still good enough for what it is-CAN be unstable, uncommon but still in the realm of possibility for the game to not work, will be patched soon though"

It's never boring, although some tasks are so difficult that you have to repeat them multiple times to move forward, which can be tedious. However, that makes the game challenging, which is an asset.The only issue I had with this game (actually, it's an issue with my comptuer) is that after an hour or two of gameplay, my computer overheats. I don't have a stellar PC, and I don't know a lot about what causes a computer to overheat, but I've played Skyrim, Oblivion, Kingdoms of Amalur, Witcher, and other super involved games without having that problem. Minecraft is the only other game that's ever made my laptop overheat after extended play. So I wouldn't buy it unless you have a pretty beefy gaming computer. If you DO, play this game!

,Recommended,261570,17063995,"Posted: 15 July, 2015",all,Retrospect,"This game...... it's one of a kind. For some reason, I always expect these kind of platformers to be the same, jump around in a side-scrolling world, and kill enemies... basically a Mario game. But when I read on their offical website that they took the bases of Zelda and other retro games, and used them to inspire the creation of Ori, I knew had to play this game. Not because of my crazy love of Zelda, but because of the way they wrote about how it inspired them. That is something I completely understand. When I loaded up the game, I found not just another platformer, but a game with the most gorgeous artwork for texturing, and a beautifully orchestrated soundtrack. When a player sees and hears that, just from the start menu, you know an enormous amount of effort went into the creation of this game. And once you play this game... well, its an experience like no other. At first the game mechanics confused me, like the abilty to save only when you had enough resources, but after a very well thought out gameplay introduction, it began to make a lot more sense. What is even more lovely about this game, is that you don't have to learn everything all at once; the farther you progress into the game, the more you master your abilities, and then a new ability is presented to you. This is great because you can be sure by the time you reach the end of the game, you will know how to use Ori's powers inside and out.Now, for those who are skeptical about buying this game, I understand. $20 is a lot of money to spend on Steam, especially on just one game. To you I say, please, watch this playthrough that I recorded of me playing though Ori. It doesn't reveal too much, only the intro and a few other cut scenes, but trust me you will want to watch those again yourself anyways. And after watching, if you still don't want to pay that much, at least put this game into your wishlist, for it will inevitably will go on sale sometime.And lastly, I say many thanks to the creators of this game, who put more effort than I could imagine into its' creation.https://youtu.be/gf-nLU34xog"

Five minutes in, I had a huge grin on my face and realized I underestimated this game.  About ten minutes later, I knew this game would be something special.Before I continue, there is one matter I must touch upon.  A few days ago, it was announced Ori is getting a Definitive Edition this fall (same year standard version released).  For most games, I'd cry cashgrab. But with Ori, I'm glad.  More Ori for me, and a well-deserved second wind for GotY awards while exposing Ori to a larger audience.PRESENTATIONAnyways back to the review.  The presentation is simply phenomenal in all regards. Foregrounds, backgrounds, and animation ALL look amazing.  At times mistakable for something from Miyazaki/Ghibli or classic Disney.  Very rarely, effects and lighting will make it to hard to see yourself, but it's worth it to keep the gorgeous art.The music and sound are wonderful, and features several recurring themes.  Whether it be the incredibly upbeat piece during Naru and Ori's adorable fruit gathering adventure in the prologue, or the calming yet thrilling music of the difficult end segment of the Ginso Tree that keeps you going ""one more time"" for 20 more times.The story has a great blend of show AND tell which keeps it exceptionally effective, despite being simpler and getting far less screentime than something like Dust (let alone a major RPG). Usually events are handled extremely quickly, typically within either 5-20 seconds of in-engine events or 1-3 text boxes, then you're playing again.  There are about six exceptions that go on over a minute: the amazing playable prologue, the ending, and about 4 scenes that occur midgame.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay can be described as a 2D Metroidvania, but squarely focused on platforming with some light puzzle solving over combat.  Controls are fast and highly responsive, you press jump and you jump right away. Combat exists, but giving your main attack omnidirectional auto-homing was an intentional choice made to keeps the main focus on little Ori's movement.Most of the game can be played anywhere from fast and risky to slow and methodical.  However, there are some challenging setpieces, and the first is of those is a forced ""rush it or die"" situation.  Nothing ever achieves Super Meat Boy insanity, but Ori occasionally dips into the lower end of Rayman's treasure chases.  Luckily, death is minor as you respawn very quickly and an early skill let's you set down your own checkpoints.NITPICKS-Nothing unforgivable, but worth mentioning.1]Certain areas become permenantly locked off.  Meaning an extra playthru to 100%2]There is no ingame option to change what buttons do.3]The amazing setpiece moments can be brutal on a first playthru.4]The voices are not in English and sometimes one voiced word comes out to a full text box.5]I'd love seeing Ori in Smash Bros, but as Microsoft published Ori, chances are poor.CONCLUSIONRather than simply recreate a bygone era, Ori and the Blind Forest gives us a 7-10 hour glimpse into a world that could have been; a world where 2D never became a bygone in the first place.  When I first cleared the game and the end credts began, I got out of my chair and gave a standing ovation.RATING9/10, VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and the current frontrunner for my GotY."

Ok I apologise for that outburst, but this game is the best game, out of the hundreds I have had the fortune (and misfortune) to play. That is really saying something for me. It is my honest opinion that you will enjoy this game, if not as much as I did, then more than at least 90% of the games in your library.Please recognize that there are few games of this level of quality and that this is something worth far more than the 20$ it is being sold for.I am done begging now... now I have to DEMAND of the people reading this and who aren't convinced that this is worth 20$ to reconsider and actually watch the video by Jesse Cox because they (perhaps YOU) could not have watched that video without their money flying out of their wallets and into the hands of the people who worked tirelessly to make this game.You won't regret it."
,Recommended,261570,16628108,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,Bitcoon,"I cannot possibly recommend this game enough.I personally love Metroidvania games, and Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the best I've ever played. Its abilities mostly focus on exploration and platforming over combat, though a skill tree system does give you the opportunity to build toward your preferred play-style. As you progress in the game, backtracking becomes very fluid, fun and rewarding on its own. They really nailed the mechanics, which makes exploring this world very rewarding. They managed to turn enemies and their projectiles from obstacles to opportunities, and in doing so created a great risk-reward system.You can probably see it for yourself, but this game is gorgeous, and the music is simply perfect. If running around wasn't rewarding enough on its own, the audio and visuals take it even higher. And then there's the story/setting, which really does need to be experienced. The first 10 minutes alone are a beautiful emotional rollercoaster, but even as the game gets going it never stops hinting at details of this very interesting setting and driving you toward your goal. As the overarching story slowly pieces itself together it weaves a sad but beautiful tapestry in very few words. It would have been so easy to mess up on the story side of things, but they really nailed it.The only gripes I have with this game are fairly small ones. There are no difficulty options, which means low-level players will find a few challenges pretty frustrating, and high-level players have no challenge mode or options to make it tougher other than picking up fewer items or not upgrading their skills. My only other issue is with an area of the game which doesn't allow you to return once you've completed it. There is no way to revert back a save, so if you move into the final room in one of the game's three ""dungeons"" then you'll trigger an event which autosaves before you leave for good. Tying 100% completion to collectibles you can permanently skip is a bit of a taboo in this genre. I normally try to 100% my first run on these games, but unless you're having an especially tough time, you might want to leave that for subsequent playthroughs.But hey, Ori is such a perfect game, there's no way I can leave it at only one playthrough. I would try to unlock all the achievements as well, if there wasn't one for beating the game without dying.Final score:If you like video games, play this video game. 10/10, and that's not a score I'd throw around lightly."

,Recommended,261570,14885513,"Posted: 14 March, 2015",all,Cardare Anbraxas,"After completing Ori and the Blind Forest I can say with absolute certainty that it's 'one of those' games, and by that I mean it's easily one of the best games I've played so far this year. For a Unity engine game, the controls are perfect and require a good degree of mastery to 'get' how the bash mechanics work, which you'll have to pick up fast if you want any hope of getting through certain parts of the game without dying.The art style makes any screenshot you see of this game look like art in its own right, but in real time, everything moves. The cutscenes are in-engine and mesh perfectly with playable events: sometimes you don't even notice it's your turn to take part in the story by how well it does this.The sound design is possibly the strongest example I've seen where the sound completely integrates with the game, and allows you as the player to relax where no sense of urgency is required, and forces you to the edge of your seat when events unfold and require you to perform at your best in order to get out of a sticky situation. Kuro, the not-so-friendly owl not only comes across as formidable, but fearsome and impossible to even contemplate ever attempting to take on, and her cries and screeches have you desperately scrambling using every skill you've learned to get out of her way. Amongst all the other things going on, she comes out clear as day to let you know she's coming, she's coming fast, and she's coming to kill you.As for gameplay, this is a hard game. You'll die, a lot. As I said above, you'll need to master all the abilities you learn if you have any hope of getting far in this game, and sometimes the puzzles will have you completely perplexed as to how to get around them. Ori controls brilliantly, and the game responds to you extremely fast, a given considering some parts of the game require you to be precise with your movements as you scale the forest from its marshes to it's very peak.I'll admit that the difficulty in some areas might put some off, but the sense of relief you get from clearing them is worth the effort (and the many deaths). Is it worth the price tag? Absolutely. I couldn't fault this game in any places, and the only thing I'll say is that the gorgeous artwork doesn't always help you find your way, but I think that is partly the point. You are exploring a place you've never been to before, no one has ever traversed. There are no arrows to help you navigate, and sometimes you have to think out of the box to get around. There are many senses of accomplishment to be had here, and they are all yours for the taking.I have no problem recommending Ori and the Blind Forest, especially if you're in to metroidvania-style titles, or even just to get sucked in to a world that has been painstakingly perfected from art to sound to control. I'll be keeping a close eye on Moon Studios from this point on.Edited: Just a quick mention on the story front as I didn't earlier but didn't think I needed to. While there is a story it is minimal, and very remeniscent of Disney of old which is a good thing: It's not the length of the story that is key, but how it unfolds. The story is not told to you, but shown through the very heavy use of animation that would make anyone a fan of animated movies glow with glee. Ever felt like you wanted to leap in to the screen and help a loved character in trouble when watching any Disney movie when you were a kid? With Ori and the Blind Forest, you have that power and it feels awesome."

How I wish I knew of it when it came out.Ori and the Blind Forest has changed my life. I'm not even kidding. This game has swiftly become one of my favorite obsessions. The artwork is simply stunning, the music is captivating, and the story is one for the ages.Set in the forest of Nibel, the Spirit Tree unwinds a deep plot of destruction and demise as the forest around him begins to die without his essences. Ori, an orphan from the tree, is found and cared for by a loving mother figure called Naru. Slowly, the forest around them begins to wither and die, and only Ori can restore life.This game is wonderfully designed. Gameplay-wise, it follows the traditional formula of many Metroidvania-style games of platforming, defeating enemies, and unlocking upgrades to your power and health, as well as finding new abilities along your path.The story does not take very long to complete (It took me roughly 10 hours to finish), but it is one that will leave you wanting more. I heavily anticipate the release of the Definitive Edition, which adds in more areas and more abilities, as well as backstory on Naru.Ori and the Blind Forest should be at the top of every list of PC games that must be played. Coupled with the visual and audio brilliance, this game does not fail to deliver a memorable experience for the player."

Owls arejerksnotjerks●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●×°×★Summary Review★×°×Overall Rating: ★★★★★ [5/5]Story: ★★★★★Gameplay: ★★★★★Sound: ★★★★★●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●★OVERALL★Let me start by saying I'mnota fan of platformers. Out of the 264 games I own only 7 of them are platformers. Generally speaking, I find them boring, too difficult, or lacking in story development. I wasn't a Mario Bros kid, I was a Sonic the Hedgehog kid.Ori and the Blind Forest takes all the great mechanics from Metroid, Castlevania, Sonic, and other 2D platformers from the classic console era and puts them into their game with expert precision. Then wraps the gameplay in one of the most emotionally driven and deeply touching stories since Bamby or the Lion King. And if that wasn't enough to get your Feels O' Meter hitting 9000, they finish you off with an amazing soundtrack choreographed by a real chamber orchestra that could easily compete with the big boys at Blizzard and Disney.Despite all this praise I must err on the side of caution to tell you that this isNOTan easy game! There are times when exact precision and retention of muscle memory is required to complete dexterous maneuvers, especially during ""escape"" runs. Trial and error by death is the only way to get past a lot of the obstacles and objectives. However, if you can push past these difficulties you'll be rewarded with a story that will touch your heart, thrill you when completing challenges, and become an instant favorite among your game library.★STORY★You play as Ori, a cat-like spirit that resides within the a great tree at the center of the forest. When Ori becomes separated from the Spirit Tree during the great storm, Naru, a ""forest mother,"" discovers the young spirit and raises it as her own child. The two quickly bond and, for a time, find peace. But the forest of Nibel is dying, food is running out, and Naru must protect her new family as long as hope holds out. But hope alone cannot sustain them, and Naru sacrifices herself so that Ori may live. An orphan once again, Ori sets out into a dark, decaying forest full of enemies to solve the mystery that plagues his home, find a way to revive the Spirit Tree, and (hopefully) revive the creature Naru whom he's come to know as mother.Moon Studio wasn't exaggerating when they said that Ori and the Blind Forest explores a deeply emotional story about love and sacrifice, and the hope that exists in us all. This story will make you believe in love again.★GAMEPLAY★This is one of those games that starts off incredibly difficult to the point of hair pulling frustration. Your health is low, the Energy you use for save points is minimal and rare to find, and you have no special abilities with which to overcome most of the obstacles you see. But with time comes power. More and more health to the point of almost invincibility. Ludicrous amounts of Energy allows you to save as often as you want. And once all your Abilities are unlocked, you'll be able to navigate the entire map and reach any objective you desire.But that doesn't mean things will be easy. There's still plenty of challenge to go around. And even at max HP, you'll still die occasionally. This is emphasized during ""escape"" runs, sometimes appropriately called ""gauntlets."" Trial and error, success and failure are the only means to surpass these events. You'll have to remember the pattern of traps, pitfalls, and execute maneuvers with expert precision. Gameplay can run between 7 and 15 hours depending on how much you complete and/or if you speed run through the game. So put the dog outside, turn off your phone, and tell work you're pulling a sickie, because the forest of Nibel needs you, and Ori is their only hope!★SOUND & MUSIC★With a beautiful soundtrack choreographed by a chamber orchestra that resonates through your heart, the music of Ori and the Blind Forest perfectly sets the mood of the story as it unfolds through animated cutscenes that were hand painted. Sound effects are spot on, adding to the whimsical ambience of a spiritual forest full of creatures both light and dark in nature. Everything feels appropriate and natural.★BUGS & BOTHERS★I'm pretty critical of games. Coming from a 90's kid, I remember when video games had to ship out perfect and bug free, because there was no way to update the game once it reached the hands of gamers. Sure, you could re-release it later with a special edition to fix bugs and add new content, but since most people either had no internet or 56k modems, pushing big updates through the internet wasn't an option. Unfortunately, with the easy access and huge bandwidths of our modern era also comes lazy developers, bulky code, and bugs galore. A general attitude of, ""Just fix it later"" has become the norm. Pressure to ship new games each yearly quarter has filled the pockets of big corporate developers, but it's emptied the expectations of us, the gamers.Ori and the Blind Forest is one of those extremely rare games where I experienced absolutelynobugs. NO BUGS! The game mechanics worked perfectly every time and deaths were the sole responsibility of my own mistakes. Since I can't speak of any bugs, I guess the only bother I'd give this game is that it might be too difficult for some people. It is frustrating sometimes and that might deter a few gamers from completing the whole thing."

It's a story about love and loss and isn't exactly told through words but rather through actions. I wish I could say more, but part of the experience is watching and playing for yourself.GameplayThe gameplay is flawless and very frustrating at times. Throughout your journey you'll encounter small puzzles, tough enemies and new abilities that help and allow you to progress. Take into account that this is a game that escalates the difficulty the more you gain abilities and not the other way around. And that is partly why this game is frustrating and unique at the same time. But in a great way.Graphics and atmosphereAbsolutely gorgeous graphics. Everything feels alive. Trees move, wind blows, leaves and dirt kick up and sometimes you'll even see creatures in shadow move in the background. The world of Ori feels very familiar to that of Pandora from Avatar through some segments (which is in no way a bad thing) and completely new in others. You'll be drawn in and awed the moment you first start and all throughout.MusicThe music in this game is so well done that I had to make a segment just for that. The music was done with the utmost feelings put into it. From the soft female hums, to the piano and the orchestrated backup this music touches your very soul and sticks with you. If I were to compare this music with anything it would be the music you'd hear in great anime games like Mabinogi and Final Fantasy. And even that is a bad comparison to the music you'll hear. It fits perfectly with the story and lore and you'll feel happiness and sadness at the same time.OverallOri and the Blind Forest is absolutely nothing short of a masterpiece. From the very moment I booted this game up I thought ""This is exactly why videogames are an art form"". It's an experience I will never forget and will love to replay over and over. I hope Moon Studios decides to one day make a sequel and I could very well see co-op integrated as well (is that too much to hope for?). I hesitated on buying this and I regret I ever did.

How wrong I was ! This is the best Metroidvania game I ever played. Brilliant story (the kind that could make you get a tear in the first minutes), fantastic gameplay (Super Meat Boy meets Dust : An Elysian Tail) and an amazing music score by Gareth Coker.If you liked Valdys Story, Dust : An Elysian Tail, Super Meat Boy, Trine, Super Metroid, and you like colorful animation movies such as Disney's The Lion King, Aladdin or Miyazaki's Tonari no Totoro, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, etc... you will definitely love this game.Best hand drawn animation I've ever seen in a 2D game, full of striking colors and variety, brilliant lightning and great tight unforgiving platforming controls makes this game the perfect love letter to any anime and Metroid fan. The art assets are actually so numerous and so well done that you cannot find them twice, according to one of the developer from the small team that compose Moon Studios.If you're not sure about it yet, just watch a high definition trailer, it is even better looking at 60 fps when you realise that every single background part is actually animated. Four years of development in a small team that almost never met themselves in person before E3 2014 is pretty impressive for such a marvellous and astonishing piece of art.10/10Just a bit more than halfway into the game, I don't see what could make it lose points.Only one negative part so far, you cannot get the soundtrack on Steam.

Les assets d'art sont même si nombreux et si riches que vous ne pouvez pas les trouver à deux reprises, selon l'un des développeurs de la petite équipe qui compose Moon Studios.Si vous n'êtes pas encore convaincus et en train d'y jouer, regardez simplement un trailer haute définition, il est encore plus beau à 60 fps surtout quand vous réaliserez que chaque partie du background est animée. Quatre années de développement dans une petite équipe (dont les membres ne se sont d'ailleurs pratiquement jamais rencontrés en personne avant l'E3 2014) c'est assez surprenant pour un tel chef-d'oeuvre d'animation jouable.10/10Etant un peu plus de la moitié dans le jeu, je ne vois pas ce qui pourrait lui faire perdre des points. Peut-être la difficulté éventuellement, mais ça rappelera aux fans de jeux récents complètement idiotisés (les jeux hein, pas les fans, quoique desfois...) qu'avant on faisait des vrais jeux où fallait apprendre à jouer, et que Ori en est certainement un.Seulement un point négatif jusqu'ici, on ne peut acheter la bande son sur Steam.

You gain XP, allowing you to put points in a talent tree, upgrading your main weapon, life regen, see on the map where blocked paths and treasures are for easy backtracking, etc.Controls are spot-on, very pleasing. The game is decently difficult. Enemies and hazards do a lot of damage, killing you in 3 hits usually (but there's plenty of life laying around), spikes everywhere. Combat is fairly easy. Overall you shouldn't have too much trouble progressing. The game avereages 10 hours of gameplay if you try to get all the secrets.The story is classic and nice. You'll shed a tear at the prologue. You're a little spirit of light who must restore the elements and the great spirit tree, who were disturbed by a great bird.

The only point at which I did find something to complain about was very late in the game when I realized that since I had missed a powerup that was in a certain part of the game that you can't return to, I was locked out of 100% completion (though it was mostly my fault, since the powerup is in plain sight and I just assumed I had to come back to it later).

The first chapters of the game are well done and have great contrast between grim surroundings and astonishing points of interests. Yet later on, literally everything on the screen yells 'look how beautiful it is!' It becomes visually overloaded to the point where I started to ignore the ammount of work that was put into the game's art. And that is a bad design choice! You can't have everyting glowy and shiny, you need something to rest your eyes on! You need contrast between plain and beautiful.-Now, what was that about art getting in the way of gameplay? More often than not there is too much clutter on the screen that makes it hard to see enemies and projectiles. And that leads to taking damage because I was unable to see the danger in time. The foreground is blocking the screen and enemies. Hitboxes for animated spiked bushes and other hazards are sometimes hard to read. And there are places where everything is the same colour - environment, enemies, projectiles, hazards. Needless to say you'll get hit there. Alot.-Music in this game is nice, but forgettable. It lacks originality to be remembered - and that is the key difference between music that just fits the theme and GOOD music.-Controls are good for the most part. And here's ""but"" again. At some point when new LOCAL mechanics are introduced the controls... well, could be better. It makes navigating hazardous paths extremely confusing (you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there).-Speaking of mechanics... Atleast one of the given skills is absolutely useless and only used for one forced local mechanic. I'm talking about wall climb. Ori doesn't need it! He can climb walls without any difficulties with wall jump that he gets literally in the begining of the game. Besides, going up walls with wall jump is faster than using wall climb.-Writing is good... bu-u-ut! Sometimes it doesn't makes sense.For example, there's a point where Sein talks to Ori about dead gumos and he says something like ""I hope Gumo can forgive us because we live and they don't."" Ok... so, Ori is the last of his kind. Gumo is also the last of his kind... So why would he be angry with Ori, then? It just... doesn't make sense! Oh, and then Gumo ""decides to act"" and grabs the glowy thing that was holding the place together and everything starts falling apart. Why did he do that? I guess the only reason is that Developers needed a reason to make another run-for-your-life section of the game.Maybe it all has an explanation later on, but at that point I got tired of the game and didn't finish it."

,Recommended,261570,17016441,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,Bob,"This game left me both disappointed and satisfied. Its art and music are astounding. They are both breathtaking and varied enough to keep you mesmerized for the whole game. Everything good that has been said about the art direction and the music is true.The gameplay is lack luster. Unless the level design forces you to use the various abilities they are easily forgotten. The Bash ability is essentially all you need. You'll be using it in most puzzle, escape sequences and it will be the only way to kill certain enemies or to simply skip them. The best option to move around at high speed is also the Bash ability.The game design is on par with the gameplay. Sometimes during the play sessions its becomes plainly clear that the game is linear. There's no point in actually exploring the world. While you could wander around the world for power ups, there are enough littered around the golden path that its actually superfluous. The golden path is always indicated and thus the next area to be explored is obvious. This leads the player to pursue the objectives quickly in order to acquire the abilities required to get the hidden power ups. The most serious flaw is discovered at this point. One could argue that its either the fact that the game's autosave overwrites the user's save data or that the final state of the game does not let the player acquire all of the power ups. Of the two possible fixes, making the autosave use a hidden slot that is loaded when the player uses the ""continue"" button would not only have been simple but expected of games of this millenium.I recommend it simply because its a beautiful experience. It will be remembered for its art and music... and not much else."

When sad things happen you dont feel sad for the character you legitimately feel sad.  Same with the happy moments and the scary moments, there were times when I was really scared, it wasn't because some cheap jumpscare but because the situation seemed grim, you're really invested in getting Ori to his destination.  Some people will argue that maybe the pricetag is too much, I wouldn't agree.

It's a 2D platformer with smooth animations and super tight controls, which you will appreciate even more during the games action sequences that really require precision and timing. It has a touching story and a great soundtrack. It is without a doubt the most visually stunning 2D platformer of 2015.I highly recommend you play this game."

From the characters to the world to its story, everything about it is pretty, not even counting the fact that Ori is probably the most adorable main character I've played as in a very long time.But recommending the game out of how pretty it is alone would be somewhat shallow of me so I'm going to talk about its gameplay aspect for a bit.It's a nice metroidvania-style game with a series of skills to explore its world and the ability to upgrade them as you keep playing, and the best thing about this is that said series of skills allow you to tackle some areas and puzzles in more than one way in a fashion that makes it depend on how creatively (and boldly) you put them to use. One thing to point out, however, is that this doesn't make the game easy; There's plenty of challenge and more than one part had me stuck for a bit trying to get through, but this challenge is rarely, if ever, taken to a level where you'd say things were unfair. More often than not, dying is going to be your mistake and not something the game pulled on you.All-in-all, this is a nice-looking and nicely-challenging game that I really recommend to fans of platforming and metroidvania-style games, and I'd say the world and lenght of the game are worth the price."

,Recommended,261570,16312521,"Posted: 11 June, 2015",all,Reclaimer,"Absolutely stunning and beautiful game. From start to finish this game had me in awe of its beauty. Even if you dont like platformers it's worth playing just to appreciate the art.If you've played any platformer and enjoyed it then I highly reccomend this game. It is a tough game, but not as tough as    something like Super Meat Boy. From the start the game the game is a challenge and the game has various mechanics that it introduces, like the basic double jump. And every time you get a new ability the game will then adapt to that new ability and increase in difficulty based on that ability. Double jump for example, for a while in the game you don't have double jump, but once you do get it, the things around you are suddenly harder to get to and only accessable with double jump. Double jump is the most basic of the abilities you get. Also through out the game you will see various collectables that seem impossible to get to, which in my mind, is there way of showing you that at some point in the game you'll get an ability that'll allow you access to that said collectable. And it's great because it allows your imagination to ponder what could possibly get you up that that collectable.This game is unique in many ways, one of them being that it is an open world platformer. The only game that has a similar feat is Super Mario 64 but that game was also 3D and over the shoulder. This is the only 2D platformer that is truely open world. You can go to any area you want, at anytime, once you've gone through them all. But again refering to abilities, you can only go to places that are possible for you to go through. The open world aspect adds a lot to the game in the sense that you actually have reason to go back to places. Through out the game there are collectables, and there are 3 main types (there are others but for the sake of reading I'm gonna narrow it down), Health Cells, Energy Cells and XP Cells. Those collectables grant you big advantages and are all self explanitory. From the beginning of the game these collectable are seen in seemingly unreachable places but once you gain the necessary abilities you then can go and get them, which is where the open world aspect comes in. Say you're on the other side of the map and you remember seing a collectable that you are certain you can now get, well now you can run over there and get it, and you might even come across some other collectables you had forgotten about. Thats why the game being open world is so great because you have the freedom to go where you please, and also, no loading screens!An other thing the game does well is the skill tree. Not many platformers you see have a skill tree. The skill tree is great because it is separate from your main abilities other than adding on to them to make them stronger (Basically you unlock your main abilities through out the game at points when it is a must to have said ability). There are 3 different trees that all have different focus. You have a utility tree, a combat tree, and an efficiency tree. tl;dr on the different trees, Utility focuses on character movement like jumping, effiecncy tree focuses on getting more bang for your buck, ie. how much xp you get for kills, lastly, the combat tree focuses on your combat diversity ie. how much damage you do and how quickly you do it. The 3 trees allow for different types of gameplay and give you great benefits in the end. For example, the last skill in the agility tree makes your double jump into triple jump, giving you a huge advantage in getting around the map. But the game isn't unbalanced where if you decided to max the combat tree there are no situations that you absolutley need triple jump. Maxing a tree is more of a privledge than it is a necessity, which is the greatest thing about the skill tree.The enemys in this game are very interesting and fun to fight, though some are annoying to deal with that only means they succeded in making a true enemy (something that you truely do not like). And again every enemy you face will play into your abilities in some fassion, I'm not going to go into to too much detail seeing as I have already written a great deal. But every enemy you face is combatable in many different ways once you start unlocking new abilities. You may come across enemys that you have fought many times but once you unlock new abilities the fassion in which you fight them changes indeffinitely.TL;DR This game is extremely inovative, unique and beautiful which gives the game its greatness and is why the game is held so highly. This game deserves a 10/10 for being a truely remarkable game."

The game is a Metroidvania style platformer with the art style similar, if not better than the Rayman series. It has an incredibly adorable cast of characters that you really feel emotions for despite them not saying a single word. It has a brilliant soundtrack that will make you feel at peace within a tranquil forest or get your adrenaline going with one of the many escape sequences that have hazards tossed at your every turn. My only problem was that some of the areas in the game are only able to be accessed once before getting sealed off by some kind of obstacle, making it impossible to get 100% without starting a new game. I guess it adds to the replay value, but I would rather this not be something I have to deal with.

The graphics have touches of genre classics like Metroid and Rayman, but also of animation giants like Gibli, Disney and Dreamworks. Ori is a typical Metroidvania platformer at its core, but it's the presentation that sets it apart. Not only is it the most visually stunning 2D platformer I have ever played, it also knows how to tell a simple yet moving story through short cut-scenes. The story isn't very complex, but the way it is told makes the player emotionally invested in Ori's quest. The soundtrack is equally fantastic. The forest of Nibel feels like it once was alive, but now in decay. What still lives is mean and tries to kill you. The art direction is phenomenal !You play as Ori, a forest creature that looks like a cross between a squirrel and a monkey and is accompanied by Sein, a spirit obviously inspired by Zelda's Navi. While the gameplay is fairly standard Metroidvania fare - you explore a side-scrolling 2D world, collecting new powers to open up new areas - there's some original concepts as well. One of the most vital parts of exploring the forest of Nibel comes in the form of Bash, a move that allows Ori to launch himself along falling objects, enemies and their projectiles or lanterns hanging from the ceiling. It takes some getting used to but once you figure it out, you'll have a blast using blobs of slime hurled at you by enemies as stepping stones to safety, Another cool feature comes in the form of Ability Points. Basically these are like XP, allowing you to upgrade your powers once you collect enough of them.While exploration is as important as in other games of this type, it's also very much about tricky platforming sections. You will die very often. Ori features tight controls that are absolutely needed for the many carefully designed platforming sections. Thankfully, you can create a save point almost everywhere. This costs energy, though, forcing you to think carefully where to create them. Guiding Ori through Nibel's deadlier parts will challenge even seasoned genre fans, but the save system prevents it from becoming frustrating. The balance between challenge and convenience is great.It's not all perfect, though. There's a lack of boss battles, and the ones that are there usually aren't very complex. The three dungeons can't be re-entered, forcing you to replay the whole game if did not do a 100% run the first time. This is a major omission in an exploration-based game like Ori. Also, controller support isn't perfect at the moment. I strongly recommend an Xbox controller as the game was made for Xbox One control schemes. Other controllers may not be fully recognized, with some buttons not working. You can play with the keyboard or with a keyboard/mouse combo, but neither offer the level of comfort and precision that Ori's complex platforming sections require. For optimal control, the Xbox controller is the way to go.For purists there's still the usual speed runs or completionist playthroughs you can do, adding up to Ori's 10-15 hour quest, All in all, this is simply one of the best side-scrolling platformers in years. Still upset about not getting that proper Metroid game at 2015's E3? Stop whining and start playing the next best thing. Ori and the Blind Forest is simply fantastic. A true work of art !9/10"

(not frogs or spiders!), making the owl mother very mad, kiddnapping the power source (Sein) of the World-Tree and this leads to death of all plant life around, giving our hero a reason to finally needing to leave home and his adoptive mother.Speaking of her and Ori, the only happy memories being presented to us are about eating and building a bridge to then, eat once more. Ah, what a life!The rest of the story is all about restoring the worlds balance by reviving the three elements of light with the mystical Sein powers.To do that involves jumping atop of big tree, hiking in old ruins and climbing a volcano.-Leveldesign & Graphics-The game can be very challenging for players who aren't used to Jump'n'Runs anymore, because the passages are very narrow and every element of light comes with its own level that needs very precise timing otherwise one will suffer a death count of at least 50+ before getting it right.On the main map any location can be revisited to later gain access to all secrets with the necessary abilities.The graphics are very vivid and colorful, with fire and wind effects and a rich background making it an eye-candy among the Jump'n'Runs.-Controls-Very early on, even as a PC gamer, one will notice that this is a game which is destined to be played with a controller otherwise your fingers will start bleeding after about 2 or 3hrs.The game even allows to switch between keyboard controls(plus mouse) or controller,BUT then you will notice Ori doesn't allow to allocate actions to keys which is very tragic because on the controller the whole mapping has gone wrong and that doesn't allow the late-game abilities [charged jump] and [climbing], which renders the controller utterly useless in late-game and one has to go back again breaking ones fingers at the keyboard.-Music-The music except for the escape theme isn't very memorable, which is a shame since a small orchestral score was made with professional musicians. Sadly those orchestral pieces only gain a sufficient weight and momentum with about >15-20 members which isn't the case here.I've heared more impressive scores from people even using FL Studio or orchestral libraries...-Abilities-All the abilities you are needing you are gaining by following the story.Then there are extra abilities you can unlock by killing enough enemies and gaining experience from it.But those are almost all cosmetic. One could just unlock the first 3 of every skill tree and still beat the game.-Résumé-Ori and the blind Forest is presenting us with a challenging world and beautiful scenery. If just the story was a little  deeper and wouldn't just give the feeling of running from A to B without anything memorable happening.One should buy this if one has grown up with some hardcore Gameboy or console titles, who likes a challenge.If one is hoping for a deep and emotional story that has some good story telling, one will be disappointed."

Also, prepare to die quite a bit.At times, it is the rare unexpected gems that stand out among the masses. As a person that doesn't play many platformers, I initially didn't pay Ori and the Blind Forest much mind. However, as word got around I decided to give it a spin, and what a pleasant surprise it has been!Though it has been said by literally everyone now, the art style in this game is absolutely beautiful. From the way background objects sway when Ori walks past to the animation quality, this game oozes visual polish. Combined with an outstanding soundtrack, the game immediately draws you into its well-crafted world.From the get go, the game starts off with incredible amount of emotion; I can say that I have never been so invested in a purple and black blob before, and that's literally within the first few minutes of the game! For such a simple story, it was impactful and very well presented despite having no voice acting and little narration.I am not an experienced platform player, and at times, I was frustrated by the 'escape' sections that involved a lot of death and repeats. However, after finishing the game I feel that the gameplay while challenging, isn't unfair. While at certain sections it may be difficult to tell where you should go or what to avoid, the hazards in the game are generally well telegraphed and avoidable. It is worth noting, however, that a controller is HIGHLY recommended, as the keyboard controls are known to be clunkier.Overall, I would highly recommend this game for those interested in a beautifully crafted platformer with a reasonable degree of challenge.

It's so very rare these days to find a title that redefines your understanding of what constitutes a great game. Ori and the Blind Forest takes you by the throat and shakes any preconceived notions of what a great game truly is from your mind before showing you what the real deal is, and the visual treat of that lesson is something you're not likely to forget anytime soon. Aesthetically, the journey you venture through in this game is one of the most stunningly beautiful experiences imaginable. The hand painted look of the art style in Ori and the Blind Forest is so lovingly crafted and executed that it will be difficult to admire any other games with the same sense of reverence and awe. Not only do the visuals recreate the fantasy world of Nibel with such a wonderful tone and palette, with exceptional lighting and particle effects, but the animation is truly stellar. The environment moves in such a beautifully subtle fashion that it almost feels like you’re watching a painting come to life. The character animation too is crafted with such an amazing level of detail and fluidity that it makes the various characters in the game look as if they were caught on film in the wilds. It was a shock to system to see a game capture this sense of live animated movie so well, and it will no doubt set a new industry standard for future titles in the genre. To accompany the visual treat of Ori and the Blind Forest is a score that sounds absolutely fantastic. Every piece of music hits the tone of the scene perfectly and is a joy to listen to. The musical accompaniment really accentuates the emotional core of the story and subtly guides the players thoughts and feelings to the heart of the story without ever being forceful or overbearing about it.And as for the story itself, well I wouldn’t dare spoil it for you, but it was a deeply heartfelt and emotional tale which deals with love, loss, companionship and sacrifice. It is told in such a beautiful and sombre way, successfully developing the characters, their motives, and their misfortunes, and it does so in a way that engenders real sympathy for them. You’re unlikely to fall in love with a game character more than little Ori, and that bond between the character and the player will encourage you to try harder and harder to keep him safe throughout the story. The prologue will tug at even the toughest heart strings, bringing tears to many eyes for sure, while the end is a joy to behold in a world so full of sequel bait finales, and wraps everything up with a neat little bow before leaving a huge smile on your face. Ori and the Blind Forest has a great story to tell, and more importantly, it knows how to tell it properly.With the story, visuals, and audio planted at such a high standard, you would expect something would have to give right? Wrong. The gameplay is exceptional. It’s a love letter to all platformer fans and is pitched towards those players perfectly. That’s not to say that you won’t enjoy it if you’re not a seasoned platform gamer, but rest assured the game is designed for those with the manual dexterity and tenacity to overcome the ingenious and, on occasion, devious puzzles throughout. If “Rage Quitting” is your thing, then Ori and the Blind Forest will make your blood boil from time to time, but the sheer sense of accomplishment that you’ll get when you successfully beat the odds will be more than enough to keep you playing. It’s a tough game at times, but never did I personally feel like it was too difficult throughout the thirteen and a bit hours of wonderful entertainment that I experienced.Overall, Ori and the Blind Forest is an absolute joy to play. The controls are precise, the visuals and audio are top-notch, it’s challenging, heart warming, and worth every penny. It’s an experience that every gamer should try, just to know what a great game truly is."

,Recommended,261570,18259042,"Posted: 29 September, 2015",all,(ISIG) Legoguy9875,"Alright, I think I've waited long enough. Time to get this off my chest. To put it short: this game is my new favorite game *gasp* Yeah, I know, kinda surprising after I gushed out all of my love for Dust an Elysian Tail, but honestly, it's true in this case. Ori is better than Dust.Now, with the gist of it out of the way, let's dive into what makes this game great. I first heard about this game back during the first months of the Xbox One release, as I believe it was a launch title for the system. At the time, I thought it was a generic platformer or puzzle game with a spiritual, avatar-esque fantasy world setting, so I paid no attention to it. It was a couple weeks ago that I noticed it on Steam, and actually saw that it was a metroidvania. Metroidvanias, for the ill-informed, are subgenres in which the player starts out weak, but gradually gains new abilities, which can both aid the player in combat AND promote further exploration in large, semi-open landscapes (I say semi because you are still set to one path from point A to point B), good examples of which are, as the title says, Metroid and Castlevania. Ever since I played Dust, I have been on quite a Metroidvania marathon. I have so far played the likes of Quacamelee, Wings of Vi, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, among others, all of which I have enjoyed. Anyway, given my adoration of Metroidvanias, I decided to buy the game and give it a go.I certainly don't regret that.I honestly do not want to give the full story. Every moment of it is either really sad or really memorable. To put it in the most spoiler-free way possible, you play as Ori, a drop of light in the shape of a lemur-like creature, who is called by the Spirit tree to restore the light lost to a large owl named Kuro. To do this, you must restore power to three elemental stones throughout the land, gaining new abilities passed down by deceased light forms. This is as much of the story as I can say without giving anything major away. It's best seen for yourself how it progresses.A good story doesn't matter if a game doesn't play well. Thankfully, Ori has good gameplay in spades. The gameplay consists of platforming and fighting mechanics, along with a few puzzles sprinkled in. Defeating enemies drops EXP that, when filled up, will turn into an ability point. Ability points can be spent at restore points (that you make yourself, BTW), to upgrade certain attributes, such as the potency of health and mana drops, attack power, as well as the ability to see certain things on your map. You are able to go through the game without spending them (which is an achievement), though the upgrades you can get in the long run can prove useful when combined with powers you get in the game. Speaking of the powers, they incredibly fun to use. You have your basics, like a wall jump, a double jump, and a ground slam, but you also get some really kickass ones like a super jump, a catapult power that let's you fling yourself off of enemies and most projectiles, and the ability to run on walls, which really helps in many parts of the game. Exploration is also fun. While the map does seem large, you can get to places fairly quickly once you know your way around and when you have the right abilities. It becomes extremely satisfying when you find a hidden area that leads to a health or mana increase, or even an extra ability point that lets you power up faster. It's just as satisfying to complete difficult puzzles or get past hard battles thanks to the powers you gain.The only complaints I have are the lack of boss battles and inability to continue upon completion. When you complete the story of the game, you are sent back to the menu, and are locked out of that save file, meaning anything you forgot to collect before entering the final dungeon (which is a point of no return), becomes impossible to get unless you play the game again. This is quite a kick in the groin if it's your first playthrough, since you think you can just go back in and collect what you missed. I understand in the case of how the saving system works, but I'm sure there was another way of doing that. As for boss battles, there isn't any in the entire game. While there are a few tough enemies to fight along the way, there are no large bosses, not even one of Kuro, the main antagonist. However, the game does make up for it with the exciting escape sequences when you complete a dungeon, as they do a good job of testing your skill with the abilities you gain on your adventure.One last thing, the music. Is there really anything to say other than I have the soundtrack that I legally purchased playing in the background as I type this? The soundtrack is awesome! Easily topping my favorite OSTs. Each track is played at just the right moment, and with just the right mood to go with the scenery. If there is anything I recommend buying, it's the soundtrack, if not the game itself.Overall, Ori and the Blind Forest can now be classified as the best game I've played. Great story, awesome gameplay, amazing soundtrack, everything blends into one grand package that any metroidvania or platformer fan can enjoy. I highly recommend it.Rating: 9.5/10"

I'm not talking about that ""aww, I'm the last one left and I need to save the forest"" kind of emotion (in the beginning). I'm talking about lots of rage. In a good way, though. The game felt very casual at first. You slowly progress through the game and it teaches you how to get around enemies and obstacles and you even learn new skills as you get farther in the game. I didn't have a whole lot of trouble until I got to the top of the tree where I had to battle my way up against the rising water. That moment of the game definitely brought back memories of Super Mario and how relentless it could be when you mess up one little jump, die and then you have to start all over again.

It's a Metroidvania-style game that feels like something we lost from the Super Nintendo/Super Famicom era. It has all the gameplay mechanics you would expect from a sidescrolling game, only the catch is that you'll have to play through and eventually backtrack to acquire them and unlock them. It's a little more challenging than you're expecting from the visuals, but it never gets truly unfair. It manages that incredible sense of accomplishment when you complete a segment of it, and when you unlock new moves, it has a way of burrowing into the back of your mind when you can return to a previous area to finally get that item you tried to get for like, 10 minutes and couldn't. Absolutely recommended, and it should be in your library. I haven't tried playing the game with a keyboard, so I don't know it can be played with one.

The gameplay is fun and challenging. The story is heartbreaking.Ori and the Blind Forest is a 2D platformer, following the Metroidvania tradition. The controls are good, and as you collect power-ups, you get more and more ways to interact with the environment - by the end of the game, Ori is no longer tied to just walking and jumping, instead being able to climb, glide and dash in mid-air (with the help of enemies and projectiles). The character's animation and movement freedom is very reminiscent of an animal set loose in a forest.Although it's been tagged as difficult, the game has a very gentle learning curve: after new mechanics are presented, you have many puzzles of increasing difficulty throughout the stage in order to get used to those mechanics. By the end of each stage, though, you're put in a test for everything that you've learned so far in frantic and fast-paced situations.The game clocked just under 9 hours for me, and that was by no means a speedrun (I died 319 times, and collected 99% of the hidden goodies, with a couple of backtracking situations). I believe it's good content (which I'd love to re-visit in the future) for the original price tag, and I just can't measure how good of an experience playing this game has been.I fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good 2D game, beautiful art and music or an unique whimsical experience."

But that isn't to say that the gameplay and story are bad; far from it. The prologue of the story actually made me tear up, and the story from then on is good, but simple. Enough to keep you interested in the game. Ori is a platformer with a bit of combat and RPG elemets with a skill tree and such, which is another nice motivator to keep you playing. (I haven't finished the full story yet....but it's good.) And while all of that is great and is enough to warrant playing the game, it's the art and soundtrack that really make this game a standout in the best way.The art is in this game is some of the most beautiful I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating when I say you can take a screenshot at any point and use it as wallpaper for your PC. It's that pretty. It's absolutely gorgeous and part of the reason I want to progress in the game is simply to see the other areas and what sort of art they made for them. And the music....my god the music. It's so pretty. It's incredibly atmospheric but honestly, I could run this game in the background and listen to the game music just by itself if I could.Only downside to this game is that it seems to be poorly optimized for PC. Apparently the devs are working pretty hard on the opimization issues, but they're still there. I had an issue adjusting the resolution and ended up having to do a rather fair bit of searching to find a solution to my problem. But that's the only hiccup I've had.TL;DR+ THE GRAPHICS.

,Recommended,261570,14973088,"Posted: 20 March, 2015",all,Frog Trickery,"Ori and the Blind Forest is a great game with a few faults:What I loved,-The ArtIt's almost impossible not the be in love with the art. Every single visual aspect is so amazingly crafted and represented, it's quite surprisingly how much effort was put into it.-The platforming/controlsI didn't expect this would have such a heavy focus on platforming and precision. Many times the game requires you to pull off a lot precise jumps, with tight timing. It's very rarely frustrating. In a lot of ways it reminded me of Super Meat Boy in that regard.What I liked,-MetroidvaniaIt's not the most complex of it's kind, but I enjoyed the fact that a lot of the early upgrades are not accessible by your current abilities. I didn't feel like the game was holding my hand too much and there were plenty of reasonably hidden upgrades. I'm a sucker for this kind of game so it's easy to please. I would have liked if the game went a little more down this path-Closed off platforming 'dungeons'A few times in the game it sends you to a standalone area that is essentially a dungeon with specific platforming mechanics. These are where the level design tend to shine. During these sections the game is not limited to being interconnected as much and can simply be a platformer. These are usually where the game introduces the most difficult platfomring requirements.What I didn't like as much,-The platforming 'dungeons' are literally closed off permanentlyWhen you complete these sections of the game, you can't go back. If you miss any collectibles or upgrades, they are gone forever. That's lame. In a Metroidvania, the one thing you should never do is restrict my access to the gameworld. Especially if it's going to prevent me from getting 100%-Lengthy chase sequences that require perfection with no checkpointsMaybe I should just ""get good""? Later in the game there are some segments where you are being chased and are on a timer and have to complete sequences of platforming near perfectly. If you mess up you are instantly reverted back to the beginning. I admit they can be prett exhilerating but it's very easy to mess up and have to redo it over and over and over. And then it becomes frustrating.

It's not unreasonable to call it the prettiest 2d game on Steam, in fact, with how organic and lush the design of the playing world is.The game is mostly focused on the platforming, which is a good thing, as the combat leaves a bit to be desired. Thankfully you don't have to do alot of combat, and the game is plenty challenging with the precision jumping and puzzle sections it throws at you.My biggest complaint with the game is the several auto-scrolling segments, where the difficulty shoots up through the roof in comparison to the rest of the game and even punishes players for going too fast (the screen will just catch up with you if you do).As an avid fan of Metroidvanias, this ranks among the greats, and I enjoyed it just a tad bit more than Guacamelee (the other great modern Metroidvania on Steam, though there the combat is a much bigger focus)."

I never found myself frustrated by them, and generally had fun, particularly with the bash skill. One could argue that this skill makes the other ones rather pointless, but it didn't bother me.The game is typically all about exploring an area to find the next skill, while killing ennemies and navigating around traps set in the map. While there are some puzzles to solve, they're all simple enough that you won't get stuck because you can't figure out what to do. The beginning might be a little frustrating because there are few designated save points and you need to create the others, but you get past this ""hurdle"" pretty quickly. There are also a couple of instances of fast-paced platforming action, fitting a ""die and retry"" style. These sections are challenging enough to warrant a few fails, but clearly not so hard as to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.Controls are tight and work as intended.The soundtrack is excellent and fits with the game very well. I did had to drop the bass levels on my sound system because there are too many explosion sounds when dealing with ennemies. I recommend you either do this or turn down sound effects, the default balance isn't the best.Ori and the other characters are cute as ♥♥♥♥. Some of the cutscenes genuinely made me smile or sad. I can't even remember another game that had that effectWhile this is an excellent game, it does have its flaws.There's a particular game design flaw that I find very annoying: some collectibles were put in areas you can't return to. While I have nothing against the use of one time areas/puzzles, I don't find it's a good decision to force a player who wants 100% to restart because he missed one energy cell in the first third of the game, even if it's a short one.I also didn't like that you can't go back to your save file after you've completed it, but I honestly can't remember if the game warns you about it. You can find a powershell script on the forums that allows you to go back to your game and even one time areas if you want to go for missing collectibles, but there's one you can't get if you missed it the first time.The game is short. It took me around 6h to beat (5h34 in game time). While this encourages additional playthroughs, I did wish for a little more.Some achievements seem glitched. While this isn't relevant to the in-game experience, I somehow don't feel like trying for the speedrunning, ironman and minimalist runs if I'm not sure I'll get my ""reward"" at the end. I do like to have something to show for my effortsIn spite of this, Ori and the Blind Forest remains a very good game. The characters, music and overall universe will make it excellent for you if you're open to it."

Without spoilers hard to go too deep into it, but it's well told and doesn't interrupt the gameplay, which keeps it immersive. I'm  not sure how other games I play from now on will stack up. Seriously.Gameplay mechanics get progressively deeper as the game goes on. Zelda-esque in the way some objectives are blocked off until you get the necessary skills to get to it. Agile fingers are required! Keeps you guessing too... one section, you get gravity changes, and it's sorta out of left field and only for that one section, but introduced in such a way that it's just another challenge and not super frustrating.This music, though... pretty much inspired. Buy the soundtrack. Seriously. If you like game OSTs, this one will treat you very well.The art speaks for itself. The crazy bit is, it's throughout the game. The cutscenes and the gameplay all use the same, deep, beautiful art. Usually in a game you just focus on the foreground art, and you -maybe- get some textures for the background. This game, though, sometimes you need to pause and look at the background art, because the scenery is amazing. The level of detail is breathtaking.And it's challenging. Not so challenging that you get frustrated. If you die, there is NO LOAD SCREEN. You end up at your last save point, immediately, and get to keep going. You can save (nearly) freely, and the skills (can) help you out there. However, there are places you can't save, of course, and some platform parts are instant death if you mess up even once. Learning how enemies act when you're forced to drop in on them because of the terrain can be interesting. Anyway, the overall experience is great, because when you get past a challenge, you feel satisfied, sometimes relieved. And then you save.The combat system was very decent, but if I had to pick a weak point it would have to be here. After you get bash, all enemies are laughable, and they pretty quickly turn into just another way of getting around faster. Still, early on there is a bit of a challenge, and they do provide an obstacle. The rollers are especially annoying before you get bash. It doesn't matter though, as an addition to the platforming challenge it functions exceptionally well.Overall 10/10 Zero regrets buying this game (and on the summer sale too!) If I were you, I'd start throwing my money at the screen until good things happen."

Especially considering it's apparently the least owned game on my friends list, when both of my housemates own Dino D-day, but not this, then it's a sad day.Ori and the Blind Forest is probably the best game I have played in the past 5 years, and is without a doubt my new favourite platformer ever, and it's heavily reminiscent of Nintendo tier difficulty from the NES / SNES, I read a mixed review about Ori stating the game is like a piano, it's fun when you're hitting all the right keys, but frustrating and it snaps the mood when you're not, to some this might be a negative, to people like myself it's a positive. Games these days often pander to a more casual audience particularly when it comes to a more niche market, but with Ori they stay true to the formula, the controls are tight and any mistake is your fault, the level design is fantastic and the abilities you pick up in the game aren't original, however they are executed perfectly to meld within the areas, the map arches in all different directions and naturally you unlock certain areas once you've obtained different abilities, there's also a levelling system with three different trees, personally I obtained everything in the tree which gave me any form of mobility as I'm pedantic about map exploration and uncovering secrets, I then levelled the other two trees after, however it doesn't matter how you level yourself, hell there's even an achievement for not using of the levels.The visuals of the game are something to be commended, the art is fantastic and gorgeous to say the least, every area has the right lighting, and the transition between areas is perfect, but like a lot of art forms music and sound plays its part and the music and sound in Ori is perfect, the music blends with the visuals and creates the perfect atmosphere in every area of the game, particular areas involving Kuro execute the sound perfectly and you can literally feel yourself tense as it sets the scene and creates a sense of panic so well.The story is sweet and simple, but it's very touching and the first 5 minutes will make you cry like a ♥♥♥♥♥ like you did during UP.The combat is pretty basic and involves nothing too special besides spamming your mouse click and if you like you can use other abilities to kill enemies, however the game is hardly centred around it, the main aspect is the tight controls and seamless gameplay towards the end you'll find yourself ignoring enemies a lot more. Overall it takes around 10-12 hours to beat the game fully with secrets and map exploration etc., it took me 11 hours on my first playthrough, but I am usually a lot slower than most people as I'm fastidious about exploring every nook and cranny, but if you just play the game through and you're not too serious about that stuff it should take you a lot less.All up, Ori and the Blind Forest is probably one of the best games I've ever played and it definitely in my top 5, and it's one of few games I've actually paid full price for and not just bought whilst on sale, believe	 all the positive reviews as they're right, this game is incredible and it's well worth $20.Ori and the Blind Forest is a 10/10."

From its incredibly gorgeous graphics, to its responsive and extremely fun gameplay, once you start playing, you won't want to stop. The story of Ori and the Blind Forest is an astounding and emotional experience, that had me tearing up at times from the connection I had with the characters.

If you're going to be playing this game, I highly suggest turning up the graphics all the way, and making sure you have an amazing display to view the game in its full beauty. As the game progresses in difficulty, you'll start dying more often. When you die, you go back to your last checkpoint, but you can use energy to create a Soul Link, which acts as a checkpoint. You can't make one anywhere, however, so this system cannot be abused to the point of making the game boring. On the topic of boring, I never once became bored with this game. It kept me in until I had to quit out of the session. Even then, I would close my eyes and see the spike plants. The next thing that this game KICKS♥♥♥♥♥with is the soundtrack.

The damn trailer for this game had me gripped- that's how good this game is! After watching the trailer I instantly wanted to buy it, and I eventually did. First of all, I would like to state that this game is absolutely beautiful! The design, artwork, and soundtrack all combine to make an extremely gorgeous game! The bright colours and use of light and dark make the game unexplicably beautiful. The soundtrack is mesmerisingly beautiful- calming, atmospheric, with some more tense and hostile tracks for certain parts. I really can't praise the artwork, design, and music enough- they are all mind-blowingly fantastic, and are definately the best selling points of the game as well as the story.The gameplay is smooth and satisfying. It's a great take on modern platforming games. The controls work just fine, and I had no performance issues apart from crashes in cutscenes (I'll talk about this in the negatives section of this review). Ori gains XP from defeating enemies and finding hidden secrets. The world is mostly open for exploration, and there is much to find throughout this beautiful world. Ori gains new core abilities throughout the game, and XP can be spent on extra skills on an ability tree. The world design is honestly quite stunning- it reminded me a little of ""Rayman Origins"", which also had a very beautifully designed world. The mysterious atmosphere is extremely immersive, and the whole designs and concepts with nature and spirituality are very well done.The story is just so damn poetic, heartbreaking, and lovely! I teared up at certain parts. To sum it up without any give-aways, you are Ori, a white spirit guardian of the Nibel forest. However, the light of the forest has been taken away, and a darkness now broods over the world- leaving everything tainted and evil. Ori must restore light to the world, meeting friends and enemies along the way. The characters are all cute and cuddly, and the relationships between them will bring a smile to your face. The huge dark bird/ owl (named Kuro) is the main antagonist for the game, though there is more to her than we first are led to believe (again- without spoiling anything). One thing I will say about the Kuro bird is that she is sooo creepy- the sight and sound gave me the absolute chills- even in the trailer. The ending to the story was kind of ruined for me because my game kept crashing during the end cutscene- completely destroying the immersion the game had put me in- bringing me to the negatives.Now the negatives- only a few, yet I felt they affected the game quite a bit:Firstly, there are certain sections in the game that you physically cannot return to after completing the section of the story- eg. the Ginso Tree or the Forloin Ruins (there are a couple of others too). This is a big problem for completionists as you literally need to start a new game if you missed out any collectibles or hidden areas. Travelling from one side of the map to the other is also a little tedious at times- fast travel between save wells could have been useful, though the music and the world was so beautiful I didn't mind too much when travelling across the map.Secondly, the crashes..... Ugh this really took the immersion from the game for me. There have been many people online saying they have had the game crash at various parts, For me, it was the cutscenes that continuously crashed. People have found out causes and solutions but it's still been a problem for some.Achievements- steam achievements are buggy as hell. If your game crashes, it will give you random achievements on startup. The achievement for completing the game without dying is (in my opinion) a bit silly as well. Also, some achievements may be bugged meaning you can't get them when you should. For example, I missed out on the achievement for finishing the game as my end cutscene keeps crashing.This game has a couple of long segments that require perfect timings and actions without dying. If you make one wrong move in these sections, you have to start them all over again. While some like this challenge, others will find these moments frustrating.Just a personal one, but whoever placed some of the spikey walls in this game- seriously screw you.Last one- no boss battles. As a platformer with great enemy design, I thought this was rather surprising. The abilities and attacks Ori obtains could have led to some really interesting and complex boss fights that could require you to do combos or specific moves. Yet there weren't any boss fights- again, considering the abilities and mechanics in the game, this was surprising to me.These negatives were very frustrating for me. This game is otherwise a perfect game- a piece of art if you will. While some if these are just nitpicks, the major negatives (mainly the crashes and inability to return to some areas) were just too frustrating and brought the overall score of the game down- I'm giving this game a lower score than I would have thought- only 8.5/10. Whilst still a high score, the game really should have been a 10/10. Considering how much of a masterpiece the rest of the game is, this saddens me to an extent as I loved this game and will definately return to it very soon. Despite this, the overall game is excellent and I had great fun with it. I think a sequel could be possible, though not needed. If the devs are planning a sequel I would suggest making the game longer, more skills to learn/ purchase, adding boss battles, fast travel maybe, and the ability to return to anywhere on the map anytime during the game- even after finishing the story. A story for a sequel could easily be possible I reckon. I would be up for a sequel, though I wouldn't disagree with anyone who would say it's unnecissary.To conclude, Ori and the Blind Forest is a MUST BUY! There are a few small mistakes, as I've stated, though the many large pros completely shove aside the very few small cons. The game is just so beautiful and fun to pass up. I fell in love with this game the moment I watched the trailer- the art design and music is some of the best I have ever heard in a game for a very long time, and make for a truly wonderful and gorgeous game. The story is deep and meaningful- with some tear jerkingly emotional moments to it. If the developers read this, then WHERE IS MY SEQUEL ALREADY DAMMIT?!Worth it at full price- go buy it and experience it for yourself! 8.5/10!"

I have played through it twice already (not that is't that big) and will certainly play though it again.Side scrolling platformers are not my favorite genre. Ori and the Blind Forest, however keeps me interested and entertained.What will leap out at you from the get-go, is the colors, then the level of detail extending way into the background and  the atmosphere it all conveys. A rich, natural world with all sorts of elements to it worth taking a minute to stand still and admire. It is evident this game was made by people who wanted to create an experience beyond just a game.Ori is a nimble creature and even with the basic abilities, it's a joy to jump around, climb and fight off enemies. As you progress, you'll unlock new abilities which will allow you to jump higher, float on air currents, swim and more.There is a some backtracking, but, as you might expect, it will simply give you the opportunity to enjoy the places you've been (and traverse them with new abilities) once more.There are parts where you have to take a deep breath and push to get get through. But when you do (after an accpeptable amount of tries) you'll be elated you made it.The story is not super deep, but good. The game is not long, but satisfactory and very re-playable (€20 is quite fair).Ori is one of (if not truly) my favorite games of 2015. It would definitly make the list of all-time top 10 favorites and I'm not saying it would be at number 10 either.A must-have. Well doone, Moon Studios."

,Recommended,261570,17114027,"Posted: 18 July, 2015",all,satsun,"Ori and the Blind Forest is a side-scrolling adventure game with very little dialogue (I like that) and a skill tree; there will be some dialogue to fill you in on the story but you won't be watching cut scenes or reading pages of text and the skill tree is something you'll use throughout the game that makes your life a bit easier.Early in the game you may need some patience. I found that I had to get used to the controls while navigating some difficult areas, but rest assured that you will eventually gain abilities that make navigation easier. There is a progression in this game that will allow you to reach certain areas, so there will be some back-tracking, but like I said, it will be much easier to backtrack when you've gained your new skills.There may be some frustrating moments in this game, but I found that when I was feeling really frustrated, I was often at the end of the frustrating area so I never was entirely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the game. Also, don't forget to use the abilities that you're given and take into consideration what objects you can use to help navigate difficult areas. I enjoyed the gameplay mechanics because, while it is basically a platformer, it did require a some brainpower to complete.As for the visuals, it's a side-scroller, but it appears to be mostly rendered in ""3D"" (not just flat 2D objects) so it does require a decent GPU to run. I thought that the graphics were done extremely well and for some reason the art reminded me a bit of Odin Sphere.I really liked the audio and felt that it was mixed extremely well. I enjoyed hearing some of the sound effects seamlessly ringing out in the subwoofer. The game does output 5-channel surround and it is very tastefully done.Ori took me just over 13 hours to complete, that is with me getting at least 97% on each area (some backtracking) and I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun side-scroller."

Overall a fantastic platformer, beautifully designed and executed.Pros (and there are oh so many)- Fantastic, painterly art style that matches the theme of the game and does wonders for your immersion.- Crazy good sound design and an amazingly emotional soundtrack that I highly recommend purchasing too.- Level and map design are really great, and give you a sense of immense space to explore. There are dozens of nooks and crannies to wander into and discover.- Puzzles feel great, even if they aren't too difficult. There's no place where I was left completely confused about what to do. The game teaches you how the world works pretty fluidly, but even without having to wonder how to do things the execution of the solutions is still tricky and you get a great level of satisfaction from completing them.- Movement feels amazing (on a controller, I haven't tried a keyboard but I have a hunch it wouldn't feel nearly as good). The animation of the character's movements, jumps, climbs, etc. is detailed and fluid, and whenever you see a sollution to a puzzle it feels effortless to move the way you need. You do have to backtrack through previously discovered areas a bit in this game, very much if you wish to collect everything, but moving around and out-maneuvering enemies feels so nice you won't mind the wandering.- Story is fantastic and really immersive. Not many games bring me to tears (the last being Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons), but this one had me bawling in the intro. Matching the art, sound, and movement to the emotions in the game seems to be perfectly executed every time here.Cons- This is a challenging game. It's not easy for a novice at platforming to get through. Yes, the puzzle solving is relatively straighforward, but the game really challenges your reaction time and execution precision in a few sequences where you run for your life.- Because of those run for your life sequences, this game is stressful. Not merely frustrating, but heart-pounding I will have an anxiety attack sort of stressful. Granted, most of the game is amazingly pleasant and free to explore, but in a few sequences you are challanged to escape from a rapidly deteriorating area. You cannot exit the area and go do something else, coming back when you're ready to try the challenge again. It's now or never. If you made the mistake of entering that challange area before collecting enough health upgrades, say, one or two hits from anything kills you, and boy do they throw everything at you. You are stuck either exiting the game to come back in to the mayhem at another time, or trying over and over again to clear the area. It's meant to be stressful, and they do a good job with that, but if you aren't precice enough or quick enough you end up stuck in these areas for a long time and the 'fun stress challenge' ends up being a nightmare get-me-out challenge. That being said, boy do you feel amazing when you clear it. Not only that, the move patterns you need to get through don't change from attempt to attempt, so you can learn your way through the level and when you have it down it feels like you're flying, dodging everything and fluidly passing obstacles. It feels absolutely fantastic to clear these areas, but until you do you need your patience and energy.-There are collectibles in these challenge areas that you cannot return to once you clear the area. This means that, if you are one of those collectionists that feels the itch to get every item in the game, you will either have to scour each of these areas to make sure you don't miss anything before you get locked out, or look up (and spoil) what the area looks like beforehand to know where you have to deviate from the good path to go get that last pesky xp pickup.Overall, you need to try this game. Even if platforming isn't your preferred way to game (I certainly play platformers only very rarely), you need to try this game. Amazing art, fantastic sountrack, immersive story that never forces you to 'feel' but lets you do it on your own, movement that feels fluid and free, exploration and discovery, and a great challenge. This is one of those games where, after only the intro and first steps out on your own, you know this was done right."

With A Touch of Agitation(No Spoilers)Ori And The Blind Forest has to be one of the better platformers I have played. It has the best art design out of all of them, even better than Rayman which is saying something. The mechanics of the jumping and climbbing are top notch with the occasional mess up, though it doesn't happen often. This game inovated with the jumping off of the projectiles and monstors the way that it happens in this game, It helps switch from slow paced exploring and collecting things to fast paced parkour through a bunch of monsters, and one of my best parts are when you're running from a huge monster or crumbling environment. The sounds aren't too good, but they get the job done. The story -though not the highlight of the game- Is not bad, the ending is predictable but how it happened is not.

But be warned, beneath its veneer of cuteness lies an ABUSIVE platformer.I was expecting something along the lines of a cuter version of Super Metroid or any of its successors (more recently, for example, Axiom Verge), and I got it...in so far as the power up/exploration system was concerned.  But the big surprise was just how much the game is dominated by punishing mazes of instadeath bramble and lava.  If you're old enough to have played the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on NES, and you remember how much fun it was to swim through a maze of fire coral; that's essentially half of the gameplay here.  I found myself feeling the same alternating terror and relief that comes with getting past a heavy platforming section as I have when playing the recent FPS platformer Deadcore.  It is that brutal.Ori is at its best when you are between dungeons (trees?) and can relax while taking in the beautiful scenery and looking for ways to grab just out of reach powerups.  This part of the game is classic Metroidvania, but at times it even feels more natural--even whimsical--because the setting is a gorgeous sprawling forest.  There are also some cool sequences where  you need to leverage enemy projectiles so that you can climb ever higher.  But, unfortunately, in the service of what I consider to be difficulty overkill; these parts of the game are usually layered with copious spikes or other instadeath materials.In recent years I have grown to become a fan of titles with refreshingly punishing difficulty (think Dark Souls, etc.); but this is one case where I feel like less bramble would have meant more fun."

Fantastic sound design, explosive and beautiful soundtrack, graphics that make your eyes melt and the story starts of really sad but turns into one hell of an adventure!And of course, as everyone else has stated; this game is VERY DIFFICULT. Even for me who has played platformers since the early 90's. Not even the latest Rayman games, who I think is pretty hard, is anything compared to the stunts you will perform in this game. It's more or less a trial and error game, so your first play through means ALOT of deaths.Some of the sequences is so fantastic with every great element of the game just exploding in your face. It's hard to even grasp the awesomeness at those points.Ori and the Blind Forest is a must have game and one of the best platformers ever, if not the best. It's a breath of fresh air in these AAA times and games like this is rare gems. The difficulty might make some people crazy, but if you persistent you'll might just pull the whole game off, with great satisfaction. You don't want to miss Ori and the Blind Forest!11/10"

,Recommended,261570,14929919,"Posted: 16 March, 2015",all,AkiraHansJuris,"""Ori and the Blind Forest"" is unquestionably one of the best games I've ever played.The mechanics are solid, well thought out, and damn fun to work with. By the time I had completed the game, I had died 492 times. This game is hard... brutally hard... but when you fail, it's your own fault. No cheap shots, no blind jumps, nothing. You can also save at ANY time, creating a respawn point wherever you are standing to further alleviate the frustation of a particularly difficult section. One of the more interesting aspects is your reliance on enemies. Ori isn't particularly strong, but he is exceedingly agile and clever. Often I found that the most effective strategies relied on tricking enemies into hitting one another, or redirecting bullets to destroy obstacles. Combat becomes a fast-paced puzzle, rather than a boring run through the level. The platforming is fair, and I never had any difficulty distinguishing what I could and couldn't stand on. An ever-expanding arsenal of abilities (wall jump, air dash, double jump, etc.) help keep movement fresh, and make retracing your steps after completing a dungeon an enjoyable ego boost!The game does a wonderful job conveying emotion and character through the player's interaction with the world. At points, the character is slowed down, or animated differently to help drive home the story, which is well integrated with the platforming. You really get attached to Ori, and at points I genuinely felt bad for allowing him to die. Chase sequences are well designed, and are just as heart-pounding as they should be without forcing in a contrived cutscene. They serve equally as a challenge to test your newly acquired skills, and a cinematic moment to carry the story, but be warned, they are by far the most difficult portions of the game.The artwork in ""Ori"" is absolutely without peer. The environment, the characters, just the look of the thing is phenomonal. They convey a sense of grandure and scale, without seeming out of place. Subtle visuals also help make the game easier to understand. Portals joining different parts of the levels will glow when Ori gets near them, showing you which pair is linked. A faint blue trail of energy is visible before performing a wall-dash, helping you know where you'll end up. You simply can not argue that this game isn't beautiful, in both aesthetic, and design.The story is heartfelt and sincere, and I was shocked to find myself in tears only 10 minutes in. While it isn't anything truely innovative in terms of narrative, it's extremely well composed and the delivery is flawless. The entire experience lasted me a solid 10 hours, and I was completely engrossed the entire time, serving as a perfect compliment to the rest of the game.I'm not recommending you play this game, I'm demanding it. If you only have $20 to spend on Steam this year, seriously consider picking up this game."

Everything is so detailed, not just the background, but also the foreground, that you maybe miss something if you don´t watch careful enough. Along with the graphics, the colours are also very pretty. Sometimes they´re bright, sometimes they´re dark, but you´ll never have the feeling that tey are too bright or too dark so they are always just alright.Besides that, the animations are great, too, because they are just so fluently, which brings us to the next part: the gameplay. There is not much to say about, it is just perfect. The control is easy, at least with an gamepad, I´ve got to admit, I don´t have played it with the keyboard.Another thing that I think is remarkable is the soundtrack. No matter what happens, the music always fits the situation and makes you either feel sad or happy, it depends on what has happened.This leads me to the final part of this review, which is the story. I don´t want to spoiler you too much, so all I can say is, that it is very sad, but also simultaneously.Well, that´s it.

76561197993247079,Recommended,261570,14882290,"Posted: 14 March, 2015",all,SWindleFeD,"This game...where to begin.Well let's start with the soundtrack, out of all the games I have played, this one has the most beautiful music I have ever heard along with simple but purely amazing vocals done by Aeralie Brighton and the team she works with (you can find her on twitter using the name @AeralieBrighton btw I highly recommend listening to any of her other great works as they come) after the brief amount of time I spent playing, I left full of wonder something that a game hasn't been able to do in years.The visuals, every single image was hand painted. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.That just goes to show how dedicated this team was to bringing you their vision of this world speaking of which, even the most rotton parts of the game look great I question how I didn't lose myself to just staring at some of the more beautiful scenery.And now for the meat of it all, the gameplay.The controls, simple and flawless I had absolutely no problem with response time and once you unlock some of the abilities I swear you'll enjoy tinkering around with what combos you can do to not only defeat your foes quickly but to use them as a way to travel further and faster than you could to begin with.And another I thing I love is the save mechanic, there are save points set in stone but you can make your own so long as you have the energy to do so (which you will have most of the time unless you've been mucking around too much).These save points are also where you can open up a menu to unlock passive skills for example gaining more health when you lay down a save point.Also while the game can be difficult at times it never feels like you were cheated out of the life you lost, and you almost always learn how t oavoid it the next time.And lastly, the story.It is another simple but flawless execution of the game, I won't spoil too much but you play as something you wouldn't expect to be a hero at first glance.You play as Ori, a little oh so damn adorable creature (even his taking in that first breath after coming back up from underwater is ridiculously cute) that at first can't do much but his quest is to save the ""blind forest"" from a great evil using whatever he can.How would I rate this game?10/10I truly hope this game is left as is and is not milked as I sincerely believe this game is the closest thing we will ever get to perfect for a very long time."

,Recommended,261570,14929475,"Posted: 16 March, 2015",all,Cyril,"""Too hard"" is not a valid complaint. Do people hate Dark Souls for being ""too hard""? No. Do people hate Super Meat Boy for being ""too hard""? No. So why the hell are people getting so pissy about this game being hard?Especially since - and here's the real kicker - /it isn't/.Ori and the Blind Forest is fairly average for a platformer in terms of difficulty. You never need to be too precise and you're given all the chances in the world to make yourself more powerful and durable. Yes, you'll die a lot if you try to beeline to the next objective every single time, I'm sure. If that's your problem? EXPLORE. It's a bloody metroidvania. That's kind of the point. I made sure to explore as much as I could before each dungeon and the end result was a challenging but rarely frustrating platformer metroidvania with gorgeous visuals and a fantastic soundtrack. Honestly I'm not sure what more I could ask for.And the chase sequences aren't really that tough either. You don't need to be that precise on any of them unless you reeeeally don't want to miss a single EXP pickup in the Ginso Tree, and even then it's not that bad. Sure, I died a few times on each of them, but a few deaths on relatively short sections isn't that huge a deal. The only real issues with any of the chases, if I can make any observations, are the rocks falling from the ceiling in the second chase and the last climb in the final chase. The former because it's something you really don't have time to react to and instakills you, and the latter because it can be a bit hard to figure out where you're supposed to be going at the very end, but it's not too hard.And anyways, there's a general rule to be said about this game; if you don't like a particular concept, don't feel too bad, because the game always stays fresh and the developers are more likely to get tired of an idea before you get tired of it. Each time you get a new ability, the game tends to focus on that ability specifically for a little while, but then it's just assumed you know how to use it and the game switches to something else, incorporating that new ability into the mix. Each dungeon has a gimmick of its own that isn't seen anywhere else in the game (portals, gravity shenanigans) which keeps them feeling like big, important areas compared to the main overworld. Basically, through my first 8-hour playthrough, I never got bored of the game at all - it felt over too soon to me.Fortunately, there's plenty of incentive to replay it. And after several more full runs of the game... nope, I'm still not tired of it. I'm likely to come back and do another playthrough in the future, because it's just darn fun to play. And there's certainly plenty to do; 10 main areas and each is pretty meaty. Plus there are always a number of secrets you can't get until later, encouraging revisiting earlier areas.The combat is one thing I've seen as a point of contention as well. What people are missing is that the main focus of the combat isn't attacking but dodging. You autotarget if you're close enough in range, but that means the enemy can likely attack you too, and enemies in this game tend to either fire projectiles or move pretty quickly. Ori is an agile character, but not a powerful one (at first, at least). This works. It fits. Plus, it doesn't take long for other abilities to work their way into combat. The bash is particularly effective at killing enemies, plus it gives the all-powerful invincibility frames, and the stomp is pretty powerful as well. I did have quite a good time with the combat once I really had full fighting potential and it's a great system that never takes the focus off platforming aspects.I'm not going to say the game is without its flaws though. Most notably, the Forlorn Ruins area. It's... a bit of a black sheep compared to the rest of the game. 9/10 areas put the focus on swift, fluid platforming challenges that really require you to think on your feet. Whereas this area requires you to spend a fair chunk of time slowly carrying around an orb that lets you walk on hot machinery and walls/ceilings. The gameplay slows to a bit of a crawl, though about half of it can be cheesed if you're good enough with the mechanics, and it's probably the shortest area in the game, so I can't complain too much.As well, the fact that you can't return to several areas once you've cleared them is a bit of a downer. Main dungeons get sealed off after completion, and most of the Misty Woods area becomes inaccessible after the first time through. And there are some important pickups that can be lost forever. It's really frustrating as a completionist to not be able to 100% the game the first time through because you didn't know which way was forward and you missed out on the bonus pathway.There's also been a lot of reports of bugs or people just getting themselves stuck in impossible areas, neither of which I've experienced myself, but they do seem like a prominent issue; though hopefully one that will get patched out eventually.People dismissing this game as ""a pretty game with little substance"" are certainly entirely wrong in their assumptions, as Ori is a great metroidvania that does well to carve out its own identity aside from being /utterly breathtaking/ to look at and listen to, and I'd highly recommend it. A rare day 1 purchase for me and I don't regret it in the slightest."

Rock-solid controls, non-finnicky physics, beautiful and touching story, ultra-awesome Metroidvania-style powerups and abilities, sweet music and sound design... the list goes on. The only nitpick I have is that not all of the game is that beautiful lush forest you see in some of the screenshots... yeah, I'm stretching here. Nothing to complain about (Maybe it's too easy for hardcore gamers? I found the difficulty on par with VVVVVV, definitely easier than Super Meat Boy). It's everything I want in a platformer and more times a thousand. Oh, and it's pretty. Did I mention it's pretty?"
,Recommended,261570,15225410,"Posted: 5 April, 2015",all,Larexus,"Ori and the Blind Forest is a beautiful and heartfelt adventure that comes with a surprising amount of challenge.--Summary Down below--GameplayOri's gameplay consists of alot of challenging platforming scenarios and exploration. Exploration is key to succeeding through the game, as you will find keystones needed to progress, ability points for upgrading, map stones for helping with exploration, upgrades such as life and spirit increases and the occasional secret area. Getting through alot of these areas can be very difficult and can on the occasion take some trial and error but for the most part it is a skill based game and would attribute most of my deaths to player error as the controls were very responsive and worked smoothly.As you progress through the game you will come into contact with many other abilities that you will need to use to over come challenges along the way as well as open up other areas that were before blocked. Not one of these abilities goes to waste and the level design makes sure you need to make full use of your abilities to progress. Be careful though, if you want to collect everything in the game make sure you do that before completing the final level, because at that point it will not allow you to continue playing that save file.GraphicsThis game is beautiful and well crafted. Travelling through the forests around the spirit tree you become lost in its beauty and this eleviates some of the pain of dying as you get to spend just a little more time in some of these areas. The action scenes were stunning, whether it be climbing for your life from water rushing up below you or running for an exit while burning magma crashes behind you destroying everything in its path you can't help but feel a scense, of wonderment.Every new area is filled with eye candy and just when you thought it couldn't get any more beautiful, the next blows your mind again. Personally my favourite area was the Misty woods. Character designs were well done and unique and the animation and movement of Ori looked smooth. The only design that I felt was lacking in animation was the small birds that dived at you when they seen you.AudioThe music for this game consumed me and brought me into the world they were portraying, from its powerful orchestral song that plays while you are running for your life or the ambience setting music of the Misty woods it brings an experience that would not be the same without it. It was never trying to be spooky or danger driven but more filled with excitement and wonderment. Even after beating the game I can still here that song playing in my head drawing me to want to come and play more.StoryNot going to give much away cause I believe everyone should experience this game. You play as Ori, the last remaing spirit of the once powerful spirit tree that has now had his light taken from it by a shadowed bird that despises the light. Your goal is to revive the light in the areas of the forest to revive the spirit tree and bring life back to the forest.SummaryOri and the Blind Forest is a wondrous adventure that will have you drooling at the beautiful well designed world the developers have created as you try to restore light to the spirit tree and forest. Every new area feels fresh and well crafted and will want you wanting to explore every inch of it. This is a good thing as most of the gameplay revolves around exploration as this will lead to various items that will help you progress through the game or sometimes even a secret area. As you progress you will obtain new abilities that will allow you to go back and progress through previously blocked or unreachable areas, allowing you to reach more of the map. What really bring this world together though is the music design that is top notch and will have you feeling excited and sucked in.All in all this is one adventure I would recommend to anybody and is one of the best gaming experiences I have had in a long time. The mix of beauty, exploration as well as a good amount of challenge make for a top notch gaming experience. Also in my entire first playthrough I ran into no bugs or crashes, other than once my game froze up but I soon realized it was because my windows update was kicking in.. and it returned to normal shortly after. Maybe I'm lucky?"

It is also worth noting that the game has a very innovative (for a jump & run) save feature which practically allows you to instantly save your location/progress at all times - short of time trials within the storyline.The ""Metroidvania"" aspects of the game give you typical progression where the further you go within the main story line the more abilities you unlock which in turn allow you to backtrack and obtain previously unobtainable upgrades. This does not feel tedious at all but is actually fun - a fact which I believe also comes from the way how you can seamlessly explore the world without loading times.This adds even more to the impressive (level) art style when you dash at breakneck speeds using, all your skills, while the scenery changes from an underground spider cave to lush overland greens, rocky passes, etc.Via the in-game save file my very casual play time (did not try to collect everything) was recorded as circa 10 hours, which you might say is not too much.However, considering the price tag AND how I was practically immersed, motivated and glued to the screen over the course of this play time I can high recommend ""Ori and the Blind Forest."""

Ori and the Blind Forest is, perhaps, one of the best games I havbe ever played. When it was revealed during Microsoft's E3 press conference I was immediately intrigued. The art style looked beautiful, the trailer music was perfect... I kept tabs on the game from them until the release. And finally when they announced the hard release date, I couldn't wait. I purchased the game on day 1, full price. And I was not disappointed one bit.The story gripped me, the opening scenes grabbing my heart and then tearing it out.The controls were perfectly fluid, jumping from platform to platform was fun- the varied animations for Ori were cool to see as he bounced through the forest. I love using the different abilities. and figuring out how to use them to reach various areas... I think I may have managed to sometimes use certain abilities to reach areas that may have been much easier accessed if I had unlocked more advanced abilities...THE SOUNDTRACK IS JUST ABOUT THE BEST PART OF THIS GAME. If you haven't yet it's available on iTunes and AmazonMP3 to buy... *waves hand*You WILL buy this soundtrack!However, despite being a near perfect game, well, I hate to say it, but there are a couple things that change this from a completely perfect to a near perfect...-Several times in the story you trigger events which have you attempting to escape certain doom. While these chase sequences are for the most part fun, they do get difficult, and while fun, repeated deaths do make getting through them a chore since there are no checkpoints within them, forcing you to replay the chase again and again.-(this is kind of a minor one) I wish there was a New Game+ or at least be able to wander the forest again- there are a couple areas that I had meant to explore, only to find out that once you leave the region you can't return. This prevents the completionist from searching for the 100%, and if you use the map stones they sit there on your map just teasing you...Other than those two gripes, this game was worth every cent of its $20 price tag. It is a masterpiece; too bad this is Moon Studio's first game- too bad for them, since they already made a near perfect game... how can they top that? for their next project?"

,Recommended,261570,21218878,"Posted: 14 February, 2016",all,MrBollywoggers,"Ori and the blind forest is a must-have game. It's not perfect, but what it does well more than makes up for its flaws. The game manages to create a beautiful world with characters full of personality without the need for words. Its tight controls and challenging gameplay help to create an engaging metroidvania experience. To sum it up in three words:Immersive, Emotional, Tough-as-Nails.Pros:Simply put, Ori and the Blind Forest is hands-down the most beautiful game I have ever played. The whole forest is wonderfully hand-painted, and the quality you see in those trailers isn't just picking the good parts. Seriously. The whole game looks that pretty. The animations are also spot-on, if not as flawless as the environments. It also has some pretty killer parallax scrolling effects. This game is the culmination of 30+ years of 2D art design, as if every 2D game since the beginning has been working to create this level of quality in it's visuals. Absolutely beautiful from start to finish.The music is also amazing. In most cases, it fits perfectly with the gameplay and visuals, helping to sew together a colorful, immersive aesthetic design that makes Ori and the Blind Forest incredibly atmospheric.The characters are brought to life beautifully, and this game is a textbook example of characterization without dialogue. Here's one example from the game that perfecly demonstrates this concept:Naru, the big, motherly creature that adopts Ori, has slow, ponderous walk in which she throws her arms back and forth in a very stylized manner. If you take a look at Ori's walking animation, you will notice that it is almost exactly the same. No matter how different Ori is from Naru, you are reminded that he loves her as a parent figure and keeps a part of her with him wherever he goes. Just from this tiny detail, you can see how close the bond between Ori and Naru is.I'm a fan of metroidvania games, so Ori's gameplay was very good in my opinion. As with any good metroidvania, there are plenty of interesting areas to explore and satisfying powerups to collect, and for the most part the game leaves you free to advance the plot at your own pace. It's also suprisingly hard. In this game, you will die. A lot. It even keeps count for you (I died 404 times in my first playthrough).Cons:Let me start out by saying that Ori and the Blind Forest is an EXCELLENT game. Moon Studios definitely deserve your money, so please don't let me persuade you not to buy this game.In certain parts of this game, collectibles necessary for 100% completion are located in one-time areas. By one-time areas, I mean sections where you cannot backtrack and are locked when you complete them. This is unacceptable. This is the one flaw with this game that cannot be overlooked. A good metroidvania should never do this to their players. Either: 1) don't put collectibles in one-time areas 2) Don't create one-time areas 3)Let the players know when they are entering a one-time area so that they know to be sure to get the collectibles. Ori and the Blind Forest does none of these things, so I highly suggest that you look up the missable collectibles if you're aiming for 100%.Now that that's out of the way, here are a few miscellaneous nitpicks:I would have appreciated a more even difficulty curve. The hardest part of the game can be found very early on (The Ginso Tree), and I would have appreciated it if the devs would have ramped up the difficulty on the rest of the game to compensate. The Ginso Tree was actually my favorite level, and I would have liked more difficulty on the rest of the ""bosses"", especially the finale.You won't be able to play this game for very long at a time. You are a glowing dot with a glowing dot friend that shoots glowing dots at other glowing dots that turn into glowing dots when they die. It's easy to lose Ori in the mass of bright colors, and it actually began to give me a heachache after more than an hour of playing at a time.The forest setting is pretty generic, and I would have appreciated the game putting more distinction between the areas other than just changing the color filter and music."

Its both a calm but pressuring 2d Platformer that will keep you at the edge of your seat, trying to survive the many perils that plague the Blind Forest. You take the form of Ori, a little orphan whose story will be told from a perfectly integrated and non intrusive narrative, amazingly depicting what was, and how is the forest in which Ori resides.But because of this very beauty, Ori and the Blind Forest is very heavy on your common laptop or desktop, therefore expect some lag during the most intense cutscenes or congregated stages. Nothing to worry about but something that should be kept in mind.It allows you to revisit old areas as you learn new abilities, has a very well done lvling system, self explainative and easy to understand. Still the difficulty can be very unforgiving to whoever is not familiar with platformers. That being said, death is not as unforgiving, as the punishment is small.In short, Ori and the Blind Forest is a beautiful gem with a story just as beautiful that should not be, by any reason, overlooked, wether you are a fan of platformers or new to the genre,"

The visuals and soundtrack alone made this game a must buy for me and when the time of release finally came out I found myself succumbing to the beauty of this gem more and more with every steps I took in the forest of Nibel together with the lovable and kind light spirit that is Ori. Some may say that I am ""Biased"" but honestly I knew nothing about what kind of game this would be besides what I've seen from the trailers, I had high expectations and for me they were all met.Perhaps this style of game won't appeal to you as it did for me but If you are one of those who enjoys a game that can provide the feels, a good story, breathtaking visuals and soundtrack, along with a good challenge?? Then Ori is for you~ It has a lot to offer for 21,99$, personally I feel that it is nearly given away at such a low price for the quality it offers. Four years in the making is nothing to scoff at and this gem deserves all the attention it can get.You may find yourself dying repeatedly in certain parts of the game specially If this style of game proves to be more challenging to you (Or If you lack a controller I cannot fathom how difficult playing this game on a keyboard would be), I did as well on my first playthrough and completed the game with well over 280 something respawns If my memory is correct. But remember this: Practice makes perfect~ If you have the will to see this game through to the end I guarantee you shall not be disappointed by the experience. The difficulty of this game may not appeal to all but it is well worth the purchase, that is without a doubt. <3This concludes my review of Ori and the Blind Forest~ I doubt my review will have any sort of impact on your decision to buy the game or not but I certainly hope it has made interest towards this game grow within you. Lastly I wish to give my most heartfelt thanks to those who made this game come to life, you've given us all a masterpiece to enjoy and cherish~ I look forward to your future projects Moon Studios. |_|-Limit Out-|_|"

,Recommended,261570,20273622,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,Qu33n0f1c3,"I was introduced to this game by my brother, who bought and played this on his Xbox One. We are both long time fans of Nintendo and Metroid, and he said to me, ""This is the best 'Metroid' game we've had in years."". He told me I had to play it. I said I'd get to it when it went on sale on Steam. It did. I bought it, but I didn't play. One night, he thrust the Xbox controller in my hands and demanded, ""Play."" I did. And then I finally played it, and I was overwhelmed by nostalgia, beauty, and mirth, for I died many times to silly things. After that, I picked up the game here on Steam, replayed through the first half of the game, and went on to beat it. The 'hype' for this game is real. It is worth every minute you put into it, even if you're just jumping around as little Ori for the sake of playing and enjoying the atmosphere.Some have called this game rage-inducing, too hard, or punishing on the player. These are perhaps true, at least to a degree. Rage-inducing? Sure, I was pretty frustrated escaping the Ginso Tree. Too hard? There sure were parts that ramped up the difficulty, especially around the final third of the game. Punishing on the player? What game -isn't-? If you don't die a few times and learn from your mistakes, where is the challenge of a game?The fact is, this game is not for everyone. If you're a casual gamer and don't like trying different methods to get through a section, by all means, pass up playing--BUT WATCH A LET'S PLAY for the experience. But, most other players should be able to get through this just fine. Yeah, you might die a thousand times (not even joking there), but the heart-warming message of the story is worth every minute of game play. The fact is, this game didn't need to happen (you'll understand if you've experienced the story). And that's the beauty of it.Please do yourself a favor and give this game a chance. If you're on the fence, watch someone else play it. Just experience this game. It'll kick you in the feels."

,Recommended,261570,14943228,"Posted: 17 March, 2015",all,[TCR] CraftyWalrus,This is a decent game. I want to say that it's excellent but incredibly floaty controls and unbelievable difficulty spikes ruin most of the fun and completely distract me from the incredible art design. It is almost unreal how many new concepts they throw at you per section and they have almost zero explanation. It took me HOURS and multiple breaks and a mistake to figure out the puzzle in the Gumon area (forgot the name because I forgot everything due to the blind fury this game causes). I recommend this game if you appreciate a beautiful artstyle not seen in many games and if you are VERY patient. If you get frustrated or angry stear clear of this game.
,Recommended,261570,19510014,"Posted: 5 December, 2015",all,Doctor Blue,"One of the most beautiful games I've had the good fortune to play. Gameplay-wise, this is a definite Metroidvania-style game. Your character collects new abilities and skills throughout play to get to new areas, there's hidden goodies abound, achievements for finding all the secrets (or speedrunning the game), etc. There are a few fairly unique combination of mechanics in this game for movement and combat, to which I was pleasantly surprised. Controls are rather fluid and natural (I played on an Xbox 360 controller). It's on the short side (I completed the story close to 100% in under 10 hours), but it uses its time wisely. Plus, if you are one to go after achievements, there's definite replayability.The biggest selling points for me, however, are the story and the graphics. As I said at the start, this game isgorgeous. In presentation, art style, animation, fluidity, music, voices, everything. I'll be picking up this soundtrack for sure, to listen out of game. If you want to pose an argument for whether or not a game can be a work of art, this should be your Exhibit A.The story is a simple one, but that's not to be taken in a bad light: There is no filler, and it tells all it has to tell with the time that's given to it.In short: Like Metroidvania games? Want to go on a little roller coaster of emotion while experiencing something visually stunning, with a matching soundtrack to boot? Play this game. Absolutely fantastic."

From the gorgeous artwork to the excellent soundtrack and the fluid gameplay. It took me about 1 hours to really get into the game, because the introduction takes its time and the game has a smooth difficulty-curve, making the first chapters pretty easy. After that, the game picks up and throws challenging and interesting passages at you. The Level and Art-design is just brilliant. The transitions between areas are seemless and the world really feels like one big, interconnected forest. This is of course thanks to the gorgeous artwork. I love hand-drawn 2D games and this game shows me once again, why i do so. Everything looks just as it should be. There is no texture that doesn't have a high enough resolution, no mesh that should have a few more voxels. It's just exactly as the artist envisioned it and the vision is beautiful. The Soundtrack completes the whole thing with an awesome main-theme that reappears here and there in climactic passages, but doesn't make the mistake of being too pushy. The gameplay is also really good and every new ability you gain over the 8-10 hours of gameplay gives way to interesting new puzzles and challenges. The combat, while still well made, may be the weakest point. The very bright and flashy effects sometimes make you lose track of what is actually going on, but that's just a minor drawback, since the head-on-fight is not the focus of this platformer. In conclusion:+beautiful+gorgeaus+perfectly fitting soundtrack+fast-paced+challenging+surprisingly good story+light dash (trust me, this one move made for the most awesome moments)-sometimes overwhelming effects-your energy and life get rather pointless later on"

It runs noticably smoother besides Unity's own shenanigans.I've been hyped to play this since it's debut at E3 2014. Thank God it wasn't an Ecksboned exclusive.Really good Metroid-Vania game, plus some MM/Rockman elements, including the walljumping (MMX) and instagib beams and surfaces. The Bash move is pretty new to me though, and quite fun - I also like how physically accurate it is, exchange of energy (notjustvelocity) and all that. Other than that all the abilities are well implemented and quite inspired. All of them see good use well into the endgame, besides the basic ""gun."" No speedbooster, but the powerful shinespark-like properties of superjump take its place quite well.The sprite layering is bad af, especially how it cascades to reveal other portions as if it were a model (but it's not), the progressively changing world hearkens back toMetroid IIIand then some, and the music is really good, although I'm more of a breakbeat/techno kind of guy(EDIT: I bought it. My review is on the respective page for the DLC). Overall the entire world was really nice. Even at 1080HD I was able to get like 50+ frames at normal combat portions (normally I have to go windowed and lower the res because of my aged rig), and the zero-framedrop nature of the renderer gave me friggin bullet time during high-intensity events like escape sequences, but it beef'd my cutscenes.EDIT: After playing it again, I'm seeing just how detailed the layering even is. Like, we're talkingat leastseven to twelve layers per region. Moon did not ♥♥♥♥ around with the deets.The game is just full of very well-designed environments, obstacles, and puzzles. Some absolutely require you to think outside the box.My beefs are:Your basic weapon can't be manually targeted using the mouse or right analogue stickCan't remap controlsYou can't use the bumpers as well as the triggers for their respective uses (I have a Logitech F310 and it makes my fingers hurt because of how many pounds the triggers require)Jumping with an object requires absolute accuracy at a certain part in the wind temple or you'll drop on the spikes or that stinkin' cannon. There is no room for error.EDIT: On that last note, if you have triple jump you can skip this part in it's entirety. Go to the big platform in the middle, jump, glide, bash, jump again. Easy peasy; in fact, you may not need tri-jump at all.All of the above can be lampshaded or compensated for somehow. While you cannot remap controls, the gampad setup was well though-out.EDIT: A note to add is that I felt the game to be a very refreshing change from the usual VS stories, along with certain gameplay changes like the utter lack of boss fights and the fact that escape sequences do not have checkpoints, which, honestly, reminds me of Descent 1&2, because if you beef it while the reactor is going critical, the matcen for your ship won't work and all your goodies are bathed in a funeral pyre.9 outta ♥♥♥♥in 10, honestly.

Stunning graphics and beautiful music took my attention right away from the first moments and soon after that I was amazed by the buttery smooth and fluid gameplay mechanics.Game is very intuitive and easy to approach due to the minimalistic design, but it did get quite hard from time to time. This is no easy game. At least for me since I'm no platformer expert. I died about 600 times (I made some very silly mistakes a lot) during the 13h it took for me to pass the game and I'm not even mad. Because the fact you can save the game practically anywhere and the few hundred milliseconds it takes to respawn makes continuing the game so effortless.Story in this was very good too. It's quite rare to see story of this depth in a platformer game. The accompanying music definitely made it even more emotional. Kudos for Gareth Coker for making such a beautiful and powerful score.All in all everything was just so smooth in this game. It took me by surprise and I couldn't stop playing once I started. Ihighlyrecommend this if you're into platformer genre at all. It really doesn't get much better than this.I give Ori and the Blind Forest 10/10."

The simple mechanics needed to navigate the world in he style of a Metrovania platformer makes this an easy game to pick up for even the most inexperienced player. As I went from area to area, the new environments, enemies, and power-ups increased the difficulty but made it so much more interesting as well.A small complaint, however, is the laggy feeling you get as you approach certain areas in the game but overall the game flows smoothly throughout the majority of the run.An interesting game to say the least and one I enjoyed immensely I would recommend this game to anyone who likes 2D platformers or even those with a strong atraction to story-driven games.

Colorful, oozing with sort of comfy atmosphere, every level is a pure joy to lool at! The game is 2D, but the backgrounds are always moving, adding multi-layer depth to every scene. And most of the levels change visually in a big way as you progress through the game!Gameplay-wise, this is a platfomer. There is nothing revolutionary here, but everything is very well put together and in the end the usage of every mechanic feels natural and really satisfying. Controls feel really tight, which is important in a game where precision is required.There are no loading times and no separate levels - you have a single big world divided into zones thematically. You can not freely run around every zone from the start - in most cases you need a certain ability to fully explore this zone or the other (in metroidvania fashion). Generaly I do not really like games that do this, because this means you will have to backtrack a lot. In this case that never happened to me because of two reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned before, most zones visually change in a big way during the main story. Secondly, newly gained abilities often give you means to cut through the old levels much much MUCH faster then before. All in all, I never felt any problems with the metroidvania-esque natura of the game.Ori And The Blind Forest is 6-8 hours long and does not outstay its welcome in any way. You will be stunned by the visuals, you will be charmed by the simple, but touching storyline, and you will enjoy yourself while jumping, climbing and flying in the most stylish ways possible.

Very nice routing of the player, retraversal of previous locations in new ways and with new abilities. Not too heavy-handed on the puzzles. Save mechanic creates some interesting tension during the first half, but becomes more convenient later on, which is necessary as the difficulty ramps up harshly. Upgrade system felt meaningful enough to encourage currency collection.Some negatives - over-use of spike hazards, some sections of the game feel like you're playing Operation. A few forced-progression sections requiring rote memorization and death cycles. Ori is sometimes lost in FX spam. Some non-deterministic elements to timed sequences - you can be playing well and still simply get unlucky. A little too much pixel-perfect platforming for a floaty player package, as well as occasional edge-case jumps - i.e., ""I made that jump but it didn't quite feel like what I was supposed to do... am I going the right way?""All of the above negatives are washed over by the high quality of the experience in general.

On top of that my Steam library is not that extensive compared to many game collectors, as my preference in games is somewhat particular. With all that being said, I can safely say this is one of the best indie games I have ever played.First, the knitty-gritty of it: you're going to die. A lot. This is not an easy platformer by any means, especially if you are looking to collect everything, and it was created with that in mind. Every single obstacle, puzzle, and area is set specifically with certain abilities in mind. Attempting to traverse more 'advanced' areas without progressing properly will result in many many deaths, and the kicker isTHE GAME KEEPS TRACK OF THE # OF DEATHS.Now,THAT BEING SAID, it is not completely impossible to get around these areas, and that's what makes this game so fun. The story helps you progress in a linear fashion like most platformers, while also allowing you to freely explore as much as you're physically capable of (gaining/upgrading said abilities helps with this). Timing, reflexes, precision, and patience are all keys to successfully getting through this craziness, with gameplay mechanics being responsive and itchy at the same time. But through all the attempts, deaths, expletives, and misery you'll spend trying to get over one specific obstacle, the elation you will feel after overcoming it isincredible. No matter how many times I died, no matter how many times I wanted to face-smash my keyboard; I was never once put-off or disallusioned; this beautiful world continued to engross me.EVERYTHINGyou hear and read about this game is true. From the moment you launch the game (especially the opening scene: it was freakin' Marley and Me all over again dammit) to the closing credits, it will all pull you deeper into the game, creating one of the most memorable experiences you could ever imagine. TheSOUNDTRACKis phenomenal, adding yet another detailed layer on top of an already vibrant experience that tugs at your heart-strings. It'll definitely hit you in the feels department. The story is charming while also deep, creating a more immense setting than one might initially expect. The artwork and visuals areSTUNNINGas well, providing a rich, colorful, and unexpectedly layered environment. All the typical platformer tropes; it takes these, deconstructs them, and creates something delightfully new and refreshing, while still channeling and tempering the core platformer values. Everything is so perfectly tied together in this game, and I cannot recommend it enough.BUY IT, PLAY IT, LOVE IT."

Amazing visual display, captivating story that grabs you from the first second through the end of the game.

With Ori you Can grind if you choose, but it is not neccessary, nor does it feel that way. Also enjoy that there are no ""dead ends"" Every path leads somewhere or to something.Absolutly recommend this to anyone who wants to just play a game they will completely enjoy. While majority of the game is relativly easy, there are very challanging parts, but never hit a point ot trus frustration.Ori plays intuitivly and while similar to other games stands on its own for the pure beauty that is the entire game.

It alleviate the problem I often have with platformer : doing the same part over and over again just to get a little further every time. In Ori, when you save, you consume energy. So if you manage your energy right (which is not hard to do) you can basically save whenever you want. So you essentially ""choose your checkpoint"". I really liked that system.

Ori and the Blind Forest took that dedication to its limit; getting 100% in it was an episode in torture. On the bright side, I feel now like I'm fairly qualified to leave a review for this lovely game. For a beautiful game it is, despite, or perhaps because of, its difficulty. Every time I replayed it for different achievements (I had separate playthroughs to obtain Immortal, Elite, and Supersonic, for no deaths, no skill points, and under three hours respectively), I saw something I hadn't seen before, discovered a better solution to a puzzle I didn't previously conceive. That power of Ori and the Blind Forest to continually delight speaks volumes to its power in both gameplay and storytelling. At times, the distinction between the two did not at all seem distinct; the gameplay itself feeds the story, in areas such as the Misty Woods, or the Forlorn Ruins, names that might sound alien to you now, but you will grow to both love and hate should you play. ;)tl;dr if you replay to 100% this game, you might feel absolutely overwhelmed, but the thrill of the achievements and the power of its story to constantly amaze make it positively worthwhile.I should also like to add that Ori and the Blind Forest was the first platformer video game I ever played. Accordingly, the learning curve was fairly steep. But if I could go from a 28 hour first playthrough down to a sub three hours fourth playthrough, so can you. ;)"

There are even scenes in this game that give ya the feels.  However, whats a review without giving details on what makes this game so great.Soundtrack - I'm a huge sucker when it comes to a great soundtrack.  You know it's good when you can't stop listening to the songs.  It's up there at #2 on my list (the others being Kingdom Hearts and Undertale).  The music blends together with the environment and specific events in the game.  Every song has the same melody in it, but feels unique in it's own way.  Although my all time fav song in the sound track is ""Restoring the Light, Facing the Dark,"" very well put together.Art Style and Environments - The visuals in this game are insane.  Where can I find the artists? I'd like to learn some of their techniques!  The game has beautiful foreground, background, and everything in between.  Colors for the enviornments are well crafted and inserted where they need to be.Difficulty - I'm not much of a platformer myself, but the difficulty in this game is not too easy, not too hard, but just right.  However, the game is no cake walk, it has it's difficult moments.  Certainly not for casual gamers looking for easy games.  Any gamer that can handle super challenging Mario Maker levels can complete this game with no trouble.Narration - This game is one of the few that rely heavily on it's visual narration.  It's executed perfectly!  You can tell from the characters actions how they think and what their personalities are like.  During the course of the game, there is text narration told from the spirit tree, who's kind of like the overseer of the world.  Overall, very well executed visual narration.Immersion - This game will have you immersed in it for quite a while.  I almost completed my first playthrough in one night.  This is also the type of game you wouldn't mind playing over again from time to time.  Even though you've seen the emotional scenes a few times already, they still get to you.  Immersion, 10/10 in this game.Gameplay - Last but not least, gameplay.  A very crucial thing to get right in every game.  However, this game manages to combine RPG like elements into a platformer seamlessly.  Plus the abilities you unlock as you travel through the game give you access to new areas.  They also give you new ways to kill enemies and use their projectiles to your advantage.  In short, this game knows how to execute gameplay.  Nothing in this game is mundane or a chore of a task.These six elements of this game blend together perfectly.  It can give you a sense of tranquility, but can suddenly turn into utter panic at times.  The final score of this game is a 10/10, a must have and an eventual classic.  The only thing that I can say about this game is... Ori is just adorable.  I can't wait to see what other games Moon Studios will make.  They have made a great first impression for their companie's name.  You got my support for any future games Moon Studios!"

What you see in the trailer is exactly what you get as far as visual and acoustics go. Instead, I’ll focus on more what can be harder to discern: gameplay.Gameplay mechanics start out pretty simple early in the game. You can walk, jump, and shoot projectiles that’s about it. As the game progresses you gain more abilities to augment controls already in place: wall jumping, gliding, climbing, multiple shot bursts, stomping, etc.Most of the challenge of the game comes from precision jumping (not enemy fighting) which can just be painful. You will go from easy areas that are fun for casual players immediately to areas that are nightmarish in their obstacles (enemies, projectiles, spikes, or long sequences of precision jumping with no save points).For me (a more casual player), the frustratingly difficult escape sequences are the worst part of the game. In fact, if you are unwilling to die at least fifty (50) times attempting to get through them, don’t buy this game. These sequences are painful. No saves, so many ways to die, and way longer that they should be considering the difficulty involved.Additionally, wall-jumping and climbing can be finicky. I am attributing this mainly to human error on my part but several other reviewers have mentioned it as well. So be prepared to save up some energy before what look like ‘challenging’ jump areas to create a save point and you’ll be fine (though the death toll will climb).PS: There is no difficulty setting, you get what you get.EDIT: Let me clarify, since apparently comprehension is lacking in some people.This review is for the ORIGINAL version of the game. I do not have the Definitive Edition, it's not out, I don't know if I'll buy it and therefore will have NO idea if my concerns with the game are addressed.ALSO, this is a review from a CASUAL gamer, with cautionary advice for other CASUAL gamers.

While I already knew I wanted to buy it, I was reading reviews just to see what people thought. I could not keep myself from tearing up at the prologue. One of the most amazing prologues I've seen in a game. The fact that they can produce enough character development within the first ten minutes of the game to bring tears to your eyes is a marvel...AND OMG, WHY DOES ORI HAVE TO BE SO FREAKING CUTE?! Every time I saw Ori get picked up by Naru, I couldn't help but smile. Has got to be one of the cutest main characters I've seen in a while.In terms of actual gameplay, the combat system was very well executed, yet still challenging. I love the abilities that you learn throughout it, and the mobility that they offer. The sequences at the end of the dungeons are very difficult, and very fun to beat.As I've seen some others mention, the game takes about a good 8-10 hours if you search for as many secrets / powerups as possible, which is a great amount of time.A side note, as others have mentioned. YOU CANNOT PLAY FROM YOUR SAVE FILE IF YOU FINISH THE GAME.

But since judging a game by it's look isn't going to work, I might have to add that the story behind Ori's travel is not any less emotional than the music created for this game.On your way, you unravel the sad past of the forest, the role you play in, solve many mysteries to finally be able to restore the forest to it's former glory.Even though you start off with not much, you'll learn new abilities to help you move on, fight enemies and clear paths to hidden treasures. The controls to do so feel very smooth, and controlling Ori is quite enjoyable, and doesn't instantly makes you ragequit because your character moved a step too far, or didn't jump on command.But even so, Ori and the Blind Forest might be a gem in it's whole, but it's a gem the developers want you to earn in it's full. I have to admit, it is a hard game. Especially playing it the first time, you'll find yourself dying quite a lot, but it's nowhere impossible. It might get you frustrated a couple of times, it might not, but either way, it keeps being a fun and loveable game.I probably missed a lot of praise for this game, but to be honest, it is definately worth more than 20 bucks.The atmosphere, the graphics, the playstyle and your way of interacting with your environment, and especially the music, just a few things that will make you love this game.My greatest thanks to the developers for giving us such amazing game, and please, give the guy who voiced the Spirit Tree a bonus."

Ori and the Blind Forest, at the moment of this review, was ten whole hours of my most memorable gaming experience in a long while. I'll sum it all up as such; the visuals are gorgeous, the gameplay is a blend of fun and challenge (only a precious few areas of the game started giving me unwanted flashbacks to I Wanna Be the Guy, and mostly in the endgame at that), and the story is simple and very touching.The absolute worst that I can really say about the game is that it came to an end - I just wanted it to keep going and going. Moon Studios crafted a setting that is ripe with stories to tell, and I well and truly hope to see more of Ori and his/her(?) world in the coming times. They spent four years building this masterpiece, and I'm sure I'm not alone in wanting to see it soar to great heights.Did I mention that I played through the whole game twice in four and a half days?

A true gem in the midst of the many dull/mediocre video game releases we see these days. It's more than a game, it's an EXPERIENCE.HIGHLY recommended, even at its full $20 price.Game length: 6h 21m, first playthrough- Missing 1 collectible and a handful of secret locations.- A fair amount of backtracking to find collectibles involved.- Not that much of 'stopping to see the sights'.Quick notes:1. Visuals and audio are AMAZING.- Foreground and background art are a joy to look at. Environments/levels are diverse yet all very outstanding. The screenshots on the store page are enough to sell the whole game - it did for me.- Sounds effects have a lot of ""boom"" and ""oomph"", was truly a pleasant experience (understatement) playing the game at a high volume.- Noticeably exceptional soundtrack, complement the game sequences wonderfully.2.1. Challenging game (though not unfairly so).- Not as simple as most other games. Expect to die quite a lot.- No ""free"" saves, require a resource. However, this resource is fairly abundant, and common enough to act as a 'quick save' mechanism.2.2. Certain troublesome portions of the game may lead to a fair degree of frustration and cussing.- A lot of repeating sequences on failure (no saves in between).- Little room for error, may prove quite a challenge for most players.3. Some ""boring"" (relative to a player's tolerance/opinion) backtracking involved for power-up/collectible finding."

The music complements everything perfectly, tying it all together (possibly one of the most beautiful soundtracks for a game ever?), and adds to the fantasy-feel of the game. The controls and new abilities are easy to master, but not so easy as to make you feel like you're playing a kid's game either. I initially bought this game thinking, ""Well, this should be relaxing to play"" - and it was! ...except for the parts where I died about 100 times trying to do one thing. One particular escape-scene left me with a stomach ache and shaking hands when I'd finally managed it (I only died 170 times trying, so no biggie).I suppose the only thing that bugged me a little at the end is that you can't go back and try to collect all the items you missed along the way, but that's just a small quibble.Overall: a beautiful, well-made, immersive and amazing game, that will have you wanting to play it again and again. 12 out of 10 - just astounding."

Not only can't I name a major flaw, but I'm struggling to find any flaw at all, and while that may sound ridiculous, please keep in mind that I'm not saying the game is perfect... Although it pretty much is. As far as Metroidvania games go, Ori is the benchmark that all previous & subsequent titles should be measured against. It achieves everything it sets out to do with flying colours, surpassing its contemporaries in ways I previously deemed unimaginable.Very few works of fiction can transmit a real emotional impact in such a short period of time, but Ori manages to do so within the first ten minutes of the game starting. Not only does it manage to hit such a high note very early on, but somehow continues to carry it throughout the game, without it ever feeling shoved in your face through pages of dialog or lengthy cinematic cutscenes. There's some highs, lows, and bittersweet moments all expertly told through exciting gameplay, incredible art, and perfectly matching music.I'm not new to Metroidvania style games, nor am I new to platformers, so while I can appreciate that the game doesn't do a whole lot new in terms of gameplay, I still found myself smiling with glee as I unlocked new abilities. Controlling Ori is an absolute dream, with the movement being some of the best in any game out there, accompanied by some charming abilities, perfectly balanced to give a challenging but fair experience. It's never not enjoyable, and regardless of game length, that's something worth applauding.And the art... The art! There's obviously games out there with more technical gizmos going on behind the image, but I can't point to a single more beautiful game than Ori and the Blind Forest. A simply unforgettable, beautifully designed world with a variety of locales and an insatiable attention to detail left an impression on me like few games could ever dream of. What's even more amazing is that the OST, while stunning in its own right, matches up with the art perfectly to create something truly special.When breaking Ori down into its core components, nothing sticks out as the weakest link. It's a combination of excellence, united together to form one of the greatests gaming moments."

The scenery is complex, and hiding little dandies that may be of hand. The background, even, gives hints to places - though not many, still great. The music blends wonderfully with the locations, even if there are a bunch of monsters out there and about. Then there are the characters. You only play as 1, not like it changes anything. Really, there are only 4 characters - including Ori, the protagonist you play as in this game. I'm not going to say any of the other ones, though you might already know them through some way. Difficulty and gameplay? The system for the energy and health are at first, hard to get used to. But as you play on, it feels like it's barely there. More so the energy than the health, which is clearly eyed on. Which is however, a little disappointing. Overall though, I still enjoyed this game. Something about it hooked me into it, and although once you complete the game you can't continue the same save (which just means you can choose another save slot, out of 10 slots), and the difficulty curve is rather a couple of waves, the bright lights and the music stands out of the crowd."

If you want an unbiased review good luck have fun finding one :P. I have done my best to have no spoilers.I’m breaking my usual silence and letting my voice join the masses here and to put it simply:This game is a Masterpiece.The sound track and artwork is what got my attention with this game, and so I promptly broke my own rule and bought it “judging a book by its cover”. I was thankfully not disappointed and believe the music and art alone is worth the money paid. The music is moving and at times emotive, setting a great atmosphere for the game. The art work and design compliments this brilliantly and is beautiful, vibrant and diverse. It just drew me in.The story itself is simple but moving (some might say cliché) and I feel keeps the game rolling nicely. The intro especially tugged at my heart strings. I don’t usually sentimental over games (I’m not even sure if an adult getting emotional over a game is a good or bad thing) but this game succeeded for me and did its job well.As for the gameplay… I don’t usually play platformers (metriod/castlevania games) but again I found it highly enjoyable, while challenging at the same time, and it may have converted me to the genre.  You start off with nothing to begin with, but as you progress through the game you slowly (or quickly if you’re speed running) unlock more abilities and skills to help you progress and unlock previously inaccessible secrets, keeping the game steady, entertaining and interesting.I must warn you however, that there are some pretty steep difficulty spikes in the game. There are even a couple of areas in the game which are completely insane (you will know them when you find them). They will render all (but the most veteran and skilled) gamers, banging heads against keyboards, smashing controllers and using words they didn’t know existed. However these areas and difficulty spikes are NOT impossible. With a little practice, possibly a lot of repetition and a new controller, you will get the hang of it, eventually beating these difficulty spikes and areas. When you do, it is immensely satisfying and rewarding (made me feel elated – I actually danced a jig for not dying on my 67th attempt at one point :P).In summary, I believe this game is an absolute gem, well worth the money and would recommend it to anyone. It successfully dragged me away from my other games, which is an achievement the game should be proud of. My main advice is to take your time on the first play through, enjoy the scenery, enjoy the game and don’t give up. Oh and playing with a controller is highly recommended.I’ve never done a review before so sorry for any mistakes and if it was too long.  Thank you for taking your time reading."

The visuals, the music, the difficulty and progression through the game. Everything is so perfect!!!The immersion in this game is mind blowing, my sister was calling me over and over and i just couldnt hear her. Until she approached me from behind and scared the living crap out of me.I dont even have headphones that block out sounds, my mind was just too hooked on the game.The only bad thing i can come up with is that the framerate occasionally drops and breaks the flow of the game which is pretty frustrating. You try to make a difficult jump and then sudden lagspikes just messes up your moves. Maybe its just my computer messing with me but i just wanted to add that little problem.TL;DRJust get this game, there are no other platforming games out there that can beat this gem of a game(CBFD comes close)."

Despite the skill level needed for it I had a lot of fun with it. I'm playing back through it to get 100% and probably again for other achievements.This is the kind of game that you try again and again just to reexperience the magic of that first play through.

,Recommended,261570,21245386,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,Mitzey,"Just finished the game, where to begin this review...Ori and the blind forest is a very well developed game with outstanding visuals, music and most certainly story development. I have to say that moon studios has really done a good job with developing the story and characters for this game. Mostly going from its awesome level design to its extremely challenging levels that show up at each stage of the game. As you progress though the story you tend to really get a emotional feel for the story that really grabs your attention into playing the game (especially at the start). Meanwhile at many stages you are faced with very fair challenges that bring excitement and thrill to the game. With this in mind I did feel a really good connection in terms of the feel and looks of the game alongside its story. However it does seem like a shame that once the game is completed, you can never return to your save, which is a downside if you didn't finish all of the levels completely (as I have done). Though the ending leaves you off with many mysteries and questions unanswered, I feel that many can be answered by the player them self or by moon studios (if at all). It all really depends on what they have in store for their upcoming DLC ""The Definitive Edition"" which as they say, will be a final polish on the game. I look forward to any future games to be released by Moon studios and I look forward to any kind of details on the DLC to be later released ""spring 2016""Side note: The only thing I can say is I will miss this game.. (and it's story)To sum up the pros:-Brilliant Story-Beautiful Visuals-Amazing Soundtrack-Easy to learn controls-Awesome abilities (plenty of wall-jumping)-Very good Character Development-Hard but possible Challenges-Emotional roller coaster (Hang on tight!)-Very clever Platformer-You will fall in love with this game (if not... well that's your opinion)-Plenty of achievements for those who seek themSome cons:-Save file locks after the game is completed (So go and explore before you finish it!)-Story ends off with unanswered questions (be prepared for fanfictions if any)-some VERY minor optimization issues (small stutters here and there, not game-breaking)"

The art style is so beautiful, the soundtrack absolutely amazing, and the story the game is telling very sweet and lovely.It can be quite frustrating at some points (I ragequit the game very early on and didn't wanna play it for a week; only to then complete the rest of the game in one sitting), but it definitely gets easier the more you play - even though the game itself gets harder the further you progress. Usually I'm not a huge fan of platformers, but this game had me hooked instantly - for the above mentioned reasons.You get to spend your skill points just as you like, and you can explore and revisit areas - despite mission goals - completely freely most of the time (with the exceptions of three areas that you can't revisit) once you learn the required moves to access them.The controls are very easy and not complicated at all, though you can't remap them if you wanted to.Also, some of the achievements are kinda bugged; it's not that you cannot get them though, it's that it's possible that they unlock at completely random times. For example, I randomly got six achievements at once at some point when I only should have gotten one.Even though I got quite mad at it at one point, I absolutely recommend the game because of its gorgeous art and story."

For the beginner is indeed hard enough, but all in all a recommended platformer. I felt some heavy art influences from Child of Light (having played it before Ori, I don't know which came first) and level design influences from that old game for Super Nintendo, Aladdin.Pros:+ Beautiful. Artwork , world design and soundtracks are really immersive.+ Interesting mechanics, nothing special but enough to pose a challenge and make your brain work.+ Hard enough to make you feel satisfied...Cons:- ... but also to make you swear many times. Many sections are unforgiving, prepare to die a lot (my first run shows 850+ death count).- Some areas cannot be completely explored unless you get there later, which is fine but if someone doesn't know it may be frustrating to find out that certain areas seem ""off limits"".- Commands are slightly messy - nothing game breaking, but sometimes your intention and the outcome are different.But I really enjoyed it, and with some patience everybody may get to the end and be satisfied (if I made it through...!)Recommended!"

The music is fantastic, perfectly reflecting each area and event, and never feels intrusive. It plays a lot like the old, 2D Metroid games, the platforming just difficult enough to offer a challenge, while not being impossible. The art style is BEAUTIFUL, colorful and easy to enjoy. I won't spoil any of the story, but I have never, in all my years of gaming, ever ONCE been so emotionally attached to any game or its characters. Ori himself is so adorable, I want a plushie of him!ANYway...This game is fantastic, and the only real complaint I may have is that you do have to go from place to place on your own.  There's no fast-transit mechanic, but even so, thanks to the art and sound track, backtracking doesn't feel as tedious. All in all, this game is a MUST PLAY! I serously recommend purchasing it.

Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the best platformers I have played in a long time.The graphics are magnificent. The artstyle is really shiny and looks great. There's a ton of visual effects and everything glows and shines. The game is extremely colourful and shows it often. Some people might be annoyed by this many colours and effects, but I enjoyed it.The gameplay is great. Normal platformer difficulty - a small challenge for casual players, a little easy for hardcore gamers. Hidden collectibles that upgrade you, XP from enemies, skill trees that allow you to fight enemies more, find collectibles with more ease or move around the map smoothly. A few puzzles here and there that are not very difficult, but fun.The story is a little short, but it's not really the focus of the game. Still, it's touching and has a satisfying, though cliche ending.Negative aspects:Three parts where you have to rush through a part of the map very quickly without being able to save at all. Incredibly   frustrating as it's simply repeating the same thing over and over and just memorizing the dangers (Similar to Little Horn from Super Meat Boy).Very few visual settings. Only the resolution is changeable with the bonus of being able to turn Motion Blur, VSync and Windowed Mode on and off. People with a bad PC cannot turn settings down to play this at a decent framerate.EDIT: Found out that (at least) one of the collectibles is not collectible if you miss it since the area changes permanently. That's quite annoying for people who love to 100% games, like me. Guess I'll have to replay this.Overall rating: 9/10"

Loved the appearance of everything and it felt familiar, but fresh.2. Platforming was not easy.  For being a charming game I found at times it to be devilishly hard.  Maybe I just stink, but there were certain parts of the game that I died A LOT before getting past them.  New elements were constantly added to keep it engaging and new.  Light RPG elements let you do some customization to your style of play.3.  The story/tale was refreshing.  With most games as beat'em senseless and we win the approach the story had in the game was great.  Just a nice change of pace and well done.4.  I liked just exploring past areas - not something I typically love doing in games, but it was fun to go back to old areas with new abilities and find the little treasures.Overall go play it.

The way the plot and emotional elements are woven seamlessly into a platformer is brilliant.  The only possibly negative thing I can say about it is that, because it's a challenging game, if you suck as badly as I did at it, you might end up getting frustrated at a few parts.  You will probably die a lot.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing but if the idea of trying a certain part like 100 times before you can do it doesn't appeal to you, it might not be your thing.

The graphics and sound combined with the sad story made this one of the best games I have probably ever played. The controls are straight forward and easy to learn but hard to master, and the game is pretty hard to play but very fun at the same time. They kept introducing new things that would add to what I could do and I always wanted to backtrack to see if i missed everything.

All the feels for every sad part in the game I found myself near tears more than once and not many games if any can do that to me. The touching story, the astounding music and the beauty of the world that is Ori just blows me away every time I go to a new area.I rage like a mofo when I'm running from my life more than once but that's just me personally. The relief I feel at the end of each run makes it sooo much worth the rage, blood, sweat and tears to get past those bits.Unfortunately I can only watch the cutscenes properly when the window is quite small but I think that's my laptop's problem. If people are having the same problems it could be because the computer or laptop just isn't able to handle the beauty that is Ori in the video parts.I wouldn't change anything in the game. I did find some bugs like places to die and getting stuck in areas where you really shouldn't but other than that I have mostly enjoyed this thouroughly.I look forward to seeing anything new that will be added or even a sequal if there is one as I haven't got to the end yet so I dunno if there is a window open for such a thing.Playing this truly amazing game I am just enjoying myself soo much right now.This is the first proper review I think I have written and I hope it reflects everything I'm telling you from the overwelming emotions that Ori has given me.Thanks guys, you really made this gamer very happy :)24/09/15Got to the End now 9/10 absolutely tip top game.

Ori and the Blind Forest is a platformer with some great level designs and some unique mechanics, it keeps a good level of balance with the difficulty throughout the game. None of the puzzles seemed too impossible to figure out and none were very straight forward, it does a bit of back tracking when you are moving from each area like in metroid since each level is connected on a giant map. There are many item's you can collect to use to upgrade yourself and discover more parts of the map like seceret doors, the ""villian"" in this game was great and for once actually had a reason to hate the light and Ori. Instead of it being so black and white like oh here's the evil guy who does nothing but evil and here's the good guy who is good in every sense of the word.

,Recommended,261570,17361897,"Posted: 2 August, 2015",all,RyanSD_91,"TL;DR:  Just buy the game. It's awesome.Ori and the Blind Forest is, in a word, captivating. It manages to capture airtight platforming, gorgeous vistas, clever level design, and a beautiful story in one inspiring package. The heartfelt tale of two inseperable companions torn apart by death could tug at the hearstrings of even the most stoic of us. Anyway, the forest becomes ""blind"" due to the death of a great tree, and it's up to Ori the tree spirit to return the forest to life.At it's best, Ori and the Blind Forest has you performing a nuanced aerial ballet, with each perfectly timed jump or bash propelling Ori to the next in a series of dazzling aerobatic maneuvers. The frequency of these blissful platforming sections is just one in a group of reasons why this game is great.Platforming wouldn't be nearly as fun if controlling Ori wasn't silky smooth like it is; That's just as well, because OatBF is challenging and demands a lot from the player. But, with the exception of some parts of the escape sequences, it's never cheap. Death is handled well, with each one immediately sending Ori back to the most recent checkpoint, and saving is easy: just hold down B and one orb of energy is consumed to save the game. These savepoints also allow access to Ori's ability trees. There are three in all: one for combat, one for exploration, and one for platforming/survivability. No one tree breaks the game.I'll briefly touch on the weaknesses of the game. There's a lack of enemy diversity, as you'll see the same frog-stompers and spike-slugs throughout all of the zones. Also, the same mini-boss encounter is used several times throughout the game as a block to the next area. Combat breaks up the jumping around nicely, but I feel like it's there just for the sake of it. I'm not saying it's not enjoyable, but platforming is way more fun here. Additionally, the ending dungeon sequence drags just a little bit.Finally, I'll give a quick shoutout to the soundtrack, and what a soundtrack it is. The musical themes range from touching to haunting to triumphant and the synergy between the storytelling and the music really packs an emotional punch. It works in harmony with the action on screen to a level I haven't seen in any game since Journey.Well there's nothing written here that couldn't be better expressed by the game. Stop reading and buy it so you can experience one of the absolute best games of 2015."

The promise of a great story goes unfulfilled, though, as the narrative becomes predictable and somewhat shallow by the end.  Staying strong throughout, however, are the sharp graphics and stirring soundtrack, which form a very impressive backdrop for the gameplay.While it took a few hours to warm up to the controls, I found the platforming design to be quite good; standing out in particular was “bash” - the ability to attach to enemies or projectiles, then catapult off of them in any direction I wanted. Unfortunately, the difficulty level is too high; numerous unfair deaths and seemingly endless retries were very off-putting. More shortcuts and a few warp points would have been nice as well, to make exploration a bit more flexible. Ori is at its best when it's most like Metroid: wandering around, searching for health and power expansions, and soaking in the sights and sounds.All told, Ori is a good game that I'm sure to return to some day, primarily to enjoy the amazing graphics. Just be sure to finish all of your exploration before entering the final dungeon: you can't go back, not even after the ending credits.(Rating: 7.5/10 “Good”)Note: I played with an Xbox 360 controller for Windows – recommended for platforming games."

Simple.There are those games that you play where you think, 'Yeah, these graphics are beautiful- really top notch!'... I'm not just talking about the graphics- though they are stunning, they do not solely contribute to making this the most beautiful game. The whole premise, the clear heartfelt love and dedication that Moon Studios put into this game, the storytelling.. the list goes on!This is a game where you will die. Oh you will die. And no that is not a threat from the game, it is almost a welcomed fact! The puzzles throughout are challenging enough that you will never really find yourself rage-quitting- helped by the instant revival back to your last save, with literally a 1 second loading time between death and revival. I died nearly 500 times... Yet I adore this game. Counts for something!If you are a fan of Metroid, or Rayman, or .. the list goes on- that side-scrolling category of games, or puzzle games in general, you will not want to miss out on this game. If you are a fan of beautiful artwork and stunning overall visuals, this is the game for you. Breathtaking accompanying music?? Check, it has it- get this game! If you want a game to crack that solid emotional exterior you have that you don't think can be cracked, well then look no further, as this game has the potential to have you crying at the screen screaming 'NOOOOO!! WHY WOULD YOU-- OHH!', then the next part you are smiling from ear to ear!It took me roughly fifteen hours to finish this game , and I'm usually one that is hesitant when spending even £10/£15 on a game that I know isn't going to last me the length of Skyrim, for example... But I took a punt with this game, knowing it wouldn't last me forever, but having now finished it, the length feels perfect. I feel like it deserves every last penny of the asking price (albeit I bought it on sale, shh!) and will not leave you dissapointed after.My only slight bother is that once you 'Complete' the game, i.e. the story, then that save slot (of which there are 3) is locked out as Completed, and you can't return to pick up and last collectibles to fulfill that 100% completionist mindset you may have. But I guess it encourages you to play it through again and collect them all as you go along and before you finish.Despite this, I would easily give this a 10/10 as it's a game that is simply perfect on all levels and one that you should definitely add to your ever-growing Steam library! =)"

When all hope is lost in the wake of a wrathful owl, you are ignited with renewed furvor, given the task to bring the forest back to harmoy.The look of the game is wonderful, I praise all the hard work these artist put into it, and the music. I find the story to be short and thin, but it never overstayed it's welcome despite it.Where I feel it lacks in polish, and when, is around and after the 2nd dungeon and into the late game. You can easily explore and obtain what this place has to give you if you're peristant in doing so, leaving little after when you make the march for the final dungeon. I virtually had everything picked clean and had all the skills at the ready for when I entered inside.When reaching the goal then, you are given the final escape, which I found to be rough on the edges. The instant death marks that you have to avoid are a little mired in the haste and confusion that the game sets for you in that moment, leaving me befuddled during the final stretch when I forgot a certain mechanic the game notifies you upon in the previous area, when you had to obtain the 3rd dungeon's enterance key.Once beating the game, I'm left with the question of whether or not I was satisfied. My time with it was spent in a sort of up and down rollercoaster with my own life and physical health. I feel like Ori himself, as a character, hadn't had much chance to really develop, or express that development through his travel through the forest. I'm left to wonder, if at all, that it could've been enhanced by a mechanic where you find pieces of story you could sit down and read, about the world, the races within, the tree itself, whether it's in a text or possibly slide show esque sort. I would've enjoyed on top of the fact if I could enter in my save game, and just roam around the world when it's all healed, have like no monsters to bother me with and just let the platforming side of things take me wherever.With all that said, I'm happy I bought the game. I enjoyed myself for the experience the game had to offer. I can wish for this and that all I please, but the game is nice for what it is."

The music is a master level piece and touches your heart all the time. The art is amazing and different all the time. Smooth animations and good platforming. However the game can be reptitive and frustrating depends on your personal play style. The game is worth buying, best when it is about 10-25 usd but even it is 50+ usd it is still worth it if you got the money.Review:This game is amazing, after beating the whole games, I cried at least 5 times. Put you in game, the first 5 minute already threw the tear gas at you. The game is a decent puzzle game with a really smooth animations. Arts in the games is amazing, the music is top class.The story is about Ori, the little light cutie who got adopted by Naru, which is the purple creature. One day the forest orb got stolen by the huge bird, everything in the forest starting to be destroyed and infected. Invade by all the evil creatures. The whole forest became a mess and you Ori need to save the forest. I am not going to tell you what's happened before that or after that. The characters in the game all have their own story that makes you cry and reflect about.The game is definitely challenging , I died countless of time and perhaps a bit angry sometimes. However, the story after is worth it. Your skills will level up through time and you can unlock news skills from exploring places. There's secondary level up but it is not a ""Must"" to have them, but they sure will make the game easier for you. After spending 7 hours in game, with a play style like speed running just for the story, there's a tons of areas that I haven't explore yet, the game can last longer than 8 hours in my opinion.The games does have some cons, because there's no teleport or fast travel, once you arrive the location, it would tell you to go somewhere else further. From your starting locations on the left side through the right side, then at last it will tell you to go back near the beginning. Therefore, it will get kinda boring. Personally think that the game's simple story line and music overpowered and left the game behind. Sometimes, I just dont really care about the gameplay and just want to know what's going to happen. Therefore, you will miss alot of things when you trying to avoid enemies and get to the location as soon as possible. It is a place to place pattern, no side quest and only got one straight storyline, so sometimes you might just ignore the locked areas and just wanted to proceed your journey.I will suggest this game to people who likes to play puzzle games or platformers, the gameplay is challenging and smooth, if you like the feeling of being chased or escaping, this is probably the platformer you are looking for. But you will still need to die a few times to understand the map and how it works, later on the skills will increase, you will forgot about the bottons and things just get a bit complicated, but you will work it out anyway since the game will always give you some puzzles for you to refresh your memory. I would'nt suggest this game to people who don't like stories telling, ""People who never cried because a movie"" or ""I am a smart person, intellgent over feelings"" because this game's stories is what makes you motivative, it is like a rollercoaster and playing around with your feelings. If you don't like the touching theme, you won't like to proceed the game since we play the game to feel."

I was not disappointed when this game made me cry in the first 10 minutes asI watched Ori's adopted mother die in front of him.The events afterwards only further glued me to my screen.This game's visuals are breath-taking and the soundtrack even more so. Gameplay is solid.Ori and the Blind Forest is a tough, but fair and lovable game.I've only played 3 hours and I know this is gonna be a longand frustratingand fun game.Not to mention that the definitive edition will be coming out soon with even more content that was produced with as much love and care as the base game was made with.Much kudos to Moon Studios for their talent and Microsoft Studios for seeing said talent.This game is definitely a 10/10 and should be Game of the Year."

76561198037372051,Recommended,261570,15211560,"Posted: 4 April, 2015",all,Wondercrab,"After just having beaten this game, I need to have a long hard think about whether it's my favourite thing I've ever played in twenty years of gaming. Right now, I'm leaning towards yes.Every now and again you get a game that just nails everything spot on. The visuals are the best I have ever seen in any video game, period. Ori is a testament to how beautiful art design will always trump polygon counts and graphical fidelity, and its visuals are likely to age better than perhaps any other video game made to date. I expect it will be a long, long time before anything else comes along that can trump the sheer beauty of Ori.The gameplay is some of the best I have ever experienced. Tight controls, a complex variety of skills to use, and absolutely phenomenal level design that ensures it makes full use of the increasingly numerous abilities the player has right up until the end. Nothing ever felt like a gimmick, and playing this game was such a joy that I would gladly bounce around the world of Nibel for hours just to enjoy the way Ori runs, jumps, dives, glides, and swims.And the music? It's the emotional core that holds it all together. The enchanting soundtrack will have most players crying at the beginning, crying at the end, squeeing in excitement during the dramatic sequences, and wide-eyed in wonder at the haunting scenes they traverse over the course of their adventures.Is Ori a perfect game? Very nearly. There is, unfortunately, only one slight ding on its perfection.By and large the game allows you to set your own difficulty in an incredibly intuitive, organic fashion, by allowing the player to create save points at almost any time (at the cost of a cooldown, and diminishing some of Ori's magical power). Despite having some incredibly challenging segments, even relatively inexperienced platformer players should be able to beat most of the game without too much difficulty, due to the frequent ability to save.I say *most* of the game, because Ori breaks this perfect system at three critical points during the experience. There are no bosses, but rather three lengthy escape sequences that involve lots of instant death mechanics, a race against the clock, and by far the most difficult challenges contained within the game. These sequences have no checkpoints, and you cannot save during them.As someone who's been playing platformers all my life, the only sequence that gave me much trouble was the final one, but I've heard tales of many players getting stuck and giving up as early as the first, and I empathise with them completely. The game allows anyone to complete 90% of its content -- and I'm sure many people would be drawn to this one for the art, music, and story alone -- yet forces them into bottlenecks that seem hell-bent on making less experienced players get frustrated and quit. It's fine for a game to be as challenging as Ori is during the escape segments, but it's a huge misstep to coax the average joe or jane in with such a forgiving save system, only to hit them with three increasingly difficult brick walls after a couple of hours.However, this is the only part of the experience that mars perfection, and for more hardcore players it's not much of an issue. I hope the devs patch in optional checkpoints for these sequences, because I feel like a lot of players might currently be missing out on most of what Ori has to offer due to the difficulty roadblocks.Overall, though? Amazing, incredible, sublime game. A true work of art if ever there was one. Due to the issue mentioned above, it falls just shy of perfection, but as someone who wasn't too punished by the escape sequences, I know I'll certainly go away from Ori with a little more light in my heart. <3"

Despite my indifference to the genre, I absolutely loved Ori and the Blind Forest. The graphics/art style and the amazing soundtrack (probably the best of any game out this year) drew me in from the beginning. The storyline is simple yet emotional and heartwarming. The gameplay however can be quite challenging at times-- there are lengthy sequences without checkpoints, and you have to pull off literally dozens of perfectly timed moves one after another in order to make it out alive. That was my only (minor) complaint about a game that is otherwise flawless. This is an indie game that feels more polished than most AAA titles, and in my opinion, it deserves at least a nomination for GOTY awards. WELL DONE, MOON STUDIOS !!!"

It is also one of the finest examples of proving astistic expression in a way only a video game can do.First impressions where good by all means. Cute character, lovely soundtrack and absolutely astounding visuals that still leaved me in awe. Ori and The Blind Forest tells it's story in a very interesting and beautiful way.Final impression wise it is almost the opposite of my experience with Hatred, which I really tried to like but could not.Ori I approached with neutral feelings with a minor weariness and now find myself liking it more than I feel I should, but there is just no denying this is a great game.  As a rabid fan of metroidvania games its also nice to have one where I can move around and contiune the story without running back and fourth in circles figuring out what I am even supposed to do and Ori does that quite well.If I have two negatives the first will be the one I hinted prior, the biggest flaw of the game is that once the game is done so if your save file. Its still there to let you know you completed the game and that is about all it is for as far as I can see. This is because I can't seem to access it anymore. So be weary of that one issue. Though it may be with how the ending was handled. I won't spoil it but some may find it disappointing but I am fine with it for its uniqueness.That brings us to one other thing about it. As the game progresses onware it becomes very, VERY unforgiving.              So the game certainly is anything but toothless while also not being very painful earing it that balanced phrase ""hard but fair"". The escape sequences are the most thrilling aspect of the game and also the most headache rage inducing part that some may not be able to handle. Certainly moving it far away from the casual spectrum while also not being that hard.I recommend Ori and the Blind Forest for its beauty, story telling, and fresh new take on one of my favorite genres ."

(if you want to hear nice things only, skip the rest)That is Ori, but there are some flaws, not in the game itself, no, but in the port. The keys are not rebindable, which is frustrating. Especially with left shift, this key needs to be somewhere else. Also, sometimes the game lets you use mouse for aiming, sometimes it does not. And I must not forget - this game tends to loose its protagonist in flashy white explosions, which results in death, this could be easily avoided if you just layer your assets differently.Someone will say that I am nitpicking, but rebindable keys and full mouse support is something every PC game needs. If you dont know what I mean, look at Dust: an Elysian tale - that game is a proper port, this is ridiculous.<tl;dr> Good game with occasional console peasantry showing in it.

You will die often and you should take your time getting through these hurdles.The game is appropriately challenging in a very integrated way, adding to the tension at some points of the story. There is a lot of intentional backpedaling through the world, and you'll do it often on accident, but that's part of the game's intent to make the player solve puzzles. You will sigh, whine, and huff repeatedly in some areas. This game is all about muscle memory and being able to scale through the world efficiently and effectively.For anyone that's an amateur or a veteran of platformers, I highly recommend and urge anyone remotely interested in Ori and the Blind Forest to buy it."

Every single background is mind-blowing, the gameplay is very responsive and enjoyable, the storyline focuses on very deep and meaningful themes (mostly life, death, and sacrifice), and the soundtrack is breathtaking. It feels like Metroid about how the entire map is designed (you go back and forth, finally reaching bonuses thanks to the latest upgrade you unlocked), and there is definitely something of Rayman Origins/Legends in how this game is played. Your character levels up and gains new abilities throughout the entire game. Choices don't seem to matter that much at first but it's because you actually improve your skills while progressing into the game, without even noticing. I'm stating the obvious here, but a gamepad is mandatory. I had a few bugs with my Xbox One gamepad though (3 freezes during the game, probably because I pressed too many buttons, and a recurring issue while trying to load my game).The game is not perfect but it's as close as it can get in my opinion. Yes it's a bit short (10 hours on my part and I almost reached 100% on the first run), yes some people will find the game too easy (the last part of each dungeon can be quite tricky though, casual players may have a hard time on these). The only things I didn't like in this game is it's impossible to come back in certain areas (dungeons usually lock once you've been there), and the fact that the game has no replay value. Yet, nothing game-breaking. The game is still VERY enjoyable (truth be told, I cried 3 times!). It's an amazing game and it's totally worth its full price.

Ori is sad because Puffy dies of starvation.  Ori puts the world back together.  Owl is rightfully annoyed by this because it's scared of murdertoxin lights.  Ori lights the world on fire.  Owl fixes big tree instead of letting it's final egg get broiled.  Big tree does owl the final favor of vaporizing it.

,Recommended,261570,15858177,"Posted: 16 May, 2015",all,Wolf Rawrrr,"(for a brief pros/cons list, scroll down - this review is completely spoiler-free)Ori and the Blind Forest is the best action platformer I have ever played, as well as one of the best games ever made. The world of the forest of Nibel is portrayed extremely well; the environment is simply beautiful and very detailed. The soundtracks are amazingly well done and complement the game perfectly. Each of the playable regions has a unique feel to it and never gets boring, not even when you keep dying and are forced to see the same part again and again for a while. The game is actually very well balanced and you will probably be slowed down more by the tricky terrain rather than the enemies. There is a good number of challenging situations that bring a sense of accomplishment when you finally overcome them. The game lets you spend energy points (which are very common) to create save points virtually anywhere you want, a system that feels incredibly right and useful in this game. There are of course several regular save locations as well as auto-saves after important events.The story itself is told mostly through exploration and cutscenes with little dialogue, but having completed the game I can't say I ever felt the need for more words. It is a very emotional, dramatic story that quickly unfolds before you and sneaks tears into your eyes before you know it. The ending is fitting and satisfying. The only thing that I miss is no New Game+ or at least a way to revisit every area to collect things you might have missed before finishing the game. Sadly there are a couple areas that are blocked after being beaten and you can never return there so it keeps you from achieving 100% clear game if you missed anything. At least this was so at the time this review was written. If they fix it meanwhile, then this game has become flawless :)It took me 8 hours to beat the game and that was with 98% completion (due to the couple areas I couldn't re-enter). I would say there is replay value here despite the story and exploration being quite linear, simply because it is such a fun, exciting, beautiful and rewarding game. I know I will definitely keep coming back to it. It is absolutely worth the full price of 20 EUR I paid for it.Pros+ Beautiful, detailed graphics+ Amazing soundtracks+ Fun and exciting gameplay+ Highly emotional and dramatic story+ A good balance of difficulty with some challenging but rewarding parts+ Still enjoying the game after 20+ hours+ Replayability despite being linear, due to all the other prosCons- No New Game+ or way to continue playing after beating the game- Some areas are blocked after clearing and cannot be revisited to collect missed items/discovery- Some achievements might not be properly recognized at timesFINAL VERDICT: 9/10"

The story of ori alone is just a same like me. I am alone with no friends and thinking to my mother everyday. It touch my heart so much until my memories came when i was a child surviving the life in order to grow up which i felt nothing and dont know about the world.... but my mom teach me a lot how to survive and living in this world we have to be brave when no one be there at your side especially if your love ones(mom,dad or girlfriends) died and keep in your memory that cant be real.I am recommended to all on this game that remind me to not forget where we belong and where our history made. This game makes you to remind what was left behind in the past that was painful.... but u need to survive and live. What not make you die makes you more stronger and intelligent because we learn from the forest and nature. Death is a promising a guarentee to all that called themself a human.When i was wrote this review, i cried. Crying because of all the memories in my head that u regret it or u missed it. Memories is painful than a eyes of sword. This game teach me a lot and keep remind me where the path i was forgotten in times.Graphic is the best. This game is half story half game. Great soundtrack than when you heard it combined with the story of ori makes you feeling the soul of this game.I rate 5/5 stars or 10/10 stars because i understand the developer tried so hard to get the best of it and they earn the best from me.Hardness i will give 5/5 stars. This game is hard eventhough u just playing only W A S D and SPACE key. It is all about timing. Timing and timing and timing. If u wrong your calculation and timing, then you will die and continue with the same scene over and over again. Trust me i have tried almost 300 times trial to pass just only one scene of this game.Tension and stress to play this game is 5/5stars or 10/10stars. Why i decide to put this rate? Buy first then you shall know. I am not recommended if you guys to play this game whom have a high level of temper and unpatient disorder. Difficulties level is very high. I am sure people like kind of this one will smack the keyboard out to the wall. Trust me i already played.

Through out the game, as Ori, you need to navigate the platforms and solve multiple challenging puzzles. Using Soul Link, the player can save the game and use experience to achieve new perks or upgrade current perks.I have never been a fan of platforming games!Despite that fact this game fits my lore/ story driven loving mind. Within the first 7 minutes I had been through a rollarcoaster of emotions.The voice of the Spirit Tree in the forest of Nibel narrates that when Ori fell from the tree during a storm, Ori became orphaned and was then adopted by Naru, who raises Ori as her own. The love between Naru and Ori is shown by Narus affection.Suddenly a cataclysmic event damages or ""kills"" the forest causing its food supply to wither. Here an act of affection performed by both Naru and Ori shows the affection between them.Spoiler aheadAfter Narus death, Ori becomes orphaned yet again and is forced to make due by itself.Ori collapses near the Spirit Tree reviving it (sort of) and then becomes revived by the Spirit Tree, Ori later meets Sein, a being who guides and helps Ori against enemies through out the game. Sein is a part of the power of the Spirit Tree, as Sein explains itselfI was lost in this glen when she loosened her grip.Sein is referring to Kuro, a giant raven-shaped bird whom stole the core of the Spirit Tree. When Ori was lost, the Spirit Tree released a flash of light to look for Ori;When I lit the skies ablaze, I called out to OriThe flash released by the Spirit Tree killed three of Kuro's hatchlings leaving Kuro vengeful. Kuro despises the light. Though depicted mostly as vengeful, hostile and cruel - Kuro has a fierce passion to protect her last unborn child.Together Ori and Sein strive to recover the light of the three main elements which supports the balance of Nibel; Waters, winds and warmth.Through out the game Ori and Sein comes across other characters, which I will not yet reveal here until I, myself, have completed the game 100%I recommend this game because it has amazing, stunning and breathtaking scenery, animations and stages. Really the art of the game is beautiful.The plot itself is amazing and when you're introduced to all characters, the game leaves you, yet again, stunned and speechless. Not to mention the soundtrack which functions exactly as any soundtrack should. It helps breathe life into the players immersion and emotion.And when you have completed the game, you will speculate - does the game have an actual message? It probably has - and I will find it."

And with ""Ori and the Blind Forest,"" I would feel ashamed to not give this game my support.Out of the many games I have played throughout my life, this game is, by far, one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. And I am not just talking about visually. It is pure gold not only due to its superior visuals, vibrant colors, and breath-taking graphics, but due to its sound as well. I'm not even talking about JUST the music. Even the SOUND EFFECTS are golden. Like the little noises Ori makes when you receive damage, use special skills, etc. The integration of music is astounding too. For example, when traversing throughout the world, the music that plays in accordance to your location and the progression you've made in the story flows and transitions fluently and smoothly, granting you a much more immersive experience.I don't just like this game solely because of it's beauty, though. In addition to my concurrence with individuals who state this is a form of art within a video game, I would also like to inform you that this game consists of even more value than that. In addition to the colors that gracefully lather themselves onto your screen, and the melodic harmonies that caress your ears, this game is fun as hell, too. The gameplay you will experience is smooth, satisfying, and keeps you from wanting to take a break for very long periods of time.Lastly, and one of my favorite things about ""Ori and the Blind Forest,"" is that the game is definitely reminiscent of Metroid, as well as The Legend of Zelda. As I was unlocking new skills throughout the game, I couldn't help but notice the experience I was having to be resemblant of ""Metroid Fusion"" for the GameBoy Advance system, which I absolutely loved playing. And the little fairy-like creature that follows you around everywhere and offers you advice/guidance while playing this game reminds me of Navi, from ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time."" These aspects found within ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" only strengthened and intensified the positive experience I had while playing this beautiful game.This game is an extremely hard-to-find masterpiece of a platform game, and it should be played by anyone and everyone it appeals to.TL;DR-One of the best platform games I have ever been lucky enough to come across and get my hands on-BEAUTIFUL graphics-BEAUTIFUL music & sound effects-Extremely immersive as well as emotional story-Entertaining, satisfying, and all-around fun gameplay-Rekindles nostalgic experiences found within previous titles such as ""Metroid"" and ""The Legend of Zelda""-Essentially the best $20 dollars I have ever spentPurchase this game and play it, because if you haven't, then you're missing out."

Death is pretty generous--you can put checkpoints almost anywhere you want, fueled by the same stuff as your heavy attacks, so the frustration level is low.  It has an experience system, but it's really just used for optional upgrades instead of more hp; I haven't felt a need to grind for xp yet.  Also did I mention it's really pretty?  Watch the trailer.Big downside for me:  This thing chews up over 2GB of ram.  My old laptop only has 4, and in some areas (like borders between areas, or one place where you need to move really quickly) it likes to freeze up, sometimes for seconds at a time.  Not cool, game.  It's still super playable 95% of the time though, and if your machine isn't from 2009 you probably won't have that problem.Review after beating the game:  I wouldn't consider this a classic, but it had a satisfying ending.  It feels like the middle of the game is a bit sparse on the storytelling, but it all works out.  Six hours to beat the game the first time, probably four hours to 100% it the second time...

From the very moment the game starts its hard not to appreciate just how beautiful the game is. But don't let that beauty and artistry fool you. Beneath the vivid color pallete and wonderful animation lies a incredibly challenging 2-D platformer.Ori is proof that you don't need a complex story to have a good story. Its story is simple but evocative. Within the first ten minutes of the game you will find your heartstrings being pulled. It also needs to be said that Ori's soundtrack and audio are superb. From the opening score the music helps to draw you into the world.Its quite clear to me that the game drew inspiration from classic NES platformers like Metroid and Kid Icarus. But Ori finds clever new ways to use similar ideas to make it feel like a wholy unique experience. For example in Metroid you often download a map for the area using a map station; or come to areas you can't access yet. This idea is present in Ori as well but you can only do so after you obtain map fragments. This encourages exploration. And like Metroid you will find areas that are only accessible after you acquire a new ability. In one sequence there are these glowing tubes that propel you off screen only to show up on the opposite side of the screen. This is a mechanic that appeared in Kid Icarus. There are also tubes on the top and bottom of the screen. These 'tubes' have force and can send you to your death if you aren't careful.Ori has a surprising level of character progression. You can pick up spheres to gain ability points, or increase your health/magic. These act like Energy tanks or missile expansions in Metroid. The game has save points but you are able to use a bit of your 'magic' (blue energy) to create a save point of your own. This also serves to assign ability points to upgrade your abilities. These abilites can range from increased damage, or automatic pickup of health/magic etc.Ori is a truly gorgeous game that while perhaps inspired by classic NES platformers; it manages to stand on its own. Like its predecessor's the game isn't afraid to challenge you. And when you complete a difficult section its all the more satisfying. This game is worth every penny; and should not be missed. If you enjoyed games like Super Metroid your going to love Ori."

The visuals are very artistic, and the gameplay is excellent and fluid.It follows the standard formula of such a game whereas during progression and exploration, you gain new abilities, and become stronger.  What shines for me in this game is the save feature and the Bash ability, which lends itself favor to a lot of technical players and speedrunners.  The save feature is used through the game's Soul Link (or Magic) meter.  You use an orb (or half of it) to create a Soul Tree, where you can level up abilities and Save, practically anywhere, of course if you have any meter.The combat, though basic, it works.  You have an orb that follows you around, and it fires at enemies.  Of course you can use the Stomp attack (which is gained later in the game) to dispose of your foes.  Also with the Bash ability you can knock projectiles into other enemies, or knock enemies off into lava and so forth.The plot is touching, to say the least.  I really grew attached to the few characters in the game, and there is a minor twist that is somewhat foreseeable, as to the motive of the ""villain"" in the game.  Some may give a resounding groan or ""meh"" in terms of the story delivery, but it definitely serves its purpose.Any Metroidvania fan should play this game."

(and yes, funner is a word) The worst thing about the game though, is that you should expect to die. A lot. The game itself is moderately difficult, so don't expect to get through it in a couple of lives.

Several of its components were flawless, from sound design and soundtrack to visuals and platforming/combat. The only major drawbacks were the sometimes permanent forks in the road coupled with forced autosaves, and an inability to backtrack to some areas for completion. Completed saves can not be re-entered and cleaned up which I found a nuisance, but some would argue incentivizes players to replay the otherwise fairly short (10 hour) game.- If I had to assign a quick number, I'd give it a solid 9/10 for remarkable, memorable, and genuinely moving combinations of sound and visual design, drawn back only slightly by a few poor choices in level design and gameplay elements.- Finally, I found the Ginso Tree to be disproportionately more difficult than any other segment of the game, finale included.

I'm not one who normally shouts out loud when playing a game, but there were a good number of times I couldn't help but yell, ""I regret nothing!!!"" as I jumped off a ledge into the unknown.

,Recommended,261570,14997568,"Posted: 21 March, 2015",all,[MoS] Naelok,"So this is a nice, short Metroidvania style game with a remarkable art style and a superb soundtrack. It's got some decently challenging platforming in it and some fantastic level design.I've seen some people describe the game as 'hard'. It isn't. One of Ori's core features is the ability to create save points at any safe location, which essentially means that the game pretty much expects you to essentially go through its challenging platform sections with a bit of trial and error. You'll jump off a platform and get shot by one of the forests many death lasers, which kills you instantly. But that's okay! Respawn is completely instantaneous and doesn't break the game's flow, so you can live and adapt.Mind you: A bit of quick thinking and twitch reflexes can get you through things in the first go for most of the game. However, in the 'escape' sections you can expect to have to go through them 6-10 times before you get it right. And that's okay! Learning patterns and executing interesting escapes is really quite fun. Especially since Ori gives you such a variety of different platforming tools to deal with any given problem.Though honestly: The fact that the game is challenging makes me like it all the more. Games have gotten too accessible lately. I like the image of some hippy getting the game based on the art style, expecting some postmodern tale about the folly of man, and then getting spikes shoved up his butt. GIT GOOD SON.Speaking of the story, it's actually pretty good, but ultimately a bit too happy go lucky for my tastes. Anyone that tells you that they cried at the beginning is probably the same kind of person that cries during Disney movies. Mommy dies, ♥♥♥♥, no one cares. Get a ♥♥♥♥ing hold of yourself, you're a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.But in any case:It's smooth, it's satisfying and it's beautiful. It's over in about 8-9 hours, but you'll spend those hours in a bit of platforming bliss as you admire the jaw droppingly beautiful art style.Get it. You'll enjoy it."
,Recommended,261570,15317119,"Posted: 11 April, 2015",all,I'm Not Sue,"Ori and the Blind forest is a metroidvania-esq game with a greater focus on platforming than on the other aspects of games in that genre, and a gorgeous aesthetic that really sets it apart.The game has excellent performance but there are a few technical issues with the game.  The game doesn't bind the mouse to the game window when in fullscreen, so if you have multiple monitors you can mouse outside the screen.  There are only a few graphics options but that sort of comes with the whole package as a 2D title like this.  You can't take away much because all the assets are more or less a core part of the game.  Controller and keyboard + mouse mappings are not rebindable so if you do not like the control scheme you may find yourself at a bit of a loss, I personally did not find it to be to bothersome despite some accidental inputs on my part.  The default controls for Windows may cause you to trigger the Sticky Keys by pressing Shift too many times so save yourself a little trouble and turn that off before you play.  Lastly, the game does not alt-tab as you'd expect and will force itself into windowed mode instead, but pressing the old alt+enter shortcut to put the game puts it back in place without much trouble.The presentation and aesthetic of this game are amazing.  An artist's touch definately went into the making of this game, which says a lot I think because many modern games have difficulty achieving this with 3D graphics due to the way those games render.  This game presents some amazingly lovely scenes with great color and detail, much like a wonderful work of fantasy art.  A lot of little touches go into the game's other parts too, with good sound design (Ori's gasp for air when surfacing water especially stands out in my mind) and a lovely soundtrack I can't wait to buy.  Its not quite on the level of Transistor or Bastion where the soundtracks play a more integral part of the game, but this game's score does not dissapoint and adds so much to the game.  The story of the game is far from original, but it is well-presented and meshes with the gameplay that I don't feel like that harms it at all.  My only critique here would have been that a little longer of an intro-prologue might've let me feel more attached to the characters before the game unfolds, but I think they made the right choice here in not delaying the player from the core of the game too long.  I have always had the opinion that you don't need an original story or unique gameplay to make a good video game, it just has to be robust and people will enjoy it.Gamplay is where I think I want to get into the nitty-gritty.  This game has been described as a metroidvania, which is in some way right and in some ways wrong.  This game doesn't have a lot of the mainstays of that genre.  There are no boss battles, enemies aren't particularly varied and are kind of forgettable with a few exceptions.  There is no uniqueness of collectables to backtrack for like in the castlevania titles, only health and energy upgrades and skill points.  The game gives you major mobility changes at quite a few points like in game.  Instead of gear, the game has a skill point system which functions more like ease-of-life progression (adding map markers for undiscovered powerups), and isn't required to finish the game but still presents enough to be meaningful (like adding a triple-jump).  As an additional note, you can save almost anywhere, and save points are also a health restore mechanic in this game and relevant in my next point.What the game opts for instead of enemies is platforming.  Metroidvania title's aren't particularly known for their platforming, but instead for their gating.  You only need double jumps and wall smashing to get past certain barriers, but they aren't particularly core parts of the game in Castlevania.  In Ori that IS a huge chunk of the gameplay.  Gliding and jumping around rooms filled with spikes, bouncing off enemy bullets to climb chasms, and other activities are the challenge the game will present.  Sometimes this will be calm and sometimes it will be hectic.  The real boss battles of this game are dramatic sequences where you will either need to jump and bounce and dodge away from perils whilst certain death chases behind, or carefully platform in pseudo-stealth sections between safe spots.  In both cases, these need to be performed flawlessly as you cannot save midway through.  This is where some people may find the game a bit too frustrating from repeated failures as there is no way to tone down the difficulty of these sections.  I personally did not find them difficult enough to be problematic, and when fully completed I really appreciated the thrill and excitement that the scene was trying to convey.All in all, Ori and the Blind Forest is a game that I have confidently placed among my favorite games.  The metroidvania genre is one I quite enjoy and this is an excellent title in that genre with its own beautiful aesthetic and platforming twist.   The game clocked in about 9 hours of gameplay for me with almost total completion, however the game does not permit you to revisit a few areas of the game nor leave the final dungeon, nor can a clear save file be reloaded and there is no NG+, so completionists may find themselves necessitating a second playthough.  There is not a particularly high replay value unless you simply want to enjoy the game again, but as a game that is likely to become a classic I think it will be a title you will happily come back to a year or two down the line.  Even at the full price of $20 I would absolutely recommend this game.Lastly, thank you to the friend who gifted me this game.  I absolutely loved it.EDIT : A recent patch fixed the fullscreen resolution bugs among others, and added some save backup options."

The gamplay itself is also something the developers should be proud of.  It is an open world platformer where you actually have to travel accross the discovered map to find your next destination.  The skills you gain as the stroy progresses are each usefull and none of them are forgotten.  The game even tests you with the skills.  There is also no shortage of challenges.  You need to learn and adapt to the area you are in to progress.

,Recommended,261570,15442628,"Posted: 18 April, 2015",all,AppelJoosh,"Oh boy, where to start...If you want a short version of this review I'll just say this; 11/10 Would 100% complete again.Now here's the long version.Ori and the Blind Forest is a platformer which has a slight tendency to incorporate puzzles, requiring you to put your skills to the test and combine all of your unlocked abilities to get every single collectable. These puzzles aren't neccessarily hard, but you're certainly going to have to remember every single one of your abilities to 100% this game.The music is just brilliant, I've never desperately wanted to buy a game JUST for it's soundtrack. The music in the trailer is just fantastic, and as soon as you hear it, you'll be cracking into a smile in no time. The transitions between music is also really smooth, as all the music seems to run at a similar tempo (except for a select few tracks) so the transitions seem to be just substituting some instruments with other instruments, instead of loading screens with the track changing as the game loads.The graphics are just as beautiful, with almost everything interacting with Ori when you run by them. I once jumped by some vines, only to see them sway with Ori as I flew through the air. Everything is very detailed, as you can see little bats hanging on the ceiling in caves, water flowing in the background, individual rocks, and even a strange creature appearing in the foreground. Any hazard is very well detailed, and you'll really only run into them if you're simply not paying attention.The gameplay is also really good. While this game seems to be one of those games that you should only play with a controller, the keyboard and mouse work just as good, if not better! This is a game I certainly recommend picking up some time. I don't care when you buy it, what system you buy it on, just buy it at some point in your life span.Oh, one thing I should mention. If you plan on getting this game, but just so happen to have a not-so-powerful PC, or don't have an XBOX One on hand, this game will definitely slow down for you. My PC is a pretty low-end one, so the game's video runs slower to keep a consistent framerate. (I actually really like that idea) This becomes ESPECIALLY apparent in the cutscenes, as the music will play faster than the video itself. There are some sweet spots that will run smoothly for you, and some areas that'll make your FPS drop from 30-40 to 10-20 just by walking into the area. Basically, if you have a low-end computer, and no XBOX, but still want to play this game, the game'll run for you, but it won't run at a fast speed, so make sure that other graphic-heavy games such as Skyrim run at about 60 FPS without breaking a sweat. As a general guideline for whether the game runs well for you, if the game is running over 45 FPS, you're pretty much set. (Steam has an in-game FPS counter if you want to use that) Apart from that tiny setback, the game is definitely worth the purchase. I hope Moon Studios produces more content that are equal to, or are better, than Ori and the Blind Forest.Edit: After actually playing the game on the 360 myself, low-end PCs and the 360 both have slow down."

,Recommended,261570,17811680,"Posted: 31 August, 2015",all,Roel,"Ori and the Blind Forest, aka 10h of your life you will never forget.There is little wrong that you can say about the game. It grabs your attention with beatiful and captivating music and visuals, introducing a bitter-sweet tale of a light-creature named Ori. Once there, you will find yourself presented with quite the beatiful little world to explore, populated by deadly creatures and with many secrets to uncover.Make no mistakes, the forest of Nibel is as pretty as it is deadly, and the challenges thrown at you will make you die. A lot. Be it a new enemy, new skill or just a ""simple"" platforming sequence requiring great precision, there is no clowning around. Not even with full health and defensive upgrades can you laugh in the face of your adversaries, especially when they stop being a thing to kill and become just another piece in platforming dance with the death, all of it the courtesy of Dash ability.That one gets a special shout-out for being absolutely ingenious, adding a lot of new possibilities in all areas. Exploring, combat and platforming becomes much more when you acquire it, and proper use can turn damningly hard sequences into a breeze.With everything flowing perfectly, always feeling like a well-thought package and keeping just the right pace of introducing new elements, enemies and challenges, is there really anything negative to say about Ori? Actually, there is.There are special areas in the game that won't be accessible after completing them, and the save gets locked once you finish the game. What it basically means is that if you slip up in exploring or completing the game, there is nothing you can do aside from starting a new save slot. It is not a terrible flaw, but stands as one thing that could've been done better, especially since you can' have more than one save of the given playthrough.That is only a mild annoyance, however.Play it once, and you won't be able to be mad at the game for trying to make you dive in once again."

It cannot be overstated how great the presentation in Ori and the Blind Forest is. The platforming is tight and fun and the world is worth exploring. Not much to say other than this is a wonderful gem of a game in every way.
,Recommended,261570,21879745,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,Darmok <Popular Geekery>,"Ori and the Blind Forest was suggested to me because of my love of ""Metroidvania"" games. I put off buying it because, you know... poor. But when I finally got it, It was completely worth it.The game is simple at its core: a forest spirit, Ori, is searching for a being that took care of it and was basically a parent to them - and that's pretty much all I can say about the plot. It throws you in immediately and sets the tone for the rest of the story.The game is absolutely stunning, and at times I lost lives because I was distracted by the amazing backgrounds or boss designs.As I said before, this is a metroidvania and I LOVE a good exploration, get xp, get powerups, MORE exploration type game. The powers, skills, and abilities you find throughout your journey through the forest are fun and useful. There are some times when I didn't know how to defeat a certain enemy, but for the most part the level design is well done. You get an ability and the game gives you a gradually increasing difficulty using them. I used a controller while playing, so I cannot speak to the keyboard setup.It was wonderful to play this, and just writing about it makes me want to play it again. A note to anyone who is looking for a fun/silly exploration game... this story can get pretty real. I suggest HELL YEAH! for something like that, which hopefully will be my next review.On a personal note, I sometimes suffer from bouts of depression. The weekend I bought this was one of those times - there were things going on in the midwest that really got to me, and I was thinking I would just get some game on my wishlist to distract me. Playing this, going through such an emotional story with moments of pure catharsis got me through that dark time.That may not be the case for you, everyone is different. But I would tell anyone to try playing through this game when your soul just feels run down. I think it would help."

I could play it on 4k at ~65fps with a midrange GPU. At it's core Ori and the Blind Forest is a platformer with small puzzles connected to the map. Most of the time the game is fun and fluid. Some parts of the game are sort of unintuitive however and this game has a low replayability in my opinion. There's elements that are supposed to encourage you to keep playing such as abilities, health/energy/ability orbs which you can pick up throughout the game etc. but you can complete the game without needing to do everything. Another negative point is that some parts feel a bit tedious, with mechanics that make you feel like they were put there just to increase the game length, they don't add much to the game. The story is a bit cheesy and has plotholes.Despite these negative points I've mentioned I can recommend getting this game in a sale or something due to it's amazing visuals and atmosphere. If you're a sucker for heartwarming stories the aforementioned shortcomings will not be such a big factor. Overall pretty cool game with some flaws."

I can enjoy a game if it is well made enough to look past the flaws it has.Ori and the Blind Forest has absolutly blown me away, surpassing any and all expectations I might of had for the game. This easily is one of the best games I have ever played.GameplayThe gameplay is extremely smooth and fluid. The controls are simple, but the ways you can use them lend themselves to complex use.The game is both easy to pick up, yet challenging. It has some spikes in the challenge but nothing that can't be overcome with a good application of skill.If I had to give any complaint about the gameplay it would be sometimes it puts too high of a mark on intuitivness. You have to figure out how to apply an old skill to a new situation with objects you never, or rarely, used the skill with before.GraphicsDownright amazing. Its an appealing middle between pure fantasy and reality. Its bright and colorful, and gloomy and atmosphric when it needs to be. Even on the very low reslution i had to use the graphics still look far better then many HD games these days.SoundsPerfect marks. The sound effects are fitting, and none of them annoying or grating. And the music is extremly pleasant to listen to.The only thing I can critize is that the official soundtrack doesn't have the title them on it.StoryThis proves very well that less is more. The story isn't over the top complicated... or even really complicated at all. It is told through sparse dialoge and a few cutscenes. It pulls on you before the prologe is over, and leaves you a little fuzzy after its over.LongetivityThe game will take you a while to beat on your first run, there is a lot to figure out. It certainly harkens a replay too, or several.Technical IssuesAs great as the game was there were a number of technical issues that I have to address.The game is very demanding graphically, I had to keep its resolution settings on 640x480 to play smoothly. There is no options to otherwise lower its visual demands on the machine, limiting the amount of computers that can play it.The text seems to be prerendered images. When the resolution is set low instead of the font point size lowering it instead becomes pixalated and hard to read, if not impossible.Occasionally the screen would stop scrolling so i had to move back and forth to get it to lock onto Ori again.And the last techincal issue would be, for me at least, the cutscenes kept self pausing while I was watching them.OverallThis is by far one of the best games I have played, period. Satisfying gameplay, smooth graphics, great audio, and a story that has you from begining to end. I would recommend picking this game up.Rating9/10"

Jaw-droppingly beautiful graphics (thought they might sometimes cause a bit of lag on slower machines, like mine), enthralling and powerful soundtrack, with each track fitting perfectly with each moment.Story's a bit lacking, if I must say, as there are many unanswered questions (I won't go into much detail to avoid spoilers) like, for example, Ori's origin, but honestly that is the least of my concerns, if you play this game, it should be about the experience, it might as well be considered an art game.Now about the game itself: It's your average metroidvania platformer (surprised not to see a ""Metroidvania"" tag up there) with a lot of exploration, secret hunting and, most of all, backtracking (not entirely essential to play the game, but completionists will sure do a lot of it). The controls are a bit clunky sometimes, specifically in parts that involve interacting with other moveable objects in order to progress, but as you master them you eventually look past this minor nuisance.Combat was particulary fun for me, and even if there is somewhat of a leveling system and skill trees, you'll find that grinding is hardly 10% of what you need to unlock all of the abilities. You'll most likely end up ""grinding"" simply by killing the enemies in your way as you explore the vast territory of Nibel.In an overall: Beautiful graphics and soundtrack, rather confusing story, yet pretty, when you look at the big picture, tight controls, for the most part and very fun combat.

It has an great storyline which is complimented by the beautiful visuals and soundtracks. Definitely a good game to buy for those who are always looking for visually appealing games!Now if you are interested in buying this game, I recommend you read my pros and cons first. Even though I found this game amazing, it might not be for everybody.Pros:- Stunning soundtracks- Atmospheric level design- Emmersive platforms with multiple layers (i.e. Not your standard mario platform levels)- Good character and creature design- Beautiful animations- Great storyline- Good and even unique mechanics- Very immersive- Very original- Has enough challenging moments- Nice little puzzle aspects (Not actual puzzles, but you gotta think a little)Cons:- Not easy for casual players: It may look like a beautiful and relaxing game but it is not. Some of the levels can be quite challenging for casual players, especially if you do not expect them. I encountered quite a few people who couldn't continue the game because of the sudden rise in difficulty. Which leads me to point 2.- Slightly strange level design. And with this I mean the difficulty. For seasoned players, this game is playable and a fun challenge here and there. But for people who are not used to games which require fast learning and reflexes, some levels might take their toll. There is no ''from easy to hard''.The hard will punch you in the face out of nowhere. This might not be a great thing for everybody.- No returning after you completed the game. Luckily I got 100% on everything, but if you do not have this before entering the final level: your screwed. Cause guess what, you can't go back to the main levels. Only way to get 100% on everything is to play the game again from the beginning.- Slightly bugged. Yes. Even though I didn't encounter any bugs in game, I know a few people who did.Level Bug. The game has a weird tendency to get bugged towards the end, making it impossible for players to continue as for example ''doors won't open'' or stuff is missing. This means that in some cases, players will have to start all over. From the beginning.Reseted save files. Sometimes the game will also reset your save file. For example you save the game at 84% completed. But the next time you go to your save file it may be at 67%. This doesn't happen often but it happens non the less.Achievements won't unlock. Even if you completed them 3 times (happened to me a lot). Don't know what causes this but it's annoying. But a bonus: sometimes the game will give you an achievement you didn't deserve. Weird but oh well."

Beautiful art style accompanied by top notch music throughout, solid mechanics that feel very fluid and comfortable, a good level of difficulty, fun abilities to play around with, and a pretty interesting story. You should really play this if you're into platformers at all or just great games in general.My only complaint, and it's not very significant, is the inability to revisit a file once the game is completed, as well as certain areas once finished. This makes obtaining some achievements needlessly annoying and has led to the creation of a program designed specifically to get around the issue. Other than that, there's nothing bad to say."

76561198054748342,Recommended,261570,17611175,"Posted: 19 August, 2015",all,I will beat Mugman.,"Ori and the Blind Forest looks like a simple platformer with similiarities to the new Rayman games and Super Meat Boy. I can assure you that while those accusations are true that is not a bad thing as it takes the best parts of both worlds and slams it together with a few new mechanics introduced frequently that keep the game fresh and exciting.Ori features a few new ideas including a skill tree in a platformer (say what?) and parkour features like bash. The skill tree offers alot of variety as in to what style you will play the game whether you want to have offence, guidance or utility. Bash is one of my favourite mechanics as it makes very interesting puzzles, fights and parkour. The only thing original I'll rat on is the boring combat system, I just feel like they could've done at least aiming rather than a boring autolock attack. They tried to spice it up by adding the Charge Bomb but I feel that it just kind of serves a purpose in the outside map, not in combat.The visuals are astounding, I swear if you are not playing it on max qualities it's a sin. Every part of the game looks fantastic from the haunting mysterious misty woods to the enchantingly beautiful thornfelt swamp, every part is an asset and a wonderful sight to see. Animation and effects look great too. The main characters animations are a stand point from graceful Ori to the slumpy Naru and the scale and fright emitting from Kuro. Attacks are bright and colourful which interact with the light of the background. I can't live with out mentioning the soundtrack which has vocals that bring the tunes out of the game and into real life with you whistling at the grocery shop. They all represent the moment they play in and add to the games already astounding atmosphere.In summary I'd say the Ori and the Blind forest is a bright and colourful Rayman / Super Meat Boy game with intriguing story, mechanics, music and gameplay. I think the only negatives of the game would be the slightly under welming combat, it's a bit short and some difficulty spikes but I find that like in Super Meat Boy this make it way more rewarding when you accomplish a difficult challenge.Overall Rating: 96% A must have for platformer enthusiasts.Please make a sequel Moon Studios ;)"

Some sections will let you grip your controller a little bit harder to say the least. However, its not frustrating, your failures encourage you to go agin, because the exceptional Soundtrack drives you and the game is just so much fun.If I weren't sold enough the water-tree escape I just played (people who played know what I mean) left me almost speechless.

It is perfect, poignant, and petrifying. Gareth Coker deserves a grammy for this magnum opus; this relentless orchestra of soaring and sinking feelings. I am in love with the music in this game. It will fill your soul and leave it aching.The visuals are bright, playful, and evocative. Every bounitful section of this Metroid-like adventure is a masterful experiment in color and style. The blues are like the brightest LEDs you have ever seen and the reds are like lava flowing from your monitor. It is jaw dropping every step of the way and always motion. Ori and the Blind Forest is a work of animated art that should be experienced by any gaming enthusiast or skeptic.The gameplay is fun and concise. The controls will never let you down. If you fail it will be your own fault and you will welcome the challenge with determination. The skill tree and leveling system will feel familiar to anyone familiar with side-scrolling adventures like Super Metroid. New abilities will give you access to new areas and secrets while a skill tree gives you multiple options on how to build your character and explore the world. The pace is addictive and it never feels tiring or over-complicated.What can I say about the story that wouldn't give away what makes it so amazing? All I can say is that I love Ori and the Blind Forest. It was my favorite game of 2015 and one of my favorite games of all time. More than any other game I have reviewed on Steam I implore you to give Moon Studio's first project a try. You will not regret it."

At the beginning the game feels a bit weird, is a very personal appreciation. The prologue is good but I needed a few hours into it to get use to the environments. Finally I started loving the game. I very recommend this game for Rayman fans. Is not as any other platformer, it has its own feeling is terms of character weight and combos. The map starts to expand it makes you want to backtrack from curiosity. Of course is a bit like metroidvania games and the art style and animations looks great. It has a few very good boss fights. More demanding as expected if you don't use the skill trees correctly and that is one of the points this game is deeper and different than Rayman Origins for instance. Good length and replayability. The main theme is good and it has some very good variants. Maybe they could've expand the tracks repertory a bit more for such great map but what is on it is pretty good! ;)"

New mechanic, tutorial, practice, mastery. The game has quite a few platform mechanics. The keymapping is well done, as you almost never use an unwanted action.  A few flaws can be found here and there when it comes to the clarity of what is expected from the player (in the last sequence for example, though they hint the action to use, I had to look it up).There is an incentive to go through the old areas again as ability points and powerups can be found there with the mechanics you find later in the game, and the shortcuts make it amazingly easy to zip around the one big level this game is.Ori's controls are reactive and pretty agile (no tank platformer here!)8.5/10 for this solid platformerThe game is also really userfriendly: the player can save whenever he wants, wherever he wants, and saving actually heals Ori: there is no penalty in death but to have to redo everything youve done since your last save (in the end you can have 24 ""save slots"" available, which is neat since they fill up pretty frequently)My verdict is that if you are looking for a platformer that'll meet either the eyes either the ego, this one's excellent. 9.5/10"

,Recommended,261570,20756908,"Posted: 25 January, 2016",all,Ezah,"Ori and the Blind Forest is a 2d action platformer in the Metroidvania style. At least, that's what I've heard, since I've never played the 2d Metroid games or the Castlevania games. All I know is that this game is an exemplary example of a smart control scheme and a well executed plan.For gameplay, you start off with a little spirit called Sein who has the ability to shoot a Spirit Flame. Your job is to platform your way to victory, avoiding monsters that can be annoying but are neither difficult nor unfair, as well as environmental hazards (apparently the world consists of about 70% thorn bushes, in every climate. Who knew?), while progressively getting more skills that mostly have a dual purpose of unlocking more creative ways to platform as well as to kill the enemies that keep popping up. These start with an ability to hop up the side of a wall and go to things such as Bash, which is an interaction with either a projectile or enemy that swaps places with it and forcibly flings both the enemy/projectile and Ori in opposite directions. There are a myriad of other abilities, but they do not become so numerous that the sheer list is cumbersome, nor are they just gimmicks where you have to use them for a single area and then you're done with them forever. Some do become obsolete (e.g. wall hop, double jump in favor of wall climb and triple jump), but they are all useful in their own right, and offer quite a few ways to deal with progressing through the game.As it is a Metroidvania style game, the platforming can be extremely unforgiving. Ori has relatively low HP and mana pools, which can be supplemented by finding Life and Energy Cells respectively that are hidden away throughout the game (most seem to become available when you get your last ability, but that may just be because that was when I unlocked the abilities to locate the secrets on the map). The game can occasionally be confusing as to where you need to go, but just like with any puzzle, careful exploration/manipulation (and a few dozen deaths or so) will generally allow you to figure out the mechanics of the area enough to follow the right path. Probably the most frustrating thing is that a lot of stuff can just instantly kill you, and you have a very minimal window to react in order to avoid getting plastered to the floor, skewered by a massive thorn bush, or deep fried in lava. I ended the game with about ~370 deaths, which feels absurd to me, but all of the frustration is definitely worth it as it makes it feel so much more rewarding when you finally break through and are able to hit that double jump into triple bash into rapid fire glide manipulation in order to navigate an extremely narrow corridor where one misstep just instantly kills you, even if you have a full 15 health with the damage reduction perk.An interesting little tidbit in this game is the ability tree. There are three different paths to choose from: (from right to left) survival, exploration, and offense. All three are linear and exclusive (though you can level up each of the three, if you want a particular ability you're going to have to commit to one for a good chunk of the game), and while many of the abilities don't seem that great, they actually do make a difference over the course of the game. Half cost on soul links (which are the player's way of saving the game) as well as being able to heal 2 health per cast can be extremely useful when going through a particularly hazardous area where you really don't want to do the entire sequence 5 bazillion times. It is also extremely useful for those of us who would like to 100% the game but don't want to spend 15 hours testing every patch of wall to figure out whether there is a secret passage behind it or not.For presentation, this game has that in spades. The game itself is gorgeous. I'm hard pressed to think of a single game with a better aesthetic, and there is always something going on in the background that lends itself to the current tempo of the game while not distracting the player overmuch. When all hell breaks loose, the game will let you know just how much trouble you are in, whether its having water pour in from half the screen, or having a lava tidal wave barrel down at you. And you'll get to experience it over and over again as you fail at least 10 times per epic escape due to having to run at 100 miles per hour while hitting precise jumps but also stopping because an instant kill beam is about to spew out of the wall but a chunk of the ceiling is coming down and you're gliding so you can't move horizontally very fast but you also have a monster spitting stuff at you that you have to Bash to get to hit the wall so that you can progress through that area and then another massive chunk of the ceiling comes crashing down where you have the space of about 1.5x the size of your character to squeeze in and then you have to navigate a little U bend with thorns which is no problem... Except you just flew straight into a steam geyser that is an instakill because it was hiding in the thorns just for you and gave you about a half second to react, while giving an extremely small window between 2 geysers and the thorns that you have to spam glide/stop in order to not fly too high or drop too low. Point being, the whole presentation of the game is absolutely fantastic, but there is a small problem in that it can be hard to identify exactly what can and can't kill you as some things can be blended into the background, but you have a knee jerk reaction to avoid that falling rock... Except it's falling in the background, not in the actual game. It is a small thing, but it can be quite frustrating when you're already frantically trying to escape a tree that is imploding upon itself.As for the story... I really don't want to spoil any of it at all. Suffice to say, all of those reviews say that it is a tearjerker are true. The developers did a fantastic job of getting you to care for the characters in the game, and the progression of the story continues in that arc. It's even more impressive to me since it all comes about by the actions and interactions of the characters, not by dialogue. There is a narrator that chimes in now and then (I think its the same language as the opening to Circle of Life from the Lion King, so you'll have to read the narration) to guide the character and fill in knowledge of the lore, but is altogether unobtrusive. I love to play video games and read books for their stories, and it has been a very long time since I have experienced a story that made me care about the characters this much.I found this game to be an absolutely fantastic experience, and will most likely play it every now and then down the road. It's just one of those games that is not only a great experience with a good story, but also has fun, fulfilling gameplay, and the icing on the cake is that it is just absolutely beautiful. I give this game a 9.5/10 and wholeheartedly recommend this game to anybody and everybody. It is definitely more difficult than most games I have played, but the gameplay is altogether not terribly unfair and is extremely rewarding to play through."

Not even an overstatement!The music alone strikes my heart strings...seriously felt like crying after listening to it for like 20 seconds. The story is beautiful and again, makes me want to cry.  The characters are cute, well designed and all play an important part in the story (which I think is important).The actual gameplay is solid and easy to understand, but difficult to master. Any of abilities you gain will never become obselete and you will use each one constantly. The use of ""Spirit links"" in the game is very clever and actually very useful; just remember to save often or you'll have to do it all again if you die.The only problems I have is that the time taken to finish the game was quite short with only about 8 or so hours, and that sometimes the controls can get a bit frustrating when trying to do some things.All in all, Ori and the Blind Forest is an emotional rollercoaster (in a good way) with an incredible story and great gameplay, and even though the story is wrapped up nicely in the end, I'm seriously hoping for a sequel, even if it takes another 4+ years to make it.

,Recommended,261570,17006057,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,Skip to my Lee,"This is one of the best metroidlike games money can buy. It has by far the best story/characters out of all of them. The game looks absolutely gorgeous, the progression system is well thought out and the skill tree actually has a sizable impact on the game. It would be THE best metroidlike game if not for the following gripes.Ori moves a tad too sluggish for my taste. Just a tad. To make Ori move really smooth and acrobatic, the developers favoured style over substance a little bit too much. It's just a minor gripe, the game controls really well, it' a long way removed from Rayman, but it's not quite Super Meat Boy either.By far my biggest beef is that there are multiple areas in the game that become inaccessible once you passed through them once. They also host important items that are gone forever when you finish that area. Now it's my understanding that metroidlike games are supposed to present you items along the way that you simply can't reach without progressing further so you have to come back later to pick them up. Backtracking is an integral part of this type of game and this one has plenty of those instances. So at first you walk around, inaccessible items left and right, no big deal, you can come back later and pick them up, ocd is kept in check. Suddenly the last area vanishes off the face of the earth and you know you didn't collect everything because you thought you could get back there to clean up. Suddenly your ocd kicks in to maximum overdrive and you have to collect everything right now, even though there are plenty of legitimate unreachable items scattered around the map. It's kinda like a bait and switch and left me a little bit disappointed.The game also has a lot of trial and error passages where you have to make live-or-die-decisions on the fly (literally, mid-air) while being chased by OHK entities. It's satisfying when you finally get through but also very frustrating as you inch closer to the end, with every death respawning you at the very beginning of the passage.I put a lot of emphasis on the things I didn't like in this review so it might come across as very negative, but when you read this just think of the perfect (metroid)game and subtract the negatives from it. The game is still very good and the current Metacritic average of 88% is pretty much exactly where I would place the game.TL;DR: It's the best Metroidlike game you can buy on Steam by a landslide."

It is very simplistic, and mostly consists of spamming attack while jumping around avoiding enemy projectiles. However, due to the combat not being the main focus of the game, this is forgivable and hardly noticable. If you're expecting a combo-oriented fighting platformer like Guacamelee or Dust: An Elysian Tail, this is not the game you're looking for. If you're looking for a beautiful game with a heartbreaking storyline and really fun platforming, then look no further!Took me about 9 hours to 99% the game, which is well worth $20 in my opinion, however it is frequently on sale which makes it an even better value. My only qualm is that once you enter the final zone, Mount Huro, you cannot go back and finish collecting the secrets in previous areas. If you want to 100% the game remember to collect everything prior to entering Mount Huro.Overall, 9/10"

And I currently have 156 games on Steam alone. You will not belive how good a 2D game can be before you have played Ori and the Blind Forest.PROS:- This game has the most incredible graphics and art design. Not just for a 2D game but for any game.- The beauty of this game is completely breathtaking. I'd wish there was more games that came even close- The story of the game is hauntingly beautiful; Hits you right in the feels from the very beginning- Perfect balance between casual, puzzle solving platforming and adrenaline inducing action which will keep you on the edge of your seat- The music is completely mesmerizing and immersive- Superb optimized for both keyboard and controller - You have full control of the character in every way. You will not experience a 2D platform game where you have more perfect precision controls- Gameplay is fun and you will enjoy blasting your enemies- Progression system is perfectly executed. Even as your powers grow, the game will never get too easy.CONS:- You will die a lot. Well not as much a con as a warning. You will get really frustrated with how much you will die in this game. You will probably shout at the monitor. But in the end it will be worth every second.- You will probably be sad by the time the game is completed- Upon completion you will not be able to return to the completely discovered world. This also means that you will not be able to retrieve some of the orbs you missed or completely unlock the final skill talent.- For the above reason the replay value is somewhat reduced. Although I would personally gladly replay the entire game again.CONCLUSION:I would rate Ori and the Blind Forest a 10/10 - Almost as perfect as a game can be. If I was forced to only own a single 2D game title, it would be this one. Buy this game a soon as possible. Do NOT miss this title for any reason. It is a must have for your collection.We need more games like Ori and the Blind Forest. Game developers that put this much time and effeort in a 2D game, really deserves every ounce of support they can possibly get.I have extremely high expectations for future releases from Moon Studios, the company behind Ori and the Blind Forest.This is how the team behind describe themselves: ""The company mainly focuses on highly refined gameplay mechanics within its products and prides itself on an excessive ‘iterative polish’ process"". I would have to agree with them on that one. I would pride myself as well if I had a title like this to show for it."

Both the art and music/sound design are superb.The narrative is quite simple and wholesome. The developers do a good job of getting you to empaphize with the characters. The plot isn't anything massively complex but I found it sophisticated enough to be interesting.The game is suitable for slightly more mature children, being quite sad in places and dealing with (non-graphic) death themes.Controls are mostly repsonsive and tactile, as would expect from a platformer.My initial play-through took about 8 hours but I didn't 100% everything.My second play-through (not particularly rushing it) took 5 hours to reach 100%.Almost bug free. Very good quality assurance and bug patching.My only criticsms of this game would be:Any ability requiring aiming tends to be a bit of a pain using the d-pad, as if the designers didn't consider this option very well. You can switch to the analogue sticks for more precise aiming (KB+M is even better) in this situtation, however, it would be nice if this wasn't necessary.Dungeons are inaccessible after completion, so you can't backtrack through them to get parts of achievements if you want them.Spikes in difficulty at the end of dungeons. The game turns suddenly from a light platformer with puzzle elements to a hardcore platformer that expects you to complete large sections without save points.Due to the difficulty spikes, it might be too challenging for younger children."

REALLY close. The soundtrack by Gareth Coker is absolutely beautiful; the graphics are sublime; the story will tug the heartstrings; the protagonist couldn't be any more adorable. Finally, the gameplay: it's awesome. The controls are tight and responsive, and the game provides a healthy level of challenge without once feeling unfair.  Is this game perfect? No, because such a thing is impossible. But this game is nearly perfect, and that's all we can really ask for, now can we? Buy this game. You won't regret it."

The art and animations are really nice looking and also the soundtrack sounds well and is really fitting.The game is well structuctured but doesn't encourage exploration at because you will just reach dead ends where you can only do something later.The combat is extremely simple, you just mash the X button and dodge attacks. By the way, you die rather quickly but can save when you want (with limitations).While the story and the atmosphere starts out really nice, it doesn't really hold that feeling. The story is not well detailed as you would hope and I stopped caring about it after the great intro.It took me about 10h to make a 100% run (my first one). The game encourages you to replay the game another two times because of achievements (which can be annoying). Little warning, the achievements are really buggy in this game.So overall I would recommend this game. It has nice art and it also plays well."

I cried at almost every cut scene, don't you judge me! Also, more importantly, expect to want to kill yourself playing this game. The first third of the game is a pretty easy and fun platformer game. Straight forward and simple to understand. But once you get to the Ginso tree and beyond, you may want to either eat a bullet or swallow glass for how much the difficulty ranks up. If you're not a hard core gamer, or proficient at platform games, you will die. You will die so much you will wish your real life would end.

,Recommended,261570,20329752,"Posted: 5 January, 2016",all,「🌟」constraint™,"So, imagine Trine gameplay with Life is Strange/Last of Us feels. That's basically what this game is. Hits straight for the emotions within 15 minutes of the game starting. Just prepare yourself.In terms of gameplay, it plays like any other platformer with a bit of parkour involved. Abilities gained through experience don't feel too overpowered and the puzzles make use of the abilities very well. Like any other platformer, the game is going to tease you by showing you some item or ability that you can't get without further advancing into the story.This brings us to the story, told by an unknown entity (a light-being?) in a foreign, non-terrestrial language as games of fantasy usually do. But, it's not tacky or humorous like Trine. Instead, the story-telling is atmospheric and ties in extremely well to the theme and graphics of the game.This brings us to the graphics and the game is absolutely gorgeous. Trine looked a bit cartoonish and more 3D-ish than this game which suited well with its themes and story-telling. This game is much more 2D but boasts multiple layers of foregrounds and backgrounds inside and outside of cutscenes.Unlike Trine, which is a traditional platformer, this game is more parkour oriented with more parkour abilities being offered as you progress through the story or buying them using your experience.I haven't finished the game yet so I can't fully tell you guys how well the game was made or what improvements could be made so I'll keep updating this review as I complete it. But the overwhelming positive reviews on Steam should speak for themselves. If you enjoyed Trine and enjoy a bit of 2D parkour, this is your game.EDIT: Just a follow up after finishing the game.This game is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing top notch. For the price I paid, this was worth twenty times some of the AAA titles that I've played. The ""bash"" skill isn't a bash at all. Don't get fooled; that skill is one of the most satisfying ones in the game. After you unlock it, you're going to be finding yourself using it over and over again.Story-wise, this game does what Life is Strange failed to do: give a DECENT, ♥♥♥♥ING ENDING. Remember the prologue? Do NOT forget it because it will come back in the end. Your enemies are not what they seem. Misunderstandings run amok. Feels flow freely. Emotions seep very deep. Prepare yourself: you're in for a ride.Much like Life is Strange, this game would only be a shell of what it is without the soundtrack. I'm not much for vocals but the main menu theme vocals ABSOLUTELY tug on my heart strings. Top notch tracks with vibrant, eloquent, classy as ♥♥♥♥ vocals. Music changes flawlessly between levels without a hitch and it plays extremely well with the cut scenes as well.Enough of me jacking this game off like some 2 cent hooker. Let's get to the one HORRIBLE, DEPLORABLE, UNFORGIVEABLE design choice by Moon Studios: once you finish the game, your save is locked.That's right folks. Once you complete the game, you are NOT allowed to go back to the maps to retrieve the left over goodies sprawled throughout the map. Forgot a few upgrades? ♥♥♥♥ you. Achievements require you to max out your skills? ♥♥♥♥ you. OH, YOU WANT TO MONG THOSE POOR, INNOCENT CREATURES WITH YOUR MAXED OUT PUSS-IN-BOOTS!?!? ♥♥♥♥. YOU.Honestly, what the hell kind of choice is that? You create this beautiful map with exceptional design and you lock us out of our own saves? Are you trying to create artificial longevity? Why taint such a beautiful ♥♥♥♥ing game with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that? Don't get me wrong, I'll probably go back to the game if I have nothing else to play but that is just some messed up♥♥♥♥♥♥Even so, I'm not going to change my positive rating of the game. If you can snag the game at a discount, more power to you. If you absolutely love 2D platformers, I'd tell you to buy it full price so you can start appreciating it as soon as possible.

,Recommended,261570,17267851,"Posted: 28 July, 2015",all,UncleYar,"Excellent Metroid/Castlevania-style game. I was a bit skeptical of the game's depth at the beginning and the abilities to acquire didn't sound that exciting. However, I was soon conquered by the excellent level design, containing just the right level of challenge and many hidden secrets. Some areas are bursting with spikes and really need you to use wall jump and double-jump perfectly: usually that would mean a game I avoid, but they had the intelligence of letting you save where you want and get back into the action instantly after death, Super Meat Boy-style.The graphics and music are of course wonderful, the screenshots don't lie. But there's a great platformer in there, it's not only an art game!"

I know I was playing a GOTY contender in the first 3 minutes. I've completed it with 100% in roughly 10 hours. Most of that was trying to solve some tricky platform puzzles. Don't be scared of failure. While there are a handful of difficult parts of Ori most of the game simply is challenging enough to make you feel like your playing by skill. One the most challanging parts you may try many times to complete but you'll be met with a great sense of accomplishment once you've conquered them.For replayability, the tight controls and skill based mechanics seem to be a great match for speed runners. Even if your not into speed running exploration and the platform puzzles are fun. The entire game can be played in 10m intervals (withe the exceptions of two events) which is great for casual players.Must buy."

,Recommended,261570,14939598,"Posted: 17 March, 2015",all,Drawed,"It's not often that I actually enjoy a game enough to get off my♥♥♥♥♥and write a review on it, so here goes nothing.Platformers have always been a guilty pleasure of mine. Be it 2D, 3D, or some sort of other sort of D, I've always been a fan of it. I bought this game on a whim based on a recommendation Kudo Tsunoda gave me on Facebook, and it is easily one of the best purchases on Steam I've ever made.I've played more platformers than I would like to admit, and like any medium of entertainment, they eventually get stale. There are only so many variations you can make on a single genre over the course of several decades without running out of ideas. So a common issue that many modern platformers have today is they focus more on having some new gimmick than they do on having a fundamentally sound game that is actually enjoyable to play.This is exactly what Ori does right. It doesn't give you some weird mechanic that is barely ever used yet is forced down your throat like. It favors ideas and mechanics that have been tried and true, and then perfects them to a point. This is easily on par with Super Meat Boy in terms of fluidity of controls and the implementation of mechanics.Progression systems in platformers are always a bit hard to pull off. Often times you'll see a power up behind a wall that you think you can break, or a health orb on a ledge just barely out of reach, and you know that you'll eventually have to come back to this area later in the game once you get the needed ability to make the jump or smash the wall. This can lead to a tedious experience that almost discourages initial explanation of the map. What Ori does that helps this is the gradual evolution of the map. As you unlock and learn to use different abilities, various events take place on the map that allow you to better utilize the abilities you've just unlocked, and gives you a reason to go back and explore areas that you've been to before.The story is great, and honestly I don't want to spoil it so I'm just going to leave it at that.9/10Apparently I need to edit this for some sort of badge."

The gameplay is extramly fluid and responsive. The game does pose a chalenge but it is never overly dificult. as you navigate the large map you never really feel lost; the game does a fantastic job of letting you know about where you are at before you even open up the map. There is a small amout of problems i had with this game: one was that I was going for all the colectables when I decited to get the story out of the way, after comleting it I wasnt able to revisit the save and had to start a whole new file. this led into another issue, because i already knew the way to get to some areas I wanted the colectables from, I found out ways i could get to them without obtaining the skill i needed. THis led to me getting stuck and i had to abandon that save. This issue was disapointing but these little tricks you can do to skip areas adds to the replayability of the game, and it alows the game to be spedrun in an extreamly interesting fashon."

This game stands out with the quality of its artwork and its interesting mechanics. Gorgeous at 4k resolution.The storyline is not complex, but tugs at the heartstrings a little bit, and has a couple of surprises. There are numerous achievements to be had, some which are based around how the game is completed, which possibly requires multiple playthroughs to max out the achievements. That aside, there is not a lot of replay to be done here.There is a newer version of this game, the definitive edition, which adds some new features. There's nothing in the first release that isn't also in the definitive edition, so recommend playing that one instead.A minor detractor is that some areas cannot be revisited once completed, which prevents seeing/doing/collecting certain things, thus affecting some achievements if not already done, requiring additional playthroughs. Similarly the final area cannot be exited once completed. These issues have been resolved in the definitive edition.+ artwork+ gameplay+ ""interestingness""+ some replay per achievements+- story- missable areas / commitment to finishing once in the final area- little replay once maxed out"

The game can be challenging but, nothing too overwhelming. The game utilizies a lot of fresh platforming mechanics. The checkpoint system is really neat but, I found it a little frustrating having to repeat areas after you just cleared them.The story is basically feels the simulator but, I felt that the ending almost defeated the purpose of it.Even though the game is a dream to play I felt that its weakest points were the environmental desgin choices (gameplay wise). It's clearly influenced by games like Metroid but, it falls a little short on elements such as blending areas together or letting you discover new areas using new power-ups.Fyi, avoid playing this game with a used and abused ps3 controller lol.8 out 10 soul links"

It's slow to build up, takes a while before it becomes truly interesting, but it's worth it. It's extremely solidly built, in that as you gain more abilities the devs found great ways to keep it challenging and interesting. It never really feels contrived or forced and everything flows very naturally. The game was probably play tested to hell because it never breaks and you never get stuck. Many many times as I played I was dumfounded and amazed by the detail and time that the devs must have put into this game, not to mention how wonderfully challenging and unique the areas in the game are in contrast to one another.

,Recommended,261570,14992454,"Posted: 21 March, 2015",all,luison.cpp,"Like you already saw in the trailer and the screenshots, the art style in this game is amazing I can be hours writing about that art style but you can see it by yourselves.Now about the game itself, the first 10 minutes of the game have almost no-interaction and are like an animated short film, fortunately, a very good one.After that 10 minutes, all changes and starts the real game.This game is a very standard metroidvania, very challenging and with a lot of focus in platforming (relying very much in things like wall jump, double jump, and jump impulse yourself in enemies or enemies projectiles). I think the weak point in this game is the combat, it's very original but at the same time, I feel the combat erratic. If you played Aquaria, it's that kind of combat.About the level design, it's ok, I think it tries to replicate some things from Super Metroid but with little success, for example:It has a part when you fell in a tall pit and you need to gain abilities to return, but the game doesn't have the claustrophobic feel, so the feeling of ""I want to go out of the pit"" is not strong at all; and also, this game has no fast travel (very risky for a metroidvania), and tries to reduce the backtracking relying only in the level design, you can activate switches to open shortcuts and the new abilities allows you to take more shortcuts, but still it's not as good as Super Metroid in reducing the backtracking, I think it could be better with a limited fast travel(like the ones found in SOTN or Guacamelee).Overall it's a solid metroidvania game with great art style. Buy it if you like metroidvanias and have patience for some tricky platforming sections(like Guacamelee or Super Meat Boy), and don't buy it if you expect something like Journey of don't want the game to be too challenging in platforming."

The sounds and visuals are the best part about this game and the character you play as is adorable. The game is a bit hard for non-pro-platformers like me, particularly the escape sequences. While some of them you could theoretically get on your first try, one stands out as being totally trial and error on where you needed to go which meant you needed to die in order to know how to beat it, something I think it abit unfair. The only truly sad part, as is true of most puzzle and platforming games, it has pretty limited replay-ability.

I cannot believe the extent to which this game has moved me, but one thing I do know, I'm going to be on the lookout for any Moon Studios productions. If they happened to ask me for another twenty dollars I would just give it to them and say thank you. Now let me try to give a short, yet detailed description as to why that is.I was completely drawn in. When I sit down to play a new game there is a natural anxiety that hinges on how a game performs over, or is shadowed by, its expectations. Dominated and owned. I was in the game immedietly and was more worried about mastering my movements than I would be if my house was burning down.Controls are on point. I can't remember how many times I found myself flipping and twisting into bliss rather than advancing the plot. Dynamic is a bland way of putting it but the creativity involved is award winning. The interface that stands between you and Ori is seemless to say the least.The music is  a standalone masterpiece. Great job if I can talk to the designers rather than consumers for a second. I think this was the ultimate key by which I felt immersed inside with the controls being on par or a close second. It felt like the game embraced me if that makes any sense. I was feeling what it wanted me to feel, when it wanted me to feel it.10/10"

I think it acheived a good balance. Visually it reminded me of Trine, super saturated colors, vibrant, lush environments.

After I launched it, I kept listening to the intro music for a few minutes, just looking at the screen that kindly asked me to press any button to start the game.What Ori does well is a sense of progress, player direction without intervention, visual and audio feedback, animation quality, art direction, evoking emotions at main story points through both storytelling, gameplay pacing and music. Also, controls are really tight, which is always important for a platformer.Small CONs: It is a story-driven, linear platformer, so after a playthrough, there isn't much motivation to play it again. There are a few gameplay sections that were hard for me to navigate through, mainly due to the game's character being turned upsight-down and the character's movement direction and the character's movement on the screen no longer aligning."

The graphics are great and the art style is timeless, they are so good that I've just recently started my second playthrough and still adore how much detail the developers have put into the game.The game is difficult, yet not as punishingly difficult as I was made to believe; there is however one area in the game that presents a significant spike in difficulty - Ginso tree I am looking at you.You are mostly free to explore different areas of the game and are only forced to follow the main objectives at a relatively late point. Some areas and power ups are however gated, so that you can only reach them once you have progressed to a certain point in the main story.All in all I absolutely recommend this game to anybody, even if you don't consider yourself a fan of these types of games; I am also not big into plattformers, having played none for several years prior to ""Ori and the Blind Forest"".Give it a try, if you haven't already. You will probably not regret it.Edit: Give Kuro a hug! :-)"

,Recommended,261570,20315502,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,MrEaters,"Due to the fact that many people focus on the story in their reviews (and this game's story is a very good one, by the way), I will be focusing this one on everything else.First of all, the music. There's a reason the (current) DLC is the soundtrack. The music in the trailers showcases the quality all the way through the game. I can't say I'd spend $10.00 on it, but the sheer amount of effort put into something that many games give a half-effort to shows an eye for detail that really makes this game great.Going along with that, the artwork is amazing. Quite simply, this game is beautiful. The fact that much of the background landscape was hand-painted just adds to it.Now, the game itself. It is a very difficult platformer. There are puzzles and reaction obstacles that can be very difficult to get through. However, this game has the somewhat unique mechanic of being able to save (almost) anywhere you want to, as long as you've got the energy. Early on, energy does pose a somewhat limiting factor, but once you've found about 5 cells, there is really no limit to how much you can save. Save before a difficult segment. Save after said difficult segment. Save because you haven't saved in a while. You get the idea. My biggest issue, though, is with the escape sequences (see list below).I'll make an itemized list because that's what people seem to like these days.PROS:- Beautiful artwork- Amazing music- A deep story with a powerful message- Save anywhere- Fair and balanced (no, really, this isn't sarcasm)- Challenging- haven't been challenged by a game in a long time so this was refreshing- Simple gameplay elements used in unique waysCONS- Most of these are very nitpicky:- Main character moves fast enough that landing on small platforms is tricky- Screen shake can cause mistimed jumps or double jumps, ruining timing ESPECIALLY on escape sequences- Escape sequences can be confusing on where to go, and where the ""death wall"" is (esp. true in Ginso tree)- Escape sequences are very long with no save points, require a lot of reaction jumping, and have very little room for error- Obstacles seem inconsistent with how much damage they give (I once landed on the same patch of spikes twice in a row with different damage amounts taken)- Can be unclear what's an obstacle and what's not due to foreground obstruction or background artworkOverall rating: 8.5/10. The escape sequences need work but everything else is almost perfect."

This review will rate each of the games elements, and then have an overall conclusion:Story - 8/10 (spoiler free).There is not a lot to say about the story in Ori, other than it is really solid. What I feel is most recognizable, is that the story is so well paced, and the world/story recognizes what you have done earlier in the game. The only bad thing I can really say about the story, is that the characters backstories are never really described ingame, but I suppose that could also be part of the charm.Visuals and sounds - 10/10This is hands-down the best looking game I have played in 2015. Maybe it is not a particularly taxing game, but the asthethic is the most beautiful I have seen since Trine 2. A huge pro is that the game also runs really well on my machine, and I haven't really heard of people who had problems running the game. The soundtrack and the sounds of the game are also as perfect as the visuals. The music never feels out of place, and it can go from raging and pumping, to emotional and slow, which depends on what you are doing in the game. This might not be uncommon for games, but I just feel like Ori does it so exceptionally well, that the music actually suceeds in having an impact on you. There is no real voiceacting in the game, as all of the characters speak in a sort of alien language, but for me that was one of the things which also stood out to be immersive.Gameplay - 8/10Ori's gameplay is solid, and I especially found the platforming enjoyable, but not so much the combat. The best thing about the combat and platforming, is probably when you acquire new moves, but the game does not forget your old moves, and you end up using all of your acquired moves in the last level. I find this to be fantastic, as it challenges the player to think fast. The platforming is extremely diverse, but the combat as pointed out earlier, can be a little dull and samey. Your main combat move is just to click close to your enemies, and then you will fire homing beams at them. But again, I don't think the developers wanted the combat to be a main part of the game, as it is sometimes blended into the platforming, and thereby making combat moves into platforming moves.The game can be extremely punishing, especially if you don't go out of your way to find hidden pickups, which I certainly thing that you should do, as I found that to be one of the most enjoyable parts of the game. The game makes very little use of autosaves, except in some places, so you will have to save by yourself. This can both me useful, but also extremely annoying, as you can basically complete allmost the entirety of a level, die, and then be respawned close to the beginning.Overall - 8,5/10I really think that this game is exceptional, and I was really surprised to find such a polished product then I bought the game. This game shone through as my favorite platformer of a loooong long time almost in the 2 first hours.I definetely recommend Ori and the Blind Forest!"

As far as the actual gameplay, I'm not usually a big fan of platformers but the controls in Ori felt intuitive and seamless most of the time. Even though I died more times than I would ever admit to anybody and got super frustrated in some spots, my interest in the rest of the game drove me to keep trying (and trying...and trying...) until I finally got to the next section. I'm not the most strategic or careful person, though, so it might just be me...One of this game's biggest strengths that makes it stand out to me is its storytelling. There's not a ton of dialogue, as Ori does not speak, yet there were many powerful and moving moments in this game that made me more emotional than I ever anticipated I would be over a game with a tiny forest cat sprite! The other huge strength that goes hand in hand with the storytelling, for me, is the soundtrack. I'm biased towards any soundtrack that uses a live orchestra, but the music for this game is truly breathtaking and I still get those same emotional moments when listening to the soundtrack all on its own. That intense connection between the plot elements and the music playing at those moments means somebody did their job awesomely, and that truly changes the experience of a game for me.In short: I'm not sure I can find anything to dislike about this game! Art, controls, plot, and music are all fantastic. Even after dying [redacted] times in my first playthrough I still ain't even mad."

,Recommended,261570,20237557,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,KnightViper[FT],"At first sight, reminds me of Dust: An Elysian Tail. It plays very differently though. It's less about upgrading your character with all these fancy attacks, and more about unlocking mechanics of your character that help you become more and more mobile. The game is entirely about perfecting every jump, double jump, boost, and many more movements to be precise as possible to beat segments. This does become frusterating at times, but maybe that's myself more than others. Luckily in most places you can save whenever you want (granted you have enough energy, a resource require to save and do some other things).  Beware, if you want to achieve 100%, multiple play throughs may be required, and some places require you getting everything the first time visiting in that playthrough, as those areas become locked and the only way back is to start a new game.  And as far as story, it was very enjoyable, but nothing that will nock your socks off.  (9-12 hour playthrough)"

Ori and the Blind Forest is an absolute joy to play - Its a game that's (while light on story) heartwarming when it needs to be, and consistently entertaining. It rewards masterful use of its varied movement mechanics - and man, does this pay off. You'll be gliding through insane environmental puzzles and performing crazy feats of agility.Clocking in at ~10-12 hours, its doesn't overstay its welcome. That being said, I would have still enjoyed a few more hours. The unlock system is a standard gig - new movement types unlock access to previously locked areas etc - These are just challening enough to unlock for it to feel like you've earned them.Need I even mention the aesthetics of this game? Its drop dead GORGEOUS. I'd almost recommend it for the art and soundtrack alone at this point! Runs at a buttery smooth fps consistently too! (Although, I did have minor problems with crashing, but as far as I'm aware thats an extremely niche issue)Overall, if you have any interest in mechanically diverse, fast and fluid metroidvania games with a dash of feels, do not hesitate to play this game.

It deserves far more than that.Story: 10/10The story is minimalist (before definitive edition as it's not out yet), but it feels incredibly beautiful, well thought out, and awesome. I wish there was more to go off of, but I don't really want to spoil the game in the review...Music: 11/10Gareth Coker did a phenomenal job with the score of this game, and I have yet to find more than a handful of games that have matched this game in musical prowess.Gameplay: 10/10The gameplay feels amazingly responsive, smooth, and realistic. Ori moves just as he/she should. A platformer at its core, Ori and the Blind Forest takes fairly simple and easy to learn (but very hard to master) concepts, and improves on them immensly. As the game progesses, you gain several abilities that only make the gameplay much more satisfying.Art: 48794857349857394857394857/10Oh sweet mother of god...the art in this game is literally god tier. This game has my favorite art style of all of the games I've ever played. EVER. Everything in the world is crafted with the sole intention of being beautiful enough to make you pass out. There is not one asset in this game that was not anything short of incredible.Complaints: This game has a strange tendency to slow down, and since there isnt frame skipping, the literal speed of the game slows to a crawl. This is a recognized problem, but if you have a powerful machine, you should run it without any hiccups whatsoever. P.S. I'm running with an i5 3570k and an msi r9 390 for reference.Playtime: 8-14 hours for one playthrough.Overall: YEEEEES!!!!Do yourself a favor and pick up this game. Even if it's not on sale it is 100 percent worth it. I consider myself a fan of the platformer/metroidvania genre, and this game has blown me away and continues to do so with every second of gameplay."

76561198134023890,Not Recommended,261570,33652378,Posted: 19 July,all,KirinGale,"Ori, for all its visual splendor and promise of titillating gameplay, is both a misleading and frustrating game. Frankly I am surprised by the majority of positive reviews, as on many outside forums there are a slew of complaints and I feel like this product did not necessarily live up to its description or promises. As I know there may be those who will rush to the title’s defense I will say that I have, in fact, completed every map (but Forlorn Ruins) to 100% completion on my first run-through.FLR sits at a frustrating 98%, if you were interested.I have put a fair number of hours into this game, and I hope that, given this consideration, my below criticism can be considered fair.To me this game, when first advertised, seemed both captivating and fun; I was enchanted and purchased Ori outright for the display of its visuals. Sadly, I ended up having to tuck my purchase away for a few years simply because my old laptop couldn't handle the game and would often crash given its poor capabilities... Sometime later I splurged on a shiny, new desktop and was ready to figuratively dust the game off and play it again… It played slow-mo lag on a native resolution of 1920x1080. I have managed a fix in that Ori operates well at a lower resolution, but still  it has its stutters in specific areas of the map. I grew ired by the fact that this game was never optimized for anything less than a very pricey 1GB graphics card, and that, upon subsequent re-release of Ori the newer version was not free and was only given a short-term discount.If you wanted the updates/re-release at a discount you needed to re-purchase it with a now defunct coupon, your only options currently are to pay full price.I felt cheated by this tactic and audience preference, and I’m sure others have as well. While it is disappointing that the makers seemingly lack courtesy or foresight, that end does not entail my true and overall dissatisfaction with the gameplay itself.This game is difficult, and anyone who tells you otherwise has been blessed with skills wrought of their dedicated practice with controllers. I think some forget that not everyone has the same acuity or dexterity for these types of platformers(of which many of us were caught unawares as to Ori being ""that type"" of platformer). If you're one familiar with MegaMan(or other early NES/2D titles)you may fair well with Ori -- in fact it’s likely a good fit for you or you’ve already played it. For those of us who are inexperienced with such franchises, or casual gamers, or very young -- do not buy this game. The pretty, inviting, story-book graphics are a façade of its tricky and monstrous levels of difficulty.If for whatever reason you still want to try your hand at this gamethat will undoubtedly contribute to the shortening of your lifespanbe aware that rates of success first-playthrough are phenomenally low. Also be open to the idea of making Ori commit a few tens of seppuku as an act of revenge for your losses.Fluid aesthetics, wonderful music, and a charming story are to sheep’s wool where gameplay itself is like leaping into the chasmal maw of a beast. Hazard placements, mob spawns, dungeons, abilities -- all meant to challenge and guide the player – for even the simplest of tasks often become hindrances which contribute to the chewing and spitting up of repeated missteps. The game calls for nearly pin-point accuracy with movement and landings -- failure delivers unto the player repeated deaths for near-miss jumps into hazards, or the unfortunate timing of an enemy projectile(and sometimes it's just that the hitboxes for the hazards are on the fritz, and you'll either be immune to, or take from, copious amounts of damage).Forlorn Ruins was a dungeon which seemed to encapsulate the issues with this method of trial andpunishmenterror. The early-game of Ori is fun and introduces you to the manipulation of environmental factors (mobs/spawns, lamps, jumping, climbing, puzzles, etc.) to progress... For Forlorn Ruins it asks you to throw all that away for the gimmick of ""functionality loss as challenge"". This dungeon in particular felt clunky, slow, and the most unforgiving in its design. This area gives no forewarning to the sudden inversion of your movement controls, to your being forced to scale walls and ceilings laced with traps, nor to its inexplicably asking you to “slow-your-roll” to move a cumbersome object from point A to point B.Forlorn Ruins, as a dungeon(pivotal or central trials key to Ori's progression), felt lazy and disjointed from the rest of the game. The later dungeons seem as though they ran out of ways to provide challenge and responded by inundating areas with nearly impassable terrain to simulate difficulty. You would think of dungeons(as they are traditionally in games)as a way to capitalize upon a player's current skills and accomplishments, mildly upping the stakes of their quest and ushering them towards rewards that increase their rank or ability...This is not the case with Ori.Ori instead decides it a clever idea that dungeons be the places of torment and anguish they are classically defined to be. While each dungeon poses the suggestion of utilizing new skills and abilities, the introduction to these concepts are neither intuitive nor rewarding. The adventures through these levels bear no true prizes, as upon completion of a dungeon it is unceremoniously blocked off forever whileNaviSein does not hesitate to demand your next objective.Youareteased with a cute little cut-scene and story-progression, but that does not ring with the same sense of satisfaction found when you can progress the storyanddefeat a boss, plunder loot, or gain a new and crucial ability. The escape sequences from these dungeons, again, can be rather arduous as they ask for pixel and time perfect maneuvers. Inability to pull off these ""sweet moves"" results in being reset to an event's starting position.While some issues I have with Ori relate to its marketing being inconsiderate towards buyers of the original copy, it too is partly bred out of my feelings of the title being misleading towards its audience about its content -- neither showcasing nor giving probable cause that it may not be for everyone. I have found, in terms of gameplay, that the unintuitive nature of Ori stems from the dissonance between its aesthetics and mechanics: Ori lacks specificity in assigning objectives to the player; its method of teaching the player is vacuous, unrewarding, and uninvolved; it provides no difficulty slider or learning curve for players of weaker skill; and to impose a false sense of difficulty many of its levels seem unnecessarily littered with hazards and spawns.A first-time player may notice that, by leaps and bounds rather than by skips and hops, how disjointed the early levels can be from the difficulty of even the early dungeon stages.Overall, I am an unhappy camper. I have gotten to Mt. Horu, but I cannot find the will to continue any further. I am once again stinted by the puzzle at the entrance of a cavern, where instead of spikes I have super-heated ground upon which I take damage and cannot save. If Mt. Horu is meant to be a test of user skill its design is ignorant to the pacing preferences and time by which individuals take to complete a game of their own accord. Ori at this point says instead go hard or bust. I think I’m for the latter option."

It's visuals, score, and subtle story telling serve as an excellent draw to a demanding, precise, and incredibly rewarding platformer.As the game opens up, you start with a basic collection of platforming abilities, but over time the gameplay becomes rich with options. By the end, you are juggling nearly a dozen abilities to get through increasinly challenging levels, many with their own environmental mechanics that play off of your character's abilities rather cleverly. Driven  along by the game's stunning aesthetic and wonderful music, the came keeps all your senses occupied.There are some minor quirks to the gameplay. The control scheme could use some tweaking, or at least allow for customization. Some of the visual element, particularly the bloom and attack effects, tend to obscure the action a little too much, especially in combat. It's frustrating when you can't see enemy projectiles because the air between you and them is filled with blue energy.There are a few incredibly demanding, lengthy sequences that may not be to some players' liking. You will probably die a lot and the sequences, for those not especially good at platforming, can take a long time to complete, despite the actual sequence in full taking maybe a minute to complete. These sequences also tend to be very trial and error based, juxtaposed by a very easy to read level design philosophy throughout the normal areas of the game.My last issue with the game is probably my biggest. You cannot return to the game once you complete it. So if you want to 100% everything, do it when you get all the abilities from the trees. It's fairly easy and rewarding to find all of the hidden locations and orbs so I do recomend it.Overall, I found this game to be thouroughly enjoyable, gorgeous to look at, and extremely touching. I normally cannot stand 2D platformers, but the art and intro was enough to convince me to give it a try. I'm extremely glad I did and I've grown an appreciation for the genre that wasn't there before."

However, does that mean you should quit playing? Well the answer is simple! No you should not, the game has a lot of challenges, and those challenges are always fun to beat, even if you have to spend hours on it. BUT! There is more, the game has a great story line, that is also a rollercoaster, sometimes you will cry, sometimes you will smile and at the end of it, you stare at the screen and wish there were more or another game comming out! The game is great, and includes a lot of different factors that makes it sattisfying to play, such as having a nice and simplistic comebat, a cool skilltree, and did i mention the beautiful graphics and atmosphere? Well I probably did, but the game deserves a chance! Atleast that's my opinion!"

The HUD is about as minimal as possible in a game, and the gameplay mechanics are very easy to grasp.Ran into the issue of the abilities not displaying all the possibilities, which briefly got me stuck late-game. An early-game wall-to-wall jump proved irksome, requiring precision distance and landings. Couple glitches encountered when an enemy got stuck, and I fell through the floor, but only once each. For a squishy fellow, Ori fights pretty well.Had a blast with the abilities, and certainly enjoyed the climbing and Burst jumps. The world drew me in, and I desire to see more. I want to see more about the cultures, the environment, and Ori herself. Make a movie/series. :)I was impressed with the world's design. The developers used the immediate foreground and the background to GREAT effect, making the world feel more open, rather than a sidescroller. But seeing the terrain displayed in such a way made me want to climb everything, and go anywhere in full 3D controls.The one glaring issue I have witht he game would be the boss cinematic fights. While they were cleverly designed, the game does punish you for every mistake, and my wrist feels like hell because of it. It was easy to rack up near 100 deaths in the first and final boss fights as my hand locked up.All-in-all, I would certainly recommend this game. Short and sweet, but challenging. I am baffled that the top three people on the leaderboard cleared the game in 2 hours with 100% complete and ZERO deaths. I need to go back and play it with a controller next to see how it compares tot he keyboard and mouse."

You learn mechanics by simple going further and further. When you can't ""jump through"", then you need to do something else somewhere else first. World is very well design to use every ability of Ori (new or not), sometimes in very clever way.The hero and controlsYou can't dislike Ori as protagonist.

Then, close the web browser and think about all the time you just saved by not playing this game.Ori and the Blind Forest looked so promising at the start, but it slowly got worse and worse.The first 20 minutes of the game are absolutely astounding, but it goes downhill very quickly.I'm normally a fan of platformer games, but this one just didn't strike me as good.From the trailer, it looks like an amazing, fast-paced platforming + combat game, but in reality, its more like""Jump over this, push this lever, oh look now theres an enemy so you have to press X a lot of times""and repeat. It's a pretty slow game, and the combat is laughably easy. The storyline is also pretty unintriguing.I'm sorry for being one of the almost 300 negative reviews for this game, but I just didn't enjoy it."

My computer rarely crashes and for it to crash 3 times in an hour on the same game tells me it is more than likely the game.

It's powerful soundtrack, it's goregous art and atmosphere, it's simply the best looking game I've played all year. But is it as good as it looks?The Short Review - If you love video games with great atmosphere or hell, love video games, this is it. This is what you need to play.The game's story isn't as great as you'd wish for it to be, but it's emotional, moving, and heartfelt. Ori's journey carries him across the land of Nibel on the objective of restoring the lands and preventing the disastors caused by the game's main antagonist, Kuro. I won't spoil much from here, but the game's ending is probably the best part of the story.Ori and the Blind Forest isn't a super-long game, and that's fine. The overall level design and flow feels akin to your typical Metroidvania (Go through ""dungeons"", Collect new moves/abilities, find hidden power-ups/upgrade stuff), but it still feels refined and unique. Unlike your Simons and Samuses, Ori is very vulnerable. and his/her moveset (According to the developers Ori's gender is whatever you think it is. I guess.) reflects that. You don't have charge shots, or missles (Although you technichally do get a charge attack later). Ori's moves allow for fast traversal, solving platforming puzzles, and discovering hidden secrets. The game's combat isn't interesting nor is it horrible but it could be better. Fighting enemies can be a bit annoying sometimes but you'll be able to use your other moves to dispatch them quicker.I should note that I came in this game expecting it to be hard, which it is. However, it's not super brutal or anything. You'll get frustrated at a few moments in the game, and you'll probably die a lot. If you are very casual to video games, this one will seriously beat you up in every way possible (Toughen up them skills hmm).The game has light RPG elements as well. You can earn experience and get ability points for a skill tree. It's entirely optional although a few of the upgrades do make things a bit easier.Traversing through the game can few a bit like backtracking since you'll be going to areas you've been to before constantly, but it's not frustrating or annoying, thanks to the abilities given to make traversal fast and allow for you to reach secrets you couldn't reach before.Is there anything I don't like about the game? Well, the game doesn't allow you to continue playing after finishing it. Once you enter the final dungeon, there's no going back. This sucks because there are tons of collectables for players to achieve and in order to go back and get them, well you have to replay the entire game. That's pretty much all I have going against it. I'm also not a fan of the way you save in the game. You save in any safe spot, but it'll cost energy. That's fine, but this limit makes it really aggrevating because there is no auto-saving. If you die in a room and your last checkpoint was the start of the room, too bad. It's more of a nitpick then anything, since it's not that bad. You just need to be careful on when you save.Ori and the Blind Forest is a fantastic gem of a game that you have to play. It's a powerful game with fantastic music and visuals. The game mechanics are solid (Although very, very familiar) and Ori's moveset is a perfect fit for the character and the game's platforming."

,Not Recommended,261570,19327729,"Posted: 27 November, 2015",all,Sayyiduna,"I really didn't want to give this a negative review, but cannot justify recommending this without some clearly defined caveats. It seems many steam reviews have at most 2 hours clocked, and if you were to ask me during that period if I recommend the game it would be an unqualified yes. Things change by mid-game though.The game's artwork is absolutely majestic, and watching the game is like watching a painting in motion. The praise continues to the characters and minimal setup for the ""story"" which is conveyed exceptionally well in the first few scenes.However, the high quality of the first few moments does not hold up in the game's design and especially the difficulty level.DIFFICULTY is the main factor for the negative review.It's a brutally unforgiving game requiring pixel-perfect jumping and timing. This is one of the few games I've played recently when my hands have cramped up and hurt terribly after game sessions on the gamepad. Attempting to play for anything more than 30 minutes at a time is a recipe for controller-throwing frustration.Enemy placement seems deliberately cruel where enemy behavior and firing arcs are very unpredictable. It's not uncommon to go through a very tough, difficult platforming areas only to be blinked out of existence in a fraction of a second by a powerful enemy. This is compounded by the fact that many enemies are tedious or, in some portions, impossible to kill.And you will be blinked out of existence very, very often. Although health and attack upgrades are available, enemies remain difficult to kill and will usually take 65-75% of your health in a single hit. Most enemies are also ranged and leave behind explosive ""residue"" which makes platforming sections with enemies extremely unforgiving. You can technically save anywhere, but this costs valuable energy and many sections are designed to not give you a ""break"" to do so.The platforming sections require immaculate timing, and after the mid-game, many of them rely on your ability to ""jump"" off of fired enemy projectiles. However, because enemies fire unpredictably, you will VERY frequently failed and instantly get killed by spikes whilst waiting for an enemy to fire a projectile right where you need to jump. As the game wears on, these sections get more elaborate and more ""random"" in the sense that you just have to hope this time the stars align and enemies fire where you need to go.So the main qualifier is this, when considering whether you should buy Ori. Are you an exceptionally patient gamer willing to deal with extremely infuriating platforming? Are you okay with losing again and again not because you aren't skilled but simply because the game, at that moment, didn't reward you with a favorable situation?Personally, I would recommend buying Rayman Legends, it's a far higher quality game with amazing artwork and gameplay that won't cause you to pop an aneurysm."

Entire areas of the map are made permanently inaccessible without warning, which undercuts the joy of exploration and completion that usually accompanies this kind of exploration-based title.Even more annoying are the timed chase sequences (reminiscent of Metroid's self-destruct escape sequences). Rather than a satisying test of player skill, these trial-and-error death traps instead throw you into entirely new areas and proceed to throw a dizzying array of one-hit-kill hazards at you. What should be tense, skill-based escape runs quickly turn into frustrating and cheap killzones, robbing these sequences of any kind of enjoyment.A number of bugged and inaccessible achievements round out my frustrations with this game.Ori should be a game you're proud to finish.

The only fun i had was in the escape sections. The story was trying to tearjerk me over and over, the musical score is quite nice but the game has two serious problems. Firstly in my case getting about the map had alot of backtracking, you have to find a different route to the same objective which would be ok if the enemies werent so horribly tedious to deal with. That coupled with them having too much hp makes getting round the map a chore, its honestly better to jump over and run through enemies as you lose alot dueling them. But you are forced to fight those green ♥♥♥♥ing cannon frogs.The powers and leveling aren't anything new either, maybe im bias because i played nihilumbra the day before, but that game offers new mechanics, is not overly long and has engaging thought provoking puzzles, unlike this.

If you're looking for a Metroidvania, this barely qualifies.While the art is phenomenal, and the puzzle platformer elements are decent, the game design is amateur at best, and the handling is often times rather floaty.Ultimately what you get is an almost completely linear game with some backtracking just to grab stuff with new abilities, intersparsed with meaningless combat and insufferable chase sequences.As a game, 7.5/10.  There are many flash games that would give it a run for its money in terms of content, controls, and enjoyment, but the entire package does a lot to show what video games are capable of as a matter of artistic elements, in that category it is superb.  For the money, it's decent value, though it has almost no replayability, but it's probably worth experiencing if you don't mind a 5 hour experience.As far as anyone complaining about the save system, or this game being hard, they're just bad at platforming.  Took me about 4 hours to beat without ever really getting stuck.That said, bugs could screw you over.

This is a big no-no.--Secondly, while I appreciate the devs taking some risks and giving the player some unusual skill combinations, the Stomp skill is by far the WORST implementation of controls in any platformer. Accidentally hitting 'down' will send your character plummeting usually into a spike pit to their death.--Another problem that games with lots of beautiful effects have is sometimes the screen gets too mulled by craziness to tell what is going on. Ori suffers from this, as well, when the spirit flame attack pretty much obstructs any enemy wind-ups; and there is a dodge/reflect mechanic that hinges on this ability to see incoming attacks.--The temple escape scenes are all WRETCHED. Often times, the player will die a good few dozen times because it's unclear what is killing them or there are just tons of instant death elements that will ambigously kill the player. If you're really lucky, things that will hurt/kill you one moment you will need to use the dodge-bash mechanic on seconds later - BEST SCENARIO PLANNING EVAR (sarcasm). Especially in the case of the first dungeon, beat the rising water...except the water auto-rises in certain parts. So, no matter how well you are doing, the water is just going to raise to a certain mark once you reach a particular area and likely screw up any platforming you may have gotten a leg-up on by doing well. Why punish the player for excelling in your game?All in all, I feel you'd have to be a special sort of masochist to play through and enjoy Ori for what it is. I feel like they wanted to make a Lilo and Stitch meets Fern Gully animation, but decided to milk the gaming realm for cash instead. It has a pretty style, but also is a pretty bad game.Final edit - made it through to the end. It was not fun, mostly sloppy controls (can't exclusively use the D-pad due to the bash skill requiring the precision of the joystick during many jumping puzzles), and intentionally frustrating in the liberal use of instant death scenery that is ambiguously harmful to the player. I wish this team had hired a veteran game designer so these glaring errors wouldn't have made it into the final product. I'm glad my initial impressions were correct. Don't buy this garbage, although it is very pretty garbage."

I thikn the whole story and beauty aspects of the game are overrated. Specially the beginning of the game feels slow and pointless.- It's one of those games, where you do the same exact thing 5 times, and Ori will never react in the same way. If your concept of difficulty is based on unreliable controls, then your game isn't actually difficult. I mean, this isn't Rayman Legends or Rayman Origins difficult (speed, reflexes, etc.). This is original Tomb Raider difficult (pressing jump 10 times in the same way at the same exact place to get 10 different reactions from the game).- Similar to the controls, several enemies and parts of the level design are cheap so you're bound to fail and keep trying until the stars are aligned in your favor.- The talents system is tedious.- So is the music.Currently it's at a 5€ price. At that price get it by all means, but if it's more expensive, don't blindly believe the hype and research a bit on what you're getting for your money."

Some of the missions (For example escaping from the water fall) is almost impossible with no checkpoints. You will be spending days trying to jump over things that will kill you while fighting enemy spawns (you need those because you have to bounce off their bullets to jump higher) and escaping from the waterfall which moves faster than light speed.This is the problem with this game: The better you play the more challenging the game becomes. The AI is designed to punish the good players for playing well. I tested this in multiple occasions and if I play very lousy then the AI slows down but the second my timing improves the AI gets really aggressive and everything just picks up to kill you.Stay away from this game and pick it up when it is on sale for 0.99 cents. I feel bad for the artist and the musician who created a masterpiece here only to be ruined by some clowns who had no idea what they were doing. The QA team of this game must have been on ecstasy when the tested it.This was my original review just in case:""Excellent platformer but it lacks a bit of hints in certain areas. Sometimes the game makes you wonder if you are just stuck or there is a certain skill you need to unlock to get passed the area.

You have a couple abilties which can be used to defeat different enemies.  The enemies are cute and generally enjoyable.  However, the entirety of combat is unsatisfying.  There are no real boss battles.  Combat, and enemies as a whole, are there to either interfere with your platforming needs (e.g., jumping from platform to platform) or to facilitate your platforming needs (e.g., using your skill to use their projectiles to jump to the next platform).  Aside from these two ""features,"" there's no need for enemies to exist in this game.  The real ""enemy"" is your environment, replete with one-shot-kills.The gameplay is responsive, interesting, and verstile.  Your character feels nimble, agile, and responsive.  It's completely enjoyable to move around in the world.  But, my *biggest* issue is that this game turns into (devolves into?) a Super Meat Boy clone in many ways.  Heck, there's even a SMB easter egg.  You have a life bar--you can get something like 15 life bars/points, but for much of the game the amount is entirely pointless.  The game is replete--chock-full to bursting--with one-shot-kills.  The first time you face certain obstacles, it's impossible to know if it will damage you or kill you outright.  Some spikes are insta-kill; some are not.  Same for lava.  Same for a thousand other things.  Eventually, you can force-save enough that it becomes merely a tedious process of learning the right patterns and timing for button presses, but that also leads to impatience which leads to more untimely deaths.  That says nothing about the three gauntlets the game has.  Many people complain about the first gauntlet, and I agree, that has to be the absolute worst.  It will crush casual players.  The third gauntlet isn't much better, though.  There is some serious challenge here; this isn't a game for the casual player.If you're a hardcore, SMB platforming fan, go for it.  If you're looking for a good story and/or a casual game, maybe try for something else.  If you're a fan of the soundtrack, buy it separately."

It's decent, but has some nasty annoyances.I'll start with the positive, beautiful game, great soundtrack. Only slightly innovative, but hey, it's a popular genre, so there's not that much new to be made.So, why the thumbs down? Simply put, this game does some of the carnal sins of a metroidvania.1: excessive backtracking that feels like a chore.2: extremely large degree of ""hey, new mechanic, now do only this for the next 15 minutes3: bad combat. Button spamming is a must, and it should never be a must. It feels tacked on.4: the resource management of making savepoints is tiring.5: as you save with current HP, you also risk getting stuck if you're careless, and it essentially boils down to respawning over and over until you've gotten through a segment with good enough HP to save.6: very long platforming segments that are very unforgiving, and no autosave, making you die over and over from the start.7: makes very poor use of the ""you can now open door type X"" mechanic that metroidvanias are famous for. You essentially complete 80-90% of a zone the first time you pass through, and some areas are one time only.8: seriously, why the hell does this game not have fast travel between spirit points? THEY'RE PERFECT FOR THE ROLE!The thing that annoys me is that with perhaps an extra 3 months of development, they could have fixed so much of this. As it stands now, I'd give it 5/10, and that's mostly the aesthetics. Maybe they'll rework it for the definitive edition? I sure hope so, because there's a really good game underneath, it just needs some adjustment and polishing on the gameplay end."

The gameplay is too slow, I always felt like I needed a Run button. The double jump doesn't have any vertical height, the fights are boring you just have to mash X and move a little to avoid the ennemy attack. The bestiary is limited, there is a lot of color swap.I hated how the character kept hanging on the wall even though I tried to move to the other direction.But the absolute WORST were the levels where you depend on the ennemy to continue. I don't want to spoil it, but be prepared to die because the ennemy hasn't seen you even though you did everything right.Also, there is a lot of FX in the game, it looks pretty good but I also died a lot because it was very very difficult to distinguish the ennemy attack from the rest. (explosion, fog, Ori's attack etc)The backtracking is obnoxious when you have to go way back, I wish we could teleport on the saves altars, and sometimes on the way you die and you forgot to save, then you cry because you have to do it again.The difficulty is not well balanced, most of the game is very easy and then you can have a place where you will die 10/15 times. There will be traps that you cannot avoid if you don't know them too, it can be annoying when you try not to die ( the game shows the number of death, so you'll naturally want to have the less possible).To be honest I wouldn't recommend nor recommend it, but it's just my way of getting back at it."

Here's where your extra 10+ hours will be spent:- Saving is not allowed unless you are on firm ground. So get ready for a flawless combination every time you approach floating/flying platforms.- Boss fights of this game are quick escapes. Single mistake in a row of about 50 moves gets you killed. And you can not save again.I have about 15 hours of gameplay and over 1300 spawns. This indicates a clear issue. I've two decades of gameplaying experience, I'm not that bad (a slight process of getting old might be interfering, though). Most of these are instant deaths over reckless moves that come with loss of patience and interest. Quick escapes have impressive atmosphere but it's just a scripted, long route. I'm writing this after an exhausting trial of escaping the last part and I'm not sure if I'm going to try again and finish it.It's of course great to have a challenging game. I believe I share a distaste of overly arcade games that don't leave the player for a second without throwing hints with countless fellow gamers here, but the difficulty of this game is not in the most pleasant way.Sure you need excellent vigilance if you are training for pilot certification, or you should practice really hard not to miss a single note in a tough song.

There are almost no areas that can be cleared on the first or even the fifth try, because in most cases any given 'challenge section' is many screens wide. And just for icing, for those trying to be completionist, there are many hidden areas and items in places you can't return to, but appear inaccessible unless you figure out the stunt. Each save slot is a single playthrough, so you cannot back up to an area that has been closed by game events without doing the whole game over.Additionally, very early in the game, you acquire the ability to jump off of enemies and enemy projectiles, and about as soon as this happens the gameplay changes to basically force you to try to avoid killing enemies as you have to use this to progress. Unfortunately, enemy firing arcs are fairly random and due to the aforementioned need for pixel perfect jumping, a lot the repetition you experience won't be because you did anything wrong, but just because the enemy shot at the wrong angle that time. What could have been an interesting and unique mechanic instead becomes a frustrating exercise in randomness, as this can kill you anytime from the beginning of a sequence to just short of the first safe platform in minutes.To top it off, the health bar is basically meaningless, as almost nothing actually deals only one point of damage and most terrain obstacles can instagib, the leveling tree is arranged such that you basically have to level everything at once so there is no real choice, and the save anywhere system is negated by level design and a need to use the same resource to clear many areas, meaning it is quite possible to put yourself in a situation where your having saved means you cannot clear the area and have to start the game over again.What this means is that you will spend hours not experiencing the beautiful story, not experiencing the excellent graphics, and not experiencing the incredible music, but doing the same platforming challenges over and over and over until you want to scream at your computer. Hard can be fun, dieing can be part of the experience, but not to the extent that this game requires. Only a masochist should purchase this game."

It's a beautiful atmospheric and interesting game, but I do not want anyone to experience the rage that this game induces with certain parts in the game.---The creators obviously put a LOT of time and effort into creating an amazing atmosphere with the music and art they used. Which is why I don't understand why they chose to insert parts into the game you are meant to play through trial and error. A lot of trial and error. A lot of dying because you are quickly and repetitively confronted with 1 hit-game over objects being thrown at you in random sequences. To avoid those objects you are sometimes dependant on random factors outside of your control. This is what causes frustration, anger and ultimately rage. It completely destroys the well crafted atmosphere of the game.I think they should have made an easy and hard difficulty mode. Put all the frustrating ""die 100 times minimum before you understand how to respond to this sequence of events"" in the hard difficulty mode.  Let us noobs enjoy the story and atmosphere! At times I felt like I was in one of Ross' Mario Maker levels. Unfairly difficult with no checkpoints in between.Game length/replayability:My first (and only) clear took 440 deaths and 9,5 hours, I reached 97% completion without too much trouble. It put me on the 88000-89000 rank range on the global leaderboards. I assume the remaining 3% are things I should have picked up during the rage inducing escape-sequences. I was dying enough without going the extra mile. There is no new-game+ feature. So unless you want to get 100% completion and/or compete with others on the leaderboards you are done after your first clear.I would not recommend this game because while beautiful, atmospheric and interesting to play, I would never wish the rage that this game induces on anyone."

Quite fitting for an immersive experience.The art direction is very reminscent of a Hayao Miyazaki Film.The Neutral:(See Below for reasons)The Save system is both a boon and bane to the player.The platforming is decent and the controls responsive for the most part.The Bad:(See Below for reasons)Player skill during the First Dungeon Escape segment is negatively rewarded.Platforming falls apart in the second dungeon, resulting in a ton of needless deaths.Comments:I love everything about this game. It's got a great visual appeal and style, very reminiscent of works from Hayao Miyazaki. It's soundtrack is gorgeous and has decent sound work in regards to the ambient and player avatar noises. It's platforming is decent, not stellar however not bad to say the least.So what really drove the first nail in the coffin with this game for me was the running segment from the first dungeon, where the dungeon is rapidly filling with water. The design ""Blue Shells"" itself with the Water rubberbanding, which basically means ""the better you are; the faster the water rises"". It  kills any real feeling of accomplishment of being good platforming or knowing the path to take. I understand that the segment is supposed to build tension and a sense of imminent danger, but it's annoying when player skill is negatively returned. Still, I got through that segment of the game around my fifth or so try (Death Counter: 20) and made it through all the way to the second dungeon.The second dungeon drove the second nail in the coffin. The segments where you have to carry an orb around and be affected by the direction of gravity is going is really finicky. Sometimes it's difficult to jump off of an inverted platform on to another, just because the game rigidly sticks you to a platform, due to the orbs weight. Giving the player the use of the already obtained double jump in this section would of helped, but it's disabled for reasons. Not to mention there are some serious blind jumps in this section, which makes it even more annoying as there's instant death pits everywhere. So it's a ton of trial and error along with clunky mechanics.The final nail was the save system, it works in some respects but it's really counter-intuitive in others. I understand the backups and all that for those aiming for a ""No Death Run"" which is nice for those people. However, sometimes the game just decides to not backup a save for some unknown reason. Maybe there's something hidden I don't know about, but it really annoyed me in the second dungeon where I was using a back-up save at the beginning of the dungeon due to my primary save being bugged (No Orb on load) and not being overwritten properly. As soon as I saved again, it wouldn't overwrite my previous primary save and wouldn't back-up my current save due to some arbitrary limitations. I basically quit after this point (Death counter: 20), deleted my save and put the game down.To wrap this up, Ori is a wonderful experience for what I had with it, but poor design decisions and some really wonky systems really made it a chore to play effectively. I might give it another go in a year or so, but currently it has left me miffed and unwilling to give it a second chance."

When you stick it, it feels awesome, but that happens once out of ten attempts.  Most of the other nine are wondering how you missed the wall, why you didn't jump at all despite hitting the button, or what the hitbox on that all-too-cleverly-grown spike plant really is.Falling is a life-or-death gamble.  Maybe you'll land on spikes you can't see yet.  Maybe you won't.  But you have to drop down, and the leap is always one of faith.  While I appreciate high-difficulty games, there comes a point where it feels less like your fault and more like the game's own gimmicks.  Sometimes, the foreground art will cover enemies and their projectiles.  Regardless of how accurate or immersing that is, it's not fun for the player.Save system feels really weird.  Half the upgrades on one tree of abilities affect your save spots.  I'm sure many will say this is brilliant, new innovation for the character; I think it's silly.  Of all the things you want to get consistent about an adventure game, the save system is debatably at the top of the list.  But it's far from constant in Ori, namely because you can put down your own save spots wherever you want.  Permanent and free save points are very few and far between.  If you don't have the energy for a new one of your own, you're out of luck.  And heaven forbid you unknowingly place a new save spot right before a cutscene and instant death.Gameplay is beholden to the aesthetics and plot.  I haven't found a way to bypass certain cutscenes.  You get stopped frequently so the game can explain something to you.  If it's supposed to be more engaging, it actually just detracts from my experience.Graphics are pretty and soundtrack is very good.  I'm not a major fan of either, but I absolutely respect how much effort and talent went into the authentic sounds and polished visuals.  And when you play the game the way the devs meant you to play it to further the story, it feels great.I can't overlook the flaws I see, however.  There are enough, and they are annoying enough, to keep me from wanting to play more."

I don't mind difficulty when it fits the game, but this isn't Super Meat Boy.

The art style is really good, the controls are adequate (once you get used to them being ""floaty"") and the story is surreal/engaging.  The game is difficult in some places, but balanced.  I died many times, but eventually got the hang of saving at strategic locations.  I wasn't frustrated, but definitely challenged.Then, I hit the cliff of stupidity shown in the video.  After beating my head against this section.  I found the video and saw that I had made my way most of the way through.  But had no desire to try to make it to the top of the Gonzo Tree.This section of the game is ridiculous because it suddenly introduces a timed component.  The only way to proceed is by memorizing timed jumps.  And if you miss one of those timed jumps, you're swallowed by the bile of the Gishna tree.  It's like I was playing Outland and was suddenly transported to Super Meat Boy (either of which are better platformers).  I was totally frustrated and it completely changed my opinion of the game.Could I spend another 30 minutes memorizing jump patterns?  Sure, but why?

It turns out after the initial tutorial section, the game shows its true colours. Under all its flashiness, it's just another one of those ""trial-and-error"" games.Huge sections of the game force you into a constant rinse-and-repeat cycle. You get punished for not knowing how to advance until you fail and die (and you will) therefore experiencing it. To make matters more frustrating, the save system plays on this fact, asking the player to save manually but only when the game decides its okay for you to do so. I'm sorry but my free time is sparse and I don't want to be wasting it replaying the same sections until I ""perfect"" it. It's a shame that a huge chunk of the game the developers spent sweating over will now be left unseen due this bad decision.The game will gradually give you abilities as the game progresses asking you to revisit parts of the map you have not yet fully explored. This in itself is a fine but for some reason the developers chose to block off certain areas of the game mid-way though the story without notice. Why do this if you're asking the player to revisit parts the map with their new abilities? So another bad design choice has stopped me enjoying the game and hunting down my 100%. Suppose this is to re-enforce the ""rinse and repeat"" mechanic they've stuck by?It's ok to pay homage a game from the early 90's but at least take the best parts and learn from what they did wrong. I honestly thought we were past this annoying gameplay trope. If you like these type of games where you like being repeatily frustrated by bad design choices then go for it.

You have to tech in all ability trees simultaniously to even stand a chance at progression so you can't really specialise in anything.  There are so many areas which you can't reach even in the starting zones,  like 2-3 hours worth of gameplay, until the late game.  You have to backtrack constantly and enemies respawn over and over.

The other time I had to climb awkwardly up a 90 degree wall to get myself up.Also feel likethistheme was repeated too many times. Otherwise it was just ambient music that added little to the music.

This game didn't find a good balance between gameplay and atmosphere. It feels like one team worked on each thing, and didn't really work together. It's hard to explain, but it just felt... weird. It might just be me being picky. One of the highlights of the game gameplay-wise was jumping around with the dash ability, dodging attacks and re-directing them. Sadly, this game too late into the game, and it's the only fun upgrade. The others are climbing vertically and using a strong AoE attack which you will never use, amongst other abilities you only have to use to advance in the game. In other words, there are few you'll actually use other than to complete the game.IMO, the only positive thing this game has is the atmosphere, but even that's not enough for some people.I would recommend metroid games if you want to play a metroidvania.

As Ori you clammer through maze-like environments with tight controls, avoid enemies (or fight them), and use new abilities to traverse the world. You also find shiny things of varying importance which can appeal to the hoarder kind of player mixed with a hefty lump of rote memory button checks.Ori's main schtick, besides being very very pretty, is that you can save anywhere. As long as it happens to be on flat ground, not during a boss fight, not near enemies, not during a button check procedures, and you have enough resources. In others word save states with asterisks. Nothing to write home about, but an idea I don't see pop up too often.When you're not playing cram school with your button checks, Ori and the Blind Forest is of medium difficulty. Most areas have tricky jumps and trigger fast use of abilities. But nothing makes you stop and think or use abilities in novel ways- its just a lazy follow the pattern or die play through. Makes me wonder why there is health at all- as taking multiple hits rarely comes into play. Players who have enjoyed a ton of sidescrollers will find nothing new, find the not-so-secret secrets, and breeze through the puzzle. New players will be treated to 30 odd years of culminated but standard side scrolling know-how.Ori and Blind Forest is conflicted when it comes to play and aesthetic. Unless you force yourself to slowdown, you may completely miss the beauty of the game- which I believe to be THE selling point of the game. Ori has stunning artwork. I know I've repeated myself many times, but its an absolute treat for the eyes. Sometimes, its kind of downer that the game is so focused on dashing, jumping, and ricocheting through the stages that you never have a chance to absorb where you are. In some sense, I felt like the game may of benefited from a simpler aesthetic. Its got a “run through this stage quickly” feel with a “stay awhile and gawk” look.Ori and the Blind Forest has a paper thin narrative. Ori does all this running, jumping, and murdering because “nature is dieing because a magic shiny thing was stolen”. Ori just so happens to be lost portion of a big tree's life-substaining magic, and without Ori the forest just doesn't work. The story isn't important, its all about the game play. Beyond the intro and the ending, there are no tender or beautiful moments you might expect from the trailer. You can take the levels, characters, abilities and give them a new coat of paint and it would be all the same. This is perhaps Ori and Blind Forest's biggest downfall- it looks unique but plays generic. If being a forest spirit is pretty darn special, then develop a game to play to that experience. Make me feel like I'm a glowy forest spirit, not an accessory robot with homing lasers, jet boots, and an upgrade kit.Ori may be nothing new, but it has what you expect from a sidescroller for 20 USD. Its average in my book. Younger players or players new to sidescrollers will have a solid entry into the genre. If you want a lighter exploration experience of the Metroid series mixed with Volgarr the Viking or Super Meat Boy memory-based gameplay, you'll find Ori and the Blind Forest to be an addition to your collection or at least a decent hold-over game until the next big side scrolling adventure comes along. If you're like me and have an absolute need for new, fun, challenging, or innovative sidescrollers, Ori and Blind Forest is unsatisfying because you've played it all before."

How not o be uncharitable with your game. It's almost spiteful in its design. I don't beleive i'm even saying this - this game has some of the best art and environement design you'll ever see in a 2D game. But it's also purposefully toying with you.I guess if you had to comparte this game to a person, this would be that rich kid with all the toys, and he'll only let you play if you do what he says, exactly what he says. If you don't, he'll put you in a cage, until you do what he says. I'd rather play with my other friend, Dark Souls - he's dirty and messed up, eats out of the dirt, but at least he's honest and lets you do things your way.5 out of 10 adulthoods - play it if you enjoy snarky games.

Arguably the most beautiful 2D platformer you've ever played Ori and the Blind Forest stuns with details -- swaying plants, perfect mood lighting, a veritable army of colors on screen at any given moment. How visually stunning this game is can't be stated enough. It's like having your eyes injected with unicorns on LSD. The story is simple, well told, and emotionally effective. The gameplay is more or less spot on with the occasional erratic control flub. Combat is basic but fun. Secrets are numerous and sometimes rather clever. You're likely to die often, but generally this isn't a problem as you're able to consume energy to establish a ""spirit link"" to save when you like - almost always. The skill tree is basic but useful though by game's end you're likely to have all trees near maxed if not fully completed.Ori's problem is that every point that makes it succeed to brilliantly is completely thrown out the window in the sequences after waking a spirit element. The screen floods with effects making it hard to figure out where to go, what to do, and where Ori is admist the chaos. You've overcome with instances of one-hit kills exacerbated by occasionally buggy game elements (primary the dash n' bash targets) that cause you to die. And, worst of all, the save-as-you-go establishment is tossed aside in favor of you repeating these gaunlets over and over and over again from the very beginning until you can execute them flawlessly. What should be dramatic life or death struggles against a tide of chaos degenerate into an absolutely infuriating experience that fails the player on every level. Your reward for completing these is a save file with a shiny icon and the inability to load your completed game. Did you want to explore the world or maybe trek back to nab a secret or two you might have missed? Too ♥♥♥♥ing bad -- play the game from the start again. A great big middle finger in your face.As much as I'd would love to recommend Ori and the Blind Forest these details deride the entire experience leaving a foul taste in the mouth by game's end.

The relaxtion I'd hoped for? I always ended my gameplay tensed up. Ori is entirely trial and error style game play, but set in a lush visual world.

This could have been a really memorable game: dreamy music, fantastic artwork, a good balance of detail and flow in storytelling etc... But it is one of only a hand full of games I have rage quitted in like 25 years of gaming. It is not impossible but seriously... spending several hours on an escape sequence just kills the joy. What is the point they are trying to make? If it is that you need to gain the skill to pass it, here is my answer: half way through the sequence there is completely random chance of certain projectiles being at a certain place which you need for escaping. you go through the brutally difficult process of getting there and without a chance to save, you have to start over. I died hundreds of times in a few hours of playing the game. I am not a professional gamer, but hey, I am not really THAT bad. And my experience with platformers goes back to the 8 bit era so yes, I can handle difficulty. This is not difficult. It is broken. Here is why: When you are making a game you should not think your audience are going to play it on your machine with your skills with your joypad/keyboard/mouse. People have different skills and different hardware. When something gets to this level of difficulty, miliseconds of reaction time from your hardware start to become a thing. And that is what makes the whole experience change. That, plus: When I have to repeat a task times and times for a chance of something happening, it very much resembles the repeated killing of the same monster for a chance to get a rare loot. We all openly criticize MMORPG games for forcing us to grind. They just do it to add to hours of our gameplay. Why is Ori and the Blind Forest doing it? I couldn't find any answer.I believe this and I stand by my statement: It could have been a great game. But it is broken because the difficulty is 1. not justified. 2. not adjustable. Add the fact that controls are not customizable and you have a game which could have been great but fails just because its gameplay fails."

But ultimately it's not much more than a really good example of the genre, and doesn't break enough new ground or tell a story unique or compelling enough to be quite as lauded as it is. The plot is more than a little lacking and the story and presentation are manipulative. You almost certainly won't mind as much as I did, so buy it and play it if you like this kind of game even a little bit.-This is a very, very good Metroidvania game. It isn't pioneering anything in terms of gameplay, but it's absolutely beautiful visually, and well-programmed with minimal CPU/GPU burdens for what it accomplishes. The framerate stayed at a basically constant 60fps, discounting occasional drops when loading a new area. I really enjoyed the statistics it makes available on the pause screen, which many games would do well to implement. I think this game does ultimately deserve the most praise for its visuals and soundtrack, which are both breathtaking. It really represents what I wanted to see done with 2D graphics as a kid watching microprocessors grow steadily stronger, before everyone got obsessed with polygons and 3D acceleration, which looked like garbage back then. Some of the tracks from the soundtrack reminded me of the Square classic Xenogears, which is extraordinarily high praise.My issues, which I'm certain almost nobody reading this will share with me but I think they're worth mentioning, lie with the story and presentation. This is a pretty cutesy game, all things considered, and Ori is a cute little guy. However, it's mainly his personality that shines through the gameplay that makes him likeable, for me at least. On first glance; sure, he's adorable, but it feels calculated. As though his character was designed not so much to reflect any attributes or functions endemic to the character or species we come to find he is part of, as to evoke as many disarming adorable things as possible, from puppies to monkeys to foxes. His blinding white coloration gives him a sense of purity and innocence. That part would work out great if this story stuck to the coming-of-age narrative it should. It's a quality that his closest relative in terms of design inspiration, the manic, bestial alien Stitch from the excellent Lilo and Stitch, a far more interesting character than Ori, certainly did not have.I felt like I was being manipulated by a marketing department when I first saw Ori, rather than presented with a character. He started to win me over when I started playing the actual game; I could see his personality coming through in his movements. I first noticed that he takes an extra little flip on every third jump you perform, apropos of nothing, seemingly, apart from a simple joy at being alive and moving. It made me smile. I think I finally came around to his side around the time swimming becomes available, smiling at seeing him swim upside down for a few carefree moments before turning the right way up, and the slight intake of breath when he surfaces. I drowned him a few times of course, as we're required to do in games with swimming. But I liked him, okay? Just not because of his calculated cuteness.Naru is a different story. I found her immediately reminiscent of No-Face from Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away, only with not even an ounce of that character's personality, likeability, and awkward sweetness. Even when he does horrible things, you feel sorry for him, because he's just an innocent. Again, in a calculated effort to increase the cuteness factor by as many quantifiable percentage points as possible, she was made both furry and roly-poly. I didn't care. Her death had pretty much no effect on me. Eventually, as I came to like Ori, I cared because of the effects on him. It has even less effect when you shove in an 11th-hour reversal to avoid making anybody sad, I guess, or giving Ori any kind of arc or really point to his journey beyond just beating the game. Keeping Naru dead could have set up a really excellent ending, as well. And if this really was a Studio Ghibli story, Naru would have been dead and buried.But here's the thing; this is NOT a story about a parents' relationship with a child, it's simply what bookends it, and what informs its ending. What this game actually does is tell the story of a young, innocent naif learning to cope with and face the challenges of a big, frightening world following the tragic death of the only caretaker he's ever known. To reverse that death in the end totally robs the plot of all of its significance.Maybe this reveals that I'm a psychopath, but the character I identified with most was the great owl Kuro, who lost her children to an impersonal force of nature we're for some reason expected to represent, although he randomly chooses not to save the young owls even though there's little reason to think he's incapable of doing so. What more identifiable representation of being human in a universe with either a nonexistent or uncaring God can there be? I'm alright with Kuro's sacrifice in the ending, which is the only thing about it that made me feel anything at all. But the ending should have been Ori and Kuro's last child, ready to take on the world together. Don't crowd things in your simple little coming-of-age story.But despite the story completely undermining itself, and Naru being a total flatline for me emotionally, this is a very, very fun Metroidvania with a cute protagonist and a nice ending that will probably make you feel really good because you're not a black-hearted old man like me.GO FORTH AND PLAY IT"

Plenty of unlocks that will keep you backtracking to see if you can get through a passage you've had to ignore previously for a secret or such.And the art... the art is simply gorgeous.However...The game isn't quite ""completionist"" friendly. You will be locked out of certain sections of the game map once you've passed through them the first time. Missed an secret? Too bad - no 100% score. You also can't manually handle savegames, so you're very likely to have to replay the game at least once to get a perfect score. (See next paragraph for workaround)More importantly the game will gladly let you become completely stuck in certain parts of the game with no way of getting out (Yes, really). If you don't do certain puzzles in the correct order, you will quickly realize that you're completely stuck with no way out... except for a very helpful teleportation tool by a clever modder (Which will also let you re-visit locked areas for a completionist run)So surely these things can be fixed? Maybe ... But the developers have had almost a year to do so by this point, and considering the ""Microsoft Studios"" label, allowing the player to get permanently stuck (without realizing at first) is simply unacceptable.TLDR; 100% Runs are hard since you can accidentally skip secrets permanently.You will get permanently stuck if certain puzzles are not done in proper order.Only workaround is to use teleport hack tool."

If you are looking for several hours of great atmosphere on a metroidvainia styled map, this is the game you wanna check out.But there are two things I just can't stand about it:The cringeworthy intro: In the beginning OatBF kills off a character the player has zero attachment to, in a pseudo dramatic way, which was pretty meh to be honest.Aside from that, there is this compromise between a hard difficulty and being an absolutely mainstream jump 'n Run for the entire family. You can literally save your game after every jump, every enemy, every small puzzle and you will never run out of save points, ever. For this game to be somewhat challenging, you'd have to ""make up"" your own rules, limit your save points or go for 100% achievements (which is pretty darn gosh challenging tbh but I couldn't care less).This whole save where you want mechanic takes away so much of what Ori could have been, that I just cannot recommend it for what it is.If Ori had a normal and a hard-mode I'd recommend the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game, but with only this few segments with limited save points, there is just no need to learn from mistakes and that's just sad./edit: So, I feel like writing some more, so here is another point that was kind of a letdown gameplaywise:The combat. It works, it's alright, it does it's job and looks freaking gorgeous. But sadly it lacks depth and precision. Just like every single gameplay aspect in Ori, it is a compromise, nothing more, nothing less. And here is how combat in Ori works: Stand near an enemy and mash the attack button. Auto aiming does the rest. Later on you are able to reflect enemy bullets and that is as deep as it gets gameplaywise.Trying to appeal to every kind of player is just the wrong way to go.@the guy with the private profile in the comments: this is exactly what I did good sir."

And the floatiest controls of any game I have played.The character is meant to be some sort of super agile squirrel spirit - but it floats through the air in interminable jump animations, during which there is no ability to steer. The mechanics of this might involve some kind of obscure 'aftertouch' to do with how long you hold the button down before releasing it controlling how high you jump - but gosh darn it I just want to jump on two simple platforms and go up a tree, not master a radical new control system.At least that's what I think they were getting at in one line of the ""emotive"" deliberately broken-English tutorial voiceover - which during the first few stages are on a par with Papo&Yo for laying it on thick. These voiceovers are delivered by a sort of floating battery that has to be recharged whenever you save. Whatever.The dire controls are like what would happen if you took Sonic the Hedgehog and how he runs and jumps... and put him into the tightly packed levels and dodgy hitboxes and glitchy controls and utterly unforgiving environmental obstacles of... Manic Miner.I bought this because I thought the story would appeal to my toddler. But my toddler wouldn't have had much opportunity to wander round the environment and watch squirrel-thingy gathering fruit with Totoro No-Face, before having to do a jumping-over-timed-fireballs skit whose three, just three, platforms are equivalent in difficulty to the entire last stage of Trine. Wall jumps consist of inching up a wall in small random jerks and then hoping you manage to pull the other way during the split-second in which the character can receive a control of any kind, and that at the same time the incoming fireball happens to be somewhere else. On landing safely, it's usually necessary to use one of the oh-so-post-console portable savepoints. These are in short supply and use up the same talking-battery-narrator energy needed to open half the doors.Since you play the ghost of a departed squirrel who might also be a leaf from a mystic tree (cringe), maybe they could have had insta-respawning instead of this agony. I also wondered if perhaps I had done something wrong in the pretend-interactive opening sequence and Totoro No-Face was supposed to survive and throw me past literally every single platform segment."

You run around a corrupted forest restoring it by fixing the elemental altars and fighting whatever is not you.The platforming is great, and the dashing mechanic (which is called a bash for some god forsaken reason) is especially fun to mess around with, the other mechanics are pretty much standard like wallclimb and double jump etc. However the games main feature which is creating your own save points is more of a miss than a hit, since the areas where you are in a dire need of a save point dont allow you to create one...basicly its a quicksave button that doesnt work sometimes...The combat i will be honest is absolutly AAAAwful, all you do is bash the mouse button for your flying lightbulb of a companion to do absolutly everything for you, yes you dont need to aim or even click on the enemies, just bash that mouse button to make anything that stands in your way go away.The story is meh, The regular Restore light-banish dark and fix the balance because it killed your parents and nuked your house, its meh...done before and better and the fact that this game has absoluty no side characters or even bossfights to remember you will forget about what the game was about 5 minutes in, good thing the platforming and artstyle makes up for the lack of any decent story or this game would have been awful. The one good thing about the story is the motivation of the villan which i wont spoil.The difficulity is quite inconsistent, most of the times its hard and fairly challanging but in 2-3 zones there is a massive difficulity spike that will make you want to toss your computer out of the window, and the challange mostly comes from platforming...which demands you be spot on with your jumps which starts to get on your nervs at some point because sometimes the hitbox messes up or something complitly random is tossed at you which you only could have found out about with trial and error.Aw and unskipable end credits...cause people read that...Overall, Pretty looking, exelent platformer with default story and awful combat, also its on the short side if i hadnt died so many times because of an instant kill trap was thrown at me without any warning i would say its around 10 hours with little to no replay value, there are no hidden treasures or hidden fun collectables to hunt for...so you finish it once and forget about it and the ending (SPOILER ALERT!!!)absolutly ruins the sad and melancholy mood the game was setting up by having the happiest and most clishe ending possible.Overall cant recommend."

Yeah this game is pretty but it's frustrating as ♥♥♥♥. I can only play like 15 minutes before I've had enough and quit it.The controls are buggy and clunky. They introduce a new movement mechanic every level for the hell of it. The game is unintuitive and you will have to refer to walkthroughs. Also if you think you can play without collecting ability points etc you will get to the later content and regret it.There are many sequences where you will simply have to repeat them over and over until you get it right. Because you are propelling yourself off the screen and you don't yet know where to go. Because you're goign through a portal which drops you falling and you have to know in advance which way to fall. (There is a sequence of about 5 of these portals in a row fyi).The save system is bad. Your saves are resources which you can run out of.I'd like to know how many of the people who gave this game positive reviews actually finished it.Some incredibly irritating bugs:In the wall climb part, you're going up this funnel and you think 'wth: ive climbed to the top of this wall and the next wall has not appeared'. Eventually I figured out that you had to jump halfway up each wall to get the next one to spawn. You couldn't climb to the top of each and then jump to the next (whcih, you know, would be the logical thing to do). Please don't try to tell me this is a 'feature' lol. Additionally on that same level, there are some green lasers. Again you jump to them and they turn into platforms. I actually have no idea how I got past that since there was no rhyme or reason to it and it was buggy as ♥♥♥♥ again. I just spammed shift and got lucky. If you played normally it would bug and be impossible to pass.PLAY TEST THE GAME. It's so obvious this wasn't properly play-tested, or the people who did it were crap.

But. But something was definitely missing.The beginning of the game was really outstanding, anticipating a very deep story and tears guarantee. But the story during the whole game just appears in a superficial way. It's a shame because the concept itself is great, but it needs a deeper development to caught yourself in the story.The controls and the graphic are amazing - absolutely nothing to complain about it (maybe a bit too sparkling during fights, but this is only personal taste). The landscapes are also great. The musics..I don't know, they are good indeed, but somewhat repetitive. It's like they don't ""bound"" with the level you are playing sometimes.What it was kinda disappointing for me, is the LACK of boss fighting. Sure, there are parts that can be considered ""boss"" levels when you need to escape, but it's not the same thing. And about the mobs - so few types of mobs for the whole game? In every zone you encounter the same type, maybe just stronger, but with the same attack and you can  use the same strategy to defeat them over and over. There are too many level up perks and not enough mobs.The custom saving point is something not convincing me completely. The game (other than metrovania exploration alike, that is good), looks like a very-lite version of super meat boy. Most of the time you will just die and restart at your last custom check point, train a few until you beat it, and create the next check point. I found this system removed the ""challenge"" and was just giving me nerves - playing not so focused (and loosing more) because I know I can save just after a few again.The levels were you need to escape - water and wind -  were great levels. Adrenaline kick and no save in between. My favorite part indeed. And I'm not saying I want an hardcore platform, some parts were very difficult, it's just with this system you don't feel rewarded for your efforts. Game focus too much on this mechanic.Again, this is absolutely a well crafted game, but I recommend it only to Platform gamers who are more oriented to exploration/100% complete or like the try-die-learn-repeat mechanics. If you are looking for a deep-involving story Platform or something with more ""biodiversity"" (other than landscapes), you should check somewhere else."

The only way to fix that is to enable vsync, but that will limit your game to 60fps(it doesn't matter that you have a 144mhz monitor) and later I found another problem that vsync creates: controls lag, many jump puzzles became almost impossible after I enabled vsync so I had to play it with screen tearing.- I tried to stream it with OBS but it doesn't seem to work, after a single alt+tab it will no longer send data to OBS. Don't know if it's a problem with compatibility with OBS only or any recording program. But this is the only game that had this problem for me.- XBOX controller doesn't seem to work, to be more exact RT button doesn't work. I think that there are some fixes for this on the forums but I preferred to play with keyboard.- If you have a HOTAS connected to PC from time to time it will ignore keyboard controls and use the throttle. All I was able to do to fix this was to restart the game(many many many times)- Some puzzles require grabbing some rocks and moving them. The problem is that 50% of them are bugged and can't be moved. I manage to move some of them using flame charge but that uses energy and requires you to run around searching for energy sources in order to have enough to move what you need.  There are still some that can't be moved by charge either.. I'm actually stuck right now at one of those and I can no longer continue to the next section because of it.- Some walls or rocks don't have a collider so you fall right through them. The fix for this seems to be another game restart.When it works it's a great game, but right now it seems that most of the time it doesn't work. I keep wanting to play it more even with all this bugs, but right now I finally got to a point where I can't play it even if I want because of all it's problems. All I can do is start a new game.After they fix this issues it will be a must have, but right now you are taking a big risk if you buy it."

Unfortunately, it's let down by a lack of thought in the map design and the chaotic jumping. They are clearly very proud of this jumping dynamic, so complicated spikes and jumping scenarios dominate. That's fine if it leads to something - except it often doesn't, so there is little sense of achievement. It becomes repetitive and dull. Frustrating, to keep having to see the same cutscenes. Poor map design  also means that if you are exploring the wrong area, you have the potential to become stuck there for good!Skilled platformers who don't mind repetition should love this. It's got a lot in its favour. For more casual gamers, avoid."

It has stunning visuals, a beautiful soundtrack, varied level design, well-integrated abilities, and it feels very good to control Ori, even though the game borders on using too many different keys.So why am I not recommending this game, you may ask?Late in the game, you are required to break a wall with one of your abilities. It did not work for me. I checked online to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong, and what I saw confirmed my suspicions. The game broke.I have not played this game since. I was too far in to start over and risk having the same thing happen, and I haven't gotten around to hacking my save file so that I start in a slightly different location.

,Not Recommended,261570,15385283,"Posted: 15 April, 2015",all,Bahuemac,"I have mixed feelings.The art is great, the music feels good too though can be a little repetitive at times.  Movements feels great, it's a platformer where for most parts (minus a few a little frustrating sections with no checkpoints) I enjoy the platforming quite a lot, especially certain moves/abilities you obtain later (dashing in midair) are fun to use.However there is also a feeling of shallowness. The intro sequence is emotional but relative eyecandy as you will hardly see similar events over the course of the game. There isn't much of a story to speak of, and according to my progress indicator I'm already near the end of it. You get tossed into a decaying forest, presumably you are somehow at fault for it going down, and you must restore certain elements (wind, water, etc.) of it. It's rather predictable how it works out.I don't feel much responsibility or guilt though, and while I see some efforts from the devs to make you feel something for the world (for example by turning enemies into ""friends"" and by showing that their aggressive behavior towards you is ultimatively only an effect of your presence having ruined the forest and their places of living) there isn't much of narration or anything else substantial to hold onto. On the contrary the gibberishy whining of my spirit companion and the godlike (again gibberishy) overworld voice that narrates certain events with one-liners feel close to being pretentious to me sometimes. It doesn't feel as bad and artifically bloating as for example in ""Nihilumbra"", but it's not exactly something that captures me either.Also, the game doesn't feel optimized too well. It's hardly an Assassin's Creed: Unity, yet I can seemingly only run it in windowed mode (fullscreen keeps crashing) and/or with VSynch enabled. But even then cutscenes keep stuttering/lagging.So, if you expect a constant tear-driver like the intro sequence would suggest, or a deep and actually engrossing story, or a world that you can properly relate to, maybe look elsewhere. If you like Metroidvania-style platforming and find a relatively superficial ""magical"" world appealing enough go ahead. Sadly I will probably forget this game quickly as soon as I'm done with it. It's not bad, but not as special as I would have expected it to be either."

The game is a fun modern take on the old school side-scroller with a lot of challenging content.I do not recommend this game because it appears that you can get yourself stuck in un-winnable situations. The game's save dynamic lets the player choose their own checkpoints upon which to save your progress. When you die, you are instantly respawned at your most recently chosen checkpoint.I currently am about 2 hours into the game, and have accidentally saved at a time where it is impossible to now proceed in the game. Without knowing it, I saved my progress immediately before a section of the map that bars progress beyond it without having access to certain experience point based perks. I do not have the perks, cannot get any more experience in the location which I have found myself stuck in, and so am doomed to never leave the area which I saved in.It seems a shame that such an interesting looking game would have such a terrible oversight.

I'm thumbing down this post not because I would not recommend buying the game. Buy the thing, it's awesome! I'm just leaving this here so that people who are reading for reviews get all of the information they need.This game is beautiful as you can see in the gameplay trailer and screenshots. Unfortunately for someone like me with a crappy machine that graphic comes at a cost. The lag on a mid range laptop is insane and there is no function to tone down the graphical fiddelity and therefore you WILL be forced to play on max graphics even if you have a 300 dollar netbook. Are we clear on that? Great!Onto the actual review.The plot is relatively generic, being that you are trying to defeat a dark monster that is hounding the forest that is the realm of the dark father tree thing. Regardless, the game is very enjoyable and the basic plot and simple characters gives way to a breathtaking world that, despite the actual map consuming a relatively small area, still manages to feel like a sprawling world with beautiful scenery to match. A lot of people describe the game as metriodvania but I am far too young to understand that so I'll just call it an RPG platformer. You only have three rows of customization but that saves you the time that would otherwise be spend scrolling through seventy different stats trying to divide your points into insignificantly incrimenting the damage of your attack. Ori gets to start off unarmed and undefended and ends the game able to rain fire and brimstone upon anything that looks at you funny. The music is also quite nice. Not very distincitve, but nevertheless atmospheric and calming when it needs to be and fast paced when the game demands it.Now the rest of the complaints. I do hate to complain about a game that imediately established itself as one of my favourites but I am a jerk and I am quite bored and I should try to at least balance out the gushing. The main problem I had is simply my problem with my own hardware which, though it is my fault, does leave me wanting to turn down the lag a little through scenes of conflagalation and watery death hot on my trail. The game, I also feel, sometimes falls victim to its own stunning art. The fireball primary attack looks good like everything else, but on higher upgrades the light was just so bright and intense that it was hard to know when to stop firing. The neon-esque color palette can also make it difficult to see Ori throughout the scenery.Despite my complaints: I loved the game. It was both fun and beautiful. Quite cheap as well. Buy it."

I've seen zero developer response on the Steam Forums, and the websitewww.oriblindforest.comdoesn't seem to have a forum to voice our concerns either.Aside from the crashing, there are other issues as well. Upon learning the ""bash"" ability, my Xbox360 wireless controller seems to be stuck in the 'left' direction when trying to aim my bash.

That's true.Beyond that though, its an incredibly derivitive metroidvania game that offers nothing to anyone who wants to look past its presentation for some game play. The base jump mechanic is pretty awful, the wall cling feels clunky, the attack option isn't interesting (you just mash X over and over), and the levels aren't well designed. Having a save system where you can save anywhere try to bandage bad level design where you may fall to your death without warning, or get hit by enemies while at 3/5 health and suddenly die isn't a good choice.It's really a shame.

Eventually more attack options are opened up but they remain secondary or special use attacks. Mashing the X button remains the main attack mode as far as I have gotten into the game.The platforming is probably the largest failing of the game. Jump controls feel very flaky, making the same jump 5 times can seemingly result in very different results. This isn't much of a problem until the game throws you into a timed jumping gauntlet that takes around 3 minutes to make a full run through it. If you make anything other than the smallest mistake expect to start the sequence over again. The result for me at least was that between flaky jumps and each new twist jump required I repeated the first few mind numbingly simple jumps dozens of times just to get back to where I was to figure out the next almost puzzle level jumping sequence. During all of this if you don't keep moving you're instantly killed by water. An there is no rest in death, the game instantly respawns you after death, and oh no, the water is rising, better move quick before it kills you."

The platforming is real smooth and tight, and the character movement feels perfectly weighted. (UPDATE: After playing more, I have to say that the platforming isn't as tight as it first seemed. The behavior of wall jumping in particular can be very erratic)In case you are wondering, yes, the lack of rebindable keys is a huge deal breaker for me. The current setup uses the X key as the attack key. And it's just weird to press X and Spacebar at the same time. It's not comfortable at all for me, and neither am I used to it. In the cases where X keys have been used in platformers before, I always rebind it to S or D as that feels more comfortable for my hands.As I'm playing further, I get to use C for another type of attack. I find this to be even more uncomfortable. My fingers are cramped at X, C and Spacebar, and I often find myself hitting D cause that is so much more ergonomic and sensible.Update: Another issue I have realized is that certain animations in the game seem to be locked to 30fps. The character moves at 60fps, but some background animations and secondary character animations are at 30fps and it just feels weird. And there is stutter every now and again as well that is very much noticeable and just cheapens the experience for me. Mind you, I have a sharp eye for framerate and stutter issues, so it probably bugs me more than it would bug the average gamer.Update 2: A further issue I have encountered is that the wall jumps seem to be unreliable. Ori will sometimes not latch on to the sides of the walls and just fall down. In the parts where you are jumping between two walls laden with thorns, this causes immense frustration."

That's kind of what Ori and the Blind Forest felt like. It's gorgeous on the surface, but when you get down to business you start having second thoughts. It took me 7 hours to complete and I died 261 times. I can't give it a negative review, because it's a very lovingly crafted game and the world is truly something to behold. However, I can warn you about the bad stuff and let you decide for yourself if any of these are dealbreakers:1: ""Nice forest you've got there! It'd be a shame if someone covered fricking everything with spikes, wouldn't it?"" I wasn't expecting this game to have death coated death with death filling. I sure hope you like jumping puzzle gauntlets of spikes and one shot death rays that you're forced to repeat over and over with floaty controls, because that's what's on the menu. Nothing takes the majestic out of something like being forced to repeat it until you're ready to throw your controller through the monitor because a random rock hiding behind blinding particle effects just one shot you at the end of a gauntlet while the screen was shaking so hard you couldn't even see what was going on.2: The combat is terrible. Fighting enemies just isn't fun. You spam an auto-aim attack while trying not to get hit by blinding bright orb thingies hiding behind other blindingly bright thingies. You can't tell which thingies are which, because everything you do or encounter involves blinding bright thingies.3: Your movement starts out very gimped and you can't reach most areas until the end of the game. Just when running and jumping around finally becomes fluid, it's over. I understand that upgrading abilities is part of progression and has its place, but I think the curve was a bit off here. There's a constant feeling of being held back until the last couple hours.All in all, I still have to give it a positive review because it's a serviceable platformer with an exceptionally beautiful world. If you're looking for great gameplay though, I'd much sooner recommend Rayman Origins, Rayman Legends, or Battleblock Theater for platforming fun. Ori is largely style over substance and rings a bit hollow because of it."

Do not hesitate!Summary+ Beautiful Art+ Beautiful Music+ Beautiful Story+ Unique Abilities+ Challenging Gameplay• Die a lot• Can't revisit some areas- Hard to play with mouse and keyboardDetailsAlthough I fell in love with the artistic of the game when i first saw the launch trailer, for some reasons, it doesn't make me interested in the game enough to buy it. A few months later, when I saw the Behind the Music trailer, I instantly went to YouTube to watch people play it, and didn't waste any time to bought both the game and soundtrack right afterward. I felt so terribly for waiting that long. I could say that the game is perfect not just because of the art, but also combined with the music.Even so, art and music are not the only two things that make this game perfect. The story is very touching in every moments, right from the beginning to the end. I'm not going to spoil anything here. But, I guess I have to mention that I sob uncontrollably the first time I watch the ending on YouTube, and still had tearful eyes when I play it myself :')Talking about gameplay, it's also great and challenging. It contains some unique abilities not found in most other games. However, there is a big CAUTION. This game is freaking hard and you are certainly going to die a lot before you finish the game. If you're a person who often rage quit on games, I'm advise not to play it. But, if you really want to, try play it while you're in a good mood, and take some rest when you're stuck. I suggest using controller if you have one. I find it very hard to use mouse and keyboard in this game. I managed to finished the game with them in the end, though.Note that certain areas are blocked after you finished them. Make sure you collect everything you need before leaving/entering any place, especially those ones that you have to go through a door. Also, once you've finish a game, you're completely locked out of that game forever and need to start a new game.In summary, I'm giving this a full score. Now that I've finished the game, I can't wait to find some more free time to play it again and find all the secrets and collectibles. Possibly trying to get the hardcore achievements like Immortal and Elite, too. :)"

Having finished with 99% completion I can say that it is one of the few games that made me want to go out and get collectibles. Normally I am not a completionist at all, and this game can be done without the extra health and energy pickups. But with each new ability gained, moving around the world gets more and more fun. I don't play too many platformers-the last one I did play was Braid, years ago- but this one hooked me from the start.Pros:-Visuals, absolutely gorgeous. The level of detail put into this world is meticulous.-Music: Engrossing. Part of it has to do with the gameplay, because it's sometimes quite fast paced and unforgiving. The music really draws you into the moment and enhances the tension you're feeling.-Smooth controls. I played on a keyboard/mouse setup, but I believe a controller would be just as intuitive.-Challenging, to the right amount. Satisfying when you get past an area you died on dozens of times.-Storyline is somewhat tried and true, but the emotions felt and connection created between the limited characters are strong.Cons:-Can be EXTREMELY frustrating. Cheap deaths, for sure, but in the end it makes the game what it is.I don't write many reviews, so I'm not very good at them. But if you're on the fence about Ori, I recommend it.

Now with that out of the way, onto the review.Ori and the Blind Forest is about the Guardian Spirit Ori who is seperated from the Spirit Tree at birth and is raised by Naru. Life was good until the forest start to decay and die. Ori set off on an adventure to find out why and restore life to the forest. Since Ori do not speak, most of the story is told by the narrator and Sein, the light and eyes of the Spirit Tree.  The story is pretty straight forward, but do have a good twist on why the main antagonist is the way they are. The opening is heartwarming only to throw some tragedy into it. Even though the game can look happy and colorful, the story can take some dark turns.The gameplay is 2D platformer, similar to Metroid. You progress through an area until you find an ability that will allow you to get to new areas. There an upgrade system, that will let you upgrade your abilities and attacks. Along with finding new abilities, as you progress through events new areas will become available to you. You may find yourself doing some backtracking to find powerups and other things to help you upgrade Ori and Sein. One unique thing this game do is have save states, called soul links. You gotta decide when to use it because the meter that determine the number of time you can save state also allow you perform heavier attacks or open doors. So you got to use control saving otherwise you may find yourself at a door you can't open because you no longer have the energy to open it.This game look like beautiful  picture book. The whole time I'm playing this game, I felt like I was running through a forest painting. Each area force me to use my new techniques in combination with my old to overcome various platforming challenges. I found myself getting more involved in the story than I thought I would. My only negative comment is that it fairly short, you could probably clear it in 4~5 hours first playthrough if you're not going for 100% and backtracking. But don't let that stop you from joining Ori in this beautiful forest."

Going in, I was hoping for a great story with some halfway decent platforming elements, but instead I received a great platformer with some halfway decent story elements.  That doesn't mean it's not a great game.  I really loved it, and the difficulty was spot on, getting slightly more difficult with every new objective, and always staying just out of the realm of easy.  However, I felt as though the story was merely slapped onto the start and finish with an extended fetch quest as filler in between.  What story there was in the middle felt like dry exposition, and didn't really have the emotional depth of the start and finish.  (The opening two minutes had me crying, but nothing after that made me feel anything whatsoever, except for a bit of confusion here and there, until the finale which gave a really nice, happy feeling)  That being said, the art design was breathtaking, the music was phenomenal, the platforming was fluid and intuitive, and the mechanics were simple, fun, and increasingly clever.Final verdict/TLDR:Definitely worth playing, but not as focused on storytelling as you may be led to believe.

Make no mistake however, it only adds to the feels as I watch the credits roll, work the pain out of my fingers and sit back and enjoy the last tender moments as the story comes to a close.I was on the edge of my seat nearly the entire time, rewarded for every successful secret area unlocked, never mind that it took me 20 attempts, dammit I did it!!!Ori and the Blind Forest was worth every dime spent, every failed crushing defeat, every unforgiving trap sprung. The music was rich and invigorating, the story had depth and sucked you in at every step of the way. This game is challenging, don't be fooled by the soft graphics and loveable main character.

Minimalistic but just absolutely beautiful, I loved it!I really liked the gameplay too, a really solid platformer with some nice character development.The Metroidvania open world was really nicely built and I had a lot of fun exploring it. The game gives you many great skills along the way and (for me at least) they felt really natural almost instantly. The game really made me use the whole skill arsenal and that's just great game design.It get's pretty challenging towards the end, but I think the hard parts are necessary. There are a couple of really tedious running parts where you have to ace the whole thing at one go, and it definetely made me curse and think of quitting. But it set the tone, I felt really small and helpless, which is what the character actually is and finally after completing the part, it always made sense. Just phenomenal story telling. A similar emotional rollercoaster just wouldn't be possible in any other medium.I would recommend this game to pretty much anyone, but I'm sure it's a bit too hard for some. Even for those people I would recommend playing the beginning though, only the last third of the game is hard and I strongly suggest you to stick with it, it's worth it.More experienced gamers don't even have that excuse, get it, it's awesome."

I'm not sure if I'm writing this review in support of the game, or myself.I didn't think I'd have the time to enjoy a game, especially with all that's been happening in my life lately.  Sure, I'm now behind on some chores and errands, but it's worth it.  Laugh if you must, but the sun seems a bit brighter today.Somehow, this game managed to hit all the right spots for me.  The feeling I got when I watched The Lion King as a kid, the joy I had playing Metroid, and how touched I was when I watched Spirited Away - it just wrapped up so many memories in an original format and served them all on a dinner plate.  This is by far the most beautiful game I've played, and in so many aspects: the story, the characters, the art, and most definitely the music.The play is very responsive, and involving.  The game was never dull or repetative, and new mechanics were introduced at a very comfortable pace with some puzzles delivering a fresh experience well before anything could get boring.  Some parts were very challenging, almost frustrating, but I'm sure any player will be able to finish them before the adrendaline rush wears off.So, how did this make me rethink my life?  I grew up wanting to be a game developer, just so I can share with others all the feelings I so enjoyed in this game and the games I grew up with.  But, rarely do we follow our childhood dreams well into adulthood.  While my career ship has sailed in a completely different direction, maybe it's not too late for me to toss a rope to the gamer I've rediscovered with this game.To the developers all across the globe (no, really; there's no ""Moon HQ""): I'm sure you'll never see this in your huge pile of ""thank you"" letters, but for what it's worth: I express my thanks as much as some stranger on the Internet ever can.

Yes, it is. Will you die? Yes, you will. How much will depend on you though (my first playthrough ended with 248 deaths).But besides the handfull of frustratingly difficult moments (for which, once you learn the curve, you can only blaim yourself for failing), Ori and the Blind Forest is a rare gem of a game. It's striking visuals, amazing soundtrack which can be both bombasticly grand and touchingly gentle at times and a tear-jerking story (yes, i cried manly tears. Any real man would with this game's story.).It's an amazing mix of Disney, Studio Ghibli and a couple of original touches, with a world that is a piece of art to behold.

Character voices are cute and mild, not annoying at all. The voiceovers are in another language (maybe a made-up one? I dunno) a la Shadow of the Colossus. Cutscenes are as short as they need to be to tell the story - they never feel too long or boring.Graphics/Art: Gorgeous. Many many layers in the background and foreground, things moving all the time, pretty glows. Each area has its own distinctive feel, making every area seem fresh.Mechanics: Some of the later skills take some getting used to, but once you've mastered them they feel effortless. You really can zoom around. Movement feels really smooth. I felt like a parkour badass the whole time.Level design: Great! The harder puzzles have clever solutions. Lots of variety. Not stupidly hard. I consider myself a gamer of average skill, and this game was challenging enough to be interesting, but never frustrating or tiring.Music: Great. Beautiful, haunting, bittersweet. The main menu tune might get stuck in your head. Buy the soundtrack. DO ITTL;DR: Great game. Never gets boring.

If the sound of a sidescroller that sometimes requires perfect precision in some sequences doesn’t scare you, then this game is recommended. There was a few places that required 30 or 60 minutes of my time.Also there is backtracking in the game. Backtracking usually bothers me in video games if overused, but so far it's pretty artfully done so it doesn't bother me too much."

A true example of games as an art if I've ever seen one.2) It is challenging. You will probably die a lot.3) You will probably need a controller to really enjoy this game.I've been playing platformers for over 20 years. This is among the finest I've ever seen. The controls are very smooth and easy to memorize as you progress through the game. There is enough variance that it doesn't feel 'button-mashy' like some other platformers. I still died a lot, but I didn't mind as much. The score is wonderful to listen to, and it doesn't cut the track short or start it over every time you die, which was very helpful to my overall sanity.Hats off to Moon Studios.

It's a gorgeous set of game tracks, but they don't stand on their own. In fact, most of the music seems to be more or less directly derived from the music of Princess Mononoke. If you listen to the soundtrack of that film, you will notice almost identical chord progressions and melodies.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYd7scpuedcNeutralDifficulty can vary a bit wildly, but this is not necessarily bad. A bit of stress between the easy parts.Plays best with a controller.Quite short. I achieved about 95% completion in ~8 hours.Plot is rather shallow, and relies more on emotional button-pressing than actual story. Not a ""con"" because it's good for a platformer.ConThe game's background art was often obtrusive, making it very confusing what was an interactable surface or hazard, and what was decoration.Sometimes too many intense, bright particle visuals. It can be hard to tell what's a missile and what'sToo much running around with quickly respawning enemies makes travel tedious, and by the end of the game, you'll tire of it.Abnormally demanding of hardware for a platformer. Have a new-ish computer or the gameplay will suffer.Some skills aren't described well enough, and you can unlock abilities that just don't work until you progress in the main story.The platformer gameplay is pretty unoriginal - you won't do much that you didn't do with Mario and Sonic.

No such problem here - i had fun until the very end and collected everything i could (missed an upgrade or two in an area that became unaccessible after certain plot events).Just a note - this game is hard (at least by today's standards). It does require a bit of skill and reflex, but then again most platformers do. Normally you can save almost anywhere and try as many times as you need - you're not penalized in any way for dying except being relocated to latest checkpoint or manual save. Saving the game does require energy which is in short supply at the beginning of the game, however by the time you really need to save more often you can both upgrade your energy capacity and buy an upgrade allowing you to reuse your save points without spending extra energy. So no complaints here.However, there are a few sequences when you do something and have to run for your life. The escape route can be a bit complex, and the game becomes unforgiving here: either you do it right, or start at the beginning of the sequence, no saves allowed here. It can get a bit tiresome when you know what you have to do but fail to execute one of a few dozen jumps just the right way or get delayed in some other way, and bang - start over again. Try not to smash the screen with your controller when you do ;)But still, that's one solid gaming experience. I totally recommend it if you like a bit of a challenge."

,Recommended,261570,16767706,"Posted: 28 June, 2015",all,TordenFaaret,"You know, when I first started this game and played through the prologue, I hated it. I hated the story I felt was too predictable and doubted it would hold up, even if it looked and sounded like a masterpiece already. Yet what it lacked in the prologue, it made up for ten times over in the rest (and the ending genuinely surprised me because of the good stuff in-between, but I'm getting ahead of myself).First off: Good lord is this game delicious. Not only are the visuals beautiful, but the orchestral score is breathtaking. I remember thinking to myself ""god, I HATE this game, but THIS MUSIC"" and then symbolic tears of happiness ran down my mental cheeks as to not impair my vision. If you're not sure whether or not to get this game yet, find the music and lend an ear to it. You won't regret it.Second: The controls are as tight as they are clunky and frustrating. When people talk about how playing games might better your reaction skills and dexterity, this is the game I think of: it's fast paced, and even one slip up is entirely on you. Sure, I got frustrated a lot when I first played through this, but that was when I tried to play it like surgery, which is something this game teaches you that you can not do. It feels like just about every mistake I make is my fault, and who am I to fault a game for venting my frustrations? (For the record, I do not have a controller, and all the important keys you need to press are pushed into the left side of your keyboard, one of them being the shift button. I could play without my mouse, but I chose not to.)Third: The villain is an owl. Not only that, an owl with black and purple feathers and white glowing eyes. I won't spoil too much, but I'm glad they didn't go black and white with this one. It's so easy to make a villain that does evil just because they're the opposite of good, but I felt genuine empathy for an owl that on multiple occasions tried to kill Ori and made me flinch many of those times, and I love this game for it. Sure, it adds to the predictability of the story, but let's just settle on the fact that this game is not as much about the story as it is about you having fun and call it a day.Finally, its story may not be the most original out there, and sure I hated the part where I had to play flappy-bird (using the shift-key on my windows computer, mind you... I hope you have a controller...), the game has a way of sucking you in, wrapping you up in the world and showing you its wonders by making everything grand a part of the game. At the same time, I've played through this game almost three times now, and I still feel like I haven't seen everything (but my computer is crap, so according to steam I haven't even finished the game once because my computer crashes in the middle of the last cutscene... I hope you don't have a school computer...) and that kind of replay value is priceless.I know my review was highly biased, but really, you're not reading this to see what someone who hasn't gotten emotionally involved with the game has to say, you're here to see whether or not this game could be worth your money, and I'd say yes. It is worth every little penny you put into owning it. If platform games aren't your bread and butter, I'd still say give it a go. Ori and the Blind Forest is a game in its own league, and deserves your attention."

I don't usually write reviews b/c I'm skeptical that anyone will read them, but I had to write one for Ori and the Blind Forest. Everything you've heard about this game is true: atmospheric, pretty tough but not rage-quit status, emotionally-stirring. When I finally made it out of the Ginso Tree, my heart was beating so fast I had to stop and take a break. It's a graphical achievement too. I could sit and stare at the title screen for hours. The story makes you want to keep going because you want to learn more about how your world used to be before it all went to hell and what it's going to look like when you restore it to it's former glory. I'm a little confused about my relationship with the narrator. I'm sure one of my children was crying and I missed some important plot point. At any rate, if you love platformers and georgeous games, quit reading and get this."

All this is supported with very polished graphics coupled with orchestral delight that could have been signed by Jeremy Soule or Joe Hisaishi (if the credits only didn’t said otherwise).It should be pointed out that boss sequences may be frustrating, and camera panning occasionally gets in the way of fast-paced runs, but these are minor issues that get quenched by general refinement of this title.All in all, it is as fun to play as it is beautiful. Entertainment for all senses that comes highly recommended!"

The art style and music really push the feel and atmosphere into high gear especially for a 2D platformer. Gameplay wise the jumping, combat, and puzzles never get old and are always fun especially with the new abilities you constanly gain that make you stronger and more versatile. I haven't beaten it yet but I'm already completely satisfied and more with the purchase. The only downside is that you have to manually save for most of the game and if you forget to do so for a period of time it will cause you some serious frustration, so remember to do so. It also requires soul energy to save so if you're at a difficult point and cannot find souls to refill your slots you'll either have to backtrack to find some or wing it with a lot more frustration. Other than that, pretty well near perfect platformer for everybody and definitely my favorite purchase on steam so far this year. Buy it."

76561197978036015,Recommended,261570,16874020,"Posted: 4 July, 2015",all,gijones10,"Visually and Aurally this game is stunning and almost every review on here (positive or negative) will agree on that.  The story is fairly basic and not overly interesting but I guess it serves it's purpose to drive the game forward.  I'm not going to extol the virtues of the game further than this - there's thousands of reviews here that already do that.  Instead I'm going to talk about some of the problems.The first issue that you're likely to notice is that there are often lots of very similarly coloured flashing elements on the screen at once.  This makes it extremely difficult to tell the difference between 'good' shiney and 'bad' shiney.  Not a big deal as you progress and collect a few upgrades but early on is definitely an annoyance.  A simliar problem arises further on into the game where you need to navigate multiple glowing teleporters surrounded by dangerous regions in quick succession.  The sequence wouldn't be terribly challenging if not for Ori blending in and being camoflaged by teleporters.  This makes being able to easily tell where Ori is on the screen a nightmare especially when you need to react quickly to avoid yet another death.The Bash mechanic made me want to rip my hair out with frustration.  The idea itself wasn't bad but the execution.... I'm just going to say the controls didn't feel intuitive at all in the beginning.  I did improve though and by the end I was pretty pro at navigating it... which brings me to the next problem.The reliance on executing extremely long platforming sequences flawlessly is annoying if not rage inducing (if you've played Nihilumbra think of the Escape the Void parts).  You will die. A lot.  More than once I got frustrated to the point that I had to quit (Ginso Tree I'm looking at you).  It was that or risk throwing my controller through the monitor.  I play games to have fun and to be entertained.  I don't mind being challenged but this style of gameplay goes way beyond that and is decidedly un-fun.  Having said that the sections that followed this were nowhere near as long or as difficult once you'd gotten the hang of using all your abilities together.Finally, I think the game design is flawed in that certain sections are closed off and/or cannot be revisited once traversed.  So if you miss any items or secrets on the way through and/or inadventantly stumble into an area that triggers an event (without warning I might add) - it's pretty much a case of too bad, so sad.  That's not good enough in my opinion.  I have limited time and very rarely go back to play through a game I've already completed.  So I try to get as much as I can out of one play through (in this case 42/50 achievements) and this is a massive annoyance.  Additionally, some of the achievements appear to be bugged (Airborne doesn't trigger no matter what I do).Overall, apart from one or two disproportionate difficulty spikes the game is fun to play, and I'd recommend to anyone, especially if you see it on sale."

(As of mine on this day)Ori is one of those titles you can tell everyone gave it all to make the best possible game they could and for the most part it does work.Our little hero is tasked to bring the world back to the light after a Evil bird like creature name Kuro turns it to darkness and near death. Many trials await you as you fullfill this job. From the enviroment itself to enemies who are warped from despair and anger. With your ally Sein you'll have means to defend yourself and gain more as time goes on.This is a game full of stunning artistic detail and yet behind it this tale is full of grim and dark natured tones. While to some that might be a turn off, its presentation spurred me on to complete this. The world is never light and dark with a whole lot of grey. Ori is no different here.This would fall under the ""Metroidvania"" class of games. But this is probably one of the more difficult ones ever I've touched.  Others have complained about this and one other factor. You will die and you will die often first go around. If you don't like this then, yeah stay away from this one. There is a reason a no death run is the hardest achievement on here. Ori isn't a tank, and has to finesse his way through this game.  Which brings me to the second point. Controls. They suggest beforehand to use a controller and I DON'T argue with that. Keyboard controls are very rough indeed. If you completed this with a one it should be an achievement.  To me controls are very precise and in areas I had to let go of the stick to make sure I stick the jump or landing. Your hand tends to overcorrect.  Control does help to the difficulty as areas because of the precision needed.  However, instead of getting frustrated I was more feeling accomplished when I cleared sections.And I won't get into the music. It comes in exactly when its needed and makes the moments and game more powerful in its presentation.So between the feels of the story (and there is quite a few) and the challenge...I can fully recommend this. Still on the fence about Ori, then wait until a sale to lessen the blow if you end up not liking it."

In these area's you will die a lot and have to retry over and over again untl you get it just right.

The story is cute and has a few twists, and the graphics and music are consistently great the entire way through.  Don't be fooled by the cute graphics, though; this is also a difficult, challenging platformer that will scratch the itch of anybody who's looking for a hard Metroidvania.  I'd put it about in the same league as Guacamelee.  There's a large world map with a ton of secrets and little nooks and crannies to explore, and you get a few very innovative abilities over the course of the game that will make you think creatively to solve puzzles.Still, the game has a few flaws, and they're mostly design decisions that will only really bother experienced gamers.  Most notably, there are a few areas that you cannot return to after completing.  If you miss any items or don't fill out the map there, it will haunt you forever.  After entering the last dungeon, you can't leave, and after you complete the game, it locks you out of your save game and you can't go back and try to complete things; you have to start a new game if you want to be a completionist.  There's also no way to teleport between areas, so you'll be doing a lot of running back and forth across the world map while you search for items.  Finally, there are a few timed ""escape"" segments that are more difficult than anything else in the game, and while they're very satisfying once you complete them, they could potentially be difficult enough to discourage people who aren't skilled at platformers.On the up side, the developers have stated that they're working on a ""Definitive Edition"" of the game that is supposed to address all of the common complaints.  With that in mind, I can easily recommend Ori; even with its flaws, it's still a great game.  Buy it and play through it now so that you'll have a frame of reference when the Definitive Edition comes out and you'll want to play through it again."

Luckily, most of the enemyes are infequent and quite easy, especialy with the right upgrades.The save system is... wierd. Why? Because you have to manualy place most of the save points in the game. And its bad for both the fequent saver and the one who doesn't. If you save fequently with your own savepoints, you're going to lose all of your energy, and when you get to a energy door or a breakabel wall, you cant go trough. And if you don't save enough you are gonna lose a LOT of progress most of time. Which makes me wonder why didn't use a autosave system, after it does so at vital times, thankfuly.But before you think '' Welp this game sucks'' it does still have some more redeming features than just art and music.Platforming is solid with many more moves being tacked on as you progress, kepping the game somewhat fresh.And some of the chalenges you face are also pretty good and keeps the game fresh fx. changes in gravilty, changes in the area and being starked by a one-hit kill enemy and having to go to safety before it kills you.So it is the worst game ever? No, not at all. Is it the best? Close but not quite.8/10( i apologize if there is any grammatical mistakes)"

The game is designed that when you die you quickly respawn to the area to try again, there are times the situations are trial and error until you figure out the exact way to overcome something.The music is astounding, the story is told almost entirely non verbally and instead told through visuals.I'd highly recommend the game."

,Recommended,261570,18440472,"Posted: 12 October, 2015",all,Dorrivix,"This review will be cut into four sections. Story, Gameplay, Art direction, And music.Story: A creature, Ori, born from a leaf, made of pure light, gets whisked away during a weathery night. Another creature, of unknown origin, Naru, finds Ori and takes Him/Her in as her own child. Presumably years later, Ori and Naru build a bridge to another part of the forest to gather some kind of fruit. The night after the bridge was built, a light ceremony is being held to ward off a massive threat to the forest. Eventually the story forces Ori to find a way to restore the forest of Nibel.Gameplay: tight, fast paced, and difficult. Definitely not your average casual game. This is more directed to people who want a challenge, but aren't going to throw their controller out the window. This game is oriented to those who have gamepads, not keyboard and mouse.Art direction: Phenomenal. Beautiful environments, various places to visit, Enemy designs have some consistancy (IE, the jumpers do mostly the same thing except their streingth veries. Character designs are very likeable and differ vastly.Music: This game is worth buying just for the music alone, it's that good.

76561197998825270,Recommended,261570,15839169,"Posted: 15 May, 2015",all,The Dorf,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcq80C5vkXkYou may remember this game from its brief demo at E3 last year (2014) where a white squirrel thing was shown jumping through beautiful scenery. It was one of the most visually memorable trailers I saw at E3 last year. And I'm happy to report the game is just as strikingly beautiful as its trailer. Ori and the Blind forest is a Metroidvania style platformer and is the first game from indie developer Moon Studios. I suspect Moon Studios is comprised of at least a couple industry veterans as this game is beautiful, very well designed and oozes quality.Before being published by Microsoft, Ori and the Blind Forest was developed in the Unity engine over the course of four years. Moon Studios cited the Rayman and Metroid franchises as influences for these games, and that's immediately obvious in both the high quality artwork (Rayman) and gameplay (Metroid). I'm personally a big fan of Metroidvania style gameplay, but since the Metroid series is somewhat MIA right now and Castlevania seems to be content making God of War clones, I've had to turn to other games like Ori to get my Metroidvania fixIf you've never played a Metoidvania style game before, the game is usually set in a large, non-linear game world with an emphasis on exploration and finding secrets. They often feature some sort of blend of platforming and combat, and often have light RPG elements where you can progress and improve your player character. Ori chooses to go somewhat light on the combat aspect (most enemies can be defeated by simply mashing the attack button), but instead focus most of the difficulty in the game around platforming. I didn't find the combat in this game that engaging or challenging at all, but there were a few segments that demanded perfect execution of precision platforming in a limited amount of time and messing up required repeating the entire platforming segment. It never felt TOO frustrating, but it was close.Aside from this game's striking visuals, the first unique thing I noticed about it is that Ori will let you save nearly anywhere you like and at any time you like, provided there are no enemies nearby and you also have enough ""spirit energy"", which this game uses as currency for saving. Since the player can save anywhere and anytime they wish, Ori is free to ramp up the difficulty of the platforming to a pretty high level and also introduce enemies and hazards that can kill you in one hit. But it never feels unfair because you only lose as much progress since you last saved. I found I had enough spirit energy to comfortably save about every 30 seconds. It's kind of the Super Meat Boy effect. The game is quite difficult and you'll die often, but it never becomes too frustrating or feels too unfair because you only lose about 5-10 seconds of progress and then the game immediately brings you right back to try again.SummaryIf you like Metroid or Castlevania styled games, or games like Guacamelee!, for instance, you may want to give Ori a try. Or if you dig really artsy and visually striking games, Ori also applies. I really enjoyed my time with Ori and the Blind Forest and am looking forward to see what's next from Moon StudiosFor more game reviews, check outhttp://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/"

,Recommended,261570,16353835,"Posted: 13 June, 2015",all,King Vicious,"'Ori and the Blind Forest' is without a doubt one of the most wonderful games I've ever played. It brought me back to a time when videogames were still full of wonder and awe, and I didn't just rush through a tired obstacle course to unlock the next item or level, but lingered and explored because I wanted to, because I never knew what was around the next corner. It made me feel like a child again. Simple yet engaging and beautifully touching, with gorgeous music and art direction, it was an absolute masterpiece of story telling. I only wish there was more of it, as it's cursed with the same drawback as a good book: once it's over it's over, and there's nothing left for it but to read it again if you're so inclined. But it's a magnificent journey while it lasts.11/10, would feel innocent again."

I definitely did NOT cry in the first 10 minutes.Great gameplay mechanics, gorgeous visuals, and brilliant story telling mix to give a really great game.However, beware. Depite all that, it's still a platformer. Be prepared to try and try again at the same section. And again. And again.100% worth it though.

It doesn't have boss fights but the challenging elemental sequences and the overall gameplay make more than up for that and it ain't afraid to let you die multiple times to show you games can still be difficult and will be satisfying as you complete the challenges. The story isn't big but yet beautiful in it's own way as you cannot blame the actions both parties make as you find out what happened. Let's hope there will be more from where this came from cause it might not be very long but will satisfy you and make you want more of it.

From art direction and sound to storytelling and controls. Smooth transitions of art and sound from the different themes of the game world. A small and accessible game in terms of time consumtion yet a grand and challenging game concerning the background art and the gameplay.When I was young and had infinite amount of time. Frustrating challenges such as gradius and castlevania was a joyful pain. Trying to overcome the obstacles by mastering every single step of the way. Nowadays with family, house and career the amount of time available is very limited so I tend to stay away from time sinks. That means I have never finished a single metroid prime game. That means I haven't even tried my hands at any rayman games.I can sometimes miss that type of games, so this is it. This is the entertainment value I found in Super metroid but compacted into a few hours of gameplay.One single gnawing flaw though. When the main villain Kuro shows up it is all business but between her encounters there is a problem. The other ""boss battles"", they are jokes. Pointless for the gameplay and nonsensical to the overall art direction.With that said.This is something I can afford in terms of time so I highly recomend that you lend it a few hours of yours."

The art style and graphics look superb. Ori is a minuscule little creature but darts and jumps across the screen very gracefully and once you get your hands on some of the later game skills it becomes a real pleasure to race through parts of the world that you've visited before.The save system is also really great, once you start reminding yourself to place save points before tackling a difficult section, it really makes dying a few times a little less frustrating, knowing you mostly have control over where you respawn and how far you have to travel again.I found the game difficulty just right. Most of the standard playthrough is challenging but it never really took me more than a couple of respawns to get past an area. The puzzle platforming is good too, especially a section which changes the gravity mechanics, really making you think about it. The games does get fairly tricky in the few levels which occur at the end of major story points which you have to escape from collapsing levels and such. The first of these I struggled with and had to leave the game overnight and try the following day to beat, and these are the only sections where I found the game get a little frustrating, but the sense of accomplishment after completing these was well worth it.The story starts off quite sad but is altogether heart-warming in the end. Even though none of the characters speak, and the narration is in some form of fictional language, the actions of the various characters tell everything.The biggest enjoyment I got from the game was the gameplay mechanics. Jumping, dodging, climbing walls, launching and stomping enemies and using you spirit flame, all felt so fluid and smooth. As the game progresses you learn new skills which help you traverse the world even quicker and more easily, I found this kept me playing, the more you played through the story, the more enjoyable the movement became.Even if you don't regularly look for platformers to play, as I usually don't, please play this! I was pleasantly surprised and would find it difficult to imagine anyone else not enjoying this game. A truly great, simple, yet truly enjoyable game and one of my personal unexpected favourites of 2015."

I absolutely love the arts (very typical Microsoft Studio type with lots of color and smooth movements). The difficulty is balanced (not overwhelmingly hard and still challenging.)The story is very well done. It's emotional and the content about raging nature sometimes reminds me of Ghibli movie - Princess Mononoke. The music going along with the scene makes it sooo much better. (Try the water rising level, it's gorgeous and stunning; It gave me goosebump by the outstanding art, making me feel so small in the furious surrounding)I hardly can find any cons. The only cons I may think of is the video during the cutscene (only). Either my laptop is too crappy to play it properly or the video itself has the problem. It occasionally reverse the video upside down for a slight moment and it got stunned during the process. The music sometimes make static noise as well. (oh well, maybe my speaker is also crappy.) lol!Overall, the game is VERY good and I'd recommend it to everyone. It has good story, good art, good music and decent price as well. One of my friend complained about it being pricey but I told him he is being cheap. I'd even pay more than that for the game. (I bought this during the sale for the sole reason that I haven't really make a lot of money yet but if I do, I'd pay a lot more to support the developer making more games like this!!)Hope this review gives you guys some idea to buy the game.

I'm super into platformers and always like good ones with a submersive atmosphere. Ori and the Blind Forest does a damn good job of that. It also is very important to note that this game proves that you can make a very good platformer while NOT using the 8-bit art style. As cool and nostalgic as it is, not enough games have actually aesthetically appealing art styles. However something I noticed and it may simply be my crappy graphics card but there are a significant amount of visual errors. I don't know what's causing them but I'll get things like giant black rectangles at the bottom of maps or just below a spirit link the background will just be a bright purple as if it's the texture missing thing.

Every positive aspect of every Metro-vania style game that came before comes together to make this masterpiece that is Ori and the Blind Forest.The action in this game is crazy fast, it keeps you on your toes, but the controls don't hold you back, they're super-responsive. This game strikes the perfect balance between reasonably challenging and totally brutal. If you run out of health, you die, but unlike other games where you have a significant several-second delay or even a condescending ""Game Over"" screen (NINTENDO!) before you can resume playing. This game doesn't give you any of that. If you die, you're sent back to your save point instantly, there's no delay, you can retry. Because of that, you sometimes have a sense of ""ah, dang, I died again, but that's okay! I can just try again!"". You get frustrated in this game, but you don't get discouraged by it at all, even through the several dozen/hundred times that you WILL inevitably die in this game. More the opposite, it makes you want to try again, to beat that area even more! That's the magic of the gameplay that this title has.The visuals are absolutely stunning. If I bought a 4K monitor just to play this game on, it would be totally worth it because the artwork is the most beautiful yet unintrusive eye candy I have ever seen in a game like this. Such rich and vibrant colours, but with a really awesome atmospheric feel to the setting that I can't get enough of. If you're on a TN monitor, I feel sorry for you.Ori and the Blind Forest's soundtrack is wonderful. I love it. It reinforces the addictive nature anti-discouragement characteristics of this game so well, and it's beautiful to listen to on its own, too. I listened to the game's music and then tried to listen to Super Mario Galaxy's famously-orchestrated music, and the difference is like night and day. SMG's sountrack is nice but next to the Ori soundtrack sounds terrible. The music in this game calms you down, gives you feelings of the area you're in, and sets your heart racing whenever it feels like it. I get adrenaline rushes from the dungeon escapes just because of the music, it's terrific.The storyline is great. It's simple, there's not a lot to it, but that's all you need. Even though Sein is the only one who talks throughout the game, it is just enough to make you understand what is going on without pages and pages of dialogue. Sein is the Navi that Navi should have been.If I had one wish it would be that this game was longer. Don't get me wrong - this game is a good 8-9 solid hours for the average person, if not more to complete the game entirely. Honestly, I have never played a game where you do so much and progress so far in what in retrospect does not seem to have been that much time. It's just that at the end you're left wanting more. Which is fine, I guess - replaying the game is a sweet deal!If I had my way, this game would be heralded as a hallmark of the 2D platformer genre because of how well it has been made. It's an absolute masterpiece. I would have no problem calling Metro-vania-style games Blind Forest-style games after playing it. That's how good this game is for me. It's so good that it makes me crave more - which is really hard to do!Glowing recommendation from me. If you like 2D platformers with fast, smooth action with the best visuals and accompanying soundtrack an indie developer can muster, this game is for you.And Ori is the most adorable little HNNNNGGGGGG WANT TO HUG SO BAD!!!"

The art and music are a pleasure. The controls are responsive. There are new challenges around every corner and they are never frustrating. Level design is an invitation to move and respond fast. I wished it were more difficult; don't get me wrong because it is not easy but the game is so free-flowing and rewarding that it leaves you looking for more. That is only downside; it ends.There is a story, and don't let the fact that this is a 2D platformer fool you that it is your standard save-the-princess or save-the-forest-friends or find-the-item-that-will-save-the-universe. The story is simple and revolves around a powerful theme of a mother's love and sacrifice. It is told in short scenes that are accompanied by a heartfelt and moving soundtrack.This is one of the best games that I have ever played and I enjoyed it more than many AAA titles on my GTX 780 Ti, 32 gb rig.Finally I would express my thanks to the inspired team behind this project and tell them that I wish there were more of you in the industry."

What can I say ?It is extremely beautiful, with great OST, platform genre.Some parts are hard, very hard. That is not a cute game for children. It's a game for skilled players, or casual who looks for a bit of challenge (like me).There's a part that is torture for casuals, without spoiling I'll say ""water rising"". It is really hard and skill challenging, but don't give up, this is by far the hardest part of the game. On a scale to ten, if this part is 10, the next hardest thing is around 6. So don't give up at this part, this will give you great and usueful skills, and the rest of the game is worth it.This game is worth 12 hours of playing if you want to collect everything. However no replayability, once the game is cleared, your save is locked, you have to start a completely new one, nothing like ""new game +"".Even with this, I've had my content of fun, challenge, enchantment, poetry, and amazement.

However, the story is moderate, but definitely not worse than any other game story that gets out nowadays. It's told in a good way and sometimes gets you right in the feelzz.The only disappointment is the length of the game, I really hoped I'd get more than 11.5 h out of it. And there's no way to continue after end-game, looking for upgrades that you missed. It's like the Metroid games where you have a small window where you can explore everything and get 100% and if you miss it, there is no going back.That's probably why I like this game so much, it's a lot like Metroid.

Everytime I was about to break, or finally get some sleep the amazing story just drew me right back in, and continued to do so even after I completed it for the first time, which took about 7 hours. After my first completion I immediately did an entire second and 3rd playthrough all within 2 days of each other and the game was just as good as it was the first time through.I would have been willing to pay 60$ or even more for this masterpiece, it was just that good, so for 20$ this game is EASILY worth picking up, even if platformers aren't usually your thing.

Unless you have the one and only special-snowflake kind of controller the game was made for, it doesn't work. Even the usual workarounds for this problem are thoroughly broken. The developers don't seem to have any plans to fix this glaring error, ever.-The mouse+keyboard controls of this game are okay, but appear to have been designed for someone with either three hands or twelve fingers.-This game is exceptionally laggy at times, and the cutscenes only sort of work, occasionally freezing or skipping over parts to continue playing.-This game's story isn't very good. It suffers from an overabundance of pathos and otherwise is rock simple.-This game commits the two major cardinal sins of overall design that any otherwise fun-to-play metroidvania could possibly commit: there are missable upgrades, and there are upgrades after a point of no return.-This game has no bosses; instead it has sections where you have to run away from instant death walls. This was a bad decision. Why is there an awesome-looking gigantic owl monster in your game and I don't even get to fight it?All of that being said, this is a fun game to play. Despite control issues, it has a nice, frenetic sort of platforming and fighting. It has decent puzzles and mostly non-cheap ways of hiding upgrades for the player to find them, and there are a lot of cool sections to level design. The atmosphere and graphics are good; the music is good for what it is.Overall, if you're looking at the screenshots and think you want it, and if you can put up with the issues I've listed above for an otherwise good game, you should get it."

The skills you learn are pretty interesting and some of them take some practice but you get the hang of it after dying 100 times haha (ahm ahm).

One of the best games I've played, and almost definitely the best 2D platformer. Gorgeous artwork, with excellent use of layering for extra depth. Beautiful, fluid animations and tight controls (played with an Xbox One controller) give a great sense of agility. Satisfying difficulty curve and well balanced upgrade system. And a fantastic musical score. Highly, highly recommended."

In all the game took me around 16 hours to beat but is well worth the price of admission. The game is gorgeous with excellent music to match. The story and characters are very much influenced by Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and many others) so if you like those films you'll love this game.While the game is a work of art in and of itself there's a couple things that keep it from attaining perfection. For as much detail and thoughtfulness that went into the game it's suprising and puzzling that there is no fast travel. My only conjecture would be that they place such a high value on the work of the artists that they insisted on leaving it out. In a game like this where several zones comprise a giant hole fast travel would make this game so much easier to navigate. If you're a completionist then prepare for a lot of running back and forth from new to older levels.The second is the fact that one zone - the Forlorn Ruins - becomes sealed off for the rest of the game once you get to a certain point. This comes nearly 80% of the way through the game and it's the only ""outdoor"" zone that does this. This is unfortunate because the game doesn't really do this to you until this point. Anyone who had taken the time to grab as many items as they could before entering this zone will be sorely disappointed if they don't explore every inch of this place before getting to the point of no return.Neither of those issues however, is enough to tarnish its recommendation. It simply tarnishes what is otherwise a nearly perfect game. Everything else in the game is as good as you'd expect from a top quality platformer when it comes to controls and design.  I also found the challenge to be spot on. It was challenging enough to keep me engaged but not so much to be overly frustrating.There is no multiplayer nor is there any other game modes besides the single-player campaign. There are also no difficulty levels so once you're done that's it. But I'm fine with that. It's a strong enough game that it can stand tall on its own without anything else tacked on.Overall I'd give it a 9/10. There's a lot of love that went into this game and it clearly shows and is a worthwhile purchase at full price and a complete no brainer if on sale. If you enjoy this genre you will not be disappointed.--The short version:It's a metroid-vania / puzzle platformer. If you enjoy that genre then buy this game. Now.If you're a completionist take note that the Forlorn Ruins (along with each ""inside"" zone but that at least is a bit more obvious) has a point of no return. If you do not 100% this area before reaching it you will not be able to revisit it later and will not be able to 100% the game without applying a 3rd party fix (which there is! Somone wrote a powershell script to enable fast travel so you can revisit the area!) but why bother if you don't really have to? :)Also worth noting is that you should never save your game while crouching. It's a weird thing to mention but apparently there's a bug where if you do so you'll be very limited (can't jump if I recall correctly) and you'll have to start your game over from the very beginning."

A good use of music and graphics, this masterpiece expresses an amazing story carried out by terrific mechanics. Despite failing to live ~400-500 times, I experienced no frustration; respawning was immediate, flawless, and had a nice touch of not resetting the music. Speaking of which, the music was great, something that is currently stuck in my head—and among the first of all the music I’ve heard to not want to get out. The story is sad, touching, and happy altogether. The creators also had a really good job of spiking my adrenaline whenever a fast-paced event occurred. Finally, in my opinion, I think the entirety of the game resembled a Hayao Miyazaki-style work (and I love Miyazaki’s work), which brought the nice theme that made me love this game so much that I just had to write a review for it.

Ori does that perfectly, I have laughed and cried and genuinely felt challenged as the game has progressed. Certain parts felt impossible for a good 5 minutes, but the controls and game itself are both so fair that perserverance never lead to frustration.The mechanics are to die for, which I know has been mentioned- but seriously, such a frantic and awe-inspiring game has never been less slippery. I can't possible communicate how satisfying the game becomes time and time again- just when you thought you had it all it gives you something advantageous and life is great and then moments later it becomes clear why you require that mechanic to survive. I've never been so impressed at how well character evolution and AI and Environment evolution synchronize, it feels like the old metroid games except you're a lilo and stitch experiment and YOU LITERALLY HAVE NAVI, its got to be in my top 3 of all time and I recommend it to everyone.Feels ever so slightly like Metroid Zero/Metroid Fusion for the GBA, like a little bit.I have no problems with it whatsoever (but dont alt tab while the game is open or it will crash, not anything to do with the game so it doesnt detract), and I would love to see  a sequel. I give it a 10/10, because I could not fathom it being better, feels like the perfect distraction from all the realism in games these days.Game time is a little bit off as it has been left paused for perhaps 4-6 hours of play, while I've taken short breaks here and there- but both myself and girlfriend have been playing it, and theres a tonne more to accomplish, and I'll definitely be going for achievements on this masterpiece of a game."

All of the colors just pop out and enhance the different atmospheres within each of the stages. The soundtrack was incredibly well done with each soundtrack complenting each of the different areas along with the cutscenes. I enjoyed the soundtrack so much that I just had to buy it and listen to it whenever I wanted to.This game is by all means a platformer but mixes in combat and puzzles to enchance the platform mechanics. The combat and puzzles work extremely well with the platformer mechanics. This made the game interesting and gave a breath of fresh air into platformers. The story is simple but enough to keep you engaged and makes you want to find out what happens next. What really made the game great was the fact there were no tutorials! I find games now a days just basically tell you how to solve something rather than letting the player figure it out.  It was a great feeling solving puzzles which didnt have a voice/text saying ""Solve puzzle like this"" or ""perform this action to achieve 'x' result"" as a massive hint.Overall I would recommend this game just based on how it looks and how great the gameplay is.

I like D-pads for games, which this would benefit GREATLY from, but the 360 D-pad isnt' my cup of tea. 3, There's a lot more in the air movements, which makes the flow really distinct.One gripe is that there are missable collectibles due to the game locking you out of certain areas when you finish them, and once you beat it, you can't just wander around again post game.One good thing I enjoyed is that it felt harder to me than other games of the genre I've played.TLDR: Good game, though not perfect.

The gameplay, while extremely fluid, is relatively simple and becomes increasingly predictable after obtaining the dash ability. The metroidvania elements are weak, with exploration rewarding health (which is made increasingly redudant as more and more ways to die instantly are introduces), energy (equally redundant, you'll have more than enough for a save point before and after every minor segment) or ability points (for the RPG elements; I imagine most players will aim firstly for the triple jump and ignore the other trees). The world lacks any sort of interconnection, and it's a chore to make way from one side of the expansive (for better or worse) map to the other. The story shoots itself in the foot fairly hard around the end, which dissolved what remained of my interest in it after the basic premise of ""collect the three plot devices"".Still, credit where credit is due. It's an absolutely gorgeous game, graphically. It's just the right length for its content. The difficulty curves perfectly, peaking at a comfortable if punishing level of challenge that makes the later areas rather satisfying to complete. I'm also extremely impressed with how the ""cinematic"" sections were handled, they were ultimately some of the hardest parts of the game and served as both intense and tasking. It doesn't do anything outright poorly, there's just a lot of things that it doesn't do too well.Worth playing, and worth the time it will take to finish.

,Recommended,261570,15479788,"Posted: 21 April, 2015",all,Heavenly Brush,"Combining a rather unique Japanese inspired aesthetic with a familiar genre of metroidvania and fast paced mobility based gameplay, Ori and the blind forest creates a very rare game, the one you simply have to experience.Ori and the blind forest tells a touching story of an orphaned tree spirit given a bigger purpose in restoring the dying forest back to life. Using the hero's journey template and a couple of nice additions of their own, Moon studios manage to deliver a deeply touching story while also resolving all the presented conflicts and ending the game with a very satisfying conclusion.The game looks stunning, every level presents a unique theme and pallet which keeps the game fresh. Animation quality for Ori is incredible, i absolutely love the twirl when you jump of a wall and front flip after a running jump. Graphics quality is very high and the game uses the engine to it's fullest. However on the technical side there are reports of slowdown and frame rate issues, despite that i was able to run Ori on my lover end laptop with 60 fps on a lover resolution so the problems should be fixable by just tinkering with the settings.Music and sound design create the needed atmosphere in every level. Music tracks fit their respective areas really well and at certain points help deliver the story. One of my personal favorites is ginso tree track with a looped raising bass line reflecting the climb to the treetop as well as first major challenge Ori faces.The sound and feeling of dread Kuro creates is a testament to how you can make an antagonist really scary purely with sound, and a couple really good camera angles, seriously Kuro, get out of my face, you're really scary.Gameplay is fast paced and centered around Ori's very swift and agile movements. As you unlock new moves the skill ceiling just keeps going higher and higher allowing crazier and crazier movements and certain parts of the game can be beaten without ever touching the ground.Boss fights are swapped for ""escape sequences"" - tightly timed puzzles that require you to use your mobility to the limit. Ori is not an easy game, but i never got frustrated because the game controls really well and lets you save at almost any point so it's really hard to justify blaming the game or even just getting frustrated.There is of course a metroidvania part, with a big map and lots and lots of secrets hidden all over the place, searching for hidden places and fake walls is as fun as traversing the levels since most secrets will have some sort of a movement puzzle leading to them. You also won't need to backtrack as much since game gives you quite a lot of shortcuts you can open to just breeze through the levels.You can have all the mobility in the world but if level design is lacking it will be meaningless. First levels of the game have to be more simplistic since Ori has less movement options but it will make backtracking through those levels kinda boring. Luckily Moon studios found an elegant solution. As the game progresses and Ori unlocks new moves the forest changes opening new movement options in the older levels.I've been praising this game for quite some time, but it doesn't mean there is no room for improvement.The game is really short, while it's completely justified by the game's budget and price tag ultimately i really wish there was more of it.Music can be a little bland at times. Level design is great overall but certain levels are worse than the others and can be improved upon.Escape sequences are amazing and i feel there should've been at least one more in the very end.But all of this are minor complaints that take almost nothing from the overall quality of the game.I really want a sequel for this game. You may wonder why? The gameplay is just THAT good, i feel we need more of the cool escape parts, more flying through the levels using all the sick moves, more hide from Kuro, And i believe, that with bigger budget and more time on their hands, Moon studios can deliver even better Ori game. We NEED more of this.Oh, and if you need a score - 98/100."

,Recommended,261570,16666486,"Posted: 23 June, 2015",all,Gene Parmesan,"Man this game is good. Real good. It's got great music, and the visuals are stunning. It's a platformer that tells a story you can actually kind of give a crap about. That's because it takes the smart path of telling you just enough. It doesn't try to beat you over the head with some obtuse tales; instead it introduces you to a few characters that you'll care about by the end of the game as you see them change.Even after all the artsy fartsy stuff, this game is a solid platformer. In a game about a rabbit thingy that you think would be a cake-walk, there were numerous intense platforming sections that I failed at over and over. Not because of bad design. Actually the opposite: the levels are very well designed, they just expect a lot from the player. For a game that looks casual, I can imagine some casual gamers, or at least those not into platformers, might feel it a bit too difficult.The one thing that made me nervous was the auto-aim. I was afriad at first that it would make killing enemies too easy. However, the game makes up for this because enemies have EXTREMELY GOOD aim. If you're next to an enemy that can shoot and you sit still for even a second or two, you're going to be dead. Beacuse of this and the auto-aim, areas with multiple enemies can feel a bit like mini bullet-hell levels, where you momentarily focus only on projectiles and dogding them while continuing to mash the fire button.All in all, this game is super solid. I'd say the only people who shouldn't play it are people who completely hate platforming games or are exceptionally bad at them. I took about 8 hours to finish, but if you really speed through, you could probably finish it in 6ish hours."

I want to like it sooo bad but . . . . . there are occasional areas of the game that are just way to difficult and unforgiving. No chances to recover from a small screw-up, no redemption, one small mistake and you are toast. I personally hate it when platformers force you to muscle-memory through a given level. I don't consider that good gameplay. There should be still room for some kind of choice. In Ori, in the aforementioned occasions, there is none of that. You will be frustrated and occasionally angry. If you are a casual player with little time to play at your disposal, you will end up wasting it trying to memorize the hardest levels and the finger choreography they take to beat them instead of enjoying fun gameplay. Only recommended to HARD CORE PLAYERS with plenty of time at their disposal!!!!"

I haven't finished it yet, but I'm overjoyed by the art style both in graphics and the interactive music that change depending on what you do, making you feel like you're in a dream. It sound like a mix of classical, celtic, oriental and ancient tribes all at once.The first minutes I started playing, it reminded me of the mobile game God of Light, which shared similar visuals and, If you're familiar with Zelda Twilight princess, you'll notice your companion's voice and speech sound exactly like Midna's. Quite some nice personal touches and made me want to dig more what the overall has to offer.It's an action/platforming type of game with a huge explorating set.There's a bunch of secrets for you to find and some amazing Easter Egg: (I.e. After climbing the highest mountain of the game, I tried to go further than I could and got pulverized by God's Lightning. Another beautiful effect.)The more you progress, the more difficult and tricky the puzzles and enemies become. Some require you to activate switches, other require you to use the enemies weapons against them or the environement. From time to time, there's a huge increase in difficulty for special events like escaping the Elemental's Ruins. It's a set of trial and errors. You won't get it the first time until you memorise the pattern and what's coming next, but even when you fail, the level design, the moving backgrounds both in front of the screen and back, plus the awesome sountrack playing during those escape make you forget your frustration and just push you to try harder.(So far, it took me around 12 tries to escape the Water Ruin and about 5 for the Wind)This game is worth every penny and I'm looking foward for more from Moon Studio after this masterpiece."

In the same way you can rewatch cutscenes you should be able to replay the main ""missions"" in a selective screen, this is a pretty basic option in most modern games today so sucks that it's not there.Also on a sidenote if there was some multiplayer option perhaps racing or battling while dashing around etc I would play the hell out of it because it was so much fun, so maybe something to consider in the future?Overall a very beautiful game/music I much enjoyed but it is lacking in cotent so will be over quick and no strong reason to replay."

Through my first playthrough of the game, I couldn't stop looking around. Whether it was the backround or the secrets I just wanted to see everything. Nothing look bleak or bland. As for the character designs, Ori is by far my favorite in the game. He is very adorable. Naru was a bit off putting to me at first, but it grew on me. Kuro is very menacing for an owl and Gumo was just strange to me. But enough about graphics, on to the gameplay.Ori and the Blind Forest at heart is a platformer, and it is very solid at that. Tight and responsive controls make the game feel natural. Often compared to a Metriod-vania, Ori is similar in the sense that you backtrack and can fight. The combat in the game is very low focused as there is not much depth to it. Shoot enemies, blast them, reflect, ground pound. However it makes up for this with its exploration. Ori has a lot of secrets and life/energy power-ups that can't be obtained on the first visit at a location. World Events (story progession points) must occur to open up new paths, and allow passage to the secrets from before. However this is not the case in some parts of the game specificly: Ginso Tree, Foreloin Ruins, and Mt. Horu. So you completionists (me included) beware, this will cost you another playthrough (not that it's bad). Another part of the gameplay is the skill tree. Through experience points you can obtain upgrades to combat, exploration, and survival (the three branches of the skill tree). Although not necessary to complete the game, they are very useful, my favorite being the triple jump skill.The story may be shallow at first glance, but if you think about it, it is a story of how blind creatures (humans) can be. In this forest the lived a great tree that brought life to the land, as well as the creatures that Ori is. Ori is taken away by a storm one night, to a place in the forest where Naru is. Naru finds Ori and takes Ori in as her own. Naru nurtures and cares deeply for Ori until the forest started to die and the food was almost gone. Naru dies of starvation giving the last of the food to Ori, leaving Ori as an orphan. Nowhere to go Ori begins a journey (the game). Later in the story you learn that the light of the great tree was taken by an owl, Kuro, because it had killed her children, leaving only an egg (because it's protected by its shell), so in return Kuro destroyed the forest. Through Ori's journey you become friends with Gumo, the last survivor of the Gumos. Inspired by Ori Gumo revives Naru with the light that protected the Gumos. At the final confrontation Ori is beaten by Kuro and the forest set ablaze. Only through Naru's love for Ori, Kuro has realized what she has done. Kuro was blinded by hatred and pain that she forgot all about others and their families, much like many of the people today. In the end Kuro sacrifices herself to undo the wrongs she has committed, restoring peace to the forest. In a happy ending we see that Naru, Ori, Gumo, and Kuro's Egg, are all living with each other as a family, regardless of their species and past (something humans should learn to do).Wrapping up this review, Ori and the Blind Forest is a worthwhile game and is more enjoyable than most AAA titles we see today. I highly recommend this game, even at full price."

Not enough praise can be given to this masterpiece by Moon Studios.The puzzles were always exciting and fresh, especially late in the game when you have all of the abilties at your disposal. The map is a joy to explore, with plenty of different areas to keep things interesting. I particularly enjoyed the Forbidden Ruins and the mechanic it focused on. Making it through a difficult part was always rewarding, and there were plenty of places I struggled with for a while. The controls were tight, which is good because there's a whole lot of jumping on enemies from platform to platform. There never was a part in the game that I felt was unfair. The story, conveyed mostly through text and cutscenes, consistently tugged at my emotions.I can't wait to play through it again."

I was looking for ""cheap"" full controller couch platformer, and boy did this deliver.I admit nothing of tears for first 10 or so minutes of getting into the game. After that I spent a good while just jumping around trying to break animations - never managed. Instead level of detail in minor things like timing your jumps right makes your glowy fox thing spin off to next jump.. Yeah, details.Game world, background, foreground.. Gorgeus. Foreground shadows moving gave me shivers.. Style reminds me of Trines' except slightly less colourful - bright, (mostly) easy to recognize enviromental hazards and enemies with proper contrast on dark 'ground', atmosphere in tons. One of the better soundtracks I've heard in games for very long time, guess previousAnd this game really doesn't hold your hand through it. Only very few checkpoints with autosave - otherwise you'll have to pick a spot to save and use your energy for it. Wander too far without another save and swear when you've got to do it all again. Jumping puzzles are unforgiving. Miss a jump - you're dead. Don't move fast enough - you're dead. Try to move faster and miss the jump - you're very dead. Becomes a con at a part where you have to escape from water up the level. That's few minutes jumping, no pauses, no places to save on the way. Missing last jump is a rage worthy.But same mechanics are used so well; after acquiring the skill you can pause time briefly to jump off enemy projectiles, or even enemies, bouncing them to opposite direction. Sometimes you're required to do it, sometimes it gets you up to secret spots - both cases you'll feel very proud of yourself for managing 10+ jump combo without killing the monsters required to keep jumping. Good timing and aim you can kill nasty strong monsters by kicking them into water or spikes.So looking for something pretty to play on couch with a controller? Grab this one. Sit back, maybe have a drink, and enjoy."

Ori is one of the most charming and beautiful games of any genre that I've ever played. It supports the argument for ""video games as art"" and is a lot of fun to play.Update: Finished the game in about 10 hours of binge playing. This game is easy to binge on. The Metroid and Rayman comparisons in other reviews are well deserved. To borrow from James Franco: If Metroid and Lion King had a baby, and Rayman and Lilo & Stitch had a baby, and if through some miracle, those two babies met and f*****, this would be their offspring.In addition to the really beautiful artwork, great soundtrack and satisfying gameplay, this game has more heartfelt emotion than all the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Twilight movies combined, which isn't really saying much but I think a fair amount of people will get a little choked up at some point while playing through this game. The ""villain"" is simple yet very menacing, and the hero is well developed by the attention payed to Ori's movement and sounds. He/she moves like a baby animal and squeeks like baby animal, but after about 2/3 of the game, Ori packs a satisfying wallop in combat and has a fun bag of tricks when it comes to jumping/sailing or just running around the forest. Some of the additional characters could have been more developed and the backstory, while it successfully drives the plot, left me wanting more. At least the story doesn't stray from the main narrative. I also would have liked a greater variety of enemies, instead of just changing the colors and type of attack for the 7 or 8 primary types of enemy you encounter but, again, the game was still a lot of fun and the main story was very well told.Overall:Pretty fun to playIncredibly beautifulGood storyWorth the money"

Combine all 3 and you have a fantastic game that tells it's story through maybe 30 sentences throughout your playthrough.There are a couple things I can think of that the game could have improved on, the major one being overall length. For $13 during the sale, you get around 3 hours for running through the main story with no attempt to explore, and around 6-10 of exploration amassing to around 6-8 hours of playtime for the average player. There are some small tech issues for opening and closing the game for most people as well, but they're largely irrelevant and not worth hurting the overall score of the game over.The game is a ton of fun, and i absolutely recommend it to anyone who hasn't picked it up on sale yet. but if you're tight on money, it may be worth investing in something with a little more longevity to it."

I'm a sucker for glowy stuff, and having a glowy main character who leaves a glowy trail, surrounded by other glowy things, is basically the videogame I've always wanted aesthetically. I'm not a big fan of the music - i.e. I wouldn't listen to it out of the game - but it fits the atmosphere very nicely.Pros:-Wonderful aesthetic-Great platforming-Good atmosphere-Gets a lot more fun once you get a certain powerup in my opinionCons:-Could be considered too hard at the start at least - induced rage multiple times-Sometimes hard to see your character-Sometimes not clear on where to goYeah, I found this game veeery hard at the start. The combat picks up a lot more around the middle, which is the point at which I'm writing the review. Enemies are tough and do lots of damage, there are a few sudden bossfights and you don't have many useful abilities. One particular thing I disliked was the poisonous water - falling in it was almost always an instadeath. But I just got past the (spoilering basically anything even remotely spoilery)water treeand got thedash attack thing, which you are able to use to jump off enemies, a la Dust: An Elysian tailand theground poundwhich make the fighting hugely smooth. By the way, anyone who loved Dust: An Elysian tail, GET THIS GAME. It's quite similar in many ways, e.g. beautiful art style and flowing combat once you're pastthe first tree. I also got lost a few times in areas where I wasn't meant to be yet, fighting incredibly strong enemies and getting frustrated. I looked up a walkthrough and realised I was in the wrong areas, but it was still pretty annoying. All in all, however, I would recommend this, at the moment at least. If it gets worse again - as I doubt it will - I may not recommend it for people who get easily frustrated, myself for example, but if you don't mind dying a LOT, get it!"

I didn't go for them all in one playthrough, I wanted to get them after I finished the game.The problem is, you can't play a completed gameOnce you beat the game, that's it, you can't re-enter the save to get all the collectables, your just get a fancy icon for winning on the save slot.  This really annoyed me, especially since I am a completionist at these games.  You have to do it all in one save, or restart the entire game because you missed one health upgrade for the achievement.If your not a completionist and love platformers, it's probably the best platformer made, and you need to purchase it.  If you are, I'd still reccommend it, just be careful you don't mss anything"

At first I didn't understand the hype.  After playing for a few hours I did.  There is an awful lot of ""great"" in the game and it will certainly.Cons:  Approaching a story sequence location while exploring can cause the story to progress, blocking off large chunks of the map that you are never able to return to again to finish exploring.  I thought this was frusterating because you will definitely miss areas of the game unless you have played it before and know where not to go until you have explored everything else.  Bad design choices.All in all, the great aspects of the game far outweigh the few bad bits.  If you're into platfroming, this game is excellent!"

The sound and music is simply spot on, and provides a serene, mysterious atmosphere that absorbs the player into a whole new world. The controls, are a bit wonky, and take some time to master, however the the puzzles and obstacles are fair, intruiging, and overall extremely enthralling to solve, the story fluid and almost cliffhanger esque, simply giving one inch of what actually is going on at a time as the player attempts to delve into what is actually going on.

The introduction is intensely moving and the art is stunning. There are some difficult sections and although you can overcome most of them with a bit of powerup backtracking to get more health it is still a satisfyingly challenging game. The save mechanic is ingenious but is completely up to you. There are checkpoints but they are few and far between however the ability to generate a save point anywhere using part of a special meter which also unlocks certain doors is very clever (in the early game at least, once you have maxed this guage you will never run into the ""do i save now vs. open this door"" decision). Fundementally it is a metroidvania style gated progress game. There is backtracking but the more you progress/unlock abilities the faster you will move through the environments so this is rarely a chore. For those who want to collect everything be aware that each of the elemental temples will permanently shut after you leave it so collect everything within them before you retrieve the stones at the end of them. I played for 10 hours at least which was a pretty thorough playthrough but I feel this was a good length and the game did not outstay its welcome.

I think those sequences, although *really* freaking difficult, add a good balance of calm moments and ""holy #$%$#$%&#%$#@$"" moments (which can also be rage-inducing, but worth it in the end). Also, considering that there aren't really any big boss battles where you're fighting off some huge monster - these running sequences are the boss battles, and are probably crazy difficult for that reason.I definitely recommend this one - check it out if you like challenging platformers, and really pretty games with feels. :)"

The soundtrack was excellent, though some of seemed close to copyright infringement on the works of Joe Hisaishi. The graphics are brilliant, colorful, and smooth as silk. The gameplay is best with a controller (just buy a receiver if you've already got an Xbox controller) and very challenging at times. You may spend 45 minutes trying to play through a 2 minute timed sequence, but it is so well scripted that you won't feel like throwing your controller after dying for the 20th time.

This game is a perfect lesson of trial and error, as you will constantly die, especially during the escape scenes, each having their own new mechanics acquried beforehand to add variety to the gameplay.  Leveling up abilities doesn't really make gameplay any easier, so Ori and the Blind Forest serves to be a very challenging platformer that compliments the storyline well.

Just peep one of the preview videos to get an idea. It has a relatively timeless, color-drenched style that I think will hold up very well over time.Broadly the game falls into the so-called ""Metroidvania"" genre where you explore an ever-growing game world while constantly finding upgrades and steadily growing your arsenal and mobility. It's as fine an example as any game in the genre. The world is large and fun to explore, but not too big to lose track of.The music, gameplay design, cutscenes, and pacing of the game are all admirably consistent and it's very clear that it's the product of a strong creative vision executed flawlessly. I finished it in 9 or 10 hours and it's a treat the entire way - no half-baked portions or dull plods. It lasts as long as it needs to and finishes great. Every ounce of it is pulled off perfectly without any seams showing.The only thing I would caution you about before you buy it is that it's more challenging than it appears at first glance. There aren't any difficulty levels so there's no way to put it on easy and stroll through the game to see the content if that's what you're used to. It's never patently unfair but you'll need decent twitch skills and some persistence to get through some of the trickier portions. If you die, respawning is super quick, and in the process of dying the game teaches you how to get good at it. Stick with it a little bit (and use a good controller) and I think you'll be surprised at what you can pull off.I'm deliberately avoiding talking about the plot or gameplay specifics because I think those are best experienced with as little foreknowledge as possible, but I can't recommend this game enough. Check it out!"

Eighteen years ago, I was a metroidvania expert now those days are over!

Hard to fault, I was hooked, but it was the escape from the Ginso tree that blew me away and prompted the review.

(Feel free to listen and/or download the trailer themes released on the composer's SoundCloud):https://soundcloud.com/garethcoker/ori-and-the-blind-forest-e3-trailerhttps://soundcloud.com/garethcoker/ori-and-the-blind-forest-launch-trailerCapable of providing a great challenge, an engaging story, a great deal to explore that navigating is never too difficult,Ori & The Blind Forestis perhaps one of the most recommendable games I have seen in a fair while, and one that'll remain in memory fondly.Highly recommended using a GamePad as your input. The game supports Keyboard & Keyboard & Mouse, but unfortunately limits itself to QWERTY & AZERTY presets, with no rebindable keys in or out of the game.Despite running very well in my case & not been particularly demanding, Dean Dodrill'sDust: An Elysian Tailremains to be outdone as the best PC port of a Microsoft Studio game.My ReviewFrom the very outset, Moon Studios emotionally grips with an outstanding prologue (Which their trailers were far too keen to try to spoil), then you are thrown into the gameplay and on a emotionally rich adventure.The story is something I would consider to be very emotionally driven, as well as being probably the game's only notable weakness. To explain why would be a disservice to those whom have not yet had the fortune to play this game, so I'll leave that particular mystery to be solved by yourself (Or even find it's just me). As for the characters, their visual design alone makes them difficult to not fall in love with, with their unique animations & highly expressive faces enough to convey their powerful emotion & charm alone with great effectiveness, with only a particular set of characters with any words to provide.But whatever the weaknesses, it remains strongest where it matters most; the gameplay. Although more tributary & iterative of the Metroidvania genre, it is one that provides a great deal of accessibility & ease of navigation without the fear of giving you a fair number of challenges to conquer.Even though not being one for 2D platformers, even in my youth just before they made the leap to 3D, it was remarkably distinctive to the Metroidvania design it was so keen to pay tribute to, keenly reminding me of my experiences with the likes ofMetroid Prime, and was also pretty astounding as to how beautifully it controlled for the most part (I say for the most part as early-game wall-climbing can be very tricky to pull off with precision due to requiring constant jump-button mashing to maintain a grip, especially when the game's pace skyrockets).Despite the 12-14hrs I spent with the game completing it to 100%, it's a game that paces itself remarkably well, never demanding too much of your time & giving you a good moment to close down for another time, but always ensuring that no moment is ever a dull one.VerdictI feel it's safe to say that whilst paying tribute to the timeless 2D platforming classics of the past, this one itself has gained itself the chance to become one along side them, with sublime visuals of a timeless quality, a soundtrack rich & raw with emotion, and gameplay & control that masters not only being accessible to many, but not afraid to make them earn their mastery of it.If you're looking for a good ol' 2D Platforming Adventure, you cannot go wrong with this one!"

I first heard of it when a random dude on the internet posted a video of gameplay-and the first thing I noticed was the soundtrack. Actually, that should be all the reason you need to get this game. Music here is absolutely amazing. I only regret not being a native english speaker and thus lacking the words to properly describe just how good it is. Not only does it sound beautiful, it also fits extremely well with the narrative and gameplay-both of which receive thumbs up from me. The story is touching and unique (won't spoil anything more), and gameplay is challenging without resorting to cheap mechanics and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t artificial difficulty. Moreover, I FEEL the effort that's gone into this game-I can only imagine how many hours devs must have spent creating a huge, basically free roam map, that is this well balanced and takes into account all of Ori's unlockable abilities without forcing too much backtracking. Then there's the graphics. While I prefer simpler, often times subdued visuals, this game left me in awe. Clever use of front and back planes and colour contrasts is not something you see often outside of art galleries. Eh, I could ramble for thousands more pages, so let me sum it up real quick.TL;DRGood-soundtrack, gameplay, soundtrack, story, soundtrack, graphics, soundtrack.Bad-can be at times confusing. Sometimes your attacks can obscure your enemies, making it difficult to adapt and dodge. Takes surprisingly a lot of CPU to run.Overall-GET IT NAO!!11"

I would like to share how I feel about this game though.It's amazing! I love this game so much I played it strait for 5 hours. The art style is unique and just breathtaking by itself. The scenery and work put into this game to make it a ""good game"" shows. I also find myself having a love for Ori because he is so dang cute. Example: when your swimming and Ori needs air, you surface to get some air and the little gasp Ori lets out just made me awe. The soundtrack fits the game but im not gonna focus on the soundtrack right now but the way the developer made it quiet in some parts of the game and cutscenes. No sound but complete and utter silence and it is perfect for the ambiance of the game.This game would get a 10/10 but it doesn't. I give it a 7/10 for two reasons. It might be my com. though i doubt it because it can take LoL, Team Fortress, and Heros of the Storm, but this game lags serverly at parts. Now the lag doesn't mess with the gameplay but it can get annoying at times. Playing in 1280-680 resolution can help with that problem though. The other thing is that the cutscenes have a bug. While watching the beautiful cutscene, sometimes it will flip upside down and back or will sometimes cut out completely, but come back. It seems like this game is doing whatever it can not to crash and that is not a bad thing, but it messes with the feeling i get from the game.All in all this is a great game that shows how video games can be fantastic works of art and shows that a game can be fun without blazing gunfire, war, and gore( those are fun though) but can be serene and beautiful and still be a blast!!!Recommended!!"

The boss fights are more like saveless areas where you have to escape moving death, and you'll feel like a million dollars when you do complete them.

I'd been sat on my bed, Xbox 360 controller in hand, but eyes petrify on the screen. The stress, relief, achievement and fatigue were real. Ori and the Blind Forest might well be the most beautiful 2D platformers I've ever seen, but its true brilliance lies in its ability to push you to the limit, very rarely going too far. You can always do better and the thrill when you do is immense.The setup, which I won't spoil, couldn't be sadder, made all the more emotional by the exquisite way the dev team at Moon Studios tells the tale. The gorgeous ethereal art and impeccable pacing combine to make the first sequence more memorable than entire games manage in tens of hours. The visual quality continues throughout, but the game quickly becomes a skill-based platformer that is as devious as it is good looking.Ori, a rabbit-like white spirit, initially has the most basic platforming moves, able to jump and perform weak attacks using companion Sein – a small blue light guide while he (I don't know his gender tough) wants to recover the forest back in the day while face the battle with kuro - huge owl that take the light out of the forest so that's why the title said ""blind forest"" I think.Many of skill could be optains in the game by attack the enemies so you get some light indicator to fulfills to gain skill point to unlock abilities to make the ori get strongger. But still even if he get stronger there are so many events or enemies that could kill you instantly. the forest itself apart to some kind of 3 dungeons and you must clear them until you get something light of balls or key to revive the forest to its former selfLAST:Ori and the blind forest stunningly gorgeous graphics game that ever created. The story itself is very very heartwarming, with the soundtrack that for me the best sountrack game in my life you will release all of your emotions into this - cry, sad, angry, warm. and the last the gameplay make some good point of challenge to take.11/10 for the story11/10 for the soundtrack10/10 for the gameplayTHEY DESERVE IT YOU KNOW"

76561198068660222,Recommended,261570,16834591,"Posted: 1 July, 2015",all,Aphid Junket,"Much like that game made by Studio Ghibli (pronounced Jibbly, I would like to believe) that felt like playing a Studio Jibbly film come to life; Ori and Blind Forest instantly draws you into its weird and wonderful little world populated by Japanese-cute characters being thrown into harrowing ordeals.If you are not moved towards some kind of salty eye duct discharge after the intro scenes conclude then I suggest calling the nearest butcher that does deliveries, and placing an order for a heart.After completing your surgery and getting back to playing this game for realz you will discover a very nice, perfectly functioning, platform-run-around-collectathon that provides all the usual suspects present in this genre since the dawn of time.  Including, but not limited to: jumping, wall-climbing, shooting balls of light at the evil, dark, spiky enemies, double-jumping, swimming, some kind of strange catapult-slingshoty manoeuvre that I think is called glamping (?), floor-slamming and towards the end: floating.  The folks who made this game know they’re not re-inventing Mario, but they are fully aware of what decides if a good platform game is good, which is, is it fun to play?  And in this regard (and it should be noted I was playing via a greasy old PS3 pad so I don't know what manner of finger contortion was required for the keyboard) platform fun was achieved!If you are like me and ever since your first foray into 2D side scrolling you enjoy a game that lets you get by on sheer spheres-to-the-wall luck, then O and the BF will hopefully be a nice step back in time.  You always seem to have a double-jump when you need it, the enemies feel suitably matched to each progression of Ori's abilities and clearing an area feels sufficiently worthwhile.Of course, the sense of accomplishment from successfully completing a tricky series of fiddly jumps can be lost when, unless you forgot, you can place a save point practically anywhere for little to no detriment.  In fact this is one of my few gripes with not just this game, but most games in general, which is as soon as you allow players to save at will you lose all concept of terror, the terror of failure.  It's an important aspect of video gaming that seems lost on the new generation.  I think I know the reasons for doing it, kids nowadays having attention spans as short as British summers and so on, but after the first few 'areas' of the Blind Forest I felt far too at ease with just diving into certain death to see if that was the right way to go, safe in the knowledge that 5 milliseconds later I could have another try with no harm done.  With this game, though, it's a minor gripe as death is common and that ability to retry a miss-timed leap practically instantly does allow the passage through difficult sequences to flow more smoothly.  Moving on...The music is really flipping good.The bit where the giant screeching owl is after you is really flipping good too.The story was predictable in a good way.To sum up, I would heartily recommend this game for anyone looking to spend 5-10 blissfully poignant hours in a world ruled by a huge tree with a deep voice and a strong dislike of owls."

Never in my life have I experienced emotions like this from all the games I've ever played. I literally cannot fault anything in this game - it is absolutely perfect.This is the first time a game has ever made me feel this way.

I mean it.The only reason I start of with my rating is because I think the game deserves it.Since I'm a huge fan of Metroidvanias, the game was a musthave to me. In my opinion, the game shines over everything else in this genre that has been released since my favourite game which is of course Super Metroid (I have to admit, Guacamelee and Dust were also pretty fun examples of the genre, but Ori is waaay better). There are many reasons why I believe it's perfect:1. The story and the overall writing of the game is brilliant. It does not force cliches too often, but at the same time touches you deep down in the stomach and heart. The way the few main protagonists are interwoven in the plot is just supreme.2. The game design is surely one of the best I've seen so far. The world you are about to discover in its marvellous anime/aquarel presentation, the plenty of colours that inanimate the world and with its the superfluid animations (top notch like in Rayman Legends) has the effect on you that you forget you are actually playing a game. It all just feels just a bit too natural... in a positive way, I mean! :)3. The world map has a lot to discover but doesn't force you to backtrack into regions farfar away multiple times. The different skill unlocks are perfectly placed so the player experiences a slow but exponential difficulty curve all the time. It's very rewarding solving the challenging trap/riddle/enemy combinations later on. This should comfort new players but also genre fans as well.4. The epic orchestral soundtrack (especially the game's main motif) and the synchro in the game's own fantasy language add alot to imersion. This is best played loud!5. The overall content of the game is exactly right as it is. The first runthrough I played took me about 8-9 hours, although I'll definitely go for the 100% (EDIT: I just saw this is nearly impossible ^^), which will lead to about 10-15 hours of playtime. It never gets tedious but offers enough development, so I was pretty happy to see the ending where it was set.All, in all, this is a gem of a game. Please get it and make sure to have time for longer sessions, because this product will encaptivate you, I promise."

If you played Rayman Legends/Origins, the controls are just as responsive if not more responive. The game looks amazing, the sound track is amazing, the gameplay is amazing. It's worth every penny. Just keep in mind there are no bosses (unless you count easy to kill tougher enemies bosses) and that the game is a bit short. 6-9 hours.-----------------------------------------------------------After just 100%ing the game pretty much by getting all the abilities from the ability tree and getting all soul and life cells as well as exploring each terrain until the meter was 100%, I had to write a review for this incredible game.First of all, I must tell you that I am an enormous fan of platformers. I enjoy them to no end. When I was told about this game and saw some gameplay, I was pursuaded to end up buying the game. I have no regrets with this purchase. This is one beautiful, perfectly built platformer with an amazing soundtrack and an interesting story to boot.If you've ever played the games Rayman Origins or Rayman Legends, the controls for movement are very similar in responsiveness. It's about as floaty too. Sadly, you'll not have any satisfaction for bosses of any kind as there isn't a single one in the game. The style of the game is much like Metriod with powerups and things to collect throughout a large map and as you unlock more abilities, the more you can obtain.I really should go into detail on how the game plays but... That literally will take forever to type. However along with the lack of bosses, the game is also pretty short, spanning from 6-9 hours depending if you go to try and get the collectables or not.Pros:Beautiful graphics.Amazing Soundtrack.Tight controls that are easy for anyone.Wonderful level design that never ends up being too hard if you save often.Cons:Short in terms of length.No bosses.Now don't get me wrong, not every game needs bosses.. but this game could have benefitted from it greatly. I think the bosses of this game are the ""Attempt to get out of the place that's trying to kill you"" since you can't save during those bits and they're pretty challenging, but come on. That can't be considered a boss. That's a chase. There's a difference.One other thing... the replayibility... it's a little disappointing. I mean, I got everything on my first run through.

The animation is top-notch, the levels are genuinely atmospheric and although they use many familiar mechanics the level designers never rely too long on any one trick, never letting you get bored. Very few parts feel redundant or unbalanced and consequently the pacing is great throughout the 8-10 hours you'll spend playing it.There are a few very difficult passages where you're not allowed to save until you complete the whole obstacle course, and they will require patience and training to get through, which could be annoying for some players (harder than Limbo, easier than the regular levels of Super Meat Boy). Another downside is that the game has little replaybility value, and you can't go back to explore and complete parts of levels you may have missed after you finish the main quest without starting a fresh save. I also encountered a minor video bug in the cutscenes, where the video is repeadedly flipped upside down fast for short periods of time.On the whole this is a very well-crafted game, absolutely worth it if you grab it on sale.

Some of the powers you unlock are obvious (double-jump and the like), but some are fairly novel and fun (the ""bash"" ability allowing you to launch yourself infinitely off of enemies and bullets). Has a gorgeous, natural/outdoors feel to it, and there's lots to explore.There's a story, and it feels like it's on the verge of intriguing, and wants to tug at heart-strings, but in the end it's really kind of bare-bones, and completely superfluous to the game. The heart-string-tugging bit is right at the beginning, before actual gameplay, so there's zero time to invest emotionally, and they switch to a cop-out ""twist"" later anyway so it feels kind of meaningless.And, some of the most intense levels get shut down afterward with no way to get back in, and yet contain items you could conceivably collect, so it's possible to be prevented from fully completing the game. I think the things you can get in such cases aren't actually tracked/trophied, but that doesn't really lessen the harm, to me.But the graphics, animation, gameplay mechanics, and challenge, are fantastic, so this game gets a big thumbs up from me."

Every frame is a work of art.- Superb sound design, with exquisite attention to auditory detail in all aspects.- Beautiful, emotional soundtrack. Compliments the tone and feel of each part of the game perfectly.- Gorgeously fluid and detailed animation. Makes you feel like you're flying through the world rather than running.- Some notably interesting abilities that are a fresh deviation from the usual platforming arsenal.- Skillfully integrated and intuitive save system compliments the games style perfectly.- Excellent game design. At no time is any one previous ability rendered useless by later ones.- Controls like a dream.- Difficulty is just right. It's challenging (sometime very) without feeling unfair. Learning curve is gradual and forgiving.- Charming, family friendly game without feeling dumbed down or deliberately cutesy.- Made me cry like a baby.~Cons (AKA Nitpicking)~- The game is on the short side. Expect 8-10 hours, though every moment it lasts is brilliant.- Little replay value. There's no New Game Plus feature or playable/unlockable post-game content.- There are a couple points-of-no-return throughout, making it difficult to clear 100% on your first run.- I can imagine trying to accomplish some feats late-game would be incredibly difficult with a keyboard.- Visual effects can become so bright and dazzling at times that you may lose track of your character for a second.- Left me with a crippling lonliness in my chest after the game was finished, realizing my adventures with Ori were over.If you enjoy Metrovania style games (2D, free exploration. action-platforming sidescrollers), and appreciate the unique, spirited artistic styles seen in such works as Spirited Away and within games like Okami, then you should love this game.  It's truly a breath of fresh air and a ray of light in the otherwise largely stagnant and blind game industry of today. Just be sure to play it with a PC compatible controller (which is really something you should consider investing in if you're doing PC gaming, anyway) to prevent mechanical control issues from staining the game experience.Ori and the Blind Forest is really best approached as an experience as opposed to a video game. If you view it as such, I feel you'll come away from it with the most wholesome, satisfied experience possible. Either way, it's  certainly not a game to let pass by."

While I appreciate similar painterly art styles such as Bastion, Child of Light and Braid I feel that Moon Studios have done an impeccable job in the Art Department.There are some grievances with regards to game design though. Without divulging spoilers of any kind I will simply say that some gameplay mechanics felt unnatural and required step by step operation, breaking my natural gameplay flow that should feature in all Metroidvania games, as opposed to the majority of the mechanics that are so well designed they flow wonderfully, whether on individual basis or a combination of mechanics. Also, it is frustrating to lock off a particular section of the game world from the player thus preventing them from going back, without prior warning/advice.I would rate this game 4 out 5 and can't wait to return to Moon Studios marvelous game world.

It draws you in immediately. The graphics...oh, my word. Absolutely stunning! Ori has the most beautifully crafted 2d graphics I have seen in a long time. I'd play the game just for that alone. Gameplay is deceptively simple. It is a platformer so its intuitive but that doesn't mean you won't be challenged. The muscial score is terrific as well. I definitely plan to purchase the soundtrack when I'm able. The storytelling in this game is a sheer delight. Okay, I know I'm gushing but I can't help it.

It employs an artistry and aesthetic with which few games I've played to date can compete. Its simple story is oddly touching, which is not something I typically expect from this genre. The gameplay has a rewarding progression, encourages some exploration and treasure finding, and often employs a satisfying momentum that the game's impressive musical score enhances to great effect. Execution becomes relatively unforgiving late game, but the high frequency of game saves allows for this difficulty without becoming overly frustrating, which is a welcome balance. I'd highly recommend this, even to those who, like myself, typically do not often enjoy platformers."

While no Super Meat Boy, this platformer can be brutally unforgiving and has no problem beating Ori, the small fluffy forest bunny/mouse/spirit-animal thing you play as, into a fine pulp. Repeatedly. You will rage. You will curse. You will wish painful and slow death and destruction upon every being and spiky object within the titular Blind Forest. And you won’t be able to stop playing.The reason for this isOri’simpeccable controls mechanics - the game just feels great to play! Not only does Ori always moves and jumps exactly how you intended in tight, visually pleasing animations, the game goes out of its way to keep you feeling calm and relaxed through its gorgeous artwork combined with a soothing soundtrack. This calm is sometimes broken by a voiceover that is about as subtle and welcome as a wakeup call via vuvuzela, but that’s my only (small) gripe with the game’s art direction.WhileOri and the Blind Forestdoes very little that’s unique for the genre, it is solidly designed, impeccably paced, and engaging throughout. New mechanics and abilities are introduced at just as you’re mastering the old ones and environments change and vary enough that you’re never left bored of the scenery. If you can overcome the occasional difficulty spike,Oriis definitely well worth your money and time if you are a fan of well-made platformers or looking for a fun way to spend a weekend. If you are looking for a game with a lot of replayability or a good combat system, this might not be the game for you. However, I would still recommend picking it up if you can get it cheap during a sale.Some other things:You’ll need a gamepad to play, as this game is a port from the Xbox OneIf you’re a completionist worrying about 100-percenting this game, never fear! Despite sounding challenging, all of the achievements inOriare straightforward and fair and can be done in 2-4 playthroughs without too much difficulty.Take advantage of the multiple save slots available to you. Some people have reported getting stuck in certain areas and having earlier saves around may save you some future grief."

Keeping it vague as not to spoil the story, on three occasions the player must try to outrun some form of impending doom through a ""metroid"" like escape sequence (except full of BULLS**T suprise ways to die) once a major objective is completed. It will be tough, it will be frustrating, it will suck and it will make you want to punch a baby. The level will be stacked against you and you will find it blatantly and excessively unfair, just like our judiciary system. HOWEVER, when you get through it, assuming there are computers in prison, you'll absolutely enjoy the game quite thoroughly untill the next said style of level, or untill ""Big-Richie"" comes looking for his coke.Overall: i'd call it a 9/10 with the only flaws being the above mentionned issue and the fact that you don't actually have Big-Richie's coke.I 100% recommend it.

The breathtaking scenery and epic music suck you in and make you feel emotionally attached to the plight of the forest and Ori and his loved ones. Exploring the forest, like you do in a Metroidvania, never feels like a chore because it is just captured so well. Fans of games that put atmosphere at the forefront will find a lot to love here. Even when you are dashing through peril you will wish you could slow down just to look at that beautiful flaming rock that is about to kill you because damn it just looks so good doing it.The game-play does not lag behind, however. The controls are tight, and that's good because this game is HARD. You never feel like you died (which you will) because of the controls. The areas are well-designed to take advantage of your steadily increasing skill-set, and retreading old areas always leads to new surprises as you will find you can reach new heights or depths. Especially fun are the quick-run areas which might kill you 20 times each, easily, but are loads of fun as they make you think on your feet and remember quickly and carefully what ability you should be using when.If you like well-designed platformers, atmospheric games, or fun-to-explore metroidvanias, this game is for you.

This is one of the best games I've ever played.I've never done a written review ever this game is so good that it made me do my first one.  Here goes.GAMEPLAY: The controls are really fluid.  Running and jumping around trying to reach new areas never gets old.  The map is huge and there are lots of areas to explore.  There are tons of abilities to unlock, each of which always has a direct use .  Not one of the abilities ever feels useless as they all have a direct useful impact on the gameplay immediately after it's unlocked; it makes you eager to get more ability points which in turn buys you more abilities.  And that's not counting the abilities you unlock simply by progressing through the game such as the Stomp move which breaks through unstable ground, and the Double Jump which can be upgraded to the Triple Jump.  The game is an absolute joy to play.   Enemies always remain challenging throughout the game and get more difficult as you progress.  There is never a point in the game where Ori seems too powerful even with all the abilities you unlock, it keeps you on your toes.SOUNDTRACK: I'm a huge soundtrack junkie and this game definitely gave me my fix.  The music is incredible.  I love when game developers know how important the music is when making a game,  From the intro song to the end credits I loved every second of the music which just got better and better.  It really helped drive the story along and added emotion to the cutscenes and gameplay.  There are several tracks that I can just lay down, close my eyes and throw on repeat.  I commend Moon Studios for that, I really do.VISUALS: This game's visuals are a masterful work of art.  Ori and the Blind Forest shows you that there's more to graphics than just Shiny 3D cutscenes.  The game looks so good that you could literally take a screenshot from anywhere in the game and have it be your desktop wallpaper.  It's truly poetry in motion.  There's so much attention to detail in the background AND foreground which both have their fair share of moving parts, it brings the whole world to life.  There's so much color, yet nothing ever seemed out of place, there's never a dull sight.  And the lighting on all the colorful orbs and pick ups add even more to it.  I couldn't help playing this on my 40 inch Samsung TV rather than my PC monitor every time I played.  It's truly a feast for the eyes.SCORE: 10/10I highly recommend buying this game.  To be honest its worth even more than the $20 asking price.  Moon Studios has put more thought and effort into this game than a lot of companies put into their AAA game titles.  The more people who play this game the better."

The plot was not wholly overwhelming for me, but appropriately emotional and very touching.  Gameplay is smooth and very adaptable. It has many intriguing mechanics which were unlocked at appropriate points. I didn’t ever feel too trapped or limited by what I could and could not do. Mostly they give you a very generous grace period to learn new mechanics. However, sometimes the game will force you to master them immediately. It can be a bit of a struggle at times, especially when those new mechanics are intertwined in a no-checkpoint escape scenario (looking at you, Ginso Tree).The game opts for three big ‘escape scenes’ rather than the overused boss fight. They were each challenging in their own way. The world/map design was invaluable, sprinkled with the right amount of power ups and bonus exp. I did some backtracking to 100% some areas, but it never felt too ‘grindy’. I was incredibly disappointed to find that one area was blocked off after completing it - so it was stuck at 98%. This is my one outstanding gripe about the game design. All areas should have the ability to be revisited. The leveling-up of abilities was a good addition, but didn’t strike me as particularly compelling. They featured good bonuses (like breathing underwater, triple jump, and pointing out things on the map), but not so important that you could easily go the entire game without investing a single point. The Save system can be particularly punishing, but not if you’re on top if it. I think it was well done. The music adds beautifully to the world and enhances every area. Hats off the the few, appropriately placed, Easter eggs.For a very unique world, refreshing platformer, and addictive gameplay, 9/10. An excellent triumph."

Welp here I am 9 hours later at 5 in the morning with the story beaten. To sum up my experience I've made a pro and con chart to help you understand if you should buy this game.Pros:-The sound track was amazing. It changed everywhere you went and flowed with everything you did.-The art was astonishing to say the least. From mushrooms to rams, all of it was detailed perfectly. Every new part of land you encountered changed colors vibrantly. All the things that you see in the game can, and will move in some way. Your actions, the AI actions and many objects all interact with the environment.-The game play was very smooth and very manageable. There were only a few times where I actually had to practice a new move they give to you. The controls were simple enough that my 5 year old sister could master them.-The map that they throw you into is giant. If i could compare this map to something I'd compare it to darksouls. Everyother path has a shortcut or a secret and the only way to get around is to walk there yourself.-The story was touching. I'm not going to give anything away, but i did shed a few tears here and there. Punched a shark after this game's credits to regan my manliness.-The fact that everything was so well done and everything had an animation got me thinking, ""uh oh, this is gonna lag so hard the whole game,"" but on the contrary, everything ran so well my frames didnt drop below 50 the entire time. My Laptop is not one to brag about and my graphics card can just about handle the medium settings on 8-bit games.- And finally, the amount of stuff you can do afterwards. I havn't done much yet because I was so preoccupied with the story, but I know for a fact I still have to max out my skill tree and get the rest of the power-ups.now for the cons:...I think I've made my point.This game is a must have for anyone any age, any size, any gender and I give it a straight up 10/10."

,Recommended,261570,21069046,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,LOG_arhythm,"This is a really great game, and I have the confidence to say that before even completing it. The controls are fluid and satisfying, the game design reminds me of this brilliant mash up of Donkey Kong Country, Metroid, most Mario games, and Rayman Origins/Legends. On top of all of that, the game is drop dead gorgeous, the story is engaging and heart wrenching, and the soundtrack is a great accompaniment to boot.However, as someone who plays platformers in such a systematic, calculated, completionist fashion, this game rubs me the wrong way in certain areas. For those who play games aiming to get 100% completion - especially in games that reward you greatly for doing so - be wary of Ori and the Blind Forest. There are giant sections of the overworld that you will be completely locked out of after completing certain parts of the story, and you are NOT warned when you are crossing these paths. I discovered this after quite a long time of rummaging through the map trying to 100% each section of the overworld, rendering all of that time useless.I understand that this game isn't just, ""Collect all the shiny things, get to the finish line, and gawk at your 100% completion,"" that's fantastic. In fact, I'm glad this game doesn't make that a priority. Any good platformer can be completed by picking up absolutely none of the secrets. BUT what this game DOES do is highly reward players who DO seek out every nook and cranny of the overworld for secrets. Why they decided to highly reward players only to reprimand them against their own will later on when missing ONE item in a later unreachable part of the overworld is beyond me.I can only assume they trap players like this in order to force them into replaying the game for achievements and for 100% completion. I hope that's not the case, but that's what it feels like. It makes an otherwise flawless game feel a bit more plastic.Long story short, if you are a fan of platformers, you absolutely must play Ori and the Blind Forest. Just try not to think about all of the pickups/secrets and just enjoy it for what it is, at least the first time through. Even though the secrets will be tantalizingly displayed on your map, resist wasting your time to get them if they're out of your way.I don't have the heart to give this game a thumbs down because of how jaw-droppingly awe inspired I've been during my first playthrough. I do, however, feel a little mislead. (And who am I kidding, I'm GONNA replay it anyway...)"

CheckPerfect length to tell the story and not drag on, but room to return for achievement completion if you want? CheckThe only thing I could remotely think to say is that if you aren't an avid platformer fan, there are a couple parts that will probably challenge you, but it's worth bucking up and overcoming them. Platformer veterans probably won't find Ori extremely challenging, but it has plenty of areas that you can't sleep through and the story and art are so engaging you won't even notice or mind if you're having an easy time with it.It's an amazing, beautiful game.

It's difficult to say anythin about the story without spoilers, but it starts out on a sad note.

If you have ever bought a game just because it looked gorgeous, you won't regret doing that again here.Visually, this is among the most beautiful games I have ever played. The art is just stunningly good. The music, the controls, and the overall gameplay are also top-notch, adding up to what I can only describe as a brilliant overall experience. The story is fine for what it is--simple, cute, heartwarming--but this is not a story-driven game, so don't expect much of a narrative.The game is overall pretty tough. It's not ""I Wanna Be the Guy"" difficulty or anything, but it's a legitimate challenge.I have one semi-complaint. The game does away with traditional boss fights (a good thing), and instead has extended chase sequences in the place where a boss fight would normally be (also good). The problem is that a good chase sequence is most thrilling when immersion is high--that is, when you're taken off-guard, need to improvise, and just barely squeak through the sudden challenge. But since the chase sequences are basically this game's ""boss fights,"" the designers seemed to feel obligated to make them the most challenging segments. And they are, without question, the most difficult parts of the game. This means unless you are a wizard you will be repeating these chase sequences a number of times before you manage to complete them, which kind of ruins the immersion you get from having a chase sequence in the first place.This is only a semi-complaint though, because completing these chase sequences after like 20 tries is definitely exhilarating. If you've played Dark Souls, well, it's a little like that. This is a game that is out to kill you, and it feels rewarding to overcome the adversity after many failures.In my opinion they could have upped the difficulty in other parts of each level, and then made the chase sequences challenging, but still able to be realistically survived on the first go with some skill and improvisation. That would have made these chases much more thrilling and satisfying--like an adrenaline reward at the end of the level, instead of a final obstacle to slam your face against repeatedly."

Others that I have bought have had this price-tag and been a complete waste. I'm happy to say, however, that Ori and the Blind Forest made it onto the very short list of games that I enjoyed enough to actually finish.A lot of the appeal of Ori and the Blind Forest is in its ambiance and the world that is built. If you like titles like Bastion or Transistor from Supergiant Games, this is just as good with regard to ambiance (if a little less involved with storytelling). The music, the art, the way Ori is animated when he/she is jumping around, everything about this game feels polished, which is something that can't be said about a lot of more expensive titles.Furthermore, the way that the game teaches you to utilize the abilities it gives you is amazing. That ability called ""bash"", funnest and most useful thing ever. The second playthrough seems even more streamlined and fun than the first because of this, because you basically rip through levels and bypass enemies like a trapeze artist.

You really get a feeling that you are fragile and weak at the start of the game and by the end Ori has taught you so well that you are zipping around effortlessly using complex platforming abilities to make it through one of several of the games great set pieces. It's a testament to this game that they could have made it look terrible and it would still be a terrific platformer. But instead they also made Ori one of the best looking games I've played on Steam. The only minor draw back is that areas get blocked off if you progress too far without being careful. This can be frustrating to players trying to 100% the game. But I feel that it's a minor grievance that I personally can easily forgive."

Only few other titles bring tragedy, encouragement, intuitive and challenging gameplay and such adorable creatures into one great game. Great storytelling, beautiful handdrawn graphics, intruiging physics and riddles, inviting to explore the world and challenging the player to find all the secrets are only a few points in this game that made me pull all-nighters over and over again.The really cute and well animated protagonist Ori starts its story in a seemingly doomed world with only a spark of hope(literally!). Soon the way becomes more visible and so is the gameplay. Not bombarding the player with crazy combos for their controlling skills, but introducing more and more movement options and features over the whole game make this an excellent title for newcomers.The gameplay is fluent and only a few parts at each end of the story arcs made me swear and curse my controller (I had to buy a new one during the first clearing run... ;) ). The reason for that was at the end of every arc are sections where the player has to move the figure in a race against the clock for approximately 2 minutes in a perfect manner because the slightest mistake causes a tidal wave or lava outburst (or other adversary events) to swallow him up and the segment starts anew. Fortunately these segments are quite rare and with great maneuvering skills, tons of calmative agent or just pure luck the story continues without delay. After clearing the game I had to start a second run on the spot.Another negative point is the lack of replay value as there is nothing more to do if you found all the secrets in your first run other than spending more time with this game's adorable creatures.All in all it is an amazing game.

A controller is necessary in my opinion.Difficulty:The overall difficulty was good, some challenges but after a few tries I usually made it through. The chase scenes are very unforgiving though, pretty much any mistake leads to death, it's not always clear where to go (especially the last one) and the time limit makes it somewhat frustrating.Length:It took me about 7 hours to complete the game (not 100%, missed a few things) and I spent a decent amount of that time backtracking to get some upgrades. Without that it's probably about 4-6 hours of playtime, depending on how often you have to repeat stuff after dying.Story:Original and creative ideas, while the story is good it's not very deep.Puzzles:There are puzzle elements in the game. not the 'pull this lever than that one than put something on the pressure plate' kind, but a lot of rooms have some objective (especially in the last area) which isn't always obvious at first sight. there are no hard puzzles, but you will have to think a bit about how to get through somewhere quite often.Upgrades:Lots of useful little upgrades for your powers. I don't particularly like the upgrade system, as I needed to take traits I had no interest to get to the ones after. I only missed 2 upgrades at the end, so it's not too restrictive.Replayability:For achievement hunters there's tons of stuff to explore.Overall impression:Very enjoyable game, the challenging parts take either some stubborness to try time and time again or great reflexes to get them on the first few tries. if you enjoy or at least don't mind having to try stuff out and retrying the game is definitely worth playing. It is rather fast paced and needs some reflexes, so it's not exactly a relaxing game."

,Recommended,261570,19819764,"Posted: 21 December, 2015",all,glyzer,"Very, very beautiful (both visuals and the soundtrack) and different platformer. Has a profound story and good game mechanics. I opted in for controller. You play Ori, an orphan creature searching for home. He can level up and gains new abilities in the course of the story. His basic resources are energy and life points, which he gathers and upgrades throughout the game. His objectives in the game are to restore different elements (water, wind, fire, ...) and, not suprisingly, has to deal with enemies and puzzles from all those categories. The difficulty level is proper, so that at times I found myself really frustrated by some sections, but the famous ""one more try"" got me finally through them. The game also has a nice save game mechanics, as you need energy to create a save game point, and there is a cooldown effect on this. So, especially in the early game where your energy reserves are low, you need to carefully think when to save your game. At the save game points, you can also check your ability tree for possible level ups.Overall, there's around 8-9 hours of playtime, and it was all worth it :). I recommend this one for everyone who fancy nice story, beautiful graphics, good atmosphere, and tricky platform jumping."
,Recommended,261570,19833755,"Posted: 21 December, 2015",all,Bluestache,"A slightly unusual, but very well-executed, combat-heavy platformer. Anyone who's seen screenshots will know that this game is extremely beautiful; every background is gorgeous, the characters are detailed and the effects are bright and colourful, all of which mixes seamlessly together to make an aesthetic masterpiece. The main focus of gameplay is platforming, accompanied with fast-paced combat and the ocassional puzzle. But while these usually tend to be the cornerstones of children's games all of these are in fact quite difficult, with an surprisingly (and satisfyingly) high learning curve and one of the most difficult final bosses I've ever fought.While you can potentially complete the game in a day, I highly discourage you from doing so; I discovered to my chagrin that upon completing the game the save file then becomes unusable, so exploration after this point is impossible. With this in mind, I recommend as much exploration as possible upon completing each new objective; do not make the same mistake I did. Exploration is rewarding both in terms of finding yet more pretty areas, but also in unlocking powerups for Ori which, while not necessary, can make the game a lot easier if you choose to use them.And now for the plot: while the story is by no means original or unique it is nonetheless heartwarming, considerably more so than I had originally anticipated. Of all the characters in the game only two are able to speak (the two least important to the progression of the story as a whole, at that) and yet the characters all have their own personalities, even hopes and fears, making the whole experience surprisingly charming and emotional. It has to be said that the ending does feel ever so slightly like a cop-out, but if you imagine this game as a children's game for adults it's easily forgiven - praiseworthy, even. Every detail of the game essentially amounts to this: nostalgiac but difficult gameplay with beautiful settings and a done-before-but-still-sweet storyline, it's the best children's game an adult could ever play. Highly recommended."
,Recommended,261570,19834883,"Posted: 21 December, 2015",all,Sken (Glyph),"4/5. Fanstastic, beautiful game, heartwrenching prologue. Astonishingly good puzzle-platforming, great controls, awesome sound.My major complaint, which is significant enough to warrant a 1 star drop, is the lack of difficulty in the combat. There are very few challenging encounters in the game, and no boss fights. Most of the gameplay is more about puzzle-platforming than surviving in combat (even the most game-changing ""combat"" ability is used primarily for movement later in the game, and it's mechanics discourage using it for combat in many areas). There are a few challenging monsters, but they die in 1-2 hits through a pseudo-quicktime ability use or by running them into a wall.Another minor complaint is that some of the areas become locked through the game progression, preventing 100% completion. There's no real reason they *need* to be locked, for instance there's a water area that becomes flooded and locked via the storyline, but the player can get a water-breathing perk through the skill-trees. There's no reason that area couldn't be re-accessed as an underwater level.All in all though, this game was fantastic and I highly recommend it for ANYONE who enjoys Puzzle-Platformer games. If you're expecting a solid Metrovania, don't level up the combat skill-tree unless necessary or the combat will become too easy to be satisfying. If you're a completionist, treat any zone you have to ""enter"" as if it would become locked when you finish it.Edit: (Note: I 99% completed this game in ~12 hours. It's pretty short, but still worth the buy imo.)"

This game is gorgeous on the level of a high quality anime, with just incredible color and detail.  It is an absolute treat to look at.My one negative comment that I have to make is that THE KEYS ARE NOT REBINDABLE.  That is either an oversight or just a bad design decision by the developers.I've been playing this game with my sister and she is having a tough time with the controls.    She's used to moving with the arrow keys, not WASD.  This wouldn't be a problem except that the way the controls are configured, the arrow keys are part of the KEYBOARD ONLY controls.  If you want to use the MOUSE AND KEYBOARD controls, you must use WASD.If we could rebind the keys we could move the ability buttons next to the arrow keys, allowing her to use the buttons she wants while having access to the mouse as well.   This is a really significant inconvenience.With that one gripe in mind, this game is still an amazing 9/10 for me.  An awesome game!  Buy it!"

The first one was the hardest, and if you can make it past that, you can handle everything that follows. You might have to make hundreds of attempts, but you'll make it!

,Recommended,261570,14915458,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,Bürd,"The gameplay is very fun and fast paced, and was slightly challenging. Also, some original ideas were implemented into the game.Graphics are very nice. But you know, most new 2-D games have room for nice graphics.Music was relaxing, but that's the only mood of music you hear. Very few areas (75% being events) didn't have calm music, and that music was generally a remix of the main theme. Personally, for a game labeled ""Great Soundtrack,"" I think there wasn't much variety.The Storyline is very hard to follow. Then once you understand, many actions made by the characters don't make sense. It's best not to question anything and just sit there and nod while saying ""Mh hmmm....""Controls are smooth and have just enough complexity, just sometimes you may anger the Sticky Key god who will crash your game. You might want to disable that feature.To sum it up, I really enjoyed playing the game. The Gameplay was just really fun and the extra positive features just made it even better. I do prefer lengthy games, so that fact that it took me 7 hours (With screwing around) kinda made me disappointed. To add on, there seems to be very little replay value since all you can do after you beat the game is speedrun it. If you really want to play the game now (Since it is quite fun), It is worth the 20$. However, if you don't have the desire to play it now, you may be best waiting for a sale. Do get this game if you like 2-D platformers since it is a very well made game.4/5 -Very Enjoyable & Well-Made"

The gameplay bears some similarities with 'Child of light', and the smoothness reminds me very much of 'Journey' (despite the fact that this is a platformer and Journey is not). The different soundtracks manage to melt into one another as you progress, and it fits perfectly with the visuals, and they are definitely two of the things that stood out to me the most. The music as a whole gives the game a very refreshing kind of feel.The gameplay in itself was great. In a lot of platformers, they're either on one side of the easy - difficult scale, but Ori and the Blind Forest nestles itself nicely in the middle, with some parts being easy and others pretty challenging (at least for me).  I don't think I have ever played a platformer that has stood out to me as much as Ori has, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves visually pleasing, fun and adorable games."

It's so fluid but you never feel out of control and you quickly feel like you're some kind of parkour master. you gain different abilities later on (I haven't got all of them yet) and they allow you to perform even more awesome movements in the game, reaching more areas (like how the 2008 Prince of Persia unlocked new powers for new places).For me everything about this game is amazing. The level design is perfect, it looks natural and yet precisely designed for a player to travel. The gameplay in general is brilliant, nothing I can fault. And finally, the art, music and story of the game are supurb. I think Moon has done an amazing job with this amazing game that everyone should play."

I loved the music and the story is well done and touching at parts. The style of the game is that of metroidvanias (exploration and item/power-up collection).I played the game entirely on a game-pad and it controls mostly okay. The platforming feels completely solid, but multiple special abilities get tied to the RT/R2 button and so circumstances would arise where I would mean to do a certain ability and I would do a different ability instead. This very rarely happened except in areas of the game where there were items that had to be carried. The carry item button is also RT/R2, which could prove frustrating at times. This wasn't a constant occurrence, but it did happen enough times that I felt I should mention it.Here's a few things I ran into while playing the game:In one of the areas I ran into what I would consider a game breaking bug. There is an item in this area that you have to carry in order to jump onto certain platforms without taking damage. There was one of these platforms that I would fall through whenever I jumped on it whether I was holding the item or not. I tried to get by without the platform for about 10 minutes, but there was no other way to progress forward. I exited out of the game and relaunched it and then it worked perfectly. I jumped on the platform and was able to progress forward. This was the only time something like this happened and also the only time I had to relaunch the game.During the final part of the game I had some frame rate issues, but other than that the game ran completely smooth for me.As far as the length of the game it took me 7 and a half hours to beat it with 95% of the collectables found. After beating the game I was unable to load my completed data to go back and collect the rest of the items, so keep that in mind if you want to collect absolutely everything that there is to collect.I absolutely recommend this game. It has a few hiccups here and there, but these are minor in comparison to everything good about it."

,Recommended,261570,20387115,"Posted: 7 January, 2016",all,Tusoles,"*****-- Highly RecommendedOri and the Blind Forest: ProsOri is a superb game, with a very, very emotional story behind it.  Within the first few minutes of playing, you are subjected to some of the most impressive video game I've ever heard.  The game mechanics are reasonably balanced, and the controls are intuitive enough to be enjoyable with just a few minutes of initially starting the game up and learning how to jump.The game is artistically beautiful, and feels like you are regularly walking through massive segments of a fairy tale. The creator's put an impressive amount of time into the foregrounds and backgrounds.End of Game Spoiler-- Seriously, don't open it up unless you don't care about the storyline. (If you don't care about storyline, I do not recommend this game for you. There's really very little else to play it for.)When I found out that Kuro was a girl, and was actively protecting her last surviving egg because the stupid damned Spirit Tree killed her other babies... I wanted to not save the Spirit Tree. I wanted to declare the Spirit Tree was evil and not Kuro. Killing everyone elses babies is NOT OKAY just cause you lost yours. Stupid damn tree... :(The game is exceptionally emotional throughout the story. I played this game after finishingDust: An Elysian Tale. The graphics are significantly better than Dust, but the effects don't compare. I digress.Ori and the Blind Forest: ConsThe game does not have much, if any, replay value to speak of. Once you've finished the story, that's pretty much it. Basically, for $20, its got 20 hours worth of gameplay. $1 an hour to be entertained is worthwhile.  It does not offer multiple levels of difficulty, so you can't make the game more challenging after beating it the first time. Its just the game, play it, love or hate, its exactly as it is.The first challenge dungeon that Sein takes you to in order to restore the Element of Waters, high atop the Ginso Tree, is fun. It is challenging. After that, you gain the ability to double jump and 80% of the additional Health and Power orbs become availability. It rapidly scales Ori's power beyond that of the enemies, thereby making survivability significantly easier.Even with a maxed out Defensive skill tree, you take an exceptionally high amount of damage from ""spikes"" which prove to be more of a threat than the monster. This game should not be considered a Hack and Slash game, or even be taken into consideration for people who prefer the ""battle system"". The enemies provide very little to no challenge whatsoever, while the environment significantly deadlier than any foe.Personally, I powered up the defensive tree before the middle support or far left Attack tree. I wanted Triple Jump and Underwater Breathing more than any of the battle abilities. As soon as you get the ""Bash"" skill, enemies are even more laughable. Their risk factor drops to nothing because you can charge in, grab them, kick them into the floor, and then blast them repeatedly. If they don't die, grab them instantly again -- rinse and repeat!The game has no ""quick travel"" trait. Considering it sends youliterallyback and forth across the map numerous times it starts to get annoying walking through the same areas over and over again. Don't need to teleport, but the only reason the game lasted me 20 hours is because I couldn't just use the ""Spirit Wells"" to teleport around the map to save time. Taking that into account, the game is probably only about 6-8 hours of gameplay and 12 hours of walking.The three most exciting parts of the game are the ""escape scenarios"", which demand you focus intensely upon where to leap, Bash, and double jump to next. It is fun, and exciting, but due to all three of these being filled with nothing but instant-death mechanics it can get redundant going through the same things over and over again.Final ConclusionEven with my complaints, just for the story and the music, I would've paid $25 for this game hands down. Compare this game to a movie ticket to waste 2 hours, to see sub-par acting and listen to an easily anticipated and underwhelming script... or you have this game for $20 that will easily delight your senses and keep you on edge during the intense moments of the story. This game is beautiful, emotional, and very well made. I give it a 10/10, and if they made a sequel, I would gladly buy it and play again."

It's so creative, between the names chosen for the characters, and the whole story of what's happening or has happened in the past. If you didn't want to write stories before, this will definitely give you the inspiration and motivation to do so now. Even if the game design was poor, the story to this game could stand alone in a children's book as a best seller.Of course, you'll have to watch for the incredible feelings this game springs forth from you, as it will make you want to cry at a moment's notice. As wonderful as the story is, it definitely has its sad moments where you will mourn for every creature there. Regardless, its still a captivating story.And second, what an absolutely gorgeous game.

The controls are very simply and easy to get the hang of.  The gameplay itself gets complex though, but in a good way.  As the game progresses, you'll obtain new ablities that will be put to the test by increasinly difficult and complex enemies and level design.  Especially the last world of the game.  I found little time to stop and try to think of my next move in many areas, instead having to just go off pure reflexes.  It was great.  The music really sets the tone for the game and fits perfectly with what's going on on screen.  For me personally, the soundtrack is one of the most important elements of a game to me.  The soundtrack to this game really reached inside and made me feel the joy, wonder, sadness, and dread with what was happening on screen.There are not many games I'd give a perfect 10 to, but this is most deffinitely one of them.

Great gameplay, stunning art, satisfying effects, and plenty of challenge to keep a skilled player occupied but there is a glaring flaw that I have personally experienced:This game is unreasonably punishing and not in the good ""Oh man, its so fun when the stakes are high"" kind of way, but in the ""Jesus Christ, do I really have to replay this same 5 min section for the 50th time in order to get back to where I was?"" kind of way.The way saving works is awful. You, the player, choose where to spend a small number of saves at a time. This is fine in theory, but its quite easy for the player to accidentlally get themself stuck with a really bad save decision where they will have no choice but to replay the same sequence over and over...and over in order to try that one pesky jump again.

Between the breathtaking art style and some of the best music scores I've heard in a game, it felt as if I were in a Miyazaki film.Before I even got to the real meat of the gameplay, the story had already grabbed my attention, and all but had me in tears in the first 5 minutes.  And from that point on, it was just a never ending ride of joy and tension.  I love a story that can be told with few or no words at all, and this game delievered beautifully on that.  (Though I honestly could have done with less exposition from the Tree of Life.   He would seriously explain something that was already revealed perfectly through the visuals immediately after it happened.)I started out using a keyboard, but had to switch to a controller simply because there was no possible way to maneuver without a joystick.  The platform mechanics got rather complicated as I unlocked newer ones.  Sometimes I'd end up dying over and over again simpy because I kept mixing up how to activate certain abilities.  Thankfully, it was never a deal breaker.  Even during the long, no checkpoint escape sequences, I never end up rage quitting.  It was always that good kind of frustration, where if I just tried this one thing different, or jumped a little more to the right, I could make it.  Also, the music never restarted when I died on those levels. So that up tempo, heroic score was always encouraging me to keep at it, and it was SO rewarding when I finally succeeded.  (Though I did nearly snap my controller in half several times.)In short, I loved playing this game, I loved looking at this game, and I loved listening to this game.

This is probably on the long end of what it takes to complete it for reasons I’ll mention in a bit.First, I’ll say that this game is one of the BEST side scrollers I’ve played ever.  It has this beautiful mix of difficulty and reward culminating into a fast past ending that makes you use everything you’ve learned throughout the game.  Props to Moon Studios for the incredible work you’ve done!The abilities are reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda, where you have to get them to get by certain areas, but you can go back to get additional power ups once you have the new abilities.  Just like TLoZ, this was never annoying but instead created a goal for you to achieve.  Which is why my game went on longer than average.  Going back and getting power ups.The game plays very fluid, and Ori’s handling feels very good.  Because of that it is very easy to use the controls but difficult to master many of its abilities later on.  However, the game teaches you how to use all of the abilities really well, without a lot of reading and practice and most of it is taught by progressing through the level you’re currently in.If I had to complain about anything it would be that it is over.  I feel like the game did what it set out to do, so I’ll not complain about the lack multiplayer.  It would be awesome to see some challenge levels though.  Perhaps the community can help there."

Flaws you've sort of come to expect in games (and maybe don't even notice anymore) are non-existent in Ori. Things like awkward animation transitions or hiccups, texture seams, the occasional bad line of writing or voice acting. It's clear that an enormous amount of effort went into making Ori as close to perfect as it could be.Aside from that, the only improvement I can think of would be a new game+ feature. While the save system does a lot to streamline your play experience, you don't realise until some way into the game that you're continuously overwriting the one file. So if you save after... certain events... you lock yourself out of exploring the rest of the game world. You can copy save files, but only in the main menu."

This is essentially the platform mechanics of Megaman and the death from all sides of any 'bullet hell' style game with a dash of metroidvania to some degree.Pros: Fantastic art, one of the best soundtracks around, enjoyable story and one of the cutest protagonist sense ""Lilo & Stitch"" , excellent animations and some minor RPG elemments with a talent tree of sorts.Cons: Abusive number of traps and instant death mechanics make the life bar nearly pointless, alot of nasty situations that you are thrown into with no chance to react resulting in completely unavoidable deaths untill you have seen it a few times (Think ""Impossible Mario"") ultra tight controls combined with paltry physics mechanics lead to excessive amounts of button mashing as you try to possition Ori just right on tiny platforms. Some other mechanics can be erratic resulting in further deaths, especially the wall CLING , but once you get wall climbing thats less a issue.  Chase scenes get over used and worse yet, never let you save so no matter how far you get through one if you die at the last minute your right back to the start. Many effects are very bright combined with Ori's natural BRIGHT WHITE visage its extremely easy to lose track of the little guy and die in many areas.Final Result: After two hours I had slightly over a hundred deaths and im pretty damn good at most games all things considered, so if your outright bad at platformers, sensative to flashing lights or are easily frustraited you may want to wait for this to go on sale.

I'm usually not that emotionally touched by games, I tend to find myself entering so-called ""emotionally engaging"" experiences and coming away feeling somewhat cheated. So you can imagine my scepticism when I was told that the opening to this game would make me cry, and it absolutely did.I've only a few annoyances with the game - Many of the earlier obstacles (The first 5-6 hours or so) only have one way to get past them, and you can die many, many times attempting to do it. It gets quite frustrating, at first I felt sad when I let Ori die, but by the 1,000th death (No joke, I think I ended on 1,200 or something after 12 hours), I was just getting annoyed. This clears up later on, though, when you get more abilities and access more ways to beat obstacles. It becomes less frustrating at that point.There's also the slight irritation of save-game locking upon completion. Save games lock once they're marked as having completed the game, which is annoying for me, as I'm a perfectionist and like to complete everything in a game - Including collectibles. Its a minor annoyance, I'm sure there's some work-around - But if you're a completionist as I am, dear god, complete everything before you go to the final area.But beyond the irritation, the beginning and the ending are absolutely beautiful. The limited voice talent (The main characters lack voice acting, which only adds to the emotional cutscenes) is brilliantly done and fits the theme of the game very well. Its one of the few games where I finish it and I don't want a sequel, I don't want to replay it. Not because it wasn't great, it was magnificent, but because it was a unique and genuinely touching experience, and I don't want to change any of it."

Nevertheless, besides the art and the overall cuteness of the main characters, I'd say everything else from this game is pretty average. There were some sections where the game turned bothersome, having to repeat a long sequence of steps because of the game not allowing me to save, but these were sporadic, and therefore bearable.I recommend using a controller to play, specially because of the high precision you need on certain parts of the game."

From beautiful artworks to music that will give you a massive boner of feels, this game got it all. Look, let me put it into a perspective. I'm a big fan of Half-life (the first one). I've been waiting almost 3 years for the remastered, ""Half Life: Black Mesa"" to come out. I bought Black Mesa (Though it's not finished, it let's me play 90% of the story) and also bought ""Ori and the Blind Forest."" Being an overly excited fan, naturally, I played Black Mesa first. After playing that beautiful game for abour 2 days, I decided to take a break and switch to a different game. I remembered purchasing ""Ori and the Blind Forest,"" so I installed it, ran it, and I did not go back to Black Mesa until I finished this amazing game.Combat system is freaking amazing. ""Boss Battles"" got me screaming and jumping up and down on my chair due to overwhelming amount of adrenaline and excitement. I will even go as far as saying, this is literally the absolute best platformer game I have ever played in my entire freaking life. I did not cry at the end, but I was dying from heartache instead.tl;drDo yourself, your lover, your pet, your friends, anyone else in your freaking life a favor, and play this beautiful game.

The graphics are stunning and all the feels you'll get during the game and the end are well worth the struggles you might have getting there.

76561198024179463,Recommended,261570,15216218,"Posted: 5 April, 2015",all,kokmaister,"TL;DR: This game is a masterpiece, not only gameplaywise, but also emotionally and audiovisually. A strong recommendation to anyone who even remotely likes the exploration platformer genre often referred as ""Metroidvania"". An addictive game, that I personally think is one of the best eploration platformers, maybe ever. And no need to wait for a sale: BUY IT! Totally worth the money.The long version:The first time I read some preview about Ori and the Blind Forest, it sounded too good to be true. A really beautiful exploration platformer, that should have fair challenge and great gameplay from a brand new team, which is scattered all around the world. Yeah, I guess I can't be blamed of being a bit skeptical.But, oh boy, oh boy, was my skepticality proven wrong. This game is exactly what was promised.First the good things: When you see even one screen of this game, it is pretty obvious, that the game is one of the most beautiful and athmospheric platformers ever made. It is just drop dead gorgeous and it is also accompanied with emotional soundtrack, that suits the game very well.Ori also plays great. It even manages to introduce some new elements to the formula via unlockable abilities. The abilities and game mechanics manage to keep the gameplay fresh from start to finish. And I really liked, that the game's duration is somewhere between 8-10h depending of your playstyle and platforming abilities (this one has some really challenging, BUT FAIR, sections), it kept the game ""quality over quantity"". I won't spoil anything about the ""boss battles"", but I really liked what they did here. Also the saving system is something I really liked. It's kind of a compromise from the traditional way and save anywhere.The level design is really good. The art varies just the right amount to keep things fresh, but not confusing, and so does the challenges. There are variety of challenges, some requiring combat, some precision platforming and some require wit. At one point in the game I missed the genre standard teleport rooms, but as I went further, I realized, that he world map was connected and objectives placed so well, that it wasn't a problem anymore. And what about secrets and places you can reach later? Yep, all there.Usually the story is just something you want to skip in platformers, but I have to say, that Ori managed to capture my attention. And the ending... Won't spoil anything. All I'm gonna say: it's beautiful.So, what about the negative things? Like most games, this game isn't pure perfection either:In the beginning of the game the controls feel a bit floaty, or just something little that is off. But it's no problem during the most of the game, especially as you get one ability unlocked in the relatively early part of the game, that gives you a lot more control. Also it felt, that my brains adjusted pretty quick to the floatiness. But there's few precise sections where that mattered a bit.Some of that gorgeous art does not come without caveats. There are few places, where you don't quite realize, that something is harmful and some places where it's a bit hard to notice what is on backgroud and what on foreground. But like I said, there are only few places like this and once you realize what is what, there's no problem anymore.All in all the problems this game have, are so small compared to the good things, that it don't matter a lot and don't hamper the overall enjoyment. It is a true gem of craftmanship and love to the platforming genre. It pushes things forward and don't settle just copying things from old games. A HUGE recommendation! BUY IT! Don't wait sales, just BUY IT! Totally worth the money."

It holds a fine balancebetween art and 3D textures to make the world look believable.The music is some of the best music I've ever heard in video games. While the main theme repeats in most of thesoundtrack, it differs enough to make it enjoyable. Personally I wish I knew where to download the OST.The story is both sad and heartwarming. It really likes to show kindness towards other creatures.You are the reason the forest is decaying but you didn't know it so now you are trying to bring back life to the forest.The game is a 2D platformer where you take role of Ori, a tiny light creature who is essential to the forest, and you jumpand run around trying to fix the forest. You start off limited to only run and jump, but as you go on, you gain abilitiesthat help you traverse the landscape. These abilities come gradually when you just about mastered the previousability. Among them is the unique Bash ability that dominated how you move about. The game has tight controls thatisn't hard to master, and once you goten all the abilities, you almost fly around getting from one place to anotherseamlessly.The game amazed me on all fronts and backs and has rightfully taken place on my top 10 games of all time.

The gameplay itself is a well balanced platformer with light RPG elements, i.e. XP, skills & abilities. However do not be fooled by the lovable characters and colourful scenery, this game is HARD. Some areas require some degree of skill and timing to progress and will require a trial and error approach.

The music and the gorgeously rendered and animated environment combine to transport me into a whole different world like few games have (and this from a platformer). The main character moves so fluidly and is so cute I want to scream. The game is fairly short, and the puzzles are fun but not so challenging that you get bored or have to watch a playthrough just to get through the game. The story is nice, cute, but not amazing, though it has some good, eh, lessons to remember (the power of kindness and all that jazz). It did bring tears to my eyes in the beginning though. The mechanics and movement are super fun and just simply look so good that I could watch Ori jump through the air all day.The bad part is that all these animations and the reactive environment require a fairly powerful computer and mine was lagging at least a little bit for most of the game, and burning hot.

Most games, are covered by a huge amount of media and I am but a humble gamer...one whose opinion usually falls in line with the rest of the crowd. I haven't written a review before, because, most times it didn't feel like the ends would justify the means and...well...This game changes that.Ori and the Blind Forest, developed by Moon Studios, produced by Microsoft Studios take a softer turn in the realm of Metroidvania stylized games by invoking lush, elaborate set pieces and smooth mechanics. The story feels familiar to something of the likes of a Studio Ghibli film and has the gentle, polished look of a lifelike watercolor painting. It has the general scenario you'd expect: An orphaned object falls from the sky only to be retrieved by a mother like figure who then raises the creature. From there, the world becomes a dark place and light has fallen from the world. Your job, pretty simple: Restore the light to the forest.But realistically, part of me doesn't really care about the story. It's all about the mellow nature of the game and the beautiful score that accompanies it. It sucks you in and you don't want to leave because, aside from the astonishing amount of times you'll respawn...it is a very peaceful way to spend your time.Do take the time to remember to save. (Cuz, I didn't....a lot)Now, I can't say you can play the game in a multitude of ways. It's a fairly straight path to leveling up: You explore the map, you find hidden spots, you gain new power-ups and you collect energy, life, or ability orbs to enhance those power-ups. The orbs are vital in order to die less. There's just no getting around that.But to sum it all up: The game offers an amazing, breathtaking wonderland full of waterfalls, lava pits, the greenest of forests and comes with a pleasant story-line. The soundtrack is amazing and I'd highly recommend this to anyone who loves the old school platformer format with a modern, alluring aesthetic."

You'll get stucked in some paths and may only be able to pass through when you memorize the whole thing.But don't let this little thing turn your game experience down! It wasn't thaaaaat hard, I didn't get stucked for like five hours in the same spot... it's not like that, the problem is that the game don't give you too much time to react.That being said, Ori and the Blind Forest is an amazing piece of art. The graphics, soundtrack, level design (and the changes the levels go by when you archieve some objectives) is astonishing; the story, though, is quite simple.The gameplay, in the beginning it may seem boring, but as you learn more skills, the combat mechanics gets more interesting, your creativity makes place. Nevertheless, the game is still a platformer, if you don't like this kind of game, may not be interesting at all in this aspect."

A legacy it seems, that simply refuses to die (thank the gods).  People not playing OTBF would clearly be missing out on a landmark.  The kind of landmark that will be durably etched in gaming's Pantheon for years to come.In closing, a word of caution though : OTBF is not designed to cater to the casuals, as it is a rather difficult game (albeit never frustrating from my point of view) that requires some level of skills.  Other than that, buy and play this game.  It gets my highest praise and recommendation."

I cant tell you how impressed with the simplistic storytelling that is so powerful that it pulls at your heart strings from the very beginning.The controlls are solid. the quality and visual art is nothign short of a masterpiece. Simply stating its a beautiful game that deserves to be purchased and deserves to win several awards.Would i recommend this game? ABSOLUTELYOnly Downsides i can see so far.1. no option to continue once you beat the game. such as collecting missing items or powerups ect. you literally cant play that character again once you beat the game.2. The controlls are legit on an actual controller.. On the keyboard however is kind of hard.. i struggled with all the different combinations once you get into the later game. got a controller and OMG so much better3. the overall game is fairly short. you can beat it earlier than you probably want. i would say probably at about 50% of all your health and energy pickups you can get and if you head down that path there is no going back.4. If your like me and you didnt finish the first playthrough then you have a reason to play it a second time.. or for the wow factor to show someone the game... but other than that i dont see the replay factor that high.Would love to see ome aditional game areas added .. doubt that will happen. but overall.. amazing game.

The theme of story start with blue , Then turn to green and End with red.

Gameplay that design very well. as you don't really know that the control is really easy. That's simple. and the level design is very well.

The artwork is nothing short of beauty, and Ori moves with a grace and precision that I have never felt before in a platformer. I am not familiar with recent incarnations of the genre, but I did play loads of them growing up (e.g Keen..) To me, this game has set a new bar for all future platformers that I will play. The controls are spot on, both ""fighting"" and platforming are fun and challenging. New abilites are learned at a quick pace (about 1 per hour if you take your time like I do) and unlock areas that were unaccessible before. Going back to collect that powerup is no chore, however: I found myself delighted to go back on old paths with the new skills both Ori and I developed. The game features a world map where all the ""levels"" are connected without interruption: the rather hefty load at game stars covers the entire game (so far).I cannot speak for super meatboy pros and the like, but in my book this is the best and most beautiful platformer in years. Don't even get me started on the story and cuteness of the characters. I play everything from RTS to RPG, horror game to shooter and this game has knocked me out of my socks. Amazing. 10/10"

The game has no trouble getting you into it, and the gameplay is also fun AND challenging. I didn't expect such a cute looking, Disney inspired game to challenge me so much (not as hard as Dank Souls tho) and it will challenge you as well, The level designs change throughout the entire game, forcing you to get creative on how you'll pass the level and skills you unlock might feel like things you should have had at the beginning, but that feeling doesn't last and this is really the only con I have for the game, that's how good this is.Now the story, spoiler free - it's good and delivered very well, and the Disney inspiration is shown in it right off the back, with a very rewarding ending that made me love the game even more. It might not feel original since it IS inspired by others, but it doesn't take away from the experience at all. The Soundtrack is a masterpiece itself, helping you feel even more immersed when playing the game.Long story short, this game is an incredible piece of art that I would recommend to anyone, even at its full price.

I dithered over getting it for ages because the screenshots looked a bit meh, and finally caved over the Steam sale after looking at the reviews. And it's one of the few games I'm being slow about finishing purely because I don't want the experience to end. Those screenshots really don't do the the credit it deserves.It's jaw-droppingly beautiful, taking into account both the music and the artwork, particularly the backdrops. After having gone through a fair amount of rubbish artwork over the last couple of decades as developers have tried to catch up with improving graphic capabilities, the kinds of scenery and other artwork going into modern 2D platformers is, frankly, amazing - Giana Sisters, Trine, Ori etc just look so good. The story isn't a Tolstoy epic, of course, but plucks at the heart-strings just enough whilst having a a villain that you both dislike and empathise with.And the gameplay is spot on. Essentially metroidvania but the controls are pretty tight, it's classic and fun platforming, keeping it simple enough that it's accessible but there are some tough spots which actually feel rewarding to get through (rather than rage-inducing to the point of it being a slog). Like every time I tried I'd get a little bit further, make a mistake and work out how to get further still. It could not be better.If you like platformers then this is damned good."

,Recommended,261570,15566992,"Posted: 26 April, 2015",all,EnduringBeta,"Ori and the Blind Forest is visually stunning, fantastically fluid, and painfully brutal. In this sidescrolling Metroidvania, the player controls the tiny, agile Ori through a journey to restore the dying forest. Ori slowly gains powers through the game to aid in combat and traversal while exploring element-inspired areas.The story is seemingly simple at first but adds layers of complexity and thwarts expectation in ways I appreciated. The handful of characters in the game, despite having very few words, were memorable and had emotional moments. Ori's primary enemy is a giant, dark bird that is legitimately terrifying when encountered throughout the game.Like Ori, this game keeps the player on their toes. Ori can't take many hits without dying and must rely on near-constant movement, dodging, or later reflecting to vanquish foes and avoid danger. Many sections will cause deaths before mastered, but the quick and painless respawn system minimizes annoyance. The notable exceptions to this are the ""escape""-type sequences that are long stretches that must be executed flawlessly.The ability point/experience system was paced well and felt good. Each new upgrade, from more powerful attacks to improving the map to breathing underwater, had a noticeable change that helped guide my play. The player-driven save system, while annoying at first to remember, allows the player to set the pace of their adventure.Finally, the game is the perfect length. Its mechanics are always evolving and never get stale. I clocked in at about 10 hours total after backtracking a bit to collect more powerups. I will mention, however, that when the game suggests there will be ""no turning back"" near the end, it means it: your save file will literally be no long accessible once completing the game. That left me, who wanted to find those last remaining secrets, out in the cold.The most difficult part of recommending this game to people is the difficulty. It's hard to fault the developers: so much of the design of this game inherently requires pinpoint accuracy. If you're a seasoned gamer or up for a challenge, this will be a rewarding, fun experience! If not, and the game still seems compelling to you, definitely watch a playthrough."

It's hard not to compare a Metroidvania game to the likes of Super Metroid and Symphony of the NIght but I am here to tell you that Ori and the Blind Forest jumped into my top ten favorite games and I strongly feel it is a game of the year contender.The first thing you will notice about the game is the beautiful, hand drawn visuals. Immediately following that you will hear the INCREDIBLE soundtrack. These two alone drew me into the world that the new comer Moon Studios has brought to the table.The first ten minutes of the game. Many reviews on Steam claim that the first ten minutes of the game is one of the most heartfelt things to watch in gaming. This is not an exaggeration. I was crying by the end of the opening. I played through it again so I could show my wife. My wife was crying at the end of the first ten minutes.The story is told though a disembodied voice that speaks in an unknown language. As you progress to different areas or come up to story points, this voice will narrate what is happening. The story has a very folk tale/fable like quality to it. Is there a lot of complexity? Not really. There are a few MINOR twists and turns but overall you will find the story satisfying if you walk in understanding that there are a lot of heartfelt, tried and true tropes.The gameplay is classic Metroidvania. Open world concept, where you collect power ups for your health and energy, as well as collect various abilities that increase your options in combat and allow you access to newer, previously hard/impossible to reach areas. In addition, there are RPG elements: you collect spirit light, which turn into ability points when you collect enough. At save points (the game calls them soul links, which you can create almost anywhere you want) you can access three trees of abilities that you can level up.The game can be quite challenging but the save system is so fluid that any death immediately respawns you with no load time to give you another shot. I found myself laughing when I died and not discouraged. It was trial and error: that didn't work, I'll get it this time. Or die again. And try again. And nothing feels better than finally clearing those escape scenes, which are absolutely thrilling.The game averages about 8-12 hours, depending on your desire to explore (which should be strong since you never get tired of the beautifully drawn world or the soundtrack). That can be considered pretty short, but the top player on the leaderboards has beaten it in 27 minutes with 0 deaths. I beat it in 9 hours with 450 something deaths. Because spikes hurt (but not as bad as in a Megaman game).I encourage everyone to try this game. It deserves the acclaim it has received and I hope more people get the chance to experience the world of Ori and the Blind Forest. It's $20. Do it."

Its graphical/art style is gorgeous and unique, and the soundtrack is totally emotional and incredible. This game gives me a lot of the same kind of vibes as from watching Studio Ghibli films like Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke. OatBF's aesthetic isn't the only thing that's beautiful; the story working in-tandum with the colourful visuals and haunting music is what makes this game great. There is virtually no dialogue; the story is told through sporadic narration and character's movements and emotions. It really is quite an achievement that this kind of storytelling can invoke such emotional feelings (tears within the first 10 minutes).Gameplay-wise, it's okay. I haven't played platform games since my early days of playing Rayman and Super Mario, but I did enjoy the simple yet progressively complex gameplay in this. As you unlock new abilities you can traverse the Forest of Nibel in increasingly diverse ways, and this game has the usual platform game tropes of hidden areas or areas to return to once you have the appropriate abilities. This game is surprisingly difficult towards after the first half of the story; the trial and error style gameplay did get me frustrated - I died, a lot - and I'll admit that towards the end I just wanted to finish and get to the ending.Gameplay faults, however, are largely irrelevant because it is OatBF's aforementioned story/aesthetic is what makes this game worth playing. I was really impressed and I am now considering buying Moon Studios' other titles, Journey and Flower, as well as buying this game's soundtrack. I'd recommend getting this game even at full price if you're that keen, but if you're apprehensive I'd totally recommend getting it on a sale."

It is a beautiful peace of art BUT it lacks in some departments of gameplay.To make things short, lets talk pros first:+ beautiful art-style+ nice soundtrack+ interesting romantic story and storytelling+ good controls+ stunning level-design that puts new obstacles in your way, every time you beginning getting used to the previous ones+ a lot of different moves (doublejumping, walljumping, climbing etc.)+ challenging without being to cheap (most of the time)But now the downside:- its pretty short. Even if you collect every item and die a lot, it will probably not take you longer than 10 hours and there is no big reason to play it one more time- no Bossbattles. For me personally this kind of games NEED real Bossbattles (take look at Shovelknight). Instead you get this chases, where you run away to get out of a dungeon, before you drown or get crushed. Its okay, but its basically only the normal gameplay with a timetrial.- a bit boring enemy-design. There are only a few enemys to begin with: snails, slimes, slugs, owls, spiders and that's it. Most of them can be dealt with by klicking them dead with your flame-beam-attack-auto-cannon.- the difficulty has some strange spikes. The game is pretty easy in some parts and gets extremly hard other times (end of the wind-temple, urgh!)- backtracking- boring leveling-system. There are just a few abilities, that are more interesting than ""get more resources"" or ""do more damage""I don't really think, that this game is worth the pricetag of 20 bucks, but its worth the experience, if you don't care about the backtracking, gamelength or sometimes repetitive gameplay, just because of the artstyle and level-design.If you are more interested in the challenge, I would recommend Shovelknight or Super Meatboy over this one."

,Recommended,261570,19277525,"Posted: 25 November, 2015",all,Mazza,"Ori and the Blind Forest is an amazing platformer and one of my favourite games despite the few flaws that are present within the game. Overall I would recommend this game if you are a fan of platformers at all as this game displays great strengths in controls, visuals and audio. This all leads into great gameplay for an enjoyable experience.Breaking the game into it's basic elements, Ori and the Blind Forest is a action platformer with metroidvania elements. You progress through a world, navigating past obstacles, fighting monsters, acquiring new powers and exploring the map. As you fight monsters and find experience points, you level up which allows you to become stronger in combat and exploration; increasing your attack damage, seeing secrets on your map or unlocking the ability to triple jump as some examples. This leads itself to several issues such as the combat is not very rewarding. Combat boils down to mashing your attack when something is within range. Sure, you need to avoid attacks and can use abilities to reflect projectiles or do area damage to spice up combat, but in the end it always boils down to mashing an attack. This isn't to say it is easy or boring but it is definitely a shallow area of the game when compared to some of its strengths.The core strength of the game I found was to be the control. Never have I played a game that feels as nice to control. It is one of those things that is hard to convey unless you have first hand experience with the game itself. At every moment of the game the feeling of control is completely within your hands and no situation feels unresponsive, clunky or sluggish. The ease at which one flips through the air, jumping from wall to wall, manoeuvring between obstacles and enemies alike is simply superb. The progression in which one acquires these skills is greatly appreciated. From basic running and jumping, to wall jumping, to double and triple jumping to bashing, launching, smashing and climbing. It builds the kit in which one can move around in the world and is delightful to master.The world itself is also masterfully realised. It is not unfair to say that Ori and the Blind Forest is the most beautiful game I have ever played. Almost every instance of the game is amazingly realised in its art style and aesthetics. There are a few moments where it fell apart, for me, such as some of the cut-scenes. The way some characters moved and animated felt very flat, however they are only apparent because they are held against the rest of the game which is a delight to see. The audio throughout is also pleasantly well done. This includes the range of audio tracks to sound effects to voice acting. When something needs to be dramatic, the music delivers. When sound effects need to deliver a punch or give feedback to the player they provide. All I can really say in regards to the visual and audio is that they are fully realised and utilised within this game.Finally one of the biggest complaints I'd have with Ori and the Blind Forest would be the story. It just didn't have as big of an impact as it could of. At its best it has moments such as the opening sequence which does a fantastic job at character development. Past that though the game and story devolve into a very basic plot. Struggles to be overcome, evils to be defeated, lessons to be learned. It is not outright bad, the story is serviceable and fulfils its need I just have the desire for something deeper.All in all Ori and Blind Forest is a brilliant game in terms of controls, visuals and sound design with only minor set backs in story and gameplay mechanics. However these issues are minor enough to not impact the initial experience of an otherwise superb game."

Because of this, the game was at times VERY DIFFICULT for me, and as worst I had 500 tries to get past one particular episode (Escape from the Ginso tree). I also experienced a problem with the game crashing upon startup after Windows update.I got excellent help from a developer who looked at my logs and provided solution. I got excellent help from the Steam community the one time I couldn't figure out how to reach an Ability cell.It was so satisfactory when I managed, after many hard tries, to execute a strategy to reach my goal. Ori is so cute, the game is so wonderfully coloured and beautiful, the music is SUPER SUPER NICE, and the story had me in tears many times over. After I quit the game I found a youtube video with all the cutscenes and video clips and rewatched it, soo much loooooove!I've seen some complaints from people that the game may be too hard, in the style of ""I've had over 30 tries in this part of the game now and I am stuck!"". If you tend to feel like this, then this game may not be for you, you are better off playing Pokemon. I've also seen skilled gamers who needs 1-10 tries for the game's most difficult parts, and those who, like myself, need a few hundred tries for the most difficult parts. Whichever category you fall into, keep on playing, I'd say it's totally, totally worth it!Also, extra praise to Moon studios for being able to hire Jabba the Hutt to voice the Spirit tree!Grade: 9.5/10"

Nice for a rainy weekend in.Pros:- Gorgeous graphics and 'fitting' music- Tight enough gameplay for what you're asked to do. Feels somewhere between Trine and Guacamelee.- Expansive map that pushes you to use your abilities- Save anywhere.- Simple ability tree.- Couple unique abilities.Cons:- Game is fantastically easy for the entire overworld and most of the three dungeons, and then fantastically hard for the last 3%. Casual players will get frustrated at these portions.- Reverse difficulty curve. By halfway through the game, like other reviewers said, you can tank everything and save scum what you couldn't tank.- Abilities can be a little OP. Unblockable charage that eats all serious bullets and melee damage for no MP? Can I have this in Super Meat Boy?- Ending needs to not be thought about to make sense."

So very rare is a game that can pull at your heartstrings, and this is one of them.As a relatively casual gamer, the escape sequences in the game were particularly frustrating, but not impossible - this is really the only negative thing I have to say, other than I almost wish the game is longer - not to say it was short (about 10 hours for me for 80% completion) - but that it was a beautiful game that I just wanted more of, which is a rare thing.If you haven't played it, I think you should even when it's not on sale."

Overall though it's a really nice game; challenging but beautiful to look at with a really nice sound track. The storyline is also really interesting. Would highly recommend.
,Recommended,261570,18329981,"Posted: 4 October, 2015",all,Stanza,"I have had this game since the day it was released so I don't know why I haven't decided to review it until now.Basically, if I was going to choose a GOTY, this would be in my Top 3. The art style is absolutely gorgeous and the guys at 'Moon Studios' should be highly praised for the visuals this game presents, everything looks perfect such as the bloom on the bright neon plants for example.The soundtrack is amazing and sets the atmosphere of the game really well, I constantly found the music giving me goosebumps throughout the entire story, I hugely recommend listening to the OST even if you do not buy the game.Even within the first 20 minutes, the plot of the game provokes emotion from you without the need of voices or text.The platforming itself is also presented very well, it's solid and doesn't feel floaty at all which is expected within this game since it can get pretty hard in the latter half and will challenge even experienced platforming gamers. The new abilities which Ori gains throughout the game all serve a purpose and the delay between each ones makes it feel like a real reward, even when you only get the double jump ability.It's a shame that indie games with as much care and effort put into them such as Ori and the Blind Forest don't sell well because the majority of gamers are drones who only want to play adrenaline pumped action games which are just a cheap thrill.TL:DRI'd give Ori and the Blind Forest a 10/10 and recommend it to anybody who is just curious about purchasing the game or anyone who wants a game that they will remember for years to come."

Honestly for the price I expected something with less content and mediocre gameplay, but no...it was all very well done.From the second you load this up and the first few minutes of the game it will quickly set the stage for what you should expect. I did some research before buying this game and I was still very much surprised by it all. Art design and sound direction were top notch. Storyline was right up there with it all. Controls are smooth and fluid aside from some gripes I've listed below.The game isn't without its problems though. Most of them for me were in the controls (playing on xbone controller). Sometimes the game simply refused to register my gliding ability while over lava. It also had huge issues registering my Bash ability....over lava. There were also forced progress sequences without checkpoints that left me repeating most of the entire first sections because of the control issues.*Potential spoilers of what to expect, so I'm putting it last*In the first 5-10 minutes of this game your soul will find a new sadness. I can't believe what they drag you through so early on, it's completely out of the blue. There's a reason for it though, it's key to the story, and I feel it helps you better understand how things are going to pan out."

Not to mention it's brilliant soundtrack and fluffy art style, Ori and the Blind Forest feels like a nice getaway to tide you over. I dont mean that as a discredit to it, though, more like it's nice to turn off and just solve some really nice thought out puzzle/platformingThere are a few cons though. Sometimes the game will have chase scenes and these took me right out of the game, leaving these really tedious sections that were meant to inject some tension into the story when it didn't really felt it needed it.

(not just obstacles)-lots of little touches. rather optional from a development point of view, but they did it anyway.--subtly animated backgrounds--cute little ori sounds--small plants move when u run past--beautiful world maptypical gameplay involves figuring out how to get past obstacles, then trying a few times to get the platforming right (with the help of a save). its a nice feeling when you succeed.by about half way, combat takes a backseat.you begin to see enemies as stepping stones on ur journey instead.dont forget to not forget to not forget to save.wonderful little gem. thanks, devs."

Every since i finished ''Dust an Elysian Tale'' i fell in love with 2D Platformers that focus on a beautiful artstyle and understand that the music is just as important as the visuals. While this game may look like it is for children i can ensure you it is not. First of all the story made me actually cry in the first 5 minutes of the game and the constant goosebumps and shivers down my spine just speak for itself. The first dungeon final was as climatic as it can get and it was awesome. This difficulty level is not for everyone tho. I found it perfect for my skill level but other people that just want to enjoy the story and the beautiful designed levels may get turned off by the difficulty of it.The only bad thing is I can't play it a second time without all the shivers and goosebumps i got from the cinematics and final levels!

That should tell you a lot about how much of an impact it has had on me.This game is incredible. I'm going to try to boil it down:-Controls: Not much to say. They're exactly what you'd hope for. Movement is fluid and satisfying. There is no discernable input lag. The platforming is exactly as I would have hoped.-Gameplay: Classically metroidvania. Powers are collected through story progression and allow for the aquisition of health, mana, experience and skill point collectables across the map. The skill trees are simple and effective with no skills that feel wasted or unimpactful.-Aesthetic: The game is beautiful. The scenery looks hand painted and wouldn't look out of place in an art exhibit. The colours are vibrant and intense. The enemies are a little hit and in aesthetic but universally lovely to look at. Think Studio Ghibli meets both/either of the Avatars.-Music: The score is excellent and perfectly selected. The music shifts between calming and nerve wracking depending upon the scenario. It sets the mood perfectly.-Story: I honestly don't even know how to begin. The cutscenes are Disney-esque soul wrenching. There is barely a word spoken and yet I have never understood a cutscene on a more visceral level. Not at all ashamed to say that I had a lump in my throat in the first 10 minutes, had the same experience in every subsequent cutscene and teared up on three different occasions during the final scene.This game is an absolute must buy; a complete masterpiece.

,Recommended,261570,30573504,Posted: 17 March,all,"Fancy, Schmancy!","The visuals are worth the hype. Every frame is a work of art, and the soundtrack charges every scene with emotion. The core gameplay is solid and fun, allowing you to pursue three different skill paths to improve Ori according to your own strengths and weaknesses. My only quibble is that at times the art is so intricate that it interferes with gameplay. Often it's difficult to discern what brilliant object hurtling towards you is friend or foe, or what constitutes a wall or a background element. However, with the ability to create a checkpoint at almost any moment, the gameplay is still very forgiving. The story is a bit flimsy even for a fairy tale, but it doesn't detract from the aesthetic experience of the game. All in all, I think this is a fantastic game for anyone who loves platformers. I imagine I'll get even more enjoyment out of watching people stream it, when I can sit back and enjoy the art for itself.Also [SPOILERS]: Kuro got a raw deal out of this. I mean, a magical tree passes wind and kills your fledglings, and somehow you're the villain? And for whatever reason, you're the one to sacrifice her life to bring the tree back to life? Kuro is the hero of this game. Ori didn't do squat. There, I said it."

Love how the story itself poured virtually limitless emotion into the game with: happiness, loss, desperation, adrenaline, and even gut-wrenching sadness from time to time (for me anyway)! Finally, the music. I've got to say: Gareth Coker and the orchestra really outdid themselves with this musical demonstration! I won't deny that there were a few frustrating parts, but they were few and offset easily by this game's incredible playability and control! The only disheartening part to me was: that it had to end. I know it had to end eventually, I just didn't want it to. I'm going to hope and pray for a sequal; because this game was amazing and should very much go on! Who's with me?! :)"

I came across it accidentally sometime in 2015 when it was on sale, and decided to purchase it just from looking at the trailer. It looked amazing, and it definitely didn't disappoint. It wasn't until I had beaten the game that I found out it was quite popular, so I'm glad that I could form my own opinions on the game before reading anyone else's.The graphics and artstyle are amazing. The story is so moving for something so simple. Many hidden places and easter eggs. Out of 10, I'd give it a 9. The only downside I can think of for this gem of a game would be that you cannot return to some places after the story has continued, meaning that there may be a few things you have missed and can't return to (a little annoying when it comes to achievements). Overall, definitely a worthy purchase (I haven't bought the definitive edition yet, update to come once I try it)."

Ori and the Blind Forest has utterly gorgeous hand-painted graphics and a beautiful soundtrack to go with it, throughout the game I was blown away with how damn pretty it was.My only gripe? When the difficulty curve hits you it hits HARD, this game has a tendancy to go from moderately easy to ridiculously hard at a moments notice with some sections requiring multiple runs and countless deaths before you finally get the hang of it, the upside to this however is that it's immensely satisfying when you finally beat a segment that you've been stuck on for an hour or so.In conclusion: Buy this game. It's well worth the price and is in my eyes one of the best games to have come out of 2015."

Let me start off with a pros and cons list.Pros:-great soundtrack-good story-fun gameplay-beautiful art-not too shortcons:-framerate issues-cutscene crashes-sometimes excessively hard-a few minor glitchesPositives rant:Let me start off with the difficulty of this game. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a big platformer guy. But man, I've seen a lot of people rage who are, and I'd have to agree with them. I've spent two hours on one puzzle. But really, I disregard the difficutly. in the end, once you've beaten the game, it is very satisfying. I've beaten the game in around seven hours, and I mostly enjoyed it. moving on, the gameplay of Ori and the Blind Forest is very fun, and quite addicting. There are a wide variety of ways to do things in Ori and the Blind Forest. You can also retrace your steps to previous locations and use your new abilities to reach new areas. This is actually essential to the completing the game, and being a huge Metroid Prime fan, found this feature very enjoyable. the game's graphics are absolutely stunning, but be warned, I never got above twenty frames per second with it. Another thing I enjoy about this game is Ori himself. I've never really wanted a plussie in my life, but I think Ori is an exception.Negatives rant:Never in my life, excluding minecraft, have I ever felt the despair of the difficulty of this game. If you like a good game, get this game. But only if you are a Tryhard or have experience with platformers. Because man this game is hard. I busted my butt for two hours on one room, and I had to look up a walkthrough about three times for three different areas. Also, one word. Framerate. This game is incredibley hard on a regular computer. I've had my computer crash on this game twice. The cutscenes are the main offender here. If your game randomly pauses while a cutscene is playing, know you are not alone, and don't spam resume either. I'm pretty sure this game uses the pause screen as a buffering screen. So if you unpause it too early, prepare to restart your PC, because your PC will crash.final verdict:9/10If you're willing to contend with framerate issues and some difficult areas, then buy this game. This game is incredibly well done visually, has a great story, and has an amazing soundtrack. I'm not the one to play a platformer, but this game is my exception. It's hard, yes, but it's a great game. Just remember to think ahead with that drop. You never know what kind of horrible death awaits you down that chasm."

Ori and the Blind Forest is an incredible platformer with a very touching story.

This game took me seven hours and twenty-nine minutes to finish, I ended up with 99% complete and somewhere between 150-200 deaths. The controls in the game are very comfortable and I highly recommend playing it with a controller.Starting off you will be thrown into an amazing introduction which is very heart-touching. As you progress through the game you will find locations that you can't seem to reach. These locations you will be able to reach when you learn new abilities. You can also level up with skill points to make some of your abilities stronger. Throughout the game you will meet some very interesting characters, and develop friendship. Though I do warn you, don't be fooled by the cheerful cover art and menu screen, this game will get difficult as you progress.Ori and the Blind Forest is an emotional ride with beautiful art and music, very well worth the money it costs.

A must-have for every gaming enthusiast out there!Pretty much everything in this game is spot-on.Let's take about the visuals first.The overall Artwork is just lovely. Several layers add a lot of additional depth to the game although it is ""just"" 2D. The world you are about to enter aims right at your heart and it sure won't miss.All the different parts of the environment vary enough to make it intresting and yet not feel completly out of place.The soundtrack, as the rest of the game, is pure gold. Since there is very little dialogue the music gets even more important but Gareth Coker did a fantastic job at capturing the beauty of the world and characters within his music.Characters and story are also top-notch. Although your main character does not speak at all and your little companion only says a few sentences throughout the game they still have lots of character and charme. I'm not even mad about them not speaking. The story is mostly told through visuals and music which is more than enough to make this game a wonderful journey.The short introduction into the world and its inhabitants is enough to make you feel connected to them. Personally I really cared about the world, the characters and their destiny.Controls are on point. Nothing more to say about that. Whether you play with keyboard or controller. Everything works just fine and you always have 100% control of what's happening.The difficulty and pacing of the game are perfect. As usual it gets more difficult the further you progress. The game slowly but surely adds additional challenges by giving you access to new abilities. Areas you couldn't reach before are now open for you to explore. The player is forced to make use of his newly learnt skills and has to combine them all to reach the goal. Once you learn something new the game will make sure to slowly get you used to it and then speeds things up as it gets more challenging. Don't get fooled by the lovely arts tho. Some areas of the game can be quite tricky to beat. It's challenging, yet never gets frustrating.For the price of 20€ you will get about 10+ hours of gameplay. An overall incredible value."

It's not without issue, some sections will be frustratingly hard, and you might survive based on absolutely no skill and pure luck; but aside from the limited segments in game of this, it is a very fair, if a bit difficult game.Story is a bit on the vague side, some stuff not even being explained, which is fine, because who really remembers the plot of any Metroidvania game outside of the fact it controls great and is pretty fun.Gameplay is real smooth when you're in control, hectic when you're not trying to die. Endgame you may feel a bit OP, but by then you've basically earned that right, as you will constantly be hanging by a thread and carefully choosing when to save, as this game has one of the most frustrating, but understandable save systems I've seen in a while.Technical performance is really not my lane, but the game appeared to run at 60fps at 2560x1440p nonstop, no screen tearing(v-sync enabled), and very limited in the settings menu, but the game seems to run fine in my case (i7 4790K,32GB DDR3,GTX980). So YMMV, but it seems to run okay.Overall, 8/10; well worth your time with some weird design decisions, and some run from death twitch puzzles with cheap deaths galore, but definitely worth your time otherwise."

But once you get used to how they flow, you'll be set.Combat system is harsh because everything does immensly more damage than you do. It is also pretty boring, but the game isnt built around fighting, its the puzzles. There are certainly some things you have to fight, but it gives it a bit more of a challenge.Saving is the worst part of the game for me, you have to spend a rescource similar to mana to save the game, a rescource that is hard to come by. And for me personally, it was hard to remeber to save because I would get to wrapped up in what was currently happening.I think this is a game everyone has to try, the only people I wouldnt reccomend this to are the people that can't handle failiure. I see a ton of negative reviews sighting one particular event, the Ginzo tree. The damn tree had my heart pounding out of my chest every time I attempted it. I had to get up and take some deep breaths, or play some other mindless game for a bit, but every attempt I would be happy to get just a few feet furhter than my last attempt. When I beat it I wanted to cry from joy. This games challenges will pummel you into the ground if you arent willing to try more than a few times. Nothing in it is impossible though, and you feel rewarded with every challenge you beat.This game is amazing, don't let the people who couldnt tough out some of the harder parts tell you differently."

You don't really want to be finish with any part.It is by far the only platformer that I have stand diing so far, and still be smiling like a kid.I also like the fact that every section are link by a big map and there is no teleport and no short cut.

But in all honesty, it does everything what a storybased game should do right.I'm someone who loves a challenge and this game gave it in such a perfect manner. Difficulty curve is a bit steep, but I can garantue you that if you're familiar with these kinds of platformers, it won't be that big of a problem. This is really a very good game if you want to play a story without easy mode. The game gives you even the oppertunity to choose you're difficulty at any given time. The game consists out of an upgrade path which is entirely optional, so if you want a challenge, you can try without upgrades. It even rewards you with an achievement, although I know it's not that great of a reward.It's perfectly paced too story and gameplay wise, no need to think ""What just happened?"" or ""Ugh, are we still dealing with this?"". Everything is what it needs to be, slow when it's sad and somewhat depressing, fast when things need to be more dynamic and they need to pump you up to feel more ""connected"" to the game. Hope you understand what I mean.As far as the graphics and visuals go, it's utterly beautiful. The emerging of background and foreground is what makes this game special for me. The environment also displays what kind of emotions are going on at that moment. Although not in every situation, but it still does its job pretty good.Last part I want to talk about is the part that made me buy this game and that is the music. (Although it was gifted to me, but I was planning on buying it anyway, thanks again Activist.)Oh God, how I love this masterpiece. If they would make a movie based on the soundtrack of this game, I would watch it a hundred times, it's that good. The harmonic tune that keeps on reappearing in almost every song is just so astonishing to listen to. It's what keeps me motivated the entire game. I love the escape segments solely because of the music, in all honesty, I'd let myself die multiple times in order to hear it over and over again. It's stupid I know, but it's the music what makes certain games stand out for me. If you're not interested in buying the game, atleast give the music a go, it's totally worth it.Anyways, this was my review and have a good day."

My only complant is that some stages seem a little unpolished with little areas that aren't hard but are somewhat irritating to go through.Usually I'd complain about no bosses in a platformer but the escape sequences are very awesome in themselves.One thing to note is that one ability tree gives you very important platforming options and is almost mandatory for late game. If you somehow find the game difficult definitely try to unlock triple jump. It makes so many situations trivial.

The game starts taking shape after you get a few abilities and have to use them to get through certain areas.The Positive:+ Nice graphics+ Good controls+ Fun platformingThe Negative:- Not fully optimized for pc (if you tab when fullscreen it goes window mode, doesnt find my native res and I have to select it). Streams on the other screen and background can cause lag spikes.- Slow starting area- Enemy variations hasn't been that great so far (not finished it). Also easy to read enemies."

,Recommended,261570,14994343,"Posted: 21 March, 2015",all,hondsgemein,"This game is fantastic.It took me about 17h to beat it. I'm one of these persons who always try to find every secret, so I take my time and revisit older maps when I get new abilities. I nearly managed to get them all, but I only got 99% of the map, the 1% that I missed was at a part that I couldn't revisit. I also missed one cardstone.I also always try to get as many secrets as possible on the first time in an area, because I always fear that I can't revisit it (ironically, that's what broke my neck on getting 100% of the map, because a few areas aren't revisitable, and I missed 1% of an area that isn't revisitable). This made reaching some secret parts extremely difficult. I had to use each and everything available and get the timing exactly right. This costed me a lot of deaths and a lot of time, when I just could have come back later with new abilities. And I died a lot. About 700 times in the whole playthrough (about 50 of them only for the endboss.)I just have to say again how fantastic and rewarding this game is. The difficulty certainly is steep. Not only do you have to think about how do you get from point a to point b, but then you also have to master the timing to achieve getting from point a to point b. And, man, once you reached point b it feels so rewarding. Not because XPs go up or because you found a treasure, no because you found out a way of which you had no clue when you entered the room and then you mastered the techniques for this way, you really feel like you've accomplished something, and that's something only very few games nowadays achieve. I didn't have that feeling in a long, long time.The game also introduces new mechanics in each stage and then new ways to use these mechanics in each part of these stages. And there is never the slightest hint on how you do it, you have to figure it all out by yourself.I played Dust: An Elysian Tail and loved it, but always thought it was a bit on the easy side. Dust had this one mechanic, were you could keep on getting higher into the air by doing combos, so you combo'd from one enemy to another to reach a secret place really high up in the air. Ori has a similiar mechanic, but it's soooooo much harder to master and the enemies are always placed just close enough that you can only reach them with the perfect timing.Also the story is really good. I'm a middle-aged man and I nearly shed a tear at the beginning and at the end. The game isn't cheesy at trying to evoke emotions, the emotions feel real.Replayability is not much there, at least for me. I could replay the game to get 100% of the map. There are also achievements for finishing the game in 3h and finishing it without dying, but I think, I can't be bothered with them.I really rarely buy a game at release and at full price, but I think I got every cent of the 18bucks for it out. Can't recommend this enough. Two thumbs up from me!"

There is also no way to fast travel through the world, so sometimes you'll just have to go through everything else."

The visuals are beautiful without being too rough on the hardware, the music is incredible, the story is gut-wrenching and touching, and it deserves every penny it makes. It did feel a bit short (I finished it 100% in about eight hours; my play time is a bit off because of idling), but for twenty bucks it's worth the cost.I do have a few gripes. This is a difficult game. I like it that way, but some may not. It's fair, but it can get a bit frustrating. Sometimes the foreground gets in the way of the action and enemies and projectiles can be obstructed by the scenery. The world is fairly large, so some kind of fast-travel system would be nice. Am I nitpicking? I'm nitpicking.All in all a wonderful little project. If this game were full-price, I would tell you to wait for a sale, but for $20, it's a steal.

Its art interest me and after I watched the trailer with beautiful soundtrack, I immediatly decided to buy the game (although I have to wait for my payday.)Note: I'm not a fan of platformer and I didn't play this genre much other than Rockman/Megama Series so some platformer veteran might disagree with my review.Art/Graphic is the strong point of OBF. Beautiful and well done. I hardly remember any game with graphic that make me indulged so much like this.Soundtracks and SFXs fit perfectly. I realy like the soundtracks of the escape sequence. It somehow kept me from frustration even after I died 10-15 times. That are how amazing the soundtracks.I play with Keyboard so I don't know how good is the control if I were to play with gampad. However, I have to point out that the game should allow us to remap the button.Story is great although easily predictable. You will find yourself immersed even though you know (or might not) what will happen next. Another great thing is how they told and presented the story. Simple but enjoyable.Another point I want to mention is there is no continue after you complete the game. After you finish everything, you have to start all over again.

It is described by others a a ""metroidvania platformer"" game and I agree with that assessment.Pros:Beautiful Scenery/Imagery the ENTIRE gameGreat SoundtrackFluid ControlsChallenging but not too hardExtremely fun abilities are learned - none of them are lameLots of secrets, hidden itemsGood and very simple talent systemCons:No one told me this and I wish they had...there are three dungeons throughout the game (you'll know when you enter one) and once complete YOU CANNOT GO BACK INSIDE. I was going for 100% achievement and missed it by just 3 items because I thought it was an ""open world game"" and you could retrace your steps and get the things you missed. It is true for the entire game, but not the dungeons.Once you beat the game, you can't play anymore (explore or find missing items/achievements). You have to start a new game or go to a previous save point.Save points are wonky. There are a few in the game, but you have to make a habit of saving it yourself (at the cost of energy) frequently because most areas are hazardous. There are quite a few times that the game auto-saves buf you are just traversing the map and die without saving, you'll find yourself 20 minutes or more behind.Overall:9.9/10 (one tenth of a point taken off for being locked out of completed dungeons) and I will surely replay this game to try for a speed run or maybe even the ""elite"" acheivement. FYI my first playthrough was 9 hours with a lot of exploring and about 300 deaths.Updated 11/25/16. Game is still fun."

,Recommended,261570,16750583,"Posted: 27 June, 2015",all,Premium Bait,"TL;DR, this is a very wonderful game. It might have a short playtime, but it's a very good time. I enjoyed every moments of the story and the epicness of it. The clearing of the Ginso Tree was my favorite moment. It just feel so epic and despite of the fails I had, I still kinda wished I can enjoy it a little longer. Definitely worth your money.I'm a picky person when it's about games, just like many people do. There's no such thing like ""don't judge a book by its cover"" for me, I always judge the cover first so I can tell how good it is inside. I got smitten by this game the very first time I saw the trailer here, and to be honest, I was expecting some disappointment when I play the game, but the only disappointment I get is from my own PC. I'm not actually using a low-spec PC. In fact, it's right in between minimum and recommended requirement. But most of the time I got it all just fine, so it's still fine.It's not that easy to point out what's so bad in this game. Maybe the fact that you can't teleport to some areas is bad, but I think it's a chance for the players to explore more of the game, since the whole game don't have that big of a 'world'. Since CTDs might be caused by my PC's spec, I'll put that aside and not adding it as a con. Regarding to that, though, the game have no options to reduce graphics quality. I know for something that have such beautiful visuals like that, who would want to reduce the quality? Well, I finished the game, but I didn't get the game complete achievement because it crashed somewhere before the credits. I nearly cried twice in this game, one on the prologue, and the (almost)second is on the epilogue. I keep trying to go and see it all myself on my own copy of the game, but in the end I had to look it up on youtube just to see how it ends.Key mapping is also an issue. Whether you use keyboard and mouse, or just keyboard, all buttons are available. The ""controls"" option on the menu is just some kind of manual of what button do what, but there's no key mapping. The only thing that will change your buttons is the QWERTY and AZERTY settings. I mean, sure, all the things you need is right there around your move buttons, but it's so cramped that I ended up holding down a button that's not supposed to be hold at a time, like how I keep pressing shift to climb up but I'm actually tapping space at the same time as well. It's a little bit confusing for me sometimes. I kinda forgot to try to use the arrow buttons to move the direction for your bash, and I've been using keyboard+mouse all the time nearly halfway of the game while I was on full keyboard at the beginning. There's no ""new game+"" here, so I'll just try it again later.I don't have anything else to say for the pros, since the huge number of people that really love this game have pointed out most of it. I really don't mind replaying this game over and over again, since it's just THAT beautiful to see and the storytelling is very interesting. You walk right alongside the story as you play through, as if you're experiencing it as well. The replay value of the game might be pretty high in my opinion, but it's diminishing when you keep on playing it because of the small world. I'd still play it for a lot more times to get bored of it. Another best feature of this game is its soundtrack. That ""Great Soundtrack"" tag is not just for show; it really is great. I've never expected that one theme played in at least three different versions would feel so much different as if that they're completely different theme. A discount is good, but I'm more than willing to pay it full for the OST DLC."

Even if you venture in areas you weren't supposed to go yet and made a safepoint, you won't find yourself between a rock and a hard place; the level design will allow you to go back to the previous area if you haven't accuired the appropriate skill yet.The story is intriguing with a strong and emotional start and a satisfying ending. There's a nice balance between collecting, backtracking for upgrades and following the story. There are quite a lot of hours that can be spent in game, even more so if you're a bit of a completionist and I have found no bugs, glitches or errors.The game allows you to save whenever you want (unless you're on unstable ground or in the ending of an area) but doesn't give you enough slots to misuse them, so spend them wisely!The visuals are phenomenal, very charming although sometimes I got a little confused as to what was in the background, in the playing field or in front of it, but this happened just two or three times.All in all, a very beautiful game, very challenging but in the best way. 10/10, will absolutely play again!"

From some point of view this game is similar to Rayman Origins/Legend with the differences that this game is not so fast to play but needs more logic to complete the journay.This game is not so easy, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is new to platformers but if you want to learn to play a platformer that needs higher skills then just walk and jump, feel free to play it.I could say two things that cought me in this game:First of all, the atmosphere. At the beginning I thought it will be a simple platformer game with very beautiful environment and music with a nice story and loveable characters. But very soon I realized that this game is far more then just a nice weekend platformer. As you earn experience and gain new abilities you must choose which skills to empower with the talents. You can adapt them to your playstyle.I have played it with an Xbox 360 controller. The handling was pretty smooth, I didn't have problem to switch between the skills, chain them to reach the other platforms and hidden chambers.I couldn't really tell any negative side about this game at the moment.In long ago this is the first game I'd like to complete to 100% percent.

,Recommended,261570,14915940,"Posted: 16 March, 2015",all,heartattack170,"I've been following the development of this game since it was first revealed and -needless to say- I bought it the very second it was released on Steam. I'll say right off the bat that more games need the type of beauty found in Ori and the Blind Forest - visual and otherwise. The graphics have a colorful, detailed depth to them, despite the fact that the game is a 2D sidescroller. Everything feels ""alive"" in the game world; layers and layers of the environment are detailed and animated in a brilliant mixture of hand-drawn 2D and 3D style art. Things sway and move in the wind - creatures and trees move around in the background and foreground. It's incredible! The only critique I have with regards to the look (and by extension, the feel) is the fact that the camera often feels a bit too far from your character. So, basically, on occasion you will find yourself losing track of your character in the middle of a fight and you'll die because of that. Luckily, however, the game's modern save system helps alleviate some of the difficulty by allowing you spend a point and create a ""soul link"", which lets you save your game anywhere you want as long as you have a point to spend and aren't near enemies. The audio in the game is beautiful as well. The music is simple-yet-evocative-yet-soothing-and-calming. The sound effects are crisp, detailed and high quality...and overall the game's sound is very well done.The difficulty in Ori seems to be very well balanced. Nothing too crazy, but you DO need a certain amount of skill to play many portions. Some areas are actually one-chance ""chase"" scenes where you need to have fast reflexes or keep dying in order to learn and memorize the next area and beat it. There's a nice character ability customization feature where you spend ability points to learn new moves and/or build Ori's other abilities to access previously inaccessible areas. I'm not TOO far into the game - I've spent about 6 or so hours playing - but overall I am absolutely loving Ori and the Blind Forest. It's challenging yet balanced, it looks beautiful, it plays beautiful and doesn't have a tough learning curve - which is important for someone like me who doesn't have too much time on their hands to spend learning a complicated system."

Most importantly; the gameplay is superb. The movement is fluid, controls are well thought out, and the user interface is easy to understand.

It's an emotional story about hope, light, fear and darkness and if you are not emotionally touched by this game you are probably made of stone.""You play as Ori, a forest spirit who is cast away from the powerful tree you protect. You are then found by a mysterious creature that takes you in as her child. Time pass and the forest withers in your absense from the great tree. Eventually your caretaker dies and you set out in the world once again. When you are on your last breath the great tree gives you a last chance, sacrificing himself for you to gain a small energy companion. You later find out that in order to revie the forest, you must free the different powers that once controlled it.The game is a typical platformer where you solve different puzzles and get upgrades as you progress. Ori also have a talent system with 3 different trees to specialize in. The trees can be leveled simultaniously or one at a time. The only requirement is that you have the previous talent and enough ability points in order to unlock the next. The small companion orb works as your weapon, shooting flare bolts at nearby enemies. The game flows well and is probably better on PC than consoles, since you can play it in 60 FPS which will definately give you a better experience. The difficulty is quite high for the average gamer and you will die a lot. Finally completing an area though, is very rewarding.The graphics are utterly gorgeous and make the game even better at telling the story. The true masterpiece of this game though, is the soundtrack. I sat completely speechless the first hour. The music is jawdroppingly good, I cannot praise it enough. The story is easy to follow and very sensitive and gripping. You really want to continue so that you can hear it all.This was one of my most anticipated games of the year and it did not fail to deliver one bit. In fact it is so hard to beat it has a good chance of staying my favorite game of the year. All I can say is buy it, and experience the best gaming have to offer."

The narator comes in only to give a few words, while your companian (not Navi *cough* *cough*), is perfect for discribing it.I'll say this right now, my laptop can't run it at best, but it does a fairly good job overal.  Even with a weaker graphics card, it still can do a fairly good job, only one major tank and that's after a fair amount of gameplay.  For some weird reason, it curropted my save and forced me to restart it all, but still is a great story.You can really feel just how much effert is put into the both the world and creatures.  Yes, they are simple spiders, frogs, bugs, and something along the lines of slime, it does a fair job at introducting them all and doesn't over use them.  The bosses on the other hand could be a bit more interesting, but make a perfect ground for understanding how to use your ablities without a turtorial breaking up game play.The combat is simple, but flows so easily that half the time I'm just messing around bouncing like a rubber ball around the area.  You have your basic attack and charge, both fairly simple.  Then it introduce bash, which brings a entirely new way to fight and platform, I haven't beaten the game yet (thank you curroption), but I have seen most of the abilities.  I know my platformers fairly well now, if they reuse each ablity you gain over the playthrough and try to make you use them in a new and unique ways to get around is a perfect choice in my eyes.And before I walk away, the graphics are amazing.  Between just seeing the world alone...breath taking.  Of course that is part of the higher graphics requirement, which I can deal with.  (Skyrim did the same to me, don't point...) Honestly, I would like to see some way to lower the graphics a little just enough for some of the less new comeputors to be able to run it.  I'm not going go into the configs or anything outside of a menu to try and change things...I'm not that kind of guy.Finaly decision,The game shows some really good macanics and story.  The world building and setting feel perfectly stuck together and seems to work perfectly.  For anyone who isn't sure what this game can do, I suggest you head for the first element, finish that part of the game and I'm sure you know if this is your kind of game.  (Even with the tanking, its for me!)  Over all, if you enjoy platformers and or have a computor that can run this then by all means grab it."

Games like this are few and far between and if you are a fan of platformers then this is a must for your collection.From the moment the games starts you are drawn in by the amazing visual effects and the soothing musical score that keeps up with the pace of the game through out. Not to mention the story line that goes with it if you havn't watched the play through then until you get to the end you may wonder why bother but it just adds to the feeling of the game.The game has a nice learning curve so you don't have to be a hardened gamer to complete the game just stick at it and you will get there I promise.So thanks to the guys at Moon Studios and also Microsoft for not keeping this as an Xbox One only game.Go buy it now

I liked Super Meat Boy, Shadow Complex, Limbo and Fez but this beats them all IMHO.  The game is gorgeous, it runs amazingly well even on older hardware, and the mechanics are extremely tight and satisfying.  Navigating through previous areas after you've obtained more abilities feels great and makes you realize just how well Ori moves.  It can be frustrating at times, but then you get better at figuring out what you need to do and you get past it, which is also a very satisfying feeling.  The music is great and fits the scenes perfectly, and the story is surprisingly dark and sad.  It's just an outstanding presentation all around.A couple of tips to help prevent some frustration: Energy is plentiful in the game so don't be afraid to drop a save point before a tricky area, and when you get the ability to fling yourself off of projectiles and enemies don't forget you can hold the button to slow everything down and give yourself a couple of seconds to aim.Highly recommended.  Watch for this on many game of the year lists for 2015."

The visuals, the music, the simple controls... I have spent so many years of late playing MMO's and FPS style games that I had forgotten just how much I LOVE platform games. I grew up on Nintendo, starting with the NES, so the 2-D sidescrolling platform games always call out to the 80's kid in me.Artistically, I am just blown away. I remember an article that was in Game Informer magazine, issue 207 (back in 2010), that poised the question:  ""Are games art?"" In response to Roger Ebert's proclamation that ""video games can never be art"", the staff writers at Game Informer made reference to the following games:IcoShadow of the ColossusMass Effect 2Heavy RainLittle Big PlanetBioshockIf that same question were asked in this day and age, ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" would be listed as the #1 representation of video games being a form of art (followed by the Borderlands series, the more recent Tomb Raider games, Alan Wake, Enslaved: Odyssey To the West, the Bioshock series, The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, and so many more).An amazing blend of graphics, music, gameplay, and story, I highly recommend this game--even at the full price point of $20. I hope to be seeing more games like this in the near future!"

You have been warned.With that out of the way, let's start talking about my experience so far.Pros:-Amazing art. If you love masterful hand drawn animations and visuals, your in for a treat-Difficulty. Tgis will always vary person to person, but for me this game is challenging but not too hard. It keeps me wanting to play more and more-All around sound is fantastic from attacking sound cues to the soundtrack.-Controls well with a keyboard, not sure about a controller though (but its probably fine considering its out for the Xbone One.)Cons:-Cutscenes are not skipable (I don't mind, the cutscenes are short and there are few of them, but some will not like this)-Good reaction time needed. This is game is very reminiscent of metroidvania games where time and reaction are important (this isn't really a con, more of a notice for all you turtle :D).-Cost. Some poeple will have a hard time justifying the price of this game. I can honestly say that this was worth every penny of the $20 I paid for it though.Conclusion:Ori and the Blind Forest is probably one of my favorite games of this year. It reminds me a lot of Dust: An Elysium Tale and Mark of the Ninja, both hand drawn games with a heavy story focus and good mechanics to back them up. If you didn't like games like that, you probably won't like this. But who knows, this might be the game you were looking for.Other notes:I did not keep up with the release of this game following its announcement last year. I thought it was an Xbox exclusive and mentally blocked the game entirely. I'm really glad that this game was released for PC and hope to see more from the same developers."

,Recommended,261570,14929409,"Posted: 16 March, 2015",all,Rhumald,"I absolutely loved this game. It is a Metroid-Vania with a high focus on storytelling which, in my opinion, is more captivating than most of the earlier Metroid games, and it's backed by absolutely beautiful scenes, intuitive progression, and solid mechanics; something the classics and many more recent titles lack.Ori and the Blind Forest is a 2D platformer offering roughly 7 hours of unninterrupted gameplay, which takes place in the forest of Nibel at a moment in time when it is considered ""blind"", exactly why would spoil a repeating plot point, so I will leave it at that. You play the role of, as the title suggests, Ori, a small and fragile creature born from and composed almost entirely of ancient forest magics. Ori is tumultuously assigned task of saving the forest, and all life as we know it, from the brink of catastrophe. Unlike the Final Fantasy series, which creates heros and heroines with the explicit purpose of saving their worlds from catastrophe, OatBF goes out of it's way to explain our heroine's background, without detracting from the main story,and involves the player in the story almost literally every step of the way.After purchasing this game in the late afternoon I found myself completly drawn into the story, it takes a page from Bastion by dynamically narrating parts of the story, but, similar to Beatbuddy, crates it's own 'ancient tongue' for the purpose of immersion, and displays the translation on screen. Which this does wonders for immersion, there are times when you're bouncing around an area and blow past minor plot points, and with no way to replay them, and may find yourself commiting suicide just the catch what you'd missed.OatBF lets the player save at any time, so long as they have at least 1, and later half, a mana point left in their mana bar, and there, you are on the ground, and there's no 'danger' nearby. Doing so may recover a minor amount of HP if you've invested the skill points into it, and it's one of the only things your magical little creature of light really needs to use it's mana pool for, which is all the better, as you'd find yourself quickly running out if any of your mobility related skills required it.Gameplay itself focuses heavily on challenging navigational puzzles, and introduces new navigation related abilities at key points during the story, which open up a new avenue for exploration, which is the underlying driving force behind the storie's development. I personally felt this to be rather intuitive, and there was only one door in the entire game I kept revising to see if I'd uncovered some way to open it, but it was made very clear that this door had nothing to do with the actual story development.That is pretty much it, the game has an overall simple, elegant beauty that will leave those 7 hours feeling like 2, at the most.Now I must address the ending as, while it was satisfactory, it didn't leave me feeling fully accomplished small but crucial plot spoilers to follow.Dear devellopers, again, I loved the game, the ending was almost perfect, almost. Most of the game focused heavily on involving the player, and I can't help but feel like I'm missing out, as I wasn't involved in the after story. If you could maybe patch in a small expansion, which lets the player continue an otherwise finished story, and explore the various environments in their restored state, I would love you.I propose that any player choosing to continue a finished game starts out at moms (that would make me feel sooo good, as it's clear Ori witnisses the after story), which is then added into the world map. From there the player can explore a fully restored world, but is presented with a small unique twist; areas containing un-looted treasure remain corrupted by the imbalance of power, until the player has found their way to those items. This would leave those individual challenges open to accomplishment, and adds a finality to the player's sense of accomplishment once they have been aquired, while otherwise letting us romp about in this beautifull little dream world you've created."

It's a rare thing nowadays, it seems.Skyrimcomes to mind, but before that, such a feeling was but a distant memory in my long history of playing video games. So imagine my surprise when such a sensation burst forth from my brain, evoked by a $20 2D action-platformer, the trailer for which I had only seen a day or two earlier. By my definition, it was a impulse buy through and through, butOri and the Blind Forestdelivers what it promises and more.Ori and the Blind Forestis proof that the 2D genre is alive and kicking. It weaves a vibrant story with memorable characters and solid gameplay in a perfect manner. The writing, combat, music, platforming and puzzle mechanics all shine, but they do so in a memorable, profound way, a way that makes the player think about every little action they take, every jump and dash.Story and Writing10/10InOri and the Blind Forest, story drives the game and the player. That sounds like something painfully obvious, right? But having playedSuper Meat Boy,Castle Crashers,Dota 2,Battleblock Theater, etc., it's easy to see that a lot of indie games don't put such a focus on story, finding it safer instead to put it on gameplay. That's not a bad thing by any means, but it is seemingly making story-driven games more and more scarce. With only a handful of cutscenes, most of the story inOriis told as the player adventures, keeping the quick pace of the game nice and unbroken. The characters are well-designed, and though they hardly talk (some not at all), they grow on you and they stick with you. My only quip is that the story starts with a bang and ends with a bang, but never quite hits that level in between. However, if you're like me, you'll be far too busy solving puzzles and surviving to notice.Combat10/10Combat in this game is not very robust, but it works. You'll mainly be mashing one button for your longer ranged attacks. That's it. But before you shrug off that fact, know that Moon Studios has found a way to make combat interesting. InOri, you incorporate your movements into combat. Ground slams, bashing enemy projectiles back into their faces, hitting them into nearby spikes. Some sections in this game are so much fun just because of how mobile you can be when clearing areas of baddies. In fact, mobility during combat is key in many parts of the game, as some enemy attacks can be difficult to dodge, even more so with treacherous terrain surrounding you, so picking which skills to use and when, and executing them quickly and effectively definitely matters.Platforming10/10As fun as the combat is, the platforming is the meat ofOri. And one can tell it's what most of Moon's resources were spent on. Ori himself leaps and glides around the screen like he's made of wind, but he still feels weighted enough that recognizing clearable chasms and reachable ledges is incredibly easy. But just as you get used to your limits, you stumble upon a new skill, and now new paths are opened and new methods of traversal and combat are available. This repeats and repeats and before you know it, you're a master at navigating the treacherous terrain so much so that it feels like second nature. And it feels amazing. Just be sure to look before leaping off a ledge into the unknown, as dying is quite easy, and respawning back at a save point you made ten minutes ago is not fun.Puzzles10/10I have to give this a ten, just because the puzzles, like the combat, have movement at their core. You won't be sitting at some tedious tile-shuffling minigame or some nonsense like that. No, you'll see part of a keystone at the top of an impossibly tall ledge, and wonder how in the world you're expected to reach it. You know you can, as you need that item to progress, so you start looking around. Eventually, you'll see some detail you didn't quite notice on your initial scan of the area, and your brain will click in an ever so satisfying way. And off you'll go.Music10/10The beautiful orchestrated score forOri and the Blind Forest, composed by Gareth Coker, uses sounds of piano, strings, drums and wind instruments to pull you into the forest and keep you there. The sad tones will make you tear up, and the crescendos will make your skin shudder and your heart race. To me, it makes the world come alive, and it complements the game in every conceivable way. If you play the game muted (I don't know who in their right mind would), then you are missing a major part of the experience. And yes, I gladly bought the soundtrack on impulse as well.Ori and the Blind Forestis masterfully made, and I was surprised that this is Moon's first official release. Still, there as some things to note.Some might sayOri and the Blind Forestis too short. Casually playing though the story and achieving ~80% completion took me about 4-6 hours. However, I now have 15 hours clocked and counting. I just can't get enough of this game.Saving is different, but welcome. InOri, players use acquired energy to save the game. No energy means no saving, so conservation of resources is definitely a bit of strategy, at least in the beginning. Later on, as you build up your energy meter and reduce the cost of your abilities, it gradually becomes a non-issue, though you will still sometimes forget to save, only to let your guard down, fall to your doom or misjudge a dodge, and respawn where you were 20 minutes ago. You will then mentally kick yourself and immediately begin your trek back to where you met your demise, this time making sure to save.Several enemy types return throughout the game as reskinned versions of previous enemies, but rest assured that you will be fighting new types of foes all the way up until the final area.There is no New Game Plus mode (yet). At the time of writing this, Mood Studios is planning to add such a mode, as well as some bug fixes, in a future update, at least according to their Twitter account. To be clear, I did not experience any crashing or bugs that affected the game in any way, either with the game or my gamepad, though I have seen game-breaking bugs being reported on the forums.Ori and the Blind Forestis a masterpiece, pieced together so exquisitely that it stands as a testament to what the 2D style can accomplish, both in terms of fun and of story. It's a wonder to play, to watch, and to listen to. If you like anything about the trailers, the screenshots, this review, or other reviews, you owe it to yourself to try it. It is unlike anything you've experienced before, and you will not regret it."

My answer?  Well, it's simple: I never wanted it to end.  Back in 2013 around E3 time, my eyes fell upon the first look that gamers got of the beautiful art style of Ori.  Not much else besides what it looked like, but I was already hyping this game.  Most of the time, I don't hype for most games end up being disappointments in a way, but I can say that Ori was not one of those games.  Gameplay is solid, brings forward difficulty to test your wits, outstanding music, gorgeous art style, emotional story telling (I cried about 5 to 6 times).  Everything that makes a Metroidvania style game successful is here in Ori, even if the mechanics aren't necessarily groundbreaking.  It's like the saying goes: If it ain't broken, don't fix it.  Ori went the safer route and turned an average to above average Metroidvania style game and turned it into a masterpiece.Already on Top 10 of 2015.  Way to go, Moon Studios!"

Beautiful visuals and a chill soundtrack.Throughout the game you will enter different areas which differ greatly from an artistic point of view as well as game mechanics. Since you acquire new abilities while you progress, areas become more accessible and you'll find more upgrades and power-ups. It felt really 'Metroid'-ish, really nicely done and absolutely the kind of game I like.As already mentioned above, you will have 9 abilities which you acquire the further you progress in the game such as double jump, jump of a wall, walk along the wall, power dash, stomp attack and more. Besides these 9 you can upgrade your character with optional skills such as stronger attacks, better defense, multiple enemy attack, magnetic aura to pick up power-ups and many more. The skill tree is divided into 3 branches with about 10 upgrades each. So quite a lot to do and to discover.The story is simple but gripping: You need to save the forest and along the way you encounter other characters which have their own plans and opinions about the forest's situation.The different enemy types are well done. Each has its own attack pattern and therefore you need to approach them all in a different manner - especially at the beginning since you haven't learned all the abilites yet.Besides all the different areas (around 6 if i am not mistaken), you will have to fight yourself through 3 main dungeons which are fairly tough and include challening jumping sections (in combinition with the abilities you've learned) which do not allow any mistakes. Some players found them to be rather difficult ... but with a bit of patience you shall be victorious. I am glad these difficult parts haven been put into the game, otherwise it would lack a bit of punch.All the crashes and bugs which some of the people address, I can't comment on - my game didn't crash a single time, nor were there frame drops or other technical issues. So the performance was throughout flawless during my gameplay.The only negative aspect of the game is the fact, that you can't return to the game-world after completing the final dungeon. So all the upgrades and other energy orbs you haven't collected before then, are lost forwever. This is a HUGE downer in my opinion. Being at 99% completion this bothers me greatly. I wouldn't have an issue with this if it would be stated CLEARLY that you won't be able to return to your game after finishing the last dungeon.Some great easter eggs are found in the game ... for examplea Triforce carved into a hollow tree or a green pipe from Super Mario which can be found underwater covered in algae9 out of 10for the Heart of Darkness vibe I've got while playing and the GOOD plattformer mechanics (like Metroid/Castlevania/Strider/Shadow Complex)."

I'll probably play through a 2nd and a 3rd time at least.

I will say as a nod to the story, if you do not enjoy a story that is very heart focused instead of cerebral I'd simply say to ignore the story and focus on the gameplay. The game itself had me dying, a great deal in fact, but no matter how often I died, cursed, or wanted to punch the little white lemur/thing I never gave up. The last level itself is an act of frustration as the game demands you play it through multiple times to figure out the quirks, but I will also say it is blessedly short with an ending that had me smiling. I will not my favorite area was the water zone, as the last level of it had me both amazed, and irritated throughout my playing of it, but again at no time did I stop or get so frustrated I'd simply put it down. I played, and played, and played until I beat the area, then stopped because of the first mentioned hand cramps. Worth the money spent on it, will definitely be playing it again, and I would say if you have an interest pick it up, or if you want to wait for a sale, go for it it'll be worth whatever you pay for it."

,Recommended,261570,15236207,"Posted: 6 April, 2015",all,blue_serenade,"So, I normally don't write reviews of any kind, but after playing this game, I feel inclined to do just that.It's because this is the sort of thing that pushes my motivation to come out and openly recommend this fantastic masterpiece of a videogame to all of you. I feel it fully deserves the attention and praise it gets.First of all, this platformer has some of the most beautifully crafted artwork and animation. In fact, it looks just like a Miyazaki movie with all the brightly colored backgrounds and designs. Ori reminded me very much of the ghostly figures in, what was it, Mononoke-hime? The opening of Ori and the Blind Forest almost had me in tears, it's that well done.Considering that this game has been worked on for 4 whole years, I cannot say I'm surprised.The gameplay: It's difficult at times, but it's postively challenging and never unfair. When you make mistakes, the game will let you know. The great thing is, the game is never rage-inducing and through the calm and soothing atmosphere, you can't really get mad at anything other than yourself.I for one never had any trouble with the controls, they are very fluent and to the point. They're easy to learn, but hard to master. But it is such joy and fun learning to play around with the game's engine to reach all the areas and collectibles in OatBF. Collecting all the life and energy cells gets addicting very quickly, since you can spend those to unlock further skills on your three-branched skilltree. Also, you feel f*ckin' invincible when you manage to complete it and learn all the different moves you can unlock throughout the game.It's safe to say that if you first start the game, it could be a bit overwhelming as the backgrounds and the forefront of your screen (although easy to differentiate) seem to mix and blend in more than once when there's lots of action. And you'll certainly die a lot if you don't know what to do (especially at the beginning). Mostly it's about skill, but there's some trial and error thrown into it, too, although never frustrating.I can't say how playing Ori feels like with a controller, because I opted to play with a mouse and keyboard. Might be harder for some, but I think people will manage easily if they get used to it and grasp the feel of the controls. As I said, gameplay's fluent and doesn't get in the way of enjoying everything else.The story of OatBF may be a bit unoriginal (and I still don't want to spoil anything), but it's so well executed. The feels are strong in this one, the imagery and the sounds will blow you away and leave you with very many emotions ranging from ultimate joy to extreme sadness. In short, it leaves its mark on your heart. And if it doesn't, I don't know what will.But as lovely as Ori and the Blind Forest is, it would not be the same without the excellent and truly memorable orchestrated music by Gareth Coker. This, apart from the story, makes buying the game a must! After finishing it, I sat there crying a lot (others felt the same, apparently, because everyone keeps telling that).A con to all these pros is very hard to imagine, but it I HAD to say something negative, it'd be the relative shortness of 8-12 hours of gameplay, but even THEN it's still just a platformer and I was glad the duration was kept this way as to not overstay its welcome. It's short, but to the point. Not one minute of this game was wasted and I would very much play this time and time again, for it's one of the very best videogames I have EVER played."

It feels good to move Ori around the screen.The graphics and music are gorgeous.The metroidvania mechanics are paced well.The story is good. Though the most moving part is the introductory level.The difficulty is good. It's not so hard that it's impossible to finish, but it's also hard enough that you feel good to beat it.The escape sequences are difficult since you can't save during them. Basically you have to complete them about 70/80/90% perfect (the later the escape sequence the more perfect you need to do it), especially the final escape sequence. They almost feel like they are too long without giving you the ability to make a checkpoint, but then you beat it and you think, ""well, actually that was just about right.""I finished it in about 12 hours, but about 4 of those hours were either sitting in the pause menue while I talked to my wife or washed dishes, or they were spent backtracking to collect powerups. So when people say that the game can be beaten in about 8 hours, they're not wrong.But you know? That's just about perfect. I'm an adult, I don't have 60, 80, or 120 hours to spend on a game. I want to finish the game and collect all the powerups in a weekend or two. 8 to 16 hours is just about perfect for my schedule, and at $20 I feel that I got my money's worth.

The art direction is beautiful with a soundtrack to match, and the story itself is an uplifting one. The beauty is that while the perspective is personal and the motivations simple, instinctual, even, the scope and reach of your actions are grand indeed.The platforming gets demanding, but the controls are spot-on. Combat is simple and is not the focus of this game, but more options eventually open up. Being able to set a difficulty level would have been nice for the young ones, and keys are not rebindable, but it's otherwise everything one could ask for in a modern metroidvania. The developers have put a lot of heart into this game and it shows.Do pick this one up. It's a gem."
76561197973212819,Recommended,261570,14903876,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,chronomodra,"Honestly, this is the first game of 2015 that I can say is pretty much a must-have.If you enjoy the 'metroidvania' style of games, where you explore a world unlocked by new skills and abilities, then this is right up your alley.  If you enjoy platformers at all, this is also an extremely responsive and thrilling jaunt. But even if these games are not in your wheelhouse, I would still recommend this game for its beauty and polish.This game is not 'pretty' in the same sense that graphically-intensive first person shooters with lots of texture detail are pretty.  It is beautiful in an artistic sense, bringing back memories of Dust: an Elysian Tail and Okami, where every creature and environment is presented to you with a flourish.  The music is perfect, supporting the story in moments of sorrow, excitement, and awe, and would be wonderful to listen to even if it weren't making each scene better.Speaking of the story, it manages to be simple and unintrusive while still providing depth and emotion.  You don't spend much time in cutscenes where you can't control your character; instead you learn about the world around you through exploration and brief comments from the narrator or your spirit allies.  Much like Wall-E, you will find yourself empathizing with characters who have tugged at your heartstrings without uttering a single word.That comparison is actually rather apt, as this game has about the same accessability as a pixar movie: everyone can enjoy it, yet no one will ever tell you it's just for kids.If I had any criticism of this game, it's that you may get a framerate hitch or two depending on your machine, but those are infrequent enough that they don't mess up the gameplay. And some people might get frustrated if they're not used to getting through platformer challenges through death, trial, and error. But even the hardest parts of this game are at the same time thrilling, as you race through tunnels while avoiding tidal waves or falling rocks while the amazing music urges you on.So in short, get the game.  The only way I can see someone not enjoying this game is if they don't like video games at all.  And for some people like that, I think it might even change their minds."
,Recommended,261570,14903886,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,Enot,"I can't recommend this game enough. It's what a real next-gen should be: old formulas working with a new technology. At it's core Ori is an old school platformer with some tweaks. You navigate the world, occasionally solve puzzles and fight enemies. Battle mechanic is done in an interesting way: it promotes agility over everything. You just try to avoid enemies while your homing missiles do damage. It could be fun, but a bit repetitive. Not that repetition is a bad thing if it's satisfying. RPG system is simple and straightforward, and it's not a bad thing at all. The only lacking part is story, but I guess it's not as important as everything else.Solid 9.5/10, second good game this year.Pros:* Stunningly beautiful. Arguably the best looking 2D game ever.* Charming soundtrack.* Very well done platforming.* Atmospheric forest.* Decent difficulty.* Outstanding immersive capabilities.* Straightforward skill tree.* Sometimes you think ""Oh, I can't get there"" and then after a couple of minutes trying you just do it. Satisfying as hell.Cons:* Somewhat sluggish wall jump.* No story engagement, just a bunch of random dialogues.* Difficulty can be unforgiving for casual players."

,Recommended,261570,14904538,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,CJ,"I just finished the story, so here is my review:Pros:- Flawless and outstanding presentation in graphics, sound and gameplay.- Interesting foreign world with mystical creatures.- Story is there, but not throwing itself in my face, but not boring either.- Without focus on completing it 100% you get around 6 hours of fun, which is perfectly fine for the price, considering the overall quality of the game. They could have easily charged more for this.Cons:- Finishing the story locks the savegame from loading, so you can't 100% this game after the final story scene.Ori and the Blind Forest is an outstanding side scrolling jump'n run by Microsoft Studios. You can very clearly see that there has been put a lot of work into this game. The controls are tight and super precise, it's a lot of fun maneuvering Ori around. The soundtrack is just wonderful, always underlining the current scene and adding to the overall experience. From a graphical standpoint it is stunning, the devs really know how to make engaging scenes. You will not be bothered with graphical glitches or sickening color schemes, everything is beautifully rendered, the colors are harmonizing perfectly well. And the story is as mystical as the world itself. Most people have seen the death scene of the big guy. Let me tell you that the ninjas cutting onions retreat after that, maybe one returns at the end of the game, but altogether this game isn't an emotional rollercoaster. After said scene the game focuses on the main plot and game goals.Ori and the Blind Forest feels like a love letter to Metroid fans. You unlock passive abilities during the journey, where the upgrades are often sort of hidden and have to be picked up. As an addition you can level up Ori, gaining new powers and active abilites, while maintaining a nice balance to not make it too easy or too hard. Some of the platforming scenes are a bit more difficult than the rest (you'll recognize them while playing) and require very, very precise movement of the player. It may be a bit frustrating from time to time, but at the end it's all very doable.Here's my one big complaint: after completing the story, you can not go back into the savegame to get 100% (all abilites, max level). The save game just gets locked. I hope they're patching this, I'm not okay with playing an additional 6 hours just to get to the same point and completing it."
,Recommended,261570,14882801,"Posted: 14 March, 2015",all,Bastwood,"Very pretty all of the time and very hard some of the time, Ori and the Blind Forest is a 2D open-world platformer that is all about solving increasingly complex traversal problems with an ever-expanding array of special moves and skills. There's a fair share of combat as well, but for most of the time you'll be battling the environment and the elements.The bright, colorful graphics might lead you to think Ori being a game aimed primarily for children. Well, while kids probably will enjoy it, make no mistake: This is a hardcore platformer, not a casual stroll through the enchanted forest. Your mastery of Ori's mechanics and systems will be tested thoroughly, and there's no easy mode to switch to when going gets rough. Some of the sections rely a bit too much on having to memorize the level layout via trial & error, but you can save almost everywhere and replaying huge areas doesn't become too annoying.Ori is one of the best-looking platformers out there, with lots of environmental variety and smoothly flowing animations. The controls are quite floaty but responsive enough for the precision that is required; Everything feels well laid out to the gamepad (you'll definitely need one). The grand orchestral score has few memorable tracks, one of which is probably a bit overused, but it fits the mood so I can't complain too much.Satisfying length and AAA-budget visuals for an indie price. Not bad at all."

The world feels extremely cohesive and even things like the fluid controls and fighting style seem to add to the themes of curiosity and exploration the game employs. My only gripe with the game is that, at some points, it is quite difficult to accomplish what is asked in terms of platforming and in a lot of these cases, you can't move on in the game unless you complete the given task.The game is good; you'll probably like it no matter what.

Then I watched the trailer on Steam and immediately I knew I HAD to get this game. Did I have any regrets? NOT AT ALL.This game has an extremely beautiful graphical art with really soothing music that eases your mind and leaves you (well me at least) in awe as you look at the breath-taking view of the backgrounds that it has in different areas you go. The story is simple yet enjoyable. Using the right music with the right atmosphere at the right places, it brings out a lot of mixed feelings as I play through and watch the short cutscenes it has. There are even times where I simply can't help but feel emotional and cry as I progress with the story.Controls in the game are simple and easily adaptable. Exploration is fun and interesting, yet can be challenging sometimes when there are harmful stuff all over like spikes, monsters getting in your way, etc etc. Also, it has hidden areas which you can stumble into finding collectibles / upgrades (I guess?) for your skills, which you obtain as you progress through the story.This is not a professional review, just a personal thought turned into words.Will I recommend this game to anyone?

76561197970509989,Recommended,261570,14854899,"Posted: 12 March, 2015",all,SirSquirelyMcKnight,"Note:  I've tried to write this review as spoiler free as possible.It's not often that I write a review about a game but Ori and the Blind Forest deserves recognition.  Ori and the Blind Forest is a platform adventure video game designed by Moon Studios, an independent developer, and published by Microsoft Studios.Moon Studios wastes no time in opening up the story. Reminiscent to the movie ""Up"", you are introduced to two characters who you are intended to quickly fall in love with as you join them in their personal story of friendship.  When the bond between these two characters is solidified,  that's when disaster strikes and the true journey and story begins.  This tradgedy is the emotional undercurrent as a quest is formed on how to resolve the crisis at hand and perhaps more.One can not think back on this game without seeing how Moon Studios took its design influence from Studio Ghibli both in emotional tones and artistic design.  There are also a lot of similarities between this game and Child of Light, Trine, and the grandfather of all platformers Super Metroid.  None of these similarities are a bad thing.  It takes the greatest aspects of all of these and rolls them up into one cohesive design that I imagine I'll be gushing about to my friends for a long while.Art:   10 / 10Technically masterful when one considers how their use of lighting can almost give the illusion that the 2d landscape starts to shape into 3d, even with the use of it's parallax.  Particle effects are equally stunning and fitting.  Character animations are top notch which conveys the story and message Moon Studios is trying to tell.As an illustrator and conceptual design artist myself by trade it's easy to look at your work and always think ""I could do more and make this better"" but alas,  you have to put your art down and just move on.  The fidelity and quality requires no extra work.  It's polished,  refined and displayed beautifully.  Many games you find yourself rushing to the end but I'd be suprised if anyone is capable of rushing without stopping occasionally to smell the flowers here and soak in all it's artistry.Music:   9 / 10Orchestrated and robust in it's depth.  You're being given the full package here which is going to hint at very different emotionally driven states.  Anger,  fear,  sadness and joy can all be found within the music,  but also a sense of wonder and tranquility.I didn't however pick up on any trendy tunes that I'll remember for a lifetime.  That isn't to say that its necessary for a great soundtrack to be rememberable.  It's a beautiful score that'll leave you in a meditative state and that is the bottom line.Gameplay: 8 / 10The game has 2 major methods of character development.  You have 9 major skills such as the ability to jump off of walls as most typical platformers do.  However the game always seems to find a way to keep upping the ante.  You'll have to think fast,  pay attention and occasionally puzzle solve using everything at your disposal without heavily rellying on any particular skill and burning out on repition.Then you have ability points which can be earned by destroying baddies.  This particular aspect of the game I felt came in a bit weak.  You earn points,  you spend them,  you upgrade your abilities.  Sounds great but you can also find skill points hidden through out the game.  The problem with this is that you could just as easily go back to a previous area and farm creatures to get enough points to get the skills you desire anyways which lessens the importance of finding hidden items.At it's heart Ori and the Blind Forest is about adventure and the majority of it's obstacles and puzzes are based around how one can get from point A to point B.Plenty of secrets to be found for the adventurous (not all of which are related to ability points thankfully) which is wonderful considering all the fantastic artwork there is to look at.  The game doesn't introduce a whole lot that hasn't been done already but what it does, it does very well.  Many ideas that platformer gamers might recognize as staples will have particular twists to them and I found just about all of these changes to be a joy.Conclusion 9.6 / 10Ori and the Blind Forest should be in every serious video gamers libary.  I have a very broad scope and opinion of what I constitute as art seeing how as I'm an artist.  However,  very few, even those with limited understanding of the philisophical question of ""what is art?"" will walk away from this thinking ""I've just witnessed a masterpiece"".  What better praise could I possibly give?"

I have played this part for the last 45 mins and I feel like it ruins my experience of the game.It doesn't matter how fast you go, the water will be at your back. It's like it's scripted for every section and doesn't reward you with a little bit of time for doing the section perfectly. It also keeps messing me up because the energy slingshot decides that it's not going to work by letting me fall to my death or the enemies don't react to my presence fast enough to shoot the enrgy. My first impressions were 9/10. After playing the game for longer, the clunkiness of the controls starts to get irritating so I'd give it a 7/10 now.It's a fun action platformer, probably not worth the money though. I'd reccomend it when it's cheaper, like around £6 but apart from great visuals the gameplay isn't as polished enough for the price tag in my opinion.I will attempt to beat it but I'm not spending forever on one part that feels like the game mechanics are working against me rather than me making mistakes."

The gameplay is what you expect from a competent metroidvania type game. It is responsive and flows quite nicely. With plenty of combinations and high speed gameplay you get a real sense of achievement when you get through an action sequence after several tries. And this is where things start to fall apart for me.The gameplay flows so smoothly and quickly you do not have time to study all the work that goes into the background. At least at no point does it feel distracting - not to me anyway. But when everything goes by so quickly, stopping to study the backgrounds and looking at the environments breaks the flow of the game and a nice pace comes to a screeching halt. And there are a lot of details.As for the story, it is what it is. I did not find it a deep narrative. And at a few points I do feel the game condescended to me as if I was too dense to follow the story. Keeping it spoiler free the worst offender was after a cutscene that showed the motivation of an antogonist. After the cutscene the same motivation, that was clear as day and shoved in your face, is told to you in text explicitly within the game. The rule ""show, don't tell,"" is thus not followed, and it feels like the game thinks the player is that dense.I get the central themes of it all, but it is delivered so explicitly with a lot of repitition to ensure you absolutely know what is going on, that it leaves nothing to the imagination. The game's puzzles served as the only motivation for me personally to move forward, just to prove to the game that, yes, I am smart enough to do this. And I do not believe this is what the game sets out to do. It delivers a narrative and I find thet delivery stunning, but the narrative mediocre. And I personally do not find the narrative that deep and engaging. Call me jaded if you like.Not to mention that the ending was heavily prompted. No surprises and that left me disappointed.To sum up, I recommend this. For what it is and the price I feel I got the value in return I expected. It is a beautifully presented so-and-so narrative. This is not looking to be a GOTY contender for me. Not even close. 7/10"

,Recommended,261570,14908707,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,Andrige,"Its one of these games that you really should play. It nails the execution of building a living and moving world that is gorgeous to look at, it has some seriously tight platforming sections that thrill without frustrating due to its clever checkpoint system.The abilities you get to play with unlocks rapidly, and each newfound power stacks so nicely with the previous ones that by the half-point of the game you have a plethora of ways to move around and react to enemy encounters. I can praise the gameplay, atmosphere and the wordless cutscenes from the main cast of characters that evoked serious emotions.My personal gripes with the game is that the early game feels a bit sluggish, and enemy encounters during that time are cumbersome and actually designed for the set of skills you get later on. I am also a bit saddened that there's no way for me to know more about the world itself through reading, or having spoken interactions with NPCs. Its elegant in its current form - for sure - but I would have so much wanted more nuggets of lore to spice up my immersion. I've found some scribbles on the walls though in hidden areas, so I could very well be just wrong, but they seemed inconsequential at the time I played and not really cohesive enough to form a narrative I could follow.All in all, just get this title. You'll be challenged, you'll get a bit teary, you'll be blown away by the visuals and you'll master the gameplay intuitively using some of the most fun platforming abilities I've had the joy to use in a game of this type."

The levels are cleverly designed although some are extremely difficult. It's a bit like Super Meat Boy or Dark Souls in the sense that you just need to keep dying and trying until you get it right. The gameplay takes existing ideas and really refines them. The controls feel floaty sometimes, but I don't see any way to get around this without taking away the freedom of movement that is key to the gameplay so I can't criticize.My only drawback on this game is that it is TOO beautiful. Eventually your eyes get used to the art and you stop seeing it, and only pay attention to the mechanics... which is an injustice, considering how incredible the art is.

Doesn't intrude on game play too much, either. Soundtrack: absolutely fantastic. Combat: Quite enjoyable. Some enemies feel a bit spongy when you only use the default attack, but the flexibility that the movement system gives you, turns brawling into a frantic display of acrobatics. You can bounce off of any enemy and most projectiles, if timed correctly, twisting bullet-hell-like situations into you jumping between enemies and redirecting projectiles until nothing is left standing.I'm not exactly an expert at platformers and find the game quite challenging in places. In no way is this a casual adventure. You'll have to time your jumps, angle your double jumps and be on the lookout for walls to latch onto.The game does have an intriguing save point mechanic: At the cost of an energy point, you place the checkpoints yourself. Scary looking spiked pit? Place a save point, try to get across, grab the ability point on the other side, get back and save again. Fantastic. Beware though: apart from boss battles and certain cutscenes, the game does very little auto saving. You are pretty much in control of where you'll respawn if things go sideways.In my opinion easily one the best games of 2015. If you're even remotely interested in platform/action games, buy it."

Some years later you discover the tree was dying and crying for Ori to return. At this point the forest went ""blind"" without the magical light provided from the Ancient Tree and life around started to rot. Naru ends up fainting from starvation and Ori once again find itself alone. After crawling into the woods with his last strenght he discover the Ancient Tree was taken over by some kind of fungus and with it's last breath he infuse his light on it and life starts to flourish around them again. The Ancient Tree then explains that when Ori never came back the forest lost its hope and the evil took over the elements that once balanced life around the tree and now Ori needs to bring the balance back.The game is great visually, lots of great sceneries and full of stunning light/sound effects. The levels are nicely done and the controls works very well, and this is comming from someone who beat the entire game using a VAIO laptop keyboard. I'd say you should play Ori and the Blind Forest and here is why:Ori is a simple game, how simple? Just think about the Aladdin / Dk games from SNES, it's basically the same: 2Dish game with a protagonist that needs to get somewhere and save someone, Ori even have escape levels very similar to the rug steering level in Aladdin (prepare to die a million times) and secret map areas that can only be acessed with some tough nerve to get into dangerous areas (DK much?).The big difference is in the level design, while in most games levels are done separately without interaction with one another Ori's levels are conected like a big cave. This adds the feeling that you are not exploring it right at the beginning since the map has areas you cannot access without upgrading Ori's abillities. Therefore you will find yourself going back and forth inside caves you already have been to to find new areas and items.It took me 9 hours to finish Ori and The Blind Forest and I got almost every item from the game (98% completed) and now after everything is done the only thing I wish is that there were more levels to play or that I could get back inside previous areas to finish what I missed.THE FINAL VEREDICTStory:8.5Controls:9.0Levels:8.0Difficulty:7.0Pros:-Beautiful game-Controls works very well-Free will to explore-Checkpoint mechanics are amazingCons:-Too short-Some areas give you only one chance to get all the items beore becoming unaccessible-Some in game scenes made me cry (I was a little drunk)"

No one area, dungeon, creature, or wisp of magnificent light overstays it's welcome, as everything in the forest always seems to be changing and in flux.Visual jawdropping factor aside, Ori would still be a joy to play if it were hideous, and that makes it beautiful in an entirely different scope. Metroidvania gameplay describes it only in the facet that it is indeed a 2-D platformer, and there is backtracking for previously locked areas after obtaining a new skill. With a much bigger focus on movement options (including double and triple jumping, gliding, wall jumping, superjumping, wall-superjumping, and more) Ori is wholly unique in its approach to  environmental combat and evasion as a weapon.Health and energy upgrades are fairly plentiful if you are curious and delicate in your exploration. I also found that accessing certain upgrades before they were intended is actually possible in a few areas, via some extremely precise jumps and wall clings. This freedom of exploration, along with extraordinarily well paced ability unlocks and a solid ""talent"" or ability tree to level up allows Ori expand in a satisfying way.If there is one gripe that some players may levee at the game it would probably be in some of the boss ""escape"" sequences where there is a reasonable difficulty spike. These sections essentially require you to die a few times while you feel out the layout of the escape. For most players this shouldn't be a problem on the first playthrough and will only take a couple minutes. Players who may be looking at Ori as an art exhibit on the other hand may find these sections too difficult. Also I recommend a controller, but for most platformers I would anyway.Ori and the Blind Forest is a game that manages to actually balance art, story, level design, solid mechanics, innovative aspects, and an overall feel good experience that many people will find reason to play multiple times. Moon Studios deserves a big pat on the back and job well done, for Ori is a shining example of game design in 2015. Enjoy."

Controls are intuitive and your repertoire of abilities are oh-so-satisfying to pull off when you get your timing and reflexes right. The developers did a good job of making sure that each time you learn a new ability, that using it like a pro comes to you as second nature by the time you learn the next one.At some climactic parts of the story, your timing and precision with your abilities will be put to the test and they have been the highlights for me so far.What can I say.

Exceptionally memorable and beautifully realized, it's certianly an adventure worth taking.This review is spoiler free.tl;dr is at the bottom.Narrative+Heartfelt and emotional.+Endearing characters.+Beautiful ending.-Narration can get a bit akward.The prologue sets the stage beautifully, laying down the groundwork for the motivations and character you control. Ori is a guardian spirit that went astray from the Spirit Tree and happened into the care of loving mother Naru, whose design is reminicent of Studio Ghibli favorites ala Totoro crossed with No-Face of Spirited Away fame. A call to action sets Ori on his quest to restore the decaying forest once more. The story throughout is very much a heroes journey that culminates into a heart breaking finale that's sure to jerk a tear from an eye or two. It's story book presentation and sense of innocence make this tale light hearted and whimsical while touching on heavy concepts that elevate it above a generic tale for childeren. Because of this, its easy for anyone to get invested in the world and characters. Dialogue is kept to a strict minimum, with only 2 characters providing exposition. Sein is the floating blue companion to Ori and provides immediate exposition on Ori's current surroundings and goals. The other being the Spirit Tree himself acting as narration in key segments of the game. The tree narrates the prologue which sets the tone beautifully. The way the narration was written it's as if the game is a story being told by the tree to an audience. But those narration segments post prologue are so few and far between that once they pop up, its a bit jarring and akward when you are reminded that they exist. Some segments I feel would have been significantly more impacting were there only actions and no words, specifically at the end. Aside from that, the narrative is simple, emotional, and heartfelt through and through.Gameplay+Familiar foundation with RPG elements.+Challenging.+Metroidvania elements.-Boss segments clash in tone and gameplay.The gameplay will be immediately familiar to anyone who grew up with Nintendo in the 80s/90s. The game is set in a very large exploreable map but access is limited all around the different areas depending on what abilities Ori is able to use. As you progress through the game, you get access to abilities that allow you to enter unexplored areas of old maps that you couldnt get to before. These abilities are also cleaverly worked into the design of every room. Combat is simplistic but flashy and powerful in execution. Your main attack is a homing short range projectile that hits your closest enemy, but you gain other usefull abilities that can be used in combat such as a ground pound and a charged blast. Your attacks are also upgradable via a skill tree which you use to unlock improvements to your abilities through leveling up or finding orbs that grant you a point to use. Ori also has an enegry resource. This energy is used to power certian attacks or create Soul Links which are the save points. Tying the save feature to an energy resource puts extra emphesis on energy management. Do you save your energy for that powerful attack now or place a soul link for that extra security? It adds an interesting element of risk to using energy for early game, but when you are sufficently equiped in skills and energy extensions. Soul Links are hardly a risk anymore. The gameplay is fun, engaging, and introduces new mechanics at a healthy pace to keep interest.The one complaint I have for the gameplay, and perhaps my biggest one for the whole game, is the boss fight segments. They are all trial and error encounters to the bone. They do test aquired knowledge and abilities like any good final level should but do so in such a way that it's very unlikely you will complete these levels without a few deaths at the very least. Now this wouldn't be so bad were it not for the tone these segments were going for. These encounters try to be the most emotionally driving parts of the game. A grand bombastic orchestral piece blasts through your speakers as the background changes, scenery gets destroyed, set pieces galore and wonderful camera shakes. It's all extremely dramatic and exciting. But it all falls flat because of the trial and error mechanics of these levels. As a result of repeating of the same actions over and over, any sense of urgency and emotional drive in regards to the story and characters iscompletelylost amidst the repitition and frustration of dying to a instant kill rock you had no idea was there or couldnt even see it until it already landed on your face. The Micheal Bay set piece is the worst environment to force a player to do precision platforming because there's too much going on  to see what you need to do and it ends up being annoying, completely ripping me out of the story every time. And each encounter ends with an emotional and plot relevant cutscene but by that time, im still fuming over the stupid instant kill rocks. It's like trying to combine Super Meat Boy with Okami. It just doesnt work. After each of the encounters, I personally took a few minutes to rewatch the prologue to the game on youtube to get back into the story.Visuals+Georgeous.+Very fluid and dynamic.+Beautiful pseudo 3D effects.Not much to say about this. If you have seen a screen shot, you know exactly what you are in for. The environment of the levels are dynamic. Foilage sways back from the wind as you run past it. Water ripples from the tinyest drop. The color is so vivid and bright yet never oversaturated. It all makes for one of the most visually appealing worlds I've seen in a game in a very long time. An utter joy to look at and play in. Environments are also nicely varried. Mostly taking place in a forest (obviously) you explore decaying woodlands, lush swamps, damp and murky caves, and more. They all feel uniqe and maintain their own identity. For a single forest, there is a lot of variety and it's all incredible.Audio+Fantastic orchestral score+Great sound effects and voice work.I'll keep this one brief as well. The music is fantastic, easily one of the best and surprisingly memorable I've heard in video games. It makes itself a defining melody it uses throughout the game in certian key points easily establishing its identity to be remembered from. Emotionally intense pieces are fittingly dramatic and bombastic, while somber and heartbreaking pieces complement the cutscenes very nicely. What little voice work in the game is also well done, being entirely in gibberish making the world feel alien enough for the characters to be identified as non-human but still relateable and sympathetic. Small touches such as Ori's high pitched gasp for air when he breaks the surface of water plus the powerful sounds of combat moves makes it all feel much more real and engaging. It all adds to the top notch presentation this game brings.RecommendationOri and the Blind Forest was welcomed experience for me. It doesnt bring anything new to the table, but it doesnt need to. What it does bring is finely crafted and engaging to any platform enthusiest. Those who grew up on old platformers of the 80s/90s will get a special dose of nostalgia with the game as well. It's an immensley entertaining, heart warming, and challenging journey that anyone with the slightest interest in the game should not miss.Recommended at current full price.TL;DR*Gameplay is finely done and challenging. Action platformer with RPG and metroidvania elements.*The art is incredible and the music is memorable.*Emotinally driven heart felt story with a sympathetic cast.*Trial and error with Micheal Bay cam can be annoying and rip you out of the story."

The game is made challenging due to the controls I would recommend using a gamepad. Apart from the controls being out for blood, the art in this game is simply astounding, I was in awe for the first ten minutes of the game losing my self in the soundtrack and the impressive visuals. This was until the combat kicked in it turned from a nice nature trip into a furious button mashing overload of the senses, I personally found the projectiles hard to see and even more difficult to dodge as they blend into the background. At times there was just too much going on on the screen for me to focus on anything so I wound up dying repeatedly from not being able to see where ori was on the screen. The game gets insanely hard very quick if you don't take the time to understand a mechanic you will die a lot. As the game is of the time of this review I encountered some problems the game would cut out or pause in the middle of some cut scenes, I would lose visual in the middle of a cut scene with nothing but a light blue screen and the sounds, the game would crash 100% of the time if the screen resolution changed for any reason (alt+tab). I played the game in windowed mode this fixed almost all of the problems. The story was touching even if we had no time to see the characters or attach to them in any way the feelings they were portraying were still there and very easy to simpathise with. Over all I feel that the game was worth the money just for the outstanding music and the story.Remember this game will bend you over and show you no mercy so you need to have some patience with it.

The vivid color, graphics, animation, lighting, sound, atmosphere, and enchanting music all synchronize harmoniously to create an amazing and surreal experience that feels half like an animated movie and the other half a compelling game that invites you to explore and discover what dark and captivating secrets and challenges lie in store for Ori in the immersive forest of Nibel.Ori is a 2D platformer that uses a familiar tried-and-true Metroid-like mechanic of unlocking abilities and powers that allow you to access more of the forest areas that couldn't be reached before. However, even if that's not usually your typical game genre and gameplay of choice, there's a lot here that makes Ori feel refreshing and unlike anything you've played before. Also, the challenges, puzzles, and enemies you'll face are tricky but fair. The game also rewards you the more you step up to the challenge to dive further into the fantastical world around you and explore every nook and cranny you can. Dying is also more of an inconvenience than a serious frustration, just so long as you remember to carefully Soul Link (a unique way of quick-saving) often.In all, this game is absolutely worth every penny of the $20 and makes you feel glad to be born in an era of games like this. You can tell the creators of this game put a LOT of extra special care, attention, and dedication to every detail, aspect, and component in this game and left no piece of it carelessly forgotten or hastily neglected in their effort to make it the absolute best and most captivating experience they could create.Do yourself a favor and take the plunge. This is an enchanting and very immersive game that yearns and definitely deserves to be explored by everyone looking for a mystifyingly imaginative, sentimental, and mystical escape. Step away from the glut of first person shooters, zombie games, and simulations for a while and give Ori a chance to take you on a visually incredible journey and adventure that stays with you even after you've stepped away from the game."

And I don't just mean visually so; it is challenging and exhilarating in ways that provide intensely gratifying rewards merely from the experience of the gameplay itself, and in a time when far too many games make us trudge through various frustrations to be rewarded with some pretty cinematic or a tool that lets us trudge through slightly-more-difficult frustrations, this virtue gains even more significance.That alone would be enough to make it beautiful in my eyes, but it takes another step. Ori and the Blind Forest follows in the spiritual footsteps of Super Mario Brothers and Metroid, channeling the energy granted by a gorgeous world where the experience of each region is entirely unique and feels like its own game. That energy is conveyed along with glorious pacing, granting new, amazing abilities that center around mobility and traversing terrain. This means that the Metroid-esque backtracking is made all the more entertaining as you approach old ground with an invigorating and fresh prowess.Though it is perhaps unfair to Ori to say that it merely follows these iconic franchises -- rather, it blazes a fantastic new trail in the same direction with its beauty and execution, not merely pandering to my nostalgia, but exceeding it in ways I never thought possible. I am both thoroughly impressed and deeply moved.TL;DR -- Ori and the Blind Forest is amazing and you should play it."

Visually stunning.+The controls feel great+The platforming feels fresh despite being a proven genre. (Though that may be due to the art design.)Cons:- The Bash move could have been implemented cleaner (at least on controller)- You can't skip the in-game cutscenes that have to do with world events. (Minor annoyance.)- The difficulty sometimes changes in odd ways. I found myself breezing through some areas and getting stuck in others,"

,Recommended,261570,15442960,"Posted: 18 April, 2015",all,Tacar,"Let me start by saying that I love this game. 10/10 hands down buy it now. The art style is beautiful. The story design is raw and emotional. The controls are tight and responsive. The music is perfect for every situation. By the end I had cried, laughed, raged, and felt entirely comfortable with the controls, in that order.My only issue is that the collectables are not reachable after certian world events and that there is NO new game plus or any way to continue a game that has gone past the final fight sequence... really there is no reason for them to even keep the save. It would have completely changed the way I played the game if I had known thisbeforeI started playing, so be aware. (Not that I'm complaining too much that I have to play this amazing game a second time) If they are taking suggestions I would ask to have a way to turn off the world events after completing the game so I could go back and collect everything without having to play through the game entire."

The majority of the game play is quite entertaining and just the right difficulty level to keep you engaged and engrossed with the game.  The action sequences at the end of each realm left my heart pounding, for more than one reason -- while the action was frantic, it also proved to be frustratingly difficult, as there was little margin between success and failure, with the latter resulting in the sequence being restarted from the beginning.  Overall though, Ori and the Blind Forest is a very beautiful and enjoyable game, and I highly recommend it."
