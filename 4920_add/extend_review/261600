The tutorial is useless, loading times take forever (even with just the US league selected), and the user interface is confusing and not straight forward. The AI is also awful and at time laughable, if I hadn't just paid $19 for this garbage. If you were buying this game expecting a Football Manger game just for basketball, you will be sadly disappointed. I want my money back. To say that this is even an Alpha is a lie."

All the names are spelt incorrectly, including school names. You have to guess what team you are playing because it only tells you the town name. For college, which is the reason I got the game, there are very few options for you to do. There is training and subbing during games. That's about it. There are no fast breaks, and if rebounded down low, they always kick it back out to the point guard to set up the play again rather than just taking the post shot. I honestly wish I could get my money back. Even for simple visuals for a simulation management game, they look like something from 10 years ago. There are very few options for defense, which is something I was looking forward to utilizing in the game. I believe if you are going to release a game and put it in English, you should at least know how to spell in English first. Do not spend a dime on this game."

Barebones graphics and very limited mid-game adjustment options for the team?DO NOT BUY THIS. I wish I could get my money back....

76561197973967367,Recommended,261600,8646307,"Posted: 10 January, 2014",all,templar,I tried this game a number of times as I am a big fan of management type games. I found this one a bit difficult to work with mostly the biggest problem I have with it is the contract system I think because it is using the euro for its currency I think it would be much better if you could choose other currencies such as the us dollar they do have tutorials that does explain a good portion of the game. Other than the currency being in the euro I had a bit of difficulty  finding and contacting free agents that could have been better handled such as having the option under the league that you are in or under national instead of under world also would have been better off if they had a section for free agents and then a section for scouts to contact the college students instead they are all thrown in together including players that are already signed to other teams or other leagues so it makes it difficult to  find free agents and to assign scouts to college players.It would also be better if they had an option to assign scouts to monitor specific areas and go ont here own to scout players  instead of just having to assign scouts to to players also having a place to go to view the top 25 college prospects as well as each scouts top 25 prospects would be nice.maybe a whole section for scouting. Also seems to load and save very slowly even when you don't select more then one organization it still is very long  load and save times for a game that is not very graphical it boggles the mind at the slowness of it.

To add to this, the interface is too basic. Football manager games which had been this amateurishly designed who never have sold a copy. Who designed this? A GCSE School Kid? Because it can't have been developed by a professional game developer... actually, let me rephrase that; It can't have been developed by a competent professional game developer."

BUT it would not be fun, it takes forever to do anything. The interface is painfully bad. And yeah, this game was cheap but to be honest it's not even worth a dollar. Oh, and yes I haven't even put an hour into the game but just getting to the first game was a painful experience. This game is just painfully bad. Like not even entertainingly bad."
