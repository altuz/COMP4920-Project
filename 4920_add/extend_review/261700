When a game has achievements for dying in various ways you should expect it to happen often. Almost anything and everything will try to kill you at some point and deaths are everywhere including in your house you start in, at the stage selection screen, after touching the ending flag and more. Many of the levels requires you to think outside the box and the obvious solutions are just there to kill you. On the plus side you have unlimited re-tries (unless you play the fiendish EX-mode), the protagonist is cute and checkpoints are not as rare as you would fear. Only thing that could be annoying is that the music restarts each time you re-spawn. Still easier than Flappy Bird."

The game got some laughs out of me because of all its surprises. Grass impales me with spikes, pans fly out of nowhere, venus flytraps sprout from thin air. It was wonderful at first but I wanted to get past the first section of the level without dying for the 50th time; it literally says ""-49"" lives for me right now. The game trolls you by baiting you into traps you'd never expect, plummeting you against odds that are impossible to get through without dying. Lucky for me, I got it for a few cents so not a huge loss. Maybe I'll try to get through it when I'm bored because I want the poor girl to live but I feel like I'd never see it to the end. Plus, constantly sending a little girl to her death under the guise of a rogue game isn't really something I can find much enjoyment in. Don't pay for it full price, especially if you're expecting to finish. You are 99.99% likely to look for a Guide or Walkthrough before that happens.2/10"

,Recommended,261700,8423219,"Posted: 30 December, 2013",all,QP,"Before you play Eryi's Action, you should go buy a melon. Preferably a honeydew, but I would suggest picking your favorite melon, whether that be cantaloupe, watermelon, or even the rare and delectable canary melon. No matter how tempted you are to eat the melon immediately upon getting it home, fight the urge, and play Eryi's Action instead.I am a sucker for games where you get to play as a cute, yet innocently brainless, heroine on a quest to accomplish something that seems utterly pointless. In this case, Eryi's treasured melon has been stolen by a rival fairy-troll named Farta. Not being the type to forgive such transgressions, or to get another likely easily-obtainable melon, our diminutive champion embarks on a trial-filled crusade against all odds to retrieve her hallowed memento. She gets as far as the front door, where a metal washing pan falls from the ceiling, crushes her skull, and kills her.Oh, dear.No worries! Through green-haired plant fairy magic (I guess), Eryi is able to regrow herself. Wise now, she evades the falling pan that led to her premature demise, and makes it to the first stage...only to be stripped by clothes-eating plants, mauled by something in a bear costume, knocked off the edge of the world by a chicken, abducted by a hot-springs loving alien frog, blown up by a bomb, and had her tender bottom pierced by spike traps. Eryi is determined though, and after honing her skills and memorizing the path through the minefield of traps, she finally makes it to the flag at the end of the level. And then she's bonked in the head by a falling spike-boulder on her way out.Such is life in Eryi's world, ten levels of death-filled 2D platforming and puzzle solving that will test both your mental prowess and the quickness of your reflexes. There is a fantastic mix of each in the game. Once you finally figure out exactly where to put that mushroom to bounce over that huge wall, you're immediately mashing buttons in a panic trying to avoid the monsters on the other side. Just when you think you've got it figured out, the game throws you a curve ball, where you suddenly have an intense boss fight with a dragon or a race with a flying robot. It is great pacing, where I never got bored of doing one task, and it always seemed like something new was right around the corner.Well, it seemed that way. Most of the time, it was death that was right around the corner. But even that was something new: it was hilarious to see exactly how many ways Eryi could kick the bucket. I found myself hesitating while standing on each teleporting pot. I knew it was a trap. I knew it would lead to my death. But I still found myself hitting that down arrow instead of running toward that save flag, just to see what Farta's dastardly trap was that time.That's part of the appealing magic this game has. Eventually, you are seeing traps everywhere, and you think you are wise to the tricks and ploys, only to find the game expects you to be wise to its tricks and ploys, so it kicks it up one more notch. A perfect example of this came about halfway through the game, where I saw a jump to a platform that was obviously a trap. I inched toward the edge, making sure no frog would suddenly jump out of the background, and jumped. Straight up, of course, never ever jump at an angle first. AHA! My head bonked against an invisible box, one that would have certainly led to my death if I had not been so astute. Hopping atop that box, and knowing there was still plenty of room on the screen for another hidden box, I leapt again. And sure enough, there was another hidden box revealed. I was sure I saw the trap then: I was expected to take a leap of faith right over the platform ahead, from atop the uppermost box. I chuckled. I wasn't even going to lose a life on this part. And then a spikeball fell on me when I jumped on the top box. I was laughing so hard that I died six more times before I was able to get to the platform, which didn't have a single trap on it. ...well, if you don't count the sudden plant out of nowhere that almost killed me a few seconds later.A lot of people seem to misunderstand this type of game concept, thinking it is some kind of test to find a holy player of legend who is so skilled that they will make it through the game on the first try without losing a single life, and then becoming very upset when that legendary player isn't them, and they watch their death toll rise to triple-digits on the first stage alone. This game isn't a test like that at all. Instead, it is a test of perseverance and the ability to learn. Then, after a few playthroughs and a couple thousand deaths, you can amaze your friends as they watch you play it, and you fool them into thinking you're that legendary player.The final boss is also amazingly difficult. I really felt like I had accomplished something when she finally went down. I had that “YES, I did it,” moment that, as gamers, we all chase.Some of the funniest moments I had in the game were when my steam friends instant messaged me or started playing games of their own, and that little steam window popped up in the lower right corner to alert me. Except, in this game, because of the resolution, it isn't so little...it is huge. So huge it often covers up what's going on and leads to your death. As if the game couldn't troll me enough, it had to call in steam to do it too. I was able to laugh it off, and laugh it off quite heartily, but if you have lots of friends and are annoyed by such things, make sure you turn your steam alerts off before playing.I did play with a controller. I would highly suggest one for this game, as playing with a keyboard seemed clunky and awkward to me. The movement was liquid smooth with the controller though.I paid $2.49 for it, during the holiday sale, and I feel reasonably compensated. It is a bit short, but it also isn't a game you can sink your teeth into. It is just a charming little three hour distraction. For me, there is little replay value. I could collect hard-to-reach crystals, and I probably will, to unlock a hard mode, which I probably won't play. The final boss really pushed me to my limits, I couldn't even imagine what a hard mode of that would be like with only 30 lives. Still, a real hardcore gamer might find a true challenge there, and might enjoy those pursuits. It'd certainly make a good youtube video.By the end of the game, I was wondering which Eryi would be the one lucky enough to survive. For me, it was Eryi Number 646 that finally defeated Farta and avenged her 645 fallen comrades.When you reach that point, when you have your surviving Eryi, the forces of evil are defeated, and the quest completed, go and get your melon. Cut yourself off a big slice of it, and dig in. It'll be the best melon you've ever tasted."

Very difficult but rewarding (EX Mode is the hardest)2. Very colorful3. This game to me is a combination of I Wanna Be The Guy & Cat Mario4. You get achievements for dying a certain way (Some of the deaths were funny)5. Good Art6. The game has 11 stages but the amount of traps the game throws at you makes you play the game for hours since it involves a lot of puzzle solving7. Good MusicCons:1. The Last Boss Battle in my opinion is too easy (Everything else in the game was hard except for that last boss battle but playing the last Boss Battle on EX Mode is ♥♥♥♥ing hard)2. The Whole Point Of This Game Is To Regain Your Melon From An Evil Fairy Named Farta......... That's not a prize to be proud of3. There is no Return To Map Button In The Pause Menu4. The Endings on Both Normal Mode & EX Mode In My Opinion SuckOverall This game is pretty fun to play even though it kicks your butt a lot & I'm not sure if the fruit is worth it...

I don't like these types of games because there is literally NO skill involved.  All you need to know is what to expect next from the tricks and traps, and you will get through.  I only played through Level 1, and I found the game not interesting enough to continue.  KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN BUYING THIS GAME.  KNOW THAT THIS GAME IS MEANT TO TROLL YOU (ex.

Be aware, that you will not be able to beat the game within one playhthrough; be prepared to die even more often than you would in Dark Souls. This game is much more polished than Syobon Action and less difficult and unfair, I think; it doesn't feel unfair at all, if you know, what's expecting you in this game.For now I made it to the next-to-last level, and 'til now all the levels were absolutely beatable. For me, it was never frustrating to die even 20 times in a row because of one single enemy, and I'm at about -300 lives yet. The graphics are simple, cute and lovely, although the game just supports a low resolution; but for me, it's fine.The achievements also are not too difficult to get, and they motivate you to play the game again, even after you've finished the story.So, if you like tricky Jump'n Runs, if you like retrying levels often, and if you have no problem with dying about 50 times per level, this game is just for you. Do not buy this if you want a Sonic-like Jump'n Run where you can rush through the levels like  you have to get to the toilet immediately; but if you like, what you're reading, just give it a shot.And it seems like I'm the only one, who's okay with the controls."

Despite the name, the challenge actually comes from using your brain to circumvent most of the traps, instead of intense platform gaming skill.  There's more memorization and crafty dodging than there is frame-perfect timing and exact jumps, though there is still a need for intermediate platforming acuity.Part of the draw for me was the creativity in the logic-less land of kawaii death.  Many surprise hits actually just made me laugh on the inside thinking ""are you serious?  THAT just happened?""  Instead of just surprise spikes slapped onto every other pixel of land, sometimes enemies popped out that block you just hit, sometimes the entire level shifted to send you into an abyss, sometimes you had to outrun things that you didn't initially even know was a threat!  But then, bit by bit, you ignore that block, jump just a little later, and speed just that much faster past these points, making real progress without it feeling like too much of an unfair slog.Pretty tight controls, a sufficiently cutesy art style, and fun level design combine for an entertaining gauntlet of hundreds of lost lives.

This time you made it half a screen farther, but then died because you stepped on the one part of the platform that a monster jumps out of. Go back to the checkpoint. Trial and error nonsense.Also, for a game that expects you to die over and over the music is poorly chosen. several early tracks have a buildup at the beginning, which you will hear each time you restart.

You can't even leave your house or select a level without having to avoid something completely random and unexepected jumping out and killing you. It is a platformer that trolls you with platforms that you fall through as you land on them and gaps that suddenly widen as you try and jump across them. While the levels look straightforward, they are extremely difficult as you end up having to come up with some crazy sceme to get through it without dieing. You never know what to expect and always manages to find some new way to kill you constantly keeping you on the edge of your seat."

There's fans of this type of game and unless you're the kind that enjoys endless mindless memorization combined with trial and error and very very loose controls then avoid. There is a noticable and most likely deliberate lag in the controls regardless of what method you choose. So sloppy controls combined with pixel perfect gameplay and non-sensical rule on what is and is not safe makes for a rather bland dull game. Oh, and the music, you'll end up turning it off immediately. It loops and repeats forever over every death and never changes. And to add to all this, the deaths take forever to respawn. First you die, then you bounce, then other things bounce, then you have to wait for all that to fall off the screen AND the musical WAHWAAAAAAAH to finish, and god help you if you trigger another trap at the same time."

Everything, from you to the enemies you get constantly murdered by (which will happen on average every 1.5 seconds) is a kawaii-uguu, rainbow-puking, flower-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ taking part in the extremely sadistic Moeshit Apocalypse of You Dying A Lot Except Also Kawaii or Something.On multiple occasions you will get completely brickwalled by seemingly impassable hazards and roadblocks that you have to work around, often inventively and in unexpectedly hilarious ways. Every time you start up the game you begin in Eryi's house and have to evade being bonked to death by falling pans that will virtually always outsmart your movements and send your negative lives remaining count that much closer to infinity. You can even get killed while on the world map, because even the background props have murderous intent: there is pretty much nothing in this game that can't or won't deliberately kill you in some bizarre way.So on the one hand there's you screeching and raging at the absurd difficulty of this game as a more or less perfectly programmed torture simulator, but on the other hand the outright unpredictable ways in which the game communicates to you just how much it hates you are literally nothing short of hilarious. This is a game about dying literally thousands and thousands of times, and you're more likely to get into a plane crash and be abducted by aliens at the exact same time than you are to clear this game without dying even once. You can't pull off a perfect no-miss run in this game because you were never meant to: nobody was. Otherwise you wouldn't have infinite lives and a counter that's always more than willing to rub in your face the number of times you've died. The object of the game is not preventing your death count from continuously rising, but solving platform puzzles which can be bypassed only via methods comparable to the unintentional exploits that let you fling yourself outside of the world map in the N64 version of Zelda OoT, except this time they're both deliberate and lying in wait to be discovered to hilarious effect.I don't think this is a kind of game you can just rate out of 10, so I won't.

I was wrong.It turned out to be something of those crazy hacked Mario type of games, but was more polished. Everything in the game looks and feels nice, until you strated your journey and learned that it wouldn't be a smooth ride. The game tried to counter the behaviors imprinted into gamers for decades, it targeted our trained reations and tuanted at us like those a-holes in school (but smaters)Playing this game, I felt frustrations, but in a good way... because instead of doing things I've been doing for all these years before finishing the game and move on to another one, I got to think hard about how to proceed each of my steps because I know the game would always throw some nasty things on my plate along the way."

I find the game boring and a test of my patience more then my skill. Which I do not like in my games. I have better things to do and I know that you do too even without meeting you because I know that you value your time (except for the 2 or 3 people that have nothing better to do then waste their time. To those people I say. Go ahead and waste your time. I hope you have a long and fullfilling life). That's how unsatifying playing this game is. Don't waste your money. You aren't missing anything. This game is bad game design at it's worst. This type of difficulty is only designed to falsely extend the length of the game just like a lot of the classics. But this game is nothing like the classics I grew up with. It lacks any kind of creativity or nuance to the way it traps you into unavoidable deaths. Play Bloodborne instead. You can even tell people you beat/platinumed it without feeling enbarrassed. It's more challenging and it is based on your skill playing the game not trial and error. If you are observant you will see the traps (a switch on the floor with a hole in the wall. I wonder what that does?) before you die to them because it is not cheap and unavoidable. It's trying to test your skill not your patience and how much free time you have to keep dying to cheap  deaths only to get nothing for it. You learn absolutly nothing from your deaths in Eryi's Action and a lot of the time you won't even know why you died.This game is disgusting. It has a little girl that is probably no older then 6 that, if you stand still, will jump up and down so her panties will show. WTF? I didn't realize this at first but was greeted to this animation after a bathroom break. If you have too much money and time to waste or external validation for beating a game like this then it might just be the game for you. Just don't expect any actual reward for beating it. The game has no ingame rewards. The exact opposite of other 'challenging' games. No rewards for playing or any hints to pay attention to too avoid death. So yes no skill needed either. Just see the death once then avoid it next time. This game tests your patience, nothing more. The ""difficulty"" comes from cheap deaths. This game would be equally fun and a lot more rewarding/worthwhile to play if they added hints of where traps are. That way observant players could avoid them and feel rewarded. Instead of having the entire game based around trial, error, and the amount of patience I have.Nope. Nope. Nope. Not recommended. There are 0 reasons to play this game. There are no positives. It is just not a rewarding game to play. Since there are no indications of where traps are placed there is no skill involved in beating a level. It instead is about patience. No reflex or observation skills needed like the games it is trying to emulate (Mario). There is no sense of reward after beating a level as a result of this. Only a mixed feeling of elation and regret. Regret at the time you wasted and elation at the fact that you will never have play the previous level again. For this I can not recommend it. Even if you beat this game because you want to prove how good you are at poorly made, frustrating games, who will care? There isn't a single reason to play this game. Beyond making easy rage videos on Youtube with it. The only people that will enjoy this game are people that are trying to prove they are ""Otaku"" (but are they really enjoying it if they are just trying to prove something?) by showing they have too much money and time to have the sense to know what to do with either of them by beating this game. If you find a valid reason to play this game let me know because I have no idea why anyone would play it. Let alone truly enjoy beyond the easy rage views they will get from Youtube videos.You will frequently die because the hit detection isn't accurate. You will die to things that didn't actually hit you. You will also die when jumping on killable enemies only to be killed by them because of spotty hit detection. In a game where you jump on enemies to kill them this is inexcusable. The pickup and jump buttons don't even work half the time either. The game even crashes when you exit. It's a mess. If you just want a difficult game to play there are better examples on steam and some even have multiplayer so you might even make a friend while enduring the trials the game presents. Not so with Eryi's Action."

Not too easy, not too hard, and a good mixture of puzzles and humor.Full Review:Eryi's Action is great die-hardish platformer. Even though it may classify as an unfair platformer, I never once felt cheated or angry about dying. Plus, the death animations can be pretty funny and creative. This game is an almost perfect mix between hardcore platforming but fun and engaging gameplay. Hard, yes; but short and sweet. My first playthrough lasted about 2 hours, but there are a few more achievements and collectables (the gems) within the game that I went back for.As you progress through the game, you learn that certain items can be used and manipulated in more than one way. Sometimes there is more than one way to beat a level or overcome an obstacle.

This would feel sloppy if it were on Newgrounds! The animation is choppy, the controls are slippery and the fact that they are asking for five bucks for this is just insane. This game offers very little new to the sea of platformers, with the only thing worth mentioning is its absurd, mind numbing, keyboard breaking difficulty. Let me provide an example: I tried to leap onto a platformer to get a diamond and a wall suddenly appeared in front of me and blocked my path, which resulted in spikes appearing above me and killed me. Or how about this example: I tried walking out of my house and a sea of pie pans fell from the sky and killed me. Or this: The game told me to jump into a vase to teleport somewhere and I was teleported into a spike filled pit and died on the spot! You know how people are always saying that games like Five Nights at Freddy's are only bait for people that makes walkthrough of them getting scared? Well this game is bait for people who make walkthroughs of them rage quiting! There is no logic, reason, strategy, thought, or effort but into the difficulty. Its noting more then a trial and error simulator where you have to memorize where all the traps are. I died over 40 before I was half way through the first level. 80% were not my fault because a bed of spikes or killer plants suddenly appeared beneath me or a the ground fell out from under me, or the game straight up LEADING ME INTO A DEATH TRAP. None of this is the slightest bit fun and is only VERY annoying for lack of better (and four lettered) words. This game was an absolute waste of money and utterly unenjoyable.

It's also extremely fun the whole way through, unlike IWBTG.Controls: Simple and responsive. May take a bit of getting used to, as Eryi isn't the swiftest of platforming ladies. I highly recommend playing with a controller over keyboard. The grabbing timing is something that also takes a lot of getting used to.Control Score: 8.5/10Sound: Very well-done. I've found myself humming along with the music several times. The sound effects are good and sound like what they're conveying. I really do enjoy the soundtrack quite a bit and will likely buy it soon.Sound Score: 8/10Graphics: Super-cute and perfectly fit the game. Everything that should stick out, sticks out. Everything is very well-conveyed, too. It reminds me of the NIS RPGs in terms of tone in that regard.Graphics Score: 8.5/10Gameplay: Hardcore platforming action. It does rely quite a bit on memorization from what I've seen, but not so much that it becomes unfun. You can circumvent several deaths with good enough reflexes and forethought. Some deaths are almost completely unavoidable the first time, though. That said, it's still fun, even after dying ten times from the same enemy/trap.Gameplay Score: 7.5/10Fun Factor: It's a cutesy 2D platformer starring an adorable main character in which you are likely to die about as much as the average roguelike. You can pick up enemies and use them to help you solve platforming puzzles and the like. As someone that loves puzzle platformers, this is wonderful. If you're someone that is easily frustrated, then ""Eryi's Action"" likely isn't for you. You're going to die and it's going to happen a lot. And that's just fine.Fun Factor Score: 9/10Final Thoughts: This type of game is like the first time you try BDSM. Popular culture portrays it as super-rough, all the time, and unfair. In truth, it's rough, but always manageable, and always safe. When practiced right. ""Eryi's Action"" is one such correct practice.Final Score: 8.5/10t;'dr Cute chibi Druid has an adventure, deadly shenanigans ensue. 8.5/10"

This game is a pretty, stylistic, precision-controlled, fiendishly difficult platformer. At first glance it looks and plays like an anime Mario Bros, but a few minutes' gameplay will dispel that idea. Eryi's Action throws a variety of clever and/or cheap traps at you, For instance, in many places, the ground will just drop out from underneth you, sending you to your death. In other places an enemy might drop out randomly from the sky at an inoppotune time, or spikes might shoot up out of a pit while you're jumping across. Anything easy is likely to be a trap, and, after a while, you'll start anticipating some of the traps.There's a true beauty to the gameplay here, Eryi's Action establishes early on that the game is not fair, nor does it intend to be. If you can tolerate and embrace this mindset, and if you don't mind dying literally hundreds of times, then you'll enjoy the game. Eryi's Action is beautifully made, the platforming is precise, the graphics are lovely, and the game features not just platforming, but some flying/shooting sections, swimming, a clever RPG-style boss fight, and some very clever physics puzzles. All of it is brutally difficult, it's a match of wits between the programmer and yourself, a battle against unfair odds. It's a true gem, if only for the most hardcore of gamers."

This game, although seemingly easy, is most certainly not. You look at this gap and think 'oh i can do this no problem' and you go to jump and there is a hidden block you hit and you fall into the pit.. yeah.. its great lol for the few levels that they have, i died about 750 times.. just to beat the game! Yeah.. its that difficult.. although i did enjoy it and i totally recommend it to those who enjoy a seemingly easy platformer."

Think outside the box and you'll be done and dusted as quickly as you can help it.Recommended for anyone with even a little shred of patience or those who loved Syobon Action."

The characters, sound and the overall environment is absolutely adorable while the game is rather difficult. It's the type of game that trolls you with every step. You will walk, die then go back and knowing how you died, find a solution to the problem... only to realize they thought of your solution and that is in itself another death. It really is a puzzle game that uses your death as a method of problem solving, looking for creative ways to find a solution. I may only be 30 minutes in currently but I already adore this game. Just go in prepared that it's going to be an absolute cheap troll to you and treat it more as a puzzle game then a platformer. Well worth the $2.50 I paid for it on Steam sale (normally $5). Be warned the controls are a little odd as they use arrows and Z, X, C which from what I hear is more of a Japanese standard but I believe controllers will work."

,Recommended,261700,21742921,"Posted: 9 March, 2016",all,Cyril,"This is a dumb joke game that should be treated as a dumb joke game. It's basically I Wanna Be The Guy or Syobon Action except not really focusing on any actual platforming, just killing you with traps for the lolz. And as a joke game? Generally fine. The weakest moments are when it tries to be an actual game, with a few tricky platforming bits and the first and last boss are just very straightforward and out of place. The distance between checkpoints is always short so it just becomes a matter of learning each section until you can clear it then moving on to the next, and there's no real lives system so no game overs and no frustration. There were a few moments of weirdly glitchy stuff apparently being the intended solution, which I don't really like, but beyond that the traps and puzzles are decently clever. Not the best game ever or anything, and certainly not worth any more than the $5 it sells for, but if you want some laughs at your own expense then sure, go for it."

,Recommended,261700,20462215,"Posted: 10 January, 2016",all,Sylnt Crane,"I am kind of both recommending Eryi’s Action and not recommending this game at the same time. However, I am giving this a recommendation because I had a good time playing this game. If you enjoyed other comedically evil games such as Syobon Action or I Wanna be the Guy, you will definitely enjoy this game. On the other hand, if you can’t stand those types of games, you will probably not like this game.In my opinion, the most appealing part of Eryi’s Action is the numerous ways Eryi gets defeated in this game. The defeats are accompanied by a cartoonish sprite of Eryi being defeated corresponding to Eryi’s unique method being defeated all-the-while giving a hilarious reaction to being defeated on her face. Other than the graphics, the game does not have too many things different from the standard comedically evil game. The puzzles are fun to figure out and some of the traps the game pulls on you are very funny and clever.If you are the type of person who is looking for a real platformer, you will definitely not find it here. The controls function just fine for what it is, in my opinion. The level design will actively tell you that any knowledge of platforming you have will get you defeated. Despite what everyone says, this game is not difficult at all. Like Syobon Action, if you know all the traps, you will not die as much since this game does not take that much skill to complete.Overall, I really like this game since I came in expecting hilarious and evil game. If that is not your taste, then you will probably not like it at all. However, if it is, it is an experience that is definitely worth the money you payed for it."

That does not mean the game is difficult by any means, but it is designed in a way that is more so meant to make you think of how you can overcome the next obstacle instead of trying to wear you down and slowly drain away any will you have to continue. Yes Eryi's Action is by no means an easy game but it is a fun one regardless that has nice variety and creativity in terms of its level design, and is a game that never stopped being fun despite the large amount of deaths.

Hidden traps lurk around even corner, just when you least expect it, and the traps must be manipulated in the right order or in the right position to progress.  The game is much less difficult than it seems, because after the initial ""gotcha!"" of an unknown trap it becomes simple to bait out and avoid, and the real challenge is often the puzzle of finding out how to grab the goalpost at the end of the level (it's harder than it sounds!).  Levels are fairly short once trap locations are memorized, and despite the frequent deaths and frustration the game can be completed in just a few hours.  The colorful cartoony art style helps the medicine go down smoother, too."
,Recommended,261700,32354271,Posted: 11 June,all,Cuddly Kitty,"If this game wasn't upfront about its nature, I'd call it terrible.  Eryi's Action is a platformer game that draws heavy influence from Kaizo Mario stages.  Now, it's nowhere near as nasty as those stages can be, but you will still find yourself dying over and over and over again.Overall, this game was quite enjoyable, though it was on the short side with only 12 stages.  For comparison, I ended up logging on around 4-5 game hours or so to beat this.  It's not as hard as Super Meat Boy or Escape Goat's All Intensive Purposes mode, both of which I've beaten.The main gripe I would have is the lack of controller mapping, although it's very possible to map them yourself via Big Picture (I stongly recommend 4-direction instead of 8-direction movement setting for all but the final stage, BTW).  If you still want to use a controller, you will find Queendom's Keyboard Controls guide to be very helpful. I was also able to export my own mapping, but bear in mind that it was meant for a wired 360 controller. :3Queedom's Keyboard Table:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=504993301"
