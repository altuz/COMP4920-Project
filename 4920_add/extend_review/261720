Still had fun, for what it's worth. Cheap voice actors probably would have helped immensely.Only bother if you desperately want a shallow, simple RPG to kill a few hours (and even then I'm sure there are many other, better options out there.)"
,Recommended,261720,12605582,"Posted: 23 October, 2014",all,strifekun,"I was actually pretty surprised at this game. I thought I would be immediately put off around five minutes into playtime, but I found myself quite surprised by it. While this certainly isn't the best game out there, it's got it's own unique charm - that I believe - should be given a chance.I found the characters to be refreshing. They aren't super complex or deep, the opposite really, but I think it plays to it's strength. The main character is self-centered, misogynistic, and completely oblivious to it. The 'love' interest is flighty and hangs on the main characters every word, despite having to do his bidding - even at her own expense.There are a ton of pop culture references in the game if you are familiar with them. (Things like that always tickle my fancy.) And the dialogue, while pretty limited, is pretty endearing. The graphics aren't anything to write home about, but I've found that because the environment is bright, made it pleasing for me to play.Now this doesn't mean that there weren't a few things that didn't bug me. There were. Like how the camera liked to fly away when I moved my mouse. Or how certain dialogue no longer appeared in a box - which made it hard to follow. Then there was one point where there was a battle with scripted dialogue, but I moved and killed something before the scripted actions finished - effectively leaving me stuck and making me reload. Text will automatically scroll fast in the beginning until you change the speed. But none of this was actually enough to stop me from finishing.So to be super honest, this game - while enjoyable - is definitely what I call a 'one and done'. So once you finish, you probably won't play it again. So I advise to not buy it at full price; wait until a sale."

The tile-based, turn-based combat is satisfying. The characters are charming and fun, despite and because of their silly dialog. Not a bad way to spend a few dollars."

I loved the first two grotesque tactics games. As soon as I saw this I immediatly bought it. The main problem with the game is, that there is less everything. Basically this game is, what the first ( maybe the first two) chapter in one of the first two games is. Only that the first two games had a bunch of chapters coming after that. It has fewer characters (barely any actually), fewer quests/places to go to, way fewer items and is extremely short in general. This is basially a DLC and not a game. Whats worst though, is that the humor this time falls flat. Where usually there was dark humor and many references to pop culture, now there still is a bit of that left but just a tiny bit and the jokes are basically sexist/blonde jokes, which can be funny and only offensive to really sensible people if you do it right, but they didnt do it right. The jokes are performed so clumsily that its hard to give anyone more than a grin at best. Now if this was only 2 dollars I'd say go ahead and take it if you are a fan of the series, since the few characters that you use are still the ones you know and love and a tiny bit of story unfolds itself which might interest you, but for the price it is at right now I can only say stay away, its not worth it.P.S: If you havent played the other games yet this game is just confusing and totally not worth your money on any sale."

It is still fun but because it is shorter I would keep that in mind when considering a purchase. Unlike Grotesque Tactics 1-2 where you had a party of 6-10 characters, in this game you max out at 3 and none of them are new if you played GT 1-2. Also know that at least at the time of release/this review, there was no English audio, only German; I know they are hoping to add English though at some point and it is listed in the options menu, but tells you that it is not currently available. Of course there is English text, and there were some humorous parts; as long as you don't expect it to be as in-depth as GT 1-2 and think of it more as a short adventure episode/epilogue then I don't think you will be disappointed."

As the mightiest of heroes, you embark upon a much deserved vacation to a remote island with a small entourage of personal maidens. Things quickly escalate from there, however, and you soon find yourself amidst another hair-brained adventure.For anyone unfamiliar with the series - Grotesque Tactics is a parody RPG franchise that hails from Germany, with two previous entries. Similar to these past games, HAvsMotD combines isometric camera angles with a colorful 3D world full of whit and humor. The actual RPG aspects are surprisingly solid, though nothing especially complex of course. Hotbars, Combat Abilities, Skill Trees - all the usual suspects are present; plus, plenty of shiny loots to loot and sexy maidens to rescue! For combat, the old 'turn-based grid movement' formula is in effect.All in all, well worth it's price and then some!"

Completed in 6 hours with all achievements. The humor was ok, but I laughed a lot more with GT1 and GT2. Overall I can't say I was disappointed, but this third episode was  a ""lite"" version of the previous ones. I suggest to buy it on sale, 10Eur is too much for what will you get. 3/5"

These were relieved by in-game dialogue, though I do have to agree with Holy Avatar and the entire party on one character. Holy Avatar vs. Maidens of the Dead (or Grotesque Tactics 2.5, in my opinion) is great if you like games that break the fourth wall, and enjoy seeing references to popular culture. While it is much shorter than Evil Heroes or Dungeons & Donuts, it ties up a few loose ends all the way back to Evil Heroes, while leaving some plot holes gaping open. At least Holy doesn't forget people when he gets Hero's Amnesia. Sweet Violence tied the whole thing together. I kind of miss Ed, but he does have a major mobility problem."

I've chuckled a couple times already and already seen jokes referencing Ultima and Zelda and the RPG male fantasy.  It's already worth the pittance I paid for it.  The combat is turn-based, it's not XCOM complicity, more traditional rpg style (with jokes, level-up after one monster?).  The initial monsters are kinda funny and well animated (the art style is pretty good so far).  I'm currently fighting care bears (by another name) that snuggle you to death and monkeys throwing coconuts from trees and ko'ing me (just had to load)."

Sadly Drake is not in this one, so no contrast as Holy is the only ""main character"" in here.But most of all it isn't working very well. No map other than the minimap, so i constantly forgot in which direction i had to run (through 2 other zones) to get to the zone i needed to be for some quest. No indication if you have completed a quest objective and should run back to the quest giver, if you remember who that was.And i couldn't find a quest item i needed to get any further, as i already killed the ones who were supposed to drop it on one of my ""where am i supposed to go now""-walks.

It's kinda cool that they are parodying the seriousness of fantasy rpgs (again) but it's far more silly than witty. It's also quite hard to make out many of the background conversations as the text boxes are tiny and disappear very quickly. Voice acting would have helped.The fighting at the beginning is very tedious (before you get more advanced skills). And then when you get the better skills the game is over very soon after so don't get to use them much. I finished the game with characters only on lvl9/10 so hadn't upgraded much.I think the previous Grotesque tactics games are better so if you are on the fence about this one, get the bundle.I'd give this a 5/10. It's not terrible. There are a lot worse games out there, but also a lot better. Something like Blackguards fo example if you want to stick to this genre."

You know, the arrogant hero (looking a bit the Duke, called a bit the Avatar), the omnipresent female bikini armor, the pointlesssly drawn out fights, the stupid skill trees, and because it's all the rage, it's zombies that are attacking!And all that is packaged in satire. Bt it's not packaged particularly well. The humor overemphasizes sexist tropes (referencing Builder Bob can't save that overall impression), and the gameplay is so bad it is simply bad (the necesssary omni-backstabbing is a drag). Okay, the audio isn't too shabby ifSie verstehen Deutsch, but the game's length, now there's a killer joke. I'm not sure I could even have made 4 hours if I hadn't simul-surfed in another window...Bottom line, this thing is not worth it at regular price.
