From the very first moments you run this game you can see it's high production value. In this horizontal shoot-em up, you control a spacecraft equipped with several offensive and defencive upgradeable systems,  fighting your way through various well designed levels. The controls are responsive and sharp with no momentum (thank god!), the graphics are detailed and colourful and the sound effects are also very good. The difficulty can be adjusted in the beginning of the game to suit the skill of each player. Highly recommended shmup and a must-have, especially for the fans of the genre."

Has varying difficulty levels, allowing you to play regardless if you are familiar with the genre or not. The ability to unleash a turret adds depth and uniqueness that allows the game to not just be another blah game. Also can be funny at times."

I've read some bad review comment about this game which is COMPLICATED?? CONFUSING?? , i dont see anything so confusing or complicated. If you want simple NO BRAIN or PLAIN Shump with only shoot to kill using 1-2 button with just pick up upgrades in space, then this game is not for you. Just play a simple game like Raiden etc. For me that kind of simple game is just waste of money which you can complete in short time.PROS- Multiple upgrade systems- Ability to shoot using difference way and weapon combination- Some mission require some weapon skill (just like Megaman X)- Close to reality (the ammo or energy is not infinity)- Not a plain boring simple Shmup with simple pick up upgrades or just shoot to kill.- Great graphic, music and gameplayCONS- no SPEED/BOOST upgrade found yet since the ship move quite slow(basically the upgrades is not better than Jets n Guns)- quite slow Shmup- Not easy to earn money for upgradesRECOMMENDED FOR ADVANCED PLAYERS."

A game forcing me to look out for hidden stuff to unlock new levels. A game that kills me ten times in a row on easiest mode before even getting halfway through the game.There might be people having fun with this, but I'm disappointed. Why does it need to be so complicated? I just want to shoot some things at the end of a long day."

Not to mention the third and fourth levels just kind of ended abruptly, I thought I failed the missions.If you love high adrenaline shoot em ups and have a 360, check out Strania instead. Or Einhander on the PS1. Or even either of the Geometry Wars. Not so much this. It's not bad but it's not good either."

The graphics are pretty, the gameplay fast and smooth, and the music?The soundtrack -is- this game, it's energetic, fastpaced and totally awesome (to my ears)Still? I honestly don't enjoy playing the game, I found the difficulty not at all to my liking....perhaps I've gotten to old to these sidescrolling shoot'em'ups (just past 30!) , I got fed up after playing the first two levels.Though I personally don't enjoy the game all that much (totally downloaded the soundtdrack however), I can definatly recommend it to fans of the genre."

They basically require you to play for several minutes till you get to the hard part, then you have to memorize each sequence coming up as it kills you and replay the whole thing to get past that point to the next part that kills you.  Extremely annoying."
,Recommended,261740,8762810,"Posted: 18 January, 2014",all,DiglyD,"This is one of the best games I have played in recent years and is now one of my favorite games in my Steam library and I have over 500 games. This is a true side scrolling shoot em up similar to R-Type that harkens to the glorious golden age of NES and SNES shooters. The game has a  great soundtrack and really good graphics. This game punishes you and requires the same old school mechanics that made some of the classic games so memorable. I prefer this game to Sine Mora and Syder Arcade which I just found boring. This game requires almost perfect positioning as well as patient timing and really works your brain. You have to pay attention and know what you are going to do to survive a level. Getting the golden eggs while you are getting shot from every direction and the level is scrolling gives you seconds to figure out the patten and move accordingly. The leve ldesign is great imho. I was acutally very suprised at the low scores at Metacritic and the 1 lame user review. It just shows how lazy game reviewers have become where if a game requires you to memorize or learn something via trial and error or practice like in the goold old days its not good in their eyes. This is an amazing game. The first time I fired it up I played for 2+ hours straight on ""hard"" and it was amazing. I just kept saying ""this game!!"" everytine I died but kept coming back for more. I haven't felt like this since I was a kid. Really solid side scrolling arcade game that requires you to  learn the mechanics, positioning, and item placement. Replaying the levels is not bad as there are many of them that you have access to via branching paths and each is challenging enough not to get boring even during repetitive playthroughs. Each level also ends relatively quickly as you solve or move past the obstacle never forcing you to reply too much of it from the beginning. You do only get one life and in some areas it starts you from the beginning while others from the middle of the level but it does not take long to get to where you were. You can go back to the galaxy map and store at any time if you can't make progress and try other combinations of weapons and upgrades. I have had no problems going through the first 8 stages with just using the 2 basic guns and an armor upgrade and this is on hard. If you loved old school side scrolling shooters like R-Type and wished that modern devs made a game as equally challening and fun as what we used to have that does not hold your hand this is the game for you. This game is affordable and beautiful to play through. This is one of the best purhcases that I made in 2014 and a welcome addition to my library. I have almost every Shmup and arcade game available on Steam and this is now one of my most favorites. Don't listen to the lazy reviews, give this game a shot. Even if you play it for a few hours its exciting, and really fun as it really makes you pay attention and requires you to improve your skills to succeed."

It is a beautiful, challenging and fun game that reminds me of Gradius III which I love. Good job Sumom Games, I would have given it at least 70/100. Fun stuff and a good price!"
,Not Recommended,261740,10965261,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Brototype,"Honestly, I only got this to compare against JnG and my own thing. To be fair, it's got a few interesting aspects that are recognizably mutated from mechanics in other genre entries.But the ship is so infuriatingly slow at the start that I'm really not inclined to keep playing. Sure, it's just the beginning, and I'm not expecting a fully upgraded Atomic Emu up front. Something on the level of the free starter ship from JnG, maybe, but I suspect this thing might actually handle worse than JnG's space race pirate ship, possibly even the unupgraded cargo ship. I feel like a Predator pilot yelling ""CLIMB YOU PIG"" moments before the engine cuts out and the drone just falls out of the sky.It's not a great feeling."

Looks good enough and the other technical aspects are fine, but the game just doesn't offer anything that isn't already done better elsewhere. The plot seems dull with overtly stereotypical characters and the enemies are unimaginative.It's like Jets 'n Guns, but without all the neat stuff which made JnG so awesome.Pick this up only if you're a die-hard shmup fan who doesn't have anything else to play."

Image playing R-Type with weapon upgrades that can be purchased between levels and you petty much know what you will be getting in the game.  The fun mechanic of this title is you can use an energy weapon to kill regular targets and a physical gun to penetrate shielded enemies, so you will be changing between the two weapon types often.  On top of that you can deploy a drone which shoot energy weapons for a few seconds in a stationary position, so you can be firing in two places at once, but you will be placing the drone in the correct location to kill the non shielded foes.Did I mention you will be playing as a chicken who is gunning against the humans?What could possibly be wrong with that???"
