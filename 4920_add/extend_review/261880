And I'm all out of gum because, seriously, who the ♥♥♥♥ chews bubblegum anymore. Like, I haven't seen bubblegum since, like, the 80s. And even if I still saw bubblegum, I'm a 30-year-old man. I'm not gonna chew bubblegum. That's just... That's just... *sigh*""Some people like their jobs. Some people don't. And some people's jobs get overrun by zombie businessmen that groan things they learned in business school. Okay not a lot of people have had that experience in particular but that's what this game revolves around so just use your imagination.This game is very fun in its own unique way. It straight up pokes fun at people not liking their desk jobs and making it very relatable and silly at the same time. The voice acting sounds like it can use a lot of work but they put that in the game for a reason (watch the trailer and you'll see what I mean). Sure there are some things that could use work but it's still a fun, fast-paced, adventurous game with a lot of potential to become somthing more than it is currently. But don't let that stop you from having a good time.To conclude, I leave you with this:There are boss zombies (yes, there are boss fights) that will show you brain-damaging powerpoints, breathe fire, shoot guns, and even turn into magic floating sandwiches.If that isn't awesome, I don't know what is. You have to try this game yourself."

But the premise is pretty funny.  Gameplay is a very simple isometric beat'em'up.  Oh damn, this soundtrack...  MMfff.  Okay, that's pretty good.  That's making beating corporate zombie♥♥♥♥♥just that much sweeter.  Aw man, you recruit NPC people as you walk around?  That's kinda cool to lead a herd of I guess what you would call your ""buddies"" as you battle through the zombie hordes.2nd level:  Lawl, the writing is a bit hit or miss, but It's pretty funny.  I enjoy how you are rewarded between levels with a small skit of very home-hitting corporate life humor that's a nice touch to drive the player through the gameplay.  I'll admit, the action of rampaging around the office and laying into corporate zombies is pretty fun.  Watching my sprite hop over desks and wreck the office as he moves is fairly satisfying.  But by the second level, the gameplay is already getting a little repetitive.3rd level+:  Listening to the zombies moan corporate buzzwords is also a pretty fun touch.  The enemies are not seeing a whole lot of variation besides adding zombies with slightly more health to the mix each level.  Also, I found a red Swingline Stapler and am using it as a weak projectile weapon.  I also found a corded phone that I'm using as a morning star.Overall impression:  This is a fun little beat'em'up with stat tracking that will please the completionist in me,  plenty of awesome theme humor keeps me giggling as I play, and a pumping chiptune soundtrack complements the frantic arcade action well.  This title was well worth what I paid for it."

The game is basically an isometric pixel twin stick shooter but the point of the game is to be a bit of a mild satire. It certainly doesn’t come close to the laugh out loud writing of South Park SoT but the theme is clever and it’ll put a smile on your face hearing zombie upper management using buzzwords. Regardless, it feels like a game you could easily find for free on a flash game website. If you’ve got a spare dollar or two hanging out in your steam wallet and catch this game on sale then it’s alright, but I still haven’t decided if I regret my purchase or not. A VERY cautious recommendation."

It just needs a bit of fleshing out.There isn't much substance to the game at current; it lacks any big RPG elements that keep you hooked to other games of this genre. It's just running around killing zombies and♥♥♥♥♥♥ as if that isn't commonplace enough. So this game tries to shine in other areas.The humor, at times, can be quite witty. The origin of the zombies is especially funny and the pre-level dialogue definitely gave me a few hearty chuckles.However, the main character (aptly named ""Dude"") is often set up in situations reminiscient of third grade lunchtable comedy. You know, when you have to basically set up the scene with your words and then pantomime everything. (The sandwich level cutscene definitely shows this)It's like saying, ""Imagine I'm in a bulldozer,"" then acting like you crash through the wall of the teacher's lounge to create comedy. It doesn't work. It's a juvenile sense of humor that I hate.This is especially disappointing because the maker of this game obviously has the capacity to make some funny♥♥♥♥♥♥ the delivery is just flat-out bad. The voice acting is, to the trailer's acknowledgement, also bad, which totally killed some of the funnier parts of the cutscenes. There are a few redeeming moments, but those are sparse throughout the 100 minutes it took me to beat the story mode. If you want a really funny, cheap game, you're better off playing Dungeons of Dredmor.The one redeeming factor of this game is its soundtrack, one of the best I've ever heard. This game's music is definitely on par with something like Hotline Miami. If, despite my reccomendation, you still buy the game, get the soundtrack with it.If you're really willing to shell out $5 to fulfill some fetish of yours, just buy the soundtrack available on Bandcamp. It's a better use of your money than playing through this game."

Zombies in the office is not an original idea.at first, the game seemed kind of fun, but it's full of bugs and the controls are horrible. you try to punch or shoot the zombies and somehow, you end up walking into them and they hurt you instead.I played for a bit and I noticed the stats at the end of each level, it says how many zombies you killed, how many people you saved, how many objects in the environment you destroyed.this score is pointless, meaningless and redundant as you get absolutely nothing for it. the game is the same whether you kill all the zombies on the level or just run to the exit.there is no motivation to save all the people or to destroy the environment.the game gets boring and repetitive fast.the only fun part is the boss fights, which are super easy so far.I like chiptunes but the chiptunes in this game feel bland and uninspired, it's like they just said ""hey let's just make up some generic tunes and slap them into the game and sell it with the tagline 'HUGE chiptune soundtrack!'""all in all, the game feels like a crappy version of robotron with a little bit of how to survive mixed in.I have played better games for free on armor games website...I admit, I only made it to level 12 and only fought the first 3 bosses before I quit playing.I would have kept playing but I got a game breaking error and now whenever I try to play I keep getting pop ups saying I have a corrupt installation.the game is now unplayable for me and I wish i could have my money back...which I know is never gonna happen and I am glad all they got from me is $1.24.I don't understand why there is such a multitude of positive reviews for this game, they must be shills.don't buy this game.thank you"
,Not Recommended,261880,9589248,"Posted: 21 March, 2014",all,Maxion,"This game takes about 1-2 hours to beat on normal difficulty, and by then it has already gotten quite repetitive.The voice acting is terrible, assuming you can even hear it, because the cutscenes are a lot lower volume than everything else, with no way to turn the voice volume up.The graphics style seemed appealing at first, but it is easy to get stuck on the corners of things, and some of the enemy projectiles are almost impossible to see over the background.Many of the weapons are almost useless, and the hitboxes of normal enemies seems to be only the circle below their feet.There is also some talk about the devs being scumbags toward past customers, but I don't know enough about that to take it into consideration for this review.In summary, maybe if you find it for a dollar it would be worth it for an hour of shooting zombies, but at any price above that this is an avoid unless they apply some serious fixes."

In general it is very linear with slight variations, resultig in simplicity. Packed with this music, voice recordings of the protagonist's thoughts (same as the cutscenes, ultra funny :D ) and so much love in it, it makes a beautiful game. It's exactly my kind of game, I can't find any negative point. I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn't need much story and wants a simple game for a long or a short time. My favourite parts are the music and the look of the game. Everything is full of love, for example, the frames of pixelated sprites are so detailed, you could see a lot of time was spent during the development."

First off, the main menu looks like something out of a bad flash game, it defaults to windowed mode (and crashes when going to fullscreen), the humor is poorly delivered, the voice acting is... ok but way too quiet compared to all the rest of the sounds, some of the weapons are near impossible to use (main example being the chainsaw), and the story I feel was poorly thought out.The good things I have to say about this game is that the music is really good, and the combat is almost fun but there are so many junk weapons that it quickly becomes a hasstle. I think the combat really would have benefitted if the developers had gone with ""quality over quantity"", making some weapons that are really fun to use instead of a bunch of weapons that don't really feel right. Also, in some areas the environment is too cluttered so it is hard to see the zombies.The boss battles are ok, but range from annoying zombies that take a few more shots to kill to being complete bullet sponges where it really becomes a matter of patience more than anything. ""Endless mode"" is really where I was expecting to get the most enjoyment, but of course it suffers from the same combat problems I mentioned before, plus new zombies spawning in is poorly implemented, droping in suddenly causing you to take damage from no fault of your own.Overall, this is a good game if you just want to waste an hour or two, but I would never waste my money on it. The soundtrack *maybe*, but if you really want the game sell a few things on the Steam Market and wait for it to go on sale."

There are two modes. Story and Endless.1) StoryThere are about 23 levels in this game. It starts out hard, but over time gets easier. Like alot easier. The shotgun is the main reason for this since it does 120 damage (like a 1 to 3 shot kill, and you get it by like level 8), Boss fights are also easy (outside of the first one, the I.T. one, and Zombietron). I thought it was also funny, with great banter (LAPD part was funny af). overall the story was alright.2) Endless ModeKind of boring, very easy. I like how its not kill based, but time based, so more zombies spawn every 30 seconds even if al zombies are not dead.Verdict: While i like this game, I cannot recomend for full price (five bucks for this is redonk), Buy on sale (49 cents).

I was so pumped, then I started playing the game. The only way I can properly describe my reaction is the sound a balloon makes when it deflates slowly, and very definitive pfffft. The reaction quickly changed to what I can assume would be akin to the sound of a constipated moose. I tried very hard to get into the storyline, I came to a point where I gave up and just spam clicked through the cut scenes. This game is insanely easy. Around level 4, you can sit in the middle of the level with only the baseball bat and stapler. The ""zombie"" AI is horrid. They often get stuck behind doors and cabinets. I enjoyed the pixel art style of this game, but the camera angle made me hate the game rather quickly. The constraints on some of the levels left me asking ""I thought I was supposed to destroy everything"" and ""why am I saving other office members?"" This game is not worth $5. I honestly wish I had not wasted my money. I agree with another reviewer, I have indeed played better games for free on armorgames.Pros:-Crude humor-Pixel styled game-Awesome sound trackCons:-Buggy AI-Incompetent AI (including bosses)-You can save other non-infected office members, but after only collecting four, a level can be cleared out by  just walking around the zombies-Ranged weapons break the game (extremely overpowered)-Levels with constraintslike ""Don't break 200 items"" in the level-I cannot change the resolution. I try to change the resolution, and the game crashes.Bottom line, I wish I could like this game. I had a good 15 minutes of enjoyable game play and that was about it.

I would say if you don't have a powerful machine to run a lot of games at a solid 30 and suffer from frame drops (me currently) it is a decent game to pick up.

Funny characters make it seem less repetative though.- Level objectives can be easily skipped by just charging through the place.8/10. A diamond in the rough. I strongly suggest that you get this game."

In terms of gameplay, it reminds me most of the original Postal - you're given a wide variety of make-shift weapons (as well as a few real guns) and the object is to make as much mayhem as possible. The game is on the easy side, and the storyline will only last a competent player about two hours.  There is an unlimited wave mode, so you can spend more time there if you want.

Here you unlock things but you keep them during the game only ammo are difficult to find.But something just striked me... the OST.Made by Bignic it's just well... listen to this:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TshRUMhk7w8&list=RD85K4BI-GsGwhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddQpf8m4ij0&list=RD85K4BI-GsGwWhen you listen that you can blast anything for days !Amazing music for a funny game."

Starting into the game, you'll get a cutscene that is pretty funny, then leads you to the amazing song ""Modern"" while beating up zombies and finding the exit. Although it seems like a really cool idea at first, it starts to get repetitive. The gameplay does have different maps, weapons, and cutscenes, but all it really feels like is the same objective from level one. Sometimes the game adds some challenges into the maps, but in reality they probably only appear once or twice in the game, then never seen again.The bosses are pretty much regular zombies but with added health and projectiles, andpretty easy to defeat. The AI for them too is pretty weird, as they'll get stuck on objects. This happened to me and just kept shooting him while he stood there doing nothing until he died, which soured the moment for me. Plus it's hard to be killed by a boss, which makes it even easier to defeat.(TL;DR) Corporate Lifestyle Simulator is a fun game with decent gameplay, funny humor and a amazing soundtrack. The gameplay is repetitive but the cutscenes and music kinda balance it up.For five bucks for the usual price of this game, I would recommend it.7/10"

,Recommended,261880,12325277,"Posted: 2 October, 2014",all,Shaft,"""Corporate Lifestyle Simulator"" is a parody of corporate lifestyle. And it's obviously not a simulator.You play as the Dude, a cubicle worker drone, who finds himself in the midst of a corporate management uprising. The managers are literally drawing people's blood and eating their faces. Are they zombies, or just extra-douchy today?What ensues is a very simple isometric shoot-em-beat-em-up, with a very funny storyline. Throughout the 27 levels, which include boss fights, the gameplay stays the same: hold left-mouse button to win. And enjoy the humor. In ""CLS"", everything's deliberately done as cheesy as possible, so bear that in mind.Unfortunately, the game's potential is much higher than the actual product. There are no RPG elements whatsoever, no upgrades or bonuses of any kind. You just get new weapons, but you'll probably only end up using the shotgun and the uzi and forget about the rest. That's because by the later levels, the managers start coming at you literally in hordes and anything that doesn't have massive firepower is useless.So, yeah, it's a shame some more effort wasn't put to polish the gameplay, but perhaps that's not as bad as it sounds. ""CLS"" is truly a game to let off some steam if I ever saw one. After a busy day, sometimes you just want to give the brain a rest and do some mindless virtual slaughter. ""CLS"" gives you exactly that in the purest form, undiluted by anything else. Be aware that it's not a very long game. On the highest difficulty, it took me about 3hrs to beat. There's nothing in terms of ""new game +""; only the latest few levels may require a retry or two. Its replayability lies in the fact that you can just select a level, and have a short mayhem session whenever you please.Overall, not bad for the price."

There isn't a ton of depth to the gameplay, but it's still fun for what it is. You run around an office and kill people and destroy stuff, all while listening to an awesome electronic soundtrack. The highlights of this game are that you can destroy anything in the office, including desks, cubicles, chairs, glass, cabinets, etc. It's all very satisfying in a simple way, and the sound effects make it even more satisfying. The combat is simple, and you can pick up some cool weapons as you progress. The music is really excellent. It's sort of NIN-inspired electronic industrial sort of, idunno. Worth buying the game just for the music. I picked up the soundtrack as well. Overall, the game is a fun mindless distraction that is easy to pick up and play, relieve some stress, and pretend to punch your boss through a cubicle wall. If you're a fan of retro-style beat-em-ups, and electronic music, you will probably like this game."

Oh, sorry, not zombies. Just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CLS is a game with a sharp wit, towards both the primary obvious target, and people who think of them that way. The main character is a meme spouting man with interest in a girl he saved, yet he is realistically awkward and flubs his memes enough (Like someone would do in the middle of something) that the humor comes through strong.

Outside of all that, CLS has a very simplistic game play. Shoot, destroy the office, and save co-workers while navigating through the cubic corporate wastelands all the while destroying the ""corporate zombies."" The boss fights are well done 1 on 1 arena type action. Controls are solid, though, I feel a game of this nature deserves 2 sticks. This was my biggest let down. Joy2Key does work, though you lose some control as its not really 360 bound and not as effeciently as mouse&key.Gameplay = Arena ShooterGraphics = straight 8-bit (wish they add a bit of contempary graphic here)Sound = Sound track is great and you should expect Cheese with your voice over!Controls = Good (...at same time disappointing without sticks)Replayable = Definately, it's a fun game.Overall = 8/10If you dug the trailer, you should check this game out."
