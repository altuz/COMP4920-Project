I'm confused myself. All I know is I'm having fun."

Instead of just leaving it at that though, I'll try to put what I feel in words. This game seems like it was developed to be the ulitmate abstract expression of both the 90's ""collect-a-thon"" platformers and the modern open-world ""sandbox"" games.  It's minimalistic aesthetic serves well the feeling of exploration and the occasional bits of story you recieve from journal pieces and conversations are tantalizing enough to entice you to find them all and piece together the entirety of the narrative.While the gameplay so far has never diversed from ""roll around, color, collect, talk"" I don't think it needs to, it's a testament to the philosophy that simplicity is key and sometimes overthought in the game design process isn't required. In addition to the of the world beng a clever mechanic, it also lends a hand to the relaxing nature of the game and imparts a sense of ownership as no two worlds will be the same and you can feel proud of your coloring as you traverse your world.There really isn't much negative to say about the game, but one should be informed the game has no save mechanic. This is by design and I really don't think it needs to have saving, but definitely make sure to make time for this game because all of your work will be lost upon closing. (edit: ive been informed this is no longer the case and the game saves on exit. YAY!)That's really all I have to say about Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love. I don't think this will win over some gamers but I would encourage everyone to at least try it. What's here is something that to the best of my knowledge hasn't been done before, and the results come together in a delightful and fascinating way."

You start out knowing nothing. It tells you to move with the arrow keys and that's it. Awesome! So I go exploring and see little foreign cubes and pyramids and wormy things. Awesome! I approach one and see four little stats or something appear above it, with little symbols by each stats. I don't know what those mean, but great! More mystery! Some of the little cubes speak a different language. I find out I can collect little foreign sentences, which will help me decode the language. Great concept! I wanted to find all the sentences!But then I found a coin. Great! What's this do? I see a menu appear on the right of the screen. 1/100 next to a coin picture... Oh. Well. That's a lot of coins. What do they do? Then I find a relic. 1/250 or some high number like that. What?? A gem: 1/75. What is this? I don't care about any of that. But that's the majority of the game. Explore new areas (they all look the same: grey until you get there and add color) and collect useless stuff. I never could understand the foreign cubes (the translation tool was crap; a programmer needs to sit down for a week and make the interface more usable). I never figured out what the stats were all about. And how could I with all the fluff in between me and the riddles' answers?"
,Recommended,261960,9564836,"Posted: 19 March, 2014",all,anatha ☄,"I want to emphasize  that the game says ""arbitrary"" in its title. Is it a little slow? Yes. Does it baby the players with a tutorial at the beginning and leaves figuring out the nuances of the game almost exclusively to the player's curiosity? For sure. But that's part of the joy--a randomness that's difficult to pin down to a pattern.Cube&Star is colorful, minimalistic, smart, darkly and subtly funny (the Nietzchean quips from the various geometric creatures make me alternate between wanting to laugh or cry), and aesthetically exquisite. It wasn't hard to fall for the simplicity of this game, and I more than appreciate how relaxed I can feel playing it without it being totally mind-numbing.It's casual but quietly rewarding, and well worth it. I recommend it wholeheartedly to both the whimsical and patient player looking for something a little different, if not Euclidean."

76561198067858587,Recommended,261960,12320775,"Posted: 1 October, 2014",all,LobstarJ,"Cube & Star: A Love of Life and of the Arbitrary.  This is a very simple yet complex game.  The controls are few and guidance is absent which leaves most players lost looking for the point.  I was drawn to Cube & Star by the beautiful design and the colors; I played because I enjoyed spreading the color.  The question this game brings up is ""What is the point?""  Cube & Star is similar to life, the search for meaning.  As I spread color, I discovered the purpose of the tiles that I collected- they create life.  Originally, I only payed attention to my effect on the landscape but soon found out that the game is more widespread than that.  Now I watch as each action my cube takes affects the entire realm of the game from changing simple colors to creating life that changes the face of the map in their own way.  This is a game for people who enjoy the search for purpose."

,Recommended,261960,9602221,"Posted: 22 March, 2014",all,Jestern,"This game is absolutly wonderful.  Initially I wanted to find the goal of the game but soon I found myself so wrapped up in enjoying the experiance as a whole to care if there was an end or how I should go about reaching it.  This game is VERY artistic, and peppered with cleaver meta-level metaphores about life and existance, though thinking about the dialog is purely optional.  Its a sandbox where your free to color the world however you see fit!  At its core the mechanics involve collecting which are your way of interacting with a living, breathing, highly abstract world.  As you explore you'll gain a few abilities, tons of collectables and build/burn the world as you please.  Strangly enough, its by far the most relaxing game I've ever met and as I colored the world I found myself rather happy, as my progress was simply making the world a more colorful place rather then the collectables.  It's been a long time since I've met a game that doesn't feel compelled to string me along with a stick and carrot, but freedom from those chains to play in a quirky, colorful sandbox with no real threats has changed my ideas of what a game can, and possiably should be.  Sadly, I can't really tell you why its so relaxing or happy, you'll just have to find out for youself."

The massive amounts of achievements that this game has are pointless and range from literally pressing a button to actually impossible. No joke it is impossible to color the entire world because of how ♥♥♥♥ed the map and npc's are, first of all the map is huge and its going to take at least an hour to get a chunk of it done, secondly some npcs also spread around there own colors so you have to cover there colors up with you own, and finally the map doesn't tell you the difference between the colors your spreading and the colors the npc are spreading so its impossible to even finsih the main goal of the game. Overall its a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that even if i was payed to beat this game i would not."
,Recommended,261960,9129519,"Posted: 15 February, 2014",all,TheCrazyKiwiLady,I completely adore this game! It is a very simplistic exploration game where you bring color to the world. I haven't decrypted any of the journals yet and that will be a challenge on it's own. It's one of those games where I can just relax and let the color flow. I don't usuall play games with the sound on but the music is very charming and I find myself tuning on the volume for this game. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for soething to unwind with after a long day.

,Recommended,261960,14725783,"Posted: 2 March, 2015",all,Majora,"Cube and Star is essentially a Zen sand garden. If you go looking for meaning, then the game will oblige with some light brainteasers, but if you want to ignore all that and just bounce around daubing the world in pale citrine and nightmare red, you go bounce. It's a pleasantly relaxing experience.

If you are looking for action you're going to be disappointed but if you just want to relax and just DO something, it might be for you.
