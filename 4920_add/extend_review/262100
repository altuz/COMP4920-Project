In short, it's sort of a Smash Bros. take on 2D arena combat games like... well, like Soldat. Except it's kind of pared down. You have two real game modes: free-for-all and team play, supporting up to 4 and 8 players respectively. The twist is that nobody ever dies; although you score ""kills"" for walloping the hell out of another player, it's more like a game of tag. If you're ""killed"" you're reduced to crawling and hopping around at a gimped rate, and can't attack. If you can snag a random medkit, you're back in the game but the healthier players can and will swipe these to keep them from you.There are all of two modes available: Free-for-all deathmatch, and team play (4 and 8 players respectively). Free-for-all is simply a series of single-screen arenas that will shuffle when one player is left standing, and the first one to 10 kills wins. Team play features objectives like ""reach the other team's end zone"" and maybe other stuff I dunno.When starting a game you can pick a class that determines what two things you can do; sniper can disguise as a bush and snipe, demolitions can chuck missiles and set mines disguised as crates, etc. This is all well and good, but... it's where I start to realize that the game is minimalist to a fault.There are two bare-bones game modes. The maximum players in any game is either 4 or 8, even online. The arenas are tiny. You have two action buttons per character. Only the winner gets coins to spend in the lobby, on things like booze, coffee, costumes, and pets which only persist in the lobby where you can't really do anything. On top of all this the game's color palette, which while undoubtedly an accurate recreation of an EGA palette or something, hurts my eyes. It's predominantly sickly tones of yellow, brown, and green.And finally, we're about two days out from the Steam launch and the servers are DEAD. As I type this there are no player-hosted servers, and nobody at all on the US server. There was apparently a record of 31 people playing throughout the entire day.I admire the concept and it's briefly amusing to watch the sprites ragdoll all over the place, but I just don't think it has an ounce of staying power as it is now. It looks like it's maybe still in active development(?), but if that's the case it really should've been listed as Early Access.Please just put Soldat on Steam, already."
,Recommended,262100,22328257,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,Drake,"Fast, accessible and completely hilarious mayhem. You have two game modes to choose from and one of the best online multiplayer lobbies I've ever seen in my life. There is the Skirmish mode, which is a free for all single life per round game mode. First to get eight kills wins the match. Second there is the Run mode, two teams try to reach the opposite side of the map. First team to cross, or eliminate the other team, wins. Match is the best of five rounds. There are simple yet distinct classes to choose from, based on classic shooter archetypes.And the lobby is seriously entertaining too. Hang out and chat at the barrista, play a pick up game of 2D basketball, or pick up a fancy outfit or a pet. Of course you can always spend your hard earned winnings the old fashioned way and get hammered at the bar.The game also boasts crisp and responsive controls and totally over the top physics. Round that out with online and local multiplayer with full bot support so you never have to go without a game. Totally worth the price of entry and then some."

Its visuals have a charme that is appealing to me, but:(at first, but this is a one time negative: Fullscreen does not run with Windows 10 without deactivating ""High DPI Mode"". Once you fixed that, it's fine.)- The game's menu is not controllable without a keyboard: Want to play in your livingroom? Always have to connect your keyboard- Controllers are buggy. We always had one controller controling two players at the same time. Making this not playable with 4 players.- The game's controlscheme consists of 2 buttons + a joystick. While this is not necessarily bad, I feel that lots of opportunities are missed here.- 0 configuration offered: Always play until 8 points. That's it. We couldn't even disable bots.Sorry. I loved King Arthur's Gold and even though I knew this would be simpler, it did not deserve the blind trust I had in the studio."
76561198039311458,Not Recommended,262100,23778045,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Landmeow,"So I bought this game thinking it would be like KAG (King Arthurs Gold) or similiar to the quality or depth of KAG with mechanical differences. To my suprise the game lacks really any depth and while I didnt play it for very long I was hit with immediate problems. First the resoulution is strange and smaller than what 1920x1080 is atleast thats what I was using. That aside I was brought to a screen asking for a username and then controls but apparently I needed an account so I was ""Landmeow9"". The controls are oddly mapped considering this game came out this year and from the same devs of KAG I don't understand why movement is mapped to arrow keys and actions to Z and X. As I went through I found it littered with  weird design choices and not what I expected. Not to mention a glitch with trying to play single player, worked the second time. Then after being in singleplayer finally being able to play the game I found it...lacking. Maybe I was comparing it to much KAG, and I'am comparing as it is the only other game from these devs. While its neat it just feels like it needs a bit more polish. Id say buy it if its cheap and maybe wait if until servers get more populated and the game functions a little better, though im not sure if it will. I will not be playing this Im sorry maybe I had a bad first experience but unless Im convinced otherwise this game isn't really worth the buy unless on sale, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR LOOKING FOR DEPTH LIKE KAG."

76561198173606567,Not Recommended,262100,33022007,Posted: 29 June,all,KeinSchiesse,"My experience with the game was limited to its main ""Run"" mode. Unfortunately, even accepting that the game's extremely limited player precision, weapons, effects, enemies, and level variety are somewhat inherent to the retro genre it portrays, I would not recommend this game even to diehard fans of retro / 8-bit, as its gameplay is so utterly simplistic and inaccurate.I had no idea I was buying some ""arena"" game where the primary purpose is moving from left to right on very small maps before the opposing team (or  in my experience, bots...) gets to their ""side of the level"" first. It's a really odd mechanic and doesn't seem to fit this design very well. The game itself lacks much of the implied ""fast pace"" action as seen in the trailers, and instead you meander your way from left to right (or right to left) over a short distance within a limited 1:00 minute time span for each map, clumsily lining up shots and grenades and hoping you can make it to your side of the level first instead of the other team. The strange multiplayer insistence really hinders what could have been a cool aesthetic for a military game with a campaign / progressive levels with more of a through line. Instead, you face off on 5 levels which all mostly look the same (this one has snow though!) to see who can get to their side first the most, best out of 5.Your character despite having full controller support seems to steer incredibly vaguely, with there not even being a traditional jump button. Instead you hold right and / or up / down and watch as your character automatically bounds over whatever is front of them, which makes for really imprecise shooting. You can't seem to aim up or down with your regular machine gun. You can stop to press A to awkwardly align a reticle over the area you want to shoot a missile or grenade toward, but then it's mostly crossing your fingers that the enemies happen to be within range of it, and it seems like most of the time you just end up clipping some outcropping barely in front of you and killing yourself instead. While this is funny the first few times, it makes for a frustrating, inaccurate experience before too long. Your medic seems to crap out health / revival orbs at random and the game advises you to ""stick close to your medic"" but with most all the characters on either side of the game looking like the same pixelated, small design it's hard to distinguish which one that is.The old school military graphics, explosions, and ragdolling / amputated crawling the characters do all looks good, and overall the design / aesthetics replicate the feel of an old NES game well. The sound effects seem fitting to the events on screen with funny but brief character moans and screams amidst explosions and the like. The soundtrack is easily the worst part of the game for me with its incredibly repetitive, out-of-place plunky / lighthearted guitar and feels more like they're squeezing out a song made for the main menu across every single level. It reflects the light-heartedness of the game, but I wonder if the game had embodied more of a Medal of Honor / epic orchestral type soundtrack if it would have been a little more immersive and less elephant in the room, in your face all the time.It appears only 2 people made this game for what it's worth. While it was worth a chuckle or two and I think the graphical style is cool, I will be trying to get a refund. It may be more fun local coop in its versus mode, however I never had the chance to play this option. I could see it still wearing thin pretty quickly."

76561198030904467,Recommended,262100,22344118,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,Uint,"Trench Run is a 2D multiplayer shooter that is exclusively about shooting people, blowing them up, and having fun in the processThe gameplay is very simple: you control your characters using only only 2 buttons and direction keys (you could play with a NES controller), the maps are small, there's no story, no base-building, no leveling system… You can immediately buy the game, join a server and blow stuff up. The game is very fast paced, with explosions all over the place, corpses flying across the map, buildings getting blown up, it's very hectic and hilarious to see.There are 5 classes available that play quite differently:- the assault has an automatic rifle and grenades- the demolition has a rocket launcher and C4- the commando has a knife, flash grenades, can climb walls and defuse C4- the sniper has a sniper and can camouflage- the medic, only available in “Run” mode, has a shield, ammo boxes, and can revive his teammatesThere are 2 game modes: Run and Skirmish. Skirmish is self-explanatory, it's 4 players trying to kill each other, the player with the most kills win.Run is a team vs team mode where the goal is to run to the other end of the map while dodging enemies and killing them. There's a bit of tactic involved : you can try to be sneaky, hiding in a bush or using a flash grenade, or defend a strategical corridor from a window, or be a medic and help your teammates with ammo and health.Outside of the 2 main modes there's a lobby where players can meet in between matches, chat, play basketball, buy pets and costumes and drink beers.There could easily be new modes, maps and even classes created for the game as it's entirely moddable, and you can run your own private servers.So this game is awesome, but it has a population problem. There's generally always someone to play with, but the most I've seen online was 6 players and sometimes I have to wait 10 minutes in the lobby for someone to connect. You can still play with bots, they're not too bad, but playing with real people is obviously way more fun. If you're lucky and have irl friends who are into fun games, you could play with them in local multiplayer too (up to 4 players)."

The core game itself is pretty shallow. There are two game modes. One is FFA, and one is Team Battle mode. The games last on average between 2-5 minutes. This game is very fast-paced. You will spend an equal time waiting between matches as you will playing them.The game tries to redeem itself with a lobby area. Here you can buy things with coins (earned from winning games) such as beer, wine, clothes, pets. This part of the game feels pretty tacked on, and is unrelated to the main part of the game. There are not very many people online right now, and filling up games is very difficult. The game seems to be using the exact same engine as KAG, which makes the experience feel more like a cheap reskin than a full new game.I felt the core game to be pretty uninteresting, and you can see the majority of gameplay in about 20 minutes. This game definitely feels like an Early Access game, and I was suprised it wasn't one. I hope the developers can turn it around, because at the moment I feel that purchasing this game is not worth the price."
