Furthermore, after almost a year on Early Access the port of TS1 to the TS Complete engine is bad, very bad, with many balance breaking gameplay implementations mostly because some of the turrets and units are just re-skins of Cold War ones, and lotsa missing sounds, with Signal simply stating, ooops!!! Some things just won't be ported!!Now, the biggest issue for many, multiplayer will remain locked at 30fps, that's if you have a helluva great internet connection to avoid the harsh frame drops, below 30 of course, and annoying desyncs.If you want to play TS Cold War, get it on a -75% sale, otherwise, look elsewhere, stop supporting Unethical Studios abusing the Early Access program on SteamUPDATEOn Feb 17, 2016, the game is finally out of Early Access, but:The desyncs have not been completely fixedThe MP 30fps cap staysThe TS1 portion of the game still pales in comparison to the originalAfter almost two years on EAP, the game was first released on Feb 28, 2014, they just couldn't get it right. I guess that when you choose to dedicate a big portion of development time to work in another project, things don't quite come out right:http://archive.is/Ldhks"

My  review is aimed at people who really care about co-op.As a solo experience, Toy Soldiers is great.  However, If you're like me and thought about buying Toy Soldiers to play with friends, WAIT UNTIL THE MULTIPLAYER BUGS ARE FIXED.  I really can't stress that enough.  This game currently has desynchronization problems that make it unplayable for many people.  You may go several levels without the problem, but often your connection will sever and you'll both drop from the game.  As far as I can tell, retrying over and over will not ""luck"" your way past the bug.  Once you encounter it, its a wall you can't get past.  It's extremely frustrating and it's been an issue for months.  I realize this game is Early Access, but it deserves criticism as a standalone product if money is involved.  So consider yourself warned.Toy Soldiers is a great game on Xbox Live (good enough to buy it again on the PC) and I hope to one day see it fully operational on the PC, but until this game-breaking issue is resolved, I can't recommend it as a co-op experience."

,Not Recommended,262120,32783823,Posted: 25 June,all,Pèpè Silvia,"While the concept is really cool and the core game is pretty damn fun; the controls and camera views really drag the enjoyment factor down. For some God-awful reason they used a turn-based strategy control scheme in an RTS tower\defense game; it makes absolutely no sense.I was constantly fighting to put the camera where I need it to see wtf is going on. For some reason the camera doesn't pan vertically, so you're stuck with a very narrow view of the battlefield which has enemies coming from all angles. There is a top-down view that shows much more of the battlefield, but it's probably the most boring way to play the game.With the tilt\pan camera, you have to constanlty be scrolling over the battlefield because the view is so restricted. But that leads to another annoying issue when the scrolling will pause if the mouse cursor passes over emplacements. There's absolutely no reason for it other than to make scrolling around even more difficult.The unit menus have a radial-type menu where you select upgrades and actions. However, once a unit has been highlighted, left-clicking ANYWHERE else on the screen will complete the highlighted action; even if your mouse pointer is nowhere near the button. Again, it makes no sense and is annoying if you just want to click on another unit.Controlling units (mainly aircraft) can be difficult because of the forced mouse accelleration. Control can act anywhere from sluggsh to super twitchy\sensitive, absolutely no consistancy. One second you're doing Immelmans, the next you're stuck in a turn and can't pull out fast enough. There is no rudder control, and using the ""roll"" controls didn't seem to work for me.Maybe it plays better with a gamepad since it is a console port; but dear god...if you don't like to constantly get frustrated by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera angles and♥♥♥♥♥♥poor controls then avoid at all costs.The controls are my only real complaint in this otherwise fun and addicting game; I'd only recommend when it's on a steep sale and you have some extra patience.6/10"

,Recommended,262120,10293839,"Posted: 30 May, 2014",all,Clegg Buvins,"PROS- Tower defence with fully 3D environments, creeps and weapon behaviors- Turrets are varied and use ballistics, as well as AI aiming, instead of automatic guaranteed damage outputs- Player can control fully fleshed out turrets or vehicles to take part in the defence, not just a gimmick- GI Joe/Cold War 1980s trimmings, with historical weapons and creeps and a good amount of tongue-in-cheek- Visuals and sound are excellent (for a game from 2011) Players can also joyfully destroy most level features, leaving levels looking war torn.CONS- World War 1 content, whilst expanded, is inferior to the original Toy Soldiers game. Game breaking bugs etc- Multiplayer issues - DO NOT EXPECT ONLINE MULTIPLAYER TO WORK, split screen is great fun- Will not appeal to those fond of tower defence games full of numbers and fixed variables, or players who don't find the ""random and whacky"" nature of AI aiming and projectile physics to be enjoyable.If you're a tower defense fan but tired of strict grid-and-number affairs, give Toy Soldiers a try. If you've got any interest in 20th century military history, give Toy Soldiers a try.Instead of coldly precise towers on a grid issuing 10 points of damage every 2.5 seconds to the nearest creep, Toy Soldiers has machine guns snaking lead around the heads of Russian troops, or surface-to-air missiles casting smoky trails as they home in on supersonic US Tomcat jets. A proper realtime game with physics and 3D projectiles instead of simply disguised dice rolls hitting HP sponges.As opposed to weighing up number based tower upgrades, area-of-effects and watching hundreds of creeps marching in a static laneway Toy Soldiers brings real time chaos and player controlled action to the mix. Build your turrets and watch their various attacks interact with the environment and enemy waves without the spreadsheet-precision of regular TD games. Take control of turrets yourself and chain up combos to unleash powerful player controlled call-ins, or hop into a vacant helicopter or tank to sweep the battlefield clean of enemies yourself.Oozing with charm and  great ""modelling diorama"" asthetics Toy Soldiers is a breakout from the tower defense mould. Containing both the grim madness of the WW1 Western Front as well as the over-the-top 1980s Cold War, Toy Soldiers is a delightful mix of historical homage and video game fun. Contains the best representation of WW1 in a game I've seen, though perhaps the original, un-tweaked Toy Soldiers game nails it better. Only time will tell if TS:C improves or degrades the WW1 content.[UPDATE - Sadly it seems that the World War 1 content is doomed to be buggy and generally inferior to the original, but such is the effect of porting an older game into a newer game engine. Still, the very well polished Cold War aspect of the game is extremely worth the purchase.]"

The porting of that game to PC was done surprisingly well. The end result was a great little RTS game based on kids toys for the PC that was very fun and enjoyable.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=425501280Now, flash forward a few years, and you have this endeavor. An attempt to bring the entire Toy Soldiers universe into one game for the PC. Most of this game was never available on the PC before. In it's current form as of my writing this review, it still has some bugs and is missing some content. But based on past experiences with the previous port, and the fact that the game is around 90% complete, I can highly recommend this game. Just be aware.. it isn't 100% done yet.I dunno if it is the strategy part, the pace, or fps aspects.. but I love this game.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=420103475And the whole toy story motif makes this one of the only games I would be willing to just sit and watch someone play. Watching toy planes bomb toy tanks while an old desk lamp from above lights the play surface.. it's art. So five stars and two thumbs up. If you like art, wrapped in fun, hidden inside a game...http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=425501632you'll like this game. And if you were a child who grew up in the seventies or eighties and played with toy soldiers.. make sure you have your heart medicine with you before you start playing.. cuz your heart may just burst with joy."
76561198098290580,Not Recommended,262120,31703588,Posted: 12 May,all,Legion2183,"I'm going to start out by saying I love Toy Soldiers. I played 75+ hours of the original's console version both on and off-line. It had a unique charm to it that felt like the developer's really took time in crafting a unique IP into a full fleshed out and realized game. If you have the chance to play the original I'd highly recommend it. It has its own unique sense of quirkiness and has a lot of twists on the Tower Defense Genre of games that make the level enjoyable to play over and over again. Part of the original's charm too was that the levels were challenging, but if you mastered those twists on the gameplay mechanics, and did well enough in the early rounds you could gradually build a fortress of defensive lines no one could penetrate.All of that makes what I am about to say that much harder. I can't recommend this game to nearly anyone in its current condition. The game has an excessive number of bugs for me which is odd considering that it runs fine with only a few frame rate drops sporadically. Units will fall through the map constantly for me to the point where some entire waves of enemies may as well not have spawned because they didn't even come into line of my forward gun positions. At the time of writing this I have beat every campaign and DLC in the game, except for the original Toy Soldier's main German campaign, and I have won literally every boss battle since the tutorial by the boss spawning, and then immediately dropping through the map only to despawn and be considered destroyed. Then a message pops up telling me congratulations your victory, though I never fired a shot. The game will also crash randomly on me during map loading or when a new wave spawns. Other times heat seeking missiles will just decide that they are not locked on and stop tracking the target half way through their flight. This is honestly astounding to me considering how much the original impressed me. I haven't been able to find anything on message boards saying that this is unique to a specific build or version, but I know that this is happening fairly frequently to others as well.Even when the game is not being a bug parade, the balancing is very messed up. There are some enemies that are capable of sustaining multiple direct hits from max upgraded artillery. This is fine on its own. In small batches it is a fun challenge to try and crush these bullet sponges as they drive up to your front line. The issue is when the developer has built a wave of these enemies that has 15 of these storming at you full speed, and the map only has two places to set artillery pieces it. Any other gun placement can barely touch these enemy types, and they will routinely break your lines causing you to leave the fun of building your base/ piloting a vehicle to turn around and mop up the remnants. In addition to this, the buildup of challenge is more of a cliff face than a traditional learning curve. Enemy waves start out with low armor and low numbers, but in the last five waves will ramp up to dozens of layered enemy types that are bullet sponges, some of whom can also just run over emplacements, destroying them in the process. The game at this point quickly becomes a test of how quickly can you spend money to get your gun emplacements back before the next wave, and this becomes tedious at best.In its current version I would go so far as to say the game is unplayable. To me that is a tremendous shame. The original brought me many hours of enjoyment with friends and by replaying the campaigns for their challenges to unlock various war memorabilia (another feature stripped from this version). This feels like a game that has lost any care that was originally placed into its IP. It comes across as a hollowed shell of a concept, filled with half-finished gameplay mechanics that was slapped together and never tested before release. Seeing as it has been out for a while not, and from what I can tell there have been little efforts to address these issues, I would say Signal Studios has given up on this project entirely. I emphatically do not recommend this game to fans of the genre and would recommend either trying to find a copy of the original for console or to look elsewhere if you are interested in something like this game, because what we were given can barely count as one."

A few year went by with TS: Cold War being released but for the most part I had moved on from the 100+ hours of thee original TS. Then I saw TS: complete on steam. Those nosatalgic memories flooded back seeing TS on PC! So I bought the game (and yes I knew it was Early access) and began to see some problems. First of all the game is locked to 30 FPS which isn't a big deal to me so I looked past it. But when playing I saw that the game wasn't very optimised for mouse and keyboard. The key layouts were weird to say the least but again it wasn't a big deal to me. So I complete Cold war, now I move on to my WW I toy chest...Wait what... What in the hell did they do??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! THEY F***** UP TS 1... HOOOOOW? I mean like... Well like... AAAAHHH!!!(3 minutes of freaking out later)Ok, now that I'm a litte bit more calm let me tell you what they did... They copied over the units and the engine of Cold War... Like no joke, let me give you an example... In cold war you could get a ""special"" ability for killing so many soldiers in a certain amout of time, those ablities could be nukes, lasers, AC 130's ect... So in TS 1 I got a ""special"" ability, and guess what it was... A MOTHER F***** ORBITAL LASER... IN WW I NON THE LESS... *facepalm*... And thats not it, like i said units (being turrets) changed form what was originally in TS 1... When I looked at the game it wasn't the same game I played for so many hours... It saddens me to see how little the Devs care for the game, If you're a fan of this game from the 360... Don't buy this game, you'll only be disapointed... :("

It's fun and has a good bit of challenge. A good unit variety to shoot at and fun turrets to upgrade and use. Yes, you can man the turrets yourself (Except in the General game mode) and shoot at the enemy.You can also drive and pilot a variety of tanks, aircraft and choppers to help destroy the enemy. Vehicles run on batteries and will eventually run out unless charged up again. Don't worry about them getting blown up or the charge expiring. On most difficulties and modes they respawn and recharge after destruction so you can continue your rampage.The bosses are interesting though some are VERY annoying.One thing to mention is that you can play any of the four factions (Cold War US and Soviets, WW1 British and Germany) in any combinations in multiplayer. WW1 Germany against Cold War Soviets anyone?"

Local multiplayer has some serious bugs (one example is having to jump before being able to sprint) and the online multiplayer is non existant, something the community has been asking to be fixed I'd imagine since the game was released on early access in 2014. I love Toy Soldiers, although if you are looking to play the game, I'd reccomend just waiting for the War Chest sequel because this game is honestly a waste of money, and as much as I'd like to say that it is a waste of money ""for now"" I don't think the devs care enough to update the game.

Multiplayer doesn't even work at all much to my chargin and while all the DLC is free, you probably won't play through most of it before getting fed up with the bugs and quitting.This is one of the reasons why people don't buy early access games, and why I can't trust companies like this anymore. If the developers didn't screw around and actually fix the issues like they said they would, this game would be my favorite game to play on Steam, but for now it'll just sit in my library as I hope they try again to make this game right.TL;DR: don't buy this game, it's buggy as hell.

There could be more better fixes to the bugs and more ideas that they knew they could have added then again it would have caused more bugs further delaying the time of the game such as the idea of a naval fight it would be good but would be tedious if it had HQ, Reguardless the game overall is great I think it should have a demo for those into stradegy games its one of the greats."

However, my gripes are with the amount of bugs in this currently which greatly hinder that previous experience I had on the console version. Short list of them so far:- Crashes when completing levels, causing me to have to replay them all over again which is especially fraustrating.- Gunfire sounds being non existant.- Music being non existant except in the menu's.- When launching planes they sometimes blow up instantly for no reason.- Planes in the WW1 Campaigns help pop-ups are those of the Vietnam era.- Planes in the WW1 Campaigns having the sonic boom effect, which happens constantly.These aren't exactly game breaking bugs other than the crashes but they are certainly annoying. Hoping these get sorted out soon."

An intrinsic part of Toy Soldiers is the player's ability to take control of towers and units to give them more powerful effects. It adds a good amount of action to the game and in my opinion makes it well worth playing.
,Recommended,262120,17467246,"Posted: 9 August, 2015",all,Nightmare Duckie,"The first Toy Soldiers is one of my all time favorite games. The fact that this has the original Toy Soldiers and all of its DLC AND the second Toy Soldier and all of ITS DLC for $10 is amazing. At the time of writing this review I have 1.6 hours clocked in and have barley worked through the first campaign of the Cold War part, this pack gives you a lot of bang for your buck.I grew up playing countless tower defense flash games and this game is by far the best in the tower defense genre I have played. The selling-point mechanic that sets this game apart from other tower defense games is that you can take control of your various towers and vehicles on the map to fight the waves of enemies head on. While controlling a tower the game will give it bonus abilities, for example an AI mortar tower will fire one round then aim and fire again; when the play controls that same tower they can now fire three mortars in quick succession or take control of one fired shell, altering its course slightly and speed dramatically. However you can play the entire game without touching a vehicle or controlling a tower and play it as any other tower defense game, the vehicles and tower control will just give you that extra edge when things get tense and enemies slip through the lines.This game is beautifully themed and designed, all the soldiers, vehicles, towers, and environments are in the style of an old war diorama model kit. The vehicles are all wind up, the soldiers are all display figures, the towers are all little glued together models, and the maps all take place in open model terrain cases, complete with painted cardboard sky and cloud borders on maps that give you a plane.One of my favorite parts of the game is the ability to pause it at any time and enter ""Tilt-Shift mode"" which brings the depth of field and focal point really close up and drops the camera to near the ground so you can take some awesome screenshots, check out my Toy Soldiers screenshots on my profile for some examples.The maps offer a fair bit of challenge to them but you can always make it harder by playing on a harder difficultly. There are other gamemodes like Survival and with this complete pack there's even multiplayer, but I haven't tried that out yet.A final note is that the music and sound design is superb, Signal has really made a great game, I consider this my 'perfect game' for this genre."

I played it with a different friend a long time ago and I remember the experience completely differently on Xbox. When we played this we had multiple connection issues whenever you desync you restart the round and desyncs were frequent.The frame rate made it even worse of an experience, it felt just above 30 for a bit but once more than 5 enemies appeared on screen it would just tank down to 10-20 fps. I'm using a GTX 1070 so I shouldnt be having this kind of an issue with an old game like this.Despite having aweful connection, and terrible frame rate, the ai will make the game trivial and too easy. Even playing on hard mode despite the setbacks we could complete mission with much trouble. The ai path finding on this game can be completely broken. Half of the wave will come out of the gate, line up an then stop. They just don't move and wait for you to gun them down. It was completely uninteresting shooting at non-moving enemies who don't even fight back.This is a minor point, but controls were pretty inconveniant I know I could remap everything however controling vehicles and missles were a hassle. Turning was so slow you would often miss the mark or crash for not turnign fast enough.I'm sure some fan boys of the game will find a way to justify these things and say ""works 4 me""TL;DR: Terrible port, bad controls, aweful fps, bad connections and an ai that doesnt even work."

I played the original Toy Soldiers on Xbox 360 as well as Cold War.  I remember back in the day I was enchanted by the fun of the cartoony men and wind-em-up tanks.  The little pop of a toy as I nailed it at 100 meters with my sniper tower.  The tension of that one enemy troop nearly making it into my beloved toybox.  I poured a lot of time into the 360 version.  It was fun.Now on my PC rig I have that same pleasure!  The game is still fun.  For me the biggest pro in favor of this game: the shear time pleasing experience.  It is a basic tower defence with good character.  The controls are fluid and easy to use(with a controller).  The environment is somewhat destructible and generally nice to fly around.  The base setup is well thought out and variously flavored.However, this game does suffer from a few technical errors.  The frame rate is generally good but can be susceptible to some drops.  A few bugs here and there, but nothing to really turn me off to the game.To round up, the game is fun.  It has a nice feel even though it can be a bit buggy.  So, if you can not stand a few bugs, this title is not for you.  But, if you are looking for a good title that is a bunch of fun, certainly pick this one up on sale. Cheers!"

Minus 1 mission (More on that later).Toy Soliders Complete is the original Toy Soldiers tower defense game along with its 2 expansions and the Cold War stand-alone with it's two expansions.Tower Defense, eh?The basic game loop:- You can place turrets in specific locations. Certain turrets (like ani-air and artillery) require larger spaces. Upgrade turrets and fend off the invading forces.## The main difference here is that you can both directly control any turret giving you more accuracy and better kill counts, as well as using various level-specific vehicles which run on batteries.Pros:- Great aesthetic. Love the fact that all the levels are like in a kids room.- Level design is generally good. Sometimes i was able to place down turrets and then sit back for a round or two and let them go to down on stuff. Other times, there were bosses that would instant kill my turrets. But overall, I feel it was well done.-Lots of levels.- Survival and vs modes (didnt play vs),The Bad- Over the course of the game, I ran into 2 hard crashes to desktop and one instance where an enemy soldier didnt move and I had to hunt him down after the level was basically over. Over the course of 15 hours this doesnt seem like a huge deal.- I literally cant play the last mission of the main cold war campaign because it hard crashes to desktop on the loading screen. So thats annoying. Beat everything else though with no simialr issues,Overall:While this is still in early access, it generally feels like a finished game with a few annoying bugs, Gameplay-wise I say it is worth it. I am a bit annoyed I cant play one level, but thats one in a lot, so whatever. I do hope they fix it."
76561198087077872,Recommended,262120,33745067,Posted: 23 July,all,Pappagiorgio,"Buggy, yet quite unique take on the tower defense genre. Unfortunately, it left Early Access too soon and seems more-or-less abandoned at this point, as if the devs had decided to prioritize other titles instead. Scumbag move! But if this game works for you and the bugs aren't too distracting, like the lack of music in-game, then it's hard to put down. The units are all awesome, and you can take direct control of ALL of them, and then of some other extra air and ground units at your disposal, so you can take matter on your own hands if things get to hectic, like a F-14 Tomcat, an Apache helicopter, WWI era tanks or the Red Baron's own aircraft just to mention some. From WWI to the Cold War, there's lots of content here and factions, all DLCs for both games are already included, so lots of hours of fun.Quite strategic in its use of units and upgrades, since every upgrade comes with side effects, like longer reloading times for WWI era artillery, or with different effects in the case of modern American artillery -spread instead of direct ammo/howitzer with precise munitions vs barrage of MLRS- or a mortar emplacement with bio-chemical ammo that later can be turned into a flamethrower and then into a regular mortar with napalm effects, each with their own pluses and cons. To add variety to an already varied game, you can make use of random special powers, abilities and you can also take control of a hero, but it's not really necessary, and that's only if you manage to obtain them by killing enemy units directly in a combo. The bosses are awesome, they're these humongous machines that dwarf any other units so they're always fun and interesting to fight.Having said that, I would give this game a neutral rating due to the Early Access blunder and amount of bugs, and the lack of in-game music really pisses me off. But this being Steam, it's either a thumbs down a thumbs up, so I'm going with a positive rating overall since I did indeed enjoy my time with Toy Soldiers: Complete."

The exclusion or better yet elimanition of GFWL in this game makes it playable in offline mode which is a plus. I should've known this was coming out before I bought the first one, could've saved money....but TS: Cold War is only on PC through this game. I can't wait for them to include TS 1. There is a lot of bugs and the game does crash ocasionally, but this is in Early Access so what do you expect? This a defenite buy here.""No, it's not a defenite buy. Take a look at my new review for this game:Toy Soldiers Complete....what can I say about it. Well I can say  it's only half of a good game.  Cold War is awesome, it has explosions, easy to learn mechanics, and overall good gameplay (and the DLC is free!).  There are a few issues in Cold War but are not very noticeable. TS1 in this game....sucks.  There are so many problems with TS1 in this game.  I own the original Toy Soldiers, so when I bought TS:C I expected TS1 to be an exact port, but I was wrong.  SO MANY GLITCHES can be found in TS1 in this game, and even after a new update comes out some glitches still remain unfixed (and continuously remain unfixed even after constant updates).  Signal Studios tried to combine what they did in Cold War in their ""remastered"" version of TS1,  by adding Turbo Charge, Barrages, and other things, but these additions only reduced the quality of the game.  The barrages in the TS:C version of TS1 are just the Cold War barrages but polished to look different, and I'm pretty sure World War I nor Toy Soldiers 1 had an orbital laser, it's just madness!   Signal Studios should've just stuck to their guns, but they justhadto add something new.  I get that Signal Studios wanted to balance the games so in VS. mode one team couldn't have a higher advantage over the other, but what they did here was just terrible. Here is a list of 10 glitches and inaccuracies in this version of TS1 included in this game:1) Whenever the Chemical Level 3 is used, it leaves behind the gas cloud and it loops over and over.2) Whenever the Machine Gun Level 3 is used, the muzzle can be quite blinding.3) Some enemy units are overpowered and have way too much health.4) The Anti-Air guns have this annoying gravity bullet velocity that forces you to shoot higher and due to this renders the Anti-Air gun's AI to be completely useless.5) The Anti-Tank guns are just the models of the Level 3 Anti-Infantry guns taken from the original TS1.6) TS1 bosses have a bit too little health.7) The Machine Gun models are also taken from TS1, which is ok, but the models are from the wrong parts of the game.8) The Sniper Tower is really just a Machine Gun Level 2 but modified.9) The Mortars have the same effects from Cold War.10) The sounds for the Chemicals Levels 1 and 2 are swapped.There's plenty more glitches and inaccuracies in this version of TS1.  If you want Cold War on PC,  go ahead, buy this acursed thing. If you don't have TS1 and instead buy this game thinking it has the original TS1, you'll be very disappointed.  The only thing that's worth buying in this game is Cold War, but that's about it. This game is only half good and half completed. Cold War is ok; but TS1 in this game sucks. If I were you, I wouldn't buy it. Instead I'd wait for Toy Soldiers: War Chest to come out and then buy the original, 100% authentic, no doubt about it, not sheet TS1 on PC. The original TS1 does have Windows Live Arcade and it forces you to play online, but just deal with it, be glad it has SteamWorks at least.Thank goodness Ubisoft is making the next Toy Soldiers, because I think they will do a whole lot better job than Signal Studios ever did with this damn game.  I know this game is still in Early Access, but this is just lousy.4.8/10"

The war theme combines history with a tongue in cheek atmosphere and truly separates the game from other tower defence titles, the WW1 theme of TS1 in particular is brilliant. What makes this game different from other tower defence games is that you can actually control via third person the weapons, defences and vehicles that you place on the map at any time. Vehicles like tanks, helicopters and planes as well as the sniper tower are particularly fun to use.  Additionally this game is great value for the price as it comes with 2 different TS games and all their DLC. Highly recommended.Edit: The latest patch that has recently come out has fixed many of the in-game bugs which existed, at least in single player. Can't say if multi player issues have been addressed yet."

Not a deep game, but good light entertainment. As a kid, I loved to play with plastic toy soldiers and this game may be thought of as seeing those childhood games come to life, including the embellishments of a child's imagination. In contrast to some other reviewers, I found the Cold War missions to be generally bug free and stable. There is the very occasional crash to desktop, but otherwise Toy Soldiers functions well. For those of you who have played the original Toy Soldiers, the Great War missions in this version are similar, but not exactly the same. The ability to earn barrages (one-shot area effect attacks) is a nice addition, but I think that the balance is off on some of the missions compared to the original. One difficulty that affects both the Great War and Cold War parts of the game is that control of fixed-aircraft almost requires a gamepad or joystick. The original Toy Soldiers worked just fine with keyboard and mouse, but this version does not use keyboard input, making planes almost unplayable with a mouse only. I found it possible to complete the missions without using the jets or biplanes. Helicopters work just fine."

After finding the origional Toy solider back on the Xbox marketplace, I was immediately taken in by the perfect balance between tower defense, RTS, and a bit of some 3rd person shooting elements. The WWI theme was well executed and the ""fiction"" aspects, such as the rare tanks and bosses, only further developed the theme.The series continues by extending into the Cold War. Just like before, the mixture of gameplay styles blend well together and the theme is noticeable. However, despite the ""raw fun"" gameplay; there are some issues. The user interface isn't as intuitive as before; as switching/selecting units can be difficult at times, due to some wonky hit boxes and camera angles. There are also their far share of bugs, ranging from hilarious to game breaking. On one hand, the game froze but was quick to recover to a good auto-save system; on the other hand, two bosses fell threw the stage and were killed near immediately. This left me more disappointed than anything else, as I really do enjoy the creative boss fights.Overall, the polish isn't there but it is clear that the dev team made an effort to create a fun/unique experience that builds of the previous game."

No amount of reloading or replaying the map will stop it from sinking into the map. This particular defect has been outstanding for at least a couple of months.The AI is fairly useless, for example in Cold War series, on the map where you have helicopters flying in, the biggest suite of defects is that the Tank Destroyer AI turrets will not fire at anything that is not on your side of the map, refusing to fire at anything on the Soviet side of the map, unless you are personally controlling them. What makes it a real challenge is the fact that you are revealed to have two HQs, one on the Soviet side of the map (what should be the Soviet toybox is actually your 2nd toybox), that you can't properly defend (because surprise surprise you can't put turrets on the Soviet side to defend it). So one set of enemy tanks start on the Soviet side and then stream into your Soviet-side HQ and the rest of the vehicles/ tanks stream into the actual US HQ (toy box) on your side of the map. So because you have 2 HQs, you lose the scenario even faster. Oh yes and the 2nd Soviet Anti-Aircraft battery that you are meant to destroy is also missing.In this particular scenario, when left to the AI, not enough cash is racked up to aid with selling battery emplacements to allow you to buy anti-aircraft (armoured Soviet helicopters) batteries (and you need at least 4, or 2 upgraded with you controlling one) to defeat the helicopters. Of course then you have virtually no funds left to sell the anti-aircraft batteries and replace them with machine-gun batteries to defend vs the final level.The other major defect is not being able to freely scroll over the map, you are forced to select an battery emplacement and use it to bug out and select another battery to move over the battlefield. Trying to scroll or move the view to see another battery and the game simply prevents you from doing anything. You are stuck in a corner or a useless part of the map, unable to scroll or move your focus.This game is far from Complete, more like Alpha test with a LOT of outstanding basic game handling concepts yet to be resolved."

,Recommended,262120,19218823,"Posted: 22 November, 2015",all,JZELA1023,As of now the game is very well optimized even though there are bugs which I have only experience two bugs but nothing major the game is very fun to play with friends and even fun by yourself. I would highly recommend this game for those seeking a Tower Defense game that offers more than the typical Tower Defense games out there. I would also like to add that a great feature for this game would be Steam Workshop the game would benefit so much. The way I would see this being integrated in the game would be by making custom maps with custom layouts for the turrets and maybe creating individual turrets from scratch it would make the game more diverse as it would provide an endless amount of options to choose from. This will make the game more innovative and replayable as the creativity would be endless and would provide a gaming atmosphere that any gamer would be interested in as they would choose the maps based on their criteria.

It quickly became very addictive. I bought this game as it was on sale, hoping that if I ever wanted to play it, I could stay on steam. I also saw new features involved. I bought this and discovered a nasty surprise: When I operate turrets or vehicles, I lack the ability to turn right eith my mouse. Every other function worked in the game. When outside of a turrets or vehicles I did just fine. I also discovered they removed verses mode for the classic toy soldiers. I am unable to play much in the game due to the mouse problem though. Topping that with removing instead of improving my favorite verses, I was disappointed with the game. However, as I suspect nobody else is complaining about turning issues, I shall still recommend this game. Good work Signal Studios."

The game has been revamped since the xbox version giving all the stuff the Cold war game to the first one improving the experience.The only real issues i have with this game is the camera angles they are really shoddy and are very restrictive in terms of movements, the mouse locking to towers is also really annoying i'm not playing with a console controller this really shouldn't be necessary. The only other problem i have is that the camera locks to certain parts of the map not allowing you to look across it all i don't see why the camera is restricted like this since you can see that way if you tilt your camera anyway so why not just unlock the camera?Other than that this game is pretty solid and fun to play by yourself or with a few friends on survival or versus.I rate this game a 7/10"

I would give this a personal 4/5, the only thing keeping the game from a perfect score is the fact that it crashes randomly, and whenever I try to play Survival mode, at least in Toy Soldiers Classic."

But, the game obviously needs work at over a year in EA.  That's not a good thing.It's playable; it's fun, but there are techincal issues that need to be fixed.Limited weapon platforms (where you can place a weapon) is obvioulsly done on purpose, but it trades off the posibility of boredom.You can't make a maze.  I thought WW1 was trench warfare.  Did they make mazes with trenches?  I'll Google it ... BRB ... Google says yeah, they made mazes with trenches.  Go figure.I reluctantly recommend because the game is more than playable; it's a different take on TD; it has plenty of DLC to endulge in, and the dev. seems to be back working on the game.  I don't have any real regrets for buying it."

It was amazing. Now, it's just as amazing. And people complain about all the bugs and glitches, but I haven't encountered many. Plus, now that War Chest is out the developers will focus more on this game. The gameplay itself is the best tower defense game I've ever played and it's much more creative than other tower defense games. You can also play online with your friends which is a blast, but lag will sometimes occur. Overall, it's an early access game that feels much like the original games with improvements, and also some early access shortcomings (glitches/bugs, interruptions, the game isn't complete, etc.) I give it a solid 9/10! (Mostly because the original games were amazing)."

(edit) Okay maybe I was a little unjust this game has a very cool concept and overall is great. Though my computer for some reason can't handle it and bugs out and lags so hard whenever I try to play. But overall anyway this is a really good game."

I have tried playing this game over many connections and all say they are catching up with a slow network connection.MORE INFORMATION REGARDING ONLINE MULTIPLAYEROnce loaded you will have a game that is playing around a quarter of real time. This will happen regardless of your internet connection speed, tests have shown that there is more than enough network bandwidth on the network and connection yet the game still insists that the network is slow and reduces its speed to a crawl!"
