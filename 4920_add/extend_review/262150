,Not Recommended,262150,28443769,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,爱阔少,"First of all, this is not a bad game and I actually love it. I give a thumb down here just to remind you guys don't instant buy, read a few lines below please.It was originally released as a free game back in 2009, made by only one guy. And the free version is now still on thedeveloper's blog. If you just want to have a try, just go there and grab it. Pretty much the same as steam version, except it's Japanese. Well, who cares. And if you really love the original version and want to support the developer or donate some money like me, come back and buy it. (I've no idea whether the money still goes to the developer though)It was a great game then. My mind was blown when I first saw this game. I can't imagine how much time it takes a single person to draw all the high quality pixel arts frame by frame for 11 main characters + 5 support characters. I can't believe a free game has so many voice actors. The controll is a bit clunky and maybe it needs a lot of balancing, (You know, fighting games need lots of test plays and feedbacks to do the balancing, it's just impossible for an one man developer to achieve that) I still enjoyed it for a long time.But what has eigoManga done when they put this hidden gem on Steam? Let me tell you:- DLC contents that was all in the original free game, yes unbelievable.- Bad localization, some stuff not explained. Even the command list have mistakes, and never fixed.- No technical improvements. The game was made with a dated engine called 2D Fighter Maker 2nd(2001). Low resolution, no support for 16:9 fullscreen, very limited settings can't adjust sound volume, bad controller support. All these were OK when it's a free game, but if you are trying to sell something on Steam, please at least be professional.- A practice stage happens every time you start the story mode, in which you have to win 5 rounds against a standing still AI.- Add a game mode which you fight with 2 AIs together, I don't know what's fun in this. When I stand between them I don't have any idea which direction is which and how to do a special move.- Add some maps/backgrounds that aren't as good as those in the original game. Some are just like taken from a photo and reduced to 256 color. (due to the engine limit) They don't even try to fix some artifacts.- Sell fanmade artworks for money.Thank you for reading so much. As I said, if you are intrested in this game, or you want a few more pantus and waifus, go try the free game. After reading all these and you still sure you want to donate some money, then buy it, maybe on a sale."

The only way to play/move the characters is using the analog stick or the keyboard, and I dislike using either for a fighting game. Changing the buttons used for up/down and left/right is not possible.I hope, that they'll fix this, because, to be honest, I have enjoyed playing the bit that I have played. I'm not going to give the game a negative recommendation because of this problem either, because it's a personal preference."
,Not Recommended,262150,9336504,"Posted: 3 March, 2014",all,luker,"So right off the bat I have to point out one important thing: this was originally a freeware game that has apparently had a few bugfixes? and localization. Not much has changed from the original state besides the addition of English for the very ignorable plot.Knowing that, it's much more ridiculous how bad a deal this is technically. Nothing has changed from the freeware state, which raises the question of why should you pay for it.The game doesn't have selectable resolutions so good luck keeping aspect ratio as you pull the window larger. The original resolution is very tiny as a result of using an extremely old and dated engine, Fighter Maker 2k. On top of that, it doesn't recognize my arcade stick's directional inputs. I suspect it won't register the POV hat as directions, and there's no way to change it. I resorted to Joy2Key; good job, game I paid money for.Once you get the game running how you want it, there's no training mode to mess around with. You've got ""Story"" (arcade mode) and versus modes and that's it. There's no sort of tutorial and the manual is a mess. The manual constantly refers to buttons as ABXY instead of something more easily parsed like ABCD, which took some getting used to just to read it.After jumping into the arcade mode and skipping past most of the translated text because it was immediately noninteresting, I messed around in the actual game itself, and wasn't really impressed there. The attacks are a simple Light, Medium, and Heavy system with an extra button for your assist character, who you also pick at the character select screen. This was a neat idea, but I didn't like the way it felt because the assist character moves around at a sort of lag compared to your character. On top of that, the assist characters are little girls not that much shorter than the other girls you play, so on screen it gets kinda busy and hard to read the situation. The UI in general is underwhelming. The biggest flaw is in the super and assist meters. You require meter in your assist meter to do anything with the assist attacks, but the meter is so small at the bottom of the screen that you have to strain yourself to read it.It's very clear a lot of work went into animating the game, and the animation is very fluid as a result. Unfortunately the designs leave a lot to be desired, as most are generic anime shlock, with a more adult oriented costume theme (man that final boss was silly looking). The assist characters are all little girls, and the regular characters are plucked from anime stereotypes. Uninspiring and unrelatable, and also not very good for the image of women in video games.Overall the technical issues on top of the poor UI design and bad choices for sprite design with the assist characters make the game more of a headache to bother with. I played through with one character and I was done. If you want titilation go watch porn. If you want an anime fighting game and don't care about netplay BlazBlue Calamity Trigger just got released on Steam and has actual UI design and works with controllers."

In fact, I really like it. I dont think it would be completely worth full price (unless you included all DLC's and some extra features like binding your own keys or online play) unless you are really a huge fan of anime fighters. I got it for $2.50, not horrible. Anyways, let me toss ya' some pros and cons.ProsBeautiful anime art style.Now uncensored with moreoppaiandpantyshots! (There never was much to censor either way...)Trading cards and badges.Unique ""helper""or ""support"" character gameplay.High frame level from start.Simple gameplay (some might find that as a con, but its a pro in my book!).ConsOnly 2 gamemodes, Arcade and local VS.No online gameplay.Wont keep your interest for too long, as it can get boring after time.No tutorials, you kind of have to figure out the controls on your own.To end this review, I will rate this game a 7/10. The style and art is great, the gameplay is simple, and is the perfect thing to play when you want someting casual. If your a game collector, get this. If you like slightly ecchi anime or fighters, you should also get this."

Originally, a freeware game, this game remained very similar to  the freeware version. First off, there is a compatibility issue with Windows 8. Any system with Windows 8 or newer cannot launch the game in full screen mode without the resolution messing up. Adjusting the settings and Windows compatibility mode does not resolve the problem.In addition, the story for this game has no plot devices. Compared to other 2D fighters, it failed in all aspects. With a cluttered UI, unorganized story mode, and confusing versus mode, the game is a disaster. The only appeal it has is the girls and the ""kawaii"" theme. However, this appeal is also lacking too. Until Vanguard Princess gets a major overhaul, steer clear of this game.Rating: 0.5/10 (5%)No AchievementsGame Done."

Catchy music, great sprite art and one of the best displays of pixel animation I've seen, this is actually some pretty quality stuff. Once you actually play with another person who knows the game, it's very absurd, yet very fun and easy to learn. whether your on a  fightstick, keyboard, or controllersnone of the inputs are overwhelmingand can be mastered with abit of practice.While the game itself is simple, there is not much in terms of content as it is a doujin-soft that was orginally freeware. It's still nice to see doujin soft appear on the steam market.There was a netcode patch for the freeware version, but if it gets patched into this version that would be great. (They did note that they will be updating this game, so there is hope)This current version of the game seems to be slighty different from 1.08, and the port itself was made from the permission of Suge9 for the2011 Japan Earthquake for fundraising at anime expos.While its not the best, it was done with good intent and what needs to be there is there. As in what the revenue is going towards, we don't know possibly more work done on the game.The cast consits of all kinds of fighting game playstyles from: Eri the rekka, Luna the stance switcher, to even a loli that is the grappler. All of which have glorified panty-flashes(lol).PIXELMOE(7.5)/10, the price of the game makes sense, even with a local-only play it's still great cheap fighting fun.Hell if your really cheap you can just download the free version. Google it, it will pop up instantly.If you are playing with another person its 8.5/10 levels of fun. It's easily worth 4.99$.If your looking for something different form the usual fighting game, and have some buddies over I reccomend picking this up for some controller-tossing laughs.

I have found it to be both noisy and brightly colored. It will occasionally react to keyboard input, although it is crucially missing the ""Just dispense the tradng cards already"" button. Rumor has it that that will be in the next DLC.In combat, you must choose the direction of attack and movement (presumably combined because moving in one direction and attacking in the other would weaken the dimensional infrastructure), and the type of attack (Weak, Normal, Strong). My personal favorite is ""Weak"" - because really, why bother with an attack unless it's a really weak one.Character selection screen needs some work, as you can't get a really good feel for the interpersonal relationships between the primary fighter and her assistant or cosmetologist or whatever the second girl is supposed to be for. I mean sure, Kaede can use ""Godspeed Bloodbath"" (actual in-game move name, BTW), but is Hilda really down with that? She really strikes me more as a ""heavy on the bloodbath part, ease off on the Godspeed"", so you know, maybe some ideological differences down the road there.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys pressing the attack key quite often. Also if you feel that the current crop of games have too many pants-wearing characters. Because they don't have that in this game. Overall, a good design choice, as the money that could have been spent on pants went instead to some stellar voice acting talent. When they grunt with exertion or make a surprised exclamation, it's like you are actually there. More to the point, it's like real life because there are no apparent audio controls.Finally as a service to those who were looking a ""how anime is it""? breakdown: It is slightly more chibi than Skyrim, somewhere between Farming SImulator and Payday 2 in kawaii and moe, and more loli and  ecchi than DOTA.Bottom line: If you DO like anime and DON'T like pants, you'll like this game."

The only set back is the resolution is limited since it was done on the Fighter Maker 2nd, and so when you play full screen will have to fiddle with the screen or just play windowed.

There's not much info like tutorial and combos in practice mode and practice mode is hidden as well, however it only took me 2 hours to become decent with Yui after watching basic combos online (practical ones, not just for practice mode) to understand the mechanics. The only downside I can think of is that Hilda (last boss) is stupidly cheap with its spammy attacks, so to beat her you need to abuse your character's skills as well.On the plus side, the characters are all diverse and the assist system makes for interesting combos. The game loading is impressively fast and the visuals are good. The fanservice is actually not that much and hardly noticeable (Shame actually since that's what I was looking for)For the DLCs, the Lilith is same as the base one but the AIs are a lot harder.Kurumi DLC is the most worth it since it adds two modes, Streak(Survival) where you fight different AIs with just one HP bar. A bit buggy though. Other is Team battle where you actually fight two AIs at the same time. It's really fun if you want more challenge if you find hard mode to be not enoughBTW x360ce doesn't work so my generic usb controller needs a bit of configuration, but not much of an issue.

The game seems to be pretty buggy. And since it has such a low price it may be tempting to get, but I strongly suggest looking into another title *cough* *COUGH* Skull Girls *cough*"

A controller is really the only way to play effectively.And the review:As I said in the TL;DR version, this is a fighting game with a horrible story, some cheap boss moves, a few interesting fight/game mechanics and a tokyo sized dump of pantsu anime waifu ecchi fanservice oppai cleavage showing spectacular. That's pretty much it. There's no online play only local vs mode and an arcade mode that is really linear and with no options to change anything or view anything. Also there's no pause menu, but you can pause and view what the controls are.Let's see, there's around 10 characters: a loli with a pedo bear, I mean teddy bear, that grapples, a school girl, a sports girl, etc etc etc, and a Tenchi Muyo Ryoko-esq girl with big guns and pistols. wait big oppai and pistols.. oh and she's not wearing any pantsu... So there's that. Also there's a set of 5 sub characters that support your fighter as you fight, which is that interesting game mechanic I mentioned. The artwork is pretty good and the backgrounds are interesting and vary in style from one to the next, so it's nice not playing cookie cutter levels every single level, but this is a 2d fighting game so it's not like you can really enjoy the game's scenery when you're button mashing hard with only one hand on the controller. FYI you can play with two hands, but only if you're a member of /r/nofap.Seriously though, This game is probably worth 5 bucks if this is your sort of thing and 2-4 hours of gameplay is justifiable to you, otherwise get it on sale, as I've seen it go on sale frequently. And again don't buy the Hilda Rize DLC cause you get that for free in the Lilith DLC, along with 2 more stages and some better songs. Imo the Lillith DLC is barely worth it at 50% off when I got it, but it literally adds almost nothing to the game (except Hilda) so it's purely cosmetic. They could easily add another stage or a campaign mode with a map or something, but as this was an already released game long ago and this is a newer updated version with exxxtra pantsu I will continue to support it. Actually if they made a CP2 wait I mean VP2 then I'd support them as long as they don't cut as many corners as they did here."

Keep in mind this is doujin fighting game so i bought this game not expecting much, and well it did ""slightly"" exceed my expectations.Visually this game is beautiful, anime styled graphics with *ahem2* characters who well, pretty much sums up anime industry nowadays. Also gotta love the skill cut-ins and the victory animations . Since it looks fluid, well and the fanservice and stuff >////<. Audio and OSTs in this game is ok, but not much , i can't really remember any of the tracks @@Gameplay is neat, however take into consideration that when they said it is a 2v2 fighting game, it is more of a 1 main 1 assist kinda game, you never really get to control your partner and there are only 5 partners to choose from. I find this game quite easy to pickup since most normals do a lot of damage and some specials do super's level of damage(the supers don't do much damage) The character roster is small but complete since you have your grappler, projectile spammer, rushdown chara etc. (though no charge or trap type characters :c , but i guess this is to help to keep the game simple)Would i recommend it? Yes and no. Yes if you are a huge fighting game fan and have some basic knowledge on FGC. If you are looking to take a break from competitive games like USFIV or DOA5 or something and just want to have casual fanservice fun with your perverted mates, Go on ahead, this is very worth the price tag. No if you are looking for something deep, if there is anything this game lacks, it is content, no online play, no unlockables, pretty much what you see is what you get. Oh and although this game is easy to pickup, for newcomers to the FGC, skip this, not because it's hard but due to the game not giving any help and guide whatsoever, you are left to search for it yourself which may be a deterrent for newcomers :cThe nicest thing to say about this is it is a well rounded, simple and fun 2d fighter for anime/fighter fans can enjoy. To put it in the worst way possible is that this is a poor perverted man's version of Arcana Heart 3 and Skullgirls.P/S: Lock the doors before playing this game, you'll thank me later c:"

I'm a long time fighting game player, so it was quite easy to pick up the basics of this game.It's got a neat twist on the use of assists. Rather than just a single button press, you can use directions in addition to the press and the assists will do different things (depending on the amount of meter they have.)There's a button mapped just for parries and that can be a more advanced tactic than your standard figting game. I did not have any problems with the use of a fight stick. Everything worked right on the first try. I am not sure what the bug is that is causing other users to have issues with fightpads/sticks.I installed the Director's Cut, but I didn't see any of the ""mature"" content. It flies by so fast that you really have to be looking for it. (or just check the community hub, they've spent the time and taken screen shots). The tiny resolution is a bit of a pain, as you're going to have to guess on the proper aspect ratio when enlarging the screen.Overall, I'm happy to have purchaed it, I look forward to seeing how different assists compliment the main characters. I see the promise of some obnoxious juggles. (juggles, not jiggles).   It looks to be a solid game and I hope people do not overlook it due to the anime style."

The fights went pretty fast and unless you know your character, it's hard to know what you are doing. However, once you mastered the controls of a character, fights became really intense where your reactivity is brought to its limits. Moreover, it's a trully beautiful games, using japanese manga style graphics (which I love). Musics, voices and sounds are also good and manage successfully to instaure a good atmosphere.I must insist on the fact that it is a hard game, a VERY hard game, and it is really pleasant to see one which can resist you because those games are really rare nowadays. But, this statement is also a drawback as, in hard mode, the final boss is sincerely unbeatable (I only manage to beat him twice in more than 10 hours of playing). This is the main flaw of this game : its final boss is just going to drive you mad. I do not understand the interest of setting a boss like that, because, that character aside, there is really a good balance between the different fighters. But, Hilda, the final Boss, she is definitely broken. Of course the final boss is powerful, but it should not be that much. Fact is she can attack you from distance instantly and without any pause. She can also teleport when engage in hand-to-hand combat. So, I do not know how the IA of character is made, but she will keep spamming lasers and explosions without any delay from the other side of the arena, and if you manage to get close, most of time she will teleport instantly.Appart from having hulk as a boss, playing Vanguard Princess is very refreashing and amusing. Combos are well thought, and the game has a good lifespan. An excellent game for a small price, I encourage you to buy and play it (I recommend you to play with a joypad because some techniques are very hard to make using keypad only).8/10 according to me.PS : if you want to see what the boss is really capable of, buy the DLC ;)"

The moves are incredible, simple enought o be able to pull off whilst button mashing but still good enough that you'll be able to put them to good use if you know what you're doing. I honestly found myself just button mashing for a fair while haha.You get 2 modes Arcade and VS, it does support DS3 controllers via better DS3 and 360 controllers though you'll have to fiddle with settings a tad to get them managable. The menu sits in a toolbar on the screen window so if you are fullscreen you'll need to hit f4 to access it which can be a pain. For versus, changing stages is also done via the window toolbar which is sloppy but hey, it's not game-breaking.What can be game-breaking is the game's occasional all-out refusal to accept any input commands resulting in an 'I.T. Crowd' esque, turning it off and on again.

Luna-a gunslinger, bounty hunter. Able to change stances with each special melee or shot of the gun. Must maintain bullets for effective momentum. Very open to attack when reloading. If you ever played Guilty Gear Xrd, Sin is the same way, having to eat to keep strong gameplay but not as open to attack like Luna's reload specials.2. Lilith-self proclaimed daughter of satan. Grappler, more similiar to king of fighter grapple style characters.-(Shermie or Yashiro or Clark or even Alex from sf3) She one of the funnest grapplers to play as cause of the humor she brings and the suprising power her grab specials displays. Feels like she came from Disgaea series.3. Natalia-religious fighter with a pile bunker on her arm from an unknown nation.Specials are like boxer from street fighter except she can go through projectile with her dash punches. Has a great command grab special to make her even more dangerous up close.4./5. Saki and Yui-both resemble more to ky/sol of guilt gear or kyo/iori of king of fighters of this game. Both are sword wielders.Saki can range easier with projectiles cause she has normals that summon petals fast and Yui has slower/long reaching normals/physical specials that stuns longer but she summons petals at much lower rate. They do not resemble each other what so ever in animation or appearance like those I mentioned above. What I like about them is what they should do to Ryu/Ken/Akuma.6. Ayane-archer with waning powers. Lost her eye in the past. maybe the fastest range attack in the game. Range expert. Arrows regenerate in time-4 max.7. Kaede-assassin with no memory of her past. A very mobile character with adon style(jaguar tooth in a way) wall attacks and plenty of feint specials.8. Kurumi-a average looking girl with unique powers. The assist expert that does co op attacks with them. Can combo some of her normals into each other. The dlc 5th assist, I dont think she has any co op attacks with that one. Not sure about the 4rth assist either since I dont use her much.9. Eri-Tonfa expert and a super soldier suprising enough.-you wouldnt know from what shes wearing. Close range master. Specials hit overhead or low or even behind.10. Haruka-mage. Another range expert. Can set up temporary walls that damage foes on contact to stall them.4 ASSIST CHOICES if you got the free directors cut add on, dont know why you wouldnt get that free add on-(5 if you have the dlc one which isnt really worth the cash)(Not all specials or super moves or unique normals are listed in the manual like Lilith s flame thrower. Some characters even have second supers.)The GOODGameplayIt is actually a 2d side scroll 1 on 1 with asist partners. All fighters are female. Street Fighter Third Strike parry system. Counter hit combo advantages. asist penalties also work well to make sure you cant go crazy with your helper asists.  The voice overs are jpnese.(thank god cause most dubbed va are usually bad) Combos are exact and strict which is good for serious pvp. Cannot just cancel normals into special moves, forcing players to think on how to use their assist for combos or defense.good looking 2d fighter with detailed sprites on fighters and backgrounds. Smooth animations.compatible with controller pad(not sure on which ones though. I know it works with my afterglow ps3 and my wired 360 one)Not just a broken combo crazy game like marvel vs capcom 3. Rewards great defensive play if you work hard to master it.THE BADonly 2 modes.vs offline mode(not designed well practice mode. mostly just using 2 player as a dummy) and arcade.(arcade has easy, normal and hard setting.) Needs way more modes.Cheap last boss at the end of arcade mode. Rivals SNK s annoying bosses. Close range characters like Lilith will get destroyed a ton when you reach the boss. The easiest way to beat her is time out with range asist. A chip battle. Trying to KO her will get you killed. She has infinite helper spam too that will kill your close range approach.Conclusiondespite there only  being 3 modes, you can appreciate the creativeness of the game. very nice looking 2d fighter. I recommend it cause it has more creativity/better looking than street fighter 4 and its only indie game too. It has alot of defensive depth which is rare on new gen fighters these days. Rewards reaction on counter hits, footies and great space control as well.-like street fighter. 3 out of 5. It would be a 4 if it had more modes of play, a great fighting game has a overall well rounded strength in all aspects, not just focused on one strength. This title has creativity/one of the best looking 2d fighters, great combat gameplay and amazing matching voice over talent to the characters."

Which means: few characters (it may turn some people down, but I miss those [OLD] times when you had only a dozen of characters to choose from. Modern games with their 30, 40 characters to choose from are usually overwhelming), few special moves (and easy, classic ones like ""hadouken"" or ""shoruyken"" motions), basic combos;- Good character design! This is a mash up of all the anime cliches will find out there. If you are an Anime fan, you'll most likely recognize the ""base"" of a lot of characters there;- Music and sounds (with voice!) are actually good also;- And if you are really, really ecchi, you'll definetly enjoy big boobed girls teamed-up with flat-chested pre-teen ones.- Nice playability. I haven't played much (beat the game a couple of times on Normal difficulty) to state that, but it seems the game has even some depth of play. Although it's simple to pick up and play, it seems to offer something more;- Cheap!The negatives:- Like other people said, the Interface is a bit rough on the edges (to say the least). No in-game option menu, no native controller support (it may sound weird, but the whole interface has an RPG Maker feeling to it!) and so on;- No easily accessible Move List (although, personally, I come from a time where games didn't give you in-game Move List. If you didn't have the manual at hand, you pretty much had to figure it out yourself. I've done that dozens of times in my child/teenagehood. So, newer generations, stop complaining!);- AI may seem kinda cheap at first, but once you get the hang of it, you realise that the AI is actually poor. You can beat the game almost only with normal moves (yes, Hilda included! She has a 'pattern' to attack that you once realise and fit that pattern into you character's style of gameplay, she isn't that hard at all).So, bottom line is:If you are into anime girls, wants an honest ecchi game, with actual nice gameplay (don't just expect a Street Fighter Alpha level of playability, though!), a game that is straight-to-the-action (although a bit TOO straight), with an honest cheap price, I can not see why not recommend it.Don't expect much and you can have a couple of hours of fun!"

First off while I don't love fighting games I do enjoy them from time to time. So this isn't going to go in depth into mechincs and such. With than said this game is ok. The fighting works, and the graphics bring back old school SNES memories. However this game has 3 huge flaws.1) the controls to navigate the menues are TERRIBLE. Nothing is explained, so half the time when I was trying to navigate I would just get thrust into a game.2) Almost no ingame menu. Instead of an ingame menu it has a top task bar menu in windowed mode. The ingame menu is nothing more than a pause screen with basic controls. Worst is there is no audio menu, so you have to adjust audio through Windows. This is really cruel since this game started at 100% volume. So don't do what I did and look for an ingame audio menu. Just turn it down through Windows.3) No real tutorial. It has a 2P practice mode, but no AI tutorial mode. The game also doesn't have a move list even in 2P practice. So you'll have to download the manual for the game. This reminds me of games like the original Mortal Kombat, but I've been spoiled by games like Darksiders, and MvC that give me an ingame mvoe list, and full tutorial. The manual is essential since it explains a lot about the game, that isn't in the game.Again, I would say it's an ok game to bum around in, but don't expect MvC, or Street Fighter levels of production, or features. Also this was my first impression rather than an indepth review of all the features, mechanics, story, etc."

It's just another fighting game.Aside from it being a 2v2 Assist fighting game, the art/graphics in this game and fighting style does make it stand out compared to the other games. Who doesn't like girls fighting against one another in a struggle for glory? While the game itself offers very little, the actual fighting portion is very enjoyable, but maybe too difficult. Mashing buttons as a beginner, or performing combos as an experienced verteran, this game is worth playing a few times times over.There are very little choices in the main menu; but, on the character selection screen, you can mix and match mostly any two characters of your liking. Even though there's a decent roster to choose from, there aren't too many characters you're probably used to having in modern fighting games. Unfortunately, these characters are also divided into 2 categories: the Fighter themselves and the Assist Character. You must select one of each.Using a controller seems to work by ""chance"". while some controllers work great and have no problems, others would fail on a button or two. It really does confuse you on whether it's the game or the controller that's causing the problem. I prefer to use my keyboard in my opinion. At least the computer knows that each key works. The mapping for the controller is also a basic, click to assign button, and actually pressing the button you want to assign it to. The problem lies in the analog stick. While some people don't mind using the analog stick in their gamepad, others find it simpler to use the D-Pad. However, as far as I know, the game would not let me use my D-Pad. It could just be by ""chance"" but I didn't think playing comfortably would be so difficult.And lastly, from the forums and the internet, many have found Vanguard Princess a disappointment because of the lack in progress. As the developer brings up an idea for the future, the spotlight shines away. This caused people to believe that bringing in campaigns and such to be ""a scam for your money"" and is not to be trusted until improvments has been occuring.What hurts more is how there is a free version of the game as well, but audio/text would be in another language.I personally bought this game in support. I have seen many small companies or just a single person, bring a game to life and cross harsh paths or even stop their dream because of competitions, old engines, or even because no one would realise it's potential; and when you reach out to your fans who bought the game, they won't even offer help out because are aren't doing so well in creating your game. There are millions of problems that can cause games to suffer and eventually, become nothing more than history.I personally see a bit of potential in this game, despite the many people that disagree with me and despite the fact that the game has progress nowhere for a long time. I just believe that hard work needs to be done. It is a difficult job to bring something to life and to keep it alive.Buying in this game is really up to you. If you want to support, buy this game. If not, I believe the internet is your friend that will find a nice alternative."

,Recommended,262150,12231562,"Posted: 25 September, 2014",all,DRUNK_CANADIAN,"Vanguard Princess is a single player 2D fighter with easy to learn combos and an ""interesting"" cast of characters. It is a 2v2 style fighter in that you select a primary fighter and an assisting fighter, the majority of combinations are tied to the primary fighter with the secondary being controlled through a button bind which acts in the same manner as one of your attacks (weak/heavy, punch/kick etc.). This design element adds great value and unique gameplay as you can mix and match primary fighters with assist fighters to a variety of effects and combo potentials. The game does feel cheap by certain design choices (character/UI/mode wise), but considering it is an indie project with a very small development the value is outstanding albeit odd for this game as it offers quality graphics, balance and gameplay. Recommended for fighting game fans if you can get past the design choices."

The characters are interesting, the mechanics are (mostly) fair, and the game brings all the things you like from various fighters; Some of the characters even have similar movement and strategy schemes from classic titles like Street Fighter, KOF and Guilty Gear. Plus, you have your Arcana Heart buddy system, only your buddy can get knocked away and disabled temporarily like in Marvel vs. Capcom. Best of all, your guard cancels are free -Yes, free! They cost no special meter- and almost all of your combos come off guard cancels perfectly. Moreover, grabs are crucial as well as corner management, cross-ups and tripping.Some of the problems you're going to dislike are, the training mode is wonky and hard to figure out how to enable. The D pad on your Xbox controller is going to require some manual configuration in Xinput. The pause does not allow you to see your character sprite and freeze frame to oogle your favorite animation frames. No online play or direct connect means you're gonna be playing by yourself a lot. Worst of all, special moves that require you to press two buttons do NOT go off the way you want them to; The timing is somehow different from how you input other arrow/button combinations to do other moves.All in all, it's fun for what it is and it isn't expensive. 9 out of 10. I'll grade sequels and future updates more harshly. It's been several years since the release, so I gotta believe better things are coming from the devs."

Also don't buy this unless you have local friends and competition because it doesn't have online matchmaking as far as the normal purchase goes.This is not Marvel or even Skullgirls and it may not even have much in common with current era Street Fighter. It's good old fashion SNK mentality and hard as balls combos. Or you could just play Lilith and use her command grab. But the universal assist system is probably Vanguard Princess' greatest selling point, even if there are only roughly three to four assists to pick from."

,Recommended,262150,13136786,"Posted: 28 November, 2014",all,AddleTwintone,"After an hour of playing, I am more than equipped to give my thoughts about this game.Score: 7.5/10++Fluid animation+Variety of characters (plus 2 more if you buy the Lilith DLC. Lilith DLC includes Hilda.)++Really nice music+Awesome anime girls (moe and panty shots included)--Insane learning curve-Semi-difficult with keyboard alone+/-Almost all characters share the same combo/Special Move inputs (this could be good/bad depending on your view)[[ IF YOU PLAY KEYBOARD STYLE LIKE ME, DISABLE THE GAME CONTROLER OPTION VIA GAME MENU AND REBIND KEYS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ]]As I'm used to these types of fighting games I mostly saw BlazeBlue in this and thought it was pretty similar. I was right. Technically all 2D fighters are the same, but that's another discussion. For the most part I love it. The anime characters are interesting, but with the amount of anime nowadays, you could probably say they remind you of other series/characters--whether in games or another.Jumping straight into the Arcade mode is a very big NO. I got my *** kicked so bad and won the first match by button mashing. The second fight was impossible. Not because it was difficult, it's because I didn't know how to play it. By luck I got back to the menu screen and did a complete overhaul of the keybindings through trial and error. I find it works best if you use ASD for Light, Mid, and Heavy attacks respectively. W for Parry, and Q for support. And the Directional Arrows for movement. This works best for me. After 5min of Arcade sessions for practice you can easily learn many of the combos. I learned all the combos for all the fighters so I know how to challenge them with whichever character I choose to play as. (Versus may not have an AI, but it's perfect for learning how to play the game.)However, the Story mode is still relentless. The difficulty, even knowing how to form combos, was still a little high. The first few matches were easy, but difficulty continues to rise. I haven't beat it yet but I'm sure I will if I sit and focus. Animation wise there's lots of motion. LOTS of motion. Lots of bouncing for each character showing off their assets. Overall it is smooth and seems to flow pretty nicely. The only downside is that you can sometimes see the tiny white pixels around the fighters. They're even noticable in the Character Select screen. This is a small detail I can look over.As for the Support they added into the game. I honestly don't use them. Only rarely do I do or find them useful. The music on the other hand, now that's something to get into. Just about every track--except for maybe three--I really loved causing my foot to tap while I'm laying down combos. (The Shrine music is my favorite.)At this point this is all I really have to say. Hopefully, if you read this, will help those that play Keyboard style. I like Game Controllers as well, but PC games MUST be played using the keyboard. At least for me anyways. It adds a difficulty that many people hate, but is oh so satisfying when you show your stuff."

I'm pretty much an Achievement hunter, and don't play many games unless they have 'em.Second, it needs ""practice mode"" I don't know ANY Fighting game that do not have one to hone skills. The only way you can possibly practice is in VS mode if you have 2 controllers (or using a gamepad and keybaord, if it works like that) it's a bit difficult learning how each character works without that particular mode, that's for sure.If you want to use an XBOX360 Controller, you'll need a 3rd party device for it to work (I.E XBOX360 Gaming reciever) it's a good thing I already owned one, otherwise, this game would be unplayable to me because I hate using the keyboard on these types of games. Some games are meant to use the kaybaord and mouse, and others a controller. if you have an XBOX360 Controller with a 3rd party device, you should be fine.Lastly, if you enjoy boobs, butts and pantsu, then this is the game for you."

,Recommended,262150,9508281,"Posted: 16 March, 2014",all,Aardcore,"I'll be frank with anyone reading this. I didn't know what to really expect from this game since my stigma with fighting games on PC's is a lingering issue, though I come from a long LONG history about them: One Must Fall 2097 and FX Fighter come to mind. Now with that said... I know more and more fighting games are slowly making their way onto Steam, and that's awesome! Show your support with that trend and get this game.Let's also just get some of this stuff out of the way: As you can see from the screenshots, yes... there's a bit of loli going around and scantily clad women--but come on, this is video games we're talking about and a fighting game of this degree needs no explanation or attempt in being subtle... because this is a damn good fighting game. Put the visuals to the side and let them appeal later on, and you'll be all the better for it.This is a fighter I'm trying to wrap my head around because just in the first few minutes of it, I instantly fell in love with it. The animations are beautifully rendered, the sound design is astounding (we're talking late 80's, early 90's sounding arcade sound design here! Just listen to Luna's guns and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about!) and the combat is pretty on point. The drawback is that the game is very... PAINFULLY even, barebones.There are two modes, Story and VS Mode--but no online mode. Story mode isn't exactly your typical ""Story Mode"" from other fighting games which try and set up a story. This is more like a straight up Arcade Mode than anything as you hit up any of the characters and take them for a spin. It's a shame really that there is no online mode because I would definitely love to take up a match against someone else in this game!The game also only has 10 characters, 15 in acuality, but 10 you can actually play as and 5 which are your support class characters. You can't switch to these support class characters, they are there solely for what they're supposed to be: support. Now as for the action in this game? If anyone remembers playing the ORIGINAL Guilty Gear on the Playstation, you've got a pretty good idea what this game feels like. If you haven't, I'll say that this game offers a unique feel and spin on the typical fighting game repetoire. Each character feels unique and play VERY differently from one another, and you'll most likely gravitate to one character that  suits your play style or how comfortably you smash around on the controller.The game isn't without flaws however... given the very bare bones aspect of the game, there are points where the AI will always have the advantage over you and juggle you around. And in a way that might add to the challenge of getting used to the game's fighting system but other people may find that disagreeable.Still, for what the game has, it does everything very well and looks extremely good doing it. It has some disadvantaging quirks but I wholly support more fighting games coming onto PC and to see the company behind this particular title to push something bigger and better down the way for me to pick up, because I'm already a fan of this awesome little game with big potential!"

As I sat there, controller firmly gripped in both hands, struggling to comprehend what I was supposed to be doing or what was taking place on the screen before me, a number of thoughts raced through my mind...-Why did I buy this game? I have close to zero interest in lolis or ecchi or kawaii or anime, hentai, or whatever any of this stuff is called/ might be called by some shmuck like me who (clearly) isn't an otaku and doesn't remotely frequent the kinds of sites or venues that may host that content.-Maybe I know next to nothing about fighting games as well, but come on. This is just like Skullgirls with the multiple characters in fights as assists and fanservice with the all-female roster and jiggling and panties and such, right?-What is happeni...Oh. OH. Oh my. This... this is... I don't even... oh. Okay, wow. That just... whoa.And as I sat, and stared, mesmerized by the gratuitous flurry of events taking place onscreen regardless of my futile attempts at gaining some semblance of logical return for my braindead, pawing inputs on the controller; something magical and/or terrifying was taking place.I could feel, as an acute physical sensation that emanated somewhere beneath my liver, my very own sense of dignity and self-worth slowly, deliberately, yet unmistakably evaporating from each orifice on my body in ascending succession with each passing moment that I continued gawping at the screen and half-consciously pressing buttons. It was magnificent. Sublime, even. Never in all my experience of gaming did I think a game could do such a thing to my mind, to reduce me to such a state. And I'd had my share of uncomfortable and undignified gaming experiences... such as ""enjoying"" (if one could even call it that) the private dances and illicit sexual services in the Grand Theft Auto games, or even playing some games beyond a reasonable point ***cough*** Lollipop Chainsaw ***cough*** to unlock increasingly skimpy (and ultimately unsatisfying) costumes or art galleries.But so far my very short time spent with this game has extended my collective sphere of gaming stimuli beyond simple discomfort or awkwardness to a point that, in my opinion, lands it nowhere short of brilliance. You may take this as saying that I can only recommend the game for the novelty of it alone, but the truth is that the game's content, taken at face value, is on such an off-putting, yet irresistably tantalizing wavelength that I'm enamored with the idea of continuing to play it (preferably with friends), and maybe even learn the ropes of it and become somewhat competent at a fighting game. That is quite an achievement. That is definitely worth my five bucks, and my praise.Overall... what can I say that hasn't already been said here? Either get it or don't. For the sake of influencing your decision, I'll leave with one of the other reviews posted by another user here...""One of the fighters isn't wearing any underwear""That's all you really need to know, right?"

Also the lack of an exit option is another issue that should be dealt with.

Yeah, it's a roster of all “cute” females—and a few that might be overly endowed at that—but there’s so much more here than fan service: it’s a true fighter.I should mention right away that I’m a casual gamer (I’m no pro at fighters) and although having a second character (four all together on the screen after your opponent and their partner) took some time to get use to, the game is easy to initially learn if you take some time in practice mode.While the user interface lacks and getting into practice mode isn’t obvious how to activate, this game is mostly about fighting game mechanics. That said, there are some overpowered characters if you’re playing against other people, but if you like playing against the AI, it’s fun when played casually. There’s some intense combos to learn if you put in the time to learn them; and when you learn to use your partner properly, the results are devastating for your opponents.While most your initial opponent’s AIs will be overly easy, the following ones will progressively get challenging until you get to the end boss that all characters must face. For some characters she can be very challenging. But if you’re not winning after a few tries, go back to “Easy Mode” and practice with different partners until you find the one that suits your needs.While VP is all 2D sprite drawn—and not at the highest resolutions to boot—it’s a beautiful game that makes you feel like you’re fighting in an anime; and the music is some of the best I’ve heard for a fighter. On a larger budget and with a little more character balancing this game could give any top-tier fighter a run for its money. Simply put: at the price they’re asking, buy this game."

These should have already been there, but at least they did go back and add them.Snag this one on sale.At $5 standard I can't quite recommend it as is, even though I enjoy it when I play it.  There are other fighters out there with online play and added modes that are more worth the $5 and above you'd be asked to pay.I will update this review if/when they update the game again and I play it.

I have tried some wonkey pads and they all work well-Top notch local multi. Pick up and play that anyone can enjoy.-I have read that you can play online with some modding, though I have not tried it.Cons:-Interface is bonkers. Changing the vs. level is done in a drop down menu. Wut?-Forced Practice Mode Each time you do the story. It can get pretty irritating.-AI is pretty brutal.

The sprites are detailed, and the animations are fan-freaking-tastic. The music is catchy, the level design is bright(er than it should be sometimes), and all the flashy garnish you'd expect from such a heavily anime'd (probably not a word) title is most certainly present.There's an attempt at a story, though I didn't really care too much about it, cutscenes used here and there, and the endings were a bit odd, but all nice to look at (animated victory screens etc).Unfortunately, the gameplay is where it falls flat. Moves lists are short (and way too many are shared across multiple characters), combos are boring, and wins just don't feel that rewarding. It features the usual mega-cheese-boss from fighting games of yesteryears, but that isn't really a good thing.No proper practice mode, nor in game moves list can be a pain for fighting game nubs, but doesn't really hold seasoned fighting game players back much (or I don't feel it should). The one gripe I truly had was the total lack of explaining what the heck my teammate was supposed to do (and / or how to get them to do anything reliably).It hurts me in a strange way to say it (because I really do love the loveable bits of this game) As a long time, and I mean LONG time (like 25 years long) fighting game player, I can't recommend this title."

There is no way in hell I would recommend those players.  Given that I think Street Fighter IV's tutorial system is half-hearted, this game's complete lack of anything other than ""Arcade"" and ""Versus"" modes unforgivable.  I know it's only $5, but was a bare-bone ""Training"" mode that simply plopped you into a sparring match with an irresponsive but invicible opponent to much to ask for?Also, bonus fail for forcing users to use ALT+F4 to quit the game.  How freakin lazy can one be?If you're a 2D fighting game veteran, thismightbe worth a quick try.  The fighting style reminds me a lot of early SNK titles....which is to say, stiff but serviceable.  The combo counter is never going to get very high, but that's OK.  The side-kick gimmick is neat -- it's not new but very few 2D fighters do it.  But just when you think the game might be OK, you face off against the final boss and run into the mother of all brick walls of difficulty spikes.

Unfortunately, I couldn't, and for a multitude of reasons.First off, let me soften the blow with the positives. The game itself is VERY fun to play. See, I'm trying to look around and find some anime fighters to get into. Now, I know this is in no way similar to games like BlazBlue or Guilty Gear or any of those mainstream fighters, but y'know, I was more than willing to try this out, and when I did play it, I genuinely enjoyed it. The game style is simplistic, but hard to master, and I respect fighters like that. Kind of reminds me of old school fighters where you aren't necessarily trying to be combo heavy (Like... Samurai Showdown, for a good example), and I like that, considering I played the grappler character Lilith. The game looks REAL good for an anime game, but I don't particularly care for graphics in ANY game. All in all, the game is good.Now, let's talk about the faults. No, there are no faults in the gameplay or anything like that, the faults come into some of the things that occur when trying to set up the game. First off, this has very specific controller support, from what I read. I use a Rock Candy  Xbox360 controller for all of my controller support games, one in example being Skullgirls, which is another fighter I play on here. I've tried setting it up in the menu and everything, no dice. To play with said controller, I had to download some sort of program that allowed my controller to do what I want by setting each button and direction to a certain direction. This took me about.... 20 minutes to set it up alone and tweak it to a comfortable level. Next up, full screen for this game isn't truly full screen... You can put it in fullscreen, but it's just a fullscreen version of the windowed version of the game, meaning that you can still see the menu options that appear when it's on windowed on fullscreen, and again, this wouldn't be much of a problem if the ratio for it all wasn't something like 640x480, which makes it look... Weird in fullscreen. You're better off maximizing the window if you want the screen that big. I'm not going to insult the fact that there's no netplay for this, because there *kinda* is, which requires you to download a certain program which I have had no wish in wanting to try.This game is fun, it really is, and I love anime girls as much as the next guy (especially THESE ones.... Too bad the one I play is the loli character), but breaking it all down, the thing that destroys it all is trying to set this all up. If you have a Xbox 360 controller, go play Skullgirls or something else, because it's gonna be a pain in the neck for you to try and set up. Gameplay wise, I give this game an 8/10, this is definitely a cool game, from the animations to the different play styles, but as a Steam Game (meaning is it worth buying and everything), I'd have to give it a... 4/10. It pains me to say that because the game is definitely a fun experience, but still... I got it on sale for $2.49, and in the end, I feel it was a big waste of money.. Sorry, Vanguard Princess, I loves ya, however, there were too many faults to prevent me from enjoying you for more than the hour I played."
76561198047352573,Not Recommended,262150,13952519,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,GeminiDark,"I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to even my worst enemy. I'm sorry, but this is perhaps the worst 2d fighter I've ever played, and that's really diappointing. I really wanted this game to be good, I even got all the dlc so I could play it entirely from the start. But don't follow my footsteps. There are problems in every aspect of this game.There is no way to adjust or mute the sound. The plot and dialogue are mediocre at best, a generic plot with a dues ex machina that only really differs in one dialgue and the very ending.If you go into vs against a standstill enemy, and master the moves, then SOME of the following can be bypassed. But not much.Gameplay:The gameplay can be broken down into three things. The AI, balance, and controls. All three are completely broken in this game.The AI will spam attacks constantly, and with the final boss this means no way to get in close to her. They each spam their specials and support, all of which have some way of being unstoppable. For example: There is a character who can deal 35% of your max health in one hit that has the range of the entire screen. There is another whose specials are all grabs that cannot be stopped mid-grab. The final boss' attacks are all at range, with the closest being just further than the melee-only character's heavy attack. The support lolis will stun you just long enough for the spamming AI to get a hit and stunlock you. This creates a fight that REQUIRES you to either button mash or spam your own move, both of which will fail unless you also get very lucky.There is no balance whatsoever. As I stated above, there is a character with a max range attack that deals 35% of full health per hit, and has to be ducked to dodge. The final boss has the exact same attack, and so many attacks that can hit you no matter where you are that she can combo you in three hits to kill you right when the match starts. That character's AI will spam it quite often, locking you in place. The grab character will complete the grab whether you attack her halfway through or not. Any attack hitting her will just trigger it. The final boss will spam ranged attacks and her support to the point where even standing up is near impossible.The following is what can be bypassed by vs mode.The controls are the ultimate sin of this game's gameplay. The AI and unbalance could be bypassed if it were actually possible to play well. But the controls are set so that you have a light, middle, and heavy attack buttons, as well as a parry button and a support button. There is also a button that is literally set as the ""no action"" button. Meaning yes, there is a button that's sole purpose is to do nothing. This would be fine, except that hitting combinations of the light and middle attack buttons will trigger the parry, despite there being a button specifically for that. Given how difficult it is to avoid the AI's broken attacks long enough to actually attack, making a really easy mistake and wasting an opening with a parry will lose you the match very easily. Add to that how the controls for super moves and specials don't read quite right (though this could admittedly be my keyboard's fault) and the result is a necessity for spamming a single special move just to stand a chance of surviving.The control explanations are useless, as they call the buttons A, B, C, and X, yet when setting controls it doesn't say which each button equates to. It simply tells you what the button does, but not if it's meant to serve as A, B, C, X, or anything else. In other words, using any special whatsoever requires a lot of trial and error just to figure out, and in the middle of being stunlocked by the AI, that's very difficult.In the end, you'll end up finding a special for each character and just learning the timing for each character's standing up so you can spam it without them being able to get you into a stunlock yourself.Hopefully this game will get a major overhaul and balancing, but unless it does, don't buy it unless it's on a really good sale.I really hate giving negative reviews to anything, but this game needed one. I'm sorry."

I rarely write reviews but I am so frustrated that I have to so here goes... (In order of how I discovered things) and I will mention I use a PlayStation controller with the program DS3 Tool to emulate an Xbox controller but I will use Xbox terms just keep in mind the position of the Left Joy Stick and D-Pad.I looked at the art of this game and was rather thrilled, it looked fun, I enjoy fighting games and an anime style fighting game excited me, just like Skullgirls (which a enjoy very much, despite my amazing ability of completly sucking at it) What I did not know when buying this game was how much it lacked...I installed the game, started it up, first thing I noticed, windowed mode, okay, time to full screen... nope just leave it windowed, in full screen you have the same window just surrounded by an enormous black border which is just ugly especially on bigger screens like my 32in monitor. So I stayed in windowed mode.Next I'm using an Xbox controller... A is usually confirm while B is usually back... nope every button seems to be confirm and within 30 seconds of starting the game I was in a fight.. I didnt even get to look at the roster ""sad face"" or see other options or modes for that matter.Okay, so now I'm in a fight with a character fighting another character whose names I don't even know because ""Oh right, I didnt get to see the roster"" the opponet is the same fighter great, which one is me? ""Ummmmmm push the same button and watch which one repeats the same move?!"" Yeah lets do that. okay so I figure out which character is mine and I lost track of her a lot.Okay so now I have a general idea of who my fighter is now I'm trying to combo, nope, apparently not... yaaaaay button mashing... I started pushing the same button ""A"" to do a low kick the whole time... in the process I decided to diddle on Tumblr and message a few friends on my phone in the process... Oh hey I'm winning... now I focus on the game after I'm done on my phone... Oh hey I'm losing, pfft Sad I do better when I'm not paying attention, at the same time I couldn't tell if I was winning or losing since I didn't know who I was...Now I discover that the D-pad don't move me, but the Joy Stick... okay that's weird for a fighting game, usually I can use either, and I prefer the D-pad... guess that's not happening!By this time I am frustrated so I press Start, apparently that means Quit: Yes or No? by this time I understand that the Left Stick moves the cursor too... so stop for a second and check out the little Windows Bar at the top and discover that's how you change stage and all the other options (like button mapping which still didn't tell me what the buttons did) instead of it being in the game. Going on, I select ""No""I discovered only two game modes, Arcade and a Local Versus, not even a tutorial.This game feels like something that could be described as ""Pre-Alpha"" in yet it isn't even Early AccessSo please keep in mind 4 minutes of game time when I posted this and I wrote this, I feel like most of the ""Positive Reviews"" is just sarcasm, when there is so many better fighting games. (By the way Steam told me I had to play for at least 5 minutes so I started the game back up for 60 seconds just to post this review).This game will now gather virtual dust in my Steam Library.To the developers, I'm sorry if I seem very bashful. You made something I probably couldn't, not from scratch anyways, and if this is a first attempt, you have the basic mechanics down and you deserve props. But compared to games like Tekken, Dragonball Z, Street Fighter, Soul Caliber, Dead or Alive, and many others.... this severely lacks. I hope it gets some huge greatly needed updates.

,Not Recommended,262150,9916077,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,eradose,"I'm having a very hard time recommending this game.  There are good mechanics here, and the sprite work is top notch, but...The game's controls are counter intuitive.  On the keyboard, the arrow keys are not the default movement for Player 1.  Instead it's T, F, H, and B, which are not only a bit spaced out, but too close to the attack keys.  Using an Xbox 360 controler is also a pain, requiring you to completly rework the default controls.  Hell, by default, there's not a single button that will pause the game.  Not to mention you need third party software to even use the D-Pad (or a PS3 controller, which many recommend).  Also, it dose not bode well if the most effective tactic is button mashing (at least on a keyboard).UPDATE: I tried using a Hori brand arcade stick (the one included with Tekken 6), and though the buttons worked, the joystick would not.  And before you ask, YES I did test it on another game (AVGN Adventures), and can confirm that the joystick works just fine, meaning that it's the same issue as the D-pad.Another problem is the difficulty.  I've played many hard fighting games before, but a good chunk of the time I can't even beat the first opponent on Story Mode, ON EASY!  This game is unforgiving to anyone new to the game, and will kick your♥♥♥♥♥unless you learn how to use your character, or just get by by dumb luck.There's also no apparent VS CPU mode in the game, or even a training mode to help you practice (which it could really use).  It also dosen't help that the only way to get to the game's options is when it's in windowed mode.  In full screen mode, you cannot access the game's options, making it very hard to even quit the game at times (first time playing this on full screen, the only way I could quit the game was to use ctrl+alt+delete).I also want to bring up the graphics.  I have a high resolution screen, and the games speed is good, but the graphics look like I'm playing it on an early PS1 or Saturn at times (if not just a step below that).  It may be just my system, or it could be that the game isn't optimized for high resolution screens.  Until I can confirm what the problem is, I have to say it's a ""results may vary"" situation here.UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it is indeed a resolution issue.  Not game breaking, but it will hurt the game for some players.The lack of a net code dose hurt it a bit, but this is a problem being work on, so I cannot fault the game for that, not to mention that don't play games like this online enough for it to be a real problem for me.Compared to games like Skullgirls, BlazBlue, or Arcana Heart, there is some good mechanics, but the interface, controls, and difficulty in it's current form makes this hard for me to reccomend.  Should these things be fixed, I would say it's worth the $5, but as it is, I say wait until the game is patched to fix these problems.  When it dose, I will revisit this review"

The characters are well drawn and the voice acting is splendid. It is crazy fast-paced and runs smoothly.

Vanguard Princess does not have a fine line - it is purely frustration.For starters, there is no training/practice mode.  So unless you are a rabid hardcore fighting game nerd, the fighting is trial by fire (and in a very unrerwarding way).  The controls leave much to be desired as they are not as tight as I would like them to be - but sometimes you can work it (if the game feels generous).  I am still trying to figure out where the ""solid"" gameplay the promo mentioned is.Lastly, any of the fun you might have playing Vanguard Princess will evapourate as soon as you reach the end boss.  Hilda Rize is so insanely OP she can easly destroy 1/3 of your health with a single attack.  Her favourite tactic is to simply throw/knock you  to the other side of the screen and use overblown AoE attacks to annihilate you as you try to get close enough to her to hit her (this must be the ""global hit"" the promo referred to).  Of course, these attacks will knock you back to the opposite end of the screen each time they connect.  So you need to get close to her when the ""announcer"" is saying ""Ready, Go!"" if you want to avoid Hilda scoring a ""Perfect"" on you.Don't bother with this game - it may only cost $5 but there are MUCH better fighters out there to choose from."

If even half of these are implamented then I feel that the game would become at least 10x better.  Also by makeing some improvements I feel that you could of made a better indiegogo campaign (which I missed)1) my first problem is that to view all options you'd have to be in window screen instead of full screen mode to to view the ""Windows, Options, and Help"" tab.  They should be place as part of the main menu screen.  Along with being able to acess them when you pause the game.2) the whole press ""start+a+b+x+y"" to quit needs to be replace with a quit the game to a simple pause menu (like stated before) with a selectable option to end the game.3) The main menu screen should have a training room/practice mode instead of haveing to puase the game and do it manually.4) a suggestion for the ""Directors cut ""DLC how about including something like directors cut at the title screen5) It needs a move list that you can bring up during a match to see all of your characters moves.6) the keyboard controlls, what where you thinking.  I know that we can rebind the keys but come on those default controlls are rediculous.  I'm glade that I use a 360 controller.overall I rate this game a 6/10 but needs a lot of improvements to hardness a larger fanbase like SkullGirls."

With the new controller updates, the game is fairly enjoyable, there is a decent fighting game under the flaws and poor presentation. If this had the polish of say Skullgirls (as an example) I'd have to try and figure out how to play this one handed. I'm still a rampaging pervert.Older review text:Opens in a window with crap resoultion, looks like a SNES port. Menu interface is clunky, messy and hard to use. Some backgroundss over busy. Little to none information on moves, no training mode, limited gameplay options and no online play. Hard to tell sometimes who is who with 4 players on screen (you vs them, plus each have a companion) Feels cheap and nasty. I wonder why the hell this is even on Steam.Why do I then recommend this?Because I am a colossal pervertPlease dont hate me."

There are no real settings to speak of, so even if the game would have an ok artstyle, the resolution is crap. You can't adjust sound levels, so you are basically stuck with the bgm.I gotta say that the most of the animations are pretty fluid, and the artstyle is surprisingly good. Sure, it's a total boobfest, but credit where credit is due. The game runs well too, so there's that.But other than that, I feel like it's a total mess. At least a single stage is a complete mess where the characters actually blend into the background so badly that you can't easily figure out who's who and what' s what. The controls are ok, but I've experienced better. The game isn't an airdasher, more like a mix of old school streetfighter and some more anime concepts, like unique resources for each character. There's promise here that's obscured by sloppy design.I can't give a thumbs up to a game that lacks almost EVERY feature that we've come to expect from modern fighting games. It bare has a movelist and definitely has nothing like frame data, practise mode, tutorial, cutscenes, actual options menu, netplay, stats, customization...well, nothing but single player arcade and vs.Save your money, get something else."

Couldn't get my XBox 360 PC controller to work so I had to dig up one of my ancient logitech controllers to play the game. Keyboard controlls are available but I would not reccomend them. No training mode or tutorial that is easily accesible. Have to go into versus and push some button on the 2nd player controller to activate it or something along those lines. Couldn't actually do it myself. Game is hard to follow with the supports staying on the screen right beside or inside your character at all times. Seems that every character has the exact same control set up which means having your basic combos be Z techs which are impossible with the keyboard. Menu is very basic. This game definitely needs more work. If it was just a beta it'd be okay but there is a lot that this game seems to lack.

That's the only change apparently and I highly believe that because aside from the good graphics, the game is barebone when it comes to options or rather there are no options at all. You only have a Story and VS-mode. There are no actual options for the game and in order to get to the training-mode, you have to pull off some really annoying stuff which requires you to have two gamepads connected to your PC. Why is that a thing?!The game really comes of as a product that is suppose to be free, but you paid money for it regardless. Despite the decent graphics, the developer made no effort to justify the price tag. The english translation is no justification at all, because the game is so basic with it's menu and controls, you would easily understand everything despite the japanese language.In my opinion.If there really isn't any change to the freeware version aside the translation.

Second -  Steam Interface is not working, so you won't even be able to take screenshots, at least not in the standart way (F12). Full controller support ?! Really ?!

You can play in its original microscopic window, or try pulling the window larger from the sides either selecting to play in full screen, which in any case will screw the aspect ratio. There are only 2 options in the main menu: story mode & VS mode. No tutorial, no option menu, no training mode, and again - no exit button?! The plot in story mode is overwhelmingly boring. Fortunately you can at least skip it. Even if you have enough patience to get over all this - i doubt you'll have any left after discovering how imbalanced the characters & AI are.

However, this game was so unpolished that I didn't think it was worth the 4 bucks I spent on it. The game starts as expected with a small intro giving the characters a reason to fight. There are two basic modes to this game Story and Versus. There is also a Practice mode hidden within versus but in order to activate it the 2nd player must press the ""do nothing"" button (p). Although you can pause in versus and story mode you will not see a move list until you enter story mode, and only when you are choosing your characters. I played with every character and every assist character in versus before going into story mode. All the characters provide the stereotypical style mix of sorcery, martial arts, and gun play. None of this is outside of what I had expected. What I didn't expect to find is that the only method for changing your control scheme is outside of your game in the options tab of the window. There you will also find the stage select, number of rounds, and timer for versus. There are seven stages and you can have from 1 to 9 rounds. Now the timer can be set all the way up to 99 on a sliding bar, so even in practice mode there is no infinite round.The battles themselves present a unique idea. The two main girls fight agiainst one another, building up momentum to unleach super attacks. While those two girls fight they are each being followed by a girl who assists them with various abilities. These abilities are restriced to an energy bar that slowly builds up during the match. The assist characters may only be used if the main character is standing on the ground and actively in combat with the other. Which means you cannot be jumping or more than arms length from the other character. There is also no way of being able to tell what attack exactly the assist character will unleash until you have learned their various moves. Even still there is no way of directly controling them except sometimes it seems the movements of your main will affect how your assist will attack. I did find that sometimes having 4 characters on screen did make me lose track of my main character. This problem is made even worse when you find yourself in battle with assist character Hilda. Hilda doesn't move herself but summons two very large dolls to deal attacks for her. When I had made it to the final boss I had 5 - 7 girls on screen at one time. Needless to say I was suprised to see that I had one that fight.I would be remiss if I forgot to talk about the story mode. Everything is pretty standard. Start at the beginning and fight through girls until you reach the final boss. I was playing for speed so I played on easy with two rounds. Here you can see the greatest weakness of the game shine. The girls are severely unbalanced. Lilth the smallest fighter is by far the biggest challenge as she guards against most attacks and uses her grabs to interupt the rest. Even fighting her in the first stage was more of a challenge than it should of been. All the AI girls are quicker and spam the same moves during your battles. One of the others Kaede who is one of my favorites has 2 of her attacks all with the same input stream, so I never know which one I end up with. All the attack streams are very similar, which is nice. This game delivers on most of what I had expected from it, cheap thrills for fans of anime girls and combat games. It is a good example of a unique idea. However with so much wrong with the interface and AI that this game seems more like a beta than a finished product."

This game has some difficulty but its the type of dificulty that is fun and also challenging.The game is really short. A experienced fighter can probably clear the story in about 10 minutes. But the amount of fighters and the increasing difficulty can make for a new experience everytime you decide to play.The local multiplayer can be a blast if both of the players have played at least a little.The only problem I have with this game is if you do not have a controller to play the game with, It is rediculously hard to even play. The specials require direction inputs that is rediculously hard for a person playing with a keyboard can do.I loved the game and would reccomend it to people who enjoy fighter games and anime.

The buttons are wonkey and clunky. They don't make much sense when compared to most other fighting games. Worst of all it comits the worst sins of the worst anime fighters. The animations are pretty good. The backgrounds are decent. It has no sound controls what so ever(or much else at all for that matter). It only has 2 modes. That is a huge no no in a fighting game you want to charge for especially a game like this that wants to ""reinvent"" the fighting game control scheme. you get way more out of the free version of dead or alive and killer instinct. luckily for me I got the game for 2 bucks. I would not have wanted to pay any more for something like this. If it is indie get that it is indie but even then skull girls is a god send compared to this. It has potential. I hope the developers take more time studying more fighting games and what makes them as good as they are before making another one of their own. It isn't the worst fighting game I have ever played but it could use alot of work."

I was hoping for a smooth, fluid 2D shooter in the vein of Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, Type|Moon etc, but instead received a very unpolished product that barely runs on my system.Issues:* Game runs at 800x600 resolution. You can edit the graphics settings in the .ini file, but base assets are at an unacceptably low resolution for anything made in the past 10 years.* Game is exceedingly slow and laggy on my quad core i5 system with a GTX 1070. I'm talking sub-20 fps here.* Game crashes whenever I have my Xinput (nvidia Shield controller) device plugged in* Keyboard input is also very slow and unresponsive, not taking in quarter circle inputs or anything more complicated than basic movement/attack* Refund options do not include DLC purchase price (buyer beware)* Controls and navigation are poorly implemented for keyboard usersThe character designs are nice and colorful, and the combat system /might/ be good for all I know, but I am unable to enter any advanced moves because of the above input issues I am facing, so I am left with a broken product that I can't refund for anything close to what I shelled out for.Regretfully, I will have to rate this game a ""No""."

In combat, you have to choose the direction of attack and movement, and the type of attack (Weak, Normal, Strong).Character selection screen needs some work, as you can't get a really good feel for the interpersonal relationships between the primary fighter and her assistant character.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys pressing the attack key quite often.

,Not Recommended,262150,29736682,Posted: 5 February,all,Lizard Robot,"Nice graphics, but very low resolution for modern systems. At 1:1 resolution the game is only 3"" wide on my screen. Making it bigger gets very pixely and doesn't necessarily preserve aspect ratio. The game needs much better resolution upsizing support. (I play plenty of pixel-style games, Starbound particularly, so this isn't inherently a shortcoming of using pixel graphics.)Vanguard Princess is also clearly meant for controller play more than keyboard. Triggering specials with the keyboard is hard to do consistently, but looks like on a controller, it would just be a quick roll of the joystick. Plus, the default keyboard keys are abysmal.The keyboard controls being so tricky makes the game get kind of button mashy and my wrists hurt after just a few minutes of frantically trying to trigger specials on most characters, with one GIANT exception. I was able to pull off Kaede's Flying Wall Assault successfully, because that combo doesn't involve any controller rolls/diagonals. More than that, I was able to pull it off -continuously- by just mashing the strong attack and down keys repeatedly and never doing anything else, enabling me to beat the entire game without losing a single battle. Half the time, I won battles without taking any damage in normal and hard mode, most notably the final boss battle -- I beat the boss without getting hit in either round in normal mode, and I took two hits total in hard mode.Mysteriously, two different moves on Kaede have the same trigger sequence listed. (Thunderclap Claw and Round Moon Kick.)The game reset to the start screen during a playthrough. It also crashed out twice, once when just idling in the background for trading card drops.I do like the character designs a lot, and the animations are well done.The story cut scenes were a little frustrating because I wanted the text to go by faster, but hitting a button just skipped the story entirely. Turns out not to be a great loss. The story is a bit flimsy and the translation/writing isn't that great.On the bright side, I got my card drops and finished the game's story mode on all difficulty settings, so I marked it as ""all done"" in my collection and uninstalled."
