So I have seen the entire game, with that said this game is pretty bad.  However there are three things I feel people should know about before even considering this game.THERES NO ENDING!This seriously ticks me off! The game literally has no ending it just cuts off. The game even goes as far as to tell you they ran out of funs while your playing the game. but guess what? NO WHERE on the store page does it tell me this game is unfinished…Poor ControlsController buttons are not labeled properly during gameplay. Why is this a problem? Because this game had the wonderful idea of adding parts to the game where you must hit the proper buttons Quickly in the right order at certain parts or die instantly in most cases.  Telling me to hit joystick 1 for X button then expecting me to do it within 1 second  is annoying, even more so when there are very high penalties for messing up, (usually death). Another issue with controls that if you plan on using a controller be ready to feel frustratedDrink or dieYep you must constantly drink if you forget to or run out you will get game over. I should note there is plenty of beer throughout the entire game and you should almost never run out. So why is it a issue? It drains FAST and becomes annoying while you are in combat plan and simple. Having to worry about the gauge while I’m trying to focus on fighting (which is pretty low grade as well) is tedious.Bottom line I wish the DEVS spent less time and money on developing breast physics, and more time actually finishing or fine tuning a game. at any rate if a game with no ending, and unpolished gameplay is a problem for you stay clear.P.S. I will note I was harsher due to there being no ending(and no warning about it..) if the devs go back and add one I will update my review but there are many other issues to be address to, The down side is the idea seemed interesting it was just executed poorly."

What we have here is a charming little game with some major issuesThe Pros:- Art Style - I like the look of this game, for some reason the beetlejuice cartoon comes to mind, although I could be very wrong with that comparison- The Soundtrack - great music, even if some of the tracks feel misplaced in certain sections.- Drunk poopy humor - stupid humor that isn't all that funny, but amusing. Although the second to last cutscene in the game was extremely funny, anyone who has played this knows what im talking about .- well placed videogame/film pop culture references - by far my favorite part of this game. very tastefully done .The Cons:The Gameplay - I cant really say I had much fun playing this game. It felt clunky, the melee combat is awful, and 2-3 weapons you have are really boring. the only time i had remotely any fun was when some cool music would kick in during a section, but it would abruptly end in an awkward way- XBOX360 CONTROLLER PROMPTS FOR INGAME QUICK TIME EVENTS - THE BUTTONS SHOW UP AS ""JOYSTICK BUTTON 0"" OR ""JOYSTICK BUTTON 2"" FOR THE QUICK TIME EVENTS!!! WHAT!?!?!? HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN IN 2015 WHERE A 5 YEAR OLD GAME LIKE AMNESIA ACTUALLY SHOWS IT AS ""A"" OR ""X"" FOR THE INGAME PROMPTS . THIS REQUIRED TRIAL AND ERROR FOR THE QUICK TIME SCENES WHICH IS UNFAIR AND THE MOST♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥OFF I HAVE BEEN PLAYING A GAME IN A LONG TIME.- drinking zombeer throughout the came became repetitive and boring. I would have liked a brief explanation of how the protagonist gotten bit. I know a game like this doesn't require an in depth story, but it just seemed stupid- worst end arena boss battle ever - Every round ended with a quick time event, and if you died in the last round you had to start at the beginning of the arena battle, I felt that was unfair for a game like this , for it required you to wait around to do the same boring quick time events- Quick Time Events in general, completely pointless. You can mow down zombies and beat em up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥  face to face, but one single zombie runs at you from down the hall and you have to run into a room via quick time event  and if you fail it he kills you? again why its so pointlessThe hardest part of writing this review is deciding whether to give this game a thumbs up or down. even as i was writing this I still hadn't decided which one to choice. With all this said, I have a hard time recommending this game. I did enjoy many aspects of Zombeer, but I didn't really have much fun playing the game, and having fun is kind of an important aspect. I give it a 5/10. Its not a bad game, not a great game."

,Recommended,262190,14257770,"Posted: 31 January, 2015",all,Kaibamon,"Well I finished it...in around two and a half hours. Think I will play it again! 7/10Overview: Right off the bat looking at the Steam store screenshots you can guess this is a parody game of most zombie titles out there, and of course it has a lot of references and fan pandering (big zombie boobies). But that’s not really a bad thing. All the jokes are done right and are within moderation, some made me giggle or go like “ Aaah I get it!”. So for those two and a half hours I had fun.Graphics: Well this is no Cry or Unreal 4 engine game but it is well done. It has its own unique style that makes it stand out. Performance wise it’s not that pretentious so it will run on lower-mid range pcsAnimation could have been improved, zombies look a bit clunky when they are moving, at least the normal ones. The cheerleading or dancing ones are quite well animated.Textures are not 1080p but you won’t be bothered since the game has such a wacky style to it.Game play: This is where it falls short. Again, this is more of a parody game so probably more time was put into everything else.  Weapon wise you got four that look cool but are generic.  They don’t feel like they carry any weight to them or in some cases are just frustrating to use. Like the Zomgrenades, it has one of the worst throw mechanics ever.Despite that, the guns do their job. A shame you could not upgrade em at least, to spice things up.You character’s health is also somewhat hard to guess since the only indication that you are injured is the generic shooter blood splatter that appears around your screen, I guess you can take up to five hits. The lower bar zombie-drunk mechanic is actually amusing for this amount of time. And I found out sometimes it can be in your advantage if you go zombie a bit.Sound: Well it is more or less lacking, you will go from place to place and just hear K rant as he chugs down a beer. Only in certain areas where there is a crowd of zombies or some zombie cheerleaders do you get some music. And a shame, the soundtrack is quite nice and for the length it could have been appropriate to listen to it.Conclusion: It is an ok game for this price. There are games out there that charge you more for even less, but with this one for the couple of hours amusement and a small replayability chance it is ok. Could have been better, maybe could have had co-op or mp integrated. Or maybe even a workshop. But who knows. I say get it if you have some spare cash lying round and if you are bored one day or weekend."

,Recommended,262190,14239820,"Posted: 30 January, 2015",all,Tony Bamanaboni,"- Super Edited! -After playing the game some more, I think that thanks to the updates that have been put into the game from the developers has actually made the game more enjoyable.Gameplay can get pretty repetitive after a while and the graphics aren't going to wow you in anyway but for a game that really was just a port from the PS3, it's not all that bad. It's got a sort of Postal charm to it after a while and the gameplay though repetitive can be pretty fun in so stages were you get a new weapon.AI is pretty dumb though, I know they are Zombies but they are dumb as bricks but it adds some charm to the games overall appeal. The models are pretty strange as well, and jiggly zombie boobs... that's all I'm going to say about this one.The humour of the game is sadly where I'm going to fault this game, it's pretty bland and it's pretty obvious what the joke is and it ends up coming out as stail. The Simpsons joke in the game was okay but really wasn't hilarious.Thanks you to the developers for being kind for a change instead of denying criticism like most modern ""indie devs"" now a days. You guys seem to take it to heart and actually really enjoy making games and I have to say that I was a bit angry before but playing the game over again, it's not a bad game, it's very good but I'd have to say some of the flaws do hold it back.7.5/10Good game, even though it has some flaws."
,Recommended,262190,16242318,"Posted: 7 June, 2015",all,Harley,"There are many routes a zombie game can take, and I feel it safe to say that now that we’ve had Dying Light bring parkour to the party, we’ve pretty much explored them all. So what is a small game to do to set itself apart in such an oversaturated genre filled with countless tropes? Pander. Pander to all of it! One look at the launch trailer on Steam will highlight just what I mean, as it’s an unfolding-in-reverse, silly animation, animal-eared, jiggly-titted spoof of the critically acclaimed Dead Island intro. If this unabashed homagery wears thin on you, you won’t be any more enthused to hear that the intro video has you coming to at a bar with “No Fate” scrawled into it, there’s an Apocalypse Now reference, and a mention of someone named Colon Duty, and your first weapon is a vibrator. Yeah. Yeeeaahhhh… It should be pretty clear by now that Zombeer isn’t going to be where you’ll go to find a high-brow, refreshing take on the shooter genre. Instead, developers Moonbite Games and PadaOne Games have opted to take everything ridiculous and overplayed and revel in it.Zombeer 2015-02-02 19-57-35-98The game suffers an obvious lack of polish, which I would expect, given a team of just a few people, but what I keep coming back to is that the game’s core mechanic, having to drink Zombeer to fight the infection.  It feels like some sort of forced side scrolling mechanic in a first-person game that serves no purpose other than to push you forward at the pace the game has decided for you. This mechanic has its moments, as failing to drink enough Zombeer causes you to transform for a short time before dying, allowing you to slip unnoticed past zombies, but it feels like more of a burden than a feature, if I’m frank.The million dollar question is whether or not Zombeer is worth your ten dollars and time. I suppose that would make it a ten dollar question, but that doesn’t have quite the same ring. I like Zombeer. Sure, I’m irked by the shameless port from console without any  attention to the things we expect on PC, like the ability to disable input acceleration and smoothing, but really, that didn’t ruin the experience for me. It feels painfully short, and the creative weapons made me really expect more exploration into what the creators could have offered me, but I found myself really enjoying the romp down pop-culture lane. Even the game’s conclusion, which is a choice between three arbitrary endings that seem to have nothing to do with the story, leaving the entire game disappointingly without conclusion is a great nod and jab at Mass Effect. Oh, and the puzzle box ending made me happy in a way that few games in recent memory have.zombeerinsert3Think of Zombeer like the videogame equivalent to a night of movie watching after a rummage in a discount DVD bin. Sure, Zombeer is rough around the edges and it certainly can’t cut it with the big boys, but critically, it seems to know this. Zombeer is not afraid to be the videogame equivalent of a B movie. Even better, it’s proud to be. The sooner you can make peace with this fact, the sooner you can start to appreciate Zombeer for the fun little spend of time that it is.8/10Zombeer is not afraid to be the videogame equivalent of a B movie."

It looks nice, and even despite the short length the areas are quite varied.  There are tons of pop references.  It's not hilarious, but it is a comical game overall.If you're looking for a long game, look elsewhere.  This clocks in around 2-3 hours if you explore everything.

Out of all these years I've never had a game so bad that I've honestly felt I have wasted my money on it and have never refunded one of them, and I brought ""Duke Nukem Forever""! But this is the first and most likely the only game I'll ever refund.

Much like Guillermo Vargas's starving dog, it deprives us of entertainment, laughter, leaves no room for the mind to wander, forcing us to stare not into it's depravity, but our depravity. Our complacency with the abusive and animalistic  behavior of modern society is mirrored perfectly in the protagonist.His alcohol dependency and the nonsensical rampage fueled by it causes us to look inward, towards our own childhoods at the hands of an abusive father, and our own actions, the endless cycle of suffering we inflict upon our children.The bikini clad zombies, and the drive to crush their skulls with a rubber phallus perfectly mirrors the father's uninhibited sexual drive. The bikini clad zombies, the women, as only the child could see them, ever consuming flesh, ever consuming the desperately needed attention of the father.The fruitless, unending pursuit of the girlfriend, a child's need for a mother. Desperately, yet ineffectually grasping at a feminine presence to nurture him, shelter him from the harsh reality of the father's abuse.The constant bombardment of over used video game and movie references, a stab at education and the modern meme. The same nonsense regurgitated over and over again until it is finally accepted as correct. The very cornerstone of modern education, modern brainwashing at the hands of an indifferent system as can only be experienced by a child.And finally, the abrupt ending. A less than subtle reminder of our own masturbatory nature. Ever striving towards that next laugh, that next victim, in a quest for gratification of the ego, as ultimately fruitless as it may be."

I believe that the resulting product of this size, work and mentality is worth the $10 price.If you believe you have the skills to create a storyboard for a zombie parody game that showcases a coherent storyline with all the important elements, game mechanics that reduce the tedium. or think you can make better cartoon graphics, send your resume to MoonByte or Padaone.

Did I have fun watching undead/living boobies bounce around. Yes. Did I enjoy the random easter eggs found within the game? Yes. But thats about all I enjoyed.First off, this game is not finished, and the 1.8 hours I spent playing the game (or for that fact anyone would probably sspend without hunting down every colectible) is not worth $9.99. It's hard to justify that price for such little time. Would my story be diffrent if the game had more substance, more than likley so. But with 4 weapons, an health bar that continues to drain unless you drink beer, poor mechanics, and a lack luster story arc its hard to front the $9.99 when you can buy a much better game for cheaper.When/if this game is ever completed I might be singing a diffrent tune. I was generally excited for this game when I came accros it on the queue. But now I just feel teased in a sense, like this fun and wacky game was dangled in front of me and then it just vanished. But it fell into the trap of having to many basic features that other first person shooters have, and trying to cover it all with toilet hummor. But what can you expect with Zombeer. I feel like the develpoers had all thes great ideas about how to poke fun at other games while keeping the player interested with giant zombie breasts bouncing at you.I guess the raeson why im so bitter, is because there is no ending. Just a ""well hey buddy, good job on getting this far, we kind of dont have anything else for you here so...thanks for the $9.99."" And for those of you like me who like building badges, good luck completing the badge for this game, the cards are stupid expensive.If anyone reads this, please just wait on this game. I honestly dont know how this has a ""Very Positive"" user review base. I wish I would have looked more at the meta critic score.And to the developers, if you read this, finish your damn game. Or at least put it as early access, come on man. Not even a head up in game that this is all we get."

I kind of waited three year's to play this game, I Green lighted on Steam Greenlight way back then. It's not a Horrible game and It's not a Great game. The game is like a Love Letter to All type's of Movie's, Show's, Game's and Comic book's. The biggest Down side to the game is the Aiming System or Hit Detection: When trying to hit a zombie in the head with the Pink♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it's like ""Yeah Good Luck With That"" Cause I know I'm aiming at their head and I see the cross hair circle is where it need's to be to hit them in the head. With that said and Done I will say just play it on Easy or Normal, I did Normal cause I tired doing Hard but thats when I first notice the Hit-Aim is off that is when I went with Normal. I also picked up Zombeer for 20% off of $9.99 so all I paid was $7.99 I Do & I Don't Recommend Zombeer I went with Yes cause it's a Fun little game to play and their is no middle ground for Yes or No. Now down to business Zombeer is a 6 out of 10"
,Recommended,262190,16576054,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,Not One Of Us,"A short, entertaining, goofy little FPS.  That's... pretty much it, really.When I say short, I do mean short.  I finished it in under two hours, and I wasn't even trying to rush things.  I guess the developer log wasn't joking at the point when they said they ran out of money.The gameplay has very simplistic run-and-gun mechanics, yet somehow I found it more enjoyable than a lot of First Person Shooters released in the past decade.  Maybe it's because the game doesn't project any delusions of being anything more than it really is - a simple shooter with a theme, and that theme is booze, zombies, and zombie boobies.The game has a very fun and stylish art direction, and this team definitely has the potential to make a solid shooter.  I would love to see them try their hand at a fast-paced throwback shooter made for the PC.  Do it in this style while having tighter controls and mechanics and you'd really have something attention grabbing.As it is, Zombeer is worth about $5.  It means I overpaid, but oh well, it was still a fun romp."

,Recommended,262190,14299867,"Posted: 2 February, 2015",all,Rekyua,"Stupid, Dumb, FunI knew full well going into it that this game wasn't going to be the top echelon of video games and was already well prepared for the frat-movie comedy of video games and it didn't disappoint. The game pokes fun at itself and games in general in addition to movies. It's the Scary Movie of video games in appearance and humor.If you want something that will probably get you to laugh (but humor is subjective so who knows!) then the game should get you chuckling.However, it does have some problems you should know before you go in or make your choice.- Problems with Mouse acceleration, aiming right now is a problem as you have to use short slow motions or the camera will spin with reckless abandon. I use a trackball so I adjusted fine after a few minutes but I don't know how if its worse or better for tradional mouse users.- Repetivite audio, the game doesn't have many sound effects and when using a power-up the hero will let out a quip while you use it, which wouldn't be so bad since power-ups aren't a common constant right? That leads to the next con..- You have constantly depleting meter to babysit which can't get too empty or too full, if you do it's a game over. It wasn't so bad to manage but the face is you have to take a Zombeer to increase it and at the rate it depletes you'll do this every 30-60 seconds, which starts a uninterrupable 3 second animation and a quip from the protagonist. Which is why this and the last con go hand in hand and can really make the game feel stale fast.That aside, I enjoyed the game and found it fun and worth the buy. I only hope they finish the game because as of now, it's unfinished and ends with a cliffhanger of sorts (you beat the big bad but the game isn't actually over after that) so hopefully we'll see Zombeer concluded someday."
