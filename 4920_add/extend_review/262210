While I understand it is a mobile port, the added content, improved graphics, and friendly Dev all make it worth while.It is a nice casual game to pick up and play for 15-30 min during breaks.One thing to watch out for though is how often the screen shakes. It shakes a lot to simulate riding a horse. Something I found to counter this shaking is to actually ride a real horse while playing the game. Works great."

It´s not that kind of game that you play 3 hours at a time but it won´t get boring so fast. It´s a kind of game which provides some horse action in a funny way not in the girly way that riding games usually are.It has a story mode which you can play in different perspectives. An endless mode where you can rank up points unlock other characters and stuff and the third mode were you start from the castle and can make your way trough the area where ever you want to go. There are lots of different hats you can find for your characters and for the achievement hunters over 70 achievements to get.At this point I like to mention the great and fast support of the dev solving the few bugs that we/ I encountered =)I recommend this game if you are looking for some variety in your library - looking for a cheap game or just like smashing other knights off their horsies ^.^

Last Knight is a fantastic looking game, and could potentially be a even more fun if it weren't so frustrating at times. It definitely doesn't need more options, but the ones that are already present need some tightening before I'd consider this game to be anything more than a showpiece. In any case, the production values are top-notch, especially for a game that comes at a such low price. If this is the future of endless runner games, then sign me up, because I'm on my way to buy a new pair of running shoes."
76561198122163777,Recommended,262210,33707162,Posted: 21 July,all,Opal Knight,"This game is a smash, literally!Have you had a bad day and wished you could just run up and knock the heads off of your adversaries? Do you wish you could gracefully ride a horse at full speed leaping over fences and chasms with the greatest of ease?  Have you just returned from the Renaissance Faire, all pumped up, wishing you could have joined in on all that jousting goodness?  Well, you're in luck because whatever your secret desire is, this game can help you fullfill it!This is a Runner/Platformer game which has surprisingly fluid controls (I like playing with a controller best).  I never felt like I missed a hit or a jump because of sluggish-control reaction time or over-compensating turning controls.What is nice is that there are 3 points-of-view to choose from for playing the story campaign: slightly behind your character (normal viewpoint), first-person perspective, and bird's-eye view (both horizontal and vertical).  You may have found that there are fun platforming games but you just wished they had picked a different perspective because the current one just doesn't work well for you; well, they have included them all, so you can choose your pleasure.  And each perspective has it's own story progression and ranking, so if you have finished the game with all gold medals on the normal viewpoint, you can go ahead and try your hand at bird's-eye view and so on.  It's a simple addition which opens up all sorts of possibilities for different kinds of gamers, and one I wish was implemented in more titles.They also have an endless mode and a survival mode to play in addition to the story campaign, and a lot of customization options to unlock so there is actually a fair amount of content to play through, even if the basic gameplay style doesn't change all that much.  And that's a lot of content for a game of its price range.  If you're the type of person who likes to have a lot of objectives to knock off in a game, this title would be one for you.Unfortunately, all those objectives are not reflected well in their Steam achievements.  I would say the biggest negative for this game is that it has very poor Steam achievements (not really a deal-breaker for most).  When you have 77 possible achievements, and after 3 years less then 2% of your players have gotten half of those achievements, and barely 5% have even gotten a third, you know you aren't doing something right.  I'm not saying you need to hand out achievements left and right every time a player reads a sentence, but it would be nice to get some achievements for getting gold medals in levels and the like.  Most of the achievements are for doing some odd manuever that you aren't even able to control or track.  If you are a Steam achievement hunter, this title will be a bit of a disappointment in that area, but don't let that be the only reason not to get the game.  It is very fun and has a lot to do in it so it is definately worth its low price."

I really enjoy it.It's funny, the graphics are great in both landscaping and characters and the horses face is brilliant, makes me smile. The controls are responsive, physics are great.The sound of the environment effects, enemy and obstacle impact, the horse moving all fantastic.I love the way you pick up quests, you get the quest if you can ride through it. Each quest is for a specific character, which I think is another great thing, because it gives you a good motive to want to unlock the other characters.I really don't think there's anything about this game that I don't like.I love my free musketeer hat as well =) Haven't come across any of the others at all yet, but I read the drop rates for them are about to be improved (and new stuff added) so I look forward to that.There's a lot of different modes to play in as well. 3 are accessible straight way and the other modes you can unlock.There's power ups you can buy with gold as well.I'm normally a little wary of early access games but to be honest if this game is abandoned before completion (which I really don't think it will be) I'd be really sad, but there's enough game play and it's polished enough and I've had such fun playing what is available so far that I wouldn't regret that I bought it, or feel cheated in any way. So if buying in to an early access game is one of your concerns, it doesn't need to be with this game. (At the time of writing the game is only £4 anyway, I mention this because I know £4 can be a lot to some people, and for kids spending pocket money etc)My main concern watching the videos was that this game would give me motion sickness but even though the camera is bouncy I haven't had an issue with motion sickness playing this at all (I've only played in 3rd person so far). There's an option to switch off the bounce though if this does affect you (which imo all games should have a motion sickness friendly camera option), so a HUGE thumbs up for this as well since for a lot of us it means persevering with a game while feeling chronically ill or not playing a game at all and basically throwing your money away."

I've never been so terrified of donuts and cheeseburgers in my life. Also for those with fat and exploding fetishes.Oh and the game is pretty damn good too. The raising and lowering of the lance can be a bit wonky at time and aiming it favors the right side just a tad, but otherwise that aspect is pretty cool. I also don't really like that it's possible for enemies to spawn just behind jump only sections and make it very hard to land and lance almost simultaneously. Ragdoll physics can be pretty hilarious too.Overall yes I recommend it. It's very enjoyable and quite comical."

Made with Unreal Engine makes the game totally different from mobile ports of the same games in general. Let your knight speed up with his horse and hit your enemies away with the battle stick. Endless mode and the new world mode will make you more busy with the game since there its not dependent to the story.A have a compliant for the game and thats probably a bug or my pc has some issues i dont know but, there is an instant lag for the campaign when you are fighting the boss and it happens when you come very close to the dragon. At some places shorty before you will collide into the enemy the same lag happens again and its strange that it happens mostly at that moment."

Easy to pick up, hard to master. Wasn't really expecting much going into it if we're being honest, but I was surprised at the amount of content and the quality of the game in general. The jousting mechanic is extremely fun and is a major reason you'll keep coming back. When you defeat someone or are defeated, it'll do a cool slow-mo effect like when you die in GTA or a similar game. It's always fun to watch slow-mo ragdoll physics, especially with a horse involved this time. The game's cheap, pick it up and have some fun."

You have 5 buttons to use, of which you mostly use 4: left, right, attack, jump. That's it and when you get to the harder levels, you will be glad that there is nothing more to worry about. The game does have a cliché medieval atmosphere, but never takes itself seriously at all. The humor is fun if you are 6 years old, or if you sometimes long to be a 6 years old again.Don't expect too much from the campaign: it is just a kind of extended tutorial and hardly contains content that is not elsewhere in the game as well. The endless runner mode however is great. Graphics and controls are very well working together: the graphics give you a sense of motion and chaos, while the controls keep things structured for you. Very well executed.- The only thing I don't like about the game is that I always have to hear this annoying sound when I die, and always need to press a button to indicate that - no, thank you - I don't need to see myself die in slow-motion AGAIN. But this is just because I die so often ;)."

Two: for there to be some innovation in the gameplay structure. Last Knight does both. This game offers good challenge, a variety of characters and enviroments, a story mode, several variants on endless mode, and a randomly-generated roguelike mode. That's a lot of gameplay, and a major step forward compared to other endless runners.Of course, it is Early Access and, as such, a work in progress. There are some bugs, and the rogue-rider mode is incomplete. I'd like to see more characters added, maybe some that think outside of the medieval box, like a robot or a valkyrie. How about a centaur? It would also be nice if we could redefine the keys, although the default keymap works well. Other than that, I have no complaints about what I've purchased.In summary: Last Knight is currently my favorite game on the Mac. It's well worth the 5 bucks, and even more so when it's sale."

Shouldn't be listed as a mac compatible game when it's known to have major issues and is listed as full release.Update: Developer was quick to work with me and is trying to troubleshoot so I will vouch for their care about their customers.Update 2: Developer found a way to get the game sort of running on my machine. The gameplay is fun but I still wouldn't recomend it to Mac user with the amount of issues and poor performance on Mac. Hopefully a unreal engine (the engine they use to run the game) update that is supposedly coming down the pipe will fix the issues with Mac. In the meantime i'd recommend that Mac users stay away."
76561198040868056,Recommended,262210,29027030,Posted: 4 January,all,ZuTheSkunk,"The idea behind this game is simple: you are knight on a constantly running horse, and you have to either reach the end of the level (Story Mode), or just survive for as long as possible (Endless Mode) - all while collecting coins, defeating enemies, and avoiding obstacles.You can steer left and right, you can jump, and you can hit things with your spear. Thus, the gameplay is as simple as it gets, and the difficulty stems from whether you can react quickly enough to the obstacles in your path. It's definitely enjoyable in its simplicity, and it works quite nicely as something to play when you're looking for something simple and straightforward. It has a nice soundtrack, pretty nice graphics, and a decent sense of humor during the cutscenes; the levels are varied and they constantly require you to pay close attention to the incoming obstacles. It's overall a fun game to play, for the most part.I would have two complaints though: one would be that at times, the game seems to have a wonky collision detection, and you can end up falling off or down a platform youthoughtyou landed on just fine, or getting hit by an enemy youthoughtyou managed to hit with your spear. Devs really ought to fix that, because it's incredibly frustrating to die from what you could swear was not your fault at all.My other complaint would be the Knightmare levels. Basically, the idea behind them is pretty stupid: they are supposed to be a hard version of whatever world you're currently in, but the entire difficulty stems from the game intentionally messing with the visuals in a ""oh god I'm high as heck"" kind of way, which is a really cheap and unfair way of making a game more difficult. The cave Knightmare level deserves a special mention, being hideously unfair, being the prime example of the aforementioned wonky collision, and generally being THE level that will make you want to snap your gamepad if you'll try to go for a Gold medal.But overall, it's definitely a recommendable game, even if moments of ""That was NOT my fault, you a-holes!"" take away from the enjoyment a little."

Some of us are a bit over tablets and the pay to win rubbish and would rather play a good casual games on the couch with no strings attached. Graphic style, level themes, camera effects, slow-mo replays and music are all great in big picture. Controls on the XBox controller are tight.

I watched the alpha videos in early development, I voted for it on Greenlight and then anxiously awaited it's release.  I absolutely love the jousting platformer concept and I think the vibrant cartoonish graphics were an great stylistic choice that suit the game very well.  It's a solid concept, however it suffers from a common symptom that plagues the modern era of gaming: it simply isn't challenging enough.Last Knight has all of the right ingredients to make a fantasic game but falls short on just a few game mechanic choices. When the character is knocked from the horse you choose to continue from a check point or restart the stage. These retries are unlimited. You can do it over and over and over until you get it right.  If the game had the old  lives / continues system it would make the game much more appealing. You could have even used the coins collected in game to purchase extra lives, giving them more functionality than just adding to your score.So I am a little disappointed in some of the game mechanic choices but over all I'd still recommend giving Last Knight a go just for it's brilliant concept but maybe wait until it's on sale."

Even if the story mode itself is quite short, there is a ton of content and achievements to unlock, including Adventure mode, Endless mode with quests, powerups and characters, and so on. The replayability is just fantastic and I haven't checked all already but I was very impressed by the content I've seen so far.Please note that Last Knight is not one of these 3 lanes runner that we see today on mobiles (like Temple Run or Subway Riders), instead here you have to strafe precisly to avoid the obstacles and aim your enemies with your spear. One great point about this is that the collisions are remarkably precise, it brings a lot to the gameplay.Another good point is also the humoristic characters and animations that you have all along the game (check the trailer). If you like this kind of style you won't be disappointed. The sound design (music and fx) is of great quality too.Technically the game runs with the Unreal Engine 3, that means that it will run at full fps on today configurations.

This doesn't look like Crash Bandicoot, Super Mario or Ratchet and Clank at all, in any way. It's a digrace to say this title looks like these awesome games that I grew up with and have all played. This is NOT a platformer, it seems to me like it's just an endless runner for mobile devices with a microtransaction system, that was just removed for the PC edition and compensated by making the game more expensive for PC. I don't even know why there's so many positive reviews for this game? The menu is hard to understand and the sounds are lacking and of bad quality. The only pros for this game is the cartoony graphics, thanks to the Unreal Engine, which look quite good and the lack of a microtransaction system (thank god). Do not waste money on this game, maybe it's fun as a free download for your mobile device, but definitely not for a PC game.

Your knight chugs along a narrow corridor at a decent pace, jumping and lancing obstacles in his way. The graphics are very nice and the pallet choice is easy on the eyes. There's a lot of little details the designers put in the game. One that actually made me say ""Oh Wow!"" out loud was during the cutscenes. Between each level is a frame showing a scene; usually your knight and whomever he is talking to. The player can use his or her mouse or controller to tilt the frame in various directions creating a 3D effect. It's a really cool feature. I'd recommend this game to anyone. You'd have to be pretty jaded to not find any sort of entertainment here."

Sure it's fun but what's the point if a free mobile game can provide same or better experience?This game isn't very hard but you're going to die a lot while learning to face new enemies and memorizing each level. The worst thing about it is you have to watch lengthy death animation and loading screen everytime you die.

While visually it may be it was hug dissapointment to find out that its just a port of typical mobile phone runner. Well i must admit its a nises runner i ever player but it is just like 90% of moder cell phone games are only playable in toiler ot on a way, to kill time, on PC i dont feel like enjoy playing such kind of game.So on cell phone its nice when you sit in toilet, graphics nice even on PC, vert adorable, bug linear repetive gameplay, typical convoluted cell phone UI with ugly hacked int kyeboard and gameplay supportm and wrong expectations to see crash bandicoot kind of game are reasons why i would not recommend to buy it on pc, you can do that on your dumbphone,Well, maybe if you have kid this game would be suitable on PC, but for more or less adult person there is absolutelty bo gameplay value.Also cutscenes fadin effefct after each line of character annoys me.I wish dev of this game instead of porting game as is just would use its assets and make a true crash bandicoot like game with free 3d gameplay."

The graphics are nice, but a bit laggy on my mid-level mac. I think this is due the 3D engine that is used, and the pre-rendering of the maps. I can play much more ambitiously designed games on my computer without such a drop in framerate.Game play is very simple and repetitive, but challenging enough to be fun, if you enjoy runners. Some of the challenges are bit cheap, and it seems to be due to poor design, rather than intent. But, if you enjoy this kind of game, it really is quite amusing.Now...Things that annoy me:Graveyards frequently have a big sign blocking the player from seeing an obstacle that one must dodge or jump over upon entering. I got used to this. This is the one I'd call 'cheap'.When one jousts, the action slows down to show the hit but it really throws off of the rhythm of the game. The character runs at a consistent clip throught the game, and (at least, I) tend to look in front of the character to get the timing right. But, I frequently end up running into something right after hitting a spider or a  horseman, because the game has slowed to show the action of the impact, like I'm in the matrix, or something. Wow, I really hate this. I wish they'd give an option to disable it.I am STILL not used to the controls, as simple as they are, and must remap them each time I play, since they don't save keymaps, and the default keymap is counterintuitive. I invert it so that jump is the left mouse, and joust is right, as the knight has his jousting... uh, thingie(?) in his right hand. It seems weird to press the left button to get him to use the weapon in his right hand. Am I wrong to find that odd?So, ALL of that nonsense aside, the game is pretty fun. I like seeing the horse and the knight tumble over themselves when they fall... That part is pretty funny. It's fun to get in the groove and play for 5 or 10 minutes at a time. I'd recommend buying it on sale."
