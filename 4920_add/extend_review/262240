(I learned this the hard way). Suguri is a fast paced action shooter, kept my heart beating a lot faster than your average horror game.Pros-I found this unique, there were an arsenal of many weapons with different kinds of tactics to put into use.-The dash ability was a very crucial yet fun way to progress through the game.-Game is very fast paced, there won't be a time when your body is relaxed (except when you're talking the bosses). It really keeps the excitement in the game-1st stage soundtrack was the best c:Cons-There wasn't any tutorial, nor any guide to tell you that dashing can dodge beam attacks unscathed. You would have to also check the keyboard controls to realize its function before starting the game.In conclusion, this game is one of the best bullet hells I have ever played.  9.5/10P.S I prefer keeping the game under a window mode."

Rather than simply firing in a straight line, or at fixed angles, in SUGURI, your character -- the eponymous Suguri -- actually aims at targets directly, with a simple lock-on system, and depending on the weapon, she has to pause briefly to fire.This completely changes the dynamics of the game, with enemies doing the same, as well as firing rapid-fire homing attacks! I'd be lying if I said SUGURI is a difficult game, because it's much more than that -- as a danmaku veteran I was getting destroyed on Normal! Excellent timing, clever use of the grazing dash, and mastery of both of your equippable weapons are all required to win in SUGURI.At the time of this review you can pick up SUGURI and the fighting-game sister title Acceleration of SUGURI for just five dollars together, which is an absolute steal for two inventive and fun games that will run on any computer, anywhere. I highly recommend both titles."

With the ability to carry 2 weapons at once, while having many more to unlock, there's quite a bit of variety, allowing different playstyles to develop.It's also very hard, so if you're a persistent player, this could keep you busy for a while.

,Recommended,262240,13357040,"Posted: 13 December, 2014",all,DefaultBeep,"Suguri is, as you probably have gathered by now, part of the Bullet Hell subset of Shoot 'em Up's, but a very unique take on it.You're given a lot of freedom in movement, thanks especially to the dash mechanic, which has the added bonus of allowing you to dodge certain bullets. None of the stages dragged on too long, and they actually seem to get shorter with each passing stage. You have a large range of weapons to choose from, but you only start out with three of them; the more you try the stages, however, you unlock more weapons.The story is simple, but it's actually pretty good; the characters all seem unique, thanks in part to their fights, but you don't see too much of their personalities until the sequel, Acceleration of Suguri. The art is also a bit simple, but it did grow on me; the sprites on the other hand look amazing, with the enemies sharing a distinctly different style compared to the chibi-esque style of you and the bosses.The music, on the other hand, is overall a bit above average; while there were certainly standouts, namely the final boss and the entirety of Stage 4, the rest is pretty good at best.Oh yeah, and this game is insanely hard. On my first playthrough, I could only manage Easy Mode, and even then it took me quite a few hours just to beat it. After getting more accustomed to how the game worked, though, I did finally manage to beat Normal Mode; it did take me a bit longer than it should have, however, thanks to my save data getting corrupted (I still don't know how, either).Overall, if you're looking for a difficult game that takes a while to get used to, but is a blast once you do, I would easily recommend it; it's easily become one of my favorite Shoot 'em Up games I've played, though I do still prefer its sequel."

It's hard to describe, but if you play it, you will understand.My only complain is that we don't have a manual in Steam for Suguri and there is somethings that you will need to learn by experience.Anyway, I really like the characters and the scenarios.Not forgeting the music. Just listen to the opening and you will see.Seriously, if you are like me you will be wanting to play more (even if you keep dying)  just to see how the new area will be, the next boss pattern and to listen to the next soundtrack.It's addicting, trust me and good luck.You will need it."

The game itself is easy to learn, you does only need 4 button to play. 2 for your weapons and the other 2 for your ultimate attack and dashing. For moving it depends your way playing the game, either with your keyboard or a controller. Dashing is very important in this game, because you cannot achieve anything in this game without that kind of skill...except weapons, those are unlocked after 10, 20, 30 times and so on :PIt's not for the faint-hearted. You will need at last a good dozen times to clear the first level ON EASY.The game has 3 levels of difficulty: easy, normal and hard.Doesn't cleared one level on hard so far.You must learn the patterns of your enemys attack and appearing on the display, and yeah that is really fun, especially if your friend are watching :DThere are many weapons to achieve, like bazookas, guns, a sword, mines, a flame thrower and so on.There are 7 levels in this game to clear.

You can play a level countless times, learning the enemy patterns and getting a better score each time.  I confess, this ten year old game is still one of my favorite games ever.(If you're into multiplayer, do buy ""the Acceleration of Suguri 2"" when it is localized.)

This game is pretty hard, but if you like a challenge, it's a good thing.  However, I cannot speak on the behalf on all people that they will like it.  Most casual gamers will probably say that it's too hard and give up on the 1st level.  Though, if you are persistent, you will win.  If you like shooters (I compare this to Touhou (even though I've never played Touhou) but horizontal other than vertical), anime girls, and challenge, then this game is for you.  I can't reccomend this to everyone, but for the people who love the criteria above, you will love this game.  The story is great, too.  I don't wanna spoil anything, so just play the game!

,Recommended,262240,18478900,"Posted: 14 October, 2015",all,Shioame,"One of the most brutal game in Steam currently. Normal is as hard as Dark Soul's 2nd level.There's a pattern to it, once you follow that the game becomes super easy. If you don't, you're pretty much done.I've played Sora, the prequel to this game (not available on steam, Japanese online DLsite) but I felt that this game is pretty ""old""... The dash mechanic (most important feature to dodge bullets) is cranky, it tend to jump right in to the locked target, the beam rifle completely misses the target when unless you are right in front of them...So yes it is frustrating. But so is Dark Souls.  The control is much simple and you can focus on the memorization right away.This game should deserve some attention as much as Dark Souls."

76561198127444181,Recommended,262240,27064854,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,jetb1ackx,"What can be said about this game... I love it... that's all, this game is amazing even though I have no idea how to pronounce it's name. That said, it was origionally made by the Japanese company Orange_Juice (And in fact was their first game) so that might explain the name being in Japanese.So over the name now let's talk gameplay. On my current machine it runs at a solid 61 FPS (Acourding to the in game counter which can be disabled) the game isn't too dammanding on much at all.Mechanics are solid at best if a little confusing at first due to the lack of a proper tutorial (Sora fixed this by forcing you to go through one) I figure I'll explain the two most important ones Dashing and Hyper Attacks.Dashing (Refured to as 'Hyper Dash' in the controls) allows increased movement speed and the ability to take no damage from some attacks at the cost of producing 'Heat' this 'Heat' is both good and bad as having a higher heat percentage (Max is 300%) allows you to generate Hyper Attacks faster but at the cost of taking more damage upon getting hit.Hyper Attacks are also an essential part of gameplay giving you a exteremly powerful attack and several frames of invulernabillity so timing is as important as remembering the attack itself. However despite these machanics to help and assist you this is still a Shoot 'Em Up, which means one of two things: I'm horrible at it OR it's difficult, this game falls into the second slide, the difficulty slide. This game is hard, hard at it's easyist point, the begining, if one looks in the discusions some of the threads are from people saying 'If there's no checkpoint after first stage then this game is impossible' I say this as a vetrean of the third stage: there isn't a checkpoint system in this game... unless you include the weapons being unlocked and (After beating them) the ability to re-battle bosses and even the ability to attempt stages without going through the rest of the game (Oh boy), While we're on the subject of difficulty let's talk about the difficulty spike... no that's wrong difficulty Empire State Building? Nope still too small, Mt Everest? Again no, I'd say the difficulty Olympus Mons. (Tallest mountan in the solar system) Third stage I've attempted it about ohhh... easily two-hundred times. I probably shoud stop here about the difficulty, while the game is hard it dosent punish you as much as you'd expect, what I'm saying here is the game IS possible it'll just take you ALOT of time to complete... fully... just you try and say ""I'll unlock the hidden seventeenth weapon in under twleve hours"" or ""Yes I'll get the second unique closing screen in twelve hours"" 'Cause IT AIN'T GONNA HAPEN.The music is great, in fact I'd say it's some of the best BGM I've ever heard looking further into it shows that there are two unused tracks, a mix of the first stage's BGM, an expanded version of the title track and the track from the tralier in the offical sound track (Called 'TRANCENATION of SUGURI').Sigh, I'd hate to say this, but this game isn't perfect. The difficulty spike that drops off of the face of the earth in the fifth stage (I've gotten to it a couple of times but get screwed over by not knowing the stage properly), and the lack of a tutoral are faults that Orange_Juice could have easily fixed, but the major faluts in this game come from Rockin' Anderoid... Yes THOSE guys who I slamed up against a wall in my review of AOS (The sequel to this game). Lets face it, they ♥♥♥♥ed up AGAIN. And why did they ♥♥♥♥ up you ask? Well aside from the glitchy achivements that don't trigger properly and one that dosen't trigger at all and not to mention AOS being the flop it was, they ♥♥♥♥ed up by not putting SUGURI Perfect Edition on Steam... Now why is this a ♥♥♥♥ up? Because Perfect Edition had the OST's with it... so to get the complete OST you have to convert the BGM and get some of the tracks off of YouTube, then if you're picky or use WinAmp (Both like me) you have to get Audacity (Or a similar program) and change the track title, add track numbers and an artst yourself.Let's just hope Fruitbat Factory treat Suguri better by having a decent launch of AOS2... and by going overboard with the soundtracks... which they have.So in retrospect:Good game, celebrating it's tenth anerversery this year, great mechanics that admitently make the game EXTERMELY interesting to play and figure out the best way to complete each stage, great music composed by DEKU and a game made by a great company.However, with the lack of an OST on Steam, the VERY glitchey achivements, the HUGE difficulty spike and the flop it was partnered with this game failed on steam, which is a shame. I certanly enjoy every minute of gameplay, knowing that each time I play a stage I get one play to the day the world will end. The day I finish this game... 100%, though finishing it would be enough for me at the moment."

Its an Addictive Fustration making game that has something very special about it.The first thing you will want to know considering it tags itself as Bullet hell is, ""Does it feel cheap when you lose?""Absolutely not, and its one of the main reasons why I love this game. Theres never been a point where I have dies and felt that it was impossible. Losing in this game is down straight and true to Player error. Theres always away to beat the level and its that wanting to come back and finally beat that level that makes me want to play more. The game is very fustrating yet at the same time extremely fun to play at the same time.Another Big highlight I want to point out is the Soundtrack. I don't know what it is With Orange juice but all the games they have developed have a great soundtrack. QP Shooting Dangerous had it. 100% Orange had it and if anything Suguri has it even better. It's a key point that people overlook in these kind of games. The right music adds so much more to your experience and Suguri has the perfect soundtrack to make you want to play it.Performance wise. It plays at a solid 60fps smooth and silky. I haven't experienced any slowdown when things have got rather manic on the screen and it helps to the overall experience.The Game also accomadates a good number of different guns and weapons, Allowing for a more personal experience. However, You may find that what works on one level may not work on another. Its like the game actively encourages you to either master your primary weapons or change your loadout to suit the kind of level and projectiles that you will face.Finally I will say the visauls of the game may look dated, but they are certainly acceptable. A game of this age is never gonna look the greatest but the quality is there in the right places when it is needed.Overall while its still early in 2015 and this being a rather oldish game, I certainly put it up there with my favourites of the year so far. It sits there in your library, taunting you to give it another go. To beat that next level and when you do, The rush of excitement and joy are on another level. Check out the tracklist if you can as well, it will not dissapoint you."

Most of the ones that you can't dash through are the ones you can destroy by shooting at. While there's not much story the character design's pretty nice even though I still think Iru's a guy. Gameplay is very fun and features an Arcade mode but if you can't get through all the missions without dying you can tackle them one at a time.
76561198074799165,Recommended,262240,17127701,"Posted: 19 July, 2015",all,Michael777,"Suguri is a very challenging bullet hell style shooter with a few major differences to the normal style.If you don't like games where you have to try levels over and over again to get through you will NOT like Suguri. If you do, then read on.Suguri's plotline follows a girl named Suguri who has been given powers by her father after she encounters hostile enemies in the sky. She meets several members of a race of humanoids along this journey who wish to inhabit her planet... forcefully, by killing everyone else.You go through 7 levels usually with the stage-miniboss-stage-boss layout however some stages divert from this norm.The main thing that sets Suguri apart is the 'dash' feature. This makes it so she can just pass through most energy based attacks whilst taking no damage. However this raises her heat gauge, and the higher her heat gauge is, the more damage she takes. Another thing is her 'hyper'. This varies based on which weapon she has equipped but will unleash a large attack whilst protecting you from damage for a few seconds.A thing I find in a lot of bullet helly games is that they just feel cheap. You could be going through after making a lot of progress then something OHKOs you or there is an attack that you can't dodge. I never felt this in Suguri. This is because they have warning text when something big is going to happen so you can prepare and if you're cornered, you can just dash or hyper your way out.A main part of this game are the bosses. I never actually disliked any of them character wise EXCEPT one, but that's kinda spoilery so i'll move on. Each boss felt like they were like you, and I always felt slight remorse after killing them, after the RUSH OF EXCITEMENT. This game makes boss kills feel REALLY REWARDING.Onto the graphics, they're definitely dated, but I still like how the game itself looks, especially the characters. The game really suits it's graphics style and the fact that the graphics were bad by today's standards never got in the way of gameplay.The music though, is very good. It never failed to make me pumped up for the level ahead and to me it never felt repetitive although I had played through the levels countless times.In conclusion, Suguri is a very difficult game with a lot of features that make it feel like it's your fault when you die, not the game's. The game never fails to make me want to try new things and carry on until I finally beat that boss. The only thing that I felt could be improved, was the segments where you were 'indoors' as the bullets kinda glitch when hugging the wall, but thats 2 of 14 segments, so it's really not that big a deal. I'd reccomend it to anyone seeking a challenge and a decent story (towards the end)."

If you drool so much, people will think you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are already rumors...""However, Hime wasn't listening. She slowly, almost mechanically turned around and tried to walk away. However, Sugary was quick enough to grab her and pull her away from the edge of the cliff.S:""Idiot! Do you want to die!?""H:""Ughhhh.....""They came here to celebrate their second anniversary, but so far, the date has been a total disaster. Hime doesn't seem to be aware of her surroundings, and, if left alone, may cause harm to herself or the others. Suguri was hoping that, perhaps, the beautiful view from the cliff's edge will return her beloved's memories...but so far, nothing has changed.She's been like that ever since they had sex for the first time two years ago. After binding Suguri with chains, she just..turned off...and she's been like that ever since.Nevermind the embarassment of being found in the basement, bound in chains, next to a naked Hime lying in a pool of her own drool.S:""I give up let's go home""Just as she was about to give up and drag Hime back home, she noticed that there was someone else standing beside them. A tierd, middle aged woman, holding a giant toilet cleaner.Tomomo:""I am Magical Girl Demon Lord Tomomo! Mwahahahahaaha!~""Great. Another lunatic.Ignoring Tomomo, Suguri took Hime's hand....Hime:""Gwaaah?""....and pulled her away down the path they came here.However, the strange woman followed them.Tomomo:""D-don't just ignore me, baka yaro! I am the one who made Hime like that! And only I can return her to normal!!""However, before she was able to finish her sentence, Suguri and Hime have already dashed away. Tomomo was left alone on the cliffedge. The view was indeed, beautiful. Just as the sun dissapeard beyond the horizon, Tomomo decided that there is no point in further continuing her miserable, attention-starved existance, leaped down, and broke her neck.THE END"

This is the main thing that completely ruins the game for me. Each time you shoot, you fire a shot (that will usually miss unless you're point-blank) and you'll end up getting hit by other projectiles on screen that were fired at you as you were taking your shot at one of the many enemies on screen. It doesn't help that about half the enemies feel like damage sponges, and your more powerful shots are often blocked by their own missile projectiles.The ""dash"" feature (i.e. what the ""focus"" feature would be in other bullet hell games that slows your movement and focuses fire) makes you move very quickly and invulnerable to energy-type bullets, but your movement is nonstop and hard to control, making it more than easy to end up crashing into missile-type bullets.It makes no sense to me as to why the style of gameplay should directly clash with what bullet hell gameplay is set out to be.It just feels pathetic when I've beaten other bullet hell games (some even on their respective Hard difficulties) yet can't even beat the first level of this game on easy. I gave this game several chances, and despite my fondness of Orange_Juice and its characters, I can't find any enjoyment in playing this game."

First off, it is really, really hard, and there are no continues.  I don't mind games being hard, but the problem is that the levels weren't fun enough for me to want to practice them as many times as I would need to in order to continue on.  For this reason, I never even made it past the 2nd level and even though I only spent about an hour and a half on this game, I never feel like going back to it.  I would have loved to at least see the rest of the levels, so it would be nice if there were continues on Easy mode.  I think the dash mechanic is what made the game so difficult for me but at the end of the day there are just so many better shmups on Steam that I would rather spend my time on, like Ikaruga, Crimson Clover, Eschatos, etc.  I can really only recommend this if it is very cheap, or part of a bundle."

No hard feelings, I love bullet hells/shmup games with cute characters like this but I feel it needs some improvements.Pros- Cute character designs- Really nice idea, and I always welcome more japanese-styled games on here- Good that you can switch weapons from start. Do this unless it gets an update.Cons- Moving needs improvement, unless you really are supposed not to dodge them. And this is regardless if you use controller or not(works pretty good with both) and you move really slow and cannot dodge well.- Need to improve default weapon, perhaps increase its attack speed.- Add more bullest to dodge, it makes it bad when it's just a few and you cannot move freely.If you like cute games or bullet hells, get it. But I would wait for updates/improvements and there are better ones out there."

Because of its simple yet graceful Dash mechanic.This game really punishes you for any little mistake you make, which can make you play through the whole game (or level) again. However, the replay value makes up for that!I found the game to be very easy to get into, and enjoyed it whole-heartedly until beating it.Surely, I would play Suguri anytime again, and I recommend this game to anyone that is into any sort of fast-paced action.P.S. Hime is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."

The game offers a ton of replayability if you want to go for all achievements, and different playthroughs with different weapon choices, and if you like fast paced levels and hard bosses, which is to be expected of any bullet hell game, then this is the game is for you."
