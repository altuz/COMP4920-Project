I have spent at least 200 hours playing this game by myself/ when I was younger and I instantly bought this game on steam.There's an insane number of weapons to buy, you can level them up, you can purchase upgrades for your ship, pick a combination of weapons you like depending on your playstyle. There's also a good selection of bombs and missiles.The music is amazing ( 30+ soundtracks from Machinae Supremacy, an amazing Sid Metal band, ) the replayability is good, they added achievements, trading cards, some tweaks and it works on 1920x1080 resolution. I recommend buying this game in a heartbeat if you liked any kind of space shooters because it's always been my favorite one and you will definately like it.After playing for an hour or so, I can tell it's just as good as I remember it, but, I also used to play on easy and I just tried hard, way too hard for me, normal offers me a fair challenge and the game is very enjoyable. :)"

However I never actually paid for the game.Finally, years later it is released on Steam and it's just as awesome as when it originally came out.Jets 'n' Guns is a fantastic space side scrolling shooter, with heaps of equipment to buy and loads of upgrades. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and very fitting.My favorite part about J'n'G is being able to try countless configurations on the ships to see which combination will help me finally finish my current level. When you buy an item you can always sell it back for the buying value, so you are never restricted to what combinations you want to attempt.This is an intense retro shooter with a crazy amount of replayability, don't miss this one out!"

Well that would have to be this old runt of a shooter game.This game is the closest equivalent of giving a shotgun to a hobo with crooked teeth and thinking it's a great idea. It stinks, it's ugly but damn it's awesome at the same time.What to expect when you fire this game up: Weird practice area where you can test gun setups. then a crappy looking shop that got a TV-Shop like selection of guns.So grab some guns, test them if you like and go do some missions. Early missions will be hard as hell and the difficulty level will be kept quite high for quite some time - until you either read from guides what you should concentrate on - or buy and test guns until you find the ones that match your style.  Difficulty actualy goes down as go further into the game and kit your new ships better and learn the ropes. New challenging bosses come to yank the difficulty up but you are prepared. Or should be. Did i mention this game is quite hard - but fair if you do your testing/homework on the testing arena.Still have not completed the game but i do seem to be 2/3 trough at this time and it's been an awesome ride. I also expect to re-play this game at some point with different approach to loadouts.Best things last: this game is dirt cheap, is often discounted or found in the bundles. If you like shumps you really do MUST have this game in your library.  It really is that good that i will from now on use this game as a reference when comparing games."

Once you have finished the game it will automatically continue on the next level of difficulty with all your money/items kept.Advice 2: alway try different weapons configurations and upgrade weapons. Remember : there is no penalty in selling weapons (no money lost). And read the advices the game give sometimes about the kind of weapons you need.Advice 3: You might have to run to survive a level if your weapons are not good enough (for me it was in the Beer level).

Don't believe me?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6oAcZ93hNYAs a sidescrolling shmup you're gonna see a lot of bullets but it's ok, your ship has tons of hp so being hit isn't instant death.That's right you can get hit, and it's not that big a deal--as long as it isn't another ship ramming into you, if that happens you die in a frustrating instant.As you progress you upgrade and swap your ship--you start rockin a little harder with each level. There's always more things to kill than your ship can fire at and to make things worse you end up juggling weapon cooldown. Lame.The difficulty in this game stems from brief sections where the game floods you with tons of ships and bullets at the same time. You want to dodge the bullets but the only direction you can fly is into another ship, which will kill you faster than the bullets.Oh and one more thing. There's a delay in pressing any directional button, frustrating imprecision I'd expect from an ice level in a shoddy platformer, not the super precise power genre of shmup games. Fix it or I'm calling a lawyer."

Oh, and just about the raddest and baddest soundtrack you'll ever hear for a videogame.Jets N Guns Gold has by far more content and challenge to offer than just about any shooter before it, with a campaign that took me at least a year to complete on Normal.  This is a game you'll want to play multiple times, and upgrades/weapons carry over, so beating it on Easy is only the beginning.The challenge is there in full force but without being too impossible for newcomers thanks to a hugely robust weapon catalogue and upgrade system, all it takes is a little tinkering and you'll be on your way to becoming a Jets N Guns master!"

There's also an occasional boss you'll have to fight, as well as several unique levels where you zip around in your spacesuit instead of being in your ship. Also like in Tyrian and Raptor, you have a rather ample supply of armor (and repair options), so it's quite a bit more comfortable to play than the Japanese-type 1-hit-and-you-dead shoot'em-ups.The story is wacky and rather nonsensical, as are the weapon, level and enemy designs (there's a gun that literally shoots Superman clones, you pick up secret duckies along the way, and there's the borg-like alien race which is literally beer) and the game doesn't really take itself very seriously, but it creates a strangely interesting atmosphere which I really liked.It's hard as nails, too! Don't expect any hand-holding, and expect to die and restart levels- or even the entire game, because you CAN screw up your ship build and it WILL turn out to be impossible to complete later levels if you don't know what you're doing. I recommend playing on a lower difficulty level to begin with and get familiar with the game mechanics (which boil down to ""kill as many things as you can because you really need all the money you can get"").I'm really glad this game found its way on Steam- it has my full recommendation!"

76561198065053338,Recommended,262260,22262226,"Posted: 5 April, 2016",all,Cheesus,"I remember playing this game years ago as a child, so finding it on steam was a pleasant surprise.  Great graphic style and music still hold up to this day, although some things are a tad dated (I'm looking at you, resolution).The game has a fairly steep learning curve, with 3 starting difficulties (I went with hard and the first few levels were brutal until I got the hang of the game).  Shooting down ships earns the player precious credits, so depending on how OCD the player is, this may lead to an easy or difficult late game, although I think the game generally tends towards being slightly easier (especially leading up to the brutal last boss fight); if you're really stuck the game also lets you cheat fairly easily for the price of being branded a cheat and presumably disabling steam achievements.For most of my hard mode playthrough, difficulty rose at an appropriate level to keep me challenged without being unfairly difficult, although some weapons are noticably better/worse than their counterparts.   You could take this as a positive or negative thing depending on your outlook; most weapons have a clear use for at least one difficulty setting/level and beyond that player can intentionally downgrade to flashier (and weaker) gun as a handicap or the cool factor.It can be difficult to see enemy projectiles at times, but this is only really an issue when the player has lots of flashy weapons shooting at the same time, which I only really found a problem on the second playthrough, at which point you're pretty much invincible anyway.For me, the game only stopped being enjoyable when it became too easy and I had time to be bored; this really only happened in my second playthrough where I cleared the hard waves instantly and then had nothing to do or dodge until the next wave spawned.  For this reason I'd suggest trying the game on at least normal or hard difficulty for maximum enjoyment and replay value.Overall I'd recommend this game if you're seeking a fun shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously and (mostly) challenges you in a fair way."

,Recommended,262260,8995615,"Posted: 6 February, 2014",all,krayzkrok,"I'd forgotten how good this game is; I played it for hours back when it was first released. If you like side-scrolling shoot em ups, or just crazy shooting mayhem in general, you really can't go wrong with it. Fair warning, it's damn hard! Play on easy if you can't take the challenge, but normal is just enormous fun. When you die, you're back in the action within a couple of seconds, and you'll thank the devs for that because you'll die a lot. The gameplay is complete madness, everything is trying to kill you, and when you shoot down anything or blow up any ground installation, the guys manning it stream out or fall to their deaths, and you can smear them across your windscreen or riddle them with plasma as you wish. Sounds gory, and it is, but it's pretty mild cartoon violence unless red pixels horrify you. Before long (ie. 5 seconds onto the start of the level) there are bullets, bodies and pixel blood spots flying everywhere, explosions and crashing planes triggering more explosions, all set to a rockin' heavy metal / chip soundtrack that still sounds great. If that doesn't appeal to you, you should probably seek therapy! Gameplay wise, each level begins with a shop where you can buy, sell or upgrade your weapons and a selection of fun components that do everything from highlight wanted bounty hunters to earning you millions by streaming your exploits to a TV show (!). More mundane components do things like improve your hull or heat dissipation. The varied selection of weapons, bombs and ships is essential to understand if you want to progress in the game, particularly on the harder difficulties, because specific ship / weapon setups are much better than others at handling certain levels, the fun lies in trying different combos. Can't get past that bit on level 2? Go back to the shop and try another combination. I suppose the only downside is due to the age of the game it doesn't support multiple resolutions, although you can play it windowed at native res or full screen at whatever resolution you're using. Frankly it looks fine, the art holds up well, and once the chaos begins you'll hardly notice.So yeah, it's just about the most fun you can have while scrolling to the right. Highly recommended if you're remotely into this genre."

It was the first game for me in this genre,which came close to the gameplay, atmosphere and sheer fun playing, without beingpunishing, since X-Out in 1989. And it is still the only one since then. There havebeen sidescrolling shooters in the last years, some lackluster, some quiet good.But Jets'n'Guns just has the right parts, put together with a lot of heart, good designand an overall direction that lets it stand out.With its beautiful 2d art it even stands the test of time and manages to still lookbeautiful in 2014 on a resulation of 1900x1200. I even dare say, it looks betterthan some titles in the genre of the last years.Jets'n'Guns will keep you on your toes and lets you forget the time.

Game is hard in beginnings (gets even harder in GOLD edition), but gets much easier and fur more rewarding later when you get access to top weapons (S.T.Y.X, Omnigun NT2, Tsunami generator...). Sometimes i catch myself just holding the fire button, randomly crashing in everything that is on the screen knowing it won't hurt me anyway and feasting upon an image of ultimate destruction and chaos - this is how i imagine apocalypse.Nevertheless, I personally like the original version more, as it was a bit easier (didn't have to buy Mig and got it on the third level + get access to top weapons before finishing the game was nice). New levels in GOLD edition are not bad, they are just not as much fun. There are exceptions, of course, but mostly - it just prolongs the game time. I love new weapons, which, sadly, appear after you finish the game at least once, however their pricing is way - WAY - too high. You will find out, that in order to fully equip your ship with, for example hydra machinegun, you are going to have to finish the game like four times, which is absurd, since the power of that weapon doesn't get anywhere close to Tsunami beta, which is much cheaper. That said - there are some ubalanced things that need to be corrected."

It's fun, it's funny, has amazing variety in enemies, an astounding array of weapon configurations, hidden ducks, and an excellent soundtrack. This is more along the lines of the R-Type or Gradius games than the newer bullet-hell style shooters, which is how I like my SHMUPS, so that works for me.If you find any pleasure in using a spaceship to blast other spaceships on a 2D plane, get this.Word of advice: The game is meant to be played through more than once (despite having 40+ stages) and your guns are a bit underpowered on normal mode at the beginning. I'd recommend starting on easy, then bumping up the difficulty on subsequent new-game-plus plays where you already have your armory built up."

Green,"This is a great game; I'd consider it a classic, and it feels like an enhancement or deluxe version of one of those space-shooter Flash games that you might have played years ago. It has tons of action, a wealth of weapons and upgrades to choose from, and it's just a blast destroying almost anything that comes in your way. What makes it even more satisfying is that anything you destroy, yes, anything, gives you points towards buying new things.The story is all over the place and doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's quite a good thing, because this isn't a very story-driven game. Unless you're playing on the easiest difficulty, you'll probably find that JnG is quite challenging and you'll likely need a few tries to overcome most levels, even the earlier ones. This isn't a bad thing either, since it forces you to come up with your own strategies, and prioritize which weapons to use and which enemies to avoid or focus on. And there are LOTS of enemies around so it'll feel like a sort of bullet hell game, though it really isn't a true one.With very challenging and satisfying gameplay, dozens of levels, graphics that still look great, and an excellent soundtrack that pumps you up, if you're a fan of arcade-style shooters, or you're just looking for a good action game that isn't too expensive, JnG Gold should be more than worth its weight in...Gold."

Add to that you got lots of different guns, ships and upgrades that unlock as you go in addition to secret levels, weapons and achievements.The maps are very challenging even on the easiest difficulty and the game even has a few mini-games.For replayability, once you're done with the campaign, you can choose to start over with the same character, allowing you to get even more cash for guns (you won't even unlock everything during your first run) while trying to pwn your last highscores while the difficulty increases one level.Personally I just love these colourfull and detailed pixel based graphics and wish there were more of this kind.Having played a lot of side-scroll shoot-em-ups I'm definitly placing this one up top, giving it my first 5 ever!1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played"
,Recommended,262260,27886740,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,XenoZooValentine,"EDIT: I previously thought this game uses Steam Cloud for saves. I was mistaken, it does not.If you liked games like Raptor, Stargunner, and UN Squadron (a.k.a. Area 88) then you're in for something special.Jets'n'Guns Gold is a side-scrolling shooter, where you play as a mercenary fighter pilot. You make money by destroying targets, and occasionally picking up bonus items you can sell later. Shops sell new weapons and ships, which can be upgraded for extra money. New items unlock as your total score rises, and a few hidden weapons and ships can also be found, if you know where to look in certain levels. New ships have better stats, and more slots to mount more weapons.I used the mouse for control, and had no trouble with it. Default controls: Mouse to move, left button fire, right button bomb, middle button for remote control, and mousewheel for rotary cage. There's a gadget that gives a ""bullet time"" mode, I don't use it often so I used the keyboard for that, as the game doesn't support the side buttons on my mouse.The best thing about the shop system in this game is that you can sell stuff back for full price! This lets you experiment with different loadouts easily, like buying bombs for a ground attack mission, then selling them back for a space mission.Guns have unlimited ammo, but some generate heat. When your heat meter builds up to 100%, guns stop firing until it drops back to 80%, depending on your ship's cooling system this may take about a second. In practice, this means that if you hold down the trigger, the guns will keep firing in short bursts, which isn't so bad. It's much less annoying than the way most games use the heat mechanic, and gives you a reason to aim your shots instead of just spray and pray. Generally, machineguns make less heat than beam weapons, so it's possible to build a loadout that never overheats. Missiles fire with your guns and don't make any heat, bomb launchers use an ammo meter that takes seconds to reload.Weapons can be upgraded, which gives them some combination of more damage, higher rate of fire, and/or more shot streams at once. Ships can also be upgraded to have better cooling systems, tougher armor, faster engines, and so on.Depending on the ship, you can also install various gadgets. Two quite original gadgets merit extra attention here:The RemCon (remote control) is a hacking device that shoots a beam at a downward angle, which can be used to take control of hackable objects. Some are just containers that you can open for bonuses, but you can also do stuff like hack a dump truck and make it run over the enemy, or hack an armored missile launcher to make it overheat and explode.The Rotary Cage is a gadget you can install on some ships, that lets you rotate the guns in your front weapon slots, from a narrow forward spread all the way to a triangular backward spread. You can change the angle quickly with the mousewheel in combat. (Not all weapons can be turned with this device, so check for the sextant icon on the weapon description before trying it.) I liked this so much that I'm surprised other games haven't ripped off this idea yet.Other gadgets incude stuff like a power shield that blocks incoming damage for heat, a TV camera that gives you extra money for broadcasting your missions, a time compressor that gives a (really somewhat awkward) ""bullet time"" ability, and PDA to guess unlock codes (via a minigame) of captured cargo containers, which also adds a falling block minigame.The art style reminds me a lot of that Heavy Metal magazine from the eighties. Bizarre and cartoony ship designs and freaky alien monsters are the norm, all set in a rusty, grimy cyberpunk future. There's enough variety in level themes between surface and space levels to keep it interesting. The story is told in comic book pages in between missions. The last few ships in the game have different skins or fancy paint jobs, that you can change for free at the item shop.Sound and music are both excellent, with lots of rumbling explosions and wailing guitar riffs.The game allows nine save slots plus a quicksave. Getting destroyed lets you respawn from the last checkpoint you reached, or go back to the shop to start the level over. Finishing the game lets you start over with all your stuff on a higher difficulty, additional loops raise enemy toughness.Play balance is overall very solid. There was an update a while ago that fixed some minor bugs, and rebalanced a bunch of stuff, based on Steam forum feedback. It's notable that the devs did this long after release; better late than never.If I have any gripes with the game, it's this: You know that part in some games where you lose all your stuff for some reason, and have to finish a level with little or no useful gear to get it all back? Well, there are a few levels where you're forced to use a very basic ship for various story reasons. At least most of these levels are short and not too complicated.All in all, I feel like I got way more than my money's worth out of this. It's hard to find good shmups these days, but this is a true love letter to the genre. Thanks to Rake in Grass for a job well done, and I'm looking forward to the sequel!"

It was made by a Czech developer Rake in Grass, while the music was performed by Machinae Supremacy. Its genre is old-school side-scrolling Shoot´em Up.The core of the game, its mechanics, is rock solid. Controls are tight and everything feels smooth. You start slowly but eventually you will arm your little ship to a frankly ludicrous degree. By that point, explosions and bodies and wreckage will litter your screen constantly. Variety of weapons and ships is suffiecient. The humour of the game is great and full of nerdy references. And the music is spot on. You won´t turn it of if you´reinto metal.On the other hand, while the game does very well what is seeks to do, it can get very repetitive. If you do not enjoy the core gameplay loop - i.e. blow everything up, further levels and playthroughs might not be for you. I did experience few crashes and also had some problems with resolution, but no deal breakers. However on higher difficulties, some levels become a real pain and you will die over and over, which is rage inducing.Hence we come to the final verdict. It´s hit or miss, to tell the truth. If you enjoy the gameplay loop, music, humour and above all, the never ending carnage, you will love the game. If you do not, it´s no good. The game won´t change. What it does it does superbly. What it does is not for everyone, though."

I should be shot into the sun for that.This has become one of my all time favorite games. Its a horizontal shooter with the ability to “pimp your ship”. Choose a body, load it up with guns and fly out. ALSO, the game allows you to sell your stuff for the same price you bought it for, so go nuts and play around with the loadout to your hearts content. That alone made it a standout game and something to recommend to anyone new to shoot-em-ups.If you’re a beginner, or just aren’t good at these types of games, start on “Too fat to die” so you can build currency. Every time you beat the game the game goes up a difficulty level and a good deal of them you can only access on beating the game through additional playthroughs and certain guns you can only get by playing on higher difficulties. ALSO your currency carries over in each playthrough.A word to the wise. Their are several segments where you’ll be asked to leave your ride for another one. While some can be annoying, others can be enjoyable and help break up the monotony. Also, aftr going through one that drove you nuts makes getting back to shooting everything in your own ship of choice that much sweeter.The only complaint I have with the game is that once these segments are over, you need to retweak your ship and the fact that you cannot save loadouts. Its annoying, but not enough for me to turn people away from it.Its an old game, but its an old game that hold up VERY WELL.

I have completed the game at least 20 times (over 120 hour playtime) and still enjoying.This game is a side scrolling shoot them up game with lots of weapons, upgrades, enemies lots of hidden secrets en much more. What makes this shump so good? I will sum it up for you.Graphics/sounds/music:I love them all. Explosions are satisfying. Music are made from a real band!Enemies:A great variety of enemies. From tiny troops that you can kill by “touching” them with your ship to a horrific boss. During the game you will face pirates, aliens, mutants and even zombies! Ohh, zombies I really love them. There is a map with tons of them. They throw brains to you lol. Anyways in that map, you are willing to buy a tool “TV show cast” (can’t remember its name exactly). That tool will stream your killing action to the world as entertainment. For you as player, you will earn a  very nice amount of money for every multi kill. It goes from multikill (5 kills at once) to massacre (a lot of kills at once) to annihilation (name says all).Weapons:The amount of different weapons is massive. At some point, you can buy weapons that the bosses has used against you.  How amazing is that? Those weapons can be upgraded. Some weapons can be upgraded 3 times, other more than 6 times.  What I love in this game is, you will never lose your money. Every weapons/upgrades you bought, you can sell it back for the price you have bought.  It means, you can try any combo infinitely. Believe me, you will need it on normal difficulty already.Weapons has four categories: Front, rear, bombs and missileShips:These are really important. Different ships has different pros and cons. Some ships allows you to buy special tools, like ship repair, better shields, a time vortex to slow down the game on demand in hectic situation etc. Other ships allows you to carry more weapons from different weapon category (front, rear, and missile). Every ship has different amount of health/shield/heat sink.Secrets:There are many different secrets in this game to be discovered. There are secret maps, no spoiler on this. There are secret weapons. I love the tomato shooter and the baseball stick. Both awesome and useless at the same time. However, there are strong secret weapons ingame. Secret weapons cannot be bought. You can only get them by finding them on specific missions. If you want x times of a secret weapon, you need to complete game x times. Secret ship models, gotta love it. if you ever wanted to fly in a ship like one of the bosses you have faced. I wish you good hunting to this secret.Other nice things:In game, you can collect cargo that is locked. When you have finished the mission. You are willing to unlock these cargos. In order to unlock, you need to buy a Hacking tool. It is like a simplified mastermind game. Another nice thing is bounty hunter. You might catch a criminal. When you finished the game, you can do 2 things with him. Delivering him to the cops and claim the money prize or let the criminal bribe you. When you allow him to bribe you, you can get nothing or up to twice the money the cops are offering. Choose wisely…Almost finished.Replay value:You might be wondering why I completed the game more than 20 times and still playing.There are three things that increase the replay value.1) Every time you have completed a game, you will continue at mission 1 with a higher difficulty. You have read it right, you will CONTINUE. It means that you keep everything that you have unlocked/bought. That is nice, you can test if your strongest weapon can handle the normal difficulty.2) Even more powerful  weapons will only be unlocked when you play the game for the second time. These weapons are strong, but it comes with a price. You need to complete the game several times to get enough money to buy x times of it + fully upgrade them. This will keep you busy for a while.3) Did you found all secret maps, ships and weapons? You want x times of that secret weapon? Then you need to complete the game x times.Overall, this shump is highly customizable. Very nice replay value with many secrets that keeps you busy.  Something I really like.Gl hfNote: When you play this for the first time, I highly recommend easy difficulty."

I actually like this, but the option would be nice.Other shmups, as much as I love them, may feel much less meaty in comparison after having played this. ;)Detailed reviewI love shmups. But my favorite variety of them - while I can definitely enjoy bullet hells as well as more casual shmups when in the right mood - has always been the R-Types and, in particular, the Gradiuses (Gradii? - Anyway... Gradius!) of the world. Somewhat lengthy, lots of upgrades and customization, and at least the illusion of choice and playstyle.Jets'n'Guns is a brilliant example of that style of game... and it goes far beyond what most entries in the above mentioned series do (with the possible exception of R-Type Final) by being both extremely long as shmups go (30+ levels, none of them very brief in and of themselves,) and jam packed with weapons (70!)The game starts out fairly challenging with your initial armaments, and only gets worse from there (at least until you become wealthy enough to unlock the best weapons.) If you aren't careful, it's extremely possible to ""screw yourself"" by not making enough money for good upgrades. Which forced me to restart the game at least once. But once you've got the hang of things, your eyes adjust to the at times difficult to see enemy projectiles, and you start racking up some respectable weapons (and leveling them up, which also costs money,) you begin to surge your way forward.Even still, on your first playthrough - even on the lowest difficulty ""too fat to die"" (which I recommend starting on, if only so when the game restarts on the next higher challenge level - whcih is how New Game Plus works here - you'll already have all your money and gadgets from the previous run) - certain levels and bosses prove a very steep uphill climb. And, it must be said, certain levels do abruptly spike in difficulty, or seem too easy compared to what came before them. Expect to die a lot as you experiment with what weapons work best for each situation, and memorize what you're up against. Old school style trial and error. (Except with checkpoints, so, not quite.)Speaking of trial and error, one of the most welcome and refreshing things this game does, is GIVE YOU BACK YOUR FULL PURCHASE PRICE WHEN SELLING WEAPONS AND UPGRADES! This is such a brilliant touch that no one ever thinks of, because we're all so indoctrinated to accept the penalty of re-selling equipment in games. But it makes perfect sense here, because the challenge comes from using the right tool and the right strategy for the job, rather than going broke and being trapped.The promise that if you can just make it through the next stage, you might come out the other side of it with enough money for that next big upgrade you've been eyeing, is what kept me playing even when the challenge seemed almost hair pullingly unfair. (Which, of course, it never was. I simply hadn't done well enough early on to afford the weapons that would make things easier on me.)I'm on my third (update: now seventh, having made it to the game's highest difficulty... although there's an achievement for doing three more runs beyond that as well if you're into that) playthrough at the time of this review, with nearly 30 hours played (update: now closing in on 60!) The game is MORE than worth the asking price, and not only is it a good deal for what it is, but it's also one of the most enjoyable shmups I've EVER played, because it scratches the ""massive number of upgrades"" itch more effectively than just about any other game out there. Add to that its whimsical art style and attitude that make Jets'n'Guns feel like it fell through a time warp from the era of Oddworld, Toejam and Earl, and Gex, and you've got a really refreshing shmup on your hands.Oh, and the music is epic. I can't say enough about it. It's just the perfect blend of video gamey techno, almost chiptune inspired wizardry to let you know this is a game, coupled with a seriously metal and at times punk rock flavor that ranges from melodic to balls to the wall heavy. It's rocking! And gorgeous! Rarely would I want to listen to the soundtrack for a shmup of all things outside of gameplay. But this one is an exception. Some real love went into this game's audio design and music, and it shows.Seriously, if you find anything writen above appealing... buy this game. I was so pleasantly surprised, I can scarcely believe the game is real, to be honest.10/10 Would get deployed from a giant phallic spaceship called Impotence and fight borg cubes full of beer bottles again. And again, and again, because I'm stuck in a time loop. (You'll find out...)"

This title is worthy of its pounding, energetic soundtrack.Visuals may be low-res and 2D, but effects still look great and the amount of things going on at the same time on the screen is very impressive. Needless to say, this game runs on almost any machine made within the last fifteen years.GameplayJets'n'Guns is a very challenging game (even on easy), but thanks to the upgrade system being remarkably flexible and allowing for many different play styles, you can overcome its sometimes punishingly hard levels - you can just sell any item, weapon or upgrade without being financially punished and experiment with a new configuration. Incredibly tight controls, no matter if you're using keyboard, mouse, gamepad or joystick, also alleviate some of the difficulty. Level and enemy design are more creative and varied than anything you've ever seen (except for somewhat disappointing boss fights) and everything is neatly tied together by a completely insane story (but in a good way - the ending alone is ingenious).ConclusionJets'n'Guns is cheap, 100% bad♥♥♥♥♥ yet intelligent, has plenty of replay value and will forever be one of my favorite games."

Basicly what you need to do is to kill and destroy all enemies that fly at you. This is probably very usual in sidescrolling spaceadventure -games. Well what makes Jets'n'Guns stick out from the mass?Well in my opinion it's many things. Wide weapon arsenal, you've got many kinds of bombs, missiles, guns (even those are divided into smaller ""groups"", they aren't all just laser 1, laser 2...). You have different ships to choose from, you can collect new weapons and ships from the levels. You have ""secrets"" and secret levels ready for ""picking up"" scattered across the standard levels. You have several gadgets that you can use on your ship. Oh, and you can also upgrade almost everything you have purchased. I have probably missed some things here but that's my overall view on this, even though I haven't finished this game yet. One more thing I'd like to add - last but surely not least - when you buy something you can sell it back for FULL price. What this means is that you can test many sets of weapons and find the best for that particular level. ONE MORE! The music is just absolutely TERRIFIC! Same goes with the ""graphics"" or textures or what is it called. And the ingame jokes that are fitted in the ""background"" of the levels.Well, for the negative sides there are almost none. When I really push myself and try to come up with cons I mainly think of the fact that you can't choose the level you want to play like ""I want to play level 24, it had cool graphics and a fun boss.""That's about it folks. Hope you found this review helpful."

This incarnation is much much much (much) more brutal than I remember. On your first play though, expect levels to last up to an hour of small step progression which mostly involves memory rather than skill. This is normal mode I’m talking about. Easy mode (""To fat to die"") is far too easy - I'm not crazy enough to even think about considering hard.There seems to be a lot more emphasis on ""strategy"" in this one too, whereas before, you could get away with choosing your favourite weapon loadouts, now you're going to be constantly swapping out to meet the level's brutally difficult requirements.This is an aspect I quite like, as it prevents you spam playing levels for gold for upgrades. Once a level is complete, that’s it for the current play though.

There's an asston of weapons and you have a lot of freedom to configure them, and you don't even have to worry at all about spending because you can just put any of your equips right back. Machinae Supremacy graced the game with an extensive and absolutely bangin' soundtrack. All of the action is hilariously explosive and visceral. Most of the game's other humor is rather on-point as well, and the story makes just the right kind of space bravado unsense to be awesome. It's even quite long, and has a new game+. It all gels together in one old-school package that is just plain fun, especially for the price. An enthusiastic yes."

However, once you have the hang of it you should be able to blast through those pesky enemy vessels and leave them burning in your wake.This isn't a game to buy for the plot, but instead when you want a dose of over the top action in a side-scrolling world."

Maneuver the fire and survive, this game is about style, you will get variety of options to select from, do you worry about health recovery and surviving or shooting with massive power weapons in short times because the heater won't take it, or do you prefer to keep shooting all the time and try your best to dodge. Do you want your airplane to shoot on one side or do you like to rotate your weapons. you will find in the game when you play it that there is more than one way to destroy the enemy, sometimes firepower is not everything ... it is about firing at the right time, but the choice is yours if you just wana focus blindly on fire power and keep ur focus on better things like Survive ... or just wana play it risky and try to do smart moves and than find out if was smart or not. Do you care about getting as much cash as possible in every level or you just want to do the objective and save your skin ? the game give you some options to increase your cash. Each choice has its own cons and pros.Every mission you will get a chance to buy\sell\upgrade your weapons\bombs\tools and the best thing if you don't like them you don't have to worry, you can sell them any time or downgrade your items any time with the same price without troubling you about money, so you can change your style from now and then and try new things. And you could test your airplane before you start the mission just click on the red button with T below your airplane to see if the cooling system is satisfying and if your firepower is good enough for you.The game play is balance and the control is more than fine. In the game dialog between the levels they will give you part of the story and some tips about control and the game, it will show you how the game works slowly without boring you to death by forcing you to play a tutorial map before you could try the game.The game is quite hard specially in the advance levels, don't expect to kill all enemies or collect all bonuses from the first game run, actually in some levels you will be lucky if you could pass them from the first time, learn about the levels than abort the map and adjust your style to fit, experience with the game and it will amaze you with the plants of options that gives you to play this game. Latter on after you finish the game they will let you start it over with all our upgrades and money in that time you could do whatever you want ... Finish all the level with one weapon with 0 damage, or whatever but if you just start it just try to survive I guess.Story:yes story, actually most of these games don't have a story but this one is quite amazing, it start slow at first and it just introduce you to the theme of the story and how things works in the game universe but it become more interesting in the advance. I know a lot of players ignore the story completely in those games but I don't advise that in here.Music:ohh my god, the music, one of the things that make this game an epic is the music mixed with the actions, I just love it. It always fit the theme of the level.Basically what I am saying this game really worth anyone time and it is fun, don't get scared when i said it is difficult you could put it easy if you are not a big fun of watching a screen with 100 bullets and play it on easy, the diffculty choice is yours but i advise you guys to try it on hard first, this game needs good eyes for watching not only the bullets, but what is going on as well, how enemys are dying and keep an eye for secreats and strange thigns too ... they are plenty of them in here.I am surprised why did steam put this low price on it, I would buy it even for 20 dollars it just worth that price."

Not only do you shoot enemy ships, when you shoot them down the pilots will parachute out, and you can shoot or just ram them! There are enemy soldiers on the ground, and you can shoot (or ram) them, too! Or shoot down a ship so it crashes on them and explodes and they all die in a blazing inferno of fire, screaming for their lives! You can shoot up enemy buildings, and they'll explode, too (again: soldiers, fire, screams)! You can shoot up enemy cows! MOO *splort*! EVERYTHING EXPLODES! And then you do, too! Because it does get close to bullet hell levels of, um, challenging at points. But that's awesome, too!Also, the music seriously rocks. SERIOUSLY. Look it up on Youtube. Or watch the trailer on Steam, or download the soundtrack from Machinae Supremacy's site, or whatever.You also get to customize your ship and its weaponry and equipment to an extent rarely seen in shooters - the only thing that really compares, I think, is good old Tyrian 2000, and maybe some much newer stuff like Strike Vector."

Asside from the music the art is a great mix between retro and modern styles. Each level is filled with something new to see and something new to kill you in the most violent way possible.Dodging bullets is about 80% of the game while you retaliate with an arsenal of upgrades for your ships and weapons. If you play this game enough you may notice the secrets found here and there to access secret levels filled with rage inducing baddies and face-palm inducing jokes. Just remember to pick up the stranded astronaughts instead of shooting them, but hey what's stopping you?Overall with little to no bugs that I've seen the $7 price tag is a deal if I've ever seen one. 10/10 recommended."

It does look somewhat out of date with a fixed resolution and no widescreen, but otherwise functions spiffingly, seems to map itself to Xinput controllers just fine, and most importantly, is still one of the most amazingly cathartic ""blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up"" scrolling shooters with an incredible soundtrack by Machinae Supremacy.The game's central mechanic is flying from left to right and shooting stuff. Make no mistake though, it is BALLS hard and even the first couple levels will seriously test your mettle. The upgrades system is very smartly designed, letting you sell off anything you don't need for full price, so you're always free to strip yourself down and try an entirely different loadout, which I strongly recommend if you don't feel like you're properly equipped for a level. If you're just dying repeatedly out of the gate, remember: enemy bullets are bad, colliding with stuff is EXTREMELY BAD.I only have a few real complaints. It's sometimes hard to tell foreground from background, which is especially critical because COLLIDING WITH STUFF IS BAD. There isn't much meaningful feedback for what's causing you the most damage (hint: it's usually colliding with stuff, that you may or may not notice), and a few of the more gimmicky stages are pretty aggravating. That said, I still love it."

Once ships start flying out from behind you, (if you suck like me) expect your survival time to be counted in seconds rather than minutes.There's a fun game here to be sure, but I think only the better shmup players are going to find it.  It's got a lot of style and it is a blast when you are actually surviving.  I get super mad, and I want to quit playing it because I'm terrible at this style of game, but at the same time, I want to keep playing because it's a cool game.I would say, if your good at this type of game get it, because you'll have a ton of fun with it.

It has the old school feel of games such as G-Darius or Zero Wing, plus it adds an awesome feature of customising your battle ship. Customize with a capital C. You start off with a few pea shooters and as you progress you get access to lasers, frag guns, missiles, bombs and new ships. Every weapon also has several levels of upgrades, including fire rate, damage and special effects like penetration or shrapnel rounds. The campaign is fairly long, spanning through various environments such as outer space (duh), jungles and even underwater. Some of the bosses will give a run for your money and defeating them comes with a sense of accomplishment. Replayability is also high, after clearing the final boss battle you start the campaign from the beginning on a higher difficulty. There are many secrets to discover, ranging from new ships and weapons to ""Lame secret spot marking items"" which can be sold for cash in the shop after every mission."

Loud, crazy, brash, with plenty of enemies, guns, and weiredness, it's an extremely satisfying shooter.You play as . . . well the plot gets kind of bizarre, but sort of a soldier turned mercinary, who goes out to save the universe by blowing up spaceships, trucks, troops, building, jets, monsters, and everything else.  As you play you earn money, unlock equipment, find hidden weapons, and far, far more.  Eventually you're customizing your own spacecraft with all sorts of crazy weaponry as you find new ways to defeat your enemies.Customization and gameplay is a big part of this.  Pick the right loadout in order to survive, pick your battles, and react fast to survive.  The wrong loadout or bad tactics can kill you - and you may need to replay a level and/or recustomize your ship to get things right.  Fortunately, anything you buy can be traded in for full price, encouraging all sorts of combos.Pretty much a must-pick up for a side scroller/bullet hell player.  But a few caveats:1) The bullet hell aspect is also based around enduring attacks and being willing to take hits.2) At times the game screen can get crowded if you build your own bullet-spewing monstrosity, so don't just think a big loadout saves the day - you might not even be able to see your ship in all the chaos.3) The plot is utterly bizarre and it's hard to tell how much is parody, throwaway jokes, actual humor, or just plain craziness.  There's also some elements that may be parodies of sexist tropes, but the plots are so crazy it's hard to know."

It's not that it's just difficult. The problem is that the difficulty comes from very cheap and poorly indicated enemy movements. You may be a few minutes into the level only to die in a mere second from an enemy flying from behind your back and coliding with you, forcing you to restart. There are checkpoints, but they are rather scarce. And unlike many proper bullet hells, here there's so much going on on the screen, with stuff coming from all directions, that dodging everything is impossible. You may take some hits, but once you collide with something your health drops drastically.It's sad, because everything else is great. The graphics, the sound effects, the soundtrack, tons of customization and a nice upgrade system. It would have been great, but the difficulty simply kills all the enjoyment. And I really hate when games rely on memorization through repetition to even beat a level.I'd say that if you've got the patience to repeat the same level segments over and over only to get them right after tons of deaths, and the overall style of J'n'G appeals to you, then you could consider the purchase.

Some scenery can be fired through, some inexplicably cant (but enemies can).  Some of it will damage you, some of it may not.

Why do Damage and Heat not budge for several upgrade levels on many weapons, even though they are actually diffferent? Why do weapons use pictograms for values and the ships use hard numbers?- No feedback when giving and taking damage. Especially irksome since the heaviest damage you can take is actually from small fast enemies buzzing through you. How did it make it through my cloud of bullets? Who knows! The boss that got me to uninstall would spit out black smoke and seperate into several sub-parts whether or not I hit it. No idea if I was damaging it.- Your ship never stops feeling clumsy as hell. It fits the aesthetic, sort of, but again the worst source of damage is collisions.

Moving the mouse slowly simply results in you not moving at all, making it unresponsive and unintuitive. And no, you can't configure the deadzone. If using a controller, you also can't map the triggers to anything, so you'll need another program such as joy2key or qjoypad unless you want to be holding down a button for the whole game. Basically, the controls could not possibly be made any worse than they are right now.In addition to the crappy controls, there's no visual indication whatsoever when you take damage. The bullets were also kind of hard to see when something exploding sends harmless particles and rubble flying around obscuring the things that actually do damage.The interface is also pretty annoying.

Just sell your current one for the same price you originally bought it and buy a different, new one.Occasionaly the game will be really strange and random, flying coffins and mausoleums with huge cannons attacking you and stuff like that.

Yet not since 1989 have you encountered anything as head-banging and gamepad-smashing as this new indie side-scrolling shoot 'em up; Jets'n'Guns Gold.The developer, Rake in Grass, has poured an incredible amount of design and detail into this little gem of Genesis-style flashback romp. Loaded with masses of enemies, a stellar array of graphic goodies, a handful of customization options and some serious silliness, this game's easily-dismissed flaws lie in it's dated conceptual design. But even then, what is dated to one player is fresh and bold to another. This is standard old-school arcade with Steam-age design (see what I did there).You play a mercenary pilot flying a space worthy fighter ship in glorious 32-bit colors. You take on 43 different missions from the standard 'defend' and 'destroy' type all the way through to the more bizarre, 'prevent alien perverts from ravaging sexy scientists' type. Environments range from space and cloudy blue skies to war torn deserts, to dense jungles and even underwater realms. As you progress, you earn more money and unlock new ships, weapons and special items.All of this would be pretty standard and even a slice of boring if not for the charming dose of 'crazy' liberally blended in. Crazy like 'flying a hot-dog truck, shooting down predatory sperm aliens, defending against zombies hurling their detached limbs at you, as you steal a super tanker of home-brewed draft away from Borg-like, self-aware beer determined to intoxicate you,' crazy. Seriously. And the game designers don't stop at mere randomness. They are very willing to poke fun at themselves as developers and even use in-game text to criticize themselves for occasionally boring graphics. (Look for the Lame Secret Spot Marking Developers Indicator.)As mentioned above, the dated core design adds some irritation. Some levels are just insanely impossible especially when some ship designs are larger than certain narrow openings that the player is required to fly through. And while blasting flying beer bottle and sperm fighters is immensely satisfying, the game does suffer a lack of replay-ability. Defeating a level rarely provides more than some extra money that you can't use until you unlock the next higher ship or find new weapons... neither of which have clearly identified goals. I kept playing with the same ship for more than 7 missions before I was offered a new choice. And while you can test your weapon upgrades and layouts before starting a level, most weapons are little more than cosmetic changes to the effects.But for a game that lets you blast millions of enemy ships, decapitate their pilots in mid-air, and blow apart 1950's Cadillacs all to some old school arcade music, you have a fun and funny waste of a Friday night. Just be sure to shower thoroughly on Saturday morning to wash the retro away."

The graphics are ''retro'' but so is the game...it's like 10 years old. I've red some of the positive AND negative reviews and saw that most of the bad ones talk about slow speeds, bad inertion of the plane, weak guns and so on...to that I say...just play a little longer dam it (you'll be clearing stages 100% very soon). It's like I sed, an old game and thus has a slow start. Sure they cud have remade it for the steam release to make it more ''modern fast paced'' but that would just kill the gameplay.Down side is the controls are still bad. Playing with a mouse is NOT RECOMENDED, use a keyboard or, if you have the patience like me, set up a gamepad (it takes a while).Music...oh my the music...best in any game to date. It's just so good and well implemented to each stage.For the low price of 6€ for a game like this is a definite recommend from me. I played 100+ hours then and it's still the game i come back to for some mindless fun (the ways you blow up some of the soldiers is just so dam funny).I recommend to play it on easy for the first time (but just the first time) just so you can get the first GOOD jet like the ZZ-Rolls or the TMiG-226 so you can fully appreciate the work that went into all those jets and guns.But if you want a challenge...start of on hard and you'll need to really find balances in gun overheat, jet speed, jet armor and firepower for each stage all the while listening to some epic shop music."

Beside aerial fight, you can also bomb the ground with a variety of bomb types.And believe me it is fun to see the lemming sized figures get blown to pieces - besides all the explosions and utter destruction.There is so much detail to this game. An hilarious amount of enemy tpyes, damage models on bigger enemies, explosives, gas tanks, gun emplacements, tanks and buildings. Hell even if an airship gets shot down it crushes down hitting, killing and mostly destroying everything it falls on.Forget about Sine Mora (yikes) or any other Shoot 'em Up you played for PC, this is the best. This is in league with games like R-Type Delta on PS1 back then. Everybody who likes this genre and does not instantly buy this game, simply makes a mistake.The music of the game is a special thing, as it was contributed by Machinae Supremacy.

It reminds me in some ways of the games made by european demoscene coders back on the old Amiga home computer. The soundtrack, humor and artistry are all that amazing!As shooters go the game is fairly hard, but that's what makes it so addictive, and it lets you experiment with different weapons options each time you restart a level.

This game has some of the finest side-scrolling, platforming, shmup action that I have played and I go back to the Jungle Hunt years. There is no lack of challenge and once you think it starting to get easier, you get hit with the wake up call that forces you to completely change your strategy. I found myself playing this one again after I beat it on normal, just so I could blow everything up with overly powerful weapons to find out that there is even more content than I thought. I'm currently on my 3rd go though playing it on hard for a new challenge. This game has way more replayability than I expected. The one thing that bugged me about this game is that a few levels had some really cheesy enemies as well as few lame weapons but these a minimal in contrast to the rest of the game. What made this even more character along with the explosions and violence was the humor and found myself chuckling in the middle of battle a few times. There is no shortage of levels, enemies, weapons, secrets and customizable ships. The controls seemed a little sensative at first but easy to overcome in a very short amount of time. Sounds were good with the 80's hair band music that seemed to fit the style of gameplay. The graphics get insane at times and I was amazed at how quickly the screen could fill up with weapon shots, enemies, explosions, etc... that you can easily get lost in the madness. I would highly recommend this to anyone and a definate picker-upper. I give this a 9 out of 10. -1 for the few levels that you are going to say ""ooooh gawd, really?"""

It doesn't take itself too seriously which makes it easy to let some of the silly enemies and concepts fade away while putting focus on gameplay.

First, it is not really compadbile with a controller, atleast at the menues. Your analog stick is used to controll a mouse cursor, which is rather werid. Second, in some movies, and such, there are smaller stars that go across the screen. Most space shooters do not, as it is harder to tell what is a bullet, and what is not. This game has that issue. If I could remove that, I bet it would be easier to see the bullets. It would also be nice to have some kind of audible feedback when you are getting hit. After a bit, your♥♥♥♥♥♥comlains of critical damage to the hull, and then you explode. Checkpoints would also be nice. Maybe I am not getting far enough ino the level to hit one, but that could be solved by having a life system, and letting me continue where I died. That would be super cool.So, its not a bad game, but I don't seem to like shoot 'em ups as much I as a thought I did."

You are a freelance hero taking jobs from suspicious people in bars untill you're called to safe the universe. This leads you through dozens of levels spread over different settings, ranging from killing everything, planetary setting, different cities, zombieinfested worlds to metal festivals. \m/The game is is held in 2D with good weapon animations and a great soundtrack delivered by the SID-Metalband Machinae Supremacy.The game has half a dozen of different ships and dizens of different weapons. Just taking the strongest weapon won't help in most missions because of the ships mechanics. Each ship has a ifferent number of weapon slots for missiles, bombs and front and back weapon slots. each weapon generates heat while firing, limiting the use of weapons so you can't simply keep firing all the time. You need to wait for the right moment to shoot or you'll be run over by the enemy as the enemy does know how to shoot back, or simply fly into you and kill you that way. This leads to tinkering over the right equipment for each level.Some levels end with bosses which require a special tactic each. Sadly most of them are equal to beat bosses in WoW: learn their attack pattern and evade their attacks, but stil, they are always challenging.I recommend Jets'n'Guns to all action game and arcade lovers. You can get a solid 6 hours of gameplay for 6 €, and after playing through once, you can restart the game with your current equipment. Sadly, the enemy strength isn't adjusted, but at least you can take revenge for all those miserable deaths.http://store.steampowered.com/app/262260/You can get it for 3,50€ + on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥http://www.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.net/category/11218/jets-n-guns-gold-steam-gift/"

As a casual player, I prefer this over so called ""bullet hell"" shmups. So, yeah, short review:Pros:+artstyle (old, but still appealing in some way);+focuses on weapon-combining. Lots of different combos and ships;+tracks are very well made;+explosions;+B-movie-type story;Cons:-it is hard to recognise what is in front of the ship and what object are in the background;-level are too long (and there are no in-game ability to speed up levels). At later playthroughs (7 and later) there are moments, when just pressing one button and waiting for level to end. Pretty stupid game design and me for playing this beyond PL4;-balance at later playthroughs made my eyeroll - enemy damage output increases slightly, but their collision damage increases significantly, so from those 43 levels only several challenged me (level without my ship). Oh, but you could say, KM, just play it without best weapons, to those peolpe I say without powerful gear this game is as lame as Borderlands playthrough with level 1 weapons.-weapon variety is impressive, BUT at the end, only few most effective stay in play - Tsunami ""beyblade"" Beta (great idea,  aggressive playstyle/close distance required), Chronic Whatever (pierces every object in the game) and Armagedonattor (big a** blast, relatively long cooldown).Btw, top negative comments give some really good points about the game, I agree with most of them, however, if you are like me - ""filthy casual"" - and have some cash to burn, I recommend you JnGGold.

Ships that generate alot of heat via laser or other heat generating weapons will have to upgrade cooling systems... other upgrades are, repair bots, armor, engines, time-dilation etc.    ...depending on shipthe visual design is original and fits in well, and the music is exceptional(rock/metal themed, sourced from a real band ""machine supremacy"") the level design is also great, and has alot of variety in combination with the various biomes and their unique enemies....the weakest aspect is probably the storyline, its presented in comic strips between each mission and after one...its not bad its acceptable, even though it is a lil corny, it has some comical references to other sci-fi games/shows/movies...it ca be a pretty difficult game if you have not ever played an intense, side/top-scrolling shootemup, i would recommend the easiest difficulty for beginners"

What truly sets this apart from others like it are the weapons. You have dozens of weapons to customize your ship with and dozens upon dozens of combinations to experiment with. And each weapon feels different, whether it's in the weapons speed, style of destruction, or type of combat. Most of the fun you have will be from trying out the different weapons and finding the most effective ones to use. But beyond the weapons, everything else is top notch for an indie shooter, which is what has made the game such a classic over it's many years of being around. The art is great, the gameplay animation is excellent, the game is long with many levels to give you hours of entertainment. Of particular note are the writing, story, and music. The story and writing are silly, parodying most sci-fi, space operas, but it's still well written and entertaining to follow. And the music is one of the big standouts of the game. Created by Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy, it's probably one of the best soundtracks for an indie action game I've ever heard, crafting a professional, well produced metal and electronic soundtrack.
