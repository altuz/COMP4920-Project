,Recommended,262410,30182174,Posted: 25 February,all,Huels,"This is the story on how this game saved me over $2,100 in repairs IRL.I’ve been a firearm owner ever since I was a kid. My father bought me my first .22 rifle when I was twelve. After I became an adult and joined the US ARMY (11B) I got more serious about my collection. It was not until I started my own company and could start buying seriously expensive firearms that I really took off.I ran into a dilemma a few months back. I had my Fully Automatic Browning M2 .50 and I could not get the charging handle to move all the way to the rear. I tried my best to ask around but nothing worked. I was about to throw in the towel and take it to my local gun smith when I remembered that World of guns existed. After going through the in-game play, I found out that it was a simple two-inch piece of metal that I had not put back in the proper place. After talking to the local gun smith. He told me that the repairs would have cost me almost $2,100 because of how much time it would have taken him along with the peace being ordered.World of Guns is so detailed and in-depth. The developers really went to full lengths to make it as realistic as possible. They must have the actual firearms in the studio to get the attention to detail that they have. I salute the developers for going the extra mile and giving us firearms fans something to be really excited about."

Unless you're playing it incredibly hardcore and dropping huge amounts of hours into it, you'll get stuck behind paywalls after 3 guns. The game is NOT that interesting to spend that much time on it, and it's clearly not worth the 49.99 ""Guns Full Access"" price which doesn't even get you all that much if you read the fine print (there are 12 other DLCs for this other than that).Don't waste your time/money on this piece of garbage."

I've played for 36 hours and unlocked 17 guns, and I could unlock  more if I started it up to do the quiz every half hour and earn an average of 1000 points each time."
,Not Recommended,262410,30126179,Posted: 23 February,all,∴ S H Λ D E ∴,"Selling this as a ""free to play"" game is such a god damn lie its almost funny. This game is basically a demo of what could have been a great gunsmithing and learning game, but was plauged by those stupid, inevitable microtransactions. The saddest part is that its actually a really cool game if you are into guns and its an even better experience if you own a few yourself. That being the best part, i dont reccommend it unless you like to spend all of your money on microtransactions or if you have a good 10+ hours time to waste just to unlock ONE of the next guns (thats not an exxageration). The only thing that will not offer you a microtransaction is the uninstall button, which is really sad considering this game is such a good idea, just it was brought down by the developers greed. With the money spent earning every single gun, car, artillery cannon, in this game (there is a lot), you could go get yourself a good small caliber rifle to start learning off of in REAL LIFE. They really had a good idea to start off with and could have made this the best gunsmithing game to date, but they got money hungry and ruined such a nice game in the process. ""Free to play"" nowadays means ""pay to win"", its really sad. This game is a perfect example of that."

The level of savagery here is off the charts--foam at the mouth deception, painting the game as free to play, turning around and giving you all the traits of a pure pay to win game.>Ridiculous grind.>Microtransactions.>Free to play surface with DLC packages that *KILL* the point of the game.>Charging outragious prices and disregarding the point of the game.>You're either a degenerate with no life who uses unfunny public shooting incident memes living in their great grandparents' home, or you're a spoiled baby being schooled by this forty year old army veteran who doesn't know about these mouth-foaming, money devouring, soul-sucking fiends in the gaming market.Okay, sorry for that. Is this worth the value the developers/publishers are releasing it at? No. Period.What could they do to make this game actually worth it?-Less grind. *Much* less.-Remove most of the DLC packs, including the unlock-all one(NO EXCEPTIONS).-More subtle emphasis on competition(personal thing, competition's a bit intimidating, and not every gun nut is here to put together a gun the fastest in a♥♥♥♥♥♥measuring contest).-Of course, remove the microtransactions.-Work on VGUI(in general, pretty sure other people would want something better than this).What good is there besides these fiends trying to snatch up your wallet by the belly?+Pretty steep into details.+Not too hard, but there are challenges for you, and engaging events.+A leveling system so that you can't just go from putting a rock onto a stick all the way to performing surgery on a Centurion tank on the fly as a newbie--allthoughthegrindis♥♥♥♥ingawful.+Indepth analysis of model workings with simple, not too distracting x-ray effects, but slow-mo effects aren't quite on par, let alone the sounds in general.+Decent learning experience for a not so new gun nut who's already pretty into guns, but needs the extra kick.There's not much else to go about for me, and while the visuals aren't on par either, they don't really need to be. You're just being baby-stepped through the technical wonders of weaponry, not much is really needed visually, as this is a game for those interested, not more than the target audience.The major problem still cannot be avoided, you will probably have to pay real money if you sped through your first very few models already, and you may pay dearly."

Also the company probably has to buy one of each of these guns.... and then find someone qualified to take them apart without failing and damaging them..... and then they would have to either make a 3d model from each and every one of the parts. So that would be either they would need to take a picture of each and every angle of the part for 3d or they would have to make the part in some kind of 3d art software either way it would not be fun nor easy and you have to take this into consideration also i made up most of the things about the 3d stuff those are ideas of mine as to how that works and i am guessing. but still.... to aquire a harpers ferry flintlock pistol..... that would be hard anyhow im a gun enthusiast and if you had these guns irl you would know its worth it to know how to take them apart all the way to clean them...... (edit) alright i played the game a bit more and i hit the wall.... there is a problem with this games earn to win system so effectively it is a pay2win free game? so basicly look at the dlcs and add that cost in and you have the cost of the game..... still worth it to know about these guns if you have them irl....."

From notable historic models, to modern military pieces, even a few vehicles, and some skeletons, this game has a lot to offer anyone who loves fiddling with intricate models, and looking at how things work.It's got a few negative quirks, though. As others have noted, the game is very unforgiving to those who don't want to pay for microtransactions. If you're just a casual player wanting to look at all the different models, expect to pay a lot.Even if you're really into the puzzle aspects, expect to throw down a few dollars on occasion for that really nice model you want to try out.Another negative is the inconsistency between models. Some models will require you to pull apart every single little screw, bolt, flange, and spring. Others will do most of the detail work for you, dissassembling large amounts of items with one click. It can be especially frustrating when trying to get the higher difficulty achievements, to figure out just how much attention to detail a specific model wants you to have. Planning and memorization are key.If you like puzzles, though, and aren't afraid to shell out a few dollars now and then, pick this up. You'll be engrossed pretty quickly, I guarantee."

Trump Inauguration SpeechEvery four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent, thank you.Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people.For too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed.The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country.Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there has been little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.This is your day.This is your celebration.And this – the United States of America – is your country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people.January 20 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement –  the likes of which the world has never seen before.Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighbourhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves.These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens a different reality exists.Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.An education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential.We are one nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, we share one nation, one home and one glorious destiny.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are one nation and their their pain is our pain; their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidised the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our own military.We've defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own.And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.But that is the past and now we are looking only to the future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power – from this day forward a new vision will govern our land – from this day forward it's going to be only America first – America first!Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries, making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down.America will start winning again; winning like never before.We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labour.We will follow two simple rules – buy American and hire American.We will seek friendship good will with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of live on anyone but, rather, to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow.We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones, and unite the civilised world against radical Islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America. And through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice.The bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity.When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.There should be no fear: we are protected and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. And most importantly we will be protected by God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.The time for empty talk is over; now arrives the hour of action.Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail; our country will thrive and prosper again.We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their hearts with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: you will never be ignored again.Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny.Together we will make America strong again; we will make America wealthy again; we will make America proud again; we will make America safe again; and yes – together we will make America great again.Thank you.God bless you.And god bless America."

If you want to know what's inside a gun then, Yes, I recommend."

76561198202051597,Recommended,262410,29661456,Posted: 2 February,all,lilshrimp01,"Not going to lie- this is a pretty awesome game. At first I was skeptical due to the fact that you have to pay 50 dollars to buy all the guns unlocked, plus 10 dollars for the gun range. Because of this I thought the ""free"" really meant ""demo,"" which after playing the tutorial I found out it wasn't a ""pay to get more play"" game. Instead, you gain experience from doing certain things to the original gun you get such as disassembling, assembling, and time trials. These activities merit you experience with which you can aquire more guns. The second gun you get, the Colt, is about 2,000 experience, so after you do a few tasks for the tutorial you will have just enough experience to buy the Colt. The unlocking in this game is sort of like a tech tree where as you can't unlock more guns until you unlock the previous gun, and as you get higher in the tree it branches off. For instance you unlock the Colt, then the MP5, then that branches off to the Bretta or Tech 9. After you complete certain tasks you gain the power to shoot the gun, customize the gun, and watch it in x-ray and slow motion to see all the working parts. To sum everything all up, if you love guns and love learning more about them, this is the game for you!"

,Recommended,262410,29814533,Posted: 9 February,all,██████,"The game's objective is easily outlined and aptly described by its title:You have a gun. You take the gun apart. You put the gun back together.It begins with a field strip. Then a disassembly. Then a reassembly. The game holds your hand at that stage, so you get a rough idea of where you're going.Then, after getting a run through how to work the gun, you get the Game modes, playing against the clock and your own ham-fistedness, trying to achieve a high score.New guns are unlocked via experience points, which are effectively available infinitely, and with credits. A single credit is earned when you first reach the top spot in the leadboards for a gun. This means that there is a finite amount of credits to be had, and their spending should be well-considered.Of course, there's another way to get credits and EXP, and that's where the microtransactions come in. I've not personally done this, but you can buy credits and EXP for real money. It is not, however, necessary.As for the gameplay itself, it is for the most part fairly solid, though often overly particular about which bits can be taken off the gun at which point in time. Figuring this out is solely a matter of repetition, yet often a source of frustration. It's an incredibly grindy game, no two ways about it.And I, personally, adore it. After a while I decided I'd be a good little blighter and give the devs some money as a show of support, so I bought the car pack."

However it doesn't mean that the game is bad, it is really good for a free to play game. I can't understand the hate going around for the micro-transactions, but I guess that I didn't play the game enought to realise that yet.In overall I'm not going to place a '10/10' rating, instead I will list few good things :-It is fun to play for a certain amount of time (at least for me)-I like the option of uploading the skins you made on a specific gun instantly to the workshop-There are a lot of guns to 'play' with-In the workshop you can download people's own guns and perform the same actions, as with the in game one's.-This game is clearly made for people who like to grind (I like to do so, but as I mentioned not my type)Thank you for your attention!"

Its not reallly a game. I mean guns arent toys...Also bad guys/gals with a borked firearm may very well learn how to repair and service it...Let alone people using this for insight as to how to actually make working firearms...Leonardo Da Vinci would wet his pants over this.Can you please add his giant crossbow model :-)his mechanics for it essentially invented all the parts for a machine gun."
