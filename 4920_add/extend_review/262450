It would be awesome if they updated the game for multiplayer or at least put out a similarly priced sequel that includes it.Matches with real people would be a total blast with how fast and furious the action can get in this game. With the right draw no lead is safe.

If you can not take losing in a graceful way I would recommend skipping it.That said, Dead Man's Draw is a very polished card game with a decent learning curve and simple gameplay you can easily get the hang of. You can make a lot of combos with a lot of cards and you will probably have a few good hours with it.While it may seem the AI cheats, to this point I have not found it to do so. In fact, for a large part of the game the deck is stacked in your favour by giving you two traits at once while the AI has only one. The AI though is incredibly agressive, prefering to use cannons to blast your hand over potentially winning moves. This is quite annoying if you're just starting out, but often it leads to the AI impotently blasting away your 7 score card to reveal a 6 underneath, barely doing anything.The AI does not seem to be able to really understand the game, it's functional, but feels very much like it follows a flowchart rather than that it plays the game. All opponents are the same as well, all following the same AI.Luckily, where the AI does not change, the traits they use does, and the game has interesting ruleset changes after every 'tournament' (A string of a few matches) you play to keep things interesting.As much as it looks like it may be enjoyable with a friend, it does not have multiplayer at this point. To continue on with its flaws, the game needs you to play a lot to unlock things. To the point where it begins to feel like grinding, and that the randomness begins to get annoying after yet another loss to an AI using a trait that you haven't even unlocked yet.Is it polished, entertaining, and an interesting game?YesWorth 10 euro?I'd be sceptical. If you can find it on sale you're sure to get a few hours of amusement out of it, but otherwise it might be hard to get your money's worth."

Easy to learn, but that's not to say there aren't things to think about while playing. More strategy in playing your cards are added at the different challenges. And there are a lot of challenges to go through so there is always a reason to keep coming back to the game. The game is more based on luck of the draw than strategy but it's not all luck. You can also unlock abilities by completing challenges that you can use to make certain cards more powerful for your own style of play that you prefer. Up to two can be used after you unlock both ability slots.  Overall I recommend the game if you enjoy card games for sure."

In all honesty its about 40% luck 60% skill.The core game is based on 1v1 drawing from the same deck, once the deck is gone the player with the most points win. How do I earn points you ask? Well, let me tell you. There are 10 suits which have numbers on them 7 to 2. Each card in your hand adds to your point value. However only the highest card in each suit counts. Each suit has a specific ability once drawn which are slowly introduced and pretty easy to quickly grasp. But a few examples are the canon suit makes your opponent discard a card or the mystic suit allows you to see what card is next in the deck.You can pull as many cards from the deck as you want each turn unless you pull 2 of the same suit, then you bust and all the cards drawn are discarded. However further into the game there are modifiers that may change this function.There is no multi-player which is a little sad but its still very enjoyable against the AI. The game is also slightly RPGish in that you earn experience points even if you lose, though not as many. It'd be cool if it had some tech trees or something to tailor your own progression but you earn XP fast enough where that doesn't really matter. The games aren't very long either, probably 5-7 minutes if I had to guess. The XP earns you levels which at each level unlocks either a new character portrait or a character trait which is essentially an additional modifier to the core rules. Using the example from before, the mystic trait would change when the mystic card is active, it would reveal the next 3 cards in the deck rather than just 1. The other traits are similar in this fashion. Once multiple traits are unlocked you can choose from them before each match to attempt to thwart any rule changes that may make you play more defensively or cautious rather than an all out attack or risking a bust.The game is split into tournaments, each having their own modifiers on the core game as well as each opponent within having modifiers of their own. Which leads to what is a very simple game into something that keeps you on your toes and keeps you switching tactics to progress.THE GISTVery fun, enjoyable casual filler game that is easy to grasp but hard to master with a side of luck thrown in.

Don't be put off by the piratey theme of this game, I'm not such a fan either. there are lots of rules but each rule is introduced to you one by one so its easy to pick up. I have alot of games to play at the moment but I find myself putting more hours into this than anything else. despite its complexity I cannot fault this game. its not always easy but it is well balanced and extremely well thought out. I do however wonder why there isn't an option for local or online multiplayer because this would be a great game to play against other people but I guess the the point of this game might be to promote the fact that this game exists as an actual card game. if this is the case then they have suceeded because I assuming I can find a copy I will buy a deck."
76561198056978538,Recommended,262450,10611308,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,ChickieTeeta,"I really enjoyed this game, the rules are really simple to pick up, it's fun to play, the characters are memorable and consistent in 'who they are' with the trait combos they use. The AI is really good and not overly cheaty, there were a couple of times I thought you wouldn't keep drawing like that or you'd have had to have known that card was there to have carried on or to have played that card, but this didn't happen often enough to make it a concern. It is incredibly fair the majority of the time.Basically cards in your hand are banked, cards in the draw pile are the ones that you play with.There are 10 suits and each suit has a function.You're trying to beat the characters and usually you need a score of 65 at least on each game to get 3 stars on a tournament. (It will unlock the other tournaments on just one star though which just requires you to win each game with any score. I was going for the achievement which is why the 65 was important to me.)You play cards from the draw pile, if you get a duplicate suit you lose all the cards in play to the bust pile (unless your opponent has a trait that puts bust cards into their hand instead)Only the highest card from each suit is counted towards your score (although there are a couple of tournaments that count every card towards your score)* Anchors lock all previously played cards so you can't lose them* Hooks let you play a card from your hand* Clairvoyant lets you see what's next in the deck. (The mystic trait will allow you to view the next 3)* Swords lets you play a card from your opponent's hand as long as you don't already have the suit in your hand or currently           in play.* Chest combines with a key card to give you a selection of cards from the bust pile based on how many cards you drew that turn (or your ops hand if you have the plunderer trait. The treasure hunter trait will let you triple the amount of cards you get given)* Cannon makes you discard a card from your hand which goes to the bust pile, or you can take the misfire trait and you can discard a card from your ops hand instead....if you combine misfire with the scavenger trait, the card you blasted goes in to your hand.* Kraken makes you draw 2 cards to play so you can't choose to bank the cards you have until you've drawn them. If your op has the beastmaster trait you'll have to draw 4 cards.* Mermaid lets you replay a card currently in play....Sir Lovesword sometimes uses a trait that banks the card you replay (you can also unlock this trait)* Maps lets you take a card from the bust pile and put it in play. Ordinarily you get to choose between 3 cards, but the navigtator trait lets you pick from any card in the pile.You don't have to memorise the suits to play effectively, if you hover over a card it will say at the top of the screen what the suit does.There are loads of traits to choose from which you unlock as you level up (much more than the ones I've mentioned here) which allow you to manipulate how the suits work for you or against your op.You can choose 2 traits at a time to use.I completed the game with 3 stars on every tournament and I tended to stick with the misfire and scavenger traits. I only occasionally swapped one or both of these out for something else.Here's a tip if you're going for the 3 star achievements....you can only get 70 points in total (unless you're in the tournaments that count every card towards your score) and you normally need 65 points per game, so I played to get five 7's and the rest as sixes if I couldn't get 7's (obviously any extra 7's will allow you to have another suit at lower than 6 and still get the 65 points you need), all lower numbers are dross and can be gambled with. The cannons trait combo will let you steal the 7's you need from your opponents hand. There are a few times this trait combo doesn't work as well, or you'll find it's better to negate your opponents traits instead but for the most part this method worked brilliantly.There is no multiplayer, which doesn't bother me, I prefer single player games for the most part, this game would be great as   a multiplayer though.I bought Dead Man's Draw when it was on sale for around £1.64 but I think it's worth the £6.99 they normally ask for.Brilliant game, very easy to learn, simple to play yet there's loads to it :)"

The actual card game consists of equal parts strategy and luck. However, the better you are at the strategic element of the game, the less luck factors in. Especially if you choose your buffs well (once you have unlocked one and/or both slots available). You unlock different buffs as you rise in level and/or defeat certain ""levels"". Each level (or whatever) comprises of up to three battles (so far anyway, around 40 or so battles in (maybe 50), or hands if you will. Different ""enemies"" use different buffs as well, which can lead to some challenging battles. Overall, it's a fun game that you can play in small 15 minute chunks if you want, or play for hours at a time. This game is well suited to work around your schedule.Anyway, I defintely recommend at the recent sale price, but the full price is still a reasonable asking price.7 out of 10."

But if you EVER play the game on the same computer that someone else has played under even a different Steam account, you end up permanently sharing the same game. There is only one in-game profile, which can not be dleted easily [Seriously?], the game shares a common save file with all other players on a computer [who does that? i.e. not account based], and if it ever cloud synchs it overwrites them all.So if you have a seperate computer for each player and never play it on another computer, good to go.That all being said the game is so cool that my partner and I made a physical card deck verision of the game so we coudl play two player while we wait for the multiplayer option."

The game was so well-received that Mayday games (in conjunction with Stardock) made a physical version of the game that can be purchased at Amazon and other retailers.Dead Man's Draw is a pirate-themed  card game with an interesting rule-set that changes each game.  Each of the 10 suits has it's own unique 'ability'.  Additionally, players can choose up to two 'triats' each hand that invariably change the gameplay and adds to replay value.There are some things that the game could have done better.  The lack of multi-player is the biggest thing missing from the game.  Another thing that would have made the game even better would be a 'free-play' mode; the game is very structured -- which is great for learning the game -- but that 'structure' means that the game will decide who you play, in what order you play them, and any special rules for that particular game/hand.Dead Man's Draw is an entertaining card game that can be played for 5 minutes at a time or 5 hours at a time.

,Recommended,262450,9030751,"Posted: 9 February, 2014",all,Kejmur - AFK,"After hours and hours of playing this card game I need to say it's really well made. While I'm not a huge fan of pirate theme, it's still something I really enjoy playing and I don't think I'll ever get bored of it. For first I'll point out pros of this, because I need to point out few of them:A) Combination of really easy to learn mechanics combined with amount of strategies you may pull off with cards you have on your hand + traits. Traits is what make this so fun to play and yet allow you to be creative with your plays. Technically after tutorial you learn everything you need, while with each in-game tournament you learn new card combos and gain traits to use.B) The amount of gameplay which in-game tournaments provide you. Counting all cards when it goes to points ? No problem. You need to reach 50 points first ? Also in. You can't score more than 60 points while beating opponent in points ? In as well. The amount of possible modes to play in is just nice making each tournament pretty much different.C) Graphics and music are good combination here. For a simple game like this, I would say it fits really well.D) Still lots of room for improvements and new additions. The amount of cards is good, but not huge enough IMO to add few cards in-game without making it too complicated. There's also a possibility of new traits. In other words - this game has still more potential for improvement.E) Good AI which actually can not only count well (which is not as obvious in such games) but counter your strategies and eliminate/steal cards which are the main core of your strategy. I'm really happy with this as it makes game challenging.Although unfortunately I see few problems as well:A) Lack of multiplayer is outright unacceptable. I would really love to play this game against real players and outright test some traits and card combos against them, especially when this game has the perfect combination of simple mechanics and yet good amount of strategies and combos available to use. Please, do it. It's such a waste otherwise.B) Price is a bit too high for a card game like this, but I must admit I don't regret spending this money. But still, I would lower the price. Or I won't even bother mentioning this as a con as long as creators will add multiplayer option.C) While it is luck based (and I don't mind this, it adds additional thrill for example when one lucky pull saves you), but I think game favors AI a bit more than a player. But maybe that's me and I'm a bit biased. But still, you should still win more games than loose if you choose your cards and traits right.In other words I give this game 8/10 because of small cons and lack of multiplayer. I really recommend this game as it's fun, addicting and challenging, while you don't need to waste time learning complicated mechanics. I would give 9.5/10 with multiplayer, but without it - I can't. Still good buy and certainly not wasted money as long as you enjoy card games ;)."

Another game I wish I could give a neutral rating.Its a push your luck card drawing game with each suit triggering a different mechanism and along with your traits you can combine them in to more or less devestating attacks in order to collect cards that bolster your score.Contrary to some of the reviews Ive seen nothing to suggest that the AI is cheating, it does pull off some last minute nasty moves at times but keeping my cool I can think back to the many times I have done the same thing. How much this actually matters is debateable, if the game makes you feel like it is cheating then whether it is or it isnt, the frustration is always real. I think this will be the biggest sticking point for most people, at first it may not be quite so apparent but as things go on you will see through to the luck component of the game increasingly easily and more and more you will feel robbed by complete chance regardless of how well youve played a hand.The traits and the combination of traits can be fun to toy around with, but this leads to a scoring issue. The game considers high scores to be good, not a difference in score between you and your opponent. This means that the many aggressive tactics put you at a horrible disadvantage; even when winning regularly with your strategy if you have not defended your high score you will end up winning tournaments tens of points away from the three stars you are aiming for. Its kind of a punishment just for picking a style of play.You can unlock more and more traits as the game goes on, but also portraits which are quite dull. Id have preferred them just to stick to a lower level and give the portraits for free along side the traits.Each tournament has a set of rules, and some of them really shake up the game format, unfortunately they repeat the rule sets two or three times due to the huge number of tournaments there are. Again, I would have preferred fewer more focused tournaments, as the gameplay simply isnt varied enough to support the huge number of what are essentially the same games over and over. (60 tournaments in all, with about 3 games on average in each.) The tournament scores are also very harsh, some require you to be within 5 points of maximum score in each of 3 or 4 games, it can lead to _a lot_ of repetition. (Cards go from 2 to 7 so a single lost card is more than enough to bring about a failure.)and of course. A big issue for many, no multiplayer. I can understand this to a degree, they have a boardgame to sell as well, and this is about a third of the price of it, but the different use cases really should take care of this. A lot of people buy boardgames even when they have a digital version on an iPad or some such to hand. In fact there are plenty of people who play computer games who dont board game and vice versa.It seems that for every good thing in this game there is something that brings it back down or ends up making it tedious or frustrating.By and large, Im going to recommend it, its not that expensive and its fun enough. _Just_ fun enough though, not nearly as enjoyable as I think it could have been."

Basically.Game mechanics has two things that deserve attention: too much RNG based gameplay which in turn slowly but surely sours the gameplay once you put in more than a few hours. Every game is a RNG luck fest of defeating your opponent with trait Y who in turn uses X while rules Z are in effect..  Not bad - for awhile.... but the random feeling win-loose chains really dont make much sense after some time. You can't look back and say 'i should have done that hand differently.  You can - and must - put in some tactics to how you play but this far no specific strategies are winning strategies because of RNG.Buyer beware.

That's 2 cards of 7 that will cause a double and 5 cards that won't. Does it seem like you are playing those odds. Now add the 2 card doubles. This game also has tension builders that are not needed. You have to rush your discard pick because it moves right away. The computer's is figured before the graphics even shows but the screen pauses and slowly scolls like it is choosing at a relaxed pace. Creating what seems to be an unfair illusion because the computer does not need that relaxed pace. Now the ""Busted"" graphic does get old but it is also creating tension. First, you are being told repeatedly that you have failed. Next, clicking the mouse should remove it and the cards, starting the next hand. It doesn't work, you have to press the mouse a second time to remove the cards. Thus you try to match the timing of the double click or wait for ""busted"" to disappear on it's own. As that tension builds you are now button mashing thinking that will speed it up. One click should finish the process but they want that tension there. It helps the AI appear to be a tougher opponent. Actually the AI follows a pretty basic set of commands. In the end the Devs ruined the game by adding these things so I cannot recommend it."

Honeymoon: You love it. You are winning most games. You get half the achievements in 2 hours of play.Phase 2. Frustration: Now the games are evenly matched you each have 2 traits. Your opponent is better than you. They have a computer program that instantly calculates odds on inceasing the score risk. Now the rules change often and your AI opponet never forgets them. The AI has all the best card play sequences for every situation stored in its memory, you don't. You are still winning games, but you are losing 4 times as many.Phase 3. Resolution: Out of your frustration to proceed you look for a guide and read the forums. You learn about a bug that gives you an unfair advantage. It is merely an undocumented key board stroke. No 3rd party. You use it to slaughter your opponents now scoring huge wins. You feel elated and take revenge on the opponents that hve been consistently beating you.

There are 10 different card types in this card game, each card type has it's own unique abilities.  The game further allows you to equip two traits before each match in order to form a strategy going in that could best counter your opponent.Even though I gave this game a No recommendation, it doesn't mean that this game is bad.  It's can actually be quite fun at times.  The problem comes in when you put in more than 5 or 6 hours in the game.  The first bunch of matches were really fun, you were unlocking new card powers and then new traits to augment those card powers.  Each game felt really unique and it was fun to learn how each new power interacted with the ones you unlocked before it.  However the tedium started to set in after about 6 or so hours of play into the game.  Unlocks became very slow and instead of cool new traits now you were getting cosmetic hero potraits which further slowed getting new traits.The game does try to combat some of that tedium by introducing a different set of table/map rules for the matches as you further progress into the game.  And yes the first time you play those rules it again brings you back into the game.  Instead of just having more banked points/gold than your opponent you have to beat him and have less than a certain number of points/gold, or instead of just counting the highest point value cards in your hand it counts total value of all cards currently held (which can get kind of crazy with some of the traits that you or the AI can have).  But once again the tedium sets in.  Once you've played through the rule sets twice, it's no longer that fun and combined the fact that you've progressed so far in the game and nothing else has really changed each match feels more like the ones before it and there doesn't feel like a really big need to keep playingAnd then there is some randomness that needs mentioing.  The randomness is mostly contained to only the drawing of cards.  After the draw is done based on how the cards interact with each other and the traits you can equip you can control the randomness of the drawing a fair bit by comboing cards together.  However that still wont' stop you from drawing a key and drawing a second key and busting your turn without being able to do anything.Lastly since this is against the AI only, I'll mention that the AI isn't exactly the most polished.  They do make some questionable moves at times while at other times pull off perfect combos and that inconsistancy can add some not needed frustration on top of game that kind of feels like it's to long.I'll finish up with saying that I'm not giving this game the thumbs down because it's bad.  It's not a bad game, it's actually quite well done and the card mechanics are quite fun.  It's just that I can't recommend it to everyone, it's a very niche game and for someone looking maybe to kill 10-20 minutes here and there it can be fun but playing for longer times in one sitting shows the weaknesses the game has."

,Not Recommended,262450,18210229,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,genoforprez,"Far, far too luck-based for my taste. I'm not opposed to certain types of randomness in games (especially card games) as far as the initial dealing of the cards, but once you play your cards, they should be played. Dead Man's Draw doesn't feel that way, though.It's essentially just regular old ""War"" where you and your opponent draw cards and whoever draws the highest card wins, but DMD just puts off the score tally until the end and has you ""test your luck"" each around by drawing additional cards and trying not to bust. Essentially, it is a combination of blackjack and war.What I don't like about it, though, is that the game is overflowing with random occurrences of upsets and reversals. Imagine blackjack or war where every number between 1 and 10 has a special effect, where if you draw that number, a certain thing will happen every time you draw that number, no matter what. This goes for both you and your opponent. Drawing a 1 reveals the next card to be dealt (note: it doesn't give you the OPTION to look at it; it just shows you). Drawing a 2 forces you to remove a high-scoring card from your opponent's discard pile, dropping their points. Drawing a 2 and a 3 on the same turn automatically doubles your score for this round. Drawing a 5 forces you to steal any card from your opponent's discard pile. As these effects are turned on, they can be chained together into combos by you or your opponent. Draw a 5 and steal a 1 from your opponent (lowering their score), which allows you to see that the next card is a 2 and won't bust you, which you draw (raising your score) and use to destroy another one of your  opponent's cards (lowering their score). When you are chaining these combos, it feels like ""strategy"", but the only reason you got to perform this combo was luck (you happened to draw a 5), and deciding which card you are going to steal or destroy is a bit of a no-brainer. So it is a very shallow sort of strategy as far as I can tell.The net result of every drawn card having some kind of game-upsetting effect is that even when you score points, you can't count on the fact that you simply scored those points. Your opponent will randomly draw a huge combo opportunity on the next turn and drop your points from 50 to 10 while raising his points from 7 to 48. The score upheavals and reversals can be so random and large, it's enough to give you whiplash.Ultimately what this game feels like is if the game gave you and your opponent each a bag full of random effects, and each turn you both randomly draw an effect out of the bag, which makes some random stuff happen, and then one of you ends up having more points than the other. Whoever that turns out to be is the winner. End game.Also, the game has the most superficial and meaningless use of XP I have ever seen. I don't know why it is in there. For a feature brag, I assume.The art is great, though. The game looks and sounds fantastic. The test-your-luck blackjack element is a great aspect of the game and probably my favorite thing about it (and the gameplay element that persuaded me to give the game a try). Unfortunately, the torrent of forced upheaval effects on the cards just turns the whole thing sour for me. It feels like a game of interesting decisions getting overruled by a steady torrent of RNG interruptions, which just turns me off."

The deck consists of 10 suits of cards numbered 2 through 7, and your simple goal is to get the highest single card of each suit you can, with lower-ranked cards you collect functioning as backup for when (not if) your top card gets stolen.Each suit has a special ability tied ingeniously to its thematic element.  For example, swords allow you to steal and play a card from your opponent's hand, while anchors ""lock down"" all previous card in the current play to protect them from a bust. (A bust occurs if you draw a second card of an already-played suit in the same turn.)The artword could not be better, and there are tons of special abilities (""traits"") to unlock.  Achievements are gained by playing a series of tournaments using special rulesets (e.g., ""Swords and cannons target the lowest card of a suit instead of the highest"").

You form hands by taking turns drawing from a deck, each turn ending when you/AI collect the cards drawn, or bust by uncovering two cards of the same suit.  When the deck is depleted, the round is over and the winner is the player who has the better hand.There you have it.  If that sounds interesting, go ahead, but that's all you'll be getting.Sure, there are special card abilities and other razz-a-matazz to make the game seem more interesting but those don't change the fact that it's basically a simplistic luck-based game with a little bit of decision-making thrown in to make it seem like your skill factors into it.Good graphics, good presentation, good user interface and reasonably smart AI, yet stupid enough to make conspicuously bone-headed decisions, which breaks immersion.Maybe I've played too many card games in my life, or maybe I've programmed too many, but this game doesn't offer me what I want which is a skill-based card game with a little luck thrown in.

You are, however, at the mercy of the draw and at times you just can't catch a break.The opponent AI makes intelligent moves and overall I'm satisfied with the time-waster challenge that DWD provides.  Trait customization (player card modifiers) along with several game variants provide for a good variety of game experiences.The only thing missing is multiplayer.  It's a shame that the developer has moved on to other projects, because I think that DLC or a sequel could prove quite profitable.  Player versus Player is a very appealing amenity these days.

Even then sometimes winning is about playing the last draws really well.Edit: After some time, I've played this off and on and I find that overall I'm pleased with the game the more I casually play it.

Unfortunately, as time has gone on, other complaints have replaced this one, even if they're not QUITE enough to merit another thumbs-down. I'll detail them here so that buyers can make an informed choice. If you'd like details on how the game actually plays, the descriptions and some other reviews/threads should give you the gist.Needless to say, the lack of multiplayer is one gaping flaw, although it should be noted that a good chunk of the player abilities would have to be disabled or revamped for this to work, since some of them do too much to cancel out others to make for consistently balanced matches. And there's no point allowing players to see each other's selections beforehand, since this would just lead to a cyclical bout of power-switching as they keep trying to counteract the other's selections. Still, doing this would make multiplayer perfectly doable.The next complaint is that there is an incredible need for some kind of counter or image to give the player at least some idea of how many cards are currently in the discard pile, which is currently off-screen. Some players can apparently keep track of this mentally without disrupting their experience, but the rest of us often have no idea what to expect once the pile starts to get low, and when choosing whether to take from the discard pile or do something else, it would be nice to be able to tell whether there were many - or even any - cards in the pile altogether.And the final gripe is that, as much as people dismiss the mere suggestion, I think there is some genuine unfairness in the AI's knowledge of the draw deck. I don't think it's deliberate stacking or cheating, but rather a partial failure to partition what the AI SHOULD know (i.e., nothing) from what it actually does. I base this on the sheer number and proportion of cases in which the AI will take unreasonably high risks (namely drawing when it already has four, five, or even six cards on the table and the chance of a bust is high, even though there is nothing protecting most or all of the current cards from loss in the event of a bust) only to be rewarded with exactly the right card or even succession of cards it needs to get the most out of its current hand. I understand the effects of luck, but this particular bit of grand (and situationally specific) ""fortune"" has played out a few too many times for me to be satisfied with that explanation. Combine this with the AI's being generally aware of what's in the discard pile (unlike the player), and there are times when what should have been a fair bout turns into an infuriating, unbroken string of losses for a perfectly completent player. Now, to be fair, the program does sometimes make less-than-efficient or even self-defeating plays thanks to other holes in the programming, and luck does indeed play its role in all cases, so this doesn't really break the game. But it sure makes for a less enjoyable experience than it might have been.Still, for a cheap, renewable diversion, you could do worse."

This was an obsession on the level of something like Teris or Puzzle Quest. That equated mix opf luck and skill that just keeps pulling at you to do more, play more, unlock more, win more.Is it hard? Not at all. You can figure it out in about 6.5 minutes give or take 30 seconds and once you've gotten it you question if it'll be fun to play. Then you play a few more game and you are solidly invested into unlocking characters and abilities like it's in a time constraint. But it's not. The game is so simple it's almost laughable how much time I put into unlocking everything.The game is a simple card draw with the general rule of negating all cards drawn if you have two of the same face cards or numbers depending on the game. Every game lasts for a few minutes. A tournament is several games with a simple overarching rule such as: first player to X points wins, player with most cards at end of deck wins, player with lowest score wins. These ensure you tweak your character's abilities and playstyle to win consistently. Sometimes you lose solely out of bad luck but sometimes it may be a bad pairing of abilities that simply doesn't jive with the tournament rules.I think it's only worth a few dollars and that makes sense for what you get. Graphics are nothing amazing. Sound is kind of corny. I usually play this while listening to some sort of podcast on YouTube (Tested, Google Talks). All in all its worth the money.

Dead man's draw uses basic mechanics of drawing and adds on several layers of complexity which makes the game much more strategic than luck based. It requires you to think through thoroughly before you try to test your luck.What i like about the game is that it makes me want to buy the analog version of this game to challenge my friends in real life as compared to fighting against AI, granted that the AI is indeed very challenging.The graphics and music also helps to add on to theme that this game is going for and it feels like a game pirates would play when they are not playing liars dice"

I would agree on how this game 50% luck and 50% skill so don't be surprised when you start off doing very well and get destroyed by the AI in the last few draws in the deck.  The pirate themed game play is also pretty interesting with cool art and card abilities.  As you play the campaign, card abilities will unlock and game play modes will change as you beat given challenges.   I say if you like card games in general this would definitely be worth a try and i guess it can also be somewhat comparable to Blizzard's Hearthstone card game."

It is fun to play, but with no multiplayer and a cheating computer player..... it becomes frustrating and boring fast.   3 out of 5 stars  You will want to keep playing but will soon realize its a dead end you're cruising down."
,Recommended,262450,18731755,"Posted: 28 October, 2015",all,Jonman[GWJ],"Dead Man's Draw is a slick and polished head-to-head card game, played against an AI opponent. The rule-set is initially very simple, with more rules and features introduced as the player progresses, providing a smooth introduction to the finer points of playing the game.As with many card games, luck plays an enormous factor in your success or failure, but there is also a significant degree of skill that can be applied to influence the outcome of a game.A single round of the game takes only a minute or two, meaning that this is an excellent ""filler game"" for when you only have 5 minutes to play something quickly. That said, there's a reasonably long campaign-style progression, which continually offers new opponents with various abilities and tweaks to the rules to keep things interesting over many hours of gameplay, and it's easy to get sucked into ""one more round"".Overall, it's a splendid little game."

,Not Recommended,262450,18583010,"Posted: 20 October, 2015",all,TriTraTrouble,"Initially, this was a thumbs up review...In the beginning, I was very impressed with this game. It's a bit complicated to understand the mechanics, but once you got an idea of how everything works together and what combos are possible, it starts to get really entertaining. BUT: DMD gets frustrating in late game. Reason? The AI is balanced in early ~, but I'd prefer it if they failed drawing as much cards as I do. No matter what I do, AI always gets the needed card to win on the river. Made me uninstall it, because it really makes no sense to play when anything I do is getting countered on the last card. Tried for like 100 times. 100 times last card win.Call it bad luck? Maybe. I call dips on bad balancing."

Its pirate theme is fun and gives the game a bit of an edge.The game starts off very basic, with each subsequent level adding functionality to the card suits (canons blow up cards, fortune tellers reveal cards, etc.) and eventually game mechanics (this round canons blow up YOUR cards). It keeps the game engaging and fun and JUST under the barrier of being too difficult.It's a fun, fast paced, challenging game that is sure to keep you entertained."

76561198029766083,Recommended,262450,35310924,Posted: 29 September,all,gesh123,"One of those games that is simple to learn, with relatively few rules, but as with any decent actual playing card game has enough strategy that you feel like your skill can beat out luck over time.  I also like that the ""tutorial"" is really built into the main part of the game via a process of unlocking more features early.  As you progress, you unlock more features that adds to the complexity a bit as a pace that doesn't get ahead of your learning curve.  For different ""rounds"" they also throw in temporary variations such as having your computer opponent have a special skill that alters the rules somewhat, etc.Overall, a very fun game that will leave you satisfied whether you play for 10 minutes or a couple hours."
