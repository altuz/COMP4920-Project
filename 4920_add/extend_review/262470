As far as I can tell (I'm just about an hour in right now), the storyline is pretty much stock fantasy, but I wouldn't come to a game like this looking for complex moral judgements and deep allegories for our time. The characters are all fully voiced, and the acting is pretty good. The character art is fantastic. The level designs are easy on the eyes as well.Considering the price vs. the amount of fun to be had in this game, Rollers of the Realm is a pretty good buy.On another note, I'm finding the gameplay somewhat reminiscent of Wizorb - if you've played this game, RotR is probably right up your alley as well."
,Recommended,262470,21372281,"Posted: 21 February, 2016",all,LadyOberon [#GamersRule],"Rollers of the Realm is the most unique game I've played in years. The concept is what originally caught my attention. A combination of pinball and RPG elements, how is that going to work? Well, it probably shouldn't, but in this case it does.The quirky pinball characters are unique and even funny. There's great replayability here, too, as you'll need to decide which character, or ball, is best suited to a task, considering width, height, weight, and special abilities, like healing, increased damage, or special attacks.The graphics are beautiful, and the controls are responsive. There is a challenge to some of these areas and puzzles, too, so experienced pinball players and puzzle enthusiasts should find plenty to appreciate here.It's evident that a lot of time and attention went into the detail for the characters, environment, clothing, speech, and story. The outcome is a very consistent experience that's easy to get into and enjoyable. Gamers of all ages should consider giving ROTR a try.One thing that I want to point out is that there is an interruption in flow as new goals are met or characters are introduced for the first time, and that can seem awkward at first. However, that interruption is part of the story and RPG aspect of the game, so it's definitely necessary, and it's easy to get used to. Afterward, the pinball gameplay is uninterrupted, and players can revisit areas to obtain loot or treasure they might have missed, without repeating the story. This is certainly not a negative, but it is something I noticed that others are very likely to experience. It was awkward for me at first, and I wondered if I was going to be able to enjoy the pinballing aspect of the game. I hung with it, though, and soon that wasn't even a consideration.I'm fascinated by this game, and I applaud the developers for taking such a bold risk by pairing these gaming elements into one cohesive experience. I intend to play this game again, and I hope to see more."
,Not Recommended,262470,34520154,Posted: 26 August,all,Bumblebugbee3,"Virtual pinball games have been around for a while but this one presents a big twist on the genre.  Rollers of the Realm is a story-based pinball game with light rpg elements.  Instead of just playing a handful of tables to get high-scores you instead have to knock enemies around and navigate oddly shaped levels.  There is voice-acted dialog across multiple stages making this quite an adventure.  Being the first of its kind its clear the developers struggled to get everything right.  Lets looks at both the ups and downs on this bumpy road.The story in this game is really driven by the character and environments.  Although some of the banter between the characters is quite amusing the story overall isn't very memorable.  You start out playing as a young girl and her dog.  The dog gets kidnapped and the girl convinces an old knight to help her save the animal.  They quickly get dragged into helping stop a plot to resurrect three ancient warriors that once had the power to rule the realm.  You're journey will have you fighting through the streets, the woods, and layers of a large keep as your adventure unfolds.The pinball inspired gameplay is the most fascinating part of this experience.  Once you launch the ball you not only control what is often multiple flippers but you can also, to some extent, control the direction of the ball.  There are puzzles and treasure chests that force you to open certain flippers and navigate the ball over different ledges.  Many times you'll be forced to cut down hordes of enemies which you can damage by hitting with your ball.  The ball will just bounce off of most enemies while tougher foes will hit the ball towards the flippers therefore forcing the player to react quickly or lose that character.  Some enemies will damage (shrink) your flippers making it considerably harder to catch the ball until you bring out your healer or find a potion.Magic is generated by smashing objects or bouncing off of bumpers.  You can use your magic for special attacks or to revive fallen characters.  Once you have lost all your characters the mission is considered failed.  Each characters takes the form of different size balls with certain attributes and special powers.  Some characters have small/faster balls while other have bigger/strong balls.  You can buy each character different equipment to improve their stats or enhance their powers.  Some of the powers activate multi-balls while others offer different means of attack or extra damage.  Many characters like the alchemist and archer also have passive attacks that shoot from their ball.This really is a neat concept and it is certainly not a terrible game but it is also quite lacking and unpolished.  The first half of the game is quite exciting as you unlock new characters and enjoy the different styles of missions.  However, as you progress farther the game quickly ramps up in difficulty.  It is really quite annoying once your flippers become shrunk from damage to find yourself launching one ball after another just to see it slip though the huge gap between the flippers.  I made it up to the last mission but wasn't interested in grinding for the gold needed to upgrade all my characters.  If I had to say if this if this is worth playing I'd tell fans of both pinball and rpgs to check it out.  However, it would be really hard to recommend to anyone who just enjoys one of those two things."
,Recommended,262470,13033649,"Posted: 21 November, 2014",all,GameDragonZero,"Rollers of the Realm is one of those games that seems to be based on a dare.  ""What if we combined an RPG with a Pinball game,"" which needless to say is a rare thing to see in games  Much like Puzzle question and other fusion games before it, pinball or no, the real question is ""does the fusiion work?""The short form?  Rather well.Rollers of The Realm has the characters represented as balls. Some are small and fast,others big and slow.  Some are easy to put ""tilt"" on, some can't be redirected so easily.  All of them have a unique special ability.  Surprisingly, this works, and allows you to develop a lot of strategies, and solve puzzles by . . . forgive me . . . juggling the right balls.The game is as such - go to an area, enter a board.  There you can find all sorts of things you have to deal with to win -  enemies to attack, obstacles to overcome, puzzles to figure out environments to navigates, and other challenges to face.  Ramming a character into an enemy attacks it.  Striking some objects raises mana to use special abilities.  Some characters can even derive mana or gold from some targets in the field.  And there are seemingly inaccessible areas that you can get to with the right combination of characters, wits, and flipper-usage.  There are also keys to find and treasures to unlock.By the way, characters who exit the field often die (until ressurected) and flippers can be damanged.  So you don't always have time to just sit there and try things over and over, and losing a ball can be very traumatic to your strategy.Surprisingly it works - it's a pinball puzzler with some resource management and combat-like elements - and, of course, boss monsters.  It also allows for bite-sized play as any one board doesn't take very long, and they can be revisited for more loot and exploration.At it's core, it's pretty clever, but there's also an actual plot and character backstory.  Nothing epic, but it adds to the game as characters have motivations you understand - and as this is a game that is representing characters as colorful spheres, kind of needed.  The voice acting is decent to good, and thankfully lacks overdramatic elements - plus the characters sometimes make witty remarks during play that provide more atmosphere.The game does lack in a few areas - character status screens are minimal and special abilities aren't always well explained.  Font choices on status screens are also a bit tough to read.  A few boards are rather dull or their layots not always clear.  Documentation is virtually nonexistent (even though, yes, it's basically RPG Pinball, so its a bit simple).However, these are minimal criticism in that, for $9.99 American you get an excellent fusion RPG that makes its seemingly insane premise work well, nicely done visuals and character portrayals, and enjoyable pinball puzzles to solve.  A precice game that delivers exactly what is promises, does it well, and throws in some surprises.A definite buy for fans of unusual RPGs and game mechanic experiments, and something to consider for a gift for people with a taste for the unusual."

I pick it up, poke it 'til most of the fun comes out, and move on to other work or play. Most of the time, I don't really feel like a game would be worth reviewing--I'd either be one of the many, or I wouldn't be able to review it in a positive manner.Rollers of the Realm made me rethink this, for 2 major reasons. Now, I'm a pessimist at heart, so I'll start with the lesser reason first:This is not a long game. Normally, I wouldn't have an issue with this in an indie game for $10, but I draw the line here. I'm just beginning to feel like I know what's the what in the game, only to discover my playthrough is over 90% complete, and I STILL don't know what the handy hired help skills do. So let this be an illustration: the amount of gameplay here is small, but the depth is huge. They set out for RPinballG, and they succeeded. Clever/smooth mechanics, and they succeeded. Graphics that don't leave you frustrated halfway through with mind numbing repetition? success.Now, why is being short an issue to me if this game has so much going for it? It's actually because of Reason #2: The levels, the gameplay, every second of my first playthrough of this game was one thing: exquisite (okay...there might've been a little corny voice acting...but what fantasy game doesn't have it?), and lo and behold, I go back to see some of the unique levels/scenarios again, but find them to be locked (all bosses except the final ones can only be defeated once each playthrough). In case I haven't been clear: I want the story to go on, I'm actually interested in these characters which aren't just cookie-cut archetypes. I'm interested in a puzzle that challenges my MIND, instead of my reflexes...(some of them were close), but most of all, it seems like Phantom Compass mastered the mechanics they wanted to use, applied them well, but hasn't gotten to use everything in its bag'o'tricks yet.--Eagerly awaiting DLC/Sequel!"

Unfortunately,  I don't think this game is going to make pinball fans or those looking for an RPG happy.For starters, there's just not much there in terms of what you'd expect from an RPG. You can buy some upgrades that make very little difference to how the individual balls perform, and you cand spend a bunch of gold on buying another party member. That's about all. It's very thin if you're looking for any kind of character customization, which could be forgiven if the other aspect of the game - the pinball - was stellar.It isn't. This game's idea of a good pinball table seems to be stationary targets that you have to hit over and over - and over and over- and when you finally ""kill"" one, another comes out to stand in the exact same place. Instead of interesting shots and modes like you'd expect in any real pinball table, you get to bounce off these targets a few inches from the flippers again and again. Honestly, the weakest tables in Pinball FX are more entertaining.Like I said, I like the concept. I hope either these developers or someone else gets to take another crack at it, and before they do I hope they play some better pinball tables."

This is one of those games, and it does it very well. I've been fond of Pokemon Pinball since its launch, and I never saw any other game try to do something special with pinball (ok, there was Odama, but let's forget about it).Each of your balls represents a character and has its own abilities. Some are fast but deals almost no damage, some can heal your flippers, some are great at destroying objects, etc. You can switch between them, but when you lose a ball, this character dies (it can be revived, but basically this is your reserve of balls for a mission).The game is very short (I played it on easy and beat it in 2 hours), but you can always replay missions. This way, you can level up, unlock new characters and buy them better equipments. Seriously, I can't believe I'm talking about a pinball game right now.The level design is awesome, and it manages to convey a feeling of variety and novelty even though you're always playing the same pinball game. Awesome."
,Recommended,262470,13355775,"Posted: 13 December, 2014",all,Tacroy,"This is a great game, but wow is there a gigantic difficulty spike at the very end. They've added a checkpointing system to alleviate it, but the last boss is justinsanecompared to the rest of the game.See, for most levels you're able to use any of your characters, because they all have different uses. In the last stage though, there's a series of three different levels, each with three boss enemies - and onlyoneof your characters is capable of dealing significant damage to them.For the first two bosses, that's fine; you just clear out the board a bit, then pull out the special character and poke them until they die. If your special character dies, it's no big deal; you can just gather mana with someone else and revive them. It's not fast, but you make consistent progress.For the third boss, though, you just can'tdothat. This boss has two special attacks: he does something which causes a lot of damage, and he does something else that drains your mana.This means that instead of the normal repertoire of six or seven characters, you've only got three that matter: the healer, who restores your health; the ranger, who is immune to mana drain; and the special character, who's the only one that can significantly hurt the boss.If any one of those three dies, you're boned. Healer's gone? Well, you're going to take a lot of damage, which means you're more likely to lose another character. Special character dies? Now you're playing catchup, because the person who does the next-highest damage to the boss deals 1/5th the damage. Ranger dies? You might as well give up. You're going to have a really hard time building up enough mana to restore another character, because there's no mana charms on this stage and to reach the mana gathering spots you need to go around the boss.And going anywherenearthe boss is super dangerous - if you ever make the mistake of hitting him head on, he smacks your character with a friggin Chaos Dunk and they go flying straight into the middle gutter. It's really, really hard to recover from that.Overall though, this is a great game - it's just a pity the difficulty went from Super Mario World to Dark Souls over the course of one boss."

It's a fun, unique, and interesting game.The boards are fun and complex always with multiple flippers on each side.Each might have different goals like some you might need to use the Thief ball to bump into the backs of peasants to collect some gold, others (quite a few) you defeat enemies, or you might need to make it to a different part of the board as part of the story.The characters being represented by balls of different size and materials works well. They feel and play diferent, so where the small almost-too-fast Thief does a ton of damage from behind (much less from the front) and gets knocked around by the flippers easlily, the Knight is big, slow, heavy, does a fair bit of damage from any angle and can occasionally knock down enemies briefly. Meanwhile there's also the Ranger who pasively fires arrows when near enemies, or the Farmhand who wrecks objects and knocks over enemies easily.All of the characters (balls) have an activate-able ability. The thief has an extra ball in play (her dog), the Knight blocks the balls from going down between the flippers for a short time. The character/balls can also be upgraded at the Port (a shop) buy buying them. Some may increase damage, lessen the special ability mana cost, modify their special in some way - usually making it stronger and/or last longer.On a personal note: My favorite has to be the Barmaid, a hire-able side character who's good all around and can be upgraded to be able to heal the flippers on mana gain when her special is active which happens to make her more agile and do more damage to begin with.""Not the kind o' spoonin' you were expectin'?""There is some limited bad, however, in that several stages feel SUPER frustrating because there's too many enemies crowding the flippers so all your balls bounce off of them and in the hole. Perhaps the Farmhand is the character I was supposed to hire first so he could bowl through them.As of yet, if you use a controller with vibration there's no way in game options to turn off the rumble so some stages I needed to take a break until my hands stopped being numb."

If you like pinball then it's definitely worth a look.As a weak to middling pinball player who still enjoys pinball games, the great thing about this game is that progressing through the levels actually provides a sense of achievement, instead of trying to beat your own score vainly trying to complete the minor objectives of a regular pinball table.The RPG elements are well done - each ball/character has a specific use and it's nice to be able to build up the capabilities of the ones that fit my playing style.The way that combat works on the tables is neat. Approaching enemies create a real sense of impending doom because they drastically increase the likelihood that you'll drain your ball, but you also need to worry about archers damaging your flippers, so you need to juggle your targets and characters.The major downside of this game is the balance often feels a little off - trick shots don't feel like they're very tricky, or otherwise simple levels feel like they're nearly impossible."

The levels (I think there is like 30+ of them) are very simple and dont have any nice combo features you are looking for in any competetive pinball game. ""Pinball FX 2 Epic Quest table"" is in different league of what you will find here. There is no real incentive to play the levels except to complete them for the story purposes.  I wish that the level design had bit more focus on what makes good pinball games good; comboing loops, landing those skillshots, getting that intensive ""pinball fever"" going on. Most of the times this game actually feels more of an Arkanoid with pinball flippers.Still, due to very good idea of combining rpg elements and story structure with pinball, the game manages to entertain and was a pleasant little game which you can play just to relax and for its short duration, it wont get boring either. The game just manages to be better than the sum of its parts, and original idea games like this are always welcome."

It's just lovely to see a creative pinball-based game after so long.This one mixes in a little bit of RPG elements, but not an awful lot, and strictly nothing you have to pay too much attention to. It's all about making the ball go where it needs to go, and there's a story to go with it. The story is nice, if not terribly original, and the characters are charming. Around the pinball tables are different kinds of stationary targets that award ""mana"" to use with special powers, moving/attacking enemy targets that block paths and attack your flippers, piles of money, chests and corresponding keys. The tables are varied and often consist of several playfields. Oh, and you can swap between different balls (RPG characters) that are of various sizes and other properties, and special powers that ranges from reviving to setting enemies on fire or launch additional balls into play. You can also directly affect left/right movement of the ball to get into difficult spots.The game is perhaps a bit short, with gameplay of about 4-5 hours or more (on casual difficulty) depending on your skill and how much time you want to spend on collecting money for upgrades. On the other hand, I've played shorter games that were a lot less satisfying. The game ran surprisingly well on the fairly low-end hardware I was using at the time, but in a couple of levels the performance was noticably worse than average. It's probably not an issue for newer/better hardware. The game supports Xbox 360 compatible gamepads out of the box, so I chose to go that route.Not much to complain about. It was a game I enjoyed, and will warmly recommend, at least on sale. I just hope they add some additional DLC content or a sequel, because I'll likely buy it!"

After you beat the first couple of easy levels, go back and re do them a bunch of times for more gold and it really starts to sink in.  This game would probably work better with a game pad or controller; I'm mashing keys on a keyboard.TL;DR version: if you like RPGs and Pinball, just buy this thing."

But instead of the standard bouncing off bumpers and hitting targets, you will be bouncing off the scenery, hitting enemies and plundering loot.What could be just a cute skin on a pinball game turns out to be rather more than that though. For one thing the levels are a lot less complex than what many newer pinball games are like, but what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in variety. Throughout the game you'll be traversing ""tables"" on the theme of caves, castles, forests and cities. Sometimes even multiple things in the same table with some nifty transitions.The different characters are different balls, instead of being just a reskin though, they differ in abilities. The knight is a larger than regular ball, but he does a good deal of damage to enemies and obstacles he hits. The rogue however does very little damage (unless you manage to hit from behind of course), but is very agile. Agility is handled in game by being able to veer the ball left or right. The agility score of a character determines how effective this is. You can actually roll the rogue up slopes after some upgrades if you really want to.I've mentioned combat a few times now, and that's because most of the levels will focus on either hitting an objective or two, or killing all the enemies before proceeding. Apart from being able to knock your ball away, enemies can also damage your flippers, causing them to grow shorter and shorter if you let damage stack up. Some characters will be able to heal them however. This means you'll be trying to find the right character to attack with, and swapping to a healer once in a while when your flippers are getting dangerously short.Swapping characters is as simple as holding a ball in one of your main flippers and pressing the swap key to cycle through your available characters. Should a character die (down the drain marked by a skull), you'll have to play with another one until you've gathered up enough mana to resurrect a characters. There's a good deal of them, and yet in the later levels I've found death coming so swift I've had to restart a map on more than one occasion.The storyline of the game is nothing too impressive, but they've managed to at least give a sense of purpose to why you're in the map you are, and why you must achieve the goal of the map. Generally they're well voice acted, though one or two characters have had a few lines which felt not quite as well acted.My biggest problem/gripe with the game going in was that it looked to be rather short, packing in 6 chapters (unless this ""final chapter"" is a ruse and there's a bunch more). Regardless I've enjoyed the time I've played the game, and at €10 it's hard to expect more. This is a game I could see myself buying expansion DLC for if it became available.Pros:* Rather unique, not many other games have mixed pinball with combat and quests in this way* Good looking colourful graphics.* Runs well, I've yet to encounter any actually problematic technical issues, even on my modest notebook. (edit: It seems some integrated graphics chips has some texture issues, my system running throttled at 1ghz dual core and intel HD 4000 worked smoothly)* Controls well, what with the agility and the amount of flippers on the tables and fairly good physics, you rarely feel you're losing because of sloppy controls or bad physics.* It's cheap, always a good thingCons:* Nearing the end combat might feel like it's getting a bit repetetive* Length, it doesn't seem like the longest of games, but for the price it doesn't feel too short either."

Let's begin with some of the positives. It has some good voice acting, and an interesting design overall. Who wouldn't be stoked for an RPG pinball game? The RPG elements are incorporated into the playfields (more on that in a moment), and the idea is interesting.I don't believe the execution was very good however. To begin with the most glaring issue, the controller support is awful, and feels terrible. A patch was issued so that some players not using Xbox style controllers could even play, but even with my 360 and Xbox one controller it still plays poorly. The menus feel horrible with a controller, there is no 'dead' zone, so the selection is bouncing all over the screen. On top of this there is a mechanic where you can select party members once in the game. This mechanic again suffers from the lack of dead zone. So you're trying to swap characters with a quick flick on the stick, and you just keep bypassing them in the list, hoping that you'll make it there eventually. There are also unbound keys by default, so only the flippers and launcher/special ability button work on a controller. Consumables cannot be used straight out of the box.Once you get past the less than stellar controls, there are the mechanics themselves. You have some control over the ball when it is moving in regards to shifting its motion left or right. This is not done via bumping the table, but direct control on the ball which was extremely odd to me. After getting to the third area I've realized why they did this, and it's the biggest failing of the game. Almost every single level turns into a shooting gallery where you are attacking characters that stand in the middle of the playfield. There are three main types I've encountered: Guys that throw things/shoot arrows at your flippers, guys with shields you can only hit from behind, and guys with swords (sometimes with large healthbars), that try to knock your ball out. I wouldn't mind this if it wasn't the main mechanic for all but a few scant bonus levels but it happens all the time, and sometimes there are multiple waves of these enemies. It turns into 'get up around the side, try to cheese it by bouncing around on top of a guy using ball control, hope you do enough damage to kill them'. It's a poor design decision that leads me to believe they were unable to come up with more unique mechanics and tables that would enable such mechanics.This frustration and boredom of the tables continues due to the size of most tables, they're very small, sometimes there are a few screens worth of areas, but often times those sections repeat mechanics. Additionally there are issues where special character abilities don't work, for example the knight character can block the main area between the flippers so you don't drain the ball, but the ball can bounce AROUND this area, and still drain, totally defeating the purpose of his special ability.When looking at this game in a vacuum it might seem okay, but when you compare the mechanics here against older games in this genre, or even Zen Pinball tables, you can get more bang for your buck with a single table than I've played so far here (almost completed 3/6 chapters).The physics feel bad and floaty, the tables repeat WAY too many of the same objectives (hit this thing, kill those guys), and it just doesn't feel great, especially with the poor controller support, which to me would have been essential for this sort of game.I can't recommend Rollers of the Realm even on a sale, if you enjoy pinball you're not going to enjoy this game, it's boring, repetitive, and not challenging in a way that feels rewarding."

Each of your party members is a ball with different properties such as size, damage, maneuverability, and healing which can be augmented by earned items.  The physics of the boards feel like an old wooden version of pinball, which can take getting used to, especially when your ball gets hit in a way that tosses it over the board's obstacles.Each party member (all very well-voiced!) has a special ability which can be triggered when enough mana is collected from the boards.  Boards often take less than five minutes to beat and range from the interesting to the absurdly simple, with the player having to get their ball into a specific area or defeat a specific enemy to pass.  I think I would have enjoyed a board or two that could be played endlessly like classic pinball after the main quests were beaten.  Story mode will take about 5 hours to complete on a straight plathrough but there is little reason to return to the game afterwards.I love some of the puzzle aspects that shine through the duller filler boards, especially those which encourage (but don't require) the player to switch between different characters to finish a board more easily.  Unfortunately, these are more uncommon than not, but it illustrates the potential of the concept."

I like pinball games a lot and I'm a huge fan of the RPG genre so when I had an opportunity to play a demo of this game at Momocon I was intrigued. When I saw it discounted during Steam's Summer Sale I bit.I don't regret this purchase, and I don't think I would even at the current listed price of $9.99.  Rollers of the Realm is a fun combination of both pinball and RPG. The characters were enjoyable and the storylline was simple and not terribly original, but honestly better than what I expected from a pinball RPG.The game play was usually enjoyable. I say usually, because the level design is pretty inconsistent and some levels are far less fun than others. There is an art to designing a good pinball table. One which the designers didn't study too hard because they hit upon the basics of a good table rarely enough that I suspect the better tables were more accidental than deliberate.  Only a few are actually awful, but the majority of tables are just kind of ""Meh."" They're mostly very simplistic and don't have much variety to them. Pinball machines tend to be hella elaborate.Some characters are more fun than others as well, with half my roster comprised of characters that I never used unless all the cooler characters died.Which brings me to my biggest complaint about the game. Because enemies damage your flippers pretty quickly later in the game, I was required to play the Healer far more than I would have liked to. While there's a few other characters that can heal the flippers, the Healer is really the only one that can do it well enough to be worthwhile.  This greatly reduced my ability to play the other characters and really frustrated me since the Healer doesn't even have any fun abilities to use while playing her. No multi-balls, no ranged attacks.Minor annoyances were the game being fairly miserly with gold and a sequences of levels that without warning locks you out of grinding the previous levels for more gold and experience until you beat them (with a x3 annoyance multiplier when combined with the fact that when you lose a level you don't get to keep anything from them).Ultimately, this is a fun and fairly unique game that could have been much, much better with some better design choices. It's worth playing in its own right, but I dearly hope either a sequel or knock off comes along and improves on the formula."

Rogue steals money, etc.)The game is fun.  It has a good story.  The only con is the infinitely-respawning vermin in the game can get really annoying, especially if your hunter is dead."

,Recommended,262470,13266092,"Posted: 7 December, 2014",all,hockeyhacker97,"Let me start by saying on real pinball tables I always prefered the older tables where you could control the launch via how far you pulled back the spring, and the buttons for the flippers you could somewhat control how hard you hit the ball, when tables switched over to the push button to launch and the flippers felt less controllable I didn't care for them. And that is how most all computer pinball games have felt to me, like they have all had the basic concept of pinball but lacking that feel and control of older pinball tables.Does this feel like pinball of old? No, not at all, but it does feel really good. It contols smooth, the tables (or level's have you) all feel interesting, and its all around a good feeling game with some interesting mechanics to help it feel fun to control, unlike most digital tables and newer pinball tables.Giving the game some RPG like mechanics is an interesting twist, and I enjoy the different abaliities the different classes have and how you switch between them. I think the only real negitive thing I have to say about this game is that the buying upgrades to make your classes stronger to ""fight"" harder enemies feels purely like a way to make people go back and play older tables again to grind some gold to add how long it takes to complete all the tables.  While it does give reason to play tables more then once as you go through the story it also makes previous tables more trivial as you get more and more stat upgrades, so it is kind of a double edge sword of forcing replaying slightly old tables while at the same time reducing the reason to play even older tables.Adding RPG elements into a game just to add RPG elements can often end up being bad, but in this case it feels pretty good with how the different classes feel and what they do, its almost as if someone looked at Runespell :Overture and went ""hey turning poker into a RPG when done right can feel really good, lets see if we can turn pinball into a RPG in a similar fation to Runespell Overture"", and it worked out, it doesn't feel like a mechanic tacked on to have a  gimick, it feels like a legitimit mechanic with a purpose in the game to make it feel more enjoyable to play.With that said, if you even slightly liked older pinball tables, or like the concept of digital pinball but don't like how most of them you don't feel like you have any real control, definitly give this one a shot.  At no point have I had a point where my death has felt like a ""quarter eater mechanic"" of having no control of the outcome, every death has felt like I just mis played it... And yes that is how I feel about older pinball machines compaired to newer ones, the older ones gave you better control, but as arcades started going away and as the fewer people playing pinball got better, they changed their controls to be ""quarter eaters"" much like how older video games where designed to have cheap deaths to eat quarters, on older tables I could play a single ball and earn extra balls for longer then all 3 balls of newer tables."
