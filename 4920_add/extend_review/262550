,Recommended,262550,8543856,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,Twistor,"Here's a review after finishing the game with both the main characters and trying the third, hidden one.TL:DR? Challenging 20 levels of platforming with wild west style. Like Megaman, if you're familiar with those.Gunman Clive is a short but challenging platformer of minimalistic but nevertheless adequate graphics. There are three playable characters, one of which you have to unlock, each with their special skills. There are about 20 levels, every 5th of which is a boss battle. They take you through the wild west and the story hilariously hyperboles towards the end.Levels are sidescrolling action that last only a minute or so per stage. However, they're also quite challenging, requiring multiple tries to get through. Bosses have anywhere from 2 to 4 different attack types. Challenge rises from the low health of the player who can take only two hits before dying (on Hard difficulty) and also from death falls and insta-kill spikes of certain levels. Obviously, once you get familiar with the game it becomes a lot easier to avoid enemies and go through the previously difficult spots. Warning though if you're easily irritated, you might get momentarily frustrated with some spots.After a while the game begins to resemble very much the Megaman games of NES. While you have infinite ammo, your rate of fire is limited by your weapon. Many features of the levels from enemies to obstacles also resemble Megaman, from moving platforms to appearing and disappearing blocks to alternating gravity and wind machines. Admittedly, these features are part of virtually any decent platformer, which this one certainly is. There are also a couple of special levels with slightly different moving capabilities akin to Gradius (continuosly moving, sidescrolling shooter) and just about any sidescroller with rideable minecarts.I hope I'm not spoiling too much if I reveal that the third character is unlocked after finishing the game first and isa duck that can't attack, only fly short distances. This game mode is also a bit more difficult because of these limitations. Because of this there are alsono bosses in this mode for obvious reasonsand it is basically a different game altogether. This mode is very challenging to complete perfectly, adding several hours of play time to the game.For such a small price this is a good platformer, maybe even too cheap for its content, for now it's like on a permanent discount. I hear it has been first released on 3DS, now rereleased on Steam with achievements. These are of the speed-run, no-damage run types with different characters. They can be quite difficult, though you can do the no-damage and speed-runs separately. The most difficult one is the one requiring completion of the game without dying. There are two versions of this achievement, one for the initial characters and another, probably more difficult one forthe duck. I have yet to get all the achievements.Some people seem to have become upset because of some ""misogynistic content"". Myself, I found this concern hilarious. You can play either as the guy or the girl and save the other one. This is the incentive for the story. It isn't very original but the story isn't exactly the reason to play this game: it works splendidly for what it is."

,Recommended,262550,8546173,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,Polly,"There's not much more one can say about Gunman Clive other than that it's a fairly simple, two-button arcade-length action platformer with a fun little western presentation. There's a pretty good variety in terms of enemy designs, stage gimmicks and layouts, and boss enemies, and a decent selection of randomly dropped gun power-ups from enemies to mix things up here and there. Replay value lies solely in the Steam Achievements and personal satisfaction if that's your thing, and are aimed more toward hardcore goals such as finishing stages under par-times, without dying, and under certain circumstances which can only be unlocked by completing the game once.What Gunman Clive presents is utterly simple, but it's executed well enough to bet that you'll have a pretty good time with it if you're into older-school games like Contra and Mega Man.  You could really do a lot worse for the couple bucks this one's going for."
,Recommended,262550,8555662,"Posted: 4 January, 2014",all,xenofoxx,"Gunman Clive is a throwback to the old NES Mega Man games. In fact I often joke that Clive might have been Dr. Light's great great great grandfather.The game is indeed short, but the price for such a short game is fitting.Some may not like the coloring of the game, but I think it was a style choice given the old west theme. It didn't seem to bother me, but I'm sure some would disagree."
,Recommended,262550,17097849,"Posted: 17 July, 2015",all,Big Tuna,"In the year 20XX, a former employee of Capcom shows his previous employers how to properly honor one of their own franchises as well as a truly great era of gaming, all while keeping the price tag under $2. Enter Gunman Clive.Gameplay:Alright, well the game isn't ENTIRELY based around Mega Man style gameplay, more-so of its level design. The levels feel very reminiscent of Capcom's classic series, and were a joy to platform through; though there were a few levels that changed things up, such as a minecart level (Donkey Kong Country here) and a shooter level somewhat similar to that of Gradius. Otherwise, it sticks to the solid jumping and shooting formula of games past and executes it well. A couple mechanics here and there could have been explored further, such as the destructible bridges, which were only in one level.  Also, the controls were also pretty responsive and translated well onto the keyboard, they are also rebindable.Where the differences from Mega Man really appear are the weapons. The weapons operate on a system more akin to the Contra series, where you can find upgrades for your basic gun that give it a new ability. Examples would be the classic spread shot, a slow explosive shot, to even a wall-piercing laser as well as a few others; like Contra, these are lost upon taking a hit. One change to these is that how you get them is a little randomized; some are static within a level, some you can get by chance from killing an enemy. The enemies also vary from generic bandits, to ducks and seagulls, to even some strange otherworldly enemies. The bosses are also a little more similar to something like Contra rather than Mega Man, as you don't end up absorbing their abilities or anything of the like, and also aren't all exactly memorable.Unlike Contra, however, you can take multiple hits without dying and have unlimited lives. The amount of hits you can take is dependent on the difficulty level selected. The hit detection in the game is pretty well done and I hardly ever felt I got any “cheap” deaths. There are also somewhat randomized cakes (similar to the random-ish weapons) that replenish your health. Speaking of health, one minor complaint is while the health UI is simple and non-intrusive, it only really gives you a general sense of how many hits you can take before death, rather than something more clear.Also on the topic of UI, sadly, for you speedrunners and achievement hunters, there is no restart button on the pause menu; so if you know messed up on getting the ""Star"" time for that level or a ""No Damage"" run, you must either kill yourself (contributing to your death count) or exit the game and re-select that level. Another minor annoyance, but said speedrunning and achievements honestly kept my game time from being longer than about an hour.One good thing for you guys is the helpful timer at the top of the screen for getting those pesky “Star” times. However, a nitpick as it may be, I wish there was an option to turn this off. This wish isn’t to benefit me or other achievement hunters, but to those who don’t care about those kinds of things and who just want to spend an hour to play through the game and not have to feel some sort of false pressure of a ticking clock. Otherwise it’s much more helpful than hurtful for replayability, it would just be nice to have the option to opt-out of it.Speaking of replayability, there are two extra modes, one where you play as the damsel-in-distress herself, Ms. Johnson, with her ability to float (Super Mario Bros. 2 here); as well as a humorous Duck Mode in which you play a defenseless duck with the ability to fly upwards for a short bit. These feature a few more achievements on top of Clive's own No Death, Time-Trial, and No Damage ones. These alone probably increased my play time by four-fold and were pretty enjoyable.Graphics:To quote the game's trailer, the game features ""Weird Artsy-Looking 3D Graphics"", which is more or less true. As you can see, it has an interesting sketch-book like aesthetic on top of the dominant western theme. Personally, the lack of color was not an issue for me, due to the game's length; and towards the later levels, while the continued use of brown could be seen as lazy, I felt it made the levels a little more surreal. In general, the model quality and animations were done pretty well too.As an added bonus to being on PC, we also get 1080p 60fps gameplay as well as some super-sampling, making this the definitive version in regards to graphics (unless you want the 3D effect of the 3DS.)One very small detail used in the game's graphics was how objects that did have color bled a little color through the outlines or weren’t completely filled in, especially when the screen was moving. This was a cool trick to make the game bare resemblance to a water-painting, again re-emphasizing the whole ""Artsy-Looking"" theme. There were probably some other tricks used that even I didn't pick up on.And an even smaller detail about the graphics (that may not even be on purpose), and I'm probably only one to make this comparison, but to me at least, sometimes when Clive dies or gets hit, the pose he makes bears some resemblance to the death screen of Zelda II. It could just be me, but as supportive evidence, you eventually fight what appears to be a ""dark"" version of Clive himself, much similar to the final boss of Zelda II. Ironically, he is very easy, unlike in the NES game.Sound:The music more or less fits the western style of the game, and gives it a bit more atmosphere. The tracks generally range from ""okay"" to ""pretty good"" to easily sum them up. Also, toward the end levels, the music begins to become a bit more chiptune-like, similar to that of the games inspired by it. The music is also composed by the creator’s brother, so this is not an entirely one-man effort.Story:Clive himself is a man of few words, none at all actually. With a tagline like ""In the year 18XX"", you pretty much know what you're in for on a story level. Kill the bandits, shoot some ducks, save the girl, become a duck. It's simple and it works.There is a possibility that there is a little more at play than what the story is on paper, such as how pretty much all of the stores are suspiciously owned by Mayor Johnson and named after him, but that could just be me trying to bring meaning to something meaningless.Now to the biggest overall complaint about the game: the length. I myself finished my first run through on Normal at around an hour. Then my first run without dying was about 16 minutes. The game is not heavy on content, more-so on replayability, but what is there is well-crafted and polished.And while its own trailer makes self-deprecating remarks such as ""A Generic Old School Side-Scroller"" with ""Lots of Brown"", this doesn't mean it is not well executed and that brown isn't put to damn good use."

Music is very generic and seems like it was composed using Nokia 3310 sound sample library. Sound effects belong to an old NES space shooter;* Enemies.

Same thing as with enemies. Restore your health by eating a slice of birthday cake. Why not beer, tabacco or anything else that should belong in a wild west based game.

,Recommended,262550,13205157,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,iN008,"Gunman Clive is a beautifully simplistic platformer with a futuristic wild west setting featuring charming sketch like visuals and an absolute superb soundtrack. Tight controls that feel precise matched with fair platforming creates an enjoyable experience. New elements are introduced every level, however some are gimmicks only appearing in their respective levels, due to this it should also be noted whilst playing the duck some of these gimmicks feel like a hindrance to endure. It is very reminiscent of Megaman and Donkey Kong Country as many levels feel similar to those I have played in the aforementioned games. However whilst the game is great, there are some issues; Difficulty only changes how many health/hits you can take whereas I feel the game would benefit more if it were to modify the levels and enemies in a way to increase the challenge.Indeed the game is short, say 2 hours for your first run of each character combined, I wouldn't necessarily say it gets repetitive, each character handled slightly differently, where Clive was the standard all-round character, Ms. Johnston played a lot like Peach in the sense her floaty jump has an extended reach. The duck was by far the most enjoyable to play for me, it was more challenging due to the fact you had to avoid enemies rather than confront them. I definitely recommend this to everyone from casual players to platformer fanatics."
,Recommended,262550,21388441,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,Audish,"What I've learned over the years is that how a game feels is key to its success. People will put up with a stiff or janky game for all sorts of reasons, but you generally don't have to coax them into sticking with a game that simply feels right. Gunman Clive is just such a game, one that is completely familiar and welcoming from the moment you start it. It's such a fine fit, in fact, that you may be surprised at how much you miss it when it's over.You play as the aforementioned Gunman Clive on a platforming quest to save his sweetheart... or vice-versa, if you're feeling particularly progressive. Clive can take a few more hits but Ms. Johnson can float SMB2-princess-style, which is always a pleasure in a platformer. No matter the gender you'll be armed with a trusty pistol that can lay down three shots on the screen at a time. Most enemies can be dispatched with one or two shots, and sometimes they're nice enough to drop additional weapons like spread shots, explosive bullets, and piercing beams.There are sixteen levels spread across four areas, with each level serving as a one- to two-minute scene. Some will take you some practice, especially once they start adding gimmicks like moving platforms, vanishing platforms, fans, zappers, and so on. The further in you get, the more the levels will remind you of classic Mega Man gauntlets, which seem to be the chief inspiration for the game. The music follows suit, a collection of gentle, twangy riffs on 8-bit-era tracks. The graphics are even more beautiful in motion, animated with a simple, sketchy flair more distinct than most platformers manage.Gunman Clive won't last you too long on a single playthrough, but there's a hilarious third character and a hard mode that lives up to its name to tackle once you beat it. Considering how charming, challenging, and just plain fun it is, you really can't pass this one up. It's Mega Man platforming with Contra weapons that looks great, sounds great, and controls like a dream. What's not to love?Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

There's some shooting involved but mostly it's just running and jumping through short levels (about 1-2 minutes long if you do it perfectly) with a boss battle after about 5 levels or so. I think that there are about 20 levels (about 1 hour of playtime), but my memory is so terrible I can't even remember.I love the art style, it's nothing short of amazing, if only a little colorless.In all honesty, I was hoping for game like the brilliant Sunset Riders (look it up !), but this will do nicely I guess. But if you want a true wild west shooter stick with the superb Call Of Juarez Gunslinger.Since it's only a few bucks you can't really go wrong with this game.

It's a well made game which takes a lot of ideas from megaman but also has many own. It can get frustrating at points and make you wish it had checkpoints, because you start over at the beginning of the level every time you die. But the levels are short and bosses are on their separate levels so it's not too big of a deal. There's a lot of variety in enemies and gameplay and it introduces new guns to you now and then.It's a very pretty game but can get a bit irritating on the eyes after a while because of the limited color scheme. Make sure you don't sit too close to the screen while playing and take a few breaks if needed. It's challenging and at times tricky game but not impossible.

I haven't played platformers much since about 1991, when the platformers of the time, with their extreme precision jumps and shots, never varying even an iota, created a feeling of a Holy Grail Quest that lasted long into the night. Now the term ""platformer"" is VERY different, with things like FPS platformers. Say WHAT!?Gunman Clive. First off, I paid 99 CENTS for it, mainly because of the art. That and the incongruous images on the Store Page. Cowboys and space flight?! Sure, why not when the possibilities of that concept are nearly endless. The idea of cowboys firing ray guns from hover platforms is hard to turn one's back on, especially with such AMAZING, yet simple, art. And then one starts to play....The right hand moves, the left jumps and shoots (so far, at least on a keyboard.) That's all you need to know. Part of the reason I now avoid platformers is some physical issues. This is not a ""jumping"" game. THANK YOU! Yes, you jump, and some are quite precise, but not while shooting, and flipping. while cooking an omlet and reading Moby♥♥♥♥♥♥ But that's not what this game's really about. The jumps are generally harder to MISS than to achieve. A player starts by searching for a kidnapped farmer's daughter, or some such, as either a cowboy named Gunman Clive. (Why not the more aliterative ""Cowboy Clive"" is a mystery) or a ""Ms. Johnson"", presumably the victim's mother. (VERY nice touch. I rather more enjoy the female character, with her dress-induced mincing steps, and her frequent floating to the ground, as result of said dress inflating.) A player has a choice of 3 skill levels. I haven't tried the hardest, but it seems as though the difference in the first two is mostly the amount of life one has. It's just you and you trusty 1,000 shooter. (Or some such.) You're attacked by cowboys, wolves, bunnies, ducks... Yes, ducks, too low to the ground to shoot. Usually. Sometimes shooting something results in ""birthday cake"" health, which shrinks in size and finally vanishes if you don't reach it in time. Or (naturally!) one of a selection of ray guns. Unfortunately, the ray gun is as hard to hold onto as it is (usually) valuable in battle.It's true (at least for me) that some sections between save points must be played dozens of times. While this might be a dealbreaker in some games, not with Clive. Things change. A cowboy with a gun before now throws dynamites(sic), and he's GOOD! But maybe shooting him will produce a piece of cake or a ray gun. Nothing is ever exactly the same, but similar enough to encourage progress with most attemps. The differences are certainly enough to keep the game from getting boring, or excessively frustrating. The good news about achievements: GC has them. The bad news: you aren't likely to see any of them.Hopefully this review will grow with time. I've not gotten far yet, primarily on middle skill level. If you'll excuse me, I really MUST get back to the game...."

First off, the $2 price tag is a really low price for this game. The only real problem I had with it were the controls, which I expiremented with and made less akward. Not to say the controls are terrible, in fact, many people will have no problem with it, as they feel arcadeish. I am just used to standard fps controls. Overall the game is nice. It has a very nice graphics style, as you can see from the trailers. One more problem I had with it, which is no big deal since it really doesn't affect gameplay much, is the enemies. Some of them shoot randomly at nothing, duck behind cover for a few seconds, and pop back up to do it again and again. But that's just nit-picking. I do like this game and it is definately a brilliant example of indie games."

,Recommended,262550,30042325,Posted: 19 February,all,Maki,"Gunman Clive is a charming Mega Man-style action game with a zany, unexpected sense of humor.  For $2, you can't go wrong.One of the things I love about Gunman Clive is how it taps into an often-overlooked value of retro games: replayability.  Mega Man was a great way to kill an hour or two.  You could beat the game and feel satisfied.  Games have gotten longer over the years and, likewise, platformers have too.  And while I'd never begrudge something like Shovel Knight for its length, it does lack that pick-up-and-play appeal after finishing it.  It feels like a commitment - to unlock the stages, to buy the items and upgrades, to fight the various minibosses, and so on.Gunman Clive cuts right to the chase and I admire it for that reason.  It's just the right length, has a surprising number of gameplay variations to keep you hooked, and multiple reasons to replay it.  There's no ""fluff.""  You came here for some fun platforming challenges and things to shoot and Gunman Clive delivers exactly that.Across 16 levels set to wistful and catchy Western-themed music, Clive can run, jump and fire his six-shooter to the left or right.  As in Mega Man, you can only have 3 bullets on screen at once, but this changes based on your power-ups.  Enemies often drop these, including a spread shot, a single powerful bullet, homing shots and more.  You keep these power-ups until you get hit.  On Normal difficulty, Clive can take 4 hits.  Cake, randomly dropped by enemies, restores health.  If you perish, you restart at the beginning of the level, but lives are infinite.  While a couple levels can get irritating because of restarts, none are so long that it gets frustrating.  The difficulty curve is balanced and gentle.Clive's goal is to rescue Miss Johnson, the Mayor's daughter.  In a fun twist, you have the option of playing as Miss Johnson and rescuing Clive.  Johnson has more air time, but cannot shoot while moving.  There's a third character you unlock at the end, who carries no weapon, and serves as yet another challenge to play again.Did I mention it's $2?  Go buy it, now!"

It really gave me a Mega Man vibe with how some of the stags were set up along with it's soundtrack. This game isn't exactly going to win any awards for revolutionizing the genre, but for the price, it was really worth it for me. If you go into this game like you spend $15 or $20 on it you're probably going to be disappointed.There are around 5 different weapon power-ups to use throughout the game, though you lose the upgrade the moment you take damage. All the stages take around 45 - 90 seconds to beat without dying with boss fights taking place after  4 stages I believe. Dying on a stage takes you all the way back to the beginning. It's really not as frustrating as people make it out to be. Like I said before, the stages take no time to be. The game allows you to play as three different characters and after beating the games the achievements will keep you going for a few hours more if you're really into the game.If you're looking for a quick nostalgia fix then this game might be right up your ally. Definitely pick it up on discount or in a bundle if you think it's too much now."

This does add some variety to this otherwise uninspiring adventure. I may also warn you: this is not for people who get frustrated easily. Classic gamers are more likely to enjoy it. Is it worth the $2? Depends on what you're expecting in this experience. It's a short little adventure, taking only about 40 minutes to beat, but it's packed with potential replayability.

76561197983662248,Recommended,262550,11348105,"Posted: 21 July, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it once too often made the reviews too long to submit, I've decided to leave it on my Backloggery page. Not that this review should push the length limit, but I'd like to stay consistent.Gameplay: It's hard not to look at this game and think, ""Oh hey, a Megaman-esque game."" You really wouldn't be wrong thinking that, either. It's also got a little bit of Contra/Probotector in it, with weapons that you can pick up throughout the levels and lose once you get hit. As far as the levels go, they've got a pretty Megaman-ish feel to them, although the game sometimes hops onto the Donkey Kong Country train. When it does, it's not exactly subtle about it, either. There's a minecart stage and there's the ladder-enemy-avoidance-thing from Vulture Culture. It's not bad, but it does feel pretty uninspired whenever these sections roll up.In fact, the most original feeling levels are the ones at the very beginning. Now, even some of the less inspired levels do make good use of the design mechanics... sometimes. For example, there's a really neat jump you've gotta do in the Gravity Man stage that makes clever use of momentum. Even though they may not always be the most inspired, the levels are still pretty fun to play. As for the enemies and bosses, there's a pretty good variety of enemies, if once again some of them are blatant ripoffs of Megaman enemies (the five-way turrets, for example). The bosses - of which there are four - are all pretty fun to fight.You can play as three different characters: Clive, the man protagonist; Ms. Johnson, the not-man protagonist, and a duck, the not-hu-man protagonist. Clive and Ms. Johnson play pretty similarly, with Clive being the hardier of the two while Ms. Johnson has a better jump as well as having a hover. The duck, oddly enough, was the most fun to play as. Since you are a duck, you can't fire a gun. As such, the game becomes about avoiding enemies. This does force you to look at the stages in a different manner, allowing for some pretty neat twists on level design. Of course, since you are a duck and cannot fight things, bosses have been removed.Overall, I had a pretty good time with this game. My current playtime of 1.8 hours reflects my playthrough of the game as the three individual characters. I normally consider a $1/Hour of Gameplay to be an ideal value for a game, and this game certainly delivered that. It may not always have the most original level design, but it's still pretty fun nonetheless. 7/10.Story: Sometimes you are a man rescuing a lady. Sometimes you are a lady rescuing a man. Sometimes you are a duck rescuing... I dunno. Anyways, the story ain't the focus of the game, or even a major element, so I'm leaving it out of the scoring.Graphics: The main draw of this game, almost certainly. I'm sure I don't really need to tell you that this game looks utterly fantastic, so I won't even bother. You've got eyes. The game does have a bit of an issue with alt-tabbing when in fullscreen (throwing an error along the lines of ""A Shader has failed to compile""). The one time I alt-tabbed out of fullscreen I didn't bother to check whether the game still worked or not. Anyways, this isn't too big of a detriment. You can choose your resolution, and the game otherwise worked perfectly fine for me. 5/5.Sound: The music sure is good in this game. You can get the OST by doing a little directory digging in the files of the game (/SteamApps/common/GunmanClive/data/sound, and the music will be the .oggs). As far as the sound design, I found it a bit lacking. Hitting enemies just doesn't have the punchiness I would've liked. It just makes things feel a little flat. Apart from that, there really isn't much else to talk about. The music is great, but the sound direction could've had a little bit more. 4/5.Overall scores are: 7/0/5/4; cumulative score of 8.0/10. I'd say it's worth the $2, definitely. If it's ever on sale for any reason, it's definitely a steal."

,Recommended,262550,8711656,"Posted: 14 January, 2014",all,Bonkleton,"Gunman Clive is one of those games that many might think is just another derp smartphone sidescroller (this was an Android/iOS game first), but once you get into it you see a higher level of quality. With each successive platform release of this title (Desura first, then Mobile, then 3DS, then Steam) it has improved on each port, and the Steam version is certainly the cream of the crop, despite how good the stereoscopy looks on the 3DS. The artistic effects are tuned to perfection on this release, looking completely awesome in HD, yet still maintaining the sketchbook cartoon look. The Desura release had responsiveness issues which have been cleaned up in this version, and just like in the 3DS version, there's three playable characters for you to use, adding replay value.That isn't to say this game isn't worth playing over and over again with just Clive. The levels are fun and challenging, and while they start off like an old west shooter, they quickly evolve into a crazy, off-the-wall platforming adventure. Runaway minecarts evoke Donkey Kong Country. Floating platforms recall Super Mario Everything. Boss designs recall familiar characters and franchises, but are clever and charming in their own right.  At one point aliens invade and steal your damsel in distress. In the second level there's a Portal-esque sign with a silhouette figure and an arrow pointing toward the end of the level. The simple jump-and-shoot formula works a treat, although there are times I would have preferred to have the ability to shoot upwards. The boss fights themselves are fast-paced and tricky, but just like older games, a simple attack pattern and basic AI is all you need to worry about.The game is short, which is a bit of a disappointment, but it is fun enough to keep playing off and on for a while. Plus, at two bucks regardless of platform, you really don't have much to lose purchasing Gunman Clive."

This was a real standout game on the nintendo store and it still holds up on the PC. First of all I'm very surprised by how good this game looks on a monitor with the art style looking just as good as ever. It looks as though it has been sketched out with constant movement even in motionless objects somewhat similar to the A-ha Take On Me video. What you really want to know however is if this game is any good or not.It plays almost identically to early Megaman games. You jump, sometimes you shoot, pretty self explanatory but the main thing jump and shoot games need to have is very tight controls and this delivers. You never really feel like a death is cheap as damage is always avoidable with quick reactions. The game itself can be quite challenging at times but this is a good thing. After a death you get straight back into the action starting at the beginning of the level almost immediately making you want to keep going to complete that final level.So for the game length my first play through on the 3DS took me just under 2hours or so but I can see this being much shorter if you're not terrible like me. So for the replayability there are 2 additional characters along with Clive himself. Ms. Johnson has a slightly different mechanic in that she can float in her jumps allowing you to do some little extra tricks but mostly the same kind of gameplay. However the third character is the Duck which is hilarious to play as and surprisingly saftisfying as you have no attack and must avoid all enemy contact (which means a few of the levels are skipped as they would be impossible to do). Along with the additional characters there are also awards for taking no damage in a level and also for speedrunning it which are for nothing more than bragging rights and steam achievements but give you something else to aim for.All in all the amount of content in this game and how good it feels is more than enough to warrant the small price tag. I'm just glad I got to support this developer twice with my purchase as there is so much potential. So if you're a fan of the Megaman series (specifically 2) or you just want a classic feeling jump and shoot game I cannot recommend this to you enough. There is so much character to this game you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not playing it!"

,Recommended,262550,15675749,"Posted: 3 May, 2015",all,Chicken Enchiladas,"A Gentleman Gamer's Review of ""Gunman Clive,"" developed by “Hörberg Productions”Introduction:- Gunman Clive is a 2D, action platformer in tune with the Mega Man games (i.e. Jump and Shoot)  to give an example. However, GC (Gunman Clive) adds a Western/Steam Punk twist to the beloved genre.Plot Summary:- It is 18XX, you are a gunman named Clive (hence the title) and are tasked to rescue the Mayor's daughter/your love interes, Ms. Johnson, from bandits that have kidnapped her; however, there is an other wordly influence to this crime. You must jump and shoot your way throug platforms, enemies and bosses with your cowboy, gunslinger abilities!Presentation:- The first thing to catch your eye in GC is its unique art style. It is stylized in a sketch artstyle; this somehow enhances the spaghetti western feel due to it making it seem more vintage and stylized. The use of differents shades of brown screams the west. Secondly, the music is what you would expect in a western. The music fits the mood perfectly; at times, it is very reminiscent to some of Mega Man's soundtrack, giving it a high octane feel. Genre and setting truly mesh well together; being a cowboy and all it just makes sense.Gameplay & Mechanics:- GC offers some variety to its gameplay. From the beginning, as it is custom gaming etiquette, you are allowed to choose your difficulty; however, you can choose to play as Clive or Ms. Johnson (more options unlocked upon finishing the game). They differ from gameplay. Clive is faster and can run and gun; whereas, Ms. Johnson cannot but can float decend slowly; very much like Peach's float ability from Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA). The layout of the levels feel like a mixture of Mega Man and Metal Slug level design (so I can make a point of reference). There are enemies in cover and you can take cover as well. You must do platforming challenges; the infamous knockback deaths are present in this action platformer; however, it is not as intrusive as in other Nintendo classics. Unlike the Blue Bomber (Mega Man), you acquire power ups via random drops and they are only temporary. The game itself is fairly challenging but nothing too difficult. Unfortunately, its on the short side, paying homage to other classic games.Final Thoughts:- As I look over my experience of this game, it was rather enjoyable. Eventhough, its rather short (I was able to beat the game for my first time under a hour), I picked it up again literally after I have just finished it to rank the levels and try out the other characters. If you asked me if it has replayability, its a definite yes from me. If the length concerns you, the low price is more than justifiable (especially because I bought it on sale when the game is already so low priced). Gunman Clive is the perfect homage to NES Megaman games and classic games in general. Had lots of fun; I'm sure you will too.PS:- If you'd enjoyed this game like I did, I would have you know that there is a recent sequel on 3DS. Hopefully, it will get ported to PC like this one"

,Recommended,262550,17411492,"Posted: 6 August, 2015",all,SharkFanFTW,"Gunman Clive. The first thing you notice is the price tag. This game is so cheap that if you plan on buying it, there's actually no point in waiting until it comes on sale, if it even does. Now, if any of you have played Bad Rats, you might suspect that the price is an indicator of the quality of the game, and with good reason. But trust me when I say that this game gives you incredible value for the money and is a bargain any day. Gunman Clive is a good-ol' fashioned 2D sidescrolling action-platformer. Appearently, Bertil Hörberg was a former developer at Capcom, and as such, the game is all about shooting the bad guys, like in a certain other Capcom game, but this time in a Wild West-setting. The story is a classic one: you're the hero, the girl's been kidnapped, save her. But for those of you who like a little girl-power, such as myself, it is actually possible to play as the girl aswell, and then the roles are switched. And if you're both a pacifist and an animal-lover, this is the game for you: get someone to play it through for you, and then you unlock duck-mode, which gives you the possibilty to flap through the stages as a helpless duck. Definitely an original concept. The artstyle is really unique and fine to look at, and actually gives the game a pretty genuine Wild West-feel. I guess it has something to do with all the beige in the background. The music is very good, although not the kind that gets stuck in your head and that you would listen to on your phone together with your Bee Gees (the best band to ever Bee (get it?)), but never the less it fits the mood of the game excellently. And the gameplay, of course, is spot on. There is a good enemy and level design variation, and the game gets progressively more difficult towards the end. However, the game consists of only 20 pretty short stages, and I, who in no way am a videogame pro and who died countless times, finished the game in only one and a half hour. I actually like short games, so this was my cup of tea, but there are still nine tough-as-nails achievments for you hardcore platformer junkies out there, not to mention three playable characters and three difficulty levels. So if you're tempted to trying this game out, grab your Xbox-controller and go get 'em, cowboy/cowgirl!9/10"

Unlockable characters and fiendishly difficult achievements have kept me coming back to play the game long after first finishing the story. For example, with a flourish of subversive humour, the game allows you to change the roles of the gunman and the ""damsel in distress"" after the first play-through.

Don't let the $2 price tag scare you off; it's well worth double that.This is a short little jump and shoot platformer (ala Mega Man) with similarities to other classic platformers like Super Mario Bros 3 and Zelda II. Playing as the female character is much akin to play as Peach (or ""Toadstool"" back then) in Super Mario Bros 2 as she has a ""floating"" jump. And duck mode is just hillarious as you play the same game as pacifist duck!Again, Gunman Clive is a short little platformer game with a charming little sketchbook art style and catchy western-like music. It probably won't take you more than an hour to beat, if that, unless you're an achievement hunter, which case I could see it taking a few days. But all in all well worth the price tag if you're looking for something fun and light hearted to play."

Have you ever wished Mega Man was still alive?This game basically fulfills both of those fantasies. I was actually pretty awestruck at how well this game is designed considering its simplicity. Or maybe that's part of the reason why it works so well. Nothing complex here, just jump'n n shoot'n. It's always a good thing when a platformer explains a gimmick or mechanic without actually having to explain it to you, and boy oh boy there are a lot of those moments in this game.It has a health system, though I've only played it on Hard because I'm the most harcorest gamer in this plane of existence, that seems to really be more of a heart counter. On hard you get two hits, and being hit once always drops your power up. I assume this changes for the easier difficulties. You get infinite lives, but there's a couple of achievements that encourage you not to die forever. The powerups themselves are different gun types, such as homing shots, spread/tri-shots, rockets, etc, and a traditional western healing item: cake.  Some are found in the level just waiting for you to pick them up, and others seem to be random but frequent-enough enemy drops.The enemies are typical bad guys in westerners like the guy who likes to shoot at you from windows, the guy who hides behind crates and shoots at you, a DUCK, and mysterious floating sawblades. You know.. Typical westerner villains. OH and there's this train level and the boss is.. well, unexpected considering the enemy types introduced up to that point, but AMAZING NONETHELESS.The music is nice and varied, but honestly it doesn't sound very spaghetti to me. That being said, it does not detract from the experience at all and I DO like it. It just wasn't as Morricone as I was expecting to be.Also you're a cowboy/gunslinging damsel/duck. This game is the closest you'll ever get to a realistic John Wayne Simulator. I rate it *****/*****.~ Niddo ""Stump Grinder"" Johnson"

I've always been a fan of the Western theme. The music is very good, and I like the unique visual style.  The gameplay is easy to pick up, and new elements are introduced a little at a time. My only complaint so far is that there are no sound effects for footsteps and some other things. There's the music and the sound of your gun firing. It's minimalistic in a way, and you'll get used to it without much trouble, but I guess that was just unexpected. Chalk it up to a creative design choice.  Definitely worth the $2 I paid for it."

The story is essentially your girl is taken and you need to go save her by running to the right through 20 stages. It's got a good style, and has decent music. The problem with the game is that it really is a bare bones side scroller. There is no story, no real characters, there are a few really frustrating levels and the game can be completed within an hour. After you complete it you can play through the game again as a passive duck (I am not kidding haha) but other than achievements there is really no reason to replay this.HOWEVER all that being said, the developer's are obviously smart enough to know that their game is tiny and lacking on content. Since they have priced the game accordingly.The game only costs $2 ... a toonie as we say where I am from. So I can't really knock the game due to that. If it was $5 or more I would be tearing this game apart here, but it's not. It's a little cute game that has a little price tag. For what it is, I do recommend it."
