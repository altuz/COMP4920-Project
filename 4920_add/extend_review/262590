76561197993891197,Recommended,262590,9918736,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,CtrlAltDestroy,"I had previously downvoted this game, citing many bugs and frustrations with the control scheme and the GUI. But after an incredible show of dedication from the developers in addressing and fixing (nearly) every one of my complaints in the ""massive invisible"" patch, I'm finally giving the game a thumbs-up. Very impressive, guys! Previously, I felt that this game might have perhaps gotten more attention and understanding as an ""early access"" title, but now it has earned its status as a finished product, one which can be built upon. I'm confident that the small number of remaining issues left will be addressed, and even if not, they do not detract too much from the game's quality.The puzzle design of Chuck's Challenge can only be described as some of the best you will see in any puzzle game, and that's no surprise because the game and most of its levels come from the brilliant mind of Chuck Sommerville, the man behind Chip's Challenge. While the puzzles are quite a bit smaller in comparison to Chip's Challenge, they are so deceptively simple that sometimes they blow the mind. You could spend a half-hour tinkering with a stage that's so small and simple and has such few moving parts, and in the end you can only blame yourself for not seeing that one obvious answer that was hanging in front of your nose the whole time. And that's one of the highest levels of praise I can offer to any puzzle game.The game has some great anti-frustration features, namely the ability to undo any move at any time, and even to replay previous solutions (a brand new feature from the old versions)!! The undo functionality was previously horribly broken and allowed for bad solutions, but the ""massive invisible"" update has rewritten it from scratch seems to have made it quite bulletproof. Just be warned, if you're aiming for speed medals and records, the rewind feature won't help you much because it adds +5 seconds to your time whenever it is used, but it's great if you're trying to solve a puzzle for the first time and accidentally push a block into a corner or something.The GUI has been criticized for being designed with touchscreens primarily in mind, but enough improvements and concessions have been made for mouse-and-keyboard users that it's not so much of a problem anymore.Oh, and let's not forget to mention the level editor. Though the interface is slightly quirky, it's a cinch to hop into the editor and prototype a level idea, tinker with it, then upload it for the world to see into an ever-expanding database of user-designed levels, complete with individual leaderboards. The game has even implemented a new feature letting you click on a specially-formatted URL which will launch Chuck's Challenge and load a custom level automatically. Though it could stand to have a few more features (functionality for level packs, or some way of knowing which custom levels you've beaten), an eternal supply of user-generated content is the heart and soul of a game like this, and it doesn't disappoint.Some small quirks and bugs still exist, but they are absolutely benign compared to what they were before, and no longer detract from the core of the experience: the bliss of solving awesome puzzles. Overall, recommended for all fans of Chip's Challenge, as well as any newcomer or veteran to the block-pushing puzzle genre.Here's my upvote, developers. You've earned it."

It's not a Chip's Challenge redux, but it definitely has the same spirit - bringing in  50% entertainment and 50% frustration (after all, I never even played through Chip's Challenge since it got too... brainy ... for me >_>). A bit too cutesy at times and some of the sound effects can get quite bothersome after trying to beat a level after multiple attempts. Great music, though! Highly recommended!"

While it's not quite as good as the original, Chuck's Challenge 3D is definitely a lot of fun, and I'd say that it's definitely worth the $9.99 that I paid for it. It includes a level editor and custom puzzles can be shared with friends. There is also a weekly featured puzzle that is created by the community.The interface feels a little clunky, clearly designed for mobile first, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad PC port. The puzzles are fun, the game performs well, and I have fun with it.It doesn't appear to support Steam Cloud, meaning that levels that I complete on my laptop won't be synced to my desktop and other computers.

If you enjoy solving puzzles, then try this out. The levels included I would call \""easy\"" to \""moderate\"" in difficulty, whereas \""hard\"" would be more like DROD or Snakebird.CC really brings the joy. There\'s a huge number of game elements here, and a fun thing is seeing how they interact together. For example, a level can be constructed to be like a factory with monsters pushing buttons in an automated way to open and close doors.The game includes a nice level editor that is easy to use, and the player community has already contributed many good levels. It\'s easy to imagine spending hundreds of hours on it, once you get into the habit of playing the new levels that get released on a regular basis."

These levels are probably the hardest (some of them I have no clue how it could be possible to solve them)- Ones which require your timing : it is all about going at the right pace, at the right moment (they can be tricky but not actually hard)- Ones which requires your fingers and nerves : just run from the beginning to the end, without stopping will often work. Trouble is that you can't afford the slightest mistake in the whole level as it is instant death (or forever trapped).Of course, whatever the kind of level you play, the ultimate goal is to get a good rank among all the players who have succeded before you (and there are good people out there, so it's not easy to get high in the ranks).What's more ? There is a weekly challenge (ranked as well, of course), and you can create and share your home-made levels (there's an even achievement for that)Well, to be honest, I have to mention the controls : when trying to play for the ranking, you need as few moves as possible, so you'd like to move in a predetermined path you've selected to be the fastest (or sometimes, the only one). That is pretty hard to do : most of the time, Woop will make one more step before turning, and this step will lead you into ... water ! (or magma, or a monster, plenty of ways to die, yay !).Well, that's it ! Pack your brains, hone your skills and challenge the ranking !"

I found myself in a situation where I was still amused by these kinds of puzzles. The developer sure succeeded in making the new set of mechanics work and making the whole thing look beautiful.While the game does a poor job of explaining what it is you're picking up through the ( slightly redundant, yet quite funny ) story sequences, I don't think anyone will have a hard time figuring it out on the go.I'd also like to mention that there's absolutely no lack of content here. There are numerous standard levels to play through and there's Steam Workshop levels if you want to keep going after that.Overall, this is a fun little game that I can use to fill up my spare time and sniff up some nostalgia with."
,Recommended,262590,14270547,"Posted: 31 January, 2015",all,chairbender,"A hidden gem of a puzzle game! I wish I would've known about this sooner. It took me about 10.5 hours to beat every stage (everything up to and including flummery), but there's much more fun to be had going for more medals, weekly challenges, and using the level creator.If you like puzzle games, you'll almost certainly enjoy this game. It's very well paced and doesn't feel repetitive - each level feels like it has a unique ""trick"" to it and they add new items and enemies at a good rate. I found the difficulty curve to be great as well - I never really got frustrated on a stage and never felt like a stage was too long.The levels are always just the right size - unlike chip's challenge where you would not be able to see everything you need to see sometimes (due to levels being really large), this game makes it very clear and precise while maintaining a charming visual aesthetic.One of the things that makes this game really fun is infinite undo and rapid restarting. You don't EVER have to go through a section you've already solved if you make a mistake because you can just hit backspace. If you're trying to beat a level without undoing (like making an attempt to get a high score), you can just hit R and instantly restart if you make a mistake. And as a nice touch, the timer doesn't start counting until you make your first move.The level design is really what makes this game stand out for me. It's brimming with creativity, polish and game design expertise, no doubt building on Chuck's experience with Chip's challenge. Levels aren't simply about pushing blocks into specific positions - they might be about dodging enemies, using switches, building bridges, etc...it does an excellent job of making every level have a unique concept/central idea/key trick, leading to a plethora of satisfying ""eureka"" moments as you discover them while playing around with the level.It doesn't just stop at being a great solitary experience - you can compete for time on every stage using the online leaderboards. At this level of play, the game does become a bit more about execution and less about puzzle solving, but still maintains an aspect of puzzling as you try to figure out the most effecient path to the goal. So, regardless of whether the execution or puzzle solving appeals to you, you'll get something out of the leaderboards. With the stages that ship with the game, you can also just replay them to try to get the silver and gold medals. There's also community-created maps and a weekly puzzle (selected from the best of the community maps each week) - so each week presents a new opportunity to test your skills against other players.On a completely different track, you can design levels and share them with the community. There's a rudimentary voting system so you can see how people like your creations. This game gives you such a variety of tools and such a solid mechanical foundation to work with that it's an excellent platform to express your game design creativity and feel good about making something fun for other people to enjoy.Definitely give this a go if you like puzzle games. I've played a lot of puzzle games and this game ranks up there with my top 5, maybe even top 3."

But it still can be a bit boring or tiring sometimes, and the correlation between the character and the pets/animals/monsters is weird and unpredictable.My recommendation is: If you like puzzle games go ahead and buy it, its cheap and worth the money, and when playing go for 2 to 3 hour rounds and exit to get the most out of it without getting tired or bored.Look, its not a perfect game, but I'm glad I bought it, and I hope my review can be of use for you to decide wether you want to buy it or not, have fun!"

Very rarely have I come across a hint that actually does its job without fail.Now this doesn't necessarily affect the gameplay in any aspects, but I do imagine this bugged hint system is going to cause some trouble later on when I find myself stuck and am in dire need of a hint to get me in the right direction. Other than that though the gameplay is really tight, I love the art direction of the characters, and the puzzles themselves are very creative and offer a lot when it comes to making you're own custom puzzles even."

I was just getting to video games at the time, but the PC started my adventure into the gaming culture.  We have two games for it at the start that got my absolute attention: Sonic CD and Chip's Challenge.Chip's Challenge was a puzzle game that got my attention for days on end, and I felt accomplished when I was able to beat a level and shout in victory. Even when it was ten years later, I would boot up that computer just to play chip's challenge, and it still gives a bit of a challenge now.This game serves as a spirtual and literal sequel to the game of old.  It has some of the charm and mechanics of the old game in it.  It has a simple plot that surrounds it.  The game even has a level editor and online support, so I await to see what special maps come out of it.For any fans of the old Chip's Challenge, this game is definitely worth a buy."

The most glaring issue is that often, completing a level will not mark it as complete, forcing you to do it all again. Aside from that, occasionally graphics will disappear or controls will stop responding entirely, requiring you to restart. But not recording progress is unforgivable for a level-based puzzler.Overall, while visually appealing, this game is ruined by its bugs. I recommend to play Chip's Challenge instead."

This game forces you to sit through dialogue, but the dialogue is mostly pointless. The game doesn't give you any reason to care at the beginning about either the story or the gameplay. The environment lacks theming and the pacing and puzzles are uninteresting. I just don't see what could draw people in. This game also  needs some serious proofreading. If there's one thing I hate in games, it's unprofessional presentation; and the presentation in this game has poor literacy and is generally very mobile-game-like."

Let me start by saying that I loved Chip's Challenge, have finished it many times and have owned it on about half a dozen different plaforms, and I bought this game solely because of who was behind it.On the upside, it's very colourful and friendly, the plot is non-existent (seriously, what kind of storyline would make sense with this one?) and the community maps integration means you'll never be short of new levels.BUT I find the controls very lethargic (apparently that's been worked on), the difficulty curve absolutely insane (about on a par with ""Oh No More Lemmings""), where you have several incredibly easy levels followed by one that'll leave you stumped for days, and the control system was blatantly designed for a touchscreen and has been badly ported to the desktop systems. It's just my opinion but I think compared to Chip there are simply too many different types of keys, doors and monsters and it becomes quite messy and overcomplicated at times. I also dislike the forced integration with the online system which does things like tell you that 634 people completed that level quicker than you. Really? I don't care.Gah. I normally enjoy writing negative reviews as it's quite cathartic to lay into something which has been annoying you for hours on end, but I don't feel any of that here. I really, really wanted to like Chuck's Challenge 3D.I really wish I could recommend this game as a worthy successor to Chip's Challenge but unfortunately I can't, due to what I've written above. Hopefully at some point Chuck will get the licensing sorted out and we can have a proper Chip's Challenge 2. This isn't it, sadly. If you want more Chip, go and get a copy of the GPL game Tile World, and one of the community map packs like CCLP2 (if you see a copy of Windows Entertainment Pack 4 or Best of Windows Entertainment Pack, it'll work with the data files from the original game too, and Chuck will hopefully get some royalties). You'll have more fun.Sorry, Chuck"

The first maps might be easy but after that you dont get things served to you. Every single level is beatable and can be solved with what you can see, but there is no guarantee that you will be able to. All the objects and monsters are easy to figure out how they work (since they operate on a few simple rules), but that does not mean that things wont get complicated. The way I see it complaining about not being able to beat few maps is completely missing the point. You are supposed to be challenged by the maps and try several diffrent ways of solving them, sometimes coming back to them few days after and trying again. The usual in games today is people getting it extremely easy even on hard settings when it comes to puzzles and this is not what this game is about.The bad parts about the game is the blur that comes when you zoom out, some of the design choices are questionable, the controls sometimes are a bit laggy (rarely a problem for me though, specially since so many maps are puzzles where you think not act quickly), the ui is sometimes a bid bad and perhaps worst of all the fact that the progress is saved online after each map (by the time they show you medal). Still the game is very playable and these problems does not take away the fun of solving the puzzles.TL;DR: If you dont like being challenged by puzzles and sometimes not being able to solve them then this game is not for you. I however love the fact that the puzzles are on the level that you can beat them but its sometimes pretty damn hard and takes time. The cons are annoying, but doesnt take away the fun of the game."

Compared to Chips Challenge, it's got a much-needed undo feature, better graphics, and a proper level editor. But the singleplayer levels really aren't as good as in the original game. They're just not as creative or inspired."

It's a bit rough around the edges, but those two things are essentially what Chip's Challenge needed."
,Recommended,262590,15421128,"Posted: 17 April, 2015",all,TheInternetFTW,"Great fun.  But let me be frank up-front: the story sequences are painful.  If you ever read what little story Chip's Challenge has, you'd quickly see that Chuck really should just let his puzzles do the talking.  Especially with this new game, where he inserts himself as a character and makes multiple jokes about being a ""Monkey Boy.""The art and puzzles are fantastic, however, so just start skipping dialog/cutscenes if they bother you.In fact, if in the settings menu there were a ""skip-all-cutscenes' toggle and a 'remove-tutorial-blocks' toggle (which together would remove all dialog), and the ""tilt-shift"" effect was off by default (though pretty, it's far too distracting), this would be a perfect game."

However, be aware of a few things:1) You have to be online and connected to a server to track progress - this means waiting after every level for your score to be recorded, otherwise the game won't register that you've completed a level.2) The level design is a lot easier and a lot less varied than it was in the Chip's Challenge games - however, this could be because there is a ""rewind"" feature to take you back steps, at the cost of a time penalty, so if you don't mind being marked down the levels become a lot easier.3) Some levels are lifted almost whole from Chip's Challenge games, others are just Sokoban (way too many Sokoban levels) and a couple seem to be from The Impossible Game? Only a few levels really strike a true ""Chip's Challenge"" chord.So all in all, this is a decent game if picked up cheaply, and the level creation/player levels adds a lot of lifespan. It has its fair share of faults, which is surprising for a game so simplistic."

,Recommended,262590,18722720,"Posted: 27 October, 2015",all,strangemodule,"Disclaimer: I completed two out of 5 worlds at the time of this review. Although I have not completed the game, I feel I had ""seen enough"" to get the general gist of it.Chuck's Challenge plays just like it looks: like an indie puzzle game. You move a cute alien around and guide him to the exit of each level. The game features hazards that impede your path or kill you, items that let you mitigate some of said hazards, enemies with varying behaviors, and occasionally mandatory collectables needed to open certain locked doors. The game's puzzles start off easy enough, but gradually scale higher and higher in difficulty.Generally, puzzles come in two flavors: the ""obstacle course"" puzzles and the ""non-threating moving blocks"" puzzles. The ""obstacle course"" puzzles tend to be straightforward (although naturally get more bendy in their solutions in later levels) where you have to dodge enemies and navigate through hazards to reach the end. The ""moving blocks"" puzzles consist of small levels where nothing threatens your life but must instead move a limited amount of boxes around a tightly-packed space onto pressure switches to open the way to the exit. The game does sometimes blur the two together, but those make up the main ""types"" of puzzles you'll experience.Chuck's Challenge screams ""mobile game"", but it's the good kind of mobile port. You'll see all the mobile staples; from the Angry-Birds style menus, the overtly colorful and cutesey (but low-budget) graphics, the 3-star time-based rating system, and how each world (basically a level pack of a set difficulty with a unique theme) unlocks only after beating a certain amount of levels before it. However, you'll find the game runs smoothly and the basic WASD movement to be acceptable. My only complaints port-wise involve how the graphics settings only allow you to switch between the Unity-engine presets (""Fastest"" to ""Beautiful""), and that non-movement buttons (such as manually undoing a move) require going into the game's manual to find the button for.My primary complaints for the game involve one subjective feeling about the game's difficulty, and the poor audio balance:+Regarding the difficulty, I found the ""moving box"" puzzles to require much more thinking time and figuring out than any other puzzle in the same world. I have to hand it to Chuck, those puzzles make for great brain teasers, but also could use a much gentler difficulty curve. The non-moving box puzzles before and after them required ludicrously less amount of time to solve than those of the same world, and I can only imagine them getting much worse. To add even more frustration, the game claims to offer a ""Replay system"" which will show a clue how to solve the puzzle. However, I found that only one level I tried it on (the last moving-box level of World 2 I believe) actually had a Replay, and the rest did not. I find this feature to be rather useless as a result.+For some reason, the sound balance of the game is extremely off, even painful for headphone users. Enemy noises (those that play when the main character is near an enemy), as well as wearing the ice roller (item that lets you freely move on ice) play an extremely loud sound effect. Comparatively, the sound effects for collecting items, and even the main character's death noise, are very quiet. I'm not sure what happened, but the sound balance needs some work.Overall, if you're looking for a quick and dirty puzzle game that boasts some legitimate challenge, Chuck's Challenge will fill that niche. It's cheap and regularly on sale as well."

Back before you kids had calls of duty and battlefields, we had Chip's Challenge. We walked around, collecting keys to open doors, avoiding enemies and all sorts of death traps, while wearing certain power ups or suits or whatever to pass certain obstacles. And we liked it.Fast foward a few decades, and we get Chuck's Challenge 3D, a sort of tribute to the classics. It plays like Chip's Challenge, as well as looking and sounding nice. There's also a level creator (so you can post your stuff to the steam workshop for others to enjoy).Overall, a great experience if you enjoyed Chip's Challenge, you'll enjoy this game.Even though you can outright buy Chip's Challenge 1 and 2 here on steam now. .-.Now all we need is a remastering of 3D Space Pinball..."

Graphically the game seems aimed at younger kids, but unless your kid is gifted they won't make it past the first 'chapter'. Being able to make custom content means the game is much more usable and feasable as entertainment for kids. (On the premise of finding or making the levels)Cons:- Uninterruptable fluff. In particular the 'help' texts that result from stepping on a 'shirt'. Sometimes you might accidently step on a shirt and have to click through a bunch of fluff again before being able to play the level.- Interface is a bit slow and can be a little awkward.Other:- Has some story/fluff content. It's ok, but sometimes tends to feel more like an annoyance or interruption than actually helping me immerse in the game or the like.- The game seems to be a port or made by someone used to programming for a different platform atleast."

I am glad to see Chip's Challenge is back albeit Chip has ended up as some purple alien being given challenges by a level designer in a Hawaiian shirt (which is actually a well drawn up animation of Chuck Sommerville the developer of both Chip's and Chuck's challenge) The puzzles are just as well thought up as the were back in the 90s. There are weekly puzzles to be solved and even a level designer so you can make your own challenges to the Steam community via the Steam workshop. The art style is cute and gives a new yet nostaligic feeling to the whole package and scales up to large screen HDTVs very nicely; with controller and keyboard well implented it is a joy to play on the sofa or at the computer desk.
