,Recommended,262650,10977353,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,Patrick Griffiths | Indieworx,"First off I would like to say that I have used a selection of 3d software before, I use them for my work and as a hobby...This is a very nice application, I truly believe that it has some great potential to become even better, its not the 'best' I don't believe in best, but this is a very nice and reasonable price and it's not just another 3d modelling application, the developer(s) have gone ahead and designed a really nice set of new features using inovative technology which is specific to this software. If you'd like to learn more look up the Text-To-3D mentioned a lot on the main website and page here.Aside from that set of Text-To-3D it has a nice selection of simple tools that will allow you to make some really nice models, whether you want to just get into making models as a hobby or if you're looking to mod a game,  add items to steam workshops or use it with Unity, you can do all of that, and more...I think that I like how simple this application is to use, its straighforward, has everything there for you in clear sight. If you're worried about paying for this when you see people saying ""just use Blender, its free"" give it a shot and if you're having troubel you won't regret snagging this application, its a lot easier to use, it's not the same in many ways and has unique features and Bledner does a couple of things that this doesn't however... You're capable of doing anything that you would need in regards to modelling for any game you would like to create and or any mod content you desire to make and upload to the workshops here on steam. I mention Blender as I know it will come up if you're looking into a 3d software, they both have their pros and cons but if you're looking for something simple, straight forward and easy to learn, this will be the one to pick, blender is nice, but had a steaper learning curve for sure!Read over the features, check the site out and if you're interested, feel free to add me and ask any questions. I am a fan of this software and I will be using it to teach a couple of my close friends how to make 3d models with it because they were unable to learn Blender and the way that it worked. I personally take a lot longer to do things in Blender than in this too, and Iuse Maya professionally for work. I would happily and may very well incorporate RaySupreme 3D into my workflow for low to medium poly game assets. I very much look forward to seeing where this software goes, I would definitely say that this software is worth a serious look for any amateur or newcomer to the 3d world and even people a little more versed with 3d, it's fund to use.I apologise to the devs for mentioning Blender in this review...Kind Regards,Patrick Griffiths.::Edit::.I am currently recording a set of video tutorials on using this software for making game assets and will work on making a bonus video on importing them to certain games workshops here on steam.Playlist Link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMOfDUrmtBQsH4JgIpN38KaXj1-W_qK_i"

This was a huge waste of money even though I got it on sale. The fact that it keeps crashing means that none of their supposedly cool features matter. Just get Blender; it's free, does a lot more, and isn't hard to use. Blender also supports CUDA-based GPU rendering."

,Not Recommended,262650,11571447,"Posted: 6 August, 2014",all,DarkWolfModding,Wasted $40. This may look like its a good program but its not. I cant even use it for 10 minutes then it crashes. It crashes using some tools too. Your better off downloading Blender 7.1 at least with blender it only crashes a couple times a week or so (Maybe 1 to 3) thats using it for hours on end every day. I havent experienced any crashes recently with blender. Blender is much more stable than this program and the best part is Blender is free.I am not using Ray supreme until they update and fix all the glitches and bugs.DO NOT BUY THIS BUGGY PROGRAM! GET BLENDER.Im not one to really bash a program but this one is another story. Litteraly no joke It crashes almost every 5-10 min.If you want to have a good program for 3D download Blender in cunjunction with 3D Coat you will have plenty of tools with those two programs together for any modeling needs. (You have to buy 3D Coat by the way)
,Not Recommended,262650,12606250,"Posted: 23 October, 2014",all,Reizla,"Though I'm starting with 3D modelling, it's said that RaySupreme is far easier than Blender - this is not true!Explorting to .OBJ is supported BUT you do have to make the object editable. While exporting, ANY material added to the mesh IS NOT saved to the OBJ.Exporting to FBX kinda fives the same problem as described above aside from only a color being saved and not the material. With that, importing the FBX into Blender it's enlarged by a factor 25. Importing the FBX into Unity3D is totally not showing a single thing.An other extremely annoying thing is the constant crashing when editing/deleting stuff withing the program. Means that you either have o save much & save often OR loose all work in progress.IMO save your money and grab Blender. That's a 100% discount compared to RaySupreme and at least everything is working as it should."

I downloaded it just now, so that's a good thing.  It's a fair modeler when these additions download.  There might be quirks, like having to highlight the help pages to read them, but other than some quirks and limited animation options... it's good.Original Review:Pros and Cons+ Array modelingisRaySupreme's strong point as long as a minimum of 4 instances occur.  The array tool in RaySupreme is better than many other low cost and free options.+ UV options are more extensive than I expected+ The nodal options and text options can increase speed if utilized+ The included downloadable materials are appreciated and helpful+ a variety of stone materials are available after download+ path animation is present for objects- Modeling a single object is not RaySupreme's strong point as doing so is slower than other options available- many metals like bronze and silver are not present- path animation does not work for cameras(At least I haven't figured out how yet.)- no updates to the program itself, as it is being rewritten as an html 5 app- camera options are severely limited... I can't find a way to create a 2nd or 3rd camera... it has free and fixed.. but rendering these frames through this camera, and these frames through another camera... not going to happen unless an update changes thingsStill to test~ Material grouping for Substance Designer... if RaySupreme can do this, then I could go directly from RaySupreme to Substance Designer as I can with Wings3D"

We attempted to use it, we thoroughly regretted it and shelled out the money for lightwave.Pro:It makes models.It got patched to give us primitives to work with.It has a GUI.Con:It's buggy.I can't import any OBJ it exports into blender to continue the work someone else did.It's boolean functions decide it's a great idea to just flip faces around willy nilly.It fills the model with worthless vertices.It's exported obj is just chalk full of errors.The customer support is horrendus. I asked a question, I still havn't gotten an answer in a *month*.0/10. Will not ever recommend to anyone."

,Recommended,262650,13382435,"Posted: 15 December, 2014",all,mrmangosir,"So, previous version was a little rocky in terms of stability on Linux. It's been ok, but has crashed and  not quite worked for me and maybe others?So 1.6 came along and you can tell the developers have been working hard. They've clearly listened to users, even us Linux users. The UI looks much better and the application feels more stable.So for a reasonable priced 3D application, it's good. There are some improvements to be added, but they are catching up on decades of mature 3D applications.If you are a 3D expert, not sure what this will give you over what you have already. Maybe download a demo and find out, it could surpise you. If you want to get into 3D, this isn't a bad choice and you don't have the steep learning curve of say Blender."

But trying to download EVERYTHING for this program has 1 taken longer a hour for 1 file to be downloaded plus freezes the program causing it to crash. From my experience with this program. This is not worth $40 AT ALL. I give this program a 0/10 because no shapes, materials, any of the sort is given when you first install the program.

If you want 3D modeling software, search for which has a large ans serious development team, that have solid bases, and not those that are developed just for fun as RaySupreme.Don't be fooled by him the way that I was deceived by this app, the RaySupreme is not a serious project.
