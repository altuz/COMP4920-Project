76561197992764616,Not Recommended,262690,9438308,"Posted: 12 March, 2014",all,cataclysm49,"If you like Isometric Racing games (a very sparce genre), then you might enjoy this. Otherwise, this game is very unlikely to make you a convert. The game is riddled with poor design decisions that include some excessive grinding.Additionally, visual feedback leaves much to be desired. You'll occasionally go off a jump that was nearly indistinguishable from regular road and be unable to turn while you're flying through the air. Add to this the fact that going anywhere near the walls of the track will lead to certain doom. Clip a cross street corner (even ones that appear to be blocked off by light walls) and you'll lose all speed and get passed by every single AI opponent. Be prepared for them to occasionally ram you in them as well.Worst of all is the fact that all on track feedback is the same color. Arrows point the way and are centered in the track in light neon blue. Also in neon blue are walls blocking off all other paths. When you're flying along (especially with the higher level cars) there is little time to react, this is where most racing games rely on level design to instinctively lead the player down the right path. The use of the same color for where you can and cannot go has caused more than a few frustrating crashes.Finally the fact that you are driving through the city means that view of the track and your car is occasionally obscured by buildings (usually several times per race). Had they had the buildings partially transparent when the camera view approaches, it would have been fine, but trying to turn corners or avoid cars blind is unbareable.Despite all this, the game is somewhat addicting, and it's obvious that the game had a lot of potential. It is disappointing that they squandered so much of it. I can't really recommend it, but it might be worth a try if you can get it at a discout."

Yes, it is. Here you can find pretty fun races, with cool cars (they aren't licensed, but you'll recognize them) and reasonable graphics. The achievements are challenging and it'll make you play it for hours and hours.""But, I'm Windows/Mac user, should I buy it?"" Well, you'll have more racing options in these platform, but maybe you enjoy LRS anyway, I just don't know if for LRS' price you can't find a better game. But maybe you should buy LRS in a promotion."
,Recommended,262690,9131440,"Posted: 15 February, 2014",all,Aussiedroid,"Top-down racing games in more recent years have been very hit and miss affair more often than not missing the 'fun factor' that makes this sort of game appealing. Little Racers STREET is an exception, although basic in respects to lacking the powerups & weapons often seen in the genre, the straight racing aspect is very enjoyable. You have good control over your car through the hundreds of combinations of tracks created through two larger city block maps. Having just the two main locations though, does result in some lack of variety on the scenery & terrain front.The selection of camera views, from more traditional top-down to the more modern chase views let you play how you want - you could even play this more like a third person racer if you wanted!The career mode is extensive, with lots of challenges to complete & cars to unlock as you work your way up the classes from E to A. Racing really starts to become fun from Class C onwards as this is when you need to start using brake/handbrake and drift around more. Cars can also be upgraded and you can modify the paint & pattern. There is no story or anything exciting to mention in career mode, rather more of a 'grindy' career covering things like .. win xx races, win xx races with xx car - same goes for most of the achievements. You can progress the career mode online which makes it more challenging and also more fun than racing the AI.Races are quick, generally lasting just a few minutes but this suits the gamestyle - this can be increased in multiplayer mode only if you host. Playing against your friends is where this becomes the best fun but online against others is still a fun challenge. Thankfully the multiplayer doesn't suffer from an nasty bounce corner moves or other dirty play but do expect some fast drivers! Since the LRS has only just been released at time of writing this, it is not too hard to find an online game currently (will have to wait and see if the community hangs around). There is no way to select your track or setup a tournament through multiplayer which is a bit of a let down.It's an XBox Live port but has been programmed well for a change for the PC with detailed graphics & smooth camera work. It's not perfect but it is pretty good.There were some things that I didn't like so much, such as the sound effects and music were bland; nothing great. Music selection is limited/repetitive and car sounds and impacts are pretty basic to my ears. Also, all the AI racers feel the same, follow same paths and make the same mistakes - there are a few tracks you will easily win due to AI crashing out on a corner every time getting stuck. Harder AI simply seemed to mean they have faster cars putting you at a clear disadvantage - no better drivers as such which makes the harder difficulty not more challenging just more frustrating!Some more variety in game modes would have been good too. Given the cityscapes a timed live-route mode (ala Grid 2) would have been great along with other skill challenges such as how fast you could go without hitting anything. More jumps (bigger jumps!), more elevation, more race shortcuts, more drifting & various hazards all would add so much to the experience.It has the basics in gameplay well refined which is thoroughly enjoyable, but falls short of being a classic due to the limitations I mention above. Still worth checking out if you like these sorts of games, good value and is one of the better ones on Steam!!If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"
,Recommended,262690,14877851,"Posted: 14 March, 2015",all,RockstarCRO,"At first when I saw this game I was reminded Super Off Road or RC Pro Am (on NES) and was hoping for something similar. I got it, and I got a little more.Definitely what is shown on the trailer is the basis of what this game is. It's a top down sort of racer with dynamic camera angles that definitely make up the game. The first camera angle reminds me somewhat of Super Off Road,RC Pro Am, or Sim City 3 when you take control of vehicles. Not a bad angle, and a good one for nostalgic feel. However, some problems persist with views as you'll see buildings get in your way. None the less an outline of your car is shown but sometimes it is difficult to see. Which brings me to the next camera angle which is dynamic and shows you more of the track ahead of you. The variety of camera angles adds depth to the game.One would think of course seeing your player would be of utmost importance. It is but it adds to the game play. The driving itself is relatively simple and reminds me of literally having a toy car between my fingers (which is not a bad thing). For a grown man I like the game for the grown-up feel it gives but I like it at the same time sort of bringing me back in time when games were simpler (such as Pro Am or Off Road). The driving handles great and the ability to see if you beat your best track time is made even easier. Nitro is also a big factor within the game and when to use it. I find even playing at medium difficulty you may come in first a lot, but there will be some races where it will feel sort of inconsistent and you'll find yourself having a hard time catching up to first. Damage is sort of negligible but I'm only on class D and as the cars get faster more damage may occur. Damage of course has to be paid after each race. After completing races there are achievements such as completing every course on a certain racing level. There are credits rewarded in career mode after racing which enables cars to be upgraded or new ones to be bought. There is even a free roam mode to choose from! That's pretty sweet!Thevisualsare suitable to this game, and maybe in a few places could have been better. I like the fact that toy cars were used. Cars have a custom paint option. It's almost like having my micro machine toy car the color I've always wanted it. It's not need for speed detail but it's enough detail to keep the game cool. Thesoundsare decent, nothing too amazing but nothing short of good. When the guy says final lap or new best time it sort of sounds off. Either than that no complaints.I like this game and would like to see a DLC or something added. Maybe add weapons in the game and make it like mario kart? Why not a demolition mode? I'd suggest more things but I'm not getting paid here for them. (Cop chases anyone)?This is a good game... I like this game so obviously it will get a good rating. I bought it on sale and if it suits you I'd recommend buying it. Sucks that it isn't local co-op but I can see why (would be hard seeing each car). Food for thought though! There is a bit of a grind with career mode when it comes to getting new cars but the races are short and enjoyable enough that you won't notice, until you start getting to later classes where prices are high. The bonus of it is that some races have a pretty big pay-out. If you don't care for some achievement or potential card opportunity then just keep on going to the horse races. Could have been easily an 8 if more game modes were added.RATING : 7.1/10.GameplayB+Story / CampaignC+Visuals / User InterfaceB-Sounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityC+OverallB-Also the multiplayer seems to be somewhat alive at certain times. Either than that it can be pretty quiet. Buy a four pack?"
76561198022266051,Recommended,262690,20879969,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,OakenPants,"A very good racing game where the more you play it the worse it gets...The game starts off really, really fun -- you're entry level Class E racing car.  Paint it your desired two-tone pattern in whatever colors and pattern you like, and upgrade it if you wish as you earn money.  The races are also very well done -- a variety of weather to include rain and snow and many, many variety of maps.  Then after each race which is anywhere from 3 to 12 laps or so depending on the length of each lap, you can see how you ranked against the world, which I think is great -- I love leaderboards, as they push you on and add some replay value.The downside for me, though, started with Class C.  Class E is a lot of fun and Class D was more of a balanced challenge and still a lot of fun.  Class C, though, good grief.... Cars are going through subdivisions at 160+ mph making hair pin turns and over 250 mph on the straightaways.  It suddenly become a lot LESS fun when the physics is so ridiculous and it's now become a ""twitch racer"".  On Class C's, B's, and the few Class A tracks I raced you have to start turning before the turn is even visible on the screen.  Class C is ""playable"" for those determined, but just.On the good side:+ Good AI opponents, from 3 to 11 computer cars running around the track with you.+ Excellent variety of tracks.  Class E alone has over 50 tracks, and some of the Classes had over 70 tracks.+ Nice variety of environments / maps.  The tracks are spread across several different cities, and each track is certain selection of roads on that city map.  Excellent.+ Class E and D are simply a lot of fun+ Skid marks remain on trackOn the OK side:~ Sounds could have been better.  Such as the sound of the dam on certain maps / tracks uses the sound effect for a running stream -- doesn't match.~ There are a few hills, but it's too hard to tell if it IS a hill or a slight turn in the road.  Misjudged many times until I just learned to recognize that part of the map.~ Both odd and unclear when selecting a track.  When starting out a race, you are presented with 5 tracks to pick titled E1-E5.  The next race you are again presented with E1-E5, but they're different tracks.  There's no explanation of what it's doing or why.  It's just confusing.  I just pick the first one I haven't raced before (as it lists that number in the race track details) and go.~ Weather mostly only affects traction.  A ""slight"" graphic tweak but other than that you hardly notice any difference -- you still race at basically the same speeds and no real change to racing style.~ In Classes D and E, the more damage your race car has, the slower your race car now goes.  It is manageable though as you crash less often due to traveling slower and more time to react.  And when you do crash less speed = less damage to car, thus not as big of an impact (so to speak) on your car's top speed or acceleration.On the bad side:- Everything becomes way WAY too fast to be enjoyable any more, which causes a wide variety of problems / issues I have with the game- Game turns into a ""Twitch racer"".  If you see something enter your screen, you have to immediately react to it or its too late.  In higher classes, it probably IS already too late.- Little forgiveness of player mistakes in later classes.  On the higher classes, play nearly perfect or enjoy loosing.- The physics become just too broken for me to enjoy it.  Cars go from 0 to 150 in like 1.5 secs; cars can make hairpin turns at over 100 mph....  this makes a player mistake in a race basically a podium-ending event, as while the player can accelerate quickly after the crash, all the speed was lost and also your car is briefly thrown into the air for a few more 'punishing' seconds.- In Classes C and up, the more damage your car has the slower it goes.  The problem is, you're now going so much faster with less reaction time, you naturally crash a lot more.  Crash more at these levels and you are now getting LAPPED.  This is the only race car game ever where I got lapped by the computer, and there's not that many laps...Overall, I do recommend the game -- just stay in the Class E and D classes and have fun.By Class C the game is no longer any fun at all for me and become ""work"".  If speed / physics was reduced to more realistic levels, the game could easily be a 80%+ game score...  as it is, I'd give it a 60% which is a little generous considering how miserable the later classes were for me."
,Recommended,262690,15305978,"Posted: 11 April, 2015",all,markreed757,I play this game pretty much everyday.  I can not reccomend this game enough if you are a racing fan.  They have time trials for every track.  Which gives you something to shoot for after you have completed all of the regular game play.  I call it regular game play where you have to race each class to earn money to buy new cars and buy upgrades.Then you have a daily challenge where you have up to 24 hours to get your fastest lap in and see how you did against everyone else that played that day.

Quick races, upgrades, and plenty of paint and decal options get you hooked while the simplicity of the game keeps you rather white knuckled.  Pair that with multiplayer and wango bango! You have a winner!  Price is pretty cheap too.  I'd give it a solid A because it is cross platform and uses very little system resources.  I run this on Linux and there are no problems."

It should be a bit more 'big' however like more realistic car names and some new, bit more sunny maps should be included. And the normal camera view should be a default (or at least an easy to find option) since everybody who wants a 'normal' car simulator likely will disregard this game since they will think that the isometric/'bird point of view' view is the only option. But after you set it properly it is a really fun arcade car simultor game."
,Recommended,262690,12863874,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,Attilion,"A good little racing game that could have been great and even become a cult classic asMicro Machinesonce did. If the visual execution and the gameplay feeling of an arcade racer are skillfuly done, there are too many flaws that cannot be simply overlooked. Some are detrimental to the game, some just minor details. From bad to worse:- The algorithm that randomize each race does not seem to adjust the number of racers to the size of the race, transforming some of them into stock car racing where you spend a lot of your time shouting ""Get out of the *@%*$ way"" at your screen, which was not my idea of the game. Unless it was endorsed by NASCAR, which it is not.- The AI racers become more skilled after each lap (so do you, which is a good kind of balancing), but over 10 laps (the random factor allows 15+ laps races), the other racers attain near-perfection driving, forcing your loss in a way. That and some cars seem to be over-powered compared to the category you're in (but maybe that's just me being a bad driver).- The game has a lot of grinding built in, just so you know.- The general visibility is sometimes broken by too much information (a lot of cars, scenery, lighting...) and you'll be confused wondering whose car you're driving (unless you painted it flashy pink with lime green bands just to recognize it). The track readability is not that great either. Plus, parts of the background will be in front of your eyes, blocking the street and the cars from your view. Which is dumb, the background is fine where it is... in the back.- Your car will bounce off random edges. Some you will see (sidewalks), some that are invisible according to the way the track is divided. The fact that any car with a certain velocity will lose its momentum and bounce back is beyond my comprehension though.That's a long list but I still like this game. I'm just disappointed because it could have truly been a magnificient one with a few tweaks. Maybe the next one will be better."

Is say this without a shadow of humour intended since this is not a game with a story line. Some might call it a time waster. I on the other hand like to call it a great new concept in the world of racing since this combines both a 3D and a very familiar top down easy to learn racing approach.The game is simple enough all the way through. Buy a car, upgrade it and get the best car through the process of doing many races around many a map. The races give you money, etc. All very typical stuff. The thing I admire is the total lack of a ""loser"" attitude. That's what makes it fun. If you've ever played Need For Speed then you'll know how frustrating it is to receive the ""you lose"" message after you don't come first in a race. Here on the contrary it doesn't matter at all. You receive a particualr amount of money based on your position in a particular race (and did I mention how you have to pay for the damage done to your car during a race?). This in turn allows you to ""progress"", you could say, to buy new types of faster cars for your garage which you can then race against the same classes of cars.I like this system. In this way races never seem to be unbalanced seeing as how once you've upgraded your car to a new class that car can no longer partake in races for anything but its own class. In fact I see this as a massive boost to online multiplayer as well. From my experience it has made me want to continue racign with the cheaper and lower class cars throughout my game time. To achieve a feat like that is not easy as many games have shown us.Because of how this game emplores an ""ariel view"" approach (not quite top down) you really get a chance to look around and admire the scenery created for this game and because you can constantly choose the track that you will play it stays interesting throughout. The difficulty modes means that whatever level gamer you are you can have fun and the rewards for the higher difficulties are not over exagurated, thus making this a balanced, fun and beautiful game.Of course this game also has achievements and trading cards and costs almost nothing at all. I would defintiely recomend giving it a go!"

Una semana después quise volver a jugar y el juego no iniciaba. Un par de meses después se me murió el disco duro del ordenador y me compré otro, reinstalando el sistema (Arch Linux), prové de nuevo sin éxito.En los foros, otros usuarios con Linux se quejan de lo mismo, parece que da igual la distro. Al cabo de mucho tiempo, un desarrollador dijo que era tema de librerías y puso un script para que prováramos, script que no funciona. Nunca más se supo del desarrollador.Es una pena, el juego molaba, pero parece que los desarrolladores se lavan las manos, así que yo de vosotros no perdía el tiempo,echadle un vistazo al hiloantes de comprar, a ver si ha habido solución o no.------------NOTIFICATION FOR STEAMOS/LINUX USERS: THE GAME STOPPED WORKING MONTHS AGOWell, this game is entertaining and quite addictive, I could enjoy it an entire afternoon with my friends. A week later I wanted to play again and the game did not start. A couple of months later my computer's hard drive died and I bought another one, reinstalling the system (Arch Linux), I tested the game again without success.In the forums, other users with Linux complain about the same, it seems the distro does not matter. After a long time, a developer said it seems the problem was the some native libraries and provided a script for us to test, script that does not work. No one saw that developer again.It's a shame, the game was cool, but it seems that the developers wash their hands, so I were you, I did not waste my time,at least take a look at the threadbefore buying, to see if there has been a solution or not."

Becareful how much you upgrade your car, you can make the mistake i did at first, and class up your car before you are ready. Luckily there is a downgrade feature which i think is very nice, you can downgrade the car to keep it within a certain class or to change how the car is set up.The graphics are nice, handling physics is a bit odd but fun once you get used to it. I'd say it is both a mix of sim, and arcade. You have to figure out a good rhythm for the corners. How you boost on the straights matters can mean loosing or winning a race. There is no penalty for restarting a race in Career mode that I've noticed which is nice until you learn a track. Some tracks have jumps, and blind corners.There is a difficulty setting which affects how much credits you win from a race. It is set to default on Intermediate, but even Easiest can be tricky depending on the track and car that you have. What is tricky about Easiest is that you lap slower cpu, and they can get in your way when taking some corners or on tight track sections. This is annoying if you are trying to do a perfect race without any damage.Controls, and rumble feature are very nicely set up, you can change them if the default setting isn't what you want. I play using a 360 Afterglow controller.Overall, first impressions say a lot. This is nicely done. I will update this review as i play it more and get indepth into other modes, and multiplayer."

,Not Recommended,262690,34060160,Posted: 6 August,all,Nez,"I liked this game a lot at first.... Then I had it for a few days and now I have a lot to say.1. The game has lackluster customization. Buy a car, pick a terrible texture, pick 2 colors. The end.2. There are multiple classes for races. The lower classes are more fun but have next to no return. More on this later.3. Multiplayer lacks any depth at all. You can't select what track you're racing on nor how many laps you're required to do.4. There is nothing to the game EXCEPT for racing. You'd think the Dev would add a ""battle mode"" or something with pickups.5. Devs: Add Split-screen multiplayer and this game could go places as a party game.6. Randomly, and I mean RANDOMLY, your car will stutter when turning and you'll slam into a wall, allowing the AI to pass you. (I think this is just poor geometry on some courses)7. Achievements and accomplishments are obviously shoehorned in. They're all ""win x races"" or ""come in x place"" or ""come in 1st with x car""8. The ranking system is useless. What is it for? Nothing but ""achievements"" which is for their REALLY lazy unlock system.9. The AI is trash. A rank races are all but impossible thanks to this and the very lazily implemented damage system. Remember how I said I'd come back to why lower rank races are more fun? It's because the AI isn't as fast so what happens in higher ranked games doesn't happen in the lower ranked games - that is, you either spend the whole race fighting with a single AI who keeps rubbing you (you always slow down, they never do) or you'll get ahead, take corners like a sane person and get SLAMMED into from behind and instantly wind up in last. The AI literally just balls the ♥♥♥♥ out in every. single. corner. No brakes. Slams into the walls, but maintains speed. If you slam into the wall the same way, your car either bounces in a cartoonish manner or you stop entirely while the AI keeps slamming into you (keeping you from moving) and all of them pass you.This game itself is fun, but the frustration outweighs the fun if you actually try to unlock/progress to the A rank races. Also, the ""campaign"" has what seems like a crappy selection of races that are just randomly chosen. You sold your lower tier cars for money to get an A rank car? Haha, jokes on you, there are no A races available until you complete one of the lower tier races.I almost forgot, the track conditions seem like an afterthought as well. Snow/rain just makes the AI somehow even ♥♥♥♥ing worse (though can make for some fun slippage) but the night/dusk ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t seem stupid considering I don't recall playing a single day race, so.... yeah.I played this game for 30 minutes, thought it was fun, bought 5 copies to give to friends and then later realized these problems. This game has a LOT of potential, but there is very little depth to the races as well. Maybe add some mild shortcuts to some of the tracks. Improve the player car outline when you're using the isometric camera (Half the time it just doesn't work at all). Add a battle mode & multiplayer splitscreen. Improve the AI so that instead of relying on them being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to give the player a chance (and inadvertantly doing the opposite) they just become viable yet realistic racers. Add more customization - the wheels are a ♥♥♥♥ing texture. That can't be hard to change. Maybe add an in-depth texture paint feature for the models since the textures are low-quality garb anyways. Make the ranking system mean more than just ""win races, advance!"" maybe add other kinds of achievements. (Maybe rehash the movement a bit in the game with the ability to spin your tires, better implementation of the handbrake since it's currently essentially useless) I dunno.Ultimately, I do not regret buying this game or the copies for friends, but it feels like the skeleton of something great. I will gladly change my review from thumbs down to up if the Devs take a little more interest in the game and polish it up."

I spent an hour in the game when I first got it, and for some reason steam didn't track it*I really enjoy racing games, which is why I picked up Little Racers STREET. However, this game lacks any sort of depth or interesting tracks to make me want to come back for more. The game has a very cool concept, tiny cars racing. I'm sure its been done before, but it really wasn't done well here in my opinion. The sound assets leave something to be desired, and the enviornment around the tracks seems like it was made in minutes instead of hours. The game is also prone to situations where turning can either be extremely fun, or it can ruin a race for you do to horrible hit boxes on the edges of the street. Its ended up ruining a lot of races for meA lot of people claim the game has several different maps. While technically true, they are really just the same map redesigned over and over again. I'd say the game has 4 different maps, maybe a few more. A lot of tracks are just different variations of the same environment. Another big issue I have is the difficulty. Medium is extremely easy, I found myself beating every single race with little to no challenge. Hard is a decent challenge, and insane is really the mode you want to play on if you choose to pick this game up. I've yet to win a race on insane, its pretty difficult. But the other modes are just far to easy.This is a solid racing game, but it lacks any sort of depth at all. It is fairly cheep, so if you enjoy racing games it probably wouldn't hurt to pick this game up. But if you're like me, and your looking for great tracks, a great online community, and in depth racing, I'd look elsewere.Pros:-Up to 12 cars in a race-Decent career mode-CheapCons:-Poor car design-Weak race tracks-Uninspired evironments-Boring AI-Easy on low difficulty-Dead online community(Already)-Turning mechanics can ruin a race-Short Races"

Buy it.It's not a simulator, it's very arcade-sy but it has a great physics engine and is fun to play the whole time.  You keep getting better and better and then progressing through to more advanced classes where the cars are faster thus making it more challenging.  You buy cars, upgrade them, paint them, and fill up your ""garage"", but they have made it interesting by upping the class of a vehicle that has enough points.  This means there are only so many points you can allocate to a vehicle before it is in the higher class where it won't perform as well.  You end up buying a couple of the same car so you can have one focused on steering, another one focused at high speed, and so on, and maybe another one that has progressed to the higher class.The way campaign races work is great, too.  You are presented with a bunch of available races from all of the available classes.  You might be all the way up to the 'B' or 'A' class cars, but there are still available 'E', 'D' and 'C' class races to do, so it lets you continue to use the older vehicles you have in the garage.The new daily challenge thing is cool too, every day you get a race to do that is only available for that day, and everyone in the world is basically playing it to get the fastest lap, and whoever has the current fastest is the ghost that everyone chases while they play.  It shows you the world ranking too, it's awesome to know you how close you are to the best time.  Maybe one day the data from these race times will mean something.  It's sort of a new feature, it would be cool to have on your profile (# of daily challenges entered, # of 1st place, the dates, or something like that).One thing I would have to say is annoying is paying to repair your car later on (with in-game money, taken off the of the race winnings).  Initially you drive so slow that you rarely need to think about the repair cost but the 'B' and 'A' class cars are VERY fast.  The AI is also really good in these classes so you have to push it to the limit, and bumping into the sides causes your vehicle damage, more-so the faster you are going.  Also your vehicle starts to go slower because of the damage, causing a great disadvantage.  Sometimes 50% of the prize money from a race is going to repairs.

That experience has triggered me to try this game out.I bought LRS on a sale, but yet think I really overpayed for it. Yes, this game looks pretty good, it doesn't need great graphics.

This game was cheap so I decided to give it a go. And it was worth it. With different camera angles you can actually get different feels for the racing, being my favorite the sort of top down Micro Machines style camera, for nostalgia sake.You get different car and customization options. But don’t go full hog on the cars. You get great cars just by completing some races, but races are restricted by car ranks. So if you have one low rank car and upgrade it several times it can change rank, and then you don’t have the ability to do some races. Also, some objectives require particular brands of cars, so try to pace yourself on your upgrades.Money isn’t much of a problem. When you get the top cars you’ll be able to get in races that give equivalent money to the rank you’re on.Also there’s drifting. And you’ll need to master it."

It's a great casual little game that is fun to play for half an hour or so at a go. I find myself coming back to it every six months or so when I feel like some quick and simple arcade fun.The premise is simple, you can buy cars, upgrade them, and race them in short races against a varying number of opponents. The races have different weather conditions that affect the handling of your car. The better you do in a race, the more money you win for buying new cars and/or upgrade your current cars. There's also different classes of cars, and upgrading a car can put it into a higher tier. That's pretty much it.The tracks are generally pretty similar, and take place on a number of shared maps with different routes for the different races. As the name says, you are racing on streets (i.e. not a for-purpose race track) and the courses tend to combine several straights and several sharp turns, with some tracks more winding than others.Car handling is decent and arcadey, as befits the genre, and you have a nitro that slowly recharges over time and is best used on the long straights. Your car also has a damage metre that rises as you crash into the environment or when you drop from a height, a feature on a few of the courses. The more damage you do to your car during the race, the more money is deducted from your earnings to repair your car.There's also online multiplayer, but I have never tried it, so I can't comment on that.I see a lot of references to old-school arcade racers, and Little Racers STREET is very much in the same vein. Personally it reminds me a lot of Supercars (sans weapons and with a different camera view) and Skidmarks (especially the semi-isometric perspective and car handling). At any rate, if you enjoy casual arcade racers, I say give this one a whirl. Just don't expect anything deep and revolutionary."

I love the cars and the different types. They all handle very differently and nicely and you can have lots of different camera angles for the one that suits you best.The game can get repetitive, and that is why I mainly only play it for an hour here and there, though, of course, it is a great game to play for ten minutes here and there.The levels mainly occur in the night and the environment is very bright and positive. Each course is new and out of the 180 races I have played so far, I can say that I have only had about 10 or so races that are the same.The cars are really nicely done and are great copies of real world cars. I like the idea of having to buy cars to go into events to complete the objectives you have.The only negative things I can say so far is the fact that when you nudge into an AI car, you will, 9 times out of 10, get slowed down and the AI car will speed up, even if they hit you. Also, the damage the A and B class cars take is really harsh, and every time I complete a race I lose about 3/4’s of the money for taking damage. I have found this quite a problem as at the start of the race, the AI like to crash into you during turns, and the car takes a lot of damage at that point.All in all, a very nicely polished and laid out game.

So I have at least 30 hours now.]This game is a mix between Need For Speed Underground and Micro Machines or Re-Volt.You control a little car through two fictional cities and race against a maximum of 12 oponents. These races are divided into five classes :- E class : good enough to learn the basics, you start from scratch here with basic cars. You'll learn to upgrade your car through Power, Turning, Grip, Nitro sections as it fits to your playstyle. Also, you'll see that the weather will affect the drivability : clear, rain, snow. You can upgrade an E-class car to make it a D class. Note that the names of the cars are fictional but refer to real cars. It's easy to recognize.- D class : this class gains some speed and more cars dedicated to street racing. It's a good step if you want to race without too much difficulty.- C class : I think this is where the real game starts. The cars have more speed and are dedicated to sport. You have to balance the speed and the handling to make smooth cornering because this game is about precision and drift. The corners in this game can be very hard to take and force you to have a clean drive. Furthmore, if you increase the difficulty of the AI (Easiest, Easy, Medium by default, then Hard and Unfair) you'll notice that any bad trajectory will be a pain.- B class : the real challenge I think. You can only have intense races in this class.- A class : you know what you'll have against you...the prestige cars.You'll have to win the races to gain money. Basic thing. But you can win money even if you are at the last place. Also, you can damage your car in this game. And damage equals repairs. But don't worry, the cost is about 80% of the car value. In other words, you'll always earn money. You can also earn benefits through the pack of challenges that push you to your limits : ""reach the 1st place for 15 races in X class...""But what make this game really good ?- Number of cars : very various ones, even a van is outhere. Also you can upgrade (through 5 levels) or downgrade your car and change the style. Feel free to change the skin also !- Number of events : when you'll reach the A class, go to Time Trial and choose a track. You'll notice the number of tracks in this game...nearly 300 or 400, I didn't checked all, but enough to keep you in the game.- Time trial with ghosts : I think it's a simple but always good point to make you challenging yourself through time attack sessions.- AI : the bots will be agressive and will not hesitate to push you against the wall. While the AI is not really clean some times, it offers good challenge. I experimented very good duels against the bots and they make you feel like they really want to win this race. Note : I'm note a really good player, I play on medium difficulty.The bad points :- No custom Quick Race : there is a Quick Race that jumps you directly into a random track but I really like the Single Race in racing games where you can change some settings as you wish. But this point is in some point solved by the fact that the career generates random tracks for you (depending on which class car you have).- Camera : the default camera is really good, makes the feeling that you are watching a race from a TV chopper. But you can't really anticipate the track sometimes, when you are at fullspeed for instance. So you'll have to switch to another camera mode, the one behind the car (3rd person view style) making the other modes obsolete.- Multiplayer dead : if you want to play with some friends, you can but don't expect to find many people playing this online. I hope this game will be more famous and bring more people. It deserves it.- Not mod friendly : in my opinion, independant games like this should be mod-friendly to keep the game alive. Make more cars, cities, tracks or sounds mods ? Why not ?Gameplay : pretty good with keyboard, should be the same with a pad (didn't try it). The game is designed to make the car drift at every corner. If you don't like this style, it may be awkward to you.Sound : the sounds are basic but ok. I like the music, it has a Gran Turismo style in it.Graphism : don't expect to have top graphics rendering for a game like this. But I think it's really beautiful by its simplicity. The game is fluid and you don't need a last generation computer to play this.Length : hundred of races, a lot of challenges, daily challenges also, time trial, free roam, quick race...You will be busy like the other one on steam who made an evaluation of this game who played nearly 500 hours in this game. But the some of you will certainly find this game really repetitive.Conclusion : if you like top down racing games or racing games in general with Street Racing Ambiance and CHEAP ones with a decent content in it, this game if for you. Some players argued that this game lacks of story mode. A racing game doesn't need a story but a good/fun gameplay. And the developpers made this point clear by making the races really intense with good AI, short but intenses tracks depending on the weather, fast and different cars, original camera angles. Also, this game is really cheap. I don't think you'll find a good opponent on this one. This genre of game should be more developped and Little Racers STREET may be a precursor to the revival of the Micro Machines genre.Edit : the game has no end. If you reach the 1st place on the ranking, it's not over. I lost some races after that and became 2nd behind Pisani."
