Worth it just for the princess' dark wit.The game is fairly short and suits casual players (normal difficulty) and more experienced gamers (hard mode) especially if you try for the Freerunner achievement without buying the glider, wings or hoverboard.There is some replayability with more than one ending, a Par for each level in number of deaths, time taken, and currency collected, and the Steam achievements. It's also fun to play through it again just to re-read the princess' messages; you might find a couple that you overlooked the first time.You should expect to die a lot at first, but this is part of the fun. ""Make them like this"" will be your motto."

Though I haven't gotten to the tougher parts yet, the simple level design and even simpler story elements add a very tight and streamlined feel to this game. The writtings on the wall are hilarious and present a really fresh twist on effective story telling I have not seen in a while (maybe since the Ratman in Portal)."

,Recommended,262770,8661597,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,Seabeast,"What is Freedom Fall?Freedom Fall is a down-scrolling indie platformer set in a very tall prison tower. You are a prisoner who is trying find your way down to the bottom of the tower through all the traps set up by a twisted princess. The goal is to get your freedom back by escaping the tower.The writings on the walls in the tower are funny and drives the story forward as you get to know more about the princess. If you are any kind of fan of the platformer genré then you should definitively try to pick this game up. The game is for Windows and Mac which is always nice and the replay value of the game is pretty good since you can try to improve your scores and times for the levels. As far as I'm aware there are two different endings you can get decided by which way you go in the tower.At the time of writing this review the achievements are glitched but I'm sure they will fix that soon[EDIT: They have indeed fixed it]. The menu screen is good and you can have a few different save files. I personally like the art style and level design in this game and these kind of games are right up my alley. The game has full controller support but I haven't had time to try it out with a controller yet and the keyboard controls work just fine.Another part of this game that I enjoyed was that you can choose between harder platforming and easier platforming.The harder platforming rewards you with more cogs than in the easier parts, cogs which are the in-game currency that you can use to buy equipment like a pair of dragon wings or a glider. As the game progresses it gets harder but even if you aren't very good at platformer games it shouldn't get too hard and it is not a game that frustrates you as for example Super Meat Boy.Conclusion:As a conclusion I would like to say that I recommend this game with all my heart even though it is a bit short but as I stated above the game has good enough replay value for me to still really recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good time. The music is nice and fitting for the game and there are also trading cards which everyone always seem to like :)- Liam"

This is a nice little falling obsticle course. Basically you're trying to escape a tower prison built by a sadistic princess who has a hateful admiration of you. You learn all about her and her kind of sad life by reading the things she scribbles on the wall for you as you're well..trying not to die...again..and again..and again. You're immortal so it doesn't really matter, except for your score in that level of course. So good luck dealing with the sadistic princess with mother..and some father issues."

Some of them take some head scratching but they are enjoyably hard. The humor is also quite fun, I would recommend spending you're first play through reading the wall writings.There are also multiple endings (I won't spoil the ones I've found, but there are many of them).Cons - I did notice the story on it's own is maybe around 3 hours long if you're casually playing it, and I've seen some leaderboard scores of finishing the game in about 1 hour. (redeemable with the ""New Game+"" features and replayability).Overall, this is a good game for an afternoon game time."
,Recommended,262770,8690396,"Posted: 13 January, 2014",all,kitsunekitsu,"Let me start by saying that I've been avidly awaiting this game's release on Steam for quite some time, so I might be a bit biased about it.Now onto the review itself.Freedom Fall is fun and charming, if a little frustrating at parts. The music is about as unobtrusive as you can get, while still adding to the mood, and fits the levels very well. The art (my initial draw into this game as I follow the art director on a popular art site) is VERY well done and the animations are smooth and natural. Marsh is adorable, our dear little Highness the Princess is beautifully handled, and everything just has this almost childlike charm to it.The design choice of telling the story through graffiti on the wall is excellent in ways I cannot describe.But there is a reason I said that its frustrating. While the gameplay is smooth and the default controls are solid (though personally I would have had the three glider types set to A, S, and D rather than having to change between them in a loop with C) I keep hitting X when I mean to hit C and C when I mean to hit V and there are times where you only have a split second time frame or have to jump from a specific pixel in order to have the slightest chance of successfully completing the jump. Compared to the fluid ease of the rest of the game, these specific parts quickly become frustrating and irritating. This is made even worse by the large hitbox on obstacles in later levels (to a brutal extent in the bonus level).Early on, these parts are a nice challenge, but in the later stages it it quickly becomes apparent why this game doesn't use lives.However, even with those issues, Freedom Fall is a nice, short game that can be completed in an hour if you know what you're doing, and three tops if you don't. Its a fun game well worth picking up and more than worth the money.Do be warned of some bugs that myself and my friends have encountered.I'm using a MacBook Pro OSX:-I have encountered random temporary ""hiccups"" in loading (all animation will cease for about half a second). These did not affect my gameplay but they are a thing.-On my second play through I got caught in a Lightning trap and was returned to a redstone as expected, however Marsh was stuck in the electrocuted animation loop. I did not attempt to replicate this bug, I simply restarted the level.My PC using friends:-For one of my friends, Freedom Fall will fail to open. Steam will claim it is open, and Freedom Fall will claim its open, but it cannot be located. I'm unsure how he fixed this, if he did, but restarting Steam did not help.-Another friend had the game crash in the middle of the fight against Madam Sharkie Twinkletooth the 3rd. We do not know what caused it to crash, and she could not replicate it.-Around the ""You weren't supposed to get this far"" graffiti, the same friend's screen bugged out again, slowing down and moving Marsh to the side of the screen and going completely unresponsive. She had to close the game and reopen it to fix it, and we're not sure what was done to cause this."
,Recommended,262770,8688986,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,Alice,"In a similar sub-breed of platformer as Super house of dead ninjas, freedom fall is a vertical drop platformer. With a garnish of super meat boy style difficulty. However while the platformer is difficult in areas, the difficulty curve comes too late in the game and mostly in the bonus level that appears after the game. On death you respawn at the last check point you passed and getting to the end of the level can be broken down into simply brute forcing it with failures. Only during the bonus level and a few select time rewind based check points do you actually get denied progress if you do not successfully do well enough to beat the puzzle set. I felt this mechanic could have been utilised sooner and in a much broader way to give much further depth to the earlier levels. Instead the main game plays fairly quickly and the only real challenge is in earning the awards for beating the level under a par set for time completed, deaths and amount of items collected.The game has a nice aesthetic with clean HD graphics and a cute story that plays out through writing on the wall narrative. A one sided conversation between the protagonist and antagonist. The antagonists personality however is a little disjointed with the way she writes and the way she acts at the end of the game.Tentatively Recommended: A fun game that ends before it can realize it's potential."

It's generally just really enjoyable: the music, the humor, and the art are all top-notch. Combine the fun factor with both the difficulty of the game and the achievements (multiple endings, beating the game without dying), and the lifespan of the game continues to grow. I've put about 21 hours into it and just now finished up all the achievments/got all the endings, and I'm still planning on playing it again just because it's fun."

The art is well done, the controls work well and consistently, and the level design is interesting if not particularly inspired.Probably the most engaging part of the game is the way it conveys it's story, limited as it is.  None of the characters speak, instead the tower's designer communicates with you through the scrawled grafitti which litter the levels.  Many of these messages are rather ammusing, and putting together the bits of background they offer to work out what's going on was an engaging exercise.For completionists, there are three medals to be earned in each level, gained by attaining par scores for loot collected, time spent, and deaths.  Failing to obtain these medals will not hinder you from moving forward though, so they serve as extras for those interested rather than barriers for those who are not.One runthrough will probably only take a couple hours, though there is a branching point in the story late game that will entice some to replay simply to see how things play out if a different choice is made.  the replay value will depend on how much you enjoy the platforming and the idea of trying to hit leaderboards or just beat personal challenges.Overall, it's certainly worth a try."
,Recommended,262770,28727973,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,IUserious,"Great platforming game where instead of the right side of the screen being the objective, it's descending a huge and seemingly endless tower. You're a prisoner who has been let out of your cell and you can receive pardon if you can escape the tower without dying.The game has great visual language in terms of letting you know exactly how you need to jump and fall without dying, and the challenge of course is controlling the character in that way. Which is easier than it sounds of course, because although the controls are really tight, the challenge is in timing and spacing to avoid spikes, fire, and other hazards.I also like all the graffiti written on the walls. This princess isn't your typical cutesy damsel in distress, she's actually sadistically entertained by you and other prisoners who try to get out of the tower alive. Her messages are scrawled all across the levels to mock you and poke fun at you, and there's just something about it that makes you wanna get out of the tower faster so you can kick her in the♥♥♥♥♥♥for being such a snooty ♥♥♥♥♥.In an endearing kid of way of course...Highly recommend it.

I picked it up this morning and and have just started playing but it definately seems like an entertaining game, even just to pass the time. The entirety of the descent is broken up into smaller playable 'levels', so you don't have to concern yourself with not making progress each time you open it.So far it seems like it could be very addictive, I myself am keen to see what is the next level down, as slowly more ways to die are introduced, and avoiding them made more tricky.Very playable, very simple and made more entertaining by the writing on the walls as you descend. I recommend to anyone who has a few bucks laying around and likes to jump into something to pass the time, or anyone who likes a quick laugh at excruciatingly painful deaths.

It could have been longer, it could have had puzzles, it could have had more notes and storytelling, it could have had more character development even; but that is asking too much of what was originally a mobile game."

The art style is amazing as well as the humor though most of the jokes have been done before and better. The main story will take a casual player about an hour and a half, maybe less. There is a bonus level that is pretty fun and cute but unless I am missing something that is all there is to the game.One other let down is the controls, they are very contextual and because of this you may find yourself getting needlessly killed.Its just a shame, this game was so close to being an amazing experiance, instead it just because a overpriced way to kill an afternoon and forever gather dust in my steam library."

I had high hopes for it and I've been awaiting the day of release on Steam feverishly.  The day came.  And not only that, but in celebration it was on SALE.  And not to far from my birthday, so I could excuse the purchase as a ""Early gift to myself"".  Awesome!It installs... And I run it.  Instantly I'm hit with beautifully painted and animated scenes and awesome music that I wish I could listen to outside of the game (WAV/ALAC/FLAC/etc OST please?).  The effort that went into the whole game is clear from the very beginning and I LIKE that in a game, indie title or not, and is something sorely missing from most modern games, I think.When I beat it, I at first felt disappointed because it was over ""so quickly"".  But then I looked at the clock; 2 hours had passed.  I mean, okay, lets be honest, two hours ISN'T huge.  But I thought it was less than half that.  This says more about the quality of the game than I can with an essay of words.  It pulled me in like a good book, wrapped me tight around it's little finger, and time seemed to pass at incredible pace.  I plan on playing it again, and soon.  Maybe I'll buy it for my Nexus 7, too.The game itself is simple, platformer-like, and quick to grasp.  That said, it's not easy to master, and some levels may have you bald very quickly, depending on how quickly you rip your hair out in frustration.  One level, I'm ashamed to admit, had me dead 86 times.  That said, I don't think I've played a game in this style that I enjoyed this much in a long time (Unless it was an original game produced in the 80's/90's).  This is a game that will someday be mentioned in the same breath as all the retro classics and will have a special place all it's own among them.Oh, and the first ending I got seemed to play at a possible sequel...

Freedom Fall is a non stop challenge that maintains fun all the way to the end.  The right amount of challenge without ever being frustrating.  Love the art style and the story as played out by the wall writings remains fresh and enjoyable throughout.  I played the game from start to finish using a 360 controller and it played fantastic.  Hightly recommended.

Also, the taunts the Princess makes toward the player throughout the game are a nice tough.  Overall a very fun game, albeit with a few frustrating moments (the shark boss comes to mind); also multiple paths that can be taken through the levels as well as various challenges for time, least deaths, etc. make for some decent replay value in spite of the shortness of the game.Definitely worth checking out!"

With quirky little humor thrown in and a nice backstory that seems to twist and turn at times it tends to keep you wanting to get to the next level. The gameplay is fast paced, very forgiving when it comes to dieing, and even has an arcade like scoring to it for those highscore buffs. I recommend it to those who like drop-down platformers with a sense of humor!Only downside is it is a quick game to beat, took maybe three to four hours to beat, but it is a joy ride to play while you do it."

It's a novel twist on those tower climbing games.This time around instead of trying to climb up you're trying to escape by climbing or should that be floating down. Each levels descent is judged on time taken , deaths accrued and cogs that have been collected.I'm not a great platformer but finished it in one play through taking about 90 mins the global leader board shows some people took less than 45. So don't expect this to take up too much time but the replay value in trying to better your own existing scores or global ones are neat. Graphically the games clean and bright, and the humour within the game from one of tha protagonists is really well done.Only issue I had is with the game sometimes crashing on startup but the process continuing to run. This required me to hunt down the running process and shut it down, a check on the forums assisted here.Stirfire seem to be another one of these indie developer's that appears out of nowhere with an absolute cracker of a title.

,Recommended,262770,8670157,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,okram2k,"Freedom Fall is a pretty looking game that seems to involve… falling for your freedom. And it doesn’t disappoint, the game is an exquisitely crafted, easy on the eyes, smooth platformer in which you escape from death row by navigating an ever perilous descent out of a deadly tower.Really, this game is pretty. Perhaps because I have been playing some games that have been disregarding graphics lately but I really enjoyed the visuals in Freedom Fall. The towering heights, the deadly spikes and spinning blades, the cloudy backgrounds, and best of all the graffiti scrawled around the tower. You’re treated to some equally impressive visuals if you make it to the bottom and looking around at this fantastical world.So the justice system in this strange world involves locking people up in insanely high towers and then giving them the option to wait in their cell and be executed or attempt to find freedom by navigating a fairly suicidal descent. It’s a brilliant premise and I really am almost gushing at how brilliantly the story is told in this game. Developers and game designers take some notes here! A way to tell a fairly deep and engrossing story without heavy handed cut scenes or dialogue boxes and never interrupting the flow of game-play.The princess in the tower is not some damsel in distress that needs rescuing nor a helpful guide that you might think she is at first. No she is a monstrous, murderous, malevolent creature who has designed this mad death trap for her own amusement. Although you’ve thrown a wrench into her intricate mechanism by your uncanny ability to resurrect quickly after each of your painful deaths. I guess that’s why you got locked up to begin with, stealing (or being framed for stealing) the elixir of life, making you immortal.You might be immortal but there’s plenty of ways to send you back to the nearest resurrection shrine throughout your descent. The variety of deadly traps is quite impressive with spikes, blades, scythes, flames, fireballs, water, electricity, killer mechanical shark, and a dragon all out to kill you. The levels keep coming at you with more and more challenges but it’s not so frantic and unforgiving that you want to quit. The best feature is the game quickly resurrecting you, not wasting time on monotonous death scenes or loading screens and instead throws you right back into the action to try again when you fail. And you will fail a lot. A LOT!The only problem I really have with the game is it’s short length. Once you’ve gotten used to the various death traps and mastered the upgrades you’re fighting the final boss and then it’s over. Taking my time I beat the game in a little over an hour, then played again trying to go faster and beat it in under 50 minutes. Despite it’s short length and price tag though I was really satisfied by this game. It is highly concentrated goodness that delivers. Better to make a really good short game than a really long, drawn out, bad game.I recommend if you pick this game up to go slow your first time, read all the notes from the princess, the story that is told is really worth it. Then after you beat the game once, try again going as fast as you can for some extra challenge. I got a nice thrill testing my blade avoiding parkour skills as I tried to beat the game a third time as fast as possible while trying to die as few times as possible. And with a built in leader board you can compare your skills with all of the internet for bragging rights. I can understand not wanting to pay the full price for a game that can be completed in under an hour but at its current 35% off sale it’s definitely worth it!Final Score:Graphics: 9/10Game Play: 9/10Music / Ambiance: 8/10Story: 9/10Value: 5/10Overall: 8/10Read more of my indy game reviews on my blog!http://markofithian.com"

You go about this by falling. Freely. Ahem, anyway as you fall through the tower you'll have to dodge flaming pits, spiky walls, and a whole manner of other deadly traps along the way.To help you along the way you'll collect nuts, bolts, and gears which can be spent to create permanent power-ups to help you down the tower with a few gameplay quirks built in as well. For example, a glider can be built which slows your fall a bit but more importantly lets you rise upwards off of the heat the fire traps put off. I will say personally though that the power-ups make the game a bit too easy, but they aren't neccessary to finishing any of the game's levels.The story of the game is presented to you by way of a princess leaving you snarky and sarcastic messages on walls. I personally find this really charming and as the story picks up a little under half way through the game it also gets very interesting to learn just how you came to be in this tower, and who this princess is.All in all, while the game is really short and a bit easy it's made up for by being incredibly charming and super polished in gameplay.
