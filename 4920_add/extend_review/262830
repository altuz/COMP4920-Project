But the Steam version is a serious step backwards. New graphics and not as pretty, new UI is bland and forgettable, and the worst crime of all - the Perks are gone from the quest mode. That's right, they only exist in Survival, which I know some people don't even play.You would be much better suited by playing the original version 1.9.8."

Here are some awesome features:- 55 perks- 30 unique weapons- Four-player local co-op !!!- Five game mods- A quest mod equipped with six chapters- Tearing the enemies to shreds with versatile guns and huge amounts of blood.While all of these features are awesome, the game also comes with some drawbacks:- obsolete graphics and some huge empty and a bit boring arenas- the absence of perks in the Quest mode; they are present only in the Survival mode- basic methods of enemy grouping, well-known gameplay- unbalanced difficulty in some Survival mode situations, where a huge wave of enemies attacks that is impossible to be destroyed- occasional spawning of the enemies on the top of the player, which results in instant deathIt is still golden in many regards, and it has lots of content.

,Not Recommended,262830,12445814,"Posted: 11 October, 2014",all,Kaein,"This game has a lot going for it...but not enough.Lets start with the positives:I love the updated graphics, the new perks, the more streamlined leveling system, the ability to have four players at once, and many other details about this reboot of the classic crimsonland. Killing enemies is as fun as ever and almost every weapon is great and feels good for different situations (except you blowtorch!) and has a legitimate strategy. Perks are incredibly important and add a deep aspect of thought to the game (Do I get regeneration to keep my health up or choose fast reloader so I can kill enemies more?) and the sheer addictive nature of the gameplay will keep you hooked. Its a solid title...or should be...Which leads me to the negatives:Outside of the story mode this game isn't really as fun as it used to be. They took out a lot of things that made it fun. In solo survival the average player can expect to get to level 8-9 if they get a decent weapon before being absolutely annihilated by the hordes of enemies. If you add friends to the mix the difficulty ramps up even more and you will be lucky if you clear level 6. Its almost a broken level of hard. Theres no fighting it. No matter which perks you pick or which weapons you have the survival mode reaches a certain point early on that just immediately kills you.Your choices feel useless and it becomes kind of a drag when you get the perfect weapon combo with the perfect perks and then you just get slaughtered anyways by the sudden wave of splitting spiders and zombie lords that surround you out of thin air instead of coming out of the sides of the screen like they used to. The previous version of crimsonland slowly spiked the difficulty more and more making the survival last longer. It really felt like you were, you know, surviving?This version of crimsonland has no such subtlety or flair. They let you gain a couple levels and then just murder you outright with a frustrating amount of enemies that are impossible to fight. Let me put it to you this way. I was the 3rd highest ranking player IN THE WORLD in the previous crimsonland but in this one I can barely top level 10 in solo survival. They have taken one of the greatest and most fun modes of the game and just smashed it and made it unplayable. If they had a difficulty choice I think it could mitigate this. This is the only game I think actually NEEDS an easy mode.Another thing that is absolutely broken in this game is the enemy spawning system. In the previous crimsonland enemies came out of all 4 sides of the screen giving you a chance to plan ahead. You could see a horde of zombies and decide which way you want to bait them to try and get an opening to dive for that powerup or weapon. You can find the big monster that is spawning little ones and put that sucker down before he overwhelms you.This crimsonland has destroyed that too. It is quite common now to have enemies spawn on top of you and immediately kill you. Nothing sucks worse than to be 10 minutes into a boss battle and to be killed by a horde of tiny red aliens spawning right on top of you. Or to be doing a survival round with your favorite weapon and perks and to have a lizard king spawn right next to you and one shot you instantly. Its painfully frustrating and can make you want to chuck your keyboard across the room. It has happened to me in almost every mission of this game and is the most common way to die. Some enemies still come out of the sides of the screen, but more than half of them just appear with a flash wherever they feel like regardless of how inconvient it is for you.So in conclusion, the game is fun but ultimately frustrating and not worth your money. They could have had a solid remake of a fun arcade shooter on their hands but they've instead destroyed it by breaking the difficulty and spawning and made it virtually unplayable. If you do buy this game, you'll discover its fun palls rather quickly because of its major stumbling blocks. It is a shadow of its former self and if you want to play a fun arcade shooter, download the first one online someplace (a few places host it for free) and have yourself a grand old time.But skip this version. Its just not fun anymore."

Well actually that's not true; I tried the demo once and the game didn't really seem like anything special. After reading some great impressions from a friend, I decided to check out this new and improved Crimsonland and I'm very glad I did. It's addictive, bloody, intense, and just one hell of a fun satisfying shooter.In terms of story and gameplay, Crimsonland is as simple as can be. You and hordes of hundreds and hundreds of creatures on the battlefield, kill them all. But while the actual mechanics are not complex, Crimsonland adds a layer of strategy underneath the run and gun gameplay, turning a game that might seem shallow from the screenshots into a compelling thrilling experience. Every moment consists of countless decisions. Which gun is best for the current situation? Should I rush for that power-up but risk having to run through a horde to reach it? Which order should I use power-ups? Which perks should I choose?I think the most interesting aspect is how the varied enemies require you to totally change your tactics and influences the weapons and perks you'd want to use. It's not like some shooters where you can just get the most powerful weapon and kill everything. If you're facing fast spiders that replicate when they die, then you're going to want a weapon that's accurate and precise but that fires and reloads fast enough that they won't close the gap, and power-ups that focus on crowd control and defense. Hordes of zombies? You'll want to go for the spray and pray type weapons or explosives and all-out offensive power-ups. Thankfully your arsenal is just as varied as the enemies you face. Weapons range from a simple pistol and shotgun to all manner of flamethrowers, plasma cannons, automatic weapons, and even more exotic weapons. Power-ups slow time, shield you from damage, restore health, imbue your weapon with devastating plasma energy. The RPG-esque perk system offers diverse ways to customize your playstyle. Sacrifice health for damage, move faster, have more ammo, poison enemies, gain a melee attack, and many more perks make each survival attempt feel fresh and excitingCrimsonland is a must play for top-down shooter fans. Besides the 60-mission campaign (and three difficulty levels), you can test your skills across several survival modes, all of which adds its own twist of the core gameplay. The visuals and effects are stylish, the gameplay is deeper than you'd might expect, and seeing the screen literally turn red with blood and gore as you mow down hundreds of creatures is very satisfying."

,Not Recommended,262830,10432597,"Posted: 11 June, 2014",all,OfficialSkyPiglet,"Pretty disappointed by this ""remake""... if you could even call it that. This game has some new perks and a few new game modes, but that's about all that is new.  All of the sound effects and music, for example, are 100% reused from the original-- in 2003, this kind of audio quality was acceptable, but in 2014, it feels tinny and underwhelming, especially with regards to the music, which sounds like it was saved and then resaved as lossy 64kbps mp3s. The graphics are pretty much the same as well, just barely updated for wide screen resolutions. This is such a non-remake, in fact, that the flavor text for perks is exactly the same, poor English included! In 2003, coming from a tiny indie dev, this was acceptable. But to have this in 2014, from what is now a well established, modestly successful casual PC and mobile developer...that's just shameful and embarassing. (If you've played any of 10tons' games on iPhone or Android, that is the kind of quality I expected.)Now for the new gameplay-- for some reason, someone thought that it would be a good idea to remove perks entirely from the Quest mode. This is such a poor decision. A major part of the 2003 game's charm was getting to make choices and develop your character gradually over the course of each level, with a clear progression in your power as the enemies became stronger and more numerous. Now the quest mode is just a boring grindfest in which the only interesting choices are when to pick up a powerup, and whether to use a shotgun or a plasma rifle. What's worse is that the game forces you play through this quest mode in order to unlock the guns and perks for use in survival mode, which does let you choose perks and develop your character. It's a poor design choice to force your players to trudge through a boring mode so that they can better succeed in the more fun game mode. Please change this back to the way it was!Perhaps the biggest feature of this ""remake"" is the introduction of achievements, but half of them are predictable, ""complete chapter 1 of quest mode"", ""complete chapter 2"", type achievements. There's also one achievement which is particularly irritating for completionists like myself-- the ""no damage"" achievement. You now earn a star for each Quest mode level you complete without taking damage, and you have to collect one from every level to get the achievement. Sounds simple, right? Not when your character now moves at 80% of the speed they used to, your success on a level is heavily dependent upon which gun drops from the first monster, and the poor level design is such that monsters sometimes spawn right on top of you (this was rarely an issue in the original). This achievement also goes against everything the original was about: wading into mobs of aliens like a badass, and shrugging them off as you blow them away. To actually get every star for this achievement, you would have to restart your game hundreds, if not thousands of times. Meanwhile, you have to play the game as a super perfectionist SHMUP where you die instantly, rather than the messy, Smash TV style slaughterfest it is meant to be.Lastly, the UI...I don't know why they decided to change this. In the 2003 game, your health and ammo were shown in the top left corner, in a bar with a black background. You could clearly see how much health you had, and how much ammo you had remaining in your clip. In this remake, they moved it to the aiming reticle, converting the health to a very small blue circle around you, and the ammo to a blue number next to the crosshair. While this does mean you don't have to shift your eyes away from the battle to see your stats, the tiny graphics and the light blue coloring are a pain to read, and they often blend right into the scenery or your enemies.Unless they patch this game to make it more interesting and closer to the original, I can't recommend it. You will have much more fun with the 2003 version, believe me! And it costs almost the same. I was SO excited about this remake. I wanted badly to love it, and I was looking forward to improvements to the original. Instead, I got a product that is actually worse, and that feels like it was rushed in a month or two for the sake of a money grab.Edit: The devs have made a post in the Steam discussion forums about how they did include a hidden option to unlock perks in the main Quest mode by typing ""grim"" at the menu. However, this doesn't solve the deeper underlying issue, which is the super short Quest levels (and to a lesser extent, the poor level design). The original Crimsonland was about starting weak then growing in power over time. The length of these levels is so short that this feeling of progression has been greatly diminished.  So while it's a band-aid, it doesn't fix the actual cause.  This feature (one that shouldn't be hidden, btw) also doesn't make up for the generally poor production values and other issues, such as the unclear UI.Edit 2: typos"
,Not Recommended,262830,14368372,"Posted: 7 February, 2015",all,Netsu,"I played quite a lot of the original Crimsonland and while the updated graphics and new perks are appreciated, for me the main reason to play was always the survival mode. And in this revamped version it just isn't that much fun because the usual game lasts only around 6 level-ups. This is not enough to work towards any consistent perk+weapon set-up. In the original you could always try new combinations and you felt like they really mattered, but here? After reaching level 6 or 7 I am always overwhelmed no matter what I try and my only hope is to keep on hitting power-ups like plasma overload or fire bullets.This is another problem, fire bullets used to enhance the weapon you use but now they are almost like a weapon of their own. The same goes for the plasma power-up that is new. This means that in the end it doesn't matter much which weapon you use, because it will soon be too weak anyway and your only hope are the power-ups that replace your weapon.The Quests felt like good old Crimsonland (once I enabled perks in the menu) but the Survival mode is really inferior to the original one."

I played a hell out of it and I think it is safe to say that story only begins after the campaign has been finished. Survival is addicting as it only can be.Before you'll read the rest of the review please bare in mind, that I like this game, so don't get too negative image from upcoming sentences. It's just thera are some problems that will start bothering you after 15+ hours in the agme. If you don't intend to play that long, stop reading and just buy it, especially for local coop.Unfortunately game tends to be a bit annoying. After a while, I know which guns and perks will work and which will not. Since it is all random it may (and it repeatedly will!) screw you over. I'd like to explore more exotic guns and perks combinations, but the game simpli will not let me - because it is all random.In the end I was hoping for a little bit more - like a mode with a bit of control over gun drop, or mechanic (perk?) that would allow it. Also, I think there should be sandbox mode since a lot of perks are not well described and also a lot of stuff doesn't work together at all (e.g. rockets don't seem to apply the poison bullet effect).Overall, I think the game is great, but longevity is crippled by lack of improvements compared to the original game."

,Recommended,262830,32740811,Posted: 24 June,all,Reverberant Duck,"An absolute classic. Crimsonland was my first ""top-down action shooter"" of this sort. Super Contra/Super C are the earliest examples of this sort of play, and Serious Sam came out a few years before, which could reasonably be considered a relative, as well. But having the top down mode, waves of differing baddies, a huge variety of powerups and alternate weapons, and requiring very quick thinking and decisionmaking in a highly satisfying package was ALL Crimsonland's doing.There've been many successors since then. Alien Shooter by Sigma Team added a much more fully realized campaign, Shadowgrounds by Frozenbyte was the first finished game in this style presented in 3d. Even Valve got on the bandwagon with Alien Swarm, in a way.Crimsonland may not have been THE first to do everything it does, but it was definitely MY first. So certainly I have a bit of bias here, but I think it's well-earned bias, at the very least. The core of it is extremely simple and requires very little learning. Move, shoot monsters, grab powerups, don't die. The wide assortment of weapons, enemy types, and powerups means that you're constantly reevaluating everything you're doing as the situation changes, playing defensively at times, offensively at others, trying desperately to avoid picking up the dreaded blowtorch...It's a very satisfying package all around. Everything just feels good, it's proper fun. I recommend everybody interested in quick-thinking action check out Crimsonland. It's one of my favorites, and maybe it'll be one of yours too."

I've played countless hours off steam and this game is a must-have for the genre. The new UI is slick and ads cool features like an indicator around your cursor. The gameplay update is probably a good thing and not too different from the original but ultimately disappointing from a nostalgic perspective.

If you can still grab a saved game off the Internet and plug it into your copy, not only will you get to play the real Crimsonland but you all get all those mad cheevos.- The game itself has been slightly changed, so that enemies spawn outside the map, the game has you choose a perk on the spot rather than let you choose one at the time you want, no perks in the campaign... seemingly minor changes, but they affect the game in subtle ways. I don't mind it so much, but hardcore veterans might not like these changes.- No Typ'o' Shooter mode. Booooooooo.Despite all these flaws, I love this new iteration. This is the top-down murder simulator that's been rocking people's faces since its freeware and retail releases in the early 00's.

76561198035884174,Recommended,262830,31376773,Posted: 26 April,all,WarChaser,"Crimsonland; A cult classic, now better than everThe review turned out longer than I expected, so I will include a summary of my thoughts at the bottom.Like alot of people, I remember Crimsonland from back in the day. I first encountered it on a demo disk that came with a magazine I used to buy. With only the first chapter of the Quests mode being playable, I remember replaying it over and over again. Some years later, I discovered the Internet and what it had to offer, so I managed to obtain the full version of the game, finally being able to play through the entire thing. Rediscovering it again on Steam was quite a surprise, with a new look and a tempting price tag. However, having found out that perks are no longer present in the Quests mode, I decided against buying it.Forward a year later, and what do you know: Crimsonland is on sale, 80% off. Not only havere-added Perks into the Quests mode, but the game now comes with the classic version from 2003. It was a steal at the discounted price and I immediately bought it.A few weeks have passed since then and after playing through the game and going for some of the achievements, I'm happy to say that Crimsonland has not only retained everything that made it great (and a tiny bit frustrating at times), but has also managed to slightly improve upon it with a couple of new weapons, perks and game modes.The game has two main game modes, Quests and Survival, both with their own gameplay elements.Quests mode is separated into 6 chapters, each one having 10 levels. There is no story that follows these, but they're all thematically different from one another. They also have replay value as you unlock difficulty levels and achievements.You start each level with a pistol, and pick up different weapons and powerups as the level goes on. You can't however switch between weapons you've picked up, but are instead stuck with the last one you did. Kills earn you XP which can be used to select perks that can help you through the current level, as they reset at the end of each one. Beating a level will unlock a new Survival game mode, weapon or perk. Everything you unlock will then be present in Survival mode, as well as future Quests levels.Speaking of the Survival mode, it is devided into 6 other modes, each with its own set of rules. For example, Blitz is just like Survival, but sped up, with an increased number of monsters and powerups. Nukefism on the other hand has leveling and weapons disabled, allowing you to only use powerups if you want to survive.All  game modes provide a good challenge. The powerups and perks feel usefull and make a notable difference. Some weapons may seem underpowered, but each has its benefits in a specific situation. However, the randomess of it all, accompanied by some difficulty spikes may give the feeling that the game relies more on luck rather than on skill.Even though all of the game modes are playable co-op with up to three other players, and each survival mode having its own leaderboard, there is no online play.The sound and graphics present the game well, but are lacking in some departments.The game has a very clean look to it, so you'll be able to tell whats happening at any given time. Over a hundred monsters can be on the screen, with particles from your weapons, perks and powerups flying all over the place, the bits and blood of the monsters you killed clearly visible on the terrain for the remainder of the level. All this while the game manages to run smoothly all the way through.Although the graphical update of the new version boasts has plently of advantages, I feel as they didn't go as far as they could in some, and at the same time, could have toned it down in other places.The only purpose for the maps may be to provide a background for all the carnage to happen on, but they could have greatly benefited from a bit more detail, which would add to the atmosphere as well . Something I feel the classic version did better, as it had more robust visuals and a muter color palette .All of the weapons unfortunately still share the same model, something worth changing that carries over from the classic version. I also cosnider the look of menus in the classic version superior to those in this one, which look bland and generic, as if they were ripped straight out of a mobile game.You can take a look and see for yourself , as you get the classic version as well with your purchase.The soundtrack isn't that memorable for the most part, but some of the songs, like the menu theme and some of the level music, are badass to say the least. Thankfully, the soundtrack also comes separate from the game so you can listen to it at your leisure.In conclusion:Despite some slight missteps and wasted opportunities in remastering the visuals, Crimsonland retains its best qualities and adds onto them with new game modes, weapons and perks. It still looks and sounds good, while running and playing out with no issues. Some difficulty spikes and randomness in weapon drops and perk selection can make certain levels frustrating, but other than that the game is a blast to play and tempts you into getting all of the achievements. You can play co-op with up to 3 other people locally, as opposed to just 2 in the classic version.There are leaderboards for the Survival portion, but the games lacks online multiplayer.

This HD remake has everything I loved about the original Crimsonland and more.Yes, there are changes from the original version, but I feel that these were in good taste. One of the biggest changes I've noticed is that telekinesis no longer lets you selectively pick up powerups. Instead, it pulls all nearby powerups to you.Additionally, Typ'o'Shooter is nowhere to be found. This was one of my favorite modes and I REALLY hope that it gets brought back in an update.The gameplay is as insane as it was in 2003, if not moreso. There are so many enemies on the screen sometimes that it's hard to comprehend, and yet the game never skips a beat. The monsters now gib when you kill them, and this effect looks really great.Although online multiplayer would propel Crimsonland to new levels of awesomeness, the couch co-op is a ton of fun. I just tried it for the first time with a couple friends and we had a blast. The game scales the difficulty based on how many players there are, so be prepared for even more carnage.All in all, this is mostly the same game it was back in 2003 but with updated graphics and a few (good) tweaks here and there. As a player of the original Crimonsland, I highly recommend this game to fans and newcomers alike. Speaking of which; if you've never played Crimsonland, do youself a favor and buy this game right now."

Simplicity is a double edged sword, it can be a great element or a terrible one, it all depends on the execution.Crimsonland is  a twin-stick style top down shooter.  You spawn in a square map, enemies appear from all over and you must kill them all or die.  Simple as that.  There is more added in the form of unlockable weapons, “leveling”, power-ups/drops, and perks.  During each round you kill enemies, gain experience, level up, defeat all enemies, rinse and repeat.  Each time you level you can choose a perk.  Playing the “quest” missions steadily unlocks additional weapons and perks.  Both the weapons and perks are enjoyable and are a meaningful reward for the completion of a level.  There is enjoyment to be had from trying out each new weapon and perk.  Additionally during combat power ups will drop, these are things like temporary shields, health packs, temporary fire/damage boosts, speed boosts, etc. The perks do not carry over from level to level, which I kind of understand.  I think eventually if they did carry over you’d be far too OP.  The drawback is that it can be a bit jarring to go from a level where you’re powered up (and much faster than normal) to suddenly back to zero.  I died a few times on some levels readjusting.  It’s not a major problem by any means, and was the only real issue I have with the game.Although Crimsonland is ostensibly a generic and basic game, the extra touches in the form of tons of weapons and perks elevate this game above it’s generic base. I highly recommend Crimsonland. It’s a great deal of fun. I would however recommend waiting for a sale. Not to disrespect the devs (in saying they’re hard work isn’t worthwhile) but $13.99USD is far too high a price. Pop Crimsonland on your wishlist and wait until it’s $5USD or less. Crimsonland is great, and worth a purchase, just not at it’s normal asking price. Good luck, may all your games never crash. :D"

See also the comments.I really wanted to like this game. I played the original version in 2003 and loved it. Now 80% of the time I spend playing Crimsonland I am angry or frustrated or both.I don't know exactly what changed (aside fromt the obvious nerf to the Telekinesis-Perk). Maybe I as a player have a different approach to games now. Back then it might have been less important to me to finish a game 100% before playing something else.Now I mostly strife for completion or at least getting as close as I can. And in the case of Crimsonland that turned out to be  an incredible pain in the behind.So maybe it's due to my attitude and not to questionable gamedesign but my experience with this new iteration of Crimsonland was mostly unpleasant.What bugged me most was the random factor when it comes to your weaponry. In most levels and Survival runs you start with the pistol and one of the first 3 or 4 monsters you slay will drop another gun. This game has alot of weapons. Most of those are way underpowered. If they were better balanced or if I as a player had at least some kind of influence over which drops I see and which I won't see, that would make a huge difference. Restarting a level over and over again until finally one of those 5 or 6 viable weapons pop up is NOT fun. In most levels that is not necessary but trying to complete the harder ones with a suboptimal gun is just a waste of time.I have to say though, the carnage and frenzy of the original are still there. The soundtrack is awesome and if you get one of those (sadly) rare runs where everything falls into place and you get the right weapons, perks and drops in the right moment then it is indeed a wonderful experience. Full of bloody gore, splattered enemy-corpses and agonized screams."

In short, the game focuses more on the gameplay than the engaging story. To give a short summary of the game: begin level; kill monster for first weapon; kill more monsters for pickups such as more weapons and boosters; kill enough to level up and upgrade permanent perks; repeat process until level is completed (unless you play survival mode).This version is a bit different to the original. One of the differences being the installment of achievements which if I might add is really difficult to get at times, but I managed to do it. The playability in my opinion is very high as games don't usually last very long but is still fun enough in order to come back and improve on your last score.

Which is also the source of the ""reflex boosted"" powerup icon, if anyone didn't know =) I've bought this game a number of times on a number of platforms since then, and will happily buy it again if it comes out on some other thing I own! Where do I even start...Graphics - 3/5 No, they aren't spectacular compared to many...or any...of the AAA titles that have come out in the last few years. It is a top down, twin stick shooter, what are you really expecting here? Everything can be clearly and easily identified, and doesn't hurt to look at. Nothing spectacular, but then...I doubt that's what anyone was going for. Good enough really is good enough!Story - lol/wtf Once upon a time, there was a guy standing in the middle of a field for no reason. For no reason, aliens and spiders and beetles and zombies all started running at him. For equally no reason, all sorts of guns and powerups appear from the corpses of these things. Guy kills things until the reaper gets him. That's it, that's a summary of the story, narrative, and all the characters. What, were you expecting some Dickensian struggle? Some moral dilemma? Nope. Top down. Twin stick. Shooter. Kill things until you die. That's it, that's all there really needs to be for the genre.Sound - 4/5 Both at home and at work, for varying reasons, I play without sound usually. However, I do really like the soundtrack for Crimsonland! Best described with *slow heavy metal music plays*. It fits the rest of the game experience, without being too repetitive or irritating. My wife dislikes all the gunfire...sorry, can't be helped lol! The death sound is great for laughs tho!Controls - 5/5 It is, as stated, a top down twin stick shooter. The controls are intuitive and responsive, simple and complete, easy to change. I see no way this could have been better.Balance - 3/5 Good difficulty curve, except for any level involving spideroids. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those things.Gameplay - 5/5 Over the years, me and my employees have sunk literally thousands of combined hours into this game, between survival, and some of the hidden minigames. There is the right combination of luck and skill and planning involved to make different playthrus feel actually different and not repetitive. Hell, the monster spawns are more or less ""procedural"" and random in survival, maybe they can cash in on the ""roguelike"" tag that has become so abused and misused lately ;)Overall - 4/5 Balance in the campaign mode gets a bit rough in places, but overall, this is a very solid offering for the genre. Price is right. A great buy for any fan of the genre!"

This game was inspired by the, back then, famous game ""Phobia II"" in 1998, which in turn is very similar to the gameThreatin 1995 andSmash TVin 1990, but Crimsonland made this subgenre of frantic top down shooting popular and very well deserved so. Unfortunatly I forgot about it after 2007 and thought it would never see the light of day again. Until recently...So what is it all about? It's really simple to explain. You are aManly Space Marinewith the important mission to kill various types ofAliens,ZombiesandBugs. It sounds like childish fun on paper and thats exactly what it is. It's called Crimsonland because you basically paint the ground blood-red from pulverizing anything that shows up on screen. That basically sums up everything you need to know.GameplayThe core gameplay for this game is very simple. You control a soldier from a very retro-esque top down perspective via the WASD layout and aim and shoot monsters for score. Sometimes, monsters drop power-ups, which you can choose to pick up, or not as you need to conserve them while they're on the ground in order to get the fullest potential out of any of them. Having a strategy on how to progress properly is essential in this game so besides blasting Aliens it requires some forsight and mental preperation of things to come. Often your chances of survival your way to the power-up itself so you can pick it up isn't even big as the ever coming monster waves keep you occupied otherwise.Two of the basic main game modes are aQuest mode, which provides the Player with a set of ""Missions"" where the term only is used in the loosest of senses as the only thing you have to do in each mission is to kill a specific set of monsters until the bar of the upper side of the screen is filled out. It gets interesting however if you like to survive the round without taking a hit since the game at least acknowledges it so you can honor your skills with this game.Being good atCrimsonlandgets rewarded with a star and an achievement for survivng all normal missions and this game has some of the most difficult to get achievements I've seen yet, apart fromDustforce. As it requires a lot of partience to be rewarding, only the most hardcore of players may ever see one of the more difficult to get achievements. By completing missions you can unlock new Weapons, perks and Game Modes.The other mode is something that gets unlocked during the first few missions and that is theSurvival Mode. Survival mode is the Flesh and Bones of this entire game as this is the game mode where you can get level ups to attain the perks you previously unlocked in the Quest Mode. There is a very well structured On-Line Scoreboard so if you feel competitive you can always try to reach the Top 100.Graphics and SoundTo get straight to the point the graphics feel a little bit dated but I do believe that in this case it seem appropriate given the age of the game of it and how fluid the gameplay is. In terms of art direction I say that it all feels very pleasant to the eyes, as you can already tell from the pictures on the Steamstore for this game.In terms of sound effects this game feels a little bit lackluster and is the worst thing this game has to offer regarding everything elseCrimsonlandas to offer. Shooting your guns doesn't feel as strong as it should in my opinion and even launching a nuke doesn't feel as good as it should be. However I believe that the Music is pretty spot on given the gameplay as shooting up monsters and Metal seem to go hand in hand with carnage-themed games since Doom 1.VerdictI believe that this game is a fine example on how gameplay throughout the simplier ages of video game design(think about Smash TV or Robotron)can still be this refreshing. Sometimes you just want to shoot some monsters and rack up points with not much else. So if you believe that it's the game for you I hereby highly recommend that you should pick it up even if it isn't on a sale right now, as this is one of the genres finest.Recommended food while playingThe hottest Chili that you can find in order to fire yourself up for the madness that is this game."

Even the greenlight was gave the impression that the author wished to cop-out with this game with only the addition of local co-op.However, if the price drops for the holidays or you pick this up on a Humble Bundle, definitely pick it up, play through the boring quests as quickly as possible as the survival mode is still entertaining. Unfortunately though, the old classic game played fair better and was a lot more fun and ultimately I wish the author copped out completely and just reserved us the old title."
,Recommended,262830,13505279,"Posted: 21 December, 2014",all,sakuramboo,"The cult classic is back. This time with updated graphics, weapons, perks, and game modes.I was a huge fan of the original and was ecstatic to see it get rereleased on Linux.When it comes to top down shooters, Crimsonland is by far the best out there. Controls are very percise and mappable. The graphics update is beautiful when compared to the original and quite nice for being a 2D game. The interface also got a face lift. Orignially, your ammo count was an image on the top that showed you how many shots you had left. Now, it is a counter above the mouse. I prefer this seeing as I'm mostly looking at the mouse. In the original, any bonus you picked up would give you a count down in the upper left. Now, if the bonus affects your gun (firing rate, fire bullets, etc.) you get a yellow countdown around your mouse. If the bonus affects your character (shield) you get a clock like counter around your health bar (which is also now around the character instead of in the upper left hand corner). There are no countdowns for 2x, Freeze, or Speed bonuses. Some indication would be helpful, especially for the Speed bonus. But, I won't fault them too much on those. Lastly, the perk selector was overhauled as well. Originally, a window would pop up that listed the perks in a vertical list with a discription on the bottom. Now, they are images listed horizontally with the name under it when the mouse is hovered over it and the discription on the bottom and the biggest difference is that in the original you would hit Tab to open the perk selector. In the new version it appears automatically and you are forced to pick something to continue.Some of the weapons updates are nice but I feel that there are too many. While they are nice, since the weapon drops are completely at random you might never get the gun you really need for late game. Also, before the 1.9 patch of the original there was a trick to using the Pulse Gun and using the Angry Reloader perk that just made you dominate the map early on. This was ""fixed"" in 1.9 which was a huge let down in my opinion.I can't really say much about the perk other than telekenisis. This perk was changed heavily. Originally, you would hover your mouse over a bonus for a full second and you would pick it up. This made you have to be looking in its direction, which made it hard if you had enemies behind you. You basically had to stop shooting at them to pick up the bonus or time it so you could position them between you and the bonus to shot them. Now, the closest bonus will move towards you. I actually prefer this new method over the previous. Lets you focus more on the fight and less about trying to pick up the bonus. My only complaint is that I think the longer the bonus is traveling, the faster it should move. If you are running backwards, the bonus will never reach you because you can out run it. Still a better approach, though.They also added a new game mode. Nukefism gives you no weapons and only bonuses to pick up. Very hard game mode which is why the achievement is unlocked when you get 75,000 points in it. Unfortunately, they removed the Typ'o'Shooter game mode which was my favorite. An enemy would appear with a word over it and you would have to type it out to shoot at that enemy. Not only was that a great mode to teach typing but like all things Crimsonland would get progressively harder the longer you lasted. It really made you learn the layout of the keyboard. Typ'o'Shooter is greatly missed.With all of this being said, I feel that the price may be a little bit high considering that the original was only 10 dollars USD in 2004. By no means do I consider this a 14 dollar title, especially when they removed a great game mode and didn't really add anything of a story. When Survival mode will last, at best, 10 minutes before you get overwhelmed by enemies, these quick matches, I feel, makes the 14 dollar USD price tag a little bit much. However, on sale, this is a great buy.The biggest drawback to Crimsonland is that it relies a bit too rmuch on the random factor. I would have loved to see a game mode like Survival but where you can remove, say, 10 weapons and 15 perks from the pool. This would let someone get rid of some of the bad weapons and perks (like the Blowtorch... seriously, the Blowtorch? Why? I'd rather take the Pulse gun over the Blowtorch).Lastly, the Linux port was amazingly done. Performance was as expected. Some reports of reversed X axis on game pads which I believe are fixed as of this writing (or will be fixed soon). I did experience 1 random crash but I think that was caused by something else happening at the same time.If you are a fan of quick match top down shooters, storyless and senseless violence, or simple time killer games, I highly recommend this game. If you were a fan of the original, you might be left with a bad taste, but I wasn't."

I'm not talking about a very difficult level, I'm talking about a level that reaquires all the planets to be alinged in order for you to beat it. It's not SKILL hard, it's tedious and frustrating so much that after 500 attemps you are wondering ""what the hell am I doing here?"". It has the same thing in Survival Mode, basicaly impossible to get to level 7 (3, maybe 4 minutes of gameplay). You just can't, the amount of enemies and the lack of firepower will make it just mathematicaly impossible to go beyond level 6 unless, of course, the planets alling and you get the PERFECT combo of weapon/perks/powerups.Another aspect that goes beyond reason is the fact that ALL the monsters (zombies included) have the best targeting system in the world and could easily be integrated in the AA missile for jet fighters, let me explain: the monsters will not point AT you, they will point at your vector, meaning they will go where you WILL BE calculating your speed and their ones, therefor you'll be ALLWAYS surrounded by monsters. What's that? A wonderful life-saving powerup? Let's go get it... but you can't because all the monsters will create a BLOCKADE in front of you because of the aforementioned targeting system, even the zombies, the quintessential STUPID being can collimate with you like the best soldier with Direct Hit.Sorry but no, not worth the money, if it was free I would gladly suggest it to you worning you of the game killing problems... but PAYING for this?

Collect better weapons and power-ups they leave behind. Level up. Kill more of them with your bigger, shootier weapons until they overrun and kill you. Rinse. Repeat.Yes, there are quests, but they only exist to give you more stuff with which to kill monsters in the Survival modes.

These facilitate your blowing up of stuff in subsequent games. No story or dialogue at all, but this game really doesn't need any. Crimsonland is about the simple joy of holding down the left mouse button, emptying your Rocket Minigun's 16-round magazine in three-odd seconds, and watching critters explode like blood-and-meat-filled balloons."

Sadly, it is nothing more than a watered down version of the old game. Several key features that made the game great are now missing.- No perks in quest mode. This is HUGE! For some reason 10tons removed perks from main campaign mode. Which basically took all the fun out of the core gameplay.- No weapon switching. You are now only able to have one weapon at a time, which not only limits your fun, but also your ability to win.- No choosing when to take your next perk. There used to be a button for leveling up, which was very handy. It is now gone and instead the player simply levels up immediately via a pop-up menu. Not only does this detract from the overall strategy of the game, but it's also horribly disruptive. It will cause you to lose focus on the action, make mistakes, or even worse: accidentally pick the wrong perk. Because you have only one second to stop clicking before the perk menu pops up, you risk clicking on a random perk if you don't stop shooting.- No timer on powerups. It's a small thing, but again, it takes away from the subtle strategy of the game. There used to be a small timer for each individual powerup off to the side of the screen. That has been replaced with a generic circle icon surrounding the player character. You won't know how much time is left on any of your powerups except the most recent one.Without these features the game is, as one user said, butchered. It simply isn't as fun and doesn't contain the depth of strategy it used to. I'd recommend going online and finding a freeware version of the 2002 Crimsonland."

However there are some features in this new remake version which I have ...even despise.- First of all, why on earth it is not any longer possible to level-up and use perks in the quests!?- The Progress bar in the quests is pretty annoying. In my opinion it should be much smaller.- The new healthbar and reload system doesn't look very pretty although I understand the point behind it: the player doesn't need to take his eyes off of the player when there is alot of action.- In the survival, it is absolutely horrible when you can't no longer deside yourself when to pick a perk after leveling. There is usually very much action going on and therefore sudden pop-up windows can really ruin the game session.- I mainly play the game by myself, so the ""Press fire to join"" infos in each corner are very irritating.After all that complaining, there are also good new features.- It is nice how you must unlock the weapons and perks in the quests to be able to use them in the Survival.- The menus are more graphical, although somewhat crude-looking. (And some menus lack some buttons I'd presume to be there; like replay after winning a level)- Now it is possible to see each wepon's individual specs.- The star ranking in in each level (for beating it without taking a hit) adds playability a bit more. However I would like to have even more achieavables (stars) per level, like for instance >40% accuracy or complete the level under par time.- Four player co-op is nice! (hopefully in the future it will be possible over the net)All in all it is close to the good old legendary Crimsonland, but I don't completely agree with the new change choises the 10ton team has made.

I instantly bought this one when it was released, and while I liked it at first, I had to give it a thumb down after couple of dozens runs in Survival. My main issues with the game were:1) Low camera altitude: can't see the field of battle clearly2) New perk and experience system: no perks in quests (kinda), leveling up is extremely slow, some important perks altered for worse.3) Interface: power-ups are displayed on crosshair, hp and shield are displayed on player model.4) Survival Mode: added monster-spawners, average game longevity is ~3 times shorter than in original game, harder to get a weapon you want.After update 1.1.0, review was changed to positive, mostly because of the inclusion of original Crimslonland game for free. Changes to he game were good, but not good enough, since it didn't fix the main issue with survival mode: toned down exp gains in comparison to the old game, which resulted in very short survival matches, without any feel of buliding up your character.But now with update 1.2.3 I can totally recommend this one. Increased exp gains and some changes to perks made the game as enjoyable as the original. While in previous versions you died on level 6-7 (my personal highscore was around 350k points), now level 30 is not even impressive (50+ million points is pretty much a real thing). Of course, you're still pretty much screwed, unless you get at least few of the vital perks in first ten levels, but overall, now this game wrecks you with RNG (in terms of obtaining perks, weapons and power-ups) even less than the original did.Final thoughts:A great top-down shooter, with the potential to suck you in for dozens of hours, if you're into getting the high scores. The ""story"" mode (i.e. quests) is more of a training ground before survival, so I don't think it's worth to buy the game if you don't plan on playing survival. But if you do, prepare for absolute carnage, because Crimsonland is finally back.P.S. Took more than 2.5 years though."

I'm always looking for local multiplayer / co-op games that me and my friends can play together.  This one did NOT disappoint.  It reminds me of my younger days when I would play Smash TV at the local arcade (years later on the SNES...) and how much fun that game was.  This, simply put, is a great game to fire up and waste some time blowing through hordes of aliens, lizards, spiders, etc.  It has that constant 'just one more round' problem, which makes it nearly impossible for you to put the controller down.  (Many times I have to force myself to stop playing.)I haven't had a chance to play with any friends, yet, but just the solo mode has been a lot of fun.  Enough weapons and perks to keep things interesting and not being 'stale and repetitive' and when you think a level is to hard for you, you mange to get a good score of some decent weapons and power-ups to power through.  Not too hard, but not a simple cake walk either.  I've only done the quest mode so far, so I know there are more modes of fun to be had with with survival.Get this one when it is on sale.

One of them is, I'll admit, I've been playing it off and on since..around over 10 years ago?  I don't remember when it came out, but a buddy of mine showed it to me and we played it constantly.  So there's some nostalgia and attachment there for me.But I'm honestly surprised that, as old as it is at this point, it still has received updates in the past few years.Crimsonland is a top-down shooter, fast paced and at times brutal, but in a fun die-click-repeat-die again till you win kind of fashion.  It's one of those great time killer games, where maybe you want to play something cool, but don't have time to fire up something as cool as The Witcher 3 for example, and just need to get in a quick fix.There are several modes to choose from, plenty of weapons and perks to unlock, and for what it's worth, there are leaderboards, but I don't pay much attention to those personally.  The music is decent and fits the game, though I usually opt to put on something from my personal collection if I'm gonna go a few rounds, which suits me just fine.  Some modes I don't really care about, but to each their own.  Survival is by far my favorite.Give it a try.  It's worth the modest asking price.  It's cheap, fun, and addictive.

,Recommended,262830,32772470,Posted: 25 June,all,Jackdaw,"While I personally prefer this on my Xbox One, this is a classic. It sticks to the classic arcade feeling, and if you mainly play this for the survival mode as I do (Blitz on xbox, though I've not unlocked it here yet) it's a blast. The Quests to unlock all the stuff can certainly be challenging. Fast-paced, simple, and fun.Note that there is some RNG in this game. This mainly comes about in perk choices as you level up (think Dota, you level up every game from zero) but for the most part you get used to spawns and stuff. If you're one to aim for high scores, this helps that feeling.All in all this is one of those solid games I'd have to give a 9/10 for its presentation and what it is."

Back then I didn't trust online purchases but now it's on steam and this new version is great! I love it, my friends love it, and if you are a fan of top down arena shooters, you'll love it to.Contains dangerously satisfying levels of blood. Mmm yes."

Alone, I am beset on all sides...not by evil, as some claim, but by things that just view me as a food source...and they don't care about my well-being in the slightest. The comparison to how Americans treat each other is inevitable. Overall, I find Crimsonland to be highly cathartic. I use it for meditation; it assists in finding my Beta state in much the same way as the Lotus position helps yoga pratitioners. Play this game. It will change your life, forever, for the better."

This is a game which says ""here take this plasma cannon and slaughter hundreds of creatures."" It is a good game to pass time and have fun.I only have one question. Why didnt you put giant versions of the monsters as bosses?"

76561198005283699,Recommended,262830,30088003,Posted: 21 February,all,Bodhi's Pool Repair,"This is my all time favorite twin-stick shooter! I have played the original back in 2003 (which is included) as well as the re-release.There are several game modes, the main mode is called Quest Mode and it offers 3 difficulties. You are placed in the middle of the map while enemies are storming at you in waves and you have to defend yourself from a top down perspective. Weapons (shotguns, rocket launchers, plasma rifles and many more) and powerups (for example bullet time, fire bullets, shields) are randomly dropped by dead enemies. While you shoot your opponents you will gain experience points and level up. Those levels offer special perks you can pick and they range from faster reload times to poison bullets. Each stage in Quest Mode has a distinct layout and starting weapon and by completing them you unlock new perks and weapons. The more you progress the more difficult the stages become.Of course there is a Survival Mode, where you have to survive as long as you can as waves of enemies come after you. It features all perks and weapons that have been unlocked in Quest Mode. Or you try the Typ’o’Shooter or Rush mode. The game also offers local multiplayer of two players on the original and up to 4 on the re-release.Crimsonland's Quest Mode and multiple side modes offer enough content to have you entertained for hours. Each round feels different, depending on the perks you pick and the random weapon drops. I tend to play the game in short bursts, you can easily drop in and out. It controls fine with both mouse and keyboard or gamepad. Tech-wise Crimsonland only shows age in terms of graphic options, the overall look and mechanics have aged well.The price tag is a bit high, but it's not spectacular overpriced. If you like action games with light RPG mechanics, give this one a go!"
