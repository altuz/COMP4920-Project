I played the first chapter and enjoyed it enough to rebuy it here on steam along with fully supporting the release of chapter two. If you enjoy the genre in the slightest then get this. These devs deserve the support. Can't wait for the third chapter!Atmosphere -Monkey Island meets Grim Fandango in a dark, wet and jazzy neon lit world.Sound -The voice acting is decent, but entertaining and the soundtrack is a moody masterpiece.Gameplay -Familiar point and click mechanics with simple, but logical puzzles.Story -Light, but original with enjoyable characters on par with those that inhabited the early Lucasarts adventures."

The characters are just as charismatic as in Chapter 1 and the dialogue / story-line have an even greater sense of humour.Additionally, this game's VOICE actors are talented - which makes the game much more immersive.  They did an incredible job for you to relate to the characters even though they are quite simplistic visually; in a sense that their faces are all based on ""African"" or ""Caribbean"" wooden face masks but which were carefully chosen by design to portray their basic personality traits.Needless to say, graphically, it's well-done. A mix of simple and complex imagery. The cut-scenes are breathtaking.  The feel of the art-style is quite fitting with the entire story / mood.The puzzles increase in difficulty as the game progresses... I got stuck maybe 2-3 times for a while but it was never frustrating -  I persevered until I figured it out.  Very much satisfying! :)In summary:  Underrated humorous point & click adventure.  I recommend that you play Chapter 1 if interested, as there is a progression to the story (**even though I noticed that they made sure via the dialogues that you would not feel lost if you hadn't played Chapter 1, so maybe not necessary?**).  The length of the game was satisfying as well, considering it took me so long to figure out the last puzzle.  Ya' mon! :)I'm looking forward to Chapter 3!"

I guess, I'm just happy that the puzzles are pretty straightforward and there's no need to pull some unobvious shenanigans; just focus on the story and enjoy the game.What I really love about TJD2 is the setting. The evening, the rain, the bright lights of the city, – the whole noir atmosphere in addition to the smooth jazz soundtracks; it's just brilliant. It's all worth just pausing the gameplay and leaning back for a while, staring at the art and listening to the music, so good it is.Highly recommend for playing, but be careful, you may occasionally fing yourself willing to pour a glass of whiskey and smoke a cigar, even though you don't smoke or drink."

I was a big fan of the first chapter. Overall, I really liked the game and if you have played the first chapter and liked it, you should like this one too. If you haven't played the first chapter but like or are interested in old-school point and click games, I recommend buying Chapter 1.However I was rather disappointed with the production quality because it felt worse compared to the first chapter. If the developers happen to be reading this, please take this as constructive criticism: Few of the environments felt like they were taken straight out of the concept artist, meaning they felt like they were missing finishing touch. I found that 3D objects often didn't blend didn't blend well with the 3D objects.The resolution of the assets appeared pretty low, then again I am using 2560x1440 monitor but that doesn't excuse them from creating the high quality assets to begin with.Sound quality varied and some were straight out bad (not the voice acting quality but the equipment used were bad). Voice volumes with from one sentence to another sometimes varied which kind of ruins the atmosphere. The music however was good, pretty much what I expected considering Chapter 1.Puzzles were most of the time pretty easy, the only puzzle that gave me a headache was where you had to guess the right code for a certain door. I still don't understand completely how the green, yellow and red lights were supposed to work.Otherwise it was a great game and I'll be definitely buying Chapter 3 on day one.Also R.I.P. Simon D'souza. :("

Music is well produced, and the presentation is alright. Graphics are alright, though animation is quite poor (the lower budget coming through).All of that is forgiveable, but, unfortunately, I never found myself caring much for the story itself. There were not really any attempts at humor either. So all that's left are the puzzle, which you will finish in 2-3 hours, without much challenge. Most puzzles seem to be locked behind an arbitrary event, forcing you to figure out the order of puzzles by trial and error."

There are more set pieces, with even better subtle animation highlights, more cutscenes and the cast has grown. The on point writing with super cheesy jokes remains top notch and this time around the puzzles involve a lot less backtracking. The price is still a slight bit of contention, about 3 hours of content for $11. SkyGoblin was smart however and both Chapters 1&2 can be had for $15 which seems a lot more reasonable a price for what you get in both games combined. I think that if they continue to be smart they will bundle the upcoming third chapter with the first two for an even $20 and it will be a perfect package."

Beautiful scenery, logical, not too convoluted puzzles, delightful characters, and even better music than the first game. Sky Goblin have even remedied one of my complaints about the first chapter, and made it so a double click on an exit will get you to the next screen immediately.This chapter is much longer than the first chapter, but I still played through it in one sitting (four hours). The game being so new, there are no walkthroughs on the net yet, but even though I was a wondering what to do at one point (I hadn't noticed that a new exit had opened up in an old location), I never got really stuck.Some professional reviewers on the net have called these games spiritual successors to  Grim Fandango, and the old Lucas Arts adventure games, some have even called them virtual copies. I can go along with the first, but never the second: The Journey Down has too much style and personality for that. It is a unique, charming, and fun game, well worth the price of admission.My only complaint is that now I have to wait God knows how long for the third chapter."

The voice acting is high quality, the ambience is charming, the characters are funny and the plot engaging. Most of the puzzles are easy, which is good if you are looking for some relaxing casual gaming, but you might not like it if you are an hardcore gamer.

The puzzles are improved (my biggest gripe with the first) the story is short, sharp and fantastic and overall I got a solid 3.5 to 4 hours out of it by doing everything and talking to everyone. Worth the asking price. One bugbear is that on my headset the audio was quiet on the left channel all game when the characters were talking, and there's one puzzle near the end that was a little pixel perfect and even though I had the thing where I needed it, it still wouldn't register. Overall though a great game."

The puzzles were better this time around and weren't any overly easy puzzles like in the first chapter and there are many memorible charecters in this one Ride Reynolds immediately comes to mind. The overall story is pretty good by itself but there are a few plot points that you'd need to play chapter 1 to get.

,Recommended,262850,24320501,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,Fox3,"I'll review chapter 1 & 2 together, as if they were one single game since their mechanics are exactly the same and the chapter two continues the story from the point where the first chapter ends. Also their play times are very short individually. Even though i like to explore every detail in such games, it took me about 7.5 hours in total to complete both chapters.TL;DR: Get it if you like pointing, clicking, humor, a bit noir style, a bit mystery, the good old jazz and Bob Marley. :)ReviewThe Journey Down is a very nice point & click style adventure game with humor that i would recommend to anybody who likes the genre. If you decide to buy, get the both chapters together. The game doesn't have tedious parts like some members of this genre does. You don't have to watch your character walk for ages, it skips to the place if you double click.StoryThe story is not the most amazing one i've seen in a point & click style game but it's decent enough. It has some mystery elements and can make you curious at some points. In short, not amazing but good enough to keep you playing.PuzzlesMost of the time the puzzles are pretty easy. You usually know what you need to do when you first see an item ,if not, you can figure out quickly. The game is rather relaxing than pushing you hard to solve a puzzle.CharactersThe characters are cool and their accents are really fun. Their heads are inspired by african tribal masks. You play as a young guy named Bwana. There are two other main characters named Kito and Lina. I liked all of the characters in the game especially our guy Bwana.Art and AtmosphereThe art design is very charming. The game has a nice carribean and also noir atmosphere. The hand drawn places look wonderful.SoundtracksOne of the best things about the game ,besides its art design, is it's soundtracks. It includes some reggae and jazz tunes and the soundtracks become more jazzy in second chapter. The music fits well with the atmosphere of the game.ProsCharming atmosphereLikeable charactersBeautiful art designAwesome soundtracksGood enough storyFun accentsCharacter animations are not tediousGives you access to some nice behind the scene content when you finish a chapterConsShort play timePlaces are somehow limited, not many different placesPuzzles are too easy sometimes, they don't require much thinkingSometimes it feels like things are happening faster and easier than it should (or is it just me?)"

,Recommended,262850,22886382,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,Cytokrom_C,"This game has a nice, unique graphical style with likable characters and a good soundtrack.However there are a few key components of a point-and-click game where the game unfortunately falls short:1. Storyline:The story-line is very linear. A P&C game has to be linear to some degree by necessity, and I have no problem with this, but this is taken to the extreme here. Commonly you have some degree of choice in which order you want to accomplish certain tasks, e.g. some tasks that require completions of several puzzles could be done in your order of choice. In this game the path is set and it is pretty clear what is required as the next step at every moment decreasing the illusion of having an influence on the storyline...Also, it feels like there is a lot of the story that was lost on the way, like the release was somewhat rushed before the game was finished. E.g. there is a map that you find early in the game indicating many places that are not available in the game. The game design with the taxi makes me think there were bigger plans from start...2. Difficulty/challenge:I guess this is the most difficult aspect to get right with a P&C game. If puzzles are too hard you get stuck all the time, feel stupid, and the gameplay is not very enjoyable. If too easy, the game feels less meaningful and you do not get the nice feeling of accomplishment. This game was on the ""too easy"" part of the scale. Puzzles were very easy and combined with the linerar storyline, there was no point in the game where I had to stop and think. On the plus-side, although not very challenging, puzzles were generally logical and did not rely on pixel hunting...3. Length:Perhaps as a product of the two points above, the game felt very short. Being decently affordable and presented as an episode of a game rather tha a full game, perhaps this is to be expected. I guess that the unfinished feeling of lost intrigue/parts of the game, emphasize this feeling even more though...Verdict:Despite its shortcomings, the game has a certain charm to it and it was generally enjoyable. I will likely pick up part 3 when available. Although there are many other P&C games I would recommend before this one, there are also many that are worse..."

,Recommended,262850,12002865,"Posted: 6 September, 2014",all,d i s d a i n [1 3 8],"If you are a fan of Grim Fandango, this is a LOT better than Broken Age (and I did enjoy broken age).Originally seeing the trailers for chapter 1 I thought ""this looks a bit like grim fandango, but a little rough around the edges"" so I wasn't convinced. Since Chapter 2 came out and the first one was on sale I bought it and it is worth it. The storytelling is great, shot-not-tell, and the atmosphere smacks of Fadango, but is certainly a unique tale of its own. Each character has a distinct personality. Imagine if there was only one jazz album ever, anyone who tried to emulate it could be accused of ""copying,"" but suffice to say this is expanding the genre in a fun way and GODDAMNIT THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THIS.Soundtrack is also top tier, contributes a great deal of the atmosphere.Overall the game is pretty simple, you don't get stuck, but if broken age is 1/10 difficulty and the original discworld is 9/10, then this is about 3/10 in terms of difficulty, but really it is more about the dialouge and atmosphere.If you are looking for a story-driven adventure game and questioning whether this is worth it: It is."

The voice acting is marvelous and you can really see all the love that went into the design of the game and the painting of the backgrounds and the animation of the characters. Also of note are the beautifully rendered fim sequences, snippets of which can be seen in the trailers.The music is again marvelous and the more big bandish feeling than the first installment really enhances the atmosphere.The game took me about 5 hours in total to finish but it were fun hours none the less - and this is what matters. The puzzels are not super complicated but fun with cool jokes strewn in between. The story has gotten even better than the first part. I liked the really moving behind the scenes part that you unlock after finishing the game.I can definately recommend this game to everyone who loves adventure games, even at full price (which is not that high to boot with).The 1.5 years until I could play this game were a long time, but seeing how it turned out I must say that they were very well spent by the team. I am looking forward to the next installment and, although I would like it best to be available right now, I must say: take your time so that I can again play such a marvelous game in the near future.

,Recommended,262850,23075964,"Posted: 18 May, 2016",all,ElusiveOne,"The Journey Down: Chapter Twopicks up exactly where the first installment left off, and it expects you to have fully played it as it wastes no time with lengthy re-introductions, save for a quick recap conversation with your trusted friend Kito.For its intermediate chapter, the series traded its positively laid-back vibe for a resolutely noir ambiance. This is in part due to the nature of Port Artue, the game's main location, set in the confines of a dark mist. Consequently, pitch black darkness and haze envelops most scenes' skylines instead of the warm hues of dusk, city lights and waterfront of the first game.The visuals look great as a general rule, though some of the art panels are manifestly sketchier. It is never too distracting but it feels lightly inconsistent with the other fully realized backgrounds. Many scenes feel monochromatic, whereas the first game was resolutely more lively. The music is also somewhat less festive but just as effective most of the time.Regardless of the change in tone, the game hasn't really lost much of its charm. Its characters and situations are truly enjoyable. The first half of the game features less of the cinematic moments and animated transitions. Whereas Chapter One felt more immediate, Chapter Two takes some time to build up into a genuinely fun experience. It picks up tremendous momentum about halfway through, and ultimately reaches the simple greatness of its shorter debut episode.Bwana remains one of the most original and charismatic characters I've played in point-and-click adventure games. While a lot of his success resides on pure luck, he's delightedly never portrayed as an idiot or incompetent. Puzzles are generally fairly obvious and pleasant to solve, focusing more on the story than on challenging enigmas.The story unmistakably sets the stage for the third and final chapter but is still satisfyingly conclusive on its own. Chapter Two is nearly twice as long as Chapter One. If you have any interest in this game, and you should, you owe it to yourself to start with the first episode, for which I also wrote ashort but glowing review.Chapter Three can't come soon enough!"

It's the tiki bar of adventure games.It manages to be nostalgic without blatant references, to be zany without being stupid or infuriating, and generally manages to avoid most of the pitfalls of its genre. Most of the time the puzzles flow effortlessly, and you only rarely experience the sort of dissonance between story and puzzles that came to be the killing flaw of the adventure genre.Overall, this is one of the big new titles, right up next to neo-classics like Wadjet Eye's Resonance, Primordia and Blackwell, or the Telltales Monkey Island revival series. I'm not mentioning Daedalic, because Daedalic should pay these guys to give them lessons in game design and story writing.Big, big A+.

Every fan of adventure games knows that their overall quality has gone down quite a bit in the recent years, and it is very hard for the modern iterations to live up to the standards set by the old guard. However, while I was playing this game, I felt as if I was transported back to the 1990s. The production quality is superb, the soundtrack kicks♥♥♥♥♥and the noir atmosphere is amazing and creates the atmosphere of a 1950s noir film.Most of the puzzles are sensible and not that difficult, although some of them can be solved out of order (ahead of time), which makes you wonder ""What am I supposed to do with this item?"", until you find a use for it later. Only the last one gave me a real headache and made me resort to a walkthrough, but given the overall quality of the game, all is forgiven.TLDR: if you liked Monkey Island and Grim Fandango, do yourself a favor and get this game."

The plot develops well, the music and artwork is even more incredible, and you get introduced to many new people and places. There were a couple of times where I acquired items or seemed to have a task to obtain an item without clearly knowing the reason for it. This isn't uncommon in PAC games and perhaps it's because I talked to people out of order, but I found this detracted a bit from the story. The other thing I found was that Bwana's voice was consistently quieter than everyone else's, and I had to adjust my volume a bit to avoid other characters sounding like they were shouting - just a sound-mixing issue.Looking forward to Chapter 3!"

There is a very brief re-cap at the start of the game should you want to either skip Chapter One or if it's been a while since you played it.I played the game on Linux Mint 17.3 and it worked flawlessly so well done on the developers for that.I'm proud to say that this is one of the few point and click adventure games I've completed in my life without ANY reference to a walkthrough. I don't think this is because the game is too easy, I think it's because the game is very well designed without any ""Put the octupus in the toilet to get the gold belt"" puzzles. It does help that the game isn't too sprawling so you're not wandering around aimlessly trying to find what you need/where to go.The music in the game is outstanding and really helps create a fantastic atmosphere and the character designs are just great. The designers have crafted a particular style and it really works for them. I've even snapped a few screenshots to use as a desktop background for a while.The voice acting and script is top-notch too. I want to continue playing the series because I want to spend more time with these characters and in their world.Now I just need to wait for Chapter 3. I'm very much looking forward to it."
