,Not Recommended,262900,20385025,"Posted: 7 January, 2016",all,ZeroOne,"At the moment I'm some 5.5 hours into the game. Turns out it's not really a ""simulation"" nor a ""strategy"" game (as implied by the Steam tags) but a ""click-and-wait"" game. Luckily I got it at a decent discount.The premise is promising and could make for a very interesting game. Thus it's a real shame it's almost not a game at all. Your business runs on its own and you just have to keep adding new rooms and people when you have the money -- and usually you don't have the money, so most of your time is spent waiting for money to accumulate. There's also not much to stop the money from accumulating, except for the random message dialogs that randomly pop up and require you to click ""OK"". The game is literally unable to advance a single in-game day without you being present clicking something. Forget about SimCity and the like where you could leave the game to run for an hour and come back. This game runs a minute or two and after that it need you to click a button.Building a new room into your call center costs $3000 or more. At least in the beginning (for the first couple of hours) you won't make more than a few hundred dollars a day, so you wait. And wait. And wait. Occasionally someone quits and you need to replace him or her, and that of course takes away from the small pile of money you had accumulated.Upgrading rooms costs $5000 or more, so your money seems much more well spent just adding rooms than upgrading them. Or at least I think so. The game lacks proper statistics so it's difficult to get an overview of your situation. Sure, you can read the thoughts of all of your employees and you can see a list of your clients (up to a whopping number of two (2) within my first 5.5 hours, or two in-game months), and you can click on all of your rooms and get to know some stats about them. But there's no list of rooms, or heat maps of any kind. There is a list of employees, but it appears that you cannot sort it, and the filter system (for choosing which types of employees you want to see) is really clumsy, requiring multiple clicks on a different screen from the actual list! So while you can get the details of a detail, there's no real big picture available.Talking about your employees, you can hire different kind of people: inbound (IB) agents to receive calls, outbound (OB) agents to make calls, managers, janitors, etc. The different professions are very stereotypical. They might've been true in the 1960s or funny in the 1990s, but seriously, it's 2016 now. When a manager's work description is ""putting fear in the agents"" and you see him running around and shouting at people, I don't even. Similarly, a ""Coach"" turned out to be a cheerleader girl waving pom-poms. Seriously??You can also educate your employees (just a click of a button and ta-dah, they are instantly smarter!). The education levels are very sketchy too, like a manager learning a class ""Management By Fear"" or another person learning ""Lying 101"".Yet another profession is the Project Manager. They unlock new things for you to do. However, you cannot decide what, so most of the time they unlock the possibility of building an even taller building (10 floors, 15 floors, ..., 50 floors, ...) when your building is still less than 5 floors tall and you'd much rather have, say, some better education levels or some new room types. (Not that it'd matter, you wouldn't have the money to buy those things anyway, until after waiting for quite some time.)All in all this game seems to waste its potential really badly. It's not a game that you play intensively, but a game that you put into the background or on your second screen while facebooking or something, and just check out occasionally to click ""OK"" on that dialog. I believe I'll still give this game a chance for a couple of more hours to see if the money would start pouring in a little faster and if that would make it funnier, but I have my doubts."

I've had a lot of fun experimenting with different layouts and mixes of employees. If you like tower builders or business simulators, it's a fun light hearted game that will keep you challenged the whole way through. How high can you build before the nearly unescapable death spiral brings you crashing back down? Easy to pause and save at pretty much any point in the game, which is great for someone like myself who usually plays turn based strategy games or slower city building games.Computer techs kicking computers until they start working again is quite possibly the best example of IT work I've ever seen in a video game. Watching managers storm around freaking out for no reason will make any call center, retail, or food service worker feel right at home.This is one of those ones you buy that make you angry you spent $60 on some AAA title you got bored of in 20 minutes."

For those familiar with Sim Tower, this game is not too dissimilar. Like Sim Tower, you have to ensure your elevators are working at their best to ensure your staff move around quickly. You also have to provide service staff to fix all your computer issues and provide general maintenance.This game isn't a cakewalk, however, as balancing your funds and prioritising is paramount. You will not always be able to achieve what you'd like, and there is always something that is requiring of your attention (and money). The pixel art is great and overall looks polished.  I would, however, like to see the speed capability increased, as oftentimes I am just waiting around for the next day.Overall, I think this is a great casual game."

Both tracks of the soundtrack aren't obnoxious either, even after 40 hours.There is enough room for improvement left in this game that I would consider getting a sequel or expansion if one were released.  It'd be nice to have some metrics screens to help identify poorly performing employees, to be able to adjust schedules of several employees at once, to be able to see the previous day's performance again after you've closed the screen that comes up at midnight, and some way to more easily tell what hours you are over/under-staffed (especially with L2s!).There seem to be odd algorithm issues that could be improved, such as when you have multiple flowtubes and employees sometimes take unnecessarily long routes or when your elevators are upgraded and people get stuck on them quite awhile because of how the floor stops get queued.  Still, if you're a fan of casual tycoon/sim games, none of these are serious enough to ruin the game.The biggest obstacle I ran into was IT staff quitting frequently because of the poor performance of the elevators (I finally caved and built them their own elevator at the end of the IT wing of the building)."

The problems I find is that:1) every time you earn an achievement, it pauses your game and forces you to click ""ok"" which gets annoying when you are earning achievements every minute or so, and especially when you're in the middle of doing something2) every time you want to build something, you have to go through the menu system again (you cant click what you want to build once, then build 5 of them)3) It gives  you little ""side problems"" such as people stealing from your company, where you have to click on each person to find out if it is them. When you have 20 employees thats easy, but when you have 50 or more then it gets very slow and tedious.Aside from these issues, the game itself could be quite fun.

I mean simple in the way that the concept is straight forward, there seems to be a lot of depth to the mechanics of it.  Looks a little dated on the looks and controls, but not a serious downside. A few processes, like purchasing new employees, are a bit harder than I feel they should be. In the example hiring a Call Center Rep involves opening the store menu, opening the operations staff menu, selecting the type of rep, and dropping the rep on their workspace. Not terrible, but pretty taxing when you just added 12 desks and need to fill them all. The tutorial feels a little invasive and it seems to play every time.Breaking it down to Pros and Cons.Pros:Easy initial learning curve.Decent depth in mechanics beyond initial learning curve.Cute art stlyleUnique GameLow PriceCons:Dated feel.Tutorial nevers.No true ""Sandbox"" mode.Occasionally frustrating processes.A good value.

I read in a guide that you had to put down one elevator per building segment, which is unrealistic and utterly lame. You get limited real estate after all on the horizontal. You can apparently add more elevator cars, but you have to wait for a project manager to unlock it after days of waiting. The wait kills me.- It makes sense that computers break down, but they seem to do so way too much. This is unbalanced and frustrating.- Workers quit way too often. Is call center turnover this bad in real life? Jesus.- Seems like way too much grinding.- You can't cancel contracts. Why is this bad? When you don't do enough of the tasks per day, you get penalized $100 per Inbound, Outbound, or Backoffice category. It's frustrating when turnover is so high and it's hard to get enough productivity out of your shifting work force. It doesn't help computers break all. the. damn. time!- It costs a down payment to recruit personnel.

A great combination between Corperation Inc. And sim tower, This game combines great aspects from both.  How ever, there are quite a few reasons this game isn't a thumbs up.1.Unlocking is slow.What I mean is, by the time I was given the ability to purchase handymen/HR people/Project managers, it was either after the time I realized I needed them(in the case of HR/Project Mnagers) or when the cause that i needed them escalated way out of hand.2.No hot keysIf I wanted to change the shift time of a group of employees, I had to select each worker, open the menu, slide the thing, save it and close it for each worker.  While this isnt as big of a problem concerning one or two blocks, this becomes a tiresome chore when dealing with entire clients.  I would also put hotkeys/mass selection. in for hiring/firing, educating, and upgrading3. No control of unlocksThe project manager researches what ever he wants, taking a couple of in game days.  I would suggest having a more a concrete progress bar instead of ""about 3 days.""  I would also suggest allowing me to select which things im reserching.

Or you can laugh at the ridiculous reasons your workers give for not coming to work today.Basically you are running a call center and you continously expand and upgrade it. You get a new workload everyday and try to deal with it. You pay your workers and increase your capital which you use to improve your building and the life standards of your workers.

I've been able to do this with so many other games, but not this one.

When it was cheap in a sale, I grabbed it.As a business sim, it's rather lacking. The economy is very predictable and very easily exploited to make money a waiting game rather than a commodity. If you make sure you have a few thousand to pay your employees at the start of each day, you never need worry again. Set up a situation where you're earning more than you're spending and leave it running for a few ingame days to let the income pool.Or at least you could do that, if the game didn't pause every few minutes to tell you that one of your hundreds of employees isn't feeling well. Thanks, but that's what the HR Report's for. Between pauses for sickness, deal changes and end of day reports, the flow of the game jitters too much to easily farm money. Granted most if not all of these pauses auto-continue on their own, but for those 30 seconds or however long, your entire business is paused. When 5 people go sick in one day, that's a lot of wasted time.Then there's the worst aspect of the game; theft.There's a chance that one or more of your employees - especially in the late game - can start stealing from you. One or more times an ingame day, you'll get a pop up saying that x amount of money has been stolen and that you should find the thief. This x can be as low as $100, but I've seen it as high as $5000. Of course by that point I earned five times that a day, but the pop ups were annoying.The way you find the thief is to read the thoughts of your employees (that's a mechanic, Rollercoaster Tycoon-style) to find the one who thinks ""they won't notice it missing"". This can be any one of your hundreds and there's no way to sort by thought (unlike RT). You have to go one by one or wait until their theft obviously impacts their lifetime earnings.I eventually worked out quicker ways, but it's a drag. You catch one and there are two new ones the next day.Menu-heavy games usually allow the keyboard to move and select. In this one, however, you have to click everything. Sick employee, click the OK. New day, click the OK. Another bloody thief, click the OK. It's bloated, unwieldy and quickly becomes a drag. I only have so many hours in it because I had it on in the background when I was doing other things. And even that's just so I could satisfy my 100% achievement compulsion.Now that I have, I immediately uninstalled it and will probably never go back to it.Kinda funny in places (company names and some descriptions can be a good laugh the first time), but the mechanics need fine-tuning, the economy balancing and the menus un-terribling. Nilesy made it look kinda fun, though."

The art is aesthetically pleasing and contains a good bit of detail. Trash will build up throughout the day, cracks will appear as the buildings deteriorate, and the objects in rooms change when rooms are upgraded. The graphics are also clear and easy to understand with each room and employee color-coded and easy to distinguish.GameplayThe gameplay consists of building new rooms and facilities for your employees, managing the hiring and firing of your employees, assigning job tasks, researching new upgrades, and acquiring new contracts for your company. The room building is done on a grid system and the game encourages you to build up (as in Sim Tower, for easy comparison). One aspect of the game that was rather grating for me is that there is no way to mass select your employees. Moving an employee to a different desk is a chore. For someone like me that likes things to be organized, shifting my workforce around to ensure that like employees were in the appropriate room involves selecting the first employee, issuing a move command, selecting a separate empty desk, selecting the second employee, issuing another move command, moving them to the correct vacant desk, and then doing the same to get the first employee to the appropriate desk. Also, at the end of each day, you are presented a summary report of the day's activity that will kick you out of any menu you have open at midnight each day.SoundThe sound design is very minimal in the game. You have a few looped chiptune-esque songs in the background that is mostly covered by the sounds of phones ringing, elevators going up and down floors, and your IT staff ""repairing"" computers.Closing ThoughtsThis game is competently made and performs its functions without hiccup, however, the game is just not fun, in my opinion. The tech tree is incredibly shallow and the game offers no greater strategic depth other than finding out an optimal room structure and then hiring enough workers to cover the amount of work your have to do for your contracts. I found myself playing the game with the speed slider turned all the way up and the game still felt like a slog. The problem is that the progression in the game is too slow. Perhaps this is to compensate for the lack of depth, but I spent more time waiting for money to roll in so I could build a new room (which I couldn't actually afford employees for then) than I did actually doing any meaningful tasks in the game. Business simulations like Rollercoaster Tycoon, Theme Hospital, etc. have better pacing so that you're never sitting around for days in game waiting for enough funds to come in. Maybe this is a symptom of the game being ported/targeted for mobile platforms.

I'll leave these notes just in case the developers want to patch this or perhaps make a sequel.1. Lack of micro controls. I constantly found myself in a situation where I wanted to change ALL my Outbound agents or all my Back Office agents to a different client, and then had to go around changing that setting for *each and every office*, which as you can imagine got very boring very fast. This game would seriously benefit from the ability to set control groups of office blocks so you can change settings for whole groups of office blocks en masse.2. The menu sidebar. As a result of the constant client-switching mentioned above, another thing that often annoyed me was the inaccessibility of the performance report (the one that tells you how many jobs have been done and how many are left for each client). One would think that such an important menu would be included on the sidebar (which includes the HR menu, one that I hardly ever have to look at), but it wasn't: instead I'd have to go into the pause menu to find it. Not a huge problem admittedly, but it would nonetheless be very convenient to have the option of choosing which menus you want in your sidebar for quick and easy reference.3. Game balance. This point should be taken with a grain of salt since I'll admit I didn't play the game more than a couple of times, but it really seemed to me as though the only way to make a profit was to focus solely on the Outbound and Back Office work and just take the hit on the Inbound penalty. With the small profits you make at the beginning you simply don't have enough money to spend on the huge amount of Inbound agents that you need to fulfil a contract, especially factoring in other costs like the employee benefit blocks (the restroom, restaurant etc.), service blocks and agents, and of course the elevator. You can play it safe and save up but that takes a lot of time not doing anything which simply isn't fun, not to mention if you don't hire Account Managers the number of jobs you get will start to go *down*, which means less money - on the other hand, every day you have an Account Manager hired is another day closer to having another client contract forced on you, so you get stuck in the double-bind of not getting enough money but also not being able to fulfil your contracts, thus incurring penalties which makes it even harder to make a profit. Either the game should give you fewer Inbound jobs or make a few costs cheaper to subsidise the building and staffing of Inbound offices.4. Priority System for Coaches. I noticed that moods were getting low in my offices so I invested in some Coaches. However, the Coaches didn't seem to have much of an effect because they randomly targeted people - a lot of the time they would go and cheer up someone whose mood was already high, which is simply a waste of time, effort and money. As a result, those with low moods ended up quitting (rather unreasonably I thought, especially after I'd bought all the employee benefit blocks for them), forcing me to hire new staff. On a particularly bad day the new hires not only wiped out my profits but also bit into my savings, making it even more difficult for me to expand. Surely Coaches should prioritise workers with low moods to stop this from happening?"

The only major gripes i have is that it has a bit more boring micro managing than i like, having to upgrade each employee/room by hand after getting them with no option to buy them at the upper levels that have been unlocked. Doing so for 36 people and 9 rooms gets a bit tiring. Also, the difficulty of manuvering around the building without a minimap of some kind to get around quicker. Even the ability to save camera positions would be nice. Other than that its a decent game. Thou without more to do, once i finish my 100 days on my current game, i dont see myself returning for another playthrough anytime soon. Not bad for the price, cheaper than a movie ticket, and a few more hours of entertainment than one."

Unfortuantely, the game isn't very enjoyable though. Too many buildings and staff are locked at the beginning of the game, and you kinda need them beforehand. Also it took me 9 in-game days just to be able to get HR staff, 9! You cant change schedules of your employees or anything until day 9, then you have to have the money to build the building, then hire the staff, etc.The game is a grind in a bad way, but perhaps that's intentional, perhaps it is meant to be a statement on how call centers are, and I guess mission accomplished if that was the goal. Still, I would have wanted something with more humor, satire, and freedom in the gameplay. Also the sound effects get REALLY annoying since they can stagger, I guess again it is probably intentional, but it makes for a better statement of the call center world than it does an enjoyable simulation game."

The tutorial misses a LOT, and you quickly find yourself wondering what to do next, what to focus on, and how the mechanics of the game work. Many problems are found in the first 30 minutes of playing (e.g. ""hire X person to enable upgrade feature"". Hire that person, game still says ""hire this person to enable this feature""). Controls are frustrating (Can't easily move people between desks, have to do 1 at a time, which becomes increasingly lengthy when your offices are jam packed. This includes other micro-managing such as schedules, very cumbersome and frustrating design), the reports are semi-pointless and unhelpful, many offer no useful information and they also don't link to in-game objects (can see a report of employee happiness, but cant click to view employee, you must remember their name and scourer through your offices trying to find them). This game lacks a lot, and while it could be an excellent sim with a great and fun concept, it is poorly designed and bites off more than it can chew. Spend your money elsewhere, there are many other office sims which perform far better."

I was the guy who probly called you about Directv, Bank of America, or even sprint. Actually you called me because I was inbound not outbound. So what is actually cool about this game is you can name your Call Center whatever you want design it how you like and ultimatly run a call center. You will start by naming the call center setting up your 1st 3 rooms being inbound outbound and back office. In the call center world this doesnt always happen at the same site. It is ultimatly based on your contract. I have only ever had to do Inbound in most of why I did unless it was to call someone back. Now something that you will notice that is very real is that you will have a high turnover in this game, Why you may ask? Thats the Nature of the Beast in a call center either your worked to hard or not enough and youll defently experince this. Now as far as Gameplay is concerned it can be a bit slow at times and stacked against you do to the point you cant hire who you want when you want. you have to work to unlock all of this. In the call center world you would work from the ground up with HR Supervisors Opperations managers trainers QA teams and Tech. This is where the game loses it for me when you start out you have the option for IB OB and BO and thats it no HR no Supervisors to push no Opps managers no Trainers and for some reason this game doesnt have Quailty associates which is the key to a call center without Quality control that guy that is speaking with you on the phone could call you a dumb ignorant stupid head and there is nothing you could do about it except leave the company if that is your choice. So in Closing the game is good its not excellent or great it is good it delivers on some funny bits but it falls short on authenticty when it comes to the point of where you have to unlock everything. the game should be like here is your money build and thats it. so 3 stars out of 5 because it is fun youll have a good time playing it and there is a challenge the its not 5 stars because again lack of authenticty and the fact they make you unlock stuff that you need early on in the game. Do I recommend this game ? Yes especially if you work , have ever worked or are planning on working in a call center it will give you a bit of a taste or give you a parody of what it is like. Enjoy!"

The kind of game you play casually a dozen hours then take a moment, sit back, and say ""behold! Look at what I have created!"" While it is a fun game and has given me many hours of fun, casual builder/management fun it becomes a little troublesome to manage when things get complex and large. To be specific it's hard to get a good idea of who's doing what and who's assigned to what.  Would be perfect for me if they had a little more options, as in graphs and data to manage things when the tower and employees get large.No game is perfect and the fact that I even wrote a review at all shows that it will be enjoyable if you're into casual simulator/micro-management builder games, just probably not a game you'll likely sink hundreds of hours into."
