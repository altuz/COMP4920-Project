My girlfriend loves the game, and it's hard not to! You can dress your narwhal as anything you could want (like jedi knights, burritos, and more!!), and as far as entertainment goes, this game is second to none.My one request is that later on online playing be incorporated (for all of us who lack frequent human contact).Buy it now!"

Clash with other narhwhal CPU's, friends at your house, or just try to do an obstacle course on your own. One of the gamemodes you try to get as many points as you can by hitting a heart on another narwhals chest. Customize your narwhal with the style you love. The controls are simple, but that doesn't make the game easy. Here comes the hard part-moving. When flying around, the narwhals aren't very stable. This game is very unique.

,Recommended,263020,9187397,"Posted: 19 February, 2014",all,destroyalldreamers,"This is my favourite game featuring interstellar narwhals. It should be yours too.Narwhals (Monodon monoceros) are an aquatic mammal that live in the icy Arctic Ocean. In Old Norse nár means ""corpse"" for the animal's mottled grey skin colour resembled drowned sailors. It's scientific name is derived from Greek, meaning ""one-tooth one-horn."" It is this horn that is the defining characteristic of this majestic beast. Growing up to three metres in length the narwhal tusk is actually a tooth that pierces through the lip and protrudes past the upper jaw. The general consensus among scientific community is that this tusk is a secondary sex characteristic to garner attraction from all the lady narwhals (size does matter).Not alike their earthly narwhal cousins, the galactic starwhal also features such a tusk but this is not a tusk to attract mates, it is a tusk to destroy enemies (size does matter). The goal of game is simple, using your tusk, just the tip, you must impale the heart of your opponents. Only a strike to the heart will yield any damage and the game has a cool bullet-time slow-motion effect every time a heart is within range of being pierced.  It is a  hectic, tense, and often awkward struggle.As of right now it is an early access game but it is fully playable with only more content and game-modes to look forward to in the future. Its not really a game you can enjoy by yourself and there is no online multiplayer although that may change heading forward. The game shines with local co-op; best played with four players. I had no issues connecting and using four 360 controllers. It may lack in lasting appeal but if you have a few friends over and are looking for a quick, fun, and competitive gaming experience, look no further, looks to the stars."

The twitch of a thumbstick unerringly points the tip of the starwhal horn in a new fabulous direction, but only the horn. New players will need to get used to this. You can't turn the whale, just the tip o fthe horn. Once you understand this conept, the controls are actually fairly simple and precise. The gameplay is like a rainbow that has been crushed into crysaline form and mainlined through your eyeballs, it is fast paced and frantic couch coop in it purinst sense. I often throw this game up on a big projecter and it always draws crowds. People will scream when the horns start getting close to the enemy hearts and the camera zooms in for a slow motion shot.This game is absolutely amazing when ti works.

X to accept and O to go back. and to open up bots and player controlled characters, you have to use a ps3 combination like ^ + X + R1.For now, it is a game mainly for windows as i am experiencing some troubleshooting on my macbook air. although it still runs smoothly on 1.3 GHz, i cannot open the game on fullscreen as it will get stuck on the loading screen.

A couple people have said it was ""alright"" and wanted to give it a go, but no one lasted past their first fight.There are much better experiences for local multiplayer on Steam, and many are priced about the same.

This can seem a little annoying for people who just started to play the game, but really, just learn to play the game (I have never understood this problem which people have with learning curves).I would recommend this game, as it is only £6.99 at the time of writing this, so is quite cheap for a game which can be a different experience for each person you fight, as everyone brings new skills to this game."

Moving around in the old version was sheer joy, and players could play around, hug eachother, strike poses and, yes, even navigate accurately.The new backgrounds and pointless hats bring some diversity but also mess up the purity of the neon graphical style.Many of the levels are great though.

,Recommended,263020,10336398,"Posted: 3 June, 2014",all,NicolasNSane,"Version at Time of Review: Beta 4.1.1Starwhal: Just the Tip is a rollicking good time if you have friends to play with locally, along with the controllers to support up to 4-players. If you are a lone wolf gamer, the offerings become markedly less appealing, and it is likely you will not enjoy this title.As an Intergalactic Narwhal (Starwhal), you are tasked with something different depending upon the game mode in which you are playing. If you are playing any mode other than ""Zones"", your objective will absolutely be to stab other Starwhals in the heart whilst protecting your own, with the exception being one mode where there is only one heart, passed around as though it were hot potato. In ""Zones"", however, your objective is to flail your way through the arena and smack into nodes embedded in the walls, thus claiming them as yours and jettisoning any other Starwhals in their sphere of influence away from it. Any given zone is the color of whosoever owns it, and the sphere of influence surrounding it is a sort of viscous resistance, slowing your movement inside.Despite your mode of choice, the controls are simple yet impossibly imprecise. This is by design, and it helps to aid in the joy of the game. There are only three inputs of importance here: Direction Input (Be it keys or a joystick), the 'acceleration' button and, of course, a taunting Starwhal call for fun. You simply aim your Starwhal and hit the gas, but trying to keep your blubber warrior straight against the game's gravity and inertia is where the challenge comes in, leading to Starwhals circling around one another and dancing the delicate dance of death.The visuals are nice, with neon colors abound and streams following each player as they flail about the arenas. Sparks fly as a satisfying 'ching' sound effect plays out each time two Starwhals meet horn-to-horn, while a slow-motion bullet time effect plays out with a booming explosion of color and sound each time a heart is pierced. It's a bit confusing at times, what with all of the effects and colors, but overall looks quite nice and isn't too difficult to keep up with.If you're a player who enjoys the ability to customize characters, then you're in for a lite treat. There are two different types of items you can apply to your Starwhal, and several different kinds of each. Deck your space unicorn out with several different 'heads', then add on one of a plethora of torso outfits or, if you so desire it, a spaceman riding on their back with a game developer's face.If you have friends to play with, this is the kind of game that will have people shouting and names flying. There will be riotous laughter as two Starwhals do the belly wiggle on each other in attempts to get to one anothers' hearts, with echoing ""Oh's!"" as the camera zooms in and time slows down just to catch a very near miss. It really is a great time, and it caters to just about any skill level of player.If you are going to be playing alone, then you will not enjoy your time with Starwhal nearly as much. The AI has no taunting scripted whatsoever, nor are there any special sound-effects of any kind. You are literally just fighting the emotionless game, unable to even decorate your digital opponents with props without first joining their player slot, applying the items, then leaving and adding them in your place. Their intelligence ranges from 'impossibly good' to 'impossibly stupid', with some moments having them pull off insanely straight rams into a heart, while other times they balance on their horns against the floor, leaving themselves wide-open. It just isn't pleasant to have them be anything less than a complement to fill out empty player slots when playing with friends."

XD then you can have two players on the keyboard and one or two more on controllers.Negatives:  I really have no negatives for the game, and since the game has been release all bugs possible are pretty much exterminated.(This was written during summer sale 2017 so if you are reading this between June 22 and July 5 then I definetly recommend you pick this game up now for only 5 bucks."

I normally buy games for playing at home and others for the go on a low-spec laptop. So this game is just perfect for the second scenario."
,Not Recommended,263020,32954809,Posted: 28 June,all,Kal,"I used to play this game's demo on their website years ago. I was happy to find that it was on steam so I grabbed it on sale for $5. Like many of the other reviews have said you'll only get 10 minutes of fun out of this before whoever you're playing with is tired of it. You'll get just as much fun out of the demo (which doesn't seem to work anymore for me). It is a great game, but the full version doesn't have enough to offer for $12 and almost never going on sale.Try the demo and if you like it and want a version with a few more modes get this on sale.Sorry, Breakfall."

When I learned it was on steam, I inwardly screamed with joy, which was soon drowned out by an ACTUAL scream of joy, followed by some enthusiastic dancing. I love that they enhanced the graphics in this game, and added in outfits ^_^. The obstacle courses add some things to do when you're not playing with others, as well as acting as a fair way to practice your movement skills, which is a good bonus. THE ONLY qualm I have about this AMAZING game since it's been added to Steam, is that there has yet to be added an online multiplayer mode for it, which would make it even better! Imagine duking it out with spear-tipped noses against other players on Steam. Now doesn't that sound grand?"

It's hard to find a game with controls that are both ridiculous and tactful. I have mastered the controls, but I always enjoyed playing, even when I sucked. If you want the best experience, call up your friends. Starwhal is at it's best with other people. The hijinks are well worth the low price."
