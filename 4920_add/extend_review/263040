I really enjoyed the interaction process and figuring out what to say next. Plus there are tons of more interactions that can be explored in each level (I can see that from the achievements list) so theres a lot of replayability there. Can't wait for the next level to be released. Keep up the good work!!"

Highly recommend picking it up if you're a robo-nerd like me. It's an exciting look at human-machine interaction in games and beyond."
,Recommended,263040,14429860,"Posted: 10 February, 2015",all,bansama,"Bot Colony appeared rather promising when it released on Steam as part of the Early Access programme last year. It aimed to be the first game where you truly interacted with the characters through holding conversations with them. But it wasn’t until this month that the potential of this system was was hinted at through an update that introduced a need to pry information out of one of the characters .The task was to gain access to 14 recorded videos in an attempt to piece together the events of the last 48 hours in the home of a Nakagawa Robot Corp. employee. To do this required talking to Jimmy, a robot servant left in the house. And when I say talking, I actually mean talking. Either through speech recognition with a microphone or typing, Jimmy was capable of responding to questions posed in naturally flowing English.This certainly makes a refreshing change to only selecting from predefined dialogue options. And had the potential of revolutionizing interaction with game characters. Unfortunately, Bot Colony will cease to be playable in mid March. The result of not enough units being sold to cover the cost of running the server that processes the speech input, let alone paying for further development.There was a lot of promise in Bot Colony, and anyone interested in seeing that should check the store page on Steam. While no longer purchasable, one of the videos does cover the story as it would have unfolded. It is a shame that Bot Colony slipped under the radar, a likely victim of Steam’s increasing release schedule and lack of promotion. Had it done well it could have been a hit. When the game shuts down, I’m going to miss my conversations with Jimmy."

Often you'll tell the robots to move things, and it'll turn out that that was the wrong thing to do, it's completely irreversible, and you need to start the game over. I restarted many times and eventually gave up.The natural language understanding that was supposed to make this game so awesome seems like it's on par with text adventures from the 80s... not much beyond ""VERB NOUN.""It's too bad; the concept is good, and it sounded like the story could be great as well."
,Recommended,263040,10957506,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Sarie,"In its current state, I've had no problems running this game on my iMac running Windows 8.1 via Bootcamp. I usually do not purchase Early Access games, but I'm a total nerd for Asimov's Robot books and this game's notion of robots seems pretty reflective of Asimov's characterization of robots and their interaction with humans. I'm also a computational linguist, so the inclusion of NLU (Natural Language Understanding) had me very curious as well. NLU is complicated to achieve since meaning needs to be derived from an utterance, which sometimes means inferences must be made, but I think it works pretty well in this game, especially for the game being Early Access. I'd love to see the NLU improved and extended to other genres of games. But I think the first implementation--dealing with robots that don't always understand pragmatics--is a perfect first implementation."

Nice futuristic music nice atmosphere, beautiful level and character design. In the tutorial you learn how to command robots and interact with them. Sometimes you will find really funny sentences. Narrative, it's a good sci-fi thriller about industrial espionage and a bot colony where the machines went out of control. A game with high potential but it needs more audience so finally everyone can enjoy the conversations with the AI."
,Recommended,263040,32618691,Posted: 21 June,all,3v1lcl0n3,"Review after June 18 major upgradeIntroductionBot Colony is an ambitious title, aiming to provide a non-scripted story by allowing you to freely converse with robots. If you enjoyed literary works like 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep', Isaac Asimov's Robot series, movies like 'Space Oddysey 2001'(not one of my favorites though) or Anime like 'Ghost in the Shell' and 'Psycho-Pass', you'll find a similar setting here.An important remark is that most of the gameplay is text (or speech) conversations, which at times can be both agitating and humorous, and that might not appeal to everyone.Currently, the game is made of 2 episodes: Intruder and Arrival.IntruderYou have 2 objectives. The first one is erasing evidence of a thief breaking into the house, by commanding a robot (Jimmy). The other one is an investigation mission, which you can do at the same time, in which you question Jimmy about what happened at the house in the last 48 hrs. Jimmy will be saying some of his remarks/facts while moving around the house, which can be used as hints to what to ask. Although it might be a struggle at first, once you get used to commanding Jimmy (i recommend reading throughthe Robot Manual Guide).ArrivalThis is the first ""real mission"". it consists of multiple objectives that you'll discover while playing, talking with the receptionist, finding your luggage,finding a bag containing a bomb, within a time limit, getting a ride to your next location. A memorable moment was the talk with Charlie, a cleaner bot who'll help you with getting your ride.After 30 minutes of aggravation by asking all the bots about getting clearance for the ride, I was seriously amused when I realized the correct question line on how to get to the rideSummaryI enjoyed my playtime with BotColony and I'll be waiting for any further updates. If you have any interest on how the robots operate and your interaction with them, I'm sure you'll also enjoy it. While if you're only focused on 'the result' or why the robot isn't doing what you 'clearly' are telling it, you might have a rough ride. Keep also in mind that the game is an early access title, and not everything is polished yet.P.S.I played mostly through typing, Voice recognition is pretty decent with the new Microsoft API, but i find it more convenient to type. That said, voice recognition is not made by the developers and is one of the best available on the market. Also the devs like to hear community feedback, so feel free to drop your thoughts on the forums."

I have had some problems with the game on my side but Eugene from the Bot Colony team has been super nice to me and tried as hard as he could to help me so that I could play the game properly. I have been able to play the game despite my problems and the game has a very interesting concept of being able to talk to robots. And like any ""text-to-speech"" software or game, it can lead to some absolutely hilarious situations.So, despite the clunkiness of the game, the concept of it alone has been enough to charm me and make me play though the first scene. I am not finished with it, far from it, but I will play again and again with my wife until we go through it :)"

76561198138277157,Recommended,263040,30147426,Posted: 24 February,all,thuvicious,"Bot Colony is certainly a unique experience. You can use your voice to control the game. You don't have to use your voice, but I would suggest taking the time to train the voice software. It makes the game basically hand free and I feel you get the desired effect.  It brings me back to the Dreamcast days when I used to play Seaman and talk to my fish for hours. Fortunately, time has had a positive effect on voice software and Jimmy ( the robot in-game that you talk to) can understand me far better than my virtual Dreamcast fish could ever dream to. It's pretty casual but it is a good time. If you have ever seen Irobot, you know that sometimes it is the way you word your question to a robot that decides how it will respond. There is an element to the game where you have to question Jimmy to find out what happened before you got there. I really enjoyed that. Like I was Will Smith in Irobot. Either way, it was fun and in my opinion worth my time."

Binary Domain) but, this isn't about just simple commands, we are talking about interactions with in-game characters. I am the first to admit that I stayed a long time in the first part of the game talking to a small robot just to know what it can do and it was absolutely amazing.I followed this project since when it was on Greenlight and Indie DB and I know how many efforts and sacrifices have been put on it.I recommend this game, not only because it's amazing, but because you can help the developers make it even better and this is what this game deserve."

I just bought it and haven't had much time to play until now but just the idea of the game is great.I had the chance to talk to the robot in the first mission (or better I typed). I've had opportunity to try to talk to some A.I. in the past before, but this is something else. I can only imagine the work involved in making such a game.A.I. has been fascinating to me as long as I can think (about nearly four centuries) and I am already surprised how well it works if I pay attention to how I am saying things (and in how many words).I can see that there are quite some hurdles to overcome for the developers, so I am not disappointed at all, when not everything works as I would expect if I were talking to another human. Humans expect quite a lot from each other when talking - for example if talking about a chair and later someone asks what color that chair had - I am not sure an A.I. could reason that far, because there might be other chairs around and it just does not know which chair is meant.This is game is some serious stuff and I can only hope the developers get as far as they hope to. I haven't played long enough to tell you anything about the later game just now, but the potential of this game is unbelievably.But I might be biased because of my fascination with robots, A.I. and the like. I'd say this is a game that needs some serious support. Thumbs up for progress so far and I am curious what else I might get from this game."
76561197970479670,Recommended,263040,33361511,Posted: 7 July,all,Geldon,"When's the last time you played a game involving hiding your involvement in the scene of a crime by remote-control verbal communication with a robot who operates in a real 3D space?  In a gaming world where we've stopped complaining about clones and accepted them as the norm, novel gameplay is as rare as hens' teeth.  In this way, Bot Colony is well worth your time, attention, and support.  That alone deserves my thumbs up.That said, though it has been getting worked on for quite some time, it looks a bit dated, and the actual gameplay in Bot Colony is really klunky. It could be worse, but the things it does well are the things most players are not going to notice, and the things it does poorly are showstoppers.If you have ever played an old school text adventure, you might understand the frustration of trying to wrap your head around the developer's means of communication.  How do you tell a robot to place a shaker of salt exactly how it looks like in a picture?  I have no idea, the AI is smart enough to put it on the table to the left of a coffee maker and that's no minor achievement in programming, but I can't figure out how to tell it to put it down exactly where it needs to be.  I guess that kind of difficulty makes sense when you add 3D space to a text adventure.  Anyway, I have not been able to get past the tutorial.One thing they keep trying to add to Bot Colony is voice recognition, but I have yet to see it working particularly well.  Basically, they're thinking it would be really cool if they have an AI you can talk to with your voice and that AI can do things for you, and they've been spending a lot of development time on getting that to work.  As a player, I would have preferred they fix the gameplay problems first, but I guess they develop other products that make use of voice recognition so that's their agenda.  Fortunately, you can also type your commands.As for the long development time, behind the scenes there have been some major financial issues, and this has slowed progress on the game quite a bit, to the point where it's fair for a player to wonder who is left to work on it?  Lately, the game seems to somehow be making progress, so that's encouraging.  I hope these guys continue to put out novel game concepts."
