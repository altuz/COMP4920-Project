76561198146292727,Recommended,263060,19814749,"Posted: 20 December, 2015",all,ScaRy,"This is among the best games I've had the pleasure of playing, hands down.It's a shame this game doesn't get the attention it deserves. There's a small, yet loyal following that genuinely wants this game to be the best it can be. Even though it's a voxel-based FPS, it far exceeds your run-of-the-mill CoD or BF in many aspects. It's the simplicity of Blockstorm that makes it beautiful.What's great about this game is amount of customization available through the in-game editor. You can create your own knife skins, guns, mechas, player models, and can even forge your own maps with ease. Because of this, there's a ton of free community-created content via the Workshop. You don't have to sell your house, car, and your left testicle for a knife skin like you would in CS:GO. Just subscribe to an item in the Workshop, and you're good to go.There is one main criticism I would give this game: The ping. If I had a lamborghini for everytime I shot someone in the face without them dying, I would be Tai Lopez. It's not uncommon to see pings above 150. It can be frustrating dying to someone you KNOW you should have killed. This is one of the reasons why this game may never be competitively viable. However, you'll learn to shrug it off and keep playing. It's still a blast to play!For the price of a burger, you just can't beat it. Skip food for a day. Buy this game."
,Recommended,263060,32632826,Posted: 21 June,all,The Grey Raven,"This game may be easily seen as a Minecraft style shooter that tries to get popular from this tactic, and as such it could make you think it has nothing to offer. This can obviously stimulate people to ignore it or read reviews skeptically. If you are reading this, you either probably want to get this game or think you may want to. I am going to tell you what this game really is and why you may want to spend your time in Blockstorm.Blockstorm is obviously indeed a Minecraft with guns scenario, though the features this game brings are much more than you would expect. You can find most of these nowhere else. Here are my pros. This game has a very in depth editor for every single visual element in the game. Whatever you see here you can make look different and as such personalize it for yourself or others depending on what you want your role to be in this community. These visual elements include weaponry, edited based on class, (such as making an assault rifle or knife skin), maps, characters, and even NPCs. Each of these are produced in an also voxel based editor with small blocks used to make them. Next, all of the maps in the game are fully destructible minus forcefield blocks. This and the weapon editor makes everything in the game extremely dynamic, to a level of Battlefield if not more. For example, say you are on an oil rig. You walk up a building to shoot two people on a bridge battling. You pull out your nyan cat rocket launcher and begin aiming at your prey. You easily realize Big Smoke and that Spetznaz guy aren't going to enjoy this. The rocket is fired, blowing the entire bridge up and making it fall into the water to be gone the entirety of the match.Now for the much smaller list of my cons. Blockstorm is faced with the extremely unfortunate lack of funding. The creators are led by IndieGala, who no longer pay GhostShark for this game's development. This means since the game wasn't popular to begin with, it certainly began to lose the little steam it had to begin with. Fortunately though, there are still 156 and counting dedicated players in this community, and they are here to stay. This means that the community is more connected, which may not be seen as a con to some people. Also, as you can't sprint, grenades can be op in this game. This is an issue that can be avoided, though not easily sometimes. It seems to appear in this game that it has a lower ping refresh rate, so people won't get hit sometimes in higher ping servers.Overall, this game has immesurable dynamisism, and a dedicated community for all the fps needs you should have, regardless of its numbers and other minor development bugs. Thank you for reading this, I hope it helped you decide."

This game in short is Ace of Spades revived with a big focus on gameplay along the lines of Counter Strike 1.6 and Half Life 1 Multiplayer. It really is great fun and the graphics kind of give it a charm that makes it feel like it comes straight out of 1998 or something. The block based levels are great, giving you tons of ways to play a match for example literally pumping a 100 bullet mag into a wall just so other people don't have the cover of said wall anymore. Of course you can also place blocks yourself, building small walls to crouch behind when you reload.Basicly if you like Counter Strike-ish games with a little twist this sure is a game to pick up, especially now when its on sale.And the editor where you can make maps, skins for your weapons and for your characters isamazing. Easy to use for everyone and so many options to be creative with. I bet this is where most people will spend their time."

The major pros about this game is that the weapons are well-balanced, but what would be great if the Sniper Rifle were like the AWP from CS: Source and harder to use, because campers have it easy. Anyways, the other pro is the speed of the combat; it's not too slow like CS:GO, but not too fast like Quake. But a neutral point about this game is the lack of players; give it some attention! But a negative about this game is.... hard to come up with.9.5/10 because of the very small amount of annoying players that I have seen. The playerbase is like a box of Crayola brand crayons: creative and non-toxic. Honestly, give this game more players."
,Recommended,263060,23467212,"Posted: 9 June, 2016",all,Furball,"Ok, let’s get this review started. For those of you that want a brief overview (or those of you that can't be stuffed reading the massive review below), there is a pros/cons list down underneath the actual review.PROSFirst good thing is that the game has a weapon, player model, and map maker, which is rather nice, as it brings a personal touch to the game.Second good thing is It has workshop support which is also quite nice.Third, is the pretty decent game-play, although the lag is a mild problem, its mainly due to the horrible internet where I live.Another upside is the balanced weapons.And the fifth and likely most important upside, is the completely destructible environments that don't take a beast of a computer to run.Next, there is the sixth good thing...the MECHS...Completely awesome and deadly, those things tear through almost anyone in their path. They take a fair few missiles to bring down too.On a final point, you can create your own servers quickly and easily.CONSFirst off, the editors are rather limited. The gun and player model editor are ridiculously frustrating with the editor being unable to remove most blocks from both gun and player model is infuriating. I could understand if it was a single block in the middle of the gun or at the back, however unfortunately you cant remove half the gun and/or the middle layer...for unexplained reasons. On top of that, the size of editing space is incredibly limited, only allowing you to place one or two blocks in any direction outside of the original gun, which makes it extremely frustrating if you are trying to make your machine gun look like the heavy lancer from Ratchet and Clank 2...Not sure how many people remember that game...ANYWAY, back to the review. On to the map editor. The editor is relatively less limited, however the inability of placing very many NPC's in a small area is annoying to say the least when trying to create a zombie survival. Another downside is that the map editor can at times be borderline confusing with what is considered the actual map, and what isn't.The second downside is that-despite the weapons being balanced, there simply aren't enough to make the game feeldifferent from most other shooters.The third downside is that other than an A.I for turrets and zombies, there are no bots.The fourth downside is that you have to be online to play, even to just test an edited map or piece of equipment.LIST OF PROS AND CONSPROS-Mostly balanced weapons-Decent game-play-Bi-pedal mechanical walkers (Giant walking things with a minigun, rocket launcher and what seems to be a power-fist :P)-Editors-for the personal touch that you need while mass-murdering everyone in your path with a bright orange machine-gun while looking like a storm trooper..,-Workshop support so you can upload your creations and make use of what other's have uploaded. Useful for doing what is mentioned above :P-You can make your own server and watch as it fills up with random players from around the globe :PCONS-Editors are extremely limited-but have good potential.-Not enough weapons...(THERE CAN NEVER BE TOO MANY WEAPONS...well..most of the time)-No A.I/Bots (except zombies/turrets)-Online play only-no editing maps and playing them offline.And finally, dear reader, you stumble in relief over what is known as a summary :PSo, decent shooter at its core, but it needs a lot of modification with the editors, as well as requires actual A.I to fight against offline. I'd personally recommend buying it on sale.Thats all for this review. Dragon out."

,Recommended,263060,15528589,"Posted: 24 April, 2015",all,optimuswhat,"This game is pretty fun!Imagine Ace of Spades, except actually improved upon and not turned into a Call of Duty-like game. It features a variety of weapons and interesting mechanics. I think one of the big sellers of the game is its custom weapon and playerskin makers, as well as map making system. The combat is fairly good, though it has room for improvement. I found that matches tend to be rather... Quiet. It felt somewhat isolated when playing with other players. Hopefully the community grows to circumvent this issue.The loadout system is very interesting. There's a weight (In KG) system that dictates how fast you move. If it's 6 KG, you move pretty fast. If you weigh 10 KG, you'll be slower.There's weapons like a rifle, a sniper rifle, an assault rifle, an SMG, a shotgun, and a heavy machine gun. They all tend to synergize well with a certain side-arm. Yes, there's more than just your pistol. You're given the choice between choosing a regular pistol, uzi, and a small shotgun with two shells loaded in. Ontop of that, you can also pick your grenade type. It can be a frag grenade, a C4 that can be detonated on command, a claymore that detonates when a player touches its laser, or a freakin' RPG... With only one rocket.You can also use a block placing tool and a shovel to manipulate the terrain.A few issues I have encountered is that the game does NOT autosave your custom skins, maps, characters, etc. This means if you accidentally quit, it's gone. Yes, it happened to me when I was least expecting it. Another issue that I feel like only I get annoyed by is making weapon skins. Whenever you make a weapon skin, there's certain blocks that cannot be broken. This is so that you don't make an SMG look like a shotgun. I tend to get a little annoyed with it, but I can understand why it's there. I would like if there was some system that lets you delete those blocks, but on the offset that only you can see the skin. The only other issue is that the community is small. Hopefully by the end of the two week free-to-play event, the community would had grown by then.Other than that, it's pretty good. Get it if you liked the original Ace of Spades. Cheers for monthly updates!"

Players have nearly 100% freedom in designing their own character, equipment and even maps. Designes can be shared through Steam Workshop, in which others simply need to click 'Subscribe' in order to download the designs and use it for their own.However, these are the only things that attracts me to this game.The gameplay itself is boring as ♥♥♥♥.Currently, there are only RPG, LMG, MP5, AK, UZI, Shotgun, Sniper, rifle and handguns in which all of these have horrible sound effect and it makes you feel like you're using a card board gun made in China.Character actions are basic and you are only limited to aim-shoot, run, crounch and jump. No sprinting, diving, or lying on the ground. If you want to play Super Mario in 3D, this game is for you.Grenades are ♥♥♥♥ing annoying in this game. Each players are supplied with 2 grenades every spawn and this makes the match into a grenade dodgeball where players throw their grenade before they shoot when they see an opponent.Knifes are also one slice kill with zero sound effect where it makes you feel like you're cutting through tofu.The only unique part about the game play is that the blocks are destructable, and it is interesting seeing the battlefield constantly change its shape and how players must move differently according to the change.But remember, the rest is total sh!t.The only hope to enjoy this game is to use most of your time designing and if you are want a good gameplay experience, I recommend you to bring your friends.Overall:Good concept but lack of polishing.I understand that the game community is not big yet and the devs do not have a large income from this game, but this is my honest impression of this game at its current state."

However, the graphics do not affect the gaming experience whatsoever. Blockstorm feels like a proper FPS game, and the map destruction, and ability to build structures/barriers using blocks provided to all players, result in often unique gameplay every time.The guns, although a small number, have their own feel and characteristics. Unlike other FPS', Blockstorm is successful at delivering a different combat experience with each weapon. The sniping mechanics were a little difficult to master, but the skill necessary to one-shot kill your enemies is cleverly nerfed with the scope sway.The maps and game modes seem very appropriate for the price tag, and the map/character editor give you an even bigger bang for your buck.The player mobility is affected by gear type and weight. This feature encourages the player to think about the weapons and gadgets to carry to be effective in the current combat situation, or to match their playing style.Blockstorm does have its issues. One of those is the spawn system; the enemy team can overpower your team and spawn kill quite easily. There is a few seconds of invincibility right after spawning, but a skilled spawn killer can ruin your game regardless of this feature.Overall the game is worth every penny, and a must have indie FPS.NEW INFOAfter giving it some thought I forgot to mention another major issue the game has, and I feel obligated to share this information to avoid encouraging people to make a purchase without this knowledge.The game, at its current state, does not have a large player population. It can be difficult to get a full server, but most of the time when I have played I actually found one or two servers running with enough players. I do not believe this is an issue with the game itself, but with the lack of popularity. As previously mentioned, the game deserves a larger population."

Oh boy was I fooled.Not much more alive than GC - except during sales (but that happens in any game) or DEMO servers (which like the name says, it has demo players) - and with gameplay similar or worse than GC I've felt completely tricked by those reviews.While in GC most people still had the patience to make their own gun just for their own sake/fun, I doubt here anyone will waste time making a full scale playermodel since the developers made like 25 of them. And since it doesn't have gun maker did they compensate with more standard weapons? Nope, I believe it has even less standard guns than in GC himself. Sure it has the basic weapon types (assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun), but personally the only gun I find effective is the machine gun.Without mentioning that layout management enforces you to ""run"" (there's no sprinting) overcombered in a game that you ""GOTTA GO FAST"". Each gun/tool has a certain weight. The heavier you are, the slower you ""run"". This means either you like it or not you'll always have to ""run"" with things you may not use in the match. But even if you did carry a rocket launcher or more combersome weapons, would it make a diference? Nope because you'd be running extremely slow.Also has a map maker that nobody will have enough time to make anything good.It kinda made me depressed waste 12€ on such game. As if that wasn't enough 2 weeks later the game gets a weekend sale for 5€. In times like this you wish steam would make refunds. (At the time of purchase steam didn't had refunds yet).If you bought the game, hope you enjoy selling your cards. If you haven't but still feel inclined to try it out, get the demo and play on the populated demo servers (the non-demo are empty).

,Recommended,263060,14431525,"Posted: 11 February, 2015",all,LtKaiden,"This review is for the early access Blockstorm. Sit down and listen to me carry on and allow me bore you to death. :)Brief SummaryDon't get me wrong, there are many games out there that allow you to build your own maps out of blocks and then allow you and some friends, or some random people to completely lay waste on your map. Although most of them are unfortunately terrible, sometimes due to pay to win with the free to plays, or some just are out there in Early Access floating around trying to grab your money with a game that is only 20% complete. No, this game is not like this. I can easily say that I had fun with this game with the many shenanigans that have happened to both me and my mates. Despite the lack of servers, as the only official servers that aren't empty are demo servers meaning the player will need to host their premium servers to play their maps with other premium members.Now I'm going to go back for a moment, and trust me I won't take long. This game is fairly limited content wise, there are very little prefabs, however I have noticed that more and more prefab packs are being released in the workshop, which is very good. The weapons are lacking in numbers and the gameplay mechanics can be refined. Again however this game has only been out for a short while, and in my time from when I bought it, I have noticed quite a few interesting changes and additions such as turret editors, new developer made maps (which I really don't care much for as the buzzing workshop community has made.) I really do see much potential for this little, but as this is only gameplay wise, as again the weapons are lacking, some of the animations can be cleaned up and multiple other implementations would be nice.I actually urge you to buy this then to play the demo as that means the community grows and the developers get more money to kickstart this game from where it is now to a full complete game in no time.Pros- It's fun editing and creating maps... then completely annihilating them with friends.- The workshop community is always at it creating new refreshing and unique maps.- This game is fairly good for what it's potential may become.- It's got some pretty fun maps, despite them being on the demo servers.- Endless creativity, building tunnels, to making massive defense towers it's almost endless with the map maker.Cons- It does need a bit more content, however it is still in very early access.- Unfortunately this game is overrun with demo users... again I urge you to buy this to support the developers.- It is fairly basic, some new mechanics would go a long way."
,Recommended,263060,12388294,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,Uboa Noticed You,"Before you read this review, might I say that the demo is worth trying out to get a sense of the actual gameplay, as the only thing it limits you from is building things in the editors and locks you to only a few weapons.Anyway, Blockstorm is a strange FPS to describe. Unlike most other voxel manshooters / ""Minecraft with GUNZ"" games that I've tried, the customization and building aspect mostly takes a background role to the combat mechanics inside actual matches, making the FULLY destructible maps feel more like Battlefield than Minecraft, while having the scale of neither. While you can dig your way underground to an enemy spawn and build fortifications, the building side is pretty limited to just doing that, which I sorta like. It makes the game feel more focused and more like an FPS with sandbox elements rather than Minecraft with guns and multiplayer, which doesn't really work well.The combat is pretty dull at the current stage. The weapons handle like CoD and shoot like Battlefield, but the movement takes heavy influence from Counter-Strike, in that you have no sprint and movement exploits are incredibly difficult to pull off and end up feeling unimpressive. All in all, it's slow. Not clunky, but slow. Respawning back at your base and making your way all the way back to the battlefield can be frustrating at times in a game where the strategy side is a bit underdeveloped, so most players possess the inclination to just look for guys to shoot.---While that hardly sounds like a recommendation, this game still has a few things going for it; the sheer amount of potential and strong creative tools are huge counterweights to an otherwise average shooter, and given that the game gets updates fairly regularly, Blockstorm could turn into a fantastic large scale FPS to the likes of Star Wars: Battlefront.When in huge battles, the game really opens up. Fully destructible environments that can be rebuilt as resources permit means that the search for cover is always tense, especially in the thick of battle. A well placed grenade can demolish enemy cover, opening them up to hellfire, and collapsing buildings can be pretty painful. The health regen is slow enough that being shot can have an actual impact on your play instead of hiding behind an indestructible wall for 10 seconds. Building trenches and repairing walls with makeshift patches of blocks is a great experiance when you actually get around to doing it, as the gameplay doesn't really encourage you to at the current stage unless your enemy is smart and whittles away at the map default cover at key points. They need to revamp the gun mechanics to suit this slower style of gameplay, since it feels good when it actually comes together.The two editors, the map editor and character editor, are very strong, and can push the game to even greater levels if a few creative users get their hands on it. I haven't really used the map editor much, but from the levels I played that were designed in them (that being all of them, as the devs use the tool to create their maps) I can tell it's competent. The character editor is really good and quite a bit of fun. It breaks everything into manageable chunks, and you can start from scratch or edit a skin you already have. You can even import and export parts individually and paste them in at any time, as well as select sections and copy them to a clipboard for use later. You want a minotaur head on a small anime girl body? Go for it, nothing is stopping you! Granted, this makes the game look like a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥ in regards to the player models on the field, but it's nothing gamebreaking (maybe a force player / enemy model option á la CPMA, devs?)---Overall, I've had a lot of fun with Blockstorm, and I hope you give the demo a try at the very least. If the devs make some adjustments to how the combat feels (and MAYBE up the movement speed)  and put more emphasis on the strategy side of building, and if the player base allows bigger, more open ended battles, this can turn into something great. I hope to see you in battle, hypothetical reader. I'll be the chick in a bad Christmas sweater with a bow and a giant CRT monitor for a head."
,Recommended,263060,15524649,"Posted: 24 April, 2015",all,GoldMan27,"A VERY fun game. It's like Counter-Strike and Minecraft had a baby (or rather, it's like Ace of Spades when it was still good). You can make your own skin literally block by block (and the skins in this game are VERY detailed because of it), you can even edit the turret and zombie skins (yes, there are zombies in the game!) You can even customize your weapons so they look whatever you want them to look like (though there are some minor restrictions in that field, it's still cool). To top it off, it even has a MAP EDITOR, so you can make whatever kind of map you want, build your own prefabs (structures that you can later use as assets for other maps or share), and pick what modes and weapons you want on the map! You could have snipers only, make it run for Team Deathmatch or CTF, etc.All in all, this game will never leave you bored of creativity, and it's a really solid game (aside from some minor bugs, but again, MINOR bugs). I fully recommend this game to anyone who wants a nice Minecraft-style shooter with good weapons balance, and a wide variety of creative tools at your disposal.

On one hand, you got an average, not particullary interesting voxel FPS, on the other hand you got a good interface to create skins for characters, items and creating maps. The good side, anyone can make a skin, the bad side, ANYONE can make a skin. If you where looking for a Achan shooter, a 9gag counterstrike clone, look no further. Every and any meme ever posted already has a skin: Pepe, Sonic, Dat Boi, Pedo Bear, AWESOME, there's even a nyan cat rocket launcher. There's also a pink uniform Hitler with his junk showing I wish I could unsee.The FPS gameplay is average. It plays a little like Counterstrike in that headshots are a sure kill, but you can stomach a few body shots. It has quite a few different game modes, DM, TDM, CTF, zombies, and Assault (one team assaults the other defends). Everything is destroyable and you have building blocks like in all minecraft clones. Other than that, the physics suck.The variety of weapons is actually very small, you have ONE assault rifle, ONE sniper rifle, ONE machinegun, ONE pistol, two shotguns and two SMG, but only because they can be used as primary or secondary. It has endless skins, which makes up for the lack of variety, but it doesn't matter if the assault rifle looks like a kalashnikov or a candy cane, it will play the same.Also on the bad side, the character skins don't have a first person render, only the guns, so you only get to see the skin you choose when you are killed or if you win the game (cool victory pose for the 3 top players).I can't say this is the best FPS out ther, but it's ok for it's price (bought it on sale, though). If you want to create skins or maps, this is a great and easy to learn tool.I appreciate Linux support."

It's one of the few italian games to actually be nice. So, let's stop talking and discuss thePROS+Good game balance: Weapons are pretty well balanced between each other.+Weapons are few, but fill all the needed roles. There's a gun for everything, even if the weapons are less than your usual FPS. This actually makes it easier to understand each weapon and encourages competitive play.+Simple, clean HUD. Tells you everything you need, without being too fancy and clutter the screen with useless stuff.+Very good surround audio. The sounds may not be the best ones, but sure as hell stereo saved my life plenty of times. Footsteps are the key.+Easy to learn, extremely hard to master.+Simple, light to run graphics show you only what really matters, and as such it will be easy to get your friends on the game.+Custom SkinsBlockstorm has it's fair share of pros... But there are alsoCONS-Custom Skins (yes, it's both a + and a -, as it hinders competition)-Some weapons could use a little more balancing. Guns are well balanced... But some of them could still use some tweaking, seeing how the pistol is useless.-Inconsistent hits. Yes, you really don't feel like hitting the enemy. He wont flinch, he won't really bleed, just a barely visible splurt of cubic blood after every shot. Makes it a bit hard to tell when the enemy has been hit, and the hitmarkers are hard to see(illuminating crosshair)-Inconsistent explosives: the explosive weapons are really awkward and bipolar, sometimes you get a rocket in the face and survive to get your revenge, sometimes a grenade lands really far (and even behind a wall!) and you die instantly.-Tracers: They are there just for show, and won't really show the actual shots you're firing: the actual hitscans are MUCH more accurate than what the tracers show.-Not really a development fault, but the game is slowly dying. There are still a lot of people playing, but i feel like it won't last long...------------------------VerdictBlockstorm is a simple, catchy shooter.

The editor not only allows you to create a map but you can also create your own prefabs (objects, walls, props etc and add it to your prelab library) but you can download new ones from the community and also share your own creations as well and of course your maps. The map editor is quite powerful, you can easily copy complete objects big or small to duplicate including very large buildings. This makes things like creating roads or wanting to duplicate multiple objects easy.  If you want to cut your teeth on designing good multiplayer maps this is it. There could be some minor tweaks and polish added to the editor to improve its ease of use but its not hard to learn and does the job well.I'm impressed with how there are no frps drops from some of the detailed and large maps some of the community (some good quality maps there) has made for an older computer like mine.At the moment there is only 3 game modes but more is to come.

RP)-Custom Weapons (and possibly edit the stats)-Workshop support(it's been implemented. YAY)Edit: I've noticed a lot of discussions based around on whether or not this game is different from Ace of Spades, Guncraft, and any other voxel shooter out there. And I, as a reviewer, should set an answer to a potential game loss. This game does stand on it's own in it's own right.Yes, it takes certain elements from AOS, but don't always think it rips off. Blockstorm was likely inspired by AOS, and it adds onto what AOS had done, though doing it in it's own way.Yes, the shooting may be a bit generic, but it can be very tactical if you play with the right people. The game was designed to be a bit slow paced, almost like Battlefield.Anyone who is against this game, whether by similarities with the other voxel shooters, I do hope you give it a chance as it's own title. It's nowhere near as terrible as some have said, but rather good.And besides, it's in Early Access. It may improve, it may setup or add, it IS changing whether you like it or not, possibly for the better or even worse.To conclude...This game is something you could pick up and enjoy on the spot (For me it was). Being able to create your own character in ANY way you wanted to is something that makes this cake shine. I also enjoy making maps, as the editer is very good. And currently with a price tag of $12(It may change), it's cheaper and better than the $15 AOS."

It's definitely how I wanted and what AoS should have been. Tons of customization available for both player models and guns, with the only limits being the model bases and your imagination. Great *if a tad repetitive after awhile* music that highly invokes old arena shooters. The battlefield is dynamic and ever changing building crumble bunkers are built craters appear after explosions etc. The guns themselves are quiet nice too, They feel like they have actual power behind them with the recoil system though the same cant really be said for melee as more often than not it feels extremely floaty and leaves me oft wondering if I even hit the enemy at all while my corpse topples to the floor from a silent blow.

It's not too hard to create these things either, it has a pretty good editor.

The gunplay is based on loadouts of equipment that vary in power, and weight/speed. You can dig, and place blocks to shape the environment to your advantage, while competing with the enemy in objective game modes, and or deathmatch. So far, so generic. But when playing the actual game, I found a fine game that can give you a good time if you want to play a destructive shooter with in game tools to make your own fun.The customization tools to visually alter your own guns, melee , power ups, and player models. helps personalize the game for the creative while keeping the distinctive sounds, and stats of each gun to avoid balance issues. The tools themselves are fun, and easy to use to create your gun models. from the simple melee weapon to your own full character models, and if all else fails, you can reskin the RPG pink in about 10 clicks.You can also Build maps as well, something the workshop has used to make many things. The map editor is almost exact like the gun editor. but with pickups, and blocks with varying durability. and environmental editing to layout the map of your creation. But with The dozens of strange, and fun Workshop Maps, and the abstract beauty of the “Built in” maps. You’ll have so many maps to Discover, Download, Drop in, and Demolish.A game, that has still got some servers kicking (As of 6/17/2016) and is a fine time with creative friends who could use a diet of destruction based sub arena shooting, with an surprisingly good looking set of maps to utterly destroy.

I usually hate all these block related games that seem to spin-off the already dreadful Minecraft, but this game is very fun to play. It allows complete customization of all of your own weapons and character, and the blocks actually make it simple enough for anyone to design something. The in game editor is simple to learn, it only took me about an hour to begin making my own stuff.The gameplay of a shooter is pretty good too. It's a little realistic for a block game. I don't know all the weapons, but they all seem to be based on a real gun. They all work fairly well, even though I was annoyed the sniper rifle shakes while walking. Very realistic.The game modes are rather interesting, but could use more balancing. The zombies mode is even still PvP and PvE at the same time. I hope a simpler co-op mode is added eventually. But really most of the game modes are all known game modes that anyone uses, it's not very unique. It's still nice though.I'd recommend it."

Thirdly, the pace of the game is a mess, it has the movement speed of slower games, like the original halos, but fast kills, like the ones in more modern games, which results in annoying combat. And finaly, the low population of the game means even if you enjoy it, with all the defects, you will rarely find a server that feels different fron a ghost town with barely five players on most of them.Each one of these issues could be overlooked alone, but the combination of them makes this game feel like a chore to play, and therefore, while the game is promising, i cannot recomend the acuisition of such.If the game improoves, and refines these aspects, i will change my review."

There's a small, yet loyal following that genuinely wants this game to be the best it can be. Even though it's a voxel-based FPS, it far exceeds your run-of-the-mill CoD or BF in many aspects. It's the simplicity of Blockstorm that makes it beautiful.What's great about this game is amount of customization available through the in-game editor. You can create your own knife skins, guns, mechas, player models, and can even forge your own maps with ease. Because of this, there's a ton of free community-created content via the Workshop. You don't have to sell your house, car, and your left testicle for a knife skin like you would in CS:GO. Just subscribe to an item in the Workshop, and you're good to go.There is one main criticism I would give this game: The ping. If I had a lamborghini for everytime I shot someone in the face without them dying, I would be Tai Lopez. It's not uncommon to see pings above 150. It can be frustrating dying to someone you KNOW you should have killed. This is one of the reasons why this game may never be competitively viable.

Yeah ... maybe the low number of players makes this game unplayable BUT indigala (they made this game) work for this game and they add new things like weapons! So from time to time there will be much more players and it makes still fun by creating a skin for your character or weapons.

Everyone has differen't skill sets in this game.Bad things about this game1) Its a FPS shooter, like CoD and its like CoD and Minecraft slaped to each other.2) Building stuff takes along time if you want to make something decent. Voxel by voxel pretty much3) Communinty like I said is good, but the new 10 year old kids that buy this game spam the chat insaulting people and being immature. -_-4) RPG's you can not fire on depend you have to wait for like 3 seconds before you can fire.5) Last but not least, You can fit in 1x1 by 1x2 spaces which is kind of weird considering that my guys is like the scale of a minecraft character and these little voxels are like 1 foot by 1 foot or less hahahaOther than that this game is pretty fun, hardly any gliches.

,Recommended,263060,22129663,"Posted: 29 March, 2016",all,『TheAwkwardCoder』,"*MAY 2016 VERSION*I would have to say, I actually like this game. A lot.Parts of the community are decent, and as long as you can find the right people, you can learn how to play pretty quickly.Although, one of the only complaints I have about it for now is that the Hunt matches could use more maps. Currently it's only the infested map, and it gets a bit boring after a while to be able to play Hunt on only one map. Other than that, it's a pretty great game! Especially when you see the workshop content! All the awesome player and weapon skins, quite a few people have contributed to this game's greatness! And finally, I will get down to it.Pros:Decent CommunityA great amount of workshop contentThere is at least 1 server active a day6 guns that are all special in their own wayYou can literally just run around and knife peopleKill Deadpool as a duck with a Steam Sale RPGYou can literally have a stick thin gunBlowing up everything is funThe fact that you don't pay for new skins, and still have CS:GO skinsCons:Some parts of community are a bit iffy than the restIf you suck at aim, you will suck at the game (not guarenteed)The spawnkilling techniques of some players, ripThe fact that there's only one map for HuntSo yeah, that's my review on the game. Still though, the spawnkills.*UPDATE: MAY 2017*Well, it's been about a year since I reviewed this game, so I figured I should update my review.As the community currently stands, I've been playing more active than I have a year ago, and...Well, a lot of players who were helpful, active, or high-ranked players, have seemed to completely abandoned this game by this point. It's pretty rare to see anybody above lvl 90 join a server, ever, except on weekends or during random games with 6 or more people. The majority of players are either lvl 1's, scattered levels between 2-50, and the lvl 70's. Although, this remaining small portion of the community can be divided into seperate groups.Group 1: New players that are completely silent, either not knowing how to talk or choosing not to. This silent group also applies to some higher level players, who don't speak much.Group 2: The remaining bad part of the community. Either people who spam gg ez in your face all the time or complain about other people being bad, they don't come up too often but you do see them in games. Most of these people will complain that it's a dead game, which in my opinion leads to the question: Then why are you even playing a game you don't believe in? Are you serious?Group 3: The relatively ideal players, these players will chat occassionally, or often, possibly supply supportive information, or come up with some interesting chat topics as you stalk each other on the maps. Sometimes you can even arrange events between yourselves, such as limiting everybody to a certain weapon and providing some occassionally fun times. Although they are decently rare, you'll still see them, and they will provide some of the best times in this game. All of my good memories about this game come from these people, they MAKE the game realtively fun, absolutely.Skins are still being made daily for this game, so the steam workshop support is still going strong. Overall, your purchase of this game is kind of relative. The times this game is most active will always be on the weekends, since the community likes to hold events during the weekend. That is, the active parts of the community. Ultimately, it depends on whether you can spare some money for this game. I would never reccomend buying the full price for this game, especially in its current state. $7 for this game would be an absolute bad deal for the experience you desire, just wait for a sale on this. This game goes on sale often, so you should be able to grab a copy if you don't already have one. For $1, I would reccomend this game as a cheap multiplayer alternative. However, if you want games with higher player counts, or playing with different people, I would not reccomend this game. Most likely with this game, you'll be playing mostly the same people, over and over again, with some newcomers inbetween. Overall, depends on your patience, whether you want to play with the literal same people only, and if you desire higher server counts.(I'm biased from previous experiences, so I still give this game a reccomendation.)"

,Recommended,263060,18945461,"Posted: 7 November, 2015",all,MichaelPCgamer,"This game runs very smooth.  Unlike other modern FPS games, which run poorly on my PC, this game runs well when all graphics and resolutions are at absolute lowest.  Which means turning EVERYTHING low and off.The gameplay itself is similar to Counter Strike and Warface and many other vs games that include capture the flag, team deathmatch, and storm-like games.  Despite the graphics not looking real (more like minecraft), the game still looks good and the gameplay is smooth and interesting.One of the things this game may need, in the future, is a single-player campaign.  Like Counter Strike and Warface, which will have a campaign, this game needs one to expand its gameplay.Like someone else said in their review, there needs to be a way to allow two or more players to collaborate their ideas into one map or gun to lower time spent and to make the map or gun out of two or more different ideas.The guns in this game need work.  Just because you can customize your weapon, doesn't mean they WORK differently.  There need to be more gun types and accessories added, especially on the sniper rifles.This is one of the few games that I know of where you can literally destroy the entire map.  With a team of about 10 - 12 compliant players, you COULD destroy the entire map and allow for NO room for spawning.I recomend this game to anyone who is into regular casual FPS games like minecraft with guns.  The servers can also be reached from different places such as at home, outside in internet providable places, and even at school.  This is important because I used to mainly play this game at school to pass by time.  I give this game 4.5 stars."

Sniping can be fun if you can get used to the drunk goggles simulator they have for the scope. Shotguns are typically one hit kills and are Ideal for close range, they're not heavy allowing you to move more quickly. Funny thing is 75% of the maps are more or less close range fighting leaving little choice to do else. The assault rifle is ehh ok for close range but better for mid range. The other guns are simply ok with ice skating type aiming.The game is more or less a kill fest for veterans, if you quit to get away from the massacre then you're a rage quitter. No win situation. It can be fun at times if the teams are ballanced, but most of the time it simply feels like an inconvenience."

Blockstorm uses the Unity engine, which is known to be a very well-known engine and many of the games we know and love have been built using the same engine Blockstorm uses. Don't forget that the Unity engine allows the devs to create ports for their games so I expect Blockstorm to expand onto Mac OSX and Linux in the near future.CON'S:Lack of people playing. I know this isn't the game's fault for this as you can see throughout my review, but the game has a few number of people playing everyday, peaking at around maybe 20 people online playing the game. Here's theofficial charts.Overall, Blockstorm is an simple, yet fun to play game and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good shooter.My advice if you enjoy the game, spread the word across your friends, our community we have here as Steam, tell them that this game is a well-done and a enjoyable game, this amazing game needs to be heard across the whole internet so we have more people playing and enjoying this.Thank you for reading, I hope my efforts will improve upon the game."

This game easily gives you a creative outlet, which makes the game so much more personally AND conceptually. Instead of buying $14.99 DLC for a few new maps for your AAA titles, you can find a new server that is hosting brand-new community created and free maps that are incredibly fun. The diversity and variety between the maps creates more memorable and fun moments than you would even hope to experience in games like CounterStrike, or Call of Duty.The ability to create your own character from the very pixel, allows anyone who desires it to express themselves in anyway they want. There are no limits, or restrictions to your creativity. You don't just have a few different generic military themed outfits to pick like Call of Duty or a few character models like CS:Source, And if we haven't learned anything, it's that You, the player, loves customization. Why else do you buy camos off the market or aim for the head as much as you do in Call of Duty?The game is currently in early access, and is only going to get better. This game needs a lot of support, and needs to be brought out of the dark. The potential is amazing and it is a shame that more people aren't playing this game.

Destruction is something that is far underused in video games today. I can safely say that Block Storm does destruction justice. Walls will explode and crumble as you fire upon them. Buildings will fall to the ground if there is no support. The map becomes a wasteland by the end of the match. The gun-play in this game is executed very well. Players are not difficult to see or shoot on the battlefield because the models of the players in-game are the perfect blend of block and realism. Overall, Blockstorm is a breath of fresh air in the FPS genre.RATING - 4.5/5"

If you're like me, you've probably played several of these Early Access/Beta games and have been burned a few times by lack of content and general poor quality. Some I like (Prison Architect, Project Zomboid, Space Engineers), others I've quickly forgotten about. This is a game that makes the former list and will continue to recieve my support.For some background, you shold familiarize yourself with a couple of other games- Minecraft (everyone knows of); Silent Storm (A tactical 3rd person RTS that has a fully destructable environemnt); The Battlefield games; King Arthur's Gold.This game combines elements of each of those previous games and does most of it better than similar titles.The resolution: It's a higher quality than Minecraft and in general, the graphics are a better quality than most Voxel games like it. If you blow up a block, for instance, the block explodes into dozens of smaller ones, that each obey the laws of physics. This lends itself nicely to a realistic feel in a gunfight, as the terrain and environment turn to rubble and dust around you!Physics: Structures actually obey the laws of physics (mostly); if you blow up the base of a freestanding object, the rest crumbles (In the style of a 3d King Arthur's Gold).The Editors: This is where the game really shines! Look at the artwork the community has done in regards to characters. There are so many small details you can edit, you can let your imagination run wild!The map editor is also very detailed, allowing you to create huge structures, or vast fields. Were you a kid that liked playing with Legos and then destroying your masterpieces with as much ingenuity as you were legally allowed? That's the map editor in a nutshell :)You can then take these creations and share them online with other players in game, or via the forums. Which brings me to....Community: Small but active. Devs and Admins regularly interact on the forums, answering questions and giving feedback. You get the sense that they really are relying on the players to help them shape the game... unlike soooooo many other games on this Steam list.And then we get to the bad...Population: Is depressingly low. I've yet to see more than 10 people on a server. However, when you combine this with all of the above and the Early Access state of the game, there really isn't much you can complain about. IN some cases, playing may even become secondary to creating maps and characters!"

The map editor is quite powerful with the ability to easily lay down long linesof blocks at a time it's a breeze to build the biggest structures. I've made maps in 2 to 3 hours time whichhave plenty of content and play well. There really is nothing more satisfying  than making your own mapthen loading it onto the servers to play with other BlockStormers. If you like FPS games you'lllike this one alot."

Hacking isn't as serious as something like depression.""New review: 2/22/2015This game is a lot of fun to play.There are a few problems though. One is the teamkilling mechanism - you are sure to die to your teammates at least 2 or 3 times a match, thanks to all of the explosions. And if you accidentally kill your teammates 3 times in a game, they can vote to kick you. (which actually happens a lot)Two: the moderators and developers use permanent bans. And if you disagree with their policies, they will lock or delete threads. I took snapshots of the relevant posts with Archive.today, in case they delete the threads. Moderators and developers speak down to all players on the forum with a condescending tone. The best you can do is hope the moderators and developers leave you alone. To that effect, I recommend that you do not join the Blockstorm forums.Page 1:https://archive.today/F7eITPage 2:https://archive.today/Bk8xpPage 3:https://archive.today/xUqqYPage 4:https://archive.today/A2ps3Page 5:https://archive.today/1IoS6Page 6:https://archive.today/Fc3vPModerators threaten to delete another thread regarding ban policy:https://archive.today/HdY8cUpdate 2/24/2015: When accused by the community of cheating, the moderators assume you are guilty until proven innocent. Note that most modern justice systems assume you are innocent until proven guilty - therefore, Blockstorm has a medieval moderating system.Here are the statements by Keys of the Eighth Dawn, one of the game's server moderators, in the forum chat box, proving that Blockstorm uses a ""guilty until proven innocent"" medieval justice system:koted: Oh, and btw, Noubexxx received a temp ban.koted: Three days.koted: Yeah, but if he does it again, it will be doubled.koted: But as told him, the community thinks he cheats. So until he proves otherwise, he cheats, period.And here is a forum discussion in which players accuse Noubexxx of cheating, with no concrete evidence:https://archive.today/TVlbWIn medieval justice systems, the accused were often tortured without a trial, and had to undergo an ""ordeal"" to prove their innocence to their community. The same system is used in Blockstorm, where the player is presumed guilty, may be banned without a trial, and must similarly prove their innocence.http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/medieval_law_and_order.htmSee also: ""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WJXHY2OXGEKeys of the Eighth Dawn, a staff moderator, claims to support free speech, but locks threads in the forums to silence debate:https://archive.today/lqXY7""Ok, I'm locking it""https://archive.today/V1pMGUpdate 3/2/2015: Good news! A player who had been previously banned with no evidence, has now been unbanned, pending concrete evidence of cheating.The bad news: on page 2, another player requests that a moderator lock a thread, to halt further free speech or debate.https://archive.today/YoGEYhttps://archive.today/BTlhHUpdate 3/2/2015:They did lock the thread on page 2.https://archive.today/DOAtiUpdate 3/2/2015:The moderators have turned 180 degrees. They have now decided that cheaters are rare, due to the anti cheat system, and changed the policy to require concrete evidence before a player can be banned for cheating. In particular, Noubexxx has been found innocent of cheating, even after he was already punished with a 3 day ban.https://archive.today/90B1aUpdate 3/5/2015:A Blockstorm moderator wrote a reply to this review... and unsurprisingly, they immediately locked the thread, so no one can reply! Brilliant. :)https://archive.today/KzZPcUpdate 3/6/2015:Blockstorm moderator Exenoxx comments below that Noubexx was banned automatically by players for being rude, rather than banned by a moderator for cheating. If that's true, why did Keys of the Eighth Dawn list Noubexx on this Blockstorm forum page as banned for ""Cheating: aimbot, no recoil;"" ?https://archive.today/2IeYz#selection-625.2-408.146Update 3/7/2015:Blockstorm moderator Exenoxx unlocked one of the threads. Exenoxx claims players are ""targetting"" the moderators. So I guess a review on the way moderators and developers treat players is ""targetting"" them? I guess free speech must be a lot worse than insulting players, accusing players, banning players without evidence, and locking threads.https://archive.today/EgNWTUpdate 4/24/2015:A Blockstorm player wrote a very thoughtful argument against the ""report players"" forum, and how it could lead to cyberbullying.https://archive.is/Bxr2oA gem in the post above:""Players don't need to be publicly criticized and harassed because of their unthoughtful behaviour, no matter how bad it is. Hacking isn't as serious as something like depression.""Update to review on 10/20/2015:I was banned from the community forums for joking that this game is dead. It's funny how touchy the moderators are. But I think it has an element of truth, now that I think about it. Lately, when I log in to play this game, all the servers are empty. (and there are over 20 servers!) There are only about 6 hours a day where a server fills above 5 players. Not only that, but since the game is multiplayer only, you can't really play when no one else is online. If you want to play this game, you need to be willing to schedule your time around when other people are online. Average number of players online at any given time is less than 10 - so the elite players end up just dominating the small match sizes. And, of course, if you dare to mention that the game has very few players online, you can expect a ban. After all, if you tell other people there aren't many players, they might not buy the game, and the creators will make even less money than they are making now, selling so few copies.Update to review on 10/24/2015:From the chatango on the Blockstorm website:1: I was totally for Pro's temp ban and not perma and got called an alt-account as well2: haha2: pro soldier must be very entreprenurial2: plot twist: we are both actually pro soldier, and he's schizophrenic1: :o2: :O loominati confirmUpdate to review on 10/25/2015:Supposedly I was banned from Blockstorm's Steam discussions for ""necroposting."" I just looked at the posts in question. The oldest ""dead"" thread was only 2 weeks old, which is still relatively recent given Blockstorm's community size, and the second oldest was only 3 days old. The real reason they banned me was because they didn't like my opinions on those topics - namely, for criticizing the game's activity, and criticizing the clans (such as the administrator clan UNIT). Also, they could have warned me before banning. This is exactly the overly harsh moderation I was talking about in my review, and I will continue to criticize you, your game, and your moderators, regardless of how many times you ban me or censor me.I'm surprised they only banned me for 7 days to be honest - in the past, they would lock threads permanently if I expressed unpopular opinions. We will see what happens if I criticize Blockstorm or the moderators again when my ban expires.Once again, I'll point out I was banned not for cussing someone out, or for calling someone names, but because I said clans are stupid, and that the game has low activity compared to other FPSes. My ban is censorship, plain and simple.Update to review on 10/26/2015:Exenoxx recently claimed via chat that ""we are not like that anymore"" and their policies have changed. However, someone recently contacted me over Steam to say they have been banned from the game permanently, starting a few months ago.I implore the reader to draw his or her own conclusions."

,Recommended,263060,17244646,"Posted: 26 July, 2015",all,Finnbro,"I recently picked up this game on sale, and I have to say that it is one of the best value purchases I've ever made on Steam.  I highly enjoy both Minecraft and CS:GO, so it is a natural fit.  I find the actual gun combat to be only so-so; it seems some guns are more usable than others and the motion isn't exactly fluid, but overall it is fun and adequate given the other stellar features of this game.The customization options in this game are what truly won me over.  The Steam Workshop already has TONS of custom skins for characters, guns, melee weapons, tools, and NPC skins, along with custom maps and an in-depth map editor somewhat similar to Minecraft.  The character and gun customization tools are wonderfully in-depth and easy to pick up.  I made a few of my own custom guns and had a blast doing so, considering you can change both the shape and colors of the guns to fit your look.The built-in maps are solid, and if you enjoy Minecraft resource packs there's a lot of really nice scenery and building inspiration in this game.  Obviously you can make your own maps, and host your own servers with those maps, which I find to be really cool.  Some maps are designed just for singleplayer or co-op with NPC and item placements.  The scenarios that you can create in this game have the potential to be fairly interesting once you get a grasp of the mechanics.Overall, this is a really solid bang for your buck title.  Even at the regular price it's a great value purchase.  There are a lot of Minecraft wannabe games out there, but this one really deserves a look if you're a First Person Shooter fan.  Since its a new game, there may be updates to hope for in the future, but it's already a very enjoyable experience in its current state."

You will need some time spent in-game if you want to get good at the game,it's not a ""be-a-pro-in-two-minutes"" game.EDIT 1:The game's still good,but beware,there are Counter Strike players all over the place.ORIGINAL:FIRST! The game's good,well put together,but it's the people in-game that'll tick you off. The people who use only ONE weapon either the A:AK-47 or B:the sniper rifle(p.s. they will also usually have very small hit boxes due to their super-skinny playermodels that are painted to be camouflaged to the local scenery).SECOND!This game was meant more to be played with friends in my opinion. Go against other people whom you don't know,and you'll get owned.THIRD! Now,the creativity for game content is nothing short of awesome. Some of the weapons skins are VERY well made,as are the player models playermodels. Why didn't I say anything about Maps? Because I have not had the pleasure of exploring the maps,sorry. (P.S. There are a LOT of people,however,who have gun skins that don't look like gun skins. No joke. The skins look like neon lights,or that they're made out of candy.....since when in the history of weapons has an AK EVER looked like it was made out of candy?)I have submitted a few workshop items myself,I tried to keep them as either A:accurate as possible to the actual spectacle,or B:look as awesome as possible without looking fake.Rage section: When you join a server and it's you vs. two other people,it's no longer a battle...it's your massacre. Never before have I hated CTF so much. The first time,it made sense,I was up against a Level 90& some other double-digit....then it got embarrassing. Two level 1's....I lost to two level ones...ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!"

Some weapons are more powerful than others, but can be taken out tactically. More skill is needed to play this game, in my opinion. The enviornment is destructable aswell, creating some interesting scenes and gravity does take role.CustomizingMost of my time in this game was in trying to make interesting weapon skins, which didn't upload properly to the workshop. Why? I don't know, but most didn't. Still, you can completely customize the weapon, minus the fact you have a limited workspace and can only remove certaint blocks. These blocks are the inner-gun, which, logically, shouldn't be removed. Characters can also be created, aswell as NPCs and tools. Maps can also be created for this game.WorkshopIf you can't seem to get into making your own stuff, or if you just don't feel like your doing well at it, the workshop is always here. Plenty of people upload characters, weapons, tools. NPCs, and more onto the workshop for this game that they have created.OverallI would give this game a 85/100 (8.5/10), mainly due to the fact I found the multiplayer to be semi-interesting. The multiplayer was fun here and there, but I kept losing my interest."

Content is constantly flowing into the game, so there is no repetetive maps or gameplay, but the controls are not as responsive as they could be.Overall I do recommend this game, because a larger community will help to improve the game to a point where I have nothing to complain about anymore."

The controls feel floaty, I can never seem to tell where I'm aiming due to both lag and the controls, and everything just feels so small.Looking at what Blockstorm is currently, I would wait to buy this on sale if I wanted it.

I timed its installing time and it took 3 min  and 2 seconds. I opened the game and didn't do the first time install thing (yea im cool like that). Then the games main menu started and it was meh. BUT THEN IT ZOOMED OUT AND THIS KICK @SS MUSIC STARTED PLAYING. it was like DUNDUNDUNDUNDUNDUNDUNDNDUNDDN. 9/12 soundtrack. I was like awweaewaeawhelllllllllllllyeah. So i went to settings to do the video junk that we all do when we open a game. There was like nothing to change. 1/4 setting options. I go into the ""quick play"" section. And it put me in a queue. It didn't find a game. I was waiting for like 5 min. 0/1 on quickplay (not quick). So I go into the regular play thing.

,Not Recommended,263060,29059427,Posted: 6 January,all,TheDragonReborn,Kind of like Ace of Spades.People cheat and do the instant aim sniper shots which is fun but youll see some other stuff like short range teleports when they are about to get meleed or throwing grenades across half a map length..The Block Look Exploit that used to be in Ace of Spades is present in this game (where you can aim and shoot through blocks) and people abuse it.People can glitch grenades and claymores to not take damagePretty sure theres a speed exploit too where you can run as fast as Sonic but only while using the lightest build (shotgun)Using the Sniper is slipperyThe Shotgun is useful at long ranges (legitimate WTF on this one where you can snipe people to death)Melee feels slowEnviroment gets destroyed way too easily reulting in teams griefing their own bases or destroying the countryside with C4Its fun just for the creation stuff but be warned about the cancer.Not sure I can recommend it with so few people outside of the 40-50 in Europe actually playing it.

The weapons are extremely unbalanced, the pistol getting no love, needing about 20 shots for a single kill, while the rifle, sniper rifle, and shotgun all have an instant kill on close-mid range. luckily, the shotgun isnt distance, but OH BOY, here comes the AK-47.Blockstrom Devs, why? why must you include such bulls**t in your voxel shooter? I swear, the distance on the AK is infinate, the ammount of times i've been hit across the map due to sheer spray n' pray in my direction baffles me. The community on this game is garbage.Little to no active servers, and player skins so horrible you'd want to gouge your eyes out. Oh! get this, they included FALL DAMAGE in their voxel shooter!""Yeah, So? Isn't that a feature in all modern shooters?"" you might askYEAH! IT CERTAINLY IS! What I'm complaining about is the fact that you can't drop 10 blocks without dying.Another question I have, is why does the sniper scope feel like im ICE SKATING WITH MY MOUSE? I drag slightly and it drifts off past my target, and turns at the SLOWEST POSSIBLE PACE.The placement of ""Special weapons"" are complete bulls**t. Mechs, RPGS, Tripmines. they need to be limited or at least delay the item's respawn rate.Finally, the ""Weight"" system... Please. Please stop trying to make this work. Just have everyine move at the same speed and add a sprint button... I'm so tired of seeing a grenade and not being able to get away in time because my character is carrying lead in their backpack.overall, this game is fun, but it can get extremely frustrating on populated servers or flat-areas/trench-warfare type situations. Please. fix this game. I want to like it, I want to believe, I want to play a good game."

It's like a nice more advanced version of Ace of Spades in my opinion. Gameplay is simple. Run, shoot, hide, build. It's not very fast paced. It's fairly relaxed and there is no singleplayer with AI etc.The amount of weapons you have to choose from is alright. Nothing really fancy. But the weapons do their job. I'd say there is room for more unique weapons though if the developer is interested in adding more ""out there"" kind of weapons.I'd say despite this being an early access game. It is looking fairly polished with the content so far. There aren't many gamemodes as of yet. But there are apparently more coming soon.I do not know the plans for the game once it's finished (this is an early access review) But I do feel this game lacks in content that could increase fun in gameplay. Be it an improvement to the way the world/maps are affected by the player(s), maybe a singleplayer with monsters or something with little singleplayer missions (nothing fancy mind you, or perhaps some more unique weapons/items. But most important, I'd enjoy it more if there was a sprinting ability and being able to prone. Not just crouch.Now, onto the verdect.Do I recommend this game?My answer is if you love(d) Ace of Spades and similar games. Then I'd say this game may just be something you'll enjoy. So yes. I'd recommend it.Is it worth it's price of $12 right now?I'd say it just meets my requirements for a yes at this point.All in all. A nice little game. If you're unsure whether to get it. I would suggest watching some gameplay videos first before purchasing."

It revolves around this editor, thing, which can be used to create your character, create a level, and you can make ANYTHING. Minecraft revolves around crafting, mining, and some combat. This revolves around combt, creativity, adrenaline, and excitement. In Call of Duty, you could run around and shoot people, but you could not create your character from the skeleton out. in this, you can. you can make a fat man, thin man, short man, tall man, disfigured man, AND you can base your characters off of other characters. While playing earlier, i saw a guy running buy with a Finn the Human model from Adventure Time. And then, i saw a guy who's model was Patrick, from SpongeBob SquarePants.The possibilities are quite endless. I STRONGLY recommend that you purchase Blockstorm. The graphics are AMAZING, if you are pondering that. The graphics, shading, textures, movements, weapons, and editors are not like your typical ""Minecraft with guns indie game"" they are, in fact, Call of Duty level graphics, in cubic form. But, one of my favorite features of the game, is that the world is destructible. You can shoot blocks to destroy them. Pretty fantastic, if I do say so myself.

Also sniper rifles have insane sway while aiming and they feel like you're sliding them across ice when turning while aiming; you know how they feel in CoD Black Ops 1? Well multiply that by about 15 and you have Blockstorm sniper rifles.Yet another flaw this game has is the sheer quantity of hacking Russians. Sure, every game has them, but in the 1.2 hours I've logged as of the time of writing this review I guarantee I've been one-shotted cross-map by a shotgun wielding ""негроидный"" at least 30 times. You can't just avoid them, go to EU servers, go to NA servers, go to Asia servers, they're just as prominent in all of these places.The game is still fun though, and I would say it's worth it at full price, on sale for $0.99 it's a steal.This game would be worthy of a $20 price tag and be a 9/10 game if they would fix these glaring problems, but as it stands Blockstorm is a solid 7/10."

There are very little guns! after about 2 hours you have basically mastered all of them. There are however a TON of maps, you might have to play about 15-20 hours to play them all. I really dont like the editor system, it has very clunky camera control and offers no tutorial, took me way too long to figure out. BEWARE: Even though the devs still update its sort of rare, they are close to abandoning it, people still play it though and it has an active community. Mostly fun but has some bad moments. 7.5/10 (At its current price it is worth it but I reccomend buying it on sale like I did for $1"

Although it's a generic FPS, it's more unique. It even has a pretty good physics system. Take out enough blocks of a certain structure, and it'll fall. The Workshop and customization is AWESOME. Weapons can have their entire appearance changed due to skins. In order to create a skin, you need to use the editor, which is pretty fun itself. You can also download new characters, which means I found myself having LOTS of Star Wars characters.

,Recommended,263060,20210280,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,MrExzibit,"Recommended17.6 hrs on recordDescriptionBlockstorm is a blocky and cartoony FPS game with a wide variety of maps, gamemodes, guns and other awesome features. The game is great with fantastic workshop creations made everyday. This game comes with a map editor and a weapon customizer which allows you to create your own very personal beasty looking gun, or if you're feeling lazy to make a weapon. You can pick and download from the thousands of already created weapon skins in the workshop so you can show off in battles! There's also a character creation tool fitted within the game so you're able to upload your character to the workshop! This means you are aloud full customization. So if you want to be a Pope with a giant pink RPG then you can sure as hell do that! Also, almost EVERYTHING is destroyable.What I think of the game?So Blockstorm is a fun game you can't say it isn't. However the thing wrong with it is, it's very repetative. It's missing something that adds something interesting to the game. So far it's just spawn in, kill, die respawn that's it. There's no leveling, upgrading, unlocking at all which is quite sad. It would make the game more interesting and would give the player something to work towards. The only time when you are going to have fun and ignore that the game is lacking fun features is when you play with 3 or more friends. That's when things get highly enjoyable and worth playing.PriceIn my opinion the price is perfect for what this game has to offer. It's not much. So if you and your buds have $5 in your bank/steam wallet and are looking for a fun game to hang out in. I will recommend this game. There's a huge amount of maps which you're able to download to have even more fun in.Pros- Great workshop (you can download custom character models/weapon skins)- Character, weapon editor and map editor.- Slightly competative when playing with a large group of friends.- Fun weapons.Cons- If you host your friends will have 150 to 300 ping playing.- Gets repetative after a while. (no leveling/unlockables meaning nothing to play towards)- Difficult character model editing (might want to check some tutorial vids on youtube towards that.)Personal Recommendation1. Must get.2. Recommended purchase3. Recommended purchase during sale.4. Not recommended unless heavily discounted.5. Not recommended."

Youre going to be playing with them or not playing.Hackers. Yes there are sadly cheats for this game. You will occasionally run into ESP and Aim Bot users as well as cheats with the ability to pop any breakable block in 1 shot.LAAAAAAG. This is one of those games that lets lag run wild. Players will appear to teleport and have insane speed bursts while still being able to accuarately mow you down. Lets not forget dying a full second after taking cover.Permitted Abuse. The games customization is nice as stated but players will very commonly abuse it to make stick thin characters the color of the background.No tools. The game is missing very common shooter tools such as vote kick... Many youre stuck on a single server with the above and you can't leave(if you want to play) or get rid of them.It's almost a good game but it's weighted down by soooo much bullsh*t.Pass.

They have previously released a racing game calledGoscurryfor PC and a puzzle game calledJelly All Starsfor iOS mobile devices.Blockstormwas published by IndieGala, a company that always gives us the best indie games at great prices.Gameplay.What is the basic formula behindBlockStorm? It’s simple, grab the blocky characters fromMinecraftand give them high caliber guns and explosives to shoot each other in highly moddable and destructable environments. Almost everything in this game is highly customizable: the characters and especially the maps. There are several game modes, including but not limited to Classic Deatmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag and others.The controls are the classic FPS. It plays out similarly to old school arcade deathmatch FPS games likeQuakeorUnrealrather than to modern military shooters such asBattlefieldandCall Of Duty. There is no 360noscope or other shenanigans that requires superhuman abilities. Just regular running, shooting and jumping. And occasionally blowing up stuff. There is a sizable quantity of weapons to choose, ranging from pistols and submachineguns to semi-automatic rifles, assault rifles, light machineguns and rocket launchers.The weapons are horrible. Unbalanced. Currently, there are only RPG, LMG, MP5, AK, UZI, shotgun, sniper, rifle and handguns in which all of these have horrible sound effect and it makes you feel like you're using a card board gun made in China. The sniper and rocket launcher are useless. If your gun is automatic you win. The only populated servers are the ""DEMO"" servers witch feature only 4 maps. Map/Player skin creation is the only decent thing is this game.Character actions are basic and you are only limited to aim-shoot, run, crounch and jump. No sprinting, diving, or lying on the ground. If you want to playSuper Marioin 3D, this game is for you.Basically,Blockstormis a voxel FPS that has a wonderful system but with poor gameplay quality. Good concept but lack of polishing. I understand that the game community is not big yet and the devs do not have a large income from this game, but this is my honest impression of this game at its current state.Positive points. (+)Minecraftstyle with FPS.Customization.Very indepth character/weapon editor.Negative points. (-)No ingame tutorial on how things work/straight into gameplay.Unbalanced weapons.Matchmaking system could be better.The game don't have many players on the servers.Toxic playerbase (if the game is going to be an online only FPS, then someones experience with the game can be quite easily ruined when half of the current server they are on are spouting racial slurs and derogatory terms for certain groups)."

The only thing i found appealing about this game was the abillity to create and share your own weapons to the workshop although I still didnt understand a single thing on how to build/edit my own weapons.Overall i wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has played any fps ever.but.. if this is your first fps then I recommend that you try somthing else that will probably play much better than walking around and getting killed"

The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-Symoné guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others."

Some balancing to the weapons would help. The game is just mediocre and that's why the community is so small. If it could be changed to stand out more  people might buy it.

The idea is great and it's VERY enjoyable to be able to make your own skins for yourself and your weapons. That alone makes the money I spent worth it.There are plenty of game modes to choose from that all feel different. Every game mode has a different objective or approach to it and it actually is really enjoyable to bounce around to different modes.Con:Unless I'm crazy, the servers are very empty a lot of the time. Only 1 or 2 in any given timezone has players-even though there's like 5 or 6 servers total to choose from, and usually only one of those two is close to being full I've found.The sound design is horrible. You don't hear gunshots unless you're RIGHT UP NEXT TO THE PERSON THAT'S SHOOTING. The only time you ever hear a gun being shot at you is a slight ""whiff"" when bullets are close to you that's very quiet. In fact, a lot of the sounds are very quiet or nonexistent. Footsteps, damage sounds; the sound design in general just doesn't seem very well contrived at all.Verdict:At this point in time I can't in good conscience recommend the game. It's FUN, but rather empty and home to some pretty annoying design choices. Particularly regarding sound. 5/10"

Nothing makes sense when you get killed by silent entities from across the map because the sound doesn't travel well enough. You don't even hear bullets hitting you half the time. Much less does anything explain the collision when digging trenches I got stuck at least 5 times in the same trench because my feet kept getting stuck or something. Stuff you shouldn't be able to dig through, you can dig through. Stuff you shouldn't be able to break, breaks.This game is 1-2 hit kills. Guns are bulky and don't shoot straight, even at close range, much less seldom aided by its ironsights feature. There are very few sound cues so you can only rely on your health bar to tell if you're taking damage. Zombies poke you to death.This game feels VERY unfinished. Its as if they had literally taken Ace of Spades, increased the model resolution of players. The guns don't shoot where you aim, there's little to tell if you're doing damage other than a thin bar above your target, and nothing makes sense.This feels like a beta. Not a all worth 5 dollars. I'd pay 99 cents for it because thats about all the enjoyment I got out of it, most of that $5 probably goes towards coding those editors. The editors and character/weapon/world customization are the only things they did right; its a shame its all to waste because the gameplay is nothing like you'd expect."

,Not Recommended,263060,16842924,"Posted: 2 July, 2015",all,KardaKAX,"TL;DR at the bottom.Now, saying a game is bad and that I, personally, wouldn't reccomend it is two different things that people often get mixed up about.I don't have any major complaints about the game other than how it introduces new players.I mean, the gameplay is smooth, the animations are good (for what is there) and the fact that they have implemented an in-game skin customiser that has workshop compatability is something that more games need to be doing. The voxel system is something I loved since I first played Ace of Spades on one of the free weekends.However, I just can't understand how the game works.I understand the premess of the game with it's objective systems yet I have no idea how the gun play works, of which many games at least show you a tutorial of this. Sure, I can look this up from other users yet I do fee the game should have some responsability in that department.Also, I found that the choises for arnaments are very restricting. There were your base weapons (ARs, Shotguns, LMGs etc.) but that was it, really. I don't feel like I have as much freedom as some other games, which, as a user, I need to have to stay interested in the game. These also, to me, feel and move very clunky as well as the contraction time on crosshair. I personally think a few tweaks may be needed to make the guns feel like guns and not a lucile bat that sparks out bullets.The maps that I play in the quick-join seem to be very small, restricting and quite dull. Now, I don't have enough experince to see how it works propperly, yet, if these are the maps the devs have made, I don't think a tiny 3-room map with a few corridors is enough for a CTF, maybe a DM or a small TDM.TL;DR: I don't like the game for the gunplay, maps and how hard it is to get into, yet I do find the premess of the voxels and skin customisation very nice. It's a decent game, but, I can't say I like it."

76561198055406889,Not Recommended,263060,13764292,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,SodOffShogun,"I will just begin with the positive side of this game.I do like some of the mechanics in this game, it might just be a personal preference however I find them as something that makes this game ever so slightly more challenging than just a click of the mouse, for example the sniper's scope sways slightly as you zoom in which I think makes it more challenging that just scoping in and just gunning everybody down. So It's nice to know that something is keeping the sniper rifle from being Over-Powered.Another substantially nice part about this game is the editors. Just to give a run-down of the editors you are allowed to edit and design your own in-game characters as well as maps to play on with your friends which I think is neat. You could say like it is an ever changing battlefield.Now for the negative side of thingsAs of writing this review I lost a good friend  of mine, Pro-Soldier. He was banned unreasonably and without a reason at the least which upset me very much. I don't know if this is just people disliking him for being the highest leveled person on the game or it just being some act that was so non-benevolent. I've asked multiple times to members of the UNiT clan whom of which contains a few moderators from my knowledge why Pro was banned and I have received no response since then, I don't know if they did not want to confront the issue, talk about it, or just plain were being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s though each one has the same possibility as the other.Hackers or at least exploiters; there are few however, the ones that do exist within the game do make it a pain. I'll say I've come across some people who somehow (I dont even know how) manage to spam the RPG and what I mean by that is that the can continuously launch Rockets non-stop, or at least in rapid succession. From what I know the RPG only has 1 Rocket that comes with it, so too see somebody not get a kill and pick up that persons backpack and launch a second RPG is very displeasing. Nonetheless I wouldnt say its the most major issue because you can typically just snipe them from across the map if you are good enough.I've personally come across a few bugs that I've tried addressing before but have been dismissed. One that I discovered is one where if you are underground in a tunnel lets say, if you place down a claymore or C4 and walk over it you clip through the ground and can see where every player is. I think this is just a simple bug that needs to be fixed  but It does get annoying seeing some people exploit this which becomes a pain in the @$$ when you are trying to have a legitimate game.Overall the community is alright. This isn't nescessarily a positive or negative but rather just an observation.Personally its not a suprise to me that from a Romance speaking and mediterranean country to expect a product like this where there is not industry about it.  Ubisoft however is a French games company, France is a Romance speaking and some what a meditteranean country, though France is different, France is situated and bordered around Germanic/Germanic language speaking countries where their economies are stronger. This is where the French get their influence from and out paces other Romance and mediterranean speaking countries i.e. Spain and Italy where there the most southern of all European countries and do not have an history in technical industry like producing video games even though in the past it seems to differ so.Nonetheless I have to sadly downvote this game for a few reasons but In some ways the game is entertaining and if this review is too long for you then buy the game!.69/10"

I'm not sure how I hadn't heard of other similar games such as ace of spades, but this was the first i'd seen. The game is lacking currently. It is solely a multiplayer shooter, and I feel as though the game should include other modes. A survival mode would be one example, possibly a co-op or single player mode. However, I am forced to join the only open server of 4 people. I cannot blame the devs for a lack of players, however without them, the game is essentially useless."

Not too serious, But not too twitch-shootery either. Features and gamemodes are still being added, And game rooms tend to be empty unless you join around your area's Prime times or before school hours.As I write this, There's CTF, DeathMatch, Team DeathMatch, Assault modes. Assault plays a bit like some form of land grab where the defending team must prevent the attacking team from occupying a specific zone or more for a certain amount of time.The controls and interfaces for the game itself and it's various editors were a little different at first, But with a little learning and some wikis I found htem extremely intuitive for working with Voxels, And the editor for making your own skins is top-notch. Nothing is more satisfying than making your own, Unique skin or map.Workshop integration launched recently too, And already is filling up with many quality prefabs, Maps and characters. So far for it's time, And the constant work and communication with the developers, This is promising to be the Well-made voxel shooter of the year if more players support this company.Try the demo, Albeit you are limited in weapon map and skin it's a good sample of the fun that can be had in this game.I would rate this 4/5 stars. And that's being picky about some features, But being an early access it could very well change the moment I hit 'POST' on this review..!"

Nice weapons where accuracy and movement are important (instead of Guncraft, weapons are less accurate and need to be mastered, the basic rifle is a bit powerfull but the overall is quite balanced). The system to create characters and levels is great. The maps created by the devs are awesome.When you fight on bridge where everything can be destroyed... you can imagine how good the fights can be.So why I don't recommand this game ?For the players.First: Many players don't care about other countries and speak their language without giving a fu... to others.It' s really nice to be insulted in russian or italian. About italians... if your from this country you will be happy because a lot of guys on the only populated server are italians.Second: An other great thing on the game is the lack of creativity of players. The system to build characters is cool but you will constantly see on games,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥looking characters or (the most common) the basic model (the basic model to build a character, it's a white dummy) which thin as a wire and give to the guy the nice advantage to be really hard to spot and to shoot in the head...Third: An other great thing is the fact that the only server where players are often playing is a server switching with Counter strike maps imported on Blockstorm. And this is really annoying for such a game. When during 4 hours you've circled between 3 maps (Ddust and 2 others) not very interresting and quite uggly... you really start to get bored !Like many other games, blockstorm is a great concept but♥♥♥♥♥. up by its players.This is really sad..."

The only gamemodes available are deathmatch and team deathmatch. There is one other that I forgot the name of.Anyway, they are your generic shooter gamemodes, except THIS time, you have to look at the screen, figure out whether or not someone is an enemy or not, and then shoot.The second part is the hardest, trust me. When I first played, I was shooting at teammates and enemies alike trying to figure who was what. Did no one learn from TF2 how to do it right? Another problem is the awful, AWFUL game balance. The AK47 is the only weapon that stands a chance. Every other weapon is too slow, innacurate or heavy to be worth anything.Skin design (THE ♥♥♥♥ING SELLING POINT!) is limited beyond compare. What's the point of making your own stuff when you can't even make what you want in the first place?  You barely have ANY extra starting room beyond the default skin. You wanna replace that AK's banana mag? Nope, can't do that.You wanna replace the M249's barrel with something better/shorter? Nope, can't do that either.You wanna ♥♥♥♥in' add a scope to the pistol? NOPE. CAN'T DO THAT!The devs are obsessed with gameplay (they aren't doing a very good job at balancing it anyway), and thus are neglecting the other parts of the game that make it stand out from other games. This seems to be a trend with games like Blockstorm or Robocraft. They focus too much on competitive gameplay and neglect the casual players who WANT TO HAVE FUN.A thing I've noticed is that sometimes players will outright use the default skeleton to give themselves an advantage. It's almost impossible to aim at them.Overall rating: 0/10, would refund if possible."

I know, it's not similar at all, because I'm talking about the he cool one (old version, still playable outside Steam), So NO classes, just different weapons you can choose with. And I hope it will stay that way.But... the weapons aren't 100% balanced, gun sounds are... Strange.To be fair, the best thing about this game is the editor. Simple, intuitive and with endless possibilities. If you don't have a creative mind, I can't really suggest this game, because as an fps is still meh for now. But if you do, this game is awesome! I don't think I have ever seen a game that allows so much freedom at customizing you character and your weapons. Other games just allow you to wear different things and change parts from your guns, not build everything from scratch. As someone noticed maaaybe a little too much freedom? I don't really care.

While I suck at creating characters or weapons, I had a fun time ""attempting"" to make them, and the gameplay didn't feel slow or badly scripted. BUT, there are a few things that could make it that bit better.1) Make everything customizable. Unfortunatly, you cannot change how granades, C4, the mine type explosive, and how bullets look.2) Unique Characters. While you can make your characters look different, they all have the same animations. A very small thing, but it would be cool to see changeble animations for jumping, running, Ect.3) More weapons.All in all, you should buy this because there is so much freedom in it."

The weight system keeps gameplay balanced, so you can't have those super powerful guns without being a little heavy, but no matter what loadout I choose, whether I'm a speeder with a shotgun and pistol, or a tank, with a heavy machine gun and an RPG, it's tons of fun shooting and blowing up my enemies, and I've spent tons of time in the player and weapon editor. There's only 6 gamemodes (one of them not even having any servers), yet a lot of them aren't even played. That brings me to my main issue. There's barely anyone playing! Now, you can't really blame the gamemakers for this, but one time I counted up the players on every server on there, and I only found about 26! There's so many empty servers, and it seems all the servers with any players are in Europe, which takes a toll on my ping when I'm living in the U.S. Generally the only gamemodes being played are Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch, with maybe a few players on another. Besides all I've said though, it's an awesome game, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes FPS, sandbox games, or even building games (did I mention you can build stuff with cubes?). 9/10."

You can create and share / play with your own created characters.There is no veichles in this game and i dont really miss them either. Why? The maps created are more like close combat or sniper variations aka old COD UO. The difference is ofcourse the gfx style and that you can destroy almost everything on the maps so never expect to be able to hide for to long. :)The game is created with the community in mind so start creating some cool or funny maps to share. Fun fun fun...I would recommend that you buy a 4 pack and share with your friends for some fun gaming. And lets help this community to grow, the game really deserves it.And sadly a tiny tumbs down:The characters can feel a bit floaty sometimes. Just jump and you will understand. Also a sprint button for quick getaway would be most welcome. The run speed used in current game can be walk speed and run could be done in bursts with energy bar.((Please note the game is still in early process so this can change))And yes the score:GFx 9-10 (Usefull comparisons Minecraft, Guncraft, Murder Miners, Blockland)Sfx 7-10 (its okay and fits the game)Music 6-10 (Not much to say, but it fits where it is)Gameplay 9-10 (SuperEasy creating maps and fun)I will gladly recommend this game because its super fun online.

76561198101966249,Recommended,263060,32442596,Posted: 15 June,all,The Gentleman,"This game is Awesome.I bought this game when it was only $0.89 on steam, but for $2.99 its worth every penny.The game runs very well even on toasters, although, in high populated servers you can generally expect a lower frame rate, though its manageable enough.Secondly, this game gives you complete control over each of your weapons and character models, so if you want to customize it to fit whatever design you have, you can do that. If you have the time, and patience you can a really awesome skin, or really awesome weapon. I've got nearly 20 different skins for my weapons, and more when I feel like it. For what it's worth, its probably one of the best purchases I've made.My main gripes with the game are the melee hit boxes, as I frequently miss people I should have hit, and hit people who I should have missed, although the hitbox is based off the default knife skin, and not so much as whatever skin you have on your weapon. Additionally the damage in the game is very inconsistant, the rifle normally kills people in 1-3 shots(if you hit the head, 3 anywhere but the head, and 2 if the first shot is a body shot and second a head) although there are times when it takes a whole magazine to kill them, and all I get are hit markers. The sniper is also a big concern with the game, as there seems to be a bit of a delay from when you flick your scope onto an enemy and aim to compensate. there will be times when I scope in, over or undershoot my aim, and when I go to move the scope there's about a half to one second delay before you reaim in otherwords, unless you aim right where there at and scope in perfectly, sniping is very hard.Additionally, when you want to make a new weapon from scratch, you can't break it all the way down, you can only break it down to essentially it's skeleton.(the exeption being the knife that you can make it into whatever you want.) this gets infuriating if you have a very clever design but you are limited to game's coding of the skeleton, which is understandable, but this in turn makes you get even more creative about your problem.Overall though, I would still say that this game is worth its price, as you can create just about anything in the game, the only limits are what your own imagination can come up with."

Well here is Blockstorm, a game where you can create your own character bit by bit and then watch as it is torn to shreds by someone with an lmg or rocket launcher. You can also create skins for your weapons and equipment, or if you are too lazy to make your own just download some off the workshop. It gets a good 7.6/10 from me. Its a game I play here, but it currently suffers from not having too many people playing it. This is kinda killing blockstorm off as a game people play because its a multiplayer focused game. There isNOcampaign, pretty sure I'm not the only person who enjoys a good campaign so I thought I should mention that. But if your into being able to customize almost everything in the game, shooting other players, multiple game modes and/or first person pixel games/shooters, this game is for you.Final rating 7.6/10"

You can't customize the stats too, its very blam by me.CHARACTER, its like very hard to create one, from the many parts, even the zombie and turret (i did create some turret models), not gonna go trough everythingMAP, This is what started most of other stuff, parkour like, clan maps, and other stuff, and even remixed and rippoffs i suppose, i did create some maps, its not that hard but creating a map can take 1 hour to 2 days, creating a perfect one with background things can take 4 DAYS TO 1 MONTH or even longer! i created some bad maps but i plan to return and update the maps.The other stuff is left out because of the limit, you can play this game but i see like 3 flaws, i may of made mistakes.55 / 100% for a intermediate experience"
