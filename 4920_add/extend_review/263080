76561198072066077,Not Recommended,263080,10389310,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,Prism,"I bought this game because the video looked cool and most of the reviews were positive. I was expecting a game with customization, progression, and creativity. It failed to meet my expectations in any of these categories.Right off the bat it says that it's an ""action RPG"". I thought this meant all these cool powerups were things I could invest in with things like skill points. No. You just find/buy the powerups and they only last 250 shots. Not much of a point using them except for the 'bosses' which will be discussed later.You do level up and get stat points which is cool... but then again it isn't. All you do with your stat points is put them into damage as you do very little. Attack speed? So my powerups can run out even faster? Very lame options here. Just get damage. Zzz...The armor system is yet another under delivered concept. Cool you get customizable armor? That sounds great. Oh it breaks after 5 or so hits? Well I guess that's fine... Oh it isn't really customizable? You just pick 5 of the same boring stats (damage x 5)? Hmmm but they have unique effects! Could be some cool combinations! No. It only has 5 types, depending on what type of 'orb' you use the most of. They all are just an effect on when you get HIT, something you should never do. And the effects hardly do anything other than cause lag. Miss.Bosses I mentioned before. I've been to 2 before I stopped playing. The FIRST boss. Even if you put ALL of your points into damage and save all of the powerups for this fight it will take a very long time. It is pointless to use the 'mechanics' of the lightning trap as it seems to do nothing. All you do is run around in a circle at the bottom of the map shooting it... and shooting it... and shooting it. It has a ridiculous amount of health and isn't interesting at all. I finally figured out that the only way to hurt it is the fire powerup. Dumb.The 2nd boss isn't much better. Once again it has near infinite health. Boring. Once again it is just a reskinned mob. Boring.The mob types are very repetive as are the environment""s"". ""Act 1 and 2"" were the exact same. The same boring environment and mob types, just more hp and probably damage. Horrible.There were only 2 things that weren't terrible about the game and even then they were just fine and ripoffs of other games.The graphics looked fine. A copy of Geometry wars and Minecraft, but not as well done as either.The narrator was okay. Very similar to Bastion to have an involved narrator but nowhere as good.I regret buying this game. It feels like an alpha or an early access game. Not finished at all and the updates they are planning on adding don't address any of the short comings. Not worth $10, maybe $4. Save your money and get Binding of Isaac if you want a game like this, much better. The large amount of positive reviews I suspect were written by the Devs or their friends/family. I could find no reviews of the game online.Sorry if I was harsh Devs, I do not mean to hurt your feelings but this is a bad game and I feel swindled."

Like the reviewers before me I say that this game could use some work, and it seems that all it's really good for is getting that 5 minute feeling of awesomeness from creating the ultimate pixel spammer. However, this game has more than just that.EffectsHonestly, I HAVE to say that the music is very fitting for the world of Pixel Boy. It makes you feel like you really are in a pixelated world adventuring in dungeons. The narrator is also very funny, throwing great jokes and being quite silly with his netural tone. The world is also quite colorful and many details are put in that you normally wouldn't expect for a $10 game. 9/10StoryThere hardly IS a story in Pixel Boy, as the entire town and dungeon appears as just another punchline. This CAN work out if you do it right, and I really think they did a good job making sure they didn't need one. 8/10GameplayNow here I have an issue. The game itself just feels... empty. As if the developers didn't put it something or got a little lazy. Sure, the dungeon is always randomly generated by randomly arranging rooms, but no matter how you arrange it or whatever value your math textbook says it will add (I know this for myself how tempting it is), you CANNOT cahnge the fact THAT THEY ARE STILL THE SAME ROOMS. The same goes for the enemies. Sure, each level has diffrent mobs, but there are only about 10 or 12 of them. This makes the levels get repetitive after a short time. When Sprial Knights did this, they created HORDES of enemies, easter eggs, and special events. DO IT RIGHT, PEOPLE.  I know the game wanted to focus on the creation of the bullet spammer, the ULTIMATE WEAPON, but the lack of weapon mods limits your creativity more than you'd think. If you're not grinding for your ULTIMATE WEAPON to complete it, you are using it while worrying about AMMO COSTS. Don't listen to those trailers, those people having been playing that game for HOURS AND HOURS on end. It's true that damage is still a little OP. By that I mean it's the MAIN STAT you go for. Armor is completely broken because it's just not worth buying for the lack of creativity it has. All it really does is improve your stats, doing something on HIT (bad ideas are bad) and SAPPING YOUR MONEY THROUGH REPAIR COSTS. Still not worth the coins.  Overall, it feels boring and unnecessary to have such a medicore system.   5/10Overall, if you've played some bullet hell games like Touhou, and you've always wanted to have that kind of ultimate power, get this game. It probably won't be consuming my time like World of Warcraft and Terraira, but it's worth my $10 and definitely has the pontential to become more."

It presents a Minecraft-like environment and it is gorgeous. The powerup combinations are one of the highlights of this game. You can make so many different types of ""pixel-weapons"" and there is enough for every type of player (I personally am not a fan of the ""Spread"" weapon power-up).The only (minor) problem I have with it is the fact that the enemies are also picked at random for each of the levels. I found myself dying to enemies that I clearly could not do anything to protect myself from very early in the game. This was not something that made the game any less enjoyable because the levels themselves (and the power-ups) are all random so it is always a very good experience regardless."

I have been looking for a Twin stick shooter rpg for ages. This almost fills the void.Pros:The controls are solid. The character responds well to commands.The music is pretty fantastic.The graphics, while simple, are pretty well done. I love dem square trees.You can feel pretty powerful._______Cons:The bullets (pixels) are incredibly glowy. After a few levels, it's just about all you can see. But it doesn't matter much because;The game is waaaay too easy. Once you implement resource management and get a few upgraded equips, you neve run out of ammo. Which isn't even a complaint really, I hate ammo hunting, but when I can one shot an entire room and kill the final boss before I get a good look at him, things are a tad too easy.The game is waaaaay too short. I put like 3 hours into it and it's done. Which is unfortunate, because I was a lot of fun,The interface. It's not pretty, and doesn't offer a lot of information about what you're looking at. For example, if you're crafting and you want to know how much ammo one of your equips have, you have to leave the crafting table, open up your inventory, and equip the item. There are no tooltips, except to tell you what each item does (also not available while crafting). Some simple quality of life enhancements would make this game a TON better.Small gripe, the monsters don't die as soon as they take a killing blow, and that can be frustrating. It's like, ok, he's dead, but he still got a hit on you after taking all that damage and oh look, now he explodes._____The Breakdown:I like this game. I really do. I'm also glad I got it on sale, because at it's current state, I would have felt a tad dissapointed. I DID have fun with it, and I think a lot of people will, but it just doesnt feel complete.The BrightSide:The developer is being very active. There have already been a few updates that introduce new features, with more on the way. So if you can bare with it through some of it's growing pains, then I would say it's an absolute buy. Now get out there and shoot some pixels!Gaming on Ubuntu 14.04. Pixel Boy runs great on it."

The controls are super responsive, which is important because♥♥♥♥♥♥get hectic when you start getting to some of the lower levels. As is the case with most good rouge-likes, the randomly generated nature of the levels means that no two runs are the same. The thing that really sets this game apart though, is the powerup and crafting system. The devs claim there are over 6000 different weapon combinations, and I can believe it. Once you start stacking split and spread shots the game starts looking like a bullet hell shmup that even puts Ikaruga to shame. Top it off with a great soundtrack, and you have a game that pumps blood to my nether regions faster than a topless Daenerys Targaryen."

In some of the dungeons you end up with the easy enemies while in others you have the toughest. But like the narrartor says, you can't just focus on one skill. if you focus on range you can kill from a far but it would take a while since you dont have good damage or rate of fire, then you have too much damage and you have to get close for a shot or two, basically, you have you have it balanced. it does get crazier and crazier but that makes it fun! although i will admit i raged alot about the enemies ending up surrounding you while you can only focus on one for they all shoot at you longer. after you get the lifesteal, it gets easier. This is, like everyone else has said, an addicting game, i can't stop until i die! it is very fun and colorful too! it is cheap right now and i probably will spend more time on this than in other current game by the way the narrator is hilarious!"

No two rooms are the same ever. Voiceover is comical and placed quite well. The enemies are challenging, and pose different threats depending on the random selection of what will show up. The powerups are useful and can be combined for different results, none of which are hindering. You can also form temporary armor that has different powers and stat bonuses depending on how you arrange them, so you have many options and lots of replay value. The RPG elements are also a great feature, each play through can be entirely different depending on how you build your character. Right now I'm tank and speed and it's working relatively well, but I do have to hit more to get kills.This gets a 10/10.

Although it needs a few tweaks here and there, its an overall solid game. The graphic style of this game really suits the name and gameplay. This game is very colourful and action packed. The Mob Maker 9000 and the random(ish) map generation keeps the gameplay fresh. The customisation of weapons and armour is immense, you can technically create it with any combo. And let me remind you that this game came out recently.You play as Pixel Boy. You run around weird dungeon things killing weird creature things and picking up weird boxes with weird effects. Weird, but in an excellent way.Pros and Cons:Pros:- Nice graphics- Replayability- Devs respond to the questions- Customisation- The soundtrackCons:- Dying screen is a little boring- Multiple glitches, nothing gamebreaking though.I give this game an overall rating of  8.5/10."

I like this game but the game play can become stale and that is a very common thing with this kind of indie came. I would like to see this game become a starting point for new developers but I can't say this game is revolutionary. I can play it for some time, but I end up becoming bored after playing for more than 45 minutes.

,Recommended,263080,10389293,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,C0URAGE,"I have played this game for awhile, and im here to give an honest review. This game is very fun, and addictive, but has some issues, more on that later. Firstly, the game is fun, the ""pixel powers"" are a unique and fresh feature for a rouge-like game. You get powers like bigger bullets, more spread from your shots, and you can even get flaming bullets, and tons more. You can combine the powers to make them even more deadly!! The enemies you encounter are kinda random, you face against ants, frogs, skulls, snakes, slimes, etc. But each have unique attacks. I have gotten to Act 3 now, and the levels never look the same, which is a cool feature. As you would expect in a rouge-like game, once you die you basically lose everything, except the levels, coins, and attributes you gave your character, but i feel like once you die, you should just restart the game, since you lose all the powers you got, and probably dont have enough coins to resupply yourself, but thats to be expected in a game like this. And finally, the bad things/glitches that might happen. The first bad thing, for me, is that the game is short, only 4 acts, and has little replayability, for me of course, but the devs said they are gonna add daily dungeons, so look up on that. The next thing is that the game kinda feels repetitive, other than the Mob Maker 9000 which randomly generates the enemies, you just look for the same three keys, or the RGB, and then you beat the level, and of course, at the end of each act there is a boss, each one i faced was fun and fast paced, really good fights. Those are the bad things, for me, now onto the glitches that you may get, and the ones i experienced. Some enemies or coins will fly off the level, and end up in the blackness, which makes it impossible to get or kill, and the other one is that the enemies will get stuck in the doors, and just wait for you to kill them. Other than that, no more glitches, that i experienced. Overall, this game was very good, i still havent beaten it, but i will. I recommened this game to anyone who like rouge-like games. 8.5/10"

The enemies aren't terribly varied, and the rooms generated for gameplay don't create any sort of challenge or depth. I wouldn't even mind how slow it is if I felt like I had somewhere to go.It's just kind of amateur. There's a hub world, but it's purely functional and eats up time; could have been just a menu. There's a ""crafting"" system, but your resources don't vary (since they come from a set number of enemies). There's no real quests or goals which is weird since they put so much time into the world. It's the classic issue where all the surface content-- the theming, the design, the ""hilarious"" narrator --was developed without a compelling game to put it on.I'd advise the crew to check out ""Radiant Inferno"" for an idea of how a game like this could work better.

There just aren't enough of them in the game and a few overlap what they do.  Even the room variety is very low.  You'll see most if not all the rooms in the very first floor with 16 total.  The game is even designed to get you permenantly stuck if you die too much since you'll be stuck in a later floor with only your basic attack.  Fortunately for that point (unfortunately for the game), this game is very easy.Early on you have to be careful.  Avoiding enemies and their attacks and conserving your ammo.  Not helped by the fact the doors to each room can easily obscure enemies and their bullets.  However, by the time I hit the second zone, I was already a death machine and things only snowballed for me from there.  Bonus health, lifesteal, and  bullets in all directions made me nearly invincible.  The only way I was dying at that point was if I decided to stop shooting and hug everything instead.  Bosses included.  There is a reason why the rarest achievement in the game is getting 100 deaths.  Personally, I won with only one death.  That may be the most damning sentence for a roguelite."

The voice acting and writing is awful, if you want to replay mute the voice.Edit:The reasons this game is bad:Enemies are boring and nothing special, the randomiser doesn't achieve anything. I completed the game and didn't see all of the enemies.Bullets are to easy to get, again throughout my one play through, the only time i had to get new power ups was when I died. As soon as i got a level 5 power up i could fire into a room, leave the room and everything would die.Armour, every single armour ""bonus effect"" is the same, they all do some type of area damage. Come on is it that hard to have 5 different effects.Power ups: 6000 combos is bull, you can combine 9 power-ups after that it is maxed out and you just make another 9 until you have 3 which achieves nothing as they didn't seem to stack in effect.Not to mention all the effects are boring and unoriginal: homing, big bullets. Come on something interesting, what about firework shots that explode into a colourful AOE, Or like snake shots that fire in the pattern a snake moves. YOU COULD THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER THAN THIS.......The levels are all the same, just minorly different environments, things like water or snowmen in the level, but it is still the same boring squares looking for keys to go down a level.There should be more than 4 levels, 2 hours for a playthough with no carry on is nothing in a rogue like....The art style is cheap and simple, it's just voxels, every single other indie title uses voxels as an easy way out... Voxels have been done before and they are nothing special.The music gets repetitive super fast, after 10 minutes I just muted it with the narratorIm sorry to rain on anyones parade that likes this game, but you are objectively wrong, this game is bad.Also, if you die on a run, just start the game again, without loads of money you can't survive.TL:DR This is not worth ten pounds, enemy design is boring, level design is unoriginal and the game reeks of feces.

Probably the highest amount of hours you can get in this game after seeing what it has to offer is 4 hours, FOUR HOURS.Now that's understandable, games can have a short story, and that's okay.But a roguelike? Roguelikes are made to endure endless replayability, not having slots to level up with no permadeath.Hardcore mode is easier than the original mode that this game offers, with more drops.A good example of an RPG without permadeath that still manages to be a roguelike is Hero Siege.

You know those games that aren't horrible enough to quit half way through, and you just feel like you need to finish it to get it over with? Pixel boy is that game. There is no challenge; as long as you keep enough money on you to repair armor you will never die. If you are the type of player who runs through rooms instead of clearing them one at a time, this game probably has a good pace for you, if you like it casual that is. I like to check every room and take it slow so-to-speak. but movement speed is a crawl even with speed modifiers and enemy attacks are even slower. Enemies are pretty standard Zelda clones. Predictable directional attacks and different speeds of melee attackArmor crafting is nothing special, type is based on the color you have the most of, there are no combinations beyond basic stats, for a roguelike this is disappointing, upgrading the tier only makes the basic stats more powerful. Weapon's don't ""Craft"" either, you can only add the listed effect to what you have already. don't expect spread shot and flaming pixels to give you a flame thrower or anything. At the end of the game you have easily 10-12 effects on one crafted powerup and you just face-roll over everything. You can only add one of each powerup to a crafted powerup. This is for balance but if the game was faster, and better such a craft would be right at home.Gameplay from start to finish for me was 5 1/2 hours, the rest of my recorded time was me getting up for food and bathroom. I consider myself a gamer of medium skill, if you are good and run through rooms you can easily beat this game in an hour. if you like it room by room like me prepare for a game lasting you 3 1/2 hours."

The gameplay is basic top down action fare, the controls are fairly well implemented but the moment to moment gameplay of moving and shooting is simply not that satisfying. Bullets waft out of your character and slowly float towards their target, enemies wander around in basic patterns often getting stuck in doorways and getting obscured by the scenery.The roguelike elements also fall short. Levels are randomly generated but in the most simplistic manner possible, essentially a grid of identical square rooms with the occasional corridor or removed walls. The enemies are picked from a pool at the start of the round, and while they are fairly varied there are never any great surprises. The customisation systems feel unecessarily micromanagey and don't afford any real variety. In short you aren't going to feel like you're getting much of a different experience when replaying the game, arguably the most important feature of roguelike games.Good points: the music is excellent, the narration is humorous and well voiced."

The maps are further padded out by empty rooms and a slow movement rate.If you are to believe that the core mechanic of the game is to combine power-ups to create powerful combinations you will be disappointed to find that although combining power-ups is kind of fun and does make for great visuals, the ammo management required and the pure unnecessary nature of the power-ups (the game is easily beatable without them) actually impedes your progress more than aiding it.[Updated 11.07.2014]"
,Not Recommended,263080,13049620,"Posted: 22 November, 2014",all,hitchiker42,"Pixel Boy is a game with a lot of failed potential, the core gameplay is fun but the bland environments, repitive enemies, lackluster bosses and simplistic crafting/progression system make Pixel boy a game not worth playing.I bought pixel boy because the trailer and screen shots looked exciting, the description promised a game with a lot of replay value and customization and the majority of reviews are positive. My first major disappointment was in learning that the weapon customization system was built around consumable powerups with 250 shots each, this leads to a lot of time spend managing ammo and switching to the basic shot type, rather then getting to use the different weapons. Which is a shame because the variety of weapon types and combinations are interesting and fun, but the limited ammo means you never get to really explore all the different options.My biggest issues with the game are the length and the difficulty. I beat the game on hardcore mode in about 3 hours, which felt like longer because the game really drags on. I felt little to no challenge after I was about 1/3 of the way through the game, and I only finished it because I felt like I had to. The game is composed of 4 acts of 4 levels each with a boss battle at the end of each act. There is no difference between any level, they are generated from a minimal set of rooms and populated with 4 randomly chosen monsters out of a fairly small set. The boss battles are a joke, the first boss is easy, but takes a long time to beat because of how under-powered you are at that point in the game, while the last 3 bosses can each be beaten in a matter of seconds.With a little bit of reworking of the progression system, an actual sense of difficulty and some more variety the game could be fun but as it stands it is a fairly dull game with hints of potential for something more. As far as I can tell from the steam page the game is not in early access or anything and the last update by the developers was over 5 months ago, so I don't hold out hope that the game will get better.I bought pixel boy for about 10$ and I would say it was worth about 25% of that. I would only recommend pixel boy if you can put up with the issues described above and the game is on sale for at least 50% off."

All the amazing powerups you collected while going through the dungeons are ALL lost along with everything else in your inventory when you die. When I die, I just don't want to play anymore because all my powerups are gone. And death comes fairly easily, too, once you get to maybe level 4, and you have enemies just spraying bullets everywhere at you."
