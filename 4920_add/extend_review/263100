It's difficult to say the least, yet I find it difficult to recommend this to anyone unless you want to donate and it's on sale.First of all, if I had to describe what this was, I would be more likely to call it an interactive art exhibit. The graphics and color choices are gorgeous of course, but all you do is walk on a beach, follow butterflies to items, spin the item until you locate another butterfly, then click on said butterfly, rinse, repeat.It was designed to be experienced, not played or beaten, and the subject matter is supposed to illicit an emotional response from the user. Unfortunately, I don't think that subject matter was conveyed properly for it's intended results.Honestly, if it wasn't for the discription on the store page, it would be hard for me discern the message this game is trying to convey. The idea is that each item you locate belonged to a victim of the Japanese Tsunami, however the game gives you no indication of this. After each item is located, the tide goes out a bit to uncover the next, maybe this was an artistic decision on the devloper's part to convey something deep. Locating the lost artifacts pushes the Tsunami back, acknowledging the victim's loss undoes the damage of the Tsunami, something like that? Maybe it's up to the player to discern for themselves how to interpert this. The focus of the game doesn't become clear until you locate the butterfly on the last item, which takes about 10 minutes from starting the game, if that. After which some text appears on the screen explaining the damage the Tsunami had done in Japan, then the credits roll.I feel terrible about not recommending this game due to the nature of the title. How can you say no when a percentage of the profits go to the Tsunami Relief Fund? I want to make it perfectly clear that I in no way disagree with the game's message, and support the developers for donating to the charity through this title, I just disagree with it's design. The message could have been conveyed in a more understandable and focused way. As I played I knew what this title was trying to do, I just never felt that it accomplished it's task, and that's the only reason I couldn't recommend it.Let this be a lesson to developers everywhere. Wanting to create a game to help educate the world of a foreign cataclysmic natural disaster, and to donate to a charity, is not enough. That game must be worth the time of the people donating, and more importantly, the game must make it's message clear. Otherwise people who wish to donate can just do it manually through the charity's website.Thank you Space Budgie for developing this title and choosing to help out of the kindness of your hearts. I'm sure families all over Japan praise your work and thank you for your time. I wish more developers would put their talents to good use by creating things like this in the name of charity. Please don't take the fact that I'm not recommending this game as a personal attack in anyway, or a stance against your message. Don't ever stop creating and helping humanity the best way developers can. Your work is appreciated, maybe even more than you know. However, as a reviewer, I have to be honest, even though in cases like this one, I wish I didn't.If you wish to donate to the Japanese Tsunami Relief Fund and other charities that the proceeds of this game are going towards without purchasing this game, here are some links.Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Relief FundAid For JapanPeople and Skills for Disaster Relief"

I enjoyed it immensely, and it gave me a closer understanding of the real losses of the victims of the Tsunami.

The world is entrancing; the music is magical; the premise is heart-warming. This game proves that you don't need a gimmicky gameplay element or splendiferous graphics to create a work of art. It's a game that shows emotion like no other, and relies on your empathy for other human beings, and your respect for human life. It may be short, but it is one of the deepest games I have ever played, and is dedicated to the men, women and children who died in the 2011 Japan Tsunami.A fully recommended buy."

Sadly, there is a cold, blunt truth in this statement. When we hear about a natural disaster or an ongoing war somewhere in the world, and read about the number of casualties on television screens, newspapers or history books, that's all we usually see: statistics. We live in an age that detachment and conformism are the norm, so it rarely bothers us enough to even think about collateral damage, if we are not a part of the collateral affected by it.Here, all you'll ever find will be a collection of blurry scenes, scattered around a beach lot in San Francisco, painted in shades of blue and purple. Not one of the greater works of Unreal engine, surely. As we start the experience, we are asked to follow the butterflies and that's all we are going to do for the next 15 minutes, until the game ends. We walk in the beach lot, approach disappearing shades and discover phantom objects to contemplate on people that we know nothing about. We probably never will...9.03mis not a game in the conventional manner. It is a really short, interactive art exhibition that serves as an empathy simulation. It is a tribute and a requiem for people who lost their lives in 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, aiming to humanize the victims by presenting hypothetical anecdotes from their lives, hopes and dreams. It is not a good game, neither necessarily quite successful in an artistic manner; but here with this specific project, it really is the thought that counts and nothing else. All profit made through the sales are sent to Aid for Japan and Redr charity organizations. With this ridiculously low price tag, it really is a choice of donating or not rather than buying a game.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

It took about 12 minutes to play through and was basically a tribute to the loss brought about by the 2011 Tsunami in Japan. Just a very pretty, contemplative look at the wreckage of such a disaster, provided in minimalist fashion via shadows that dissipate into items on the beach, which in turn represent the people who lost their lives, which in turn become butterflies (in the game anyway) whose souls flitter across the sky. Since all the proceeds from the game go to two specific relief charities, I would consider it to be a good investment, and it is a brief and yet touching game experience."

It makes aware the warning signs and effects of a tsunami to the player. 9.03m is a very deep and meaningful game, and the money from every purchase of a copy contributes to two wonderful charities which helps the victims of the Tōhoku tsunami.9.03m is all about symbolization, in which you need to figure the situation out for yourself. The total game doesn't take too long to complete, though the story is amazingly powerful. You're on a beach, on which the tsunami previously hit. Your task is to follow the glowing butterflies which lead you to the ghost of a victim. Heading to them in the dim moonlight, you will find a possession of theirs in which you need to find a clue to inform you of their name, history, etc. The whole game is based on supporting the victims and raising awareness, and in my opinion it has succeeded in that. 9.03m is not meant to be played as a game, more as a meaningful, sad and informative story.The game is simplistic though meaningful. Symbols are a large part of the game, creating mystery and suspense. With all it's revenue headed directly to the two charities, this game is worth the full price. An enjoyable and meaningful story."

This is when it succeds in the goal it set for itself, when it takes a few examples out of the 15000 casualties so that you can briefly know something about them: the tragedy behind events with high death tolls is that the faces and lives of those lost are easily shadowed behind numbers and I appreciate what 9.03m tried to do hence my thumbs up.Having said that it's short length and lack of any gameplay will surely turn some people off and I can easily concede that the message'd have been carried just as well using a video or other means.

An important story. The developers have described the game perfectly, without 'spoiling' anything. Since it lasts about 10-15 minutes it's hard to tell anything about it without 'spoiling' things. Therefore, I will repost the description that the developers have posted so you get a better understanding of what it's about:""9.03m, is a short, first person, art/empathy game for PC. Not a game in the traditional sense of the word; it aims to humanise, and remember the victims of the 2011 Japanese tsunami. The media is quick to put figures to death tolls in such disasters, and 9.03m tries to remind people of the individuals behind those figures.9.03m is set on Baker Beach in San Francisco, where debris from the tsunami has washed ashore in the years following the tsunami.""This is exactly the game, without any spoilers. It's a sweet story accompanied by subtle graphics and beautiful music. And since some of the money earned is given to charity it's money well spent. Especially for this price.[Rating: 72/100]"

It certainly attempts this, and does so in a rather direct way. Characters are memorialized only by the a silhouette and the items they leave behind. Each character represents a sort of trope - we have a child with a train missing a wheel, a women with a wedding ring, an older man with a pocket watch, among others. The symbolism is very on the nose, and this sort of heavy-handed approach takes away from the purpose of being a memorial. Coupled with the nice but overbearing music, during these sequences9.03mis basically saying, ""YOU SHOULD FEEL SAD HERE. APPRECIATE YOUR LIFE. BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE IT.""It also doesn't really seem to have all that much to do with a tsunami. Each time you collect an item the water on the beach recedes a small bit, but given that the beach is Baker Beach from San Francisco and that there's no evident tragedy here... well if I didn't know what the game was about then I probably wouldn't have really got it. It's generic enough that it fits as a memorial for basically any loss of life.I will say that I do like the art style and the environmental sounds. The crunch of the sand as you walk is quite nice.

Since then it has raised its price to $1, with the understanding that half goes to a charity. People have raised questions about the legitimacy of this charity, but its price and this ""charity offer"" did not affect my review.Okay, I know I'm not recommending this, so I anticipate downvotes, but I judge projects based on their goals. The goal of this game is to ""humanise and remember"" the victims. To do this, you walk from item to item, objects left behind by those who died, and examine them until a butterfly appears, leading the path to the next object. This happens perhaps six times and then the game ends with another brief cutscene. Looking at objects left behind can tell you a lot about the people who left them, but i didn't feel that way with this game. They're all very low-poly and contain no material that would teach one about the people involved, or fulfill the game's goal of humanising them. Beyond that, you walk slowly on a low-poly, two color beach. Because you are to follow a set path and theres no real reason to explore, it isn't really even interactive- there are no choices to be made. Neither is there any randomness, as in Dear Esther. So, as art, it kind of fails as well- the choice to make a small empathic project a game means that less money can be spent on the surroundings. If it were a video, (which it basically is, as there is no room for player incentive or experimentation,) the polygonal nature of the surroundings and the repetition would doom it. So, in my book, that dooms the game as well. It's only really about the victims of the tsunami because the game tells you it is, to be honest.If you feel like feeling sad, this game might make you feel sad. That's not enough for my personal recommendation."

These days I think the word ""art"" may be thrown around too loosely when it comes to games, but in this case it applies, taking a tragedy and making it accessible without dehumanising it.  9.03m captures history.Disclaimer:  I previously reviewed this game for Kotaku's reader-run blog, Talk Amongst Yourselves.

Like how an artist paints a memory, or puts emotion into an event, this game does the same thing. It shows a brief glimpse into the awareness of those lost in the Japanese Tsunami of 2011. The butterflies represent the spirits of those gone. As I've said, it's not a game. It's a small walkthrough to feel a little of the emotions of what happened. I think there should have been a little bit more in the remembrance and perhaps the exploration than what is there. The ending was beautiful, but I do feel like I'm missing something.Maybe that's the point.I'm not sure to give it a good or bad review. I want to give it a good one because I think this kind of thing should be encouraged , as it's a means of remembrance, which rings true for those who know and perhaps felt the sadness of what happened in Japan. It's also a way to contribute to the charities that exist to the people who survived, and who lost someone they loved. The idea is good as an art form.

With the missing Malaysian passenger jet and the crisis in Ukraine, March 11th rolled by without many pausing to remember the event. To those who were not directly affected by this tragedy, it is easier to forget--something that the developers of 9.03m have tried not to let happen.Calling 9.03m a game should be considered a crime. 9.03m is not a game, but rather an interactive memorial designed to make the startling number of deaths caused by the disaster feel more intimate and close, not half a world away. It tries to show that those who died were people like us--young and old, with hopes, dreams, and loves--and it does so admirably well.Experiencing 9.03m would feel more appropriate in a museum, not on Steam. But perhaps even there 9.03m would be out of place, surrounded by dead fossils and lifeless artifacts of civilizations gone by, because 9.03m is neither dead nor lifeless. Quite the opposite, in fact: 9.03m is a living reminder of those who are no longer with us because of the Fukushima disaster--much like their memories in the hearts of loved ones."

This is not. There is a hint of something beautiful in the blurry dream-like distance, but the sound effects are intrusive and the weird gamified hidden object mode feels out of place and cheap. I have a lot of patience for jankiness in indie games because i know the creators are often young and don't have armies of developers and artists to help them out, but when you compare this to something like TIMEframe - which has a similar theme of being a memorial - it just doesn't hold up.

Of course this would have been related to the fact that it is such a simple game, with a span of just over 15 minutes for me. However, I am not at all concerned with this fact, and neither should anyone considering buying this game. In fact, the emphasis on numbers and figures is exactly what the creator wants to divert the player's attention from with 9.03.Dedicated to those who died, were injured or unaccounted for in the 2011 Touhoku earthquake in Japan, 9.03 aims to give the lives of people behind the figures more meaning than just a number to represent a casualty. Not only was a person lost, but the rest of a child's life was taken. A potential family can no longer live happily together. Each of these are represented by a single memento that you find on the beach that the game is set on, and despite being only a simple object, you can't help but build a bigger picture in your mind about each one. About who might have owned it, what kind of a person might they have been, what kind of lives they led before the tsunami.9.03 gave me cause to consider all these things, and because of this I would say the creator has definitely succeeded with this game.

We always detach ourselves from these far flung places where interesting natural things happen because we imagine them to be less developed than us, less concious of their reality; but Japan is our equal, if not our better. Their people are just like us, just as developed, just as intelligent, just as wealthy.If anything, this game inspires a sense of solidarity with the Japanese people for their loss.Apparantly the proceeds of the purchase go to helping Japan recover, and while it may have been a year or two ago, we should know better than to think that when it's not on the news anymore that it's fixed.

Set on a tranquil shoreline awash in shades of indigo, you follow small, floating orbs towards shadowy figures of people. But upon reaching them each one disappears in front of you, an echo of a memory of someone that is now lost forever. In their place is left an item for you to examine relating to the person. This is where the real impact is made.A small snapshot into their life, we're given a tiny glimpse into the things that were important to them in some way, ranging from small, sentimental trinkets, to something of vastly more significance. It may be a mundane thing like a child's ball, or it could be something more profound like an engagement ring, heavy with the weight of all the meaning and potential that surrounds it. This is what personalises the event and the people, makes it more relatable and brings the realisation that these strangers we see on the news that seem a world away from us, were exactly the same as you and I. It brings everything closer, makes it seem more sort of... real in a way, being able to emotionally relate to it more so than we otherwise ever would.With every object examined, the water recedes further down the shore to reveal a new trail to follow and a new person at the end of it, almost as if the tsunami itself is being pushed back and the very people themselves are being reclaimed by us with each new realisation we have of them. But of course, they're not, another point which I think this makes very well, the sense of loss. When all's said and done this experience should take between ten and fifteen minutes to go through, but even in that short time it still manages to create great impact and thought, and most importantly, empathy, especially by the very end.50% of the cost of this goes toward Aid For Japan, with all further royalties going towards it once the production cost has been covered.

No game, but an experience piece, you literally walk from one tableau to the next. There are only a handful of these - each is a person who presents an object when you near it. Move the object around to find an icon. Click on the icon. See a piece of text (literally a sentence or less) and then follow the trail to the next tableau. It really is beautiful and could be applied to a number of situations, with modifications of setting and topic. It's easily worth the dollar price of admission, as long as you understand you are buying a short experience and not a ""game"".

Fundraiser?  9.03m sets out as none of these, yet achieves all of them.  In emotion, in story structure, even in 'game play', it evokes one of those memorable Ocarina of Time moments – just walk and look long enough, and maybe you will begin to see.  See how disparate peoples are united by common desires; how the things we care for most, those that shine brightest in our lives, are given to - and taken so easily - from us.  But this isn’t a game, or a story, or even a tribute. It’s an appeal – to the inter-connectedness of human experience.From a sensory point of view, 9.03m is pretty much flawlessly realised.  Visually, aurally (with an excellent musical score) and in terms of involvement. The pace is slow.... but maybe it needs to be.  We're all accustomed to fast-paced, instantly gratifying 'action'... 9.03m tells us to stop, take a moment to look around and listen....  it's all too easy to allow our tendency towards disregard to blind us to the plight of others.  From a technical point of view if, like me, you're taken by the desire to just explore, then there's a fair chance you'll end up losing your bearings and feeling it might just be possible to miss something... and that’s not something you want to do.  Interactively, or emotionally.Rarely have I been so moved by something that, by definition, exists to be experienced only through the distant medium of keyboard and mouse.  Buy this title."

They are not intended to tell an explicit story but rather make you think about what the item meant to that person (and some are absolutely heartbreaking, honestly).We can't easily wrap our minds around numbers like ""sixteen thousand dead"" or ""two thousand missing"" but we CAN understand something like this, which forces us to acknowledge that every one of those people was a unique human being.

It's a very atmospheric linear adventure game that explores the aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake/tsunami. The gameplay is very simple; all you do is follow a trail from one point to the next, examining objects to learn their origins.The good: This game is dripping with atmosphere, all you have to do is look at the screenshots in order to see that. The art direction is excellent as well, as is the music.  While the game doesn't always succeed at packing an emotional punch(which I'll get into later), there is one moment where I was fighting back tears.Now for the bad. While the art direction is solid, the quality of the art is pretty low. I also ran into a number of graphical issues that are inexcusable in a game with a run-time of about 10-20 minutes, such as low draw distance and, again, especially bearing in mind the length of the game, very low resolution models and textures. For a game that sells itself on emotion, the majority of it will leave you bored. After you successfully identify the owner of each object, you have to watch a long, slow, cut-scene. It doesn't help that you move very slowly in-game. There are a few other issues that I won't get into, since they won't impact most other people, but this game is surprisingly unpolished, again, for something as small as it is.So in conclusion, yes, I recommend it, if only because of the fact that all money made goes directly to charity."

The player, for lack of a better word, is able to project whatever they want to believe or make of the tragedy. In my case for example, I saw the often quiet determination of the Japanese people with each object I interacted with. The music in particular helped reinforce this thought in particular. It really is what you make of it, what does the disaster mean to you?It may sound like I'm contradicting myself, but the message the developers intended to send shines through in spite of and because of this and pays special tribute to all those lost. It’s a reminder to look at things on a microscopic level whenever possible, and to empathize with others.

,Recommended,263100,7820918,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Snivets,"9.03m is a self-described ""art/empathy game"", which really means it's part of the recent Games For Change genre (which also includes games like 'Papers, Please'). This is a short, highly exploratory, wander-em-up style presentation that presents you with the discoveries of a sequence of artifacts along San Francisco's Baker Beach. These items, conceivably simply forgotten detritus to any other game, carried wayward by strange unfathomable currents and deposited on the West Coast of America about 12 months after the tsunami, convey way more than words or numbers alone ever could, and burrow themselves in your brain in the most human of ways.Gameplay is as simple as possible: find an object, learn a bit about it, move onto the next. The presentation is tightly controlled, as only one object is visible at a time – the tide recedes as you collect each object, revealing the next. With that level of distraction removed, there's more time to focus on the several objects you'll find. These objects are intensely sentimental in nature: a teddy bear, a pocketwatch frozen at the time of the tsunami's impact, a music box with an entwined couple inside. Subtitles are occasionally present, but sparse - no more than five found throughout the game's duration.Even in a brief glance over this game, I was aware of it being purported as heavily emotional. For a while, I wasn't sure if I was convinced I felt the same levels – people speaking of tears and the like. The game's climax, though, is where it shines, and yes, that prophecy came true. This is one game that is exactly the right length – about 20 minutes, and it's at around that time when you can expect to be most impressed with what it does right. It's not artsy in the overwhelming, over-the-top cheesy sense you might expect from anything that didn't begin as a graduate student's thesis project; much like Goldilocks' proverbial porridge, this game is ""just right"" on virtually every aspect. Rest assured, you don't have to ""get"" symbolism or ""art"" to understand this game.I could say more about this game, but I firmly believe the best advice is to go play it yourself. It's $2, and half (50 percent!) of that goes to Aid For Japan, which if I'm not mistaken means you're a meanie if you're not buying it.9.03m is exactly the kind of game you understand you're missing out on when you spend mid-September doing nothing but thinking about the next-gen system you're eagerly awaiting. I feel better about gaming as a medium with this kind of confident production being the first out the gates of a newly established game studio, and you should too. #masterrace( from The Nascent Gamer blog –http://nascentgamer.blogspot.com/2013/11/903m.html)"

But I think that the execution undoes the whole point.The game is about putting a human face and soul to the number of lives lost in the 2011 tsunami. Unfortunately, the gameplay does not support this in the slightest. I have no problems with 'walking simulators' when the walking has a purpose in relation to the message. Here, there are no choices, there is only one path, and the metaphor is so blandly obvious that it ends up uneffective.While I don't want to say what a game should or should not be, I think if the developers wanted to tell this story, they should have had HUNDREDS of objects wash up on the beach, and have it be free to choose which objects you want to look at and examine. Not just to add gameplay, but to give the onus and agency of realisation to the player. Have the player organically grow an attachment and develop feelings to empathise with the tragedy. By having a very limited number of objects, and having it scripted to the point where you're just walking on one path, the realisation that each object was attached to a person gets completely lost. We've barely gotten connected to the situation when the game ends and shows all its cards. We can't help but wonder why the game didn't let us learn about all these lives organically rather than a ham-fisted souls departing ending.Once again, I love indie games, I'm a sucker for art house, but for me, this game missed the mark and even worse, missed out on an opportunity to say something profound about a huge loss in life."

Well, merely at face value its an Indie art nongames like Proteus, Dear Ester before it, about the 2011 Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami. Delievered in a sombre, but empathic fashion. But unlike Proteus which had you envelope yourself in the sounds and sites of an island, or Dear Ester puts you in the shoes of a man dealing with loss and guilt; 9.03m doesn't have a underlying mechanic or a layered subplot. Its simply serves as a guided tour across a retreating shoreline, inspecting lost belongings.For much of it I just couldn't understand what this game was trying to convey, it was almost lost to me. But having seen it through and given it time to sink in I think that is supposed to be the point of 9.03m. Tragedy is something you can never really comprehend.

Overall theres not many things to talk about this game since its really short and theres not much to do in it. To say the gameplay is good and simple walk around and look for clues.The art style is beutifull and looks amazing and is a fiest to the eyes.

This basically amounts to a 15 minute linear walkthrough in a single level. It doesn't do anything interesting with the medium, in fact it squanders some potentially great imagery with its poor execution, which is doubly frustrating for me since the ""lots of people on a beach under the stars"" is something I'd use in my own projects.Anyway, avoid this one unless you want it forever at the top of your steam games list."

,Not Recommended,263100,31110826,Posted: 12 April,all,Station Earth,"9.03m is the kind of title you wouldn't necessarily call a ""game"". It's definitely more like a first person ""experience"". But for the sake of this review, the word ""game"" will be used. There is minimal interaction in 9.03m, you are for the majority of the game just walking from point to point looking at certain mementos with little text talking about victims in the unfortunate incident. The entire 'game' is essentially just a remembrance of a catastrophic tsunami that happened in Japan in 2011. The description of the game even says it isn't a ""game"" in it's traditional sense (meaning by definition, it isn't a game). If you perceive it to be a game, then by all means it is what you want it to be. The developer however does mention it is an empathetic art piece, using the word ""game"" very loosely. Thus, you should be aware of what you are getting yourself into when considering to buy ""9.03m"", you areNOTbuying an actual ""game"" where you solve problems and have objectives to complete.Appropriately, 9.03m is a walking simulator. Controls do not matter as the only controls is ""WASD"" and the interaction key. The atmosphere is definitely gloomy and your character moves rather slowly which can be boring and is a pet peeve of many people. That being said, it is also very relaxing. If you're the kind of person that enjoys walking simulators that are very calm and relaxing, 9.03m might be right up your alley. The length of the game isn't long to the point where it gets boring and repetitive, but it isEXTREMELYshort racking up around 30 minutes of total gameplay (at most). So if you seek the kind of adventure and action many triple A titles have, this is definitely not for you. The setting is extremely bland as you can see in the screenshots and about 95% of the entire map is empty terrain with no purpose. The game does not need to span out 1000 square yards when only 50 of that space is being used.When addressing cost, I don't believe the money that goes into buying this game goes to a good cause, relief group nor organization that some might say/think. So if you plan on buying it because you want to donate for the better good, you might be slightly blinded as I don't know if the money collected actually goes towards any sort of charity. If you look at it in terms of buying it just to play it, You are basically paying about a dollar for about half an hour of walking (If you explore the entire map) and about 5 minutes of the total playtime is looking at mementos. In my opinion, it isn't worth the money and in fact, not any at all.Long story short, it's a heartwarming experience but it shouldn't put a price on it.I personally enjoy walking simulators and actually enjoyed this. Despite that, I can not recommend this primarily due to the fact that it's not worth it for the price. The enjoyment I got from this game did not compensate for the money I spent on it. This is the kind of title people should be able to experience for free. It's a primitive, atmospheric, and beautiful piece of art in my opinion, but it shouldn't charge people just to experience it's ""story"". If it were free, then yes, I would recommend it, why not? It's short as it is and will take the average person about 15-20 minutes to complete. Unfortunately though, it isn't free. It's a unique experience but spend your money elsewhere unless you don't mind paying a dollar for 15-20 minutes of walking. (it's only a dollar after all).TL;DRIONLYrecommend this to people who enjoy very calm and relaxing walking simulators (that are extremely short) andstrictlyso. As well as being comfortable paying around the average dollar for it. If you do not meet that criteria specficially, then you will not find your dollar well spent. Besides that, I doNOTrecommend it not because it's bad, but because of it's sheer price tag (for what it is)."

It had some strange design choices. To start out, I decided to walk along the path I was placed upon backwards.  For some reason, this led to the title screen.  I started again, and was forced to rewatch the camera pan over several spots again.  This didn't seem to serve any greater artistic purposes, and was quite annoying.At one point, I was for some reason tasked with climbing a rock, but because I could not see the face of the rock because of the art style, I had to randomly run into it in several directions in hopes of finally climbing up an invisible path carved on the rock's face.  I eventually succeeded, but it took me 5-10 minutes to figure out, which really took me out of the game.  Again, a poor design choice.The last choice that bothered me was just plain odd.  The game takes place on a beach, and throughout the game I assumed it took place in Japan, where the tsunami hit.  Perhaps I missed a flash of text, but nothing I noticed led me to believe otherwise.  Then, just befroe writing this review, I read in the description that ""9.03m is set on Baker Beach in San Francisco, where debris from the tsunami has washed ashore in the years following the tsunami.""  I found this quite surprising that the developers chose to place a bit of information, which to me, is essential to the artisitic experience of the game, in the description, but not prominently in the game.Again, while I do appreciate what this game was trying to do, evoke emotion about the tragedy that occured because of the tsunami in Japan, I feel that some bad design choices got in the way of what the game was trying to do."

It isn't even a game, and if you expect it to be then this review is not for you.Gameplay was not exciting.  I was not excited for a majority of the game.  But it was relaxing.  It's simple; find the stuff that's clearly marked and find the butterfly.  They even give you trails.  It was, as someone commented prior ""Like an interactive art gallery"" which I enjoyed.  I like art galleries.  It was bland, but I think that was intentional so as to encourage a state of reflection within the player.  Tranquility and simplicity were the main points of the little gameplay there was, and I found it intruiging and calming.Personally, I liked the graphic scheme.  I thought that, while not particularily appealing to the decrotive aesthetic, the graphics of the game had their own unique charm that overall fit the purpose it was designed for.  The dullness and darkness to me emphisised the sadder nature of the game and seemed fitting for the subject.I can't say that I'm thrilled with the sound, of which there seemed to be very little.  I think that, despite everything else, it could have been so much better if therehad only been a little more music.  Although what music there was was enjoyable, the addition of more music would have been much better.  Also, the footsteps get obnoxious after a while.Summing it up, I think that this game is good for a 7.5 out of 10.  I'm being generous because I enjoyed the gallery-style play, but that is not what most players on here are for.  While the gameplay was simple and calming, it was bland and repitious and offered no mental stimuli other than the (somewhat optional) reflection on the lost lives.  The graphics were also relatively bland but keeping in the game's context I think suited the game well.  THe lack of sound frustrated me and I think that the game would have been much better for the music.If you want to donate .99 cents to a cause and get something from it, then this may be a good idea.

It will probably give some little looks into the lives of those we lost, and it could be an intense tearjerking experience.How wrong I was.I keep seeing the words Humanise, Empathy, and Character Development. I'm not entirely sure people are talking about the same game. The entirety of the game consisted of watching some butterflies fly to a silhouette, then following them at the speed of an 80-year-old down a Walmart aisle.Once you reach the silhouette, it turns into an item! At first (the first item being a soccer ball) I thought, oh man, here it comes. The waterworks are.... Oh it has the kid's name on it... Are people really so dilluted as to not humanize people until they see a name on a soccer ball?Then, the item turns into a butterfly and does the whole cutscene/slow walk song and dance again. Items include: A wedding band with an inspirational quote in the band (unlike every wedding band in the world), a box that plays music, an empty baby cradle (Which would have been more powerful if I wasn't bored out of my skull and having ordinary items shoved in my face) and... Actually I can't even remember any of the other items.In the end, this 15 minute game failed to instill any more empathy than I already had for the people affected by the 2011 tsunami. There was absolutely zero character development. There was no powerful imagery. And I'm really disappointed. This game could have been powerful. It could have had some real content. It could have drawn in some real attention for itself and the charity it's supporting. Instead, I just wasted 15 minutes of my life.Don't buy this game. Give the money you would have spent directly towww.aidforjapan.org.uk- In fact, give them more. They need it if this is the best game they could have made for them."
