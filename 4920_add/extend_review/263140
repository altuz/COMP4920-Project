For all of the promise the premise of investigating several characters and picking one to die carried, the execution including perhaps 6 rooms and less than 10 characters left me feeling as if there was much more possibility to be played with and explored than is offered here.It held my attention while I played it, and I was very interested to see how my decisions might influence the outcome of the game, but ultimately I don't feel as if I got enough play time out of the title for it to have been worth the dollar value I paid for it."
,Recommended,263140,8808978,"Posted: 22 January, 2014",all,[AReV]BavarianGod,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jT_BYXPZIThe indie scene is more prominent than ever boasting a diverse selection of games that often serve as bite sized reprieves from major triple A releases. While the indie scene isn't immune from uninspired copy and paste designs, there have been a string of recent releases that depart from traditional game design in a major way, challenging what we think of as games. One of the more overlooked releases that fits into this growing segment of games is Postmortem: One Must Die which tries to test players by forcing them to make a single decision that promises to have far reaching consequences. While major releases have tried to accomplish this same goal on a large scale, most have come up short. Does Postmortem's smaller and more focused scope deliver more satisfying results?Playing as an agent of death, it's your duty to take the life of one person from a fund raising gala in a fictitious turn of the century setting on the cusp of an industrial revolution. The nation is split with conservatives that believe in upholding tradition at the expense of progress for women and greater economic development. Meanwhile progressives are riding a wave of industrial prosperity at the expense of  their workers. Both sides have admirable qualities and some absolutely abhorrent qualities which quickly muddies the line between noble and contemptible. Unbound creations has expertly balanced the qualities of each side of the conflict to tear gamers and make who they choose to snuff out a real struggle. Your potential targets rage from an influential member of the media to a young, idealistic student. Each person leans strongly in one direction and by thoroughly exploring the dialog tree you might find that your conversations with these characters may have quite an impact on them in the future...Gameplay in Postmortem simply involves wandering around in an isometric world slathered in Victorian decor, scavenging details from news articles strewn about and talking to the patrons of the gala. Each character has a lengthy dialog tree that will allow you to acquaint yourself with them as well as current events. A wide variety of responses and questions are available and not asking questions can also have an impact on how the events play out. Dialog is generally well written but it can be a bit too purpose driven. Postmortem never creates the illusion that you are just another patron making small conversation, your pointed questions make each interaction feel like an interrogation rather than a conversation. The blatant agenda to your questions never allows the characters to show you who they are, they merely share what they perceive themselves to be.Your interactions with the gala patrons ultimately culminate in your character deciding who should meet their end. Once your decision has been made, a series of newspaper articles show the results of your involvement at the Gala. It's not the most invigorating way to see the consequences of your actions unfold but there may be a few surprises for some players to uncover based on your actions. Also, a link to detailed player stats is viewable upon completing a play through to show how your behavior compares to other Post Mortem players. A thorough playthrough exploring all of the dialog options will take in the neighborhood of an hour and subsequent playthroughs will take less time. It doesn't take long to figure out what dialog has what impact so many players may not want to take the time to explore every possibility. The beauty of Postmortem however is that you are not required to buy it to enjoy the core experience. By purchasing the game, players are given an extra character to chat with as well as wallpapers, concept art and some behind the scenes development materials.Like its triple A predecessors, Postmortem falls short of delivering a wholly satisfying choice based narrative. That is not to say that it isn't a worthwhile experience however, it's morally ambiguous world and intelligent and fresh setting remain engaging and some of the conclusions are engaging and surprising. It's brevity makes it easy to pick up sporadically and enjoy. I for one hope that Postmortem is simply an amuse-bouche, tantalizing our pallets for something a bit larger and scope and more accomplished in execution from Unbound Creations."

Unfortunately it can be very short or as long as you want it to be, this is because there is essentially one ""map"" and literally you only get to kill one person.The concept behind it all is that you talk to everyone and pick the choices you want. Those choices will then affect the ending you gain. Essentially you then play through again and again, each time picking different choices and the person you ""claim""Overall, there should be more to this game as I was hoping there would be something after the first level but literally the game can last 2 minutes (if you randomly pick someone and don't care about the choices or how they affect the story) or hours long if you decide to explore and go deeper trying to find every combination and choice"

There is only one ""act"" (one level of the game to play through) which took me 30 minutes when I spoke to every person in the room and went into a couple of side rooms. Each conversation with each NPC can become a very long, very boring dialogue you cannot get out of until you go through the whole thing. Conversations would have been more interesting if they were much shorter and not so useless. I typically learned everything I wanted to know early on in each conversation.There is nothing in the game to prevent you from choosing a random target to kill, so you can easily pay $7.00 for less than one minute of gameplay.Overall, this game was an interesting concept which was stuffed with uninteresting monologues and only one act.

You can read a few newspaper clippings strewn about and go into very superficial conversations with the guests, mainly concerened with a conservative/liberal conflict in their imaginary country. Conversations are often ended abruptly and guests would stop speaking to you afterwards, leaving you with very little to go on. Once you've made a choice, an epilogue is shown, presenting the results of your choice and any influences you may have had on the guests due to dialogue options.Overall, it feels incomplete and the story and characters are uninteresting and the resolution is very anticlimactic. Seeing one resolution is enough as it gives you a fair idea of what would've happened if you had done things differently.

It's execution and premise are pretty damn great. However, it remains an underdeveloped idea that is not worth five Euros in my opinion. The idea of saving, ruining or keeping the status quo of a country torn by two opposing sides of an industrial revolution is a great idea, but the game offers but one scenario. One that can be replayed a lot of times, but still, it's but one scenario in what could have been a very deep and amazing political simulator.On their site, you can get the game for free, or pay what you want. I like supporting Indie developers, but the Steam price is way too steep. So I'd suggest getting this from their site and paying around 1,50, which I feel is a fair price for a nicely executed idea that needs quite a bit more depth to justify paying more."

The following are reasons why this game fell short of that mark.1. Very poor sprite animations. Distractingly hideous.2. An abundance of grammatical and spelling errors.3. Meaningless conversation choices.4. Lazy variation of endings, despite being the selling point of this game.A few good surprises were had though.1. The ending (nothing more than a collection of news clippings) is altered by more than your choice of victim. Your conversations with the dinner guests can convince them to do certain things which affect the ending.2. The history of the world is well realized.3. No hand holding. You are thrown into the world and left to experiment. The game doesn't make it particularly obvious how to get the ending you want. Killing the guy you dislike the most might actually result in a bigger ""villain"" rising to power. Going to places you're not supposed to might get you in trouble.4. You're free to make tough moral decisions. All of the characters are likable and hatable in the same breath. The game doesn't bludgeon you with a preachy message, nor does it bore you with a simple tale of good guy vs. bad guy.At its total, this game would look great on the drawing board. There are many areas of this game that make the player excited with the possibilities, but it doesn't feel like a completed game. As a free flash game (or demo) this game would be acceptable, but at 7 dollars I can't recommend this to anyone, even the most hardcore of text-based fans."
,Recommended,263140,8076238,"Posted: 16 December, 2013",all,DeadPoolX,"This is a strange title, because at times it's almost more of a detective/choose-your-own-adventure book than a game. Yes, you play it, but the majority of that game play involves walking around, reading notes and papers, making decisions, referring to your journal, and talking to people.In fact, I should point out that you'll be doing a LOT of talking. If you normally dislike lots of dialogue (which is mostly silent, so no voice actors beyond a word or two every so often) then don't get this game. Fortunately, you don't have to remember every little detail as vitally important information is automatically written down in your journal.The story is you're a novice reaper (okay, get ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" out of your system before you continue reading) on your first assignment. You're told that ONE person must die at the gala you're attending. Admittedly, it's a very small gala, since there's only about six people there.What happens next is you read various notes and newspapers (and even open some safes and unlock doors, if you manage to get the right keys) and talk to each of the six individuals there. Every single person will have varying views on the shakey political situation going on and have something to say -- both bad and good -- about other people there.None of the attendees are ""innocent"" in that each one has their own faults. One man is very sexist and thinks women shouldn't enter the workforce, while at the same time wants more rights for male workers. Likewise, one woman has some very feminist views (as in equality, not male bashing), but is extremely anti-immigrant and wants ""those people"" out of her country.  There's also poor vs rich issues and arguments about whether violence means are justified to change current conditions.In other words, everything discussed in the game is a reflection of real life, both past and present. What's interesting about that is you have the chance to agree with them and further encourage their current point of view or argue a counterpoint, sometimes changing their mind.Once you make your decision about who to kill, you'll see the reports detailing the aftermath. All of your actions -- who you decided to kill and what you discussed with the survivors -- play a role in shaping the future social and political climate.There are some negative points, however. The game uses a somewhat primitive sprite-based 2D isometric graphical style, which for some reason or another, randomly experiences slowdown while walking. The resolutions offered are also limited.There's virtually no mouse support other than clicking on menu buttons, so almost everything is controlled via the keyboard. That wouldn't be so bad if the controls didn't feel clunky.There are numerous grammar and spelling issues in the dialogue. The font used is also small and the letters appear squished together, which makes reading sometimes a chore. That's a huge black mark against the game considering you'll spend more time reading than not. I will admit that I played this on a laptop with a screen resolution of 1366x768, so the font may be easier to read with larger screens and higher resolutions.As far as I know, there's no way to save your game. Granted, the game isn't terribly long, but if you want to see all the outcomes, you'll have to talk to everyone each time you play and some dialogue trees can be very long. So while you could immediately go and kill different people right from the start, you wouldn't have affected anything (other than murdering someone) without talking to everyone first.Post Mortem: One Must Die (Extended Cut) is  currently $6.99 USD on Steam or offered at varying prices on the developer's website. The regular version (which lacks numerous extras, including a new character) is also available for FREE by the developer athttp://postmortemgame.com/download/"

But the game's greatest failing lies in the fact that, for a game that is 99% text and reading, there seems to have been NO editing or proofreading done! Sentences end mid-statement, words are missing from many sentences, misspellings abound, and the grammar and syntax are often TERRIBLE. The premise offered so much promise, but the execution was sorely lacking."

It is a little expensive for the limited gameplay you can get out of this game.I love how you get to know the people in this story and can really change their mind, while making up your own mind. It forces you to think about your own political value.The game has some replay value as the game consists of multiple endings."

It is one decsision to make and then youre done. it feels like it should be more of a demo than an ""extended cut"". I am sorry I paid for this game in its current state.I recomend against buying this game unless it is made much longer, so you can actually get your money's worth out of this game.3/10"

It had an interesting idea and concept, the character art is very nice, and it did spark my interest, because hey, this is the kind of game I'd love to play!But sadly enough it fell rather flat. After killing one person, you're done, and that's nothing that takes a long time. Trying to play it again gets repetitive, there's absolutely nothing new to do and whoever you kill you still get the exact same ending."
,Not Recommended,263140,18771962,"Posted: 30 October, 2015",all,AManEatingBear,"Postmortem is quite an interesting experience.  You know those games where you get to make decisions and influence the world and it changes your playthrough as you continue through it?  This is like those except because it's one level it's less of a chance for roleplaying and more of a puzzle.  You must figure out ""How do I do the most good on this most inconspicuously fateful of nights?""Now Postmortem is not without its flaws.  This is not a polished game.  The option to rebind your keys is not even in the game itself but instead comes with the game in a different file that you can select to run when you start up the game.  A few noticable typos are present as well, which is both surprising in a game that's like 60% text, but also not surprising considering the amount of text. There was also an interesting agreement to make when starting it up that you won't hold the developers responsible for damages coming from the game, though everything on my computer seems fine so far.  I will admit I do not reccomend the game at its standard $3 price.  But if it sounds intriguing to you and you don't mind the extremely rough edges, go for it when it's on sale."

My only worry is that regardless of the choices the length and depth of the game will mean that you see a lot of it real quick. If you can get it on sale the better, if you are looking for a quick little romp this is a good game but if you are looking for something you can sink your teeth into and invest in give this game a pass."
,Not Recommended,263140,14252834,"Posted: 30 January, 2015",all,-PEves-,This is just bad! This game is not even a game. What you see in the store page IS the whole game. That is all there is to it. there is 1 level which isn't even very long and when you are done it feels like you played a prologue to something that should be much bigger and isn't. Replayability: nil. Look at the time I put into this. That is all the game had to offer from start to finish. The game could have potential if it had levels and if they were a bit bigger than it's one and only level which seemed like a meer intro tutorial.Rating 1/10

,Recommended,263140,19433336,"Posted: 2 December, 2015",all,hojusimpson81,"There is a bloody conflict between Newagers, who care little for history and culture, and Oldagers, who wish to remain set in the traditional ways. You are Death, and are assigned to a fundraising party held to benefit (although the term is applied loosely) a school that was recently vandalized. Guests come from all walks of life, and have their own political beliefs and emotional attachments. Everyone there plays a role in the hostilities, and it is your job to select one who must die -- thus sending events hurtling in a particular direction.You could simply approach anyone, tap them on the shoulder, and that's that. However, the real meat of this game is to investigate each room, ask many questions about events and each attendee, and maybe even sneak a peek at some hidden items. At the end, take a look at your journal and select the one who will have the greatest impact (for better or for worse). Once the deed is done, a series of news articles will pop up and show you the fruits of your labour. You'll also have a brief, albeit rather pointless, scene with your target. After this, you can compare your choices to others, much like in the Telltale adventure games.Okay, let's get the bad out of the way first.1) The resolution options are limited.2) There's a distracting amount of screen tearing.3) The controls are fiddly.4) There seems to be an average of one spelling mistake every sentence.5) Once you've exhausted the 20 or so dialogue options for every character, and there aren't many of them, the game essentially ends. Well, unless you want to stand around and listen to the snippets of classical music that make up Postmortem's soundtrack.6) The political beliefs are fairly simplistic (e.g. foreigners are bad, women don't deserve rights, capitalism is awesome, etc.) and aren't as nuanced, or blended as I'd like.So what's good about it?1) There aren't many games like this. A locked room... er, make that a locked apartment mystery, with no real right or wrong answer.2) A hefty amount of backstory and information links the characters together, be it psychologically, socially, emotionally, etc. A fair amount of thought went into all this.3) It doesn't overstay its welcome. As I mention in Neg.6, there isn't much to do after talking to the people, so you can make your decision rather quickly -- perhaps in 45-60 minutes should you examine every nook and cranny, and draw out every last line of dialogue.I do wish there had been a few more locations. I read a review mentioning attending a protest, maybe also visiting the host's factory, and so forth. Then again, I believe this would only expose some weaknesses in the game's foundation. Nonetheless, with more and/or stronger writers (and an editor!), I think this could work, and work well.Is Postmortem a great game? No, but it's definitely not a bad one. It has a strong premise, and good parts, but is brought down by its linearity and lack of polish. Nonetheless, it can be found on sale often, and at a steep discount, it's an experience I would recommend.Just know what you're getting into first."
