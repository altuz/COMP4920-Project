I want to believe that some day we'll see some actual good PC ports of their games. I want to believe.Mind you this is an offline-only version. It appears that NETWORK mode was lost during the migration from GFWL to Steamworks. As for the rest this version is identical to GFWL one.P.S.: There is a bug that was reported to be present since the initial release that locks framerate to 30fps after a certain PC uptime. You'll have to restart your PC to unlock a higher framerate."

And without netplay, why even bother.The soundtrack was a nice touch though. Didn't count on that."
,Recommended,263300,9094002,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Lucian [T.C.],"Short Version: Worth a buy.Detailed Version: For a few minutes I couldn’t figure out how to get my damn PS3 controller working with the game (had to set it to XBox settings on DS3). That’s not a problem with the game however. As for how it works, it ran pretty responsively, and the command inputs were near-perfect. (Bang’s Astral is still ♥♥♥♥ing hard to pull off and I haven’t done it yet) Performance-wise in terms of FPS and lag, there was no delay, and any slowdowns the game might’ve experienced were due to the fact that I’m playing it on a crappy two year-old laptop. Otherwise, slowdowns were minimal, and they didn’t make the game unplayable. The Steam port of BBCT isn’t the best PC fighting game I’ve played, (better than how KOF13 ran but not as well as Skullgirls or Guilty Gear Isuka) but for 10 bucks it’s worth a shot if you’re a BlazBlue fan. And the one plus to Steam? If you buy it, you have it for GOOD. So if your computer dies and you need a new one, you can redownload BBCT on it free of charge.And hey, if enough people buy this, that might convince Arksys to bring Continuum Shift and their other fighters to Steam. :D Here’s hoping for Chronophantasma and Persona 4 Arena as well."

,Recommended,263300,12561914,"Posted: 18 October, 2014",all,LeGloriousUnderboob,"First of all, Blazblue's one of my favourite fighting games/franchises of all time since I played it on PSP years ago and I've played all kinds of fighting games since Street Fighter EX2 Plus (if I remember correctly) so I would highly recommend it to any fan of the genre. Most negative opinions about the game (from myself n others I guess) are mainly due to knowledge of the better sequels that are not available on PC (yet?) It feels like we're being told to be grateful for having anything at all. Thanks to Arc System Works I can cry myself to sleep...Note: I would have a lot more hours if my PC didn't currently have problems n bluescreen when I played some games :/ but I played lots before Steam version.I type a lot :lTl;dr (too long; didn't read): read bold text.Valve:bold text needs to be bolder.Graphics:I put this first 'cause of the game's description of being the first hi-res 2D game, I find this particularly awesome (in all modern 2D fighting games) 'cause these games use pixel art whereby characters and most in-game elements are drawn pixel by pixel and char/sprite animations are done via the same way as GIF images that play according to button input. I'm only assuming this is still how it works today and although I think KOFXIII's pixel art is more godlyBlazblue does a great job in keeping the characters alive throughout the battle & making beautiful, fun and non-distracting stages. Animations are smooth and special effects/attacks are pretty. You also get a wide variety of colour palettes when picking a character, more than most other games I've played, just remember to press start when selecting char. The UI/main menu is also very nice & simple.P.S. You can skip pretty much all loading screens - just press start - how awesome is that!Gameplay:For those not very familiar with fighting games, one thing to note is the main difference between 3D & 2D fighting games (IMO) is the pacing. Blazblue: Calamity Trigger incorporates this very well for me;it's very fast-paced and requires almost if not constant input and quick response (in a good/hard match). The basic mechanics are very simple. Main input commands are 'weak attack', 'medium attack', 'strong attack' and 'drive' which is a special attack/ability that is unique to each character. Characters don't have a very large skill set but as with many 2D fighting games you can kinda make your own combosas you get used to the mechanics, making efficient use of your 'drive' & your position. There aremany levels of difficulty to use to your advantage ranging from ""very easy"" to ""hell mode""so you can go from absolute beginner to master I guess :D and the AI is nothing to laugh at either.Button response has about no delay in this game and attack animations are quickso countering and whatnot are something to look out for (I'm looking at you Hakumen).Each character has about 2 super moves and one 'Astral' move, astral moves are highly animated finishing moves that must be unlocked for most chars and can only be used under certain circumstances, rendering you high with joy when you get to use them.Story (mode):There is an arcade mode and a story mode, each with different endings for each character. First thing that really gave this game a unique identity to me was thestory mode, it plays out like a Visual Novel until you come across trouble and have to fight your way through. The narrative is written very well with no linguistic errors (Engrish) and all dialogue said by any character is fully voiced and it is done absolutely well! You have the option to choose b/w English and Japanese voicesand although I would normally go with Japanese,BB's English cast seem so perfectly fit for it and do a great job. Each character has their own story which includes most of the other characters (if not all) andthere are at least 2 routes/endings to each story. There is also additional dialogue/extra sequences if you're defeated and sometimes it triggers an alternate route/ending. To reach 100% completion you have to lose & win against each opponent. Tip: Basic sequence is - save game>fight>lose (game over)>load game>fight>win>repeat for 100% story completion. The story itself can be very confusing at first, depending on the order of characters you play in story mode, but overall I love it! Synopsis is available in game description :/Characters:BB's weakness, as the beginning of a fighting game franchise, is the no. of available chars.There are 12 characters readily available to play with (including the boss/es), each very unique in design and fighting styles. Overall theme is very steampunk.The character relationships are interesting and show in-game during a fight(through dialogue & pre-battle sequences). Later installments of BB add a lot of characters as well as some additions to existing characters' attacks.Overall, I think the characters, their backgrounds and personalities, are more interesting than the main storyand they're sorta what make it what it is.Note: although later games have a lot more to offer, they kept changing artists for the character cards (what you see in the loading screen before a fight/the VS screen) and I think Calamity Trigger has the best artwork among all Blazblue titles. Noel Vermillion <3Chronos Phantasma is great too but Continuum Shift's art is the worst IMO, wish we could get BB:CP next :/Music:It's Badass!Aside from the main theme, ending credits theme ('Limited again', one of my faves), menu and whatnot, each character has their own fitting theme musicand if you set bgm to auto it will play the theme of your opponent (iirc, or the stage, I'm not too sure).The soundtrack is essentially a great mixture of heavy metal & orchestral musicand as it is downloaded with the game (in the directory), you can add it to your music library.Extras:There's a large gallery to unlock which includes concept art, character art, arcade end scenes & a few videos.You can also unlock 'unlimited mode' versions of characters by completing arcade which is a slightly powered up version of the character that you can set when selecting characters for vs battle(not sure about arcade battle). There is also a comedic story-like tutorial about BB's world accessible within story mode called ""Teach me miss Litchi"".BTW, I highly dislike this game's opening, mainly because the one on PSP was far better IMO.The PSP version's opening had the same video (second video up there) but used the arcade music from the first trailer up there on the store page (""Calamity Trigger""), it was so badass and much more fitting than this song(see on youtube)...I used to watch it everytime on PSP but I must skip it on PC.Special element:One of the best things about BB (IMO) is thespecial element of immersion in the game, characters are lively & have a lot of dialogue within a battle + unique dialogue for certain characters. There are also some special animations before a battle between some characters. This makes it more fun and interesting when you listen to their insults & comments while you fight. This adds tension and/or enjoyment to the already exciting battles. The normal dialogue in a fight also adds so much more, like characters saying ""Saw that!"" n ""Missed!"" when you dodge/block/counter.I just love how there's so much effort & personal touches put into this intoductory title.Peace."

Aside from the cartoon-like graphics, this game is honestly one of my favorite series for its expansive storyline, fast gameplay, and variety of characters to choose from. The game itself is pretty old considering about 2 more installments were made into the series after this, but the gameplay is still worthwhile and will still leave you wanting for more.I would give this game a 7/10 for its storyline and replayability, would reccomend"

Story is solid, but not much replayability if you don't have someone else to play with.Not much to bring in a novice player, and there's a pretty high learning curve for people not experienced in fighting games.The low price point is nice, but with newer versions out there and no real introduction/teaching modes for newer players, I can't really recommend this to anyone other than those curious about the story or if you really just want Blazblue on a PC platform."

First off, this version of the game does not have online play. This is also a game that you will want to have a controller to play, preferably two of them in case you want to play with a friend when you have them over. Finally,the last thing that new players should know is that the release of Blazblue Continuum Shift Extend makes this game obsolete due to the fact that it covers the storyline from both this game and the sequel while adding new characters."

However Just like GG isuka I got burned with a terrible port, no online play, lack of controller support for anything that isn't a 360 controller (it took me several hours of finicky work arounds just so I could use my logitech usb controller)  and a mass amount of confusion on why we got the insanely old version of this series.Due to GFWL shutting down (which this game was original for) it seems the developer just ported the game over to steam to make some more money off the title and instead of adding in a new netcode for online play they just stripped the feature completly. It is unknown at this time if purchasing this game will have any impact on whether or not future titles will come to pc and steam. One can hope But I will not being holding my breath.For 10 dollars you will get however a great story mode with fun loveable characters and the ability to play around with imo one of the best fighting systems out there. The game is fantastic and if it had some form of online play I would start gifting copies of this game, to my far away friends that is how much fun it is. You also get the soundtrack which is fantastic on its own and for the price it might even be worth it to you.I will recommend this game as for me I would have probably still purchased it knowning it didn't have online play attached, however for many of you this will be a deal breaker, and I would not recommend this game to you."

Those crazy Japs just gotta overachieve in everything. They count better, they're better at playing music, and of course they can write a stupidly insane story that's complex as ♥♥♥♥.But of course, the Japanese are also really weird. I mean, that's just how they are. It's in their culture. Like how each American is born with a gun clutched lovingly in their little baby arms.When all of the weird Japanese things come together to become an overwritten fighting game, what do we get? Blazblue.Originally in arcades, because Japan still has those, and later released on Xbox 360, PS3, PSP, and PC, Blazblue is the weird mix of fast-paced fighting and visual novel. The spiritual successor to Guilty Gear, Blazblue thrives on super complex mechanics and diverse, well-designed characters.This game's got everything, man. Incest, half-squirrel amine girls in schoolgirl outfits, cats that are actually biological weapons with♥♥♥♥♥♥ cats that are actually cats but they have sex with humans to create magical hybrid people, a milf with big♥♥♥♥♥♥and a tentacle fetish, a playable blob of tentacles, and a little girl that's actually a million year old vampire so she's actually completely legal.Yeah, she's like 7, but go right ahead. She's a vampire, it's okay. She's in elementary school, she's still learning basic math but she sucks blood so shove your♥♥♥♥♥♥in her. It's all cool, she's actually a million year old vampire. It's alright dude. Your Honor, I'm sorry, I just, I thought she was a vampire. So I'm free to go?Aside from being kinda creepy and fetish fuel on a whole lot of levels, Blazblue is a hell of a fighting game. By far one of the best I've played, despite having a smaller roster than most popular fighting games. Fast-paced, easy, and fun to just play. But its mechanics go super in-depth, and you can pull off some sick♥♥♥♥♥combos if you actually know what you're doing and you're not just mashing buttons randomly.There's only 12 characters to play as, but each one plays vastly different from the next. They each have their own sort of gimmick, a play-style that fits their personality and sets them apart from the other characters.For example, Big Sword Main Character is a gruff dickbag, and his weapon drains his health when he goes into super mode, so his play-style is very quick, brute force, and heavy hitting. He recovers health whenever his sword hits, so ideally you'd go into super mode and blitz your enemy with a bunch of heavy sword attacks to keep your health up and their health down.Other characters are similar. Preschool jailbait vampire is kind of an upper-class ♥♥♥♥♥, you know, she brings Lunchables to school. So she doesn't want to get her hands dirty in the sandbox. Her moves are generally ranged, and involve letting loose little minion-type projectiles to whale on you while she just sits there sipping her Caprisun like the ♥♥♥♥♥ she is.It's almost like, instead of just making a bunch of balanced, basic characters and maybe one with an unfair gimmick, they just gave every character an unfair gimmick. Everyone is overpowered. You can't ♥♥♥♥♥ about people playing one character because he's totally OP and impossible to beat, every character is pretty much that if played competently.I'm a robot with♥♥♥♥♥♥that can spawn magic swords out of nowhere? You're a blob of tentacles that moves in insane ways, gets crazy airtime, and can get 100+ combos with ease. I can freeze you solid? You're actually two characters being controlled by one. It's all fair, mang.Blazblue just manages to appeal to everything I like in fighting games. The artwork is gorgeous, the soundtrack is super kickass, the spritework and animation is smooth and visually pleasing, and it's just satisfying to watch and play. Combos are fun to execute, and you can finish with some badass super moves.But there's more to Blazblue than just♥♥♥♥♥♥and big swords. There's a Story Mode, which plays like a visual novel with some occasional fighting mixed in.Really, just a little fighting. Not too much. Like, maybe a round every couple paragraphs. No big deal, don't worry about getting your reading interrupted.There's a lot of story. A lot of ♥♥♥♥ing story. Like it's literally a book, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing book inside of a fighting game. It's a good book, don't get me wrong. Very nicely written. Compelling story and characters. But it's a ♥♥♥♥ing book. Each character has their own story to play through, detailing their intricate back-story and where they fit in with the Blazblue mythos.Their stories are at the very least interactive. You'll be offered a choice now and then. This path or that path. Fight this guy or don't. And choosing different paths will allow you to see more of each character and their story.I personally thought it worked, the writing is excellent and even witty at times. Lots of humor injected in here and there. Sometimes even entire story paths will be humor-oriented. The game takes itself seriously, but not too seriously. It's aware of how stupid it is at times, and it embraces that.Some story paths are actually hidden behind losing matches too, or winning matches with a finisher move. Which is nice, you know, having extra story. Unfortunately, losing matches is required for 100% completion. You'll need to play every story chapter twice at the very least, once to win and once to lose if you intend to get 100% and finish the game. Which is, you know, kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Sometimes the dialogue isn't even anything valuable or interesting, sometimes it's just ""oh no I'm dead"" and then the Game Over screen. Why the hell does that take up a precious 10% of my 100%? That's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, dude.If the story is your thing, there's a whole game worth of story here for you. There's literally a humorous little side story purely for the sake of trying to explain the batshit crazy story in an easier to grasp way. It can be a hassle, but there's so much for you to sink your teeth into. It's the kind of writing where you can tell it's definitely going somewhere, and there's a lot more planned in the mythos to flesh out, so you kind of have to analyze every little tidbit they share to try and figure out what's actually going on.If the fighting is more your thing, the standard Arcade mode will feature plenty of that, along with the basic structure of a story. So you can kind of figure out what's going on just by playing that also, though not to the same degree.As far as fighting games go, it's a fantastic story. It's not ""an evil organization is having a fighting tournament for like the fifth consecutive time, literally, and they're secretly doing some kind of evil science project at the same time as everyone is fighting"". There's much more substance to the plot.For a fighting game, there's a lot here and yet there isn't at the same time. There aren't 50+ characters with customizable movesets out of the box or anything like that. It's definitely a smaller title. But the amount of effort put into the world of Blazblue is clearly double that of an ordinary fighting game. It's definitely a must-play for any fighting game aficionado at the very least.Its charming cast of characters and overly complex writing and world won me over. I loved every second with Blazblue. It's definitely worth checking out just on its writing alone.And if nothing else, hey, if you don't like fighting games or reading, like any amine game there's always some pretty pictures to jack off to in here."

,Recommended,263300,13794046,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,Sigilbreaker,"I'm not usually one for fighting games, having only really played Super Smash Bros Brawl, but I was totally hooked by this one! Intuitive but deep is the only way I can describe the combat, and the small but diverse roster and good backstory helps a lot as well.Core Gameplay:Pretty solid, with moves that fluidly turn into combos; I'm playing with just a keyboard, which is probably not the recommended setup, but I'm still doing fine. The simplicity of the game is really helpful; no enviroments to get in your way, just two combantants duking it out. The seperation of the ""drive"" - one of the most often used abilities - into a seperate key is the cornerstone of the easy to learn, hard to master fighting system in the game.Character RosterTwelve is a pretty small roster for a fighting game, but a fantastic point is the game's favour is that there are no clones; each character fights in a totally different style befitting their personality and powers. My favourite, Jin, keeps his opponents at a short distance using ice projectiles before freezing them and moving in for the attack. Carl, on the other hand, uses his robot sister as both a shield and a catspaw to catch an opponent off guard. You're sure to find the one right for you!Aesthetics/GraphicsThe designs in this game are some gorgeous 2D stuff, no mistake, but if you have an aversion to anime and anime-like designs for backgrounds and characters this game will turn you off; it subscribes to many, many anime conventions. However, the bold stylistic choice results in a very diverse group of character designs; they look distinct, in both clear and subtle ways. For example, Taokaka,  Iron Tager and Arakune look totally different, coming from various backgrounds. On the other hand, Noel and Jin wear similar uniforms (both belonging to a military called the NOL) but are easily told apart on the battlefield due to minor but well placed differences in how they wear it, no mean feat.Story and Story ModeAs with the designs, the story is very anime-ish; it is presented piece-meal, but after playing through several different perspectives (which, incidentally, is a good way to become familiar with the roster) you start to get a handle on it. Really, the powderkeg personalities of the roster are the key here. I found myself liking even characters like Taokaka and Bang, who I initially thought ridiculous, because their individual stories are told with humour and pathos. Of course, not everyone is guarenteed to be likable (I can not bring myself to bear Noel and her constant whining) but odds are you'll find a horse to back in this very confusing and at times incomprehensible plot.The best thing is how gameplay and story co-incide! Characters will offer voice clips when they fight each other relating to the situation and how they view the other person; this is amazing for building atmosphere. It can range from simply recognising the opponent as an agent of a rival faction like Sector Seven or the NOL, to calling them a pet name, to swearing at them or giggling psychotically at their pain.The bosses (by which I mean the two ""hidden characters"", who you will likely face on your first runthrough of any story) can be very difficult, especially if you're using someone you're not familiar with. However, they never feel impossible or super-cheap.ConclusionI've still got a lot to do on this game, and I hope they add acheivements and maybe even steam-supported netplay, but for its low price tag and taking into account single player and local multiplayer, I encourage you to give it a shot, especially if you're interested into starting out in fighting games!The Wheels of Fate are Turning..."

The gameplay itself is standard acceptable fighter fair, which is relatively accessible, the 4 button setup for different movesets and the relative easy of blocking and initiating combos allow you to jump in....however chaining and more complex setups take a long while to master. The fighting all the same is rewarding. The real reason you should play this game however isn't the fighting mechanics or the unique feel of the fighters (different unique playstyles) but rather for the story and personalities of the cast. The game does an excellent job in its storytelling having branching ""choose your own ending"" style gameplay for each of the characters, and locking the true ending...which is ultimately based on the sum of the individual stories behind completing the game as each character. By the time you finally get to game's end you will have a good understanding of the BlazBlue universe and have enjoyed multiple conclusions which are oddly canon (play the game....you will get it). So in summary, as far as stories go, for a fighting game, BlazBlue has arguably the best, and as the first installment, I fully recommend playing this game before moving on to others in the series. That being said this game does have some optimization bugs so be warned in that respect."

They include some key features, such as a good amount of Resolution options, Anti Aliasing, Bloom and sound options. Its a sprite based fighting game, so there isnt really that much to change when it comes to the visual options.The framerate is quite off though. My PC is not exactly top tier, but its definetly not low tier either. Mid tier, ive gotten drops to 45FPS which is really bad in a fighting game. Other than that, the game usually runs at a solid 60FPS.The game also doesnt handle Alt+Tabbing out of the game that well, as ive seen the sprites bugging out by doing so. This can range from completely dissapearing  or the colours being completely off.There is no online, though i personally dont feel this matters. Calamity Trigger is an old game, and the balance is VERY off. Multiple characters has 1 hit kill combos/setups, so going online you probably wouldnt be having that much of a good time.The game does allow for Local 1v1, so if you want to play with friends, there is that option.The Story is good. Its done in a Visual Novel style, and should take about 10-20 hours to go through, depending on how much of a completionist you are.It does have ""Supposed to lose"" fights, so in a few fights you actually fail when you win. The game also has some fights which require a ""Distortion Finish"" which is basically requires you to win with a Super move. Both of these got changed in the later installments of the series, except for a select few matches where distortion/Astral finish was required.Id say, if you buy this game, dont buy it for a Fighting Game solely. Buy it if you are interrested in the story of Blazblue and possibly want to see the rest of the games ported to PC. As a fan of the series, id say its worth it. You also get the soundtrack which is amazing. Its a mix between Instrumental Rock and Vocal remixed versions of the instrumental songs(Lyrics are in Japanese)."

You can buy the game only if you want to see how the first game looked like and how much has changed.But the game itself is a 6/10 the story if really thin and is pretty short compared with the other game and the other modes like arcade and versus are just the same as in the other games of this series.

The only weird thing about it is where Guilty Gear everyone's 'style' is the big difference, in this every character has some kind of wonky mechanic going on, either an extra meter or a different one or their dust attacks do a special thing, etc.The story mode is not to be overlooked though. I like how they're building the setting for this one, even if I'm progressing through it fairly slowly. The marraige of visual novel and fighting game is not at this stage an excellent one but it's interesting thus far. The story is WAY in media res so figuring out setting details as we go is actually kind of nice. This, as far as I know, is the first installment, so you're not missing anything if the first run or so through doesn't answer all your questions, you just have to hammer through more of them.Overall, not bad, just different enough from GG and still bringing something neat to the table."

I have played many fighters over the years using a keyboard (from the original PC ports of Street Fighter II, Mortal Kombat Triliogy and Mortal Kombat 4 in the 90s to Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter X Tekkan and obviously BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger here in 2014, and BlazBlue has the PERFECT design for players who don't have a gamepad."

The 2 player local  co-op can be a bit clustered at times if your using a keyboard, but if you have two controllers then the game is easier for  both players to enjoy. The best part of the games combat system is that it has a varity of ways for to make combo's to combine with special unique cinematic moves that gives you a good feeling after performing it in the game. The story line of the game is divided into 14 parts each with one of the games playable characters, combined overall the storyline takes about a good 5 hours to finish all together. Lastly there is arcade mode the last playable part of the game where you wanna focus on, but first let me say that the arcade mode of the game is EXCATLY the same as arcade port of the game you see in large arcades or in japan in general. The main thing that beating arcade mode with do for you is unlock a astral heat unique to each character in the game with some exceptions like Ragna which is unlocked by default. So yeah the game is lengthy enough to enjoy when you have nothing else to do but I will say the game is easily forgotten when the newer fighter games come out and take its place and sooner or later there will be no point to come back unless you wanna play story mode to understand the story background of this game to latest game in its series."

Most games in this style just demand that the player keep pressing buttons to win, or keep spaming the same movements over and over again. This is not the case here. The learning curve of Calamity Trigger is not easy, but it's certainly rewarding.You have 12 characters to play from, and to some, this may be a small amount to play with. But the thing here is that you don't have two characters who have a similar style. Everyone has different fighting mechanics, and certainly, one of them will become your favorite:You have Ragna the Bloodedge, who fights with both his giant sword, and using his fists and kicks, and is able to drain life from his opponent when he uses his Azure Grimmoire. There is Jin Kisaragi, who have a sword similar to a katana, and has ice powers. There is Noel Vermillion, who uses two giant pistols. There is Rachel Alucard, who is similar to a lady doll from the noble parts of society, who uses his shapeshifting cat and his sidekick to move graceously in the battlefield. Use her special movement (Those are called Distortion Drive in this game) early in the battle, and you will probably miss, but try to spread Lighting Rods and then using the Distortion, and all of them will get energized by the movement. Some of the characters even use their Heat Gauge (Used to make Distortion Drives) differently from other characters, and this variety of gameplay is one of the things that makes this franchise killer, not mentioning all the counter movements, throws, defensive maneuvers and ways to even use your Heat Gauge to extend combos.The story is another major point of this game. You have 10 character's story mode to complete. Two of them are not included. In each campaign, you have different routes in the story based on some dialog choices, and even losing specific battles will not result in Game Over, rather opening another path to go on. Even the way you finish your battles may alter the route. Every character's story mode has a percentage of completion, and to get 100%, you will need to see every possible outcome. This way, you will be able to reach the true ending of that character's campaign...but does that mean the other ones are alternative endings? Check to story and draw your own conclusions.In Calamity Trigger, you basically have the Story, Versus, Score Attack and Arcade modes. In the Arcade, you will choose one character to defeat 10 others, and in specific encounters, you will even have a dialog. It's a simple game mode, but not short of surprises. Some interesting rewards await those who complete it.The game is completely dubbed, both in japanese and english, and has subtitles as well. I didn't play in English, but the Japanese one is awesome, as expected.The only let-down is that it has no online mode, but trust me, you will spend dozens of hours in this game if you want to take the most of it.Finally, it has one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard. It's a mix of classical music and heavy metal, and if you're into that style of music, you will be delighted. Best of all, you will get the full digital OST in MP3 buying this.That said, Blazblue: Calamity Trigger is recommended both to the ones who enjoy an awesome fighting game, and to those you're just getting started in that genre. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.PS - INFERUNÔ DIVAIDAHHHH!"

It can be a bit confusing because occasionally the story mode requires you to replay characters' story and take a different path or lose certain fights. But all in all it's a great start to an awesome and addictive saga.EDIT: put co-op instead of multiplayer, also it's definitely worth mentioning that this game comes with a free soundtrack, so if you enjoy the music as much as I do, you'll enjoy having this on your phone/iPod/MP3"

Never played the actual game until now, but I had Bang, Tager, Rachel, Noel, and Ragna for MUGEN, so I was curious to see where they were from. How is the game? Surprisingly good for a 2D 1v1 fighter. I never got into games like Mortal Combat and Street Fighter because they didn't seem very interesting. You didn't know much about the characters, they all looked the same, and they just seemed like something you would just play at a friends house.(note that not all of these statements are neccessarily true, because I never did play them) BlazBlue, however, focuses on only twelve characters, which is small for a fighting game roster in this day and age. Because of this, they all look different, all use different tactics, and all play differently, with a few extreme examples. You've got Ragna, the all-rounder and face of the game, a man who wears a trenchcoat-shaped cliche and wields a big sword, Noel, who uses dual pistols which behave unlike most pistols I've seen, V-13, which is somehow pronounced 'Nu', who animates eight floating blades for attack and defense, and Taokaka, a cat-person with massive claws and some truly impressive speed. These all use the same controls and are usable by pretty much everyone to good effect. But then you've got Akumen and Rachel, who play completely differently. Add to this variety a story mode for each character, and you've got something I didn't expect from this genre. Other than the story mode, there's a versus mode, training mode, Arcade mode, Score attack, and that's it.The art design is consistently interesting, and all the stages are distinct from each other. Music is pretty good, but nothing standout. Gameplay wise, it's pretty balanced. A few characters have really powerful attacks that are balanced by their completely different playstyles, which lends the characters variety without making some of them overpowered.Overall, it's a fun game, and it's only ten bucks. I recommend it."

Story is pretty hard to understand until you play all the routes of every character (so this means you have to replay the same character two or three more times to get 100% and also save often!). Since its a visual novel, expect lots of text to read.Sprites are also 720p, i would strongly recommend to set the resolution to 1280x720p either arcade or full. The only downside, there is a 30fps bug. To resolve this problem just reboot your computer.However, if you are going to buy this game remember that the online BB community is on the latest blazblue game, which would be Chronophantasma Extend.

I've spent more hours on BBCT than I have in Skullgirls & that's approaching 1000 before too long...However, it must be noted this is the very first Blazblue (BB) game and there've been 2 full versions after. Currently, Blazblue Chhrono Phantasma is the game to play & there's been a campaign to get it on steam. After a week of the campaign, Blazblue CT (this game) magically appeared on steam. No advertising...no real announcements or nothing. So that has to mean something. Mind you, the game was already ported to PC a while ago, but it was 1-2 years after the original and the 2nd game had already come out, making it obsolete & furthermore, really effed up because of ""Games for Windows Live"" DRM.In this new steam revision, they removed GFWL (THANK GOD), but at the time of this review, there's no netplay.

,Recommended,263300,9309981,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,ZenTori,"While I've been a fan of this series ever since my friend told me about it a couple years ago, I never actually played any of the games due to not having a PS3 or an Xbox 360. I know that this game was on PC over in the UK and on GFWL and such, but I never bothered to get that since I didn't feel like it was worth it, not to mention the price. So when I saw this on steam, I jumped at the chance. I DID take a look at the steam information on this game and I still bought it. So let's get on with the good and the bad.Pros:-Graphics. I really like the sprites and detailed backgrounds in the stages. I'm not the sort of guy who thinks games are only as good as their graphics. Not at all. But the game's graphics is a plus for me.-Awesome music. I think everyone already knows that pretty much every game has at least some good music. Fighting games generally have awesome music. You get the OST when you buy this game and it's so worth it.-Length. I've played 9.6 hours as of this review, and I'm not even halfway done with the story. The story has branching paths depending on whether you win, lose, win with a distortion/astral heat, or choose different options in the story when the choice arises (There's a guide in the community hub to help you get 100% on all character's stories). There's only three characters that have an astral heat when you first start the game. To get the others, you have to beat arcade mode with the character you want the astral heat for. You can also unlock Unlimited mode for characters, which just makes them more powerful, by having more speed, power, modified distortions, etc. That also adds a bit more to the length. Beside that, there's also score attack to do and the gallery to complete if you wanted to do those things.-Price. You get all of this for $10. I think I got like at least $20 worth from playing some of the character's stories and listening to the OST alone.Cons:-No online play. For me, I don't really care too much that this game doesn't have online versus. I know that fighting games are really all about playing against someone else and most places don't have a local fighting scene. However I will say that online play is never recommended for top play. It's fine for beginner-intermediate play, but there's always some sort of latency that to play extremely competitively online in a fighting game is sort of absurd. But while I don't care too much that it's offline only, I still would've liked to see it have online. H2 Interactive might be able to implement it in the future.-Bugs. This is a straight port of the GFWL version, so all the bugs on there are also on here. Sometimes your game will be locked at 30 FPS if your computer's been on for a while. This can easily be fixed with a restart. When I first started the game, the FPS was actually locked at around 17 FPS, but again restarting my computer fixed that. There's also a bug for some people where story mode does not have music at all. If you alt+tab out of the window and come back in, sometimes the characters' sprites will be invisible or have weird hitbox colors. These can usually be fixed if you alt+tab again or have the sprites change (either by hitting, getting hit, or anything else that changes the sprites). Same thing happens in story mode's cutscenes. Alt+tabbing will usually make the character completely invisible, or partly invisible, and the only way for that to be fixed is if the character moves somehow due to an event in the story. But it'll only happen for that one scene you alt+tabbed out of. It may also crash on certain parts, I've read about how some people are crashing after clearing score attack but I haven't played that mode yet.-Controller support. Despite it saying Full controller support, it only fully supports Xbox controllers and anything using Xbox. My PS2 controller doesn't work, but my Madcatz TE Xbox 360 stickdoes work. For any other controllers, you'll have to find a way to emulate the Xbox 360 controller or maybe use one of those controller mapping programs. I have no experience with those so I'm just glad I got an Xbox 360 stick instead of a PS3 one (Though I would very much like to have one still).-Not entirely beginner-friendly. There's absolutely no tutorial on what you can do. Thereisa manual if you right click the game and read it (but who really does that? I didn't even know about it until I right clicked it once). So you'll have to either go into training mode and test out your things or read a guide or something. Basically each character has a light attack, medium attack, and heavy attack, recognized as A, B, and C respectively. Each character also has a Drive attack, recognized as D. Every single attack also has a forward+ action, so if you hold forward and press A, B, C, or D, you'll do a different attack than just pressing A, B, C, or D by itself. Same thing for in the air, though I believe it depends on certain characters. Arakune, for example, has a down+A/B/C attack in the air. Pressing A+B at the same time gives you a barrier block, which is different from a normal block, obviously. There's also an instant block and instant barrier block, if you block about 8 frames before an attack connects. B+C is your grab attack. A+B+C consumes 50 heat, and allows you to cancel a move. A+B+C+D is your burst, which lets you get out of a combo. Not recommended to use early in the round, since you won't have a barrier gauge and will be in Danger status until the round ends. However, definitely recommended if you're supposed to lose in story mode to get a certain scene or path.Overall, I would still recommend this game. If you have never played a BlazBlue game but wanted to, I'd say go for it. If you want to experience the story, go for it. If you want to get familiar with BlazBlue games, go for it (Although each new game changes something). Despite the cons, I still really enjoyed the game and will enjoy it for many more hours to come. The story and OST alone are worth the $10, I'd say."

Then it’s time to throw down with BlazBlue:Calamity Trigger, the oldest version of the over-the-top heavy metal fighting franchise from Arc System Works. BlazBlue’s combat system encourages you to play as offensively as possible with a plethora of aggressive tools, so the action rarely slows. Characters can dash, air dash, high jump, double jump, jump cancel, and defensive roll, all in the name of getting close and dishing out punishment.

The visuals are nice, the controls are intuitive, and the extensive story mode makes for some entertaining reading. All of the fundamentals are in place. Nonetheless, Arcsys pushed this game out during a time when they legally couldn't make Guilty Gear games, and as a result, everything about this game smacks of a poor man's Guilty Gear. Anyone saying it isn't fair to compare the two series is delusional. Both games are the exact same flavor of fighter, but BlazBlue performs just a step below its sibling series in most regards. Every character on the roster is some transparent Bizarro World counterpart of someone from Guilty Gear. The music is the same metal style, but the melodies aren't as catchy aside from tunes that too closely resemble Guilty Gear pieces. The story is entertaining, but not as interesting. And the lack of online multiplayer in a PC port is a fault too glaring to omit. The overall gameplay, however, does manage to be on par with Arcsys's flagship fighter. Don't confuse my intentions; BlazBlue: CT is a good game in its own right. This brings me to my point: The developers didn't need to borrow so much from Guilty Gear. If you like the developer's other fighting offerings, you'll like this one, because it's almost the exact same thing. Arcsys would have done better to capitalize on the opportunity to create a more unique series, but instead, they came out with BlazBlue: Totally Not Guilty Gear, Sega."

I knew very well Calamity Trigger had a PC release and I do believe that the sequel Continuum Shift also had a PC release. The only one that I believe didn't was Continuum Shift Extend and Chrono Phantasma definitely did not have a PC release. What can I say? Blazblue is a superb fighting game. It has a vast amount of content in it for both offline and online. You have story where you play through each character with branch paths leading to a good ending/true ending or even a silly/parody ending. Then you got arcade that also has its own branch story that somewhat sums the story in a nutshell (sort of). Sure its sequels add a few new characters to play as but its story continues and it gets even more interesting. Blazblue probably is the most in-depth fighting game out there with an in-depth story. I had to even look up the wiki to fully understand it. The character personaliteis are all unqiue. You have basicaly every sort of anime-stereotype there. The hard-boiled load mouth protagonist, the cold, (sometimes) sadisitic brother who is also a protagonist. You got a klutzy girl who is not fully modiviate. A cat-mutant girl who is known to be part of the Kaka clan who loves ""meat buns"" from ""boobies lady"". And so much more. I have hopes they will release more of its sequels upon this one.

A fighting game.The gameplay is nice - it's really my cup of tea when fight can be entertaining even for newbies - special combos are easy to perform (mostly), the most specials are cool looking. At the same time, the difficulty can be varied from ""casually easy"" to ""I broke my gamepad"", which is pleasant to have.The story of this fighting game is amazing. Really, the story and characters aren't something you usually expect from a fighting game - from any game, actually. I was charmed by the universe of the game.In addition, game's soundtrack is beautiful. It's themed for every character and some special fights and, actually, nicely fit them. Now I'm using it in my playlist.Unfortunately, you need a real friend to play with - there's no internet play (curse GFWL!).Well, that's my positive comment. I am also wathced the anime, based ON this game, so... yeah, I'm a great fan of this game.Want other games of the seria to be ported. Want it so badly... ugh."

I'm happy to see it finally has a pc port on steam.The roster: The character roster is relatively small (12 characters), however they all have a unique fighting style to them. It's noticable they put a lot of effort into every character.Single Player: There is a story mode for every playable character with some dialogue in between the fights. Besides that there's the usual arcade, versus and practice modes.Multiplayer: The network function did not get ported over. So no multiplayer as of yet.All in all it's a definite buy for someone who enjoys 2D fighters and wants to see more of them on pc, especially for the price on steam (€8,99 or your regional equivalent).Still not convinced to give it a try? Fine, but you're making Taokaka sad...""Tao's wasting away and you just walk off?! You monster...! You demon...! You...you...DOG-PERSON!"""

She's just so cute of a cat / human hybrid. And the most importantly, the gameplay! It plays like an average fighting game, but with tons of anime paint on it. The controls were not too bad, although playing with a controller would probably be a better idea, it felt smooth at best. And I loved every single part of the game.

There's no online play, which takes away most of the fun of the fighter, and there's a lot of balancing issues that make it even difficult for couch-play.It's also really hard to recommend it to someone totally new because CT's story isn't even that great. A lot of it is filler and doesn't really expand onto the universe. CS can summarize the plot just fine at the start.Basically, it's a buggy, unbalanced, stripped version of the original that isn't worth most peoples  time.

Something that BlazBlue lacks is a large selection of characters (there are 12 in total). Though, because of that, every single character has their own unique fighting style and personality. The pace of this game is just right and the characters are somewhat balanced once you get a grip of their combos/attacks. BlazBlue's soundtracks are also great, more than that; they're included when you buy this game!This game features a story mode which requires you to play through all character's story to unlock more content. It's basically a visual novel. With that said, there are different paths you can take which leads to different endings.Surprisingly the story of this game was quite deep (complex?) and far more what I've expected. It was quite entertaining and it did add a lot more value to the game. The voice acting for some characters however (like Ragna) was terrible, while others (Rachel) was really good.And of course, there is an arcade mode as well!If you're new to this genre, watch a gameplay of this game. That's probably the best way to find out if this is a game for you (there are no gameplay videos in the store page).I personally don't really care about online mode, thus I did not take it inconsideration when I made this into one of my recommended games.

These are the people who made Guilty Gear, so yeah.THE PROBLEM:The big problem with this game is not with the game itself, it's with the port. What can be said for this port is it's terrible, it's really not good enough.It's really disappointing and leaves the game vastly inferior to the console version.The way they've set up the fighting for keyboard is ridiculous and I suggest you get a controller hooked up. Some menus you can't even go back from and you'll have to force the game to close, then relaunch it. There's no online versus mode in this port.There are huge glaring problems with this port.HOWEVER!I'm willing to accept this. Later games in the franchise already improved on the game so Calamity Trigger is a little outdated in comparison. And here is why I think you should buy this.For the sake of sequels. Show that there's an interest for this franchise to come to PC. This one doesn't cost much, and to me it shows this more of a product to test out the waters. If we show interest in this they'll probably invest more in a better team to port the sequels to PC (maybe fix this one) and just do this classic justice.I can only speak well of BlazBlue and it frustrates me to see so many's first impression ruined by this port. Hate the port, don't hate the game and developers.I've just come to love this game's style and its characters. In a way it's probably one of the most sophisticated and true fighting games in my opinion, all mechanically. The soundtrack is by the genius Daisuke Ishiwatari and it's amazing!Very visually appealing and has some great voice acting for its kind, even in the English dub. It also scores some bonus points for sharing some voice actors with League of Legends. (fx. Noel - Riven, Hazama - Wukong, Tager - Garen)It runs with sprite animations and it may not be what people are used to but it works just fine.You don't really have to like anime to get into this I'd say, but if you're not into anime you may have to extend you tolerance quite a bit. It's story involves alot of space/time continuum and may be hard to follow but it's really good.Maybe I'm wearing pink heart-shaped glasses here... I just really love this game's style.Damn, I hope they release the rest on Steam. Let's keep a lookout for Continuum Shift and Chrono Phantasma!"

Overall, good game and good first impression of ASW.Long story short, I'm a big fan of Arc System's works (ba dum tish) and this game is most likely my favorite. Simple yet creative character designs, great gameplay when your controller isn't broken, and an easy-to-get-into story that actually makes some sense in comparison to other games of the genre (I'm looking at you, Tekken's drawn-out dry storyline).TL;DR: is a good game, I like"

I am leaving this review up anyway, but CSE makes a better entry point into the series with Calamity Trigger being an additional purchase for those who want to experience the alternate routes.Blazblue features a great sci-fi story told via visual novel sections interspersed with the best 2D fighter gameplay I've ever experienced.The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world in which society has already been rebuilt and futuristic tech that runs off magic has been developed. The lore is quite complicated, but most of it is explained in the non-canon ""Teach Me, Miss Litchi"" segments, which consist of light-hearted skits performed by super-deformed versions of the game's main characters. Having the lore explanations separate from the main game allows for the main storylines to move at a decent pace. However, in Calamity Trigger the ""Teach Me, Miss Litchi"" segments are unlocked as you play the game, so you may end up completely lost while playing the main story. As for tone, there is a serious story in the game that is told in a serious manner, but there is also an abundance of humour and gag routes in the series.The actual gameplay seems to cater to both hardcore competitive fighter fans and unskilled casual players (like me). Combos are easy to pull off and flow together well, all the special moves have simple inputs and can even be mapped to a single button/key/analogue stick flick, and the easy difficulty is rather easy. There's more that appeals to the hardcore crowd, but as this version lacks online play, said people are better off with the console version, which they would likely already own. I had a hard time with hard difficulty and some normal fights, so there may be a challenge to be had for those who want one, but not as much of a challenge as you could have against human players.The PC version seems to play just as well as the console versions, but lacks online play, so it's vs. computer and local play only. The included soundtrack features a lot of metal, but also has some symphonic rock. There are 42 tracks, but some short audio clips such as the ""[character] vs. [character]"" screen music is included, so it's more like 34 songs.Highly recommended, unless Continuum Shift Extend is an option, as that contains a condensed version of Calamity Trigger's story complete with most of the memorable fights as well as minor beneficial tweaks, the entirety of Continuum Shift, and a few extra story routes not found elsewhere."
,Recommended,263300,9094903,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,EUGENE V. DABS,This is a legit port.  The only real issues are the lack of online multiplayer and the fact that it only likes xinput controllers. Totally worth it for under a tenner
,Not Recommended,263300,11002133,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,Smallcrits,"Let's face it. This game is an outdated, badly ported, mess of a title. After following the examples of how to make this game run decently, I would still suggest that it isn't worth $10 on Steam. Buy it on console if you are interested. It will actually work and probably cost less.Once the game is downloaded, it locks you into around 30fps. If you are even a mediocre fighting game player, you will know that that is a dealbreaker. There are also the lag spikes you would normally see from a bad console to PC port that is all too common on steam. The second deal breaker is that this title is very outdated in format. There is a reason developers put out new, updated titles in a franchise like fixing the engine, not just to make money. An outdated format brings me to the last deal breaker, there is no online. Some of us, me included, bought Clamity trigger just to have a blazblue game to play since I do not own a console. No online isn't a fatal fault, but a fault nonetheless.I would also rather not suggest people buy the game just in hope of better ports and updated titles to the franchise. Why show support for Arc when they have shown how little effort they are willing to put into a port already? I would much prefer donating to a fundraising campaign with the incentive of a decent port so that there is some form of obligation to make a good product by the developers. I will not give a hollow smile and say ""Good effort out there! You will do better next time I'm sure."" What I hope is that this was just a prototype for Arc to practice on and that the next titles will be actually playable."

I've been a huge fan of the series since I first played this game on PS3. I currently own Blazblue Continuum Shift (EXTEND) on my PS Vita and it's one of my favorite games of all time. I am extremely excited to see this game released here on Steam!However, I must be honest. As much as I love this game, this is a extremely straightforward port of the console versions. A Gamepad is a MUST to enjoy this game properly, as keyboard and mouse controls just don't work for fighting games of this sort. I am admittendly disappointed by the lack of online multiplayer. However, this version of the game does still support local co-op play. Perhaps even more impressive is the inclusion of the GAMES ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK which is included with this Steam release. As Blazblue has one of the most impressive soundtracks in any video game, fighting or otherwise, this alone pretty much justifies the purchase unless you can track down the fairly elusive CD.Blazblue is a traditional 2D Japanese fighting game with a emphasis on fast, dynamic combat and tactical strategy. The fighting is extremely dependent on precise timing and mastery of skills. There are several difficulty levels ranging from 'casual' to 'nightmarishly hard', and this allows players of all skill levels to jump in and enjoy playing the game. There is also a in-depth training mode which will walk you through each character's moveset and learn basic gameplay mechanics.In addition, there is also a standard 'Arcade mode' in which you fight increasingly difficult opponents to win. A 'Story mode' which takes each character through their own unique storyline, and a 'verses' mode where you can challenge your friends in local co-op matches.Blazblue: Calamity Trigger is a fantasic game and worthy of anyone's gaming collection. I recommend buying this edition if only for the elusive Offical soundtrack and it's a decent port of the console versions.Highly recommended! (Unless you own one of the console versions...)"

In fact, it was this game and Soul Cailibur IV that compelled me to purchase my PS3 in the first place. Buying this game on steam is just a walk down memory lane, giving me a sense of nostalgia. Comparing this to the current iteration, Chrono Phantasma, I can see and appreciate all of the changes. Gone are the overly complicated inputs of certain Astral Finishes (720 D for CT Jin vs 632146 D for CP Jin). Gone are the ice car spams, etc.This game however, lacks a online multiplayer feature. This is a huge detriment as it is a fighting game, a game where it is most enjoyable when you pit your skills against another live opponent. Sure Hell mode Unlimited Hakumen is tough, but it is predictable, where as the human element isnt.On the plus side though, they allow you to have the unlimited versions of all of the characters (assumption based on having Noel's and Jin's), unlike the original game where they only had unlimited versions of Ragna, Hakumen, Rachel and Nu.Story wise, I haven't touched it at all as I have already completed it before and the nightmares of losing on purpose just to unlock hidden routes still haunt me (the later iterations have fixed this). Its quite interesting. Maybe it would interest fans of the anime.All in all, i think its a good game. However, the later versions are much better.

Thank you and have fun.I've played the original BlazBlue on Xbox (Arcade) and I love it that they did a remake on that game (or more like a PC port). My expections were pretty high and I didn't get dissapointed!But first thing first:-> Spoiler warning for the story! If you haven't played the ""real ending"",skip to the next arrow!-The Story:There isn't really much of a story... it's a tournament fighter like Street Fighter,what do you expect? Oh well,here's the Story: Ragna and his brother Jin were normal boys who lived in a church/an orphanage with nuns. One day the building started to burn and Ragna quickly noticed it (He was in the Woods BTW). As he retuned,Jin was standing there,telling him that he's the reason this happened. At first he didn't understand,but then it was too late. Jin cut off Ragna's arm. Now we're skipping ahead at least 10 years. Ragna's grown up and wants to get revenge for his arm and the nuns Jin had killed. On his way to Jin he met some people and most of em' wanted his ""Azure Grimoire"", wich is giving him Demon like powers. At the NOL HQ,the meets Jin to finally settle the score, but they were interrupted when a gate opened,that connected the ""Real World"" to the ""Under World"". There he met V-13,a robot like girl who says that she's his sister. In the final cutscene, Rachel Alucard uses a spell with wich she's trying to close the gate. Of course, it didn't work-> Spoiler free Arrow right here!And thats the whole story! Of course, it's incomplete. It's getting more complete in the 2nd game,Continuum Shift,wich will be soon available on Steam. Overall the story is Ok.-The Characters:This is an interessting thing to talk about. You have 11 playable characters. Those would be ""Ragna the Bloodedge"",""Bang Shishigami"",""Jin Kisaragi"",""Noel Vermillion"",""Carl Clover"",""Rachel Alurad"",""Taokaka"",""Litchi Faye-Ling"",""Arakune"",""V-13"" and ""Hakumen"",Each with differen attack speeds and Distortion Finishes. And that's really a shame. Don't get me wrong,I like the characters, but in what minds did they think to leave out Hazama??? He is one of,if THE, coolest characters in this entire game! But he's only an NPC... at least he's playable in Continuum Shift.-The Gamemodes:That's a simple one. There are only some modes. Story,Arcade and Online. There are the most important ones and the only ones.-The Gameplay:This game plays as you would expect it to. There's a light,medium and heavy attack button,Special attack buttons, Combos for Distortion Finishes (ect.). If you've ever played any fighting game like Street Fighter or Tekken,you know how to play BlazBlue!There's nothing more to say to this I guess... Moving on!-The Graphic:Oh my god, the graphic... It's so beautiful. All characters look like they belong in an Anime, the intro cutscene and some other cutscenes are drawn (Animestyle) and the backgrounds are not just ""there"", they feel alive because something's allways happening! If you're a fan of Anime,you're gonna like the visuals of this game,bright and shiny on one side, dark and kinda scary on the other. A perfect mix!-The Music:I've saved the best for last!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8pKHTS0nh8THIS says everything I need to say. The music a AWSOME! It's Powerfull,Epic and most importantly remindable. If I think about BlazBlue, the song that always comes to my mind would be Taokakas theme. It's so happy and *Derp* at the same time...It's perfect for Taokaka.All in all,this game ROCKS! You should DEFINATLY,DEFINATLY buy this game! C'mon! Buy it allready! Go ahead!My final Score for this game is 10/10 Points. It's simply a masterpiece.Heeeeey,you made it to the end! Thanks for reading my Review of BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger! Hope you liked it!!!"

Ragna the Bloodedge, a main character with a name somehow stupider than Sol Badguy, looks like an anime character merged with a matryoshka doll. You could shuck ten layers off this character and still not get to the actual man beneath. Every anime trope is piled on these characters in order to make them memorable, and a similar concept has been followed with the game's combat.The Drive button is an interesting idea. I can see how it evolved into the P4A persona attacks. But here, it creates a combat system that is equal parts chaotic and clunky. I fully admit to scrub status; I am not particularly GOOD at Blazblue. But that is irrelevant here; I'm terrible at 3rd Strike, I'm terrible at P4A, I'm terrible at friggin Skullgirls; but it doesn't impact my enjoyment of the game.With only local co-op available, the AI's gotta stand up. And it just doesn't. Set it to highest difficulty, pick Officer Moe, and spam Down+D. Oh, look what happened. PERFECT.Is it? Is itreally?Main takeaway? People like to play fighting games for a lot of reasons, and the big two for me are the feel of the combat, and the design of the characters. And in both cases, Arcsys seems to have taken the approach of ""throw stuff at a wall and see what sticks.""What they didn't realize is that the wall was sticky. Very sticky.Forreasons.Lookin' at you, Faye-Ling."

The gameplay for me which can consider a strength by other players is the fighting brawler genre. I came for the story, but left due to the gameplay. Looking in my library, the closest game I can compare it with is Skullgirls and Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst. Like Skullgirls, I like the story of BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger, but am unable to love the fighting brawler type of gameplay it has. On the other hand, Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm strike a perfect match between fighting brawler, open world, and story.Nevertheless, BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger has strong points that would appeal to players who are interested in this genre."

Characters all feel very different so you can easily pick your favouriteGraphics:Characters look great and the 3D stage backgrounds have a lot of detail in them, however you will probably fare better with the default resolution that your native resolution fot your monitor, because the game when scaled improperly looks like crap.Also 31 fps cap is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tSounds and Music:Sound quality isn't that great compared to the console versions and the english voice acting is a little glitched, but the japanese voice acting sounds gorgeous and the soundtrack of this game will rock your socks and underwear off!Overall:great game but still would recommend buying the PS3 or Xbox360 version, because the game looks and sounds better and it has online play, hope Arc system works will fare better with future ports of Continuum Shift and Chrono Phantasma."

(More Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, and maybe Persona4Arena PC?)Essentially the GFWL version now without GFWL, the Steam version now lacks Online and apparently still suffers from the same issues.Being the first entry of the series, Calamity Trigger is a bit simpler than the other combo heavier sequels and revisions (characters being given more move set options) but all 3 main entries in the series try different balance mechanics that make them play a bit different. With Dashes, a Parry system, Barrier blocking, a simple ""revolver"" combo system (A > B > C > D move links) and Cancel options, the pacing can get pretty hectic in BlazBlue.Aside from the PC versions (Steam and Windows 8 Store), I've only played the PSP version of Calamity Trigger and the Steam version appears to be a port of the home console versions meaning that it lacks the addition of Legion mode from the PSP port and the BlayzBloo Shop (there are still unlocks from the shop available.)If you don't mind having to restart your PC to get rid of the framerate issue that appears after a while of PC uptime (fps sinks to a capped 30) every time, the PC versions of the BlazBlue games have almost instant loading times for matches (you can skip the matchup screens not long after they pop up) which make them my preferred versions, having played the latest 2 installed on the PS3.The included OST appears to be the one from the console's US Limited Edition as 320kbit mp3 files."

Now the Library rules with a tight grip, punishing anyone who defies them with death. Although it doesn't really explain it in the opening cutscene to story mode, Arc System Works made Kagutsuchi feel like an oppressed city through the backgrounds showing guards locking down certain stages, to even some of the characters who work for the NOL. Much other than that, BlazBlue focuses less on the big picture and more on the interactions between characters and their complicated relationships.BlazBlue is an absolutely gorgeous game, each hand drawn sprite looks great and is animated spectacularly. The character backgrounds also play off of the characters backstories and reflects them through the stages, like Taokaka, who comes from a poor village of cat-like people. On her stage, you can see members of her village chasing chickens around trying to eat them. All of the characters special moves, distortion drives, and astral heats are smooth and stylish.As if the story and graphics don't appease to me enough, the flashy yet simple combat system made me feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥in no time. Playing off the revolver system (attacks go from weak to strong), BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger s simple enough to pick up and start doing combos yet complex enough for seasoned vets to dish out some real damage. The crux of Calamity Trigger's play style and one best parts of the game is the ""Drive"" system. In a nutshell, no to characters play alike. Ragna the Bloodedge's drive Soul Eater steals health from the opponent and adds it to his own if he sustained damage. Jin's Frostbite freezes opponents on the spot, allowing for devastating combos. Arc also did a great job balancing out the characters. Now Tager, a beefy character with a large hitbox and no double jump or dash, can have a chance with his high damage output against Taokaka, one of the fastest characters in the game and deals a small amount of damage. The only thing I don't like, however, is when they ported Calamity Trigger to Steam, something happened and there is no online multiplayer, meaning you'll have to be sitting next to your friend to fight him.Verdict:+Beautiful graphics+addictive gameplay+Awesome Soundtrack+Balanced Roster-No Online Multiplayer9.5 OutstandingEven if Calamity Trigger isn't your favorite BlazBlue title, it is still fun plus you get the soundtrack to boot. Hopefully in the future, if it's successfull enough, Arc System Works will put Continuum Shift and Chronophantasmna on Steam as well (with online capability too). If you are a fan of Guilty Gear/P4A or just want to try a new type of fighting game, then do yourself a favor and buy BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger."

A slow movement speed and 4-button attack system make it acceptable to play this game with a standard ps3/xbox controller instead of a more specialized fight stick. Once you're into the game however, a variety of rules and systems need to be understood and learned before you can really get anywhere. I'd call blazblue a good game to cut your teeth on."

I originally bought this on PSP and played it and enjoyed the story, even though graphics obviously weren't the best but still thoroughly enjoyed it. Then, decided to import the GFWL version and totally played through every character's story branch and arcade mode. Didn't care for the netcode for online play and have always despised GFWL. I have played through Continuum Shift and still yet to play through CS Extend, but with Chrono Phantasma being out I wanted to bring myself back up to speed on the series' story and no longer have DVD drive on my laptop, so I bought the Steam version for convenience. Also, I want to show support to porting fighting games over to PC as a viable and marketable platform. How do I speak out in support of this: with my dollar. However, I will say they should have ported this over properly with online play netcode for Steam (something about GFWL online not porting over to Steam from what I've heard, but still no excuse). It may be a deal breaker for some, but not for me as I am mostly a solo player and have always played this series more for the story, which plays like a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" style visual novel.

It's also the first fighter of its format that I got any good at. The story is a gorgeous incompressible fractal, the character design is full of strong aesthetic persona that pushes all my buttons, and the mechanics are so good that lesser games such as the Street Fighter series are now unplayable to me.The way the input buffer is built allows you to jam on a button and then overwrite the input if you change your mind before the attack actually launches, provided you're fast enough. In that way it plays more like Soul Calibur and less like Mortal Kombat. That input buffer is the biggest deciding factor in whether I buy a fighting game now. The quick-sticking system is also a godsend to new players: push the analog stick in one of the up or right to do a character-specific special move, left to do a super move, and down to do a finisher after you unlock them. This is a system that should be in all fighting games.Also a part of the Brawl Minus school of gameplay balance: when every character is OP, no one is. Each character breaks the rules of the game in their own unique way from Tao's directional air dashes to Hakumen's counter button and autocharging specials to Nu 13's intangible-dash cancels and ability to attack anywhere on the screen if you're precise enough.Pro tip tho: don't rely on integrated graphics to play it. My laptop chugs a bit, and as a very technical player this can throw me off considerably in more intense matches. That or I've gotten so fast that I need a new controller, because I'm inputting moves faster than the analog stick's sample rate.The franchise is part of my Platinum Collection. On PS3/360 I've put over 2k hours combined into this series, and now I get to buy them all over again on Steam.Hurry up and release Chrono Phantasma: Extend on Steam so I can buy that too."

The visuals are spectaclarly detailed. The voice acting is, overall, wonderful, with only a couple of flat performances. The narritive is rich, detailed, and shrouded in so much mystery, you won't be able to put it down until you know everything there is to know about BB:CT. And most importantly, the gameplay is fantastic; surprisingly smooth and even, and set at just the right pace.There isn't much wrong in this game, other than a few nit-picky things that are purely my opinion, but I'm pretty sure that someone out there agrees with me. Firstly, the voice acting can get a little flat. I mean, it isn't something that's going to distract you too much, as the characters with the flat acting only appear once or twice in the story mode, and there are far from important to the plot (they aren't even named so I have no clue why I'm complaining - _ -'), but it's just a little thing I noticed. Another thing is how many cliff-hangers there are in the story. I know, I know, that's like saying that I don't want a sequel, and that I don't like the mystery, which I do; but still, they could at least wrap up a few things. I won't give any spoilers, in case someone reading this hasn't played the game, but it left me hungry for more, and if the sequels follow this example, leaving me in the dark until either the next installment is ported to Steam or newly released to the masses (which, from the looks of it, could take a while), then I'll go insane trying to formulate theories for what happens.Despite my nit-picks, BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is one awesome game. Take it from a new fan who's downloading the sequel as he types; if you haven't played this game, you really should."

As of this review date, Chrono Phantasma is the third and latest release but is not yet on Steam, and Central Fiction will be the fourth entry to the series.Onto the review of this game, the most important thing to note is that there is no online multiplayer, which means no possibility to play online with friends or against random people. That means the only reason to buy this game is the story mode and as a cheap (while on sale) way to get into the franchise and be acquainted to the Blazblue universe and its characters.The story mode is pretty typical visual novel-esque type of gameplay. The voice options are English and Japanese with tons of voiced dialogue. Text options include: English, Chinese, Korean, French, Italian, German, Spanish and Japanese.There is no tutorial of any kind, but if you're only going to play for story mode it won't matter too much as it's fairly easy to get through it regardless of your skill.The roster size is 12.The music is exceptional."

Likeable characters each with their own unique fighting style, very interesting story, memorable OST's, i could go on but we would be here forever.  One thing to keep in mind is this is a PC port of the original console version. It is mainly for single player with the standard fighting genre modes (including versus and score attack), there is no online mode so a bit outdated in that regard.  Aside from that difference, it is still an awesome game that started off such an amazing series.  If you really enjoy playing this game I highly recommend considering playing the sequels Continuum Shift Extend and Chronophantasma (last in the series story wise), as both have added content and new playable characters alongside the original cast."

Created by the same guys who make the Guilty Gear Series, and the Persona Arena series, both good ones, this is a game that really serves well its purposes.The commands can be a bit clunky and hard to use at first, for those that are new to the game. This is one of those games that requires a bit of you to get into it. But the idea here is to use well your 'X'(PS)/'A'(Xbox) button, since it helps to make the combos and also make the special moves. This is a game where you have to understand your character, and it is hard to pick any fighter and have some fun (you can still button smash though, that helps a lot)The problem of this game itself is the lack of any online multiplayer mode. It is understandable, since this game is really old and there is a newer game of the series here in the Steam (go look for it, Continuum Shift). But, the thing is that the story and arcade mode is good and can get yourself into the game somewhat easy, so, I only recommend it if you want to play it for the story mode. Also, if you buy it, it is nice for you to understand the mechanics of the series, or even if you play a lot with any local friend.This game gets a nice discount in sales, so I recommend that you don't buy it full price. And if you like it, go look for the Continuum Shift. It is really better."

There is English voice acting, which is a plus in my book, and the story mode is actually good for a fighting game.

This possess a few problems, as first, steam doesn't actually have any achievements, instead, the game goes after the xbox/ps3 achievements, making it a bit hard to know what to do, second, some of the achievements are fairly hard, so casual players are locked out from that part of the gallery, and third, the game does not support online play, and since some of the achievements are tied to online play, it means it is actually impossible to complete the gallery.

The problem is that the game is really fun but its also extremely iritating with its strange save systems and the fact you can't get 100% for characters if you don't lose at least once and getting 100% is really annoying. I almost gave up the game when I started but I perservered through it. The story is good but its fractured. You never get the full picture and nothing ever makes real sense. You can put some pieces together but in the end you are always left with more questions then answers. It's hard to invest yourself when you have no clue whats going on and there are no rules to speak of. I am glad that you can play this game on keyboard and a controller isn't required.
