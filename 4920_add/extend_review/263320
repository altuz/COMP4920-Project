Those were the good old days- when CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX all had Saturday Morning blocks of cartoons.You get to play as Marty, a guy who watches too many of these old cartoons.  His goal is to stop the forces of evil from taking over the world- and to stop them by using as many 80s pop-culture references as he can cram in his Trapper Keeper.  You can attach scratch-and-sniff stickers to your binder to give you special powers and increased stats when you scratch them, but let's face it- Marty's no Lion-O when it comes to battle.  Relying on physical attacks just won't get you anywhere- instead, you can rely on those same pop-culture shoutouts, like giant plastic playsets (like G.I. Joe's old giant carriers) and rainbow-striped zebras, and obvious knockoffs of Care Bears to do damage.If you remember the late 80s, you'll love all the shoutouts to cartoons that anyone born after the early 90s will never get the references to- if you were born later, you'll love the game for its playstyle- it's easy to pick up, fun to play, and it won't run you that much.  There are four episodes currently- if you count the overly short and played-up-for-cheesiness Christmas Special, and I'd like to see a fifth, if they ever decide to make one- or a sequel."

It is actually fun to play with many weapons types and subtle tactics to use to win fights. Please bear in mind that this was a phone app originally and came to Steam via Greenlight so it is not a state of the art game.

,Recommended,263320,8908416,"Posted: 30 January, 2014",all,Cheshire Buddha,"Saturday Morning RPG is a love letter to 80s nostalgia while at the same time playing homage to the timed-hits style battle system that has shown up before in RPGs. While I wasn't an 80s kid so I was never the biggest G.I. Joe or Transformer fan, I do know a lot about the pop culture of the time and I'm a huge fan of films from the decade.The real draw here was the game's battle system to me. I'm a huge Super Mario RPG fan, and this game draws inspiration from the series that follow it up: Paper Mario. It's also been used in Costume Quest (which the game is more similar to in design), and will even be in the upcoming South Park: The Stick of Truth. So as a fan of the genre, I felt it was nesscary to toss down the cash on it.And I enjoyed it. The game isn't the best RPG I've ever played (of all time...ever), but it's the writing, humor, and references that made me want to keep playing. Now, I've heard people saying this is a short game. Well, not really. You aren't going to beat this game quickly unless you skip all the side-quests and head straight from point A to point B. I don't suggest this. You'll miss out on a lot of a fun events, like when you find a Mogwai-esque creature and have the choice to feed it and get it wet before giving it back to Phoebe Cates herself. There IS a point around the third episode where the battles started to feel repetitive, but that soon went away as I found myself smashing Transformers with a freakin' axe. Not everyone is going to like it, but there are enough options in battle to keep situations fresh if need be. Better healing options (I didn't find a single GREAT healing item in my run) and more PCs (or a Paper Mario-esque helper) would have spiced up the battles, but if you're a fan of this type of battle system then you'll enjoy it.You'll spend almost 5 hours with the first four episodes of Saturday Morning RPG. Another five more if you go back for achievements or try a hand at the other game modes. And for $7, it's in a good price range where a blind buy isn't risky if you're a fan of the genre and have just a little knowledge of the 80s. It's not the best RPG of all time, but it's a great indie effort and I'm always happy to see more of these.(7/10)Recommended If You Like:Paper MarioCostume Quest80s movies, cartoon, and general pop culture"

I can't say I'm overwhelmed with the much vaunted ""humour"" (and I AM a child of the 80's having been birthed in the 70's). The gameplay is nothing special either but it's good enough to be more than worth the pitiful ammount this game sells for. You could do a lot worse for a lot more cash. Pick it up, use it as filler, and you will have a little fun."
,Not Recommended,263320,31851646,Posted: 19 May,all,Veil_Lord,"I hate to give it a bad review, but the combat system is just awful.  So far there are like 4 attacks done over and over and over and over and over again.  The nostalga factor is great.  The animation is a beautfil mix of regular and pixel and the controls handle well.However, the programmers were SO SLOPPY that they use the keyboard control icons even if you use a controler so you can't figure out what button corresponds to what effectively removing one of the attack options.  The rest is wiggle the mouse, time the button tap, repeat until you just with it was over.  Don't worry though, the episodes are so short it will be soon.  For dirt cheap it's OK, but there's a decent chance you'll just give up regardless."

The first two episodes are the best part of the work, with some clever design and interesting ideas.Sadly, the remainder of the game starts falling flat and doesn't really recover. The fifth episode is unfortunately both obtuse in the puzzles presented and pretty short, and the story they laid out just kind of takes a sharp left turn into ""wut"" territory.The nostalgia factor is pretty strong, but the humor is a bit overly pun-dependent for my tastes. I picked it up on Steam sale, and I'd recommend giving it a shot in a sale if you have nostalgia for 80's pop culture, but other than that I can't really recommend this one.A final note: if you have motor disabilities, steer clear of the game completely. A lot of the combat is based around either timed presses or button mashing/control stick shaking, and if you have trouble with fine motor movements, you will likely have a much harder time with this game. I did not see an accessibility option for getting around that requirement."
,Recommended,263320,13455233,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,Solocitizen,"This game relies more on its charm and its disctinct tone and aesthetic than its game play. The game play is quite a lot like paper mario's only less well thought out. That said, it does provide some unique and interesting ways of mixing things up a bit and keeping them fresh, like the scratch and sniff mechanic and the little mini-games you have to perform before executing most of your attacks. After a while, though, it all starts to get pretty repetative.As I said though, if you play this game, don't play it for the game play: play it for the humor. Play it because you'd like to take a trip to a place where '80s pop-culture has run rampent and you must stop Lord Hood (basically the Cobra Commander) because the Share Bears and the Go-Bots are depending on you.If you didn't understand anything I said in the last sentence or see anything close to humor in it, don't bother picking up this game.

76561198009316076,Recommended,263320,19667148,"Posted: 12 December, 2015",all,The Matlock,"I find it a shame and astonishing that a game as good as Saturday Morning RPG has not done better commercially. The game has some crazy achievements, such as fighitng 1,000 and even up to 5,000 battles, based on an initial idea of 20 episodes. Since it didn't do well, they had to limit their ambitions to six episodes, hopefully with a fine tuning of the achievements in the future.But why is all this necessary? The game has everyone a gamer would be looking for. A series of episodes with a simple story, with tons of nostalgic references for one thing. I mean the main character is a guy named Marty, who rides a hoverboard, and gets his powers from a mysterious man known as The Wizard. The retro graphics are a joy to behold, the music is killer, and the gameplay is a very solid Paper Mario/Super Mario RPG type of thing, with button presses for better defense and better attacks.Not to mention your magic spells use everyday objects, from cookies and paper airplanes, to swords and baseball bats, up to toy aircraft carriers and transformer-like figurines. Hell even your notebook plays a part in the game as depending on the cover and the stickers you can enact various bonuses before each battle.As it stands at this time there are four episodes, with total time of about 10 hours to get through all of them. There is an arena mode against two semi-tough bosses, and endless battle challenges based around each chapter. You can get the grindy achievements I mentioned earlier legitimately, but my first run through the game got me less then even 100 battles, not counting everything else. Still if you want to, the game is a pleasure to play, and with the huge episode 5 coming early next year, there's no time like the present to get in and get ready for it.Super totally awesomely retro-nostalgia recommendation."

Unlike Shovel Knight and Freedom Planet, this represents the bad kind of nostalgia, the kind that just says ""Power Glove"" and ""Skeletor"" and ""Captain N"" until it gets old.  The game's initial presentation is nice, but its not any different mechanically from any other Paper Mario esque rpg.  And it lacks the charming scenarios and characters and presentation that you could get from similar cartoony RPG's with active battle systems.  It's initially charming and stupid in a good way, but the lack of story and fun mechanics didn't really do it for me.  Pass on this one."

It's a tribute to GI Joe, Transformers, every John Waters movie, Back to the Future, and of course the bygone Saturday morning cartoon lineups.  Pretty much every other pixel-graphics game out there uses them not for nostalgia, but because they're cheap and easy.  At least in this game the graphics actually complement the theme.  The badge system and equipment scheme familiar to many RPGs is cleverly turned into ""stickers,"" and items stashed into a magical Trapper Keeper-style notebook.  Righteous.  There are a good bit of side quests to explore.  Some of the weapon animations are absurdly funny, and you earn steam achievements for trying out different things during combat.  Which, by the way, is a well designed mix of strategy and button mashing.  The four main story quests are on the easy side, but the arena and endless-wave battle modes are challenging.  Completionists will likely want to replay all the levels to get everything.  I'm looking forward to episode 5.  Recommended for turn-based RPG fans of any age and, definitely for every 80s kid."

It touts the throwback to the 80's pretty heavily and it delivers without being just one name drop after another.  The combat system seems balanced but will definately get repetative, and you may find yourself choosing skills not based on what they do but based on the minigame (which tend the be pretty uninspired) or lack thereof.  Episodic game play is an interesting choice though I'm really not sure how much replayability this game will give you would be grinding or achievement hunting.Overall it won't blow your mind but then again not many things in the $5 range will."

The battles are tedious affairs, with every enemy getting two attacks to my one, it's a matter of sitting around waiting for my turn, especially when faced with three opponents.  The rest of the game is mostly walking around repetitive caves/hallways, moving from battle to battle.Low budget, low-res games can be every bit as entertaining as AAA titles, and I have enjoyed many hours with them.

I delayed buying it because I was afraid it would botch the mid-80s setting or turn out to be an unimaginative parody. That was a mistake. This game is a genuinely creative love-song to the era. The NPC's have personalities, the setting and art is delightful, and the music is perfect. One quibble is that the soundtrack could have been longer. The combat system could be deeper, but it's adequate to make the battles exciting and often challenging.I was particularly impressed with the writing. The authors managed to combine some of the best storytelling elements of early RPG's with mid-1980s' cartoon serials. Like it's inspirations, the game's stories are funny yet also morally sincere. The snarky irony of 1990-current storytelling is conspicuous by its absence.Highly recommended. It's not necessary at all to have lived through the mid-1980s to enjoy this game. I hope to see more from this game's developers."

So, obvious bias aside, I will try to review this the same way that I review other games: by aesthetic appeal.The main aesthetics this appeals to are Sensory, Fantasy, Narrative and Discovery. Challenge is also there depending on how you set the difficulty in game and how much you are concerned with acheivements. There's also a huge nostalgia factor for anyone that grew up in the 80's or 90's.For those who like 80's music (pop/rock and video game/cartoon soundtracks) you will really enjoy the soundtrack that Vince DiCola and Kenny Meriedeth have composed.If you enjoyed games like Super Mario RPG(and Paper Mario Series), Earthbound(Mother Series), Pokemon, Final Fantasy (Particularly 1-9), Costume Quest, or other JRPGs you should give Saturday Morning RPG a try. Also I suggest it to fans of 80's and 90's music and pop culture. If you enjoy humorous games (like Double Fine games) this is worth checking out. If you are on the fence and can't decide if you would like it you can try the full first episode for free if you have a tablet."

It triggers a lot of nostalgia, and I am really enjoying it. It doesn't just throw things at you from the 1980s, the entire writing style is done like cartoons were done back then. The first episode actually has your girlfriend captured by the villian so he can force her to marry him. It's goofy and absurd with little bits of gameplay thrown in.That said, if you take all of that away... This is not a great game. The controls are really not well explained and you have to figure out how to use each new attack all on your own through trial and error. The menu system is not very well designed, and before you can even adjust your graphics settings you have to start a new game. Maybe this is intentional, since most games you played back then required you read everything from the instruction book. Or if you rented the game and it didn't have one, you'd have to figure it all out yourself.I still recommend this game because in spite of the gameplay issues, I'm enjoying it.

The game takes place in a boys dream where he explores the world on his skate board and fights off enemies to save the girl.  The script is deliberately cliche and has lots of vague references from the era.  For me the big let down was the combat, it just wasn't fun.  The attacks consist of either quicktime events with on screen button prompts or timing a button press with a cursor moving along a meter.  The player can also charge up for bigger attacks but this mechanic is another event requiring a button press timed against a meter.  With the style of combat, despite 5+ hours of gameplay, I can't recommend Saturday Morning RPG.EDIT (2/4/14): Updated the gameplay time to 5+ hours."

However, even if you did not grow up in the 80's I think you will enjoy this game as long as you like a good old school RPGs.Pros:- great dialogue that will make you chuckle, even if you don't get all the references it is relatable enough for anyone to get a laugh out of the characters in this game.-fun turn based combat- think super mario RPG, if you never played that shame on you, you really should, but basically it is turn based but with timed button presses.  Different moves you do bring up different mini games that require timing to inflict max damage.  Also when enemies attack you, timed button presses reduce the damage dealt, the better your timing the less damage they inflict.- lots of cool items to collect, the weapons in this game are varied and funny and range from ordinary stuff like baseball bats to some bizzare things like simon says and fruit stripes gum.-free DLC coming in the future, 4 episodes right now and the game will probably take you roughly 4-5 hours to finish if you do most of the side quests (you will want to, as they are generally worth a chuckle), the developer has confirmed episode 5 is coming soon which will be free, any future episodes will also be free.-epsiodic layout gives the game a nice feel, each level is large enough on its own and riddled with secrets and side quests and the episodic nature of the game means you don't have to worry about doing any boring backtracking which is all too common in RPG'scons-linear character development, not a huge con but if your into branching paths and stuff like that you won't get it here, you quickly learn that magic is the best, you will pour your stats into that and wreak havoc with your flying laser discs and karate kid headbands.Overall if you are into turn based rpg's with fun combat system and a funny story you will like this.  It is not an epic game, and it does not take itself seriously, but it is fun and you will laugh while you play it, and IMO that is what video games are all about."

I was drawn into a fight very frequently and could barely navigate my way around with so many enemies. It is a great way to grind for XP, if you're wanting that kind of action. Although I didn't happen to be in existence during the 80's, I did understand most of the references made throughout my experience in Saturday Morning RPG. If you frequent the Internet and know just a little bit about pop culture, you should be fine.The references, packaged with the game's humor and absurd writing, is where Saturday Morning RPG really shines. I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect the game and that alone could serve as the basis for my recommendation of the game. The game's combat does get repetitive, very quickly in my case, but I still managed to enjoy myself despite this. There are plenty of side quests available, adding a great deal of content to the game. The game wouldn't take that long to beat by itself, so the side quests really add value to the game as a whole.The game's graphics were nothing too fantastic. In fact, it looks like the graphics originated from a mobile game. Most of the graphics are sprite-based, so can't really complain there. The graphics blended both 2D and 3D objects into one, large 3D environment. It took a little getting used to, haven't played a game with this style in a while, but it wasn't anything to complain about.Saturday Morning RPG is a great effort, I really enjoyed my time with it and look forward to completing it in the near future.

The game gave me a lot of nostalgia and I personally found it hilarious.  I think that the comedy might fall flat on some of the game's references though for people not familiar with the 80's - 90's.The game is pretty easy to pick up and get into as it plays like an older RPG of the NES/SNES days.  With that said do not expect any crazy mechanical game play.  I think the most mechanical thing I had to do was try to hit a ball a la old video game pong style.  The fighting was interactive though, with rapid button presses to charge attacks and meter based attacks.I definitely recommend this game to anyone familiar with the 80's and 90's and that are looking for a fun and funny RPG."

Some of the things that come to mind are:I was alive for the 80s.The combat seems really simplistic at first, being turn-based with occasional minigames.  But it gets more interesting as you get more and varied items and try to figure out what they do, eventually developing a sort of fighting style around favored items.  It was a little easy sometimes, but by no means mindless.  Though I had a bit of an advantage--using a keyboard makes the button-mashing bits a lot easier.At the end of a chapter it tells you whether you missed anything  (exploration, fights, items, &c) so you actually have a goal in going back to replay things other than ""more XP"".  Opt-out-able level-scaling means that it's not easy unless you want it to be.There were a couple puzzle elements but they're more of a short break than a main component.The script is humorous and slightly cheesy.  But so were 80s cartoons.I had a cannot-play-the-game-at-all level bug.  The devs fixed it within days.The game has four episodes now--apparently they're planning a fifth and sixth for free.One thing I really wish they had was a better explanation of the stat system.  Or really any explanation at all.  I've mostly gotten through by just guessing at what the numbers affect.There's an arena mode and an endless mode, but I haven't played much of either yet."

The best feature of this game in my opinion is that it is divided into episodes. Each episode has a self-contained story arc, and allows you to replay sections of the game you enjoy, whiel ignoring ones you don't. I would like to see a similar mechanic in more mainstream games.The gameplay itself is very simple, and involves powering up, and mashing buttons. However, some attacks have amusing animations, such as the BB gun(you'll shoot your eye out, lol). Also, there is only one playable character, Marty.All in all, This game is worth the six bucks just for the humor. For those looking for a hard-core rpg, probably not."

Looking at the forums, it seems other people have been having this problem and have been asking for a fix since the game launched, over 2 years ago.

The UI is really frustrating, especially if you're playing on pad because I kept trying to change the button style layout and it keeps defaulting to the keyboard style layout. And as a personal opinion, I'm not too fond of the visuals, there's more 3D elements than 2D elements and it's a bit of a mess. Honestly, if you want a game that's very 1980s esque but filled with easter eggs, go play Retro City Rampage instead."

I was somewhat disappointed.  The 80's references are jumbled and make no sense (why would the Cobra analog exist in a He-Man inspired locale?)  Many of the weapons are just plain useless and you basically have to ""power up"" all the time to be effective in overly simplistic combat.  The game world itself is overly simplistic and basically just involves wandering around from fight to fight until a boss battle.  ...And the soundtrack isn't very good and only vaguely reminiscent of Vince DiCola's other work.  Did I mention that the transforming sound effect from Transformers is literally somebody making ""whoosh whoosh whoosh"" sounds with their mouth into a microphone?  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the quality of other indie games I've played, but this one doesn't live up to the hype."

On that note, if you get a moderate to severe debuff to your accuracy, you may as well restart the battle since you are pretty much next to guaranteed to not hit .Good:Quests were intuitive with their direction and were easy to understand and undertake as a result.Lots of different items and builds to experiment, with some degree of flexibility with changing builds via stickers.Being able to repeat episodes allow you to make different choices and do quests/obtain items one may have missed.Overall: 6.5/10Points deducted mainly for game balance and minor UI issues.For such a cheap price, do buy it for an enjoyable game with some quirks."

It is a love-letter to the pop-culture of the 1980s and has no apologies to offer for that. As an RPG game, it both is amazing and disappointing at the same time. The gameplay itself is surprisingly deep and something I can not recommend enough, but at the time, it is very short for RPGs (I finished it in about 8 hours) and the overall story falls very flat.If you look back fondly on an 80s childhood, this is probably a game you should get your hands on, as you will enjoy it. If not, the strengths and weakness of this RPG kinda makes it a toss-up.

The graphics work well for the type of game that it is - a homage to the 1980's and early 90's culture. I bought this game and didn't know what to expect. What I found was a well-made, thoughtful but fun and light game that may become my game of the year. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone. It was very rewarding to play this game - it was FUN. It was a feel-good experience and I just hope there is more of this game. DLC? Count me in DAY ONE!EDIT: UPDATE - August 23, 2015 - I've started playing the game again to get achievements and complete levels. Doing that really takes the gameplay to a new level and increases the challenge. Playing the game fully takes a game that was a ""quick playthrough"" and turns it into a full gaming experience.Returning to the game after playing it once gives new perspective. The game is STILL fun, enjoyable and well made. I would still highly recommend it to others.EDIT: UPDATE - August 25, 2015 - This game has been due for an update for the past two years. EPISODE 5 was due two years ago, but has been pushed to ""summer 2015"" as per the games Steam page selling the games soundtrack. It's 2015 and there is no update yet. This is important because this game has achievements and one of them is ""complete 5 episodes"" - and you can't do this with the current 4 episodes that are released.As much as I love this game, other players need to know that there is an UPDATE DELAY that impacts the ability to play the game and makes 100% completion impossible.  I have posted twice on the facebook group of Saturday Morning RPG but there is no word from the developer. I will update this as needes."

,Recommended,263320,11489682,"Posted: 31 July, 2014",all,Epidra,"Saturday Morning RPG is your classical turn based Role Playing Game with the feeling of the old 80s cartoons. The main character Marty has a vivid dream about the super villain Hood as he kidnaps the hero's love interest. Equipped with a magical notebook, he gets from a spontaneously appearing wizard, Marty makes his way into the enemy main base. And so begins the first episode of SMRPG.GameplaySMRPG features the very classical RPG Systems. Top down view while travelling through the overworld, doing some quest and turn based battles when engaging an enemy in the overworld. If you don't know what a RPG is, well, you missed quite a lot of video game culture. If a battle get started you switchSaturday Morning RPG 01 to a battle screen. During the course of the game you only have Marty as playable character, so goodbye party formations. The enemy side can consist of up to three opponents with varying color scheme. Luckily the devs got every scheme unique looks and features. Your different actions in the battle consists of a normal punch, a power up move and the various tools and toys you collect in your adventure. You get stuff like a floppy disk, a transformer, or even the power of a share bear. All with varying stats and effects. For some of them you need to beat a little mini game to unlock ist full power, but nothing really difficult. The power up action is a neat little feature. You have a damage multiplier in the lower left corner, that you can increase with every action. You have three possible options for that, two of them are mini games where you either need to press the button multiple times, or in the right moment, and an option where it happens automatically. You lose a round by doing that, but you get a multiplier increase of three or four points each time, so the pay of is quite nice.Story (Spoiler Warning)This game is a living 80s reference. The main character Marty travels ona hoverboard (Who can guess his last name?), transformers, Share Bears, and a villain who comes back every week with a new idea to take over the world. The game currently consists of four episodes. The first is a dream episode, Saturday Morning RPG 02where Marty gets ist power and rescues the girl of his dreams. Sadly it's only a dream and this girl is still together with the greatest jerk in school, bet, hey, at least he can keep his new powers and in the next episode he can use them against this giant death laser his arch-villain commander hood has hidden under his school and ruins the bake sale with it. With the third episode you see a little change in style, because this time you have nothing better to do than fighting giant evil transformers. And saving the city dam on that way. In episode four the devs proudly presents you the christmas special episode, where you need to save christmas and bring back all the stolen presents. (guess who did that) In the end of the episode you even see a nice surprise.FutureCurrently only four of once 20 planned episodes are in the game. The problem was that this game was first made for iOS and didn't really well there. But since it's on steam now the sales are much better and the good guy devs promised to bring out new episodes FOR FREE. Episode 5 and 6 are even in production right now. And that'S good, because there are some loose ends from a few side quests i really want to know how that's going to end.ConclusionPro:- Classical old school RPG- many 80s references- Entertaining storyCon:- low content at the momentYou have a nice looking game on your hand here. If you take your time to do all side quest you can get around 5 to 10 hours of fun out of it, depending if replaying some episodes, which some side quests and the achievements encourage. The battle system works flawlessly, the story is good and there a lot stuff to collect to keep you occupied. But see for yourself, theres nothing that can go wrong with it. And if still have concerns wait for a steam sale. A 75% Off will definitely convince you to buy it.For more Reviews visit my Blog at:http://achievementunlockblog.wordpress.com/home/"

This is THE BEST RPG I've played just behind the Mass Effect Trilogy, and Oblivion, which are my number 1 & 2 favorites respectively!  That's saying quite a bit since I play a lot of RPG's.  I'd have to say this is even better than Might and Magic III, Skyrim, Baldur's Gate, Final Fantasy 7&10, Super Mario RPG, and Costume Quest!I have to say, this game is completely worth it at full price!  Don't wait for a sale!  GO BUY THIS NOW!!!"
,Recommended,263320,11098169,"Posted: 6 July, 2014",all,Matt,"Short review: Buy this game.Longer review: Buy this game, because it has a lot of elements coming together in the right ways. The gameplay has a classic JRPG feel, but still does its own thing. It's turn based, with timed attacks (and defenses). There's enough complexity to make strategy more than just selecting the same attack every time. You can select several stickers, that give combat buffs (or to your enemies, debuffs), as well as your special attacks in the form of items. These are balanced in terms of speed, power, accuracy, as well as price. One item might do massive damage, but be costly, or take a long time to be used once selected, or maybe not always hit. A big part of the strategy is selecting the best prefight equipment.The episodes are decent length, about an hour or so, depending on how much you like to explore and do side quests. What I really appreciated was the lack of artificial extension. The game doesn't have you backtrack, or wander around to find where you need to go. Objectives are clear, and you can always tell where you need to go by arrows on screen. It keeps the game moving quickly if you want to rush, but you're also free to explore, talk to characters, and just enjoy the environments.While it's fun enough as an RPG, the overall atmosphere is the main draw. It lives and breathes nostalgia for the 80s (and early 90s), and anyone who spent their childhood watching Transformers, or playing with GIJoe will have an extra appreciation for it. Though, even if you weren't a kid in the US during the 80s/early 90s, you can still appreciate it.The nostalgia isn't forced, or bled dry. It's just there, so the game feels like it's of the era, rather than just looking back at it. It's challenging, but not frustrating, and the humor is subtle. In short, the game has charm.My only complaint would be the lack of length. It doesn't have 100+ hours of gameplay... probably more like 10-20 until you get bored (I clocked in about 16 hours, when counting replaying the episodes, and trying out the arenas). Still, those will be pretty fun 10-20 hours."

If you already know this kind of game is your thing, get it. It takes the funnest element from, Super Mario RPG, and flies it around like you wouldn't believe. The turn-based combat system allows for adding extra punch to your attack, and extra toughness to your defense by using anything from a simple push of the button at the right moment, to playing Pong from Atari to bounce a ball at opponents for a few hits. They really went crazy with it. I like an RPG that can force me into a bit of cardio for that bit of extra power. The story is simple, and still entertaining. I like all of the, 'I see what you did there,' moments as well. Anyway, the bottom line is t hat this game is a refreshing satire on all of the 80's era cartoons and games, with a little bit of 90's thrown in to boot, and it's well done. The graphics of course aren't anything special, but quite frankly my dears, I don't give a damn. It all just fits together well."

This game makes references to 80s popculture like transformers, g.i joe, carebares, he-man, nintendo, etc. the perfect nostalgia buzz. But as a game its quite good. The story is basicly captin N, but with tv shows, but still enjoyable. Its a pokemon style game. Explore the world, and go into a turn base battles. I recommand the game for people who are aware of 80s popculture, and if youree one of those people and love RPGs, this is the game youve dreamed of. But be warned of tought boss battles. 8/10."

While loaded with ""retro"" humour and pop-cultural references, the game also manages to keep a more or less coherent plot to it. The turn-based combat harkens back to Super Mario RPG on the SNES.Anyway, I'd say that overall if you are a fan of 1980's and early 1990's cartoons, video games and movies, you'd probably get a kick out of this game. I certainly am."

On top of fun characters and story the game play is pretty tight and the combat system throws enough in to keep things from getting stail. My only gripe is that you pretty much play through it alone, you don't get any back up and you fight the hordes of bad guys by yourself. Other than that it's a great game and I highly recomend it."

Admittedly I am the exact target audience for this game - I grew up in the 80s and still remember sneaking downstairs waaaaaayyyy too early on Saturday mornings to watch Voltron, Dungeons & Dragons, Josie & the ♥♥♥♥♥cats, etc. and nearly dying of  excitement the year we finally got an original Nintendo. Everything from the music, to the quests, to the NPC dialog perfectly captures both my real and imaginary life from that time period - I love it.Speaking somewhat less subjectively. The episodes are short - for me that's a bonus. Each one took me 45-80 minutes for the first run through, and that was fully exploring. But that is perfect if you don't have a lot of time and want to feel like you're accomplishing something in a gaming session. Also, there is some replay value, as you get to keep all your new shinies when you replay a level, so you can experience the satisfaction of instantly obliterating a baddie that gave you trouble the first time around. But I can see how a short game would be unsatisfying to some players. But don't say it's not worth the $$. It's like, $1.50 now, and even if you pay the full $6.99 that is around $1 per hour of fun at most. If you're willing to pay even $5 for a matinee movie, you can't complain this game isn't worth it.Also the battles, turn based, can be a little repetative - especially in the beginning. But once I had a few more weapons/defensive options/buffs I had a lot of fun playing around with various combinations.No the graphics aren't up to Witcher 3 standard. Or 2. or 1.  Or...   80s remember?That said, if you've ever seen the Transformers cartoons and thought only ""Ugg, this is unbearable"" or can't stand music from before 1998 then maybe this game isn't for you. But anyone who had to sit through a D.A.R.E program, or rushed home aftrer school, hoping not to miss the Transformers OP please, please ""risk"" $1.50 (or whatever!) on this game. The psychological benefits of just the first 15 minutes alone are probably greater than your last 5 therapy session.**I'm not mocking therapy or people who need it! I'm in therapy! I'm just saying laughing and feeling good is good,"

That makes it incredibly entertaining, and I want more episodes just to see what other things show up. It's a non-stop run of references, like if I Love the 80s was a video game.I like the style of the art as well, although the biggest issue is that the fighting gets a bit repetitive, and the grades for it feel a bit arbitrary. For what the rest of it has, though, I can more than forgive it that, though I feel like if I could more easily test out different weapons I'd not be as bored, but with only 5 slots, it's tough to take leaps to try other weapons."

Having to scratch off stickers for every fight brings back awful memories of the first Mario Party. Other than that one gripe, I have nothing but good things to say. A Paper Mario style twitch reaction RPG combat system that gives you the option to charge any attack makes battles engaging more than just selecting attack over and over. Numerous ""spells"" to equip give you the chance to experiment and find what you like. Loads of 80's pop culture references are supported by catchy synth music and great pixel animation. Only 5 chapters is a bit of a bummer and the game may be slightly overpriced for its' length but arena mode, endless mode, and that tantalizing %100 completion give you a decent bang for your buck. I hope to see a sequel. A sequel with no stickers."
