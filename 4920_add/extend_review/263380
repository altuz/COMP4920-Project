It has good charcterisation and quests, seems family friendly from what I have played.I give a quick overview of the game/ review here if you are intrested:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PajaF50hCng"
76561198001362759,Not Recommended,263380,13689035,"Posted: 29 December, 2014",all,Gana,"The game is quite nice to look at and is fairly fun to play as a rather short and very casual game.  It's definitely geared toward kids and if there were no combat it would be perfect for extremely sheltered young'uns -- though maddeningly twee and boring for adults. Without combat it would be mind-numbingly dull.Combat is very simple, you choose your weapon and click on the enemy and it auto-fights for you. It has a very basic skill tree where you are able to choose if you want to put xp points into weapons, or into passive skills or into other benefits.There is no voice acting, but there's reams of reading between conversations you have with other characters and in books you find.  If there had been voice acting I would either have been telling the screen to shut-up or skipped all dialogue options about half way through, so no voice is a positive rather than a complaint.There are a number of different puzzles you have to solve to advance, and if you play a lot of puzzle games you would probably find them easy.  If you don't, then a couple of them will be frustratingly difficult.  Kids will probably need help with several of them.Most of your time in the game is spent looking for plants to pick and objects to pick up, many of the latter are hidden under or behind furniture which you are able to drag out of the way.  You can craft simple potions and a few weapons once you find or buy 'blueprints', as well as being able to buy what you need from several vendors.  Overall, the game is a really good training RPG.I have one big complaint about the game though, enough of one that I can't recommend it.  The game makers want to share their love of God with you.  One of the hidden books you find in the middle of the game, if you are a diligent searcher, has the entire Old Testament in it with the disclaimer that you aren't expected to read it if you don't want to but the Devs need to share their belief.  After that, the amount of times your character is told to pray because of danger is infuriating.  When I buy a game, especially a fantasy game, I am not paying for the Devs to evangelize at me."

There are only a couple dozen different loot items, a bare handful of potions you can create, you can only play as a male character, and the religious undertones get more and more annoying - it starts off as a couple of monks and quotes (mostly harmless, but then there are a few about intellect being bad and faith being good). And then you find a copy of the entire new testament of the bible under a bookshelf. Games really shouldn't be a showcase for the developers' religious inclinations. Bad move.Additionally, there are many plagiarised quotes where the author has not been noted, as well as the entire Black Knight sketch from Monty Python, again, with no credit.I'm glad I only paid $2.50 for it. But honestly, save yourself $2.50."

There were low-fi graphics, point-and-click pickups, skill trees that were obviously more useful than others, and tutorials of questionable utility. In many ways, Driftmoon reminds me of Runescape. The graphics are a bit better, the game tries along the way to sortof let you know how to play but not really, and some of the skills are clearly better than others. They are similar enough that I almost missed the mining bots taking up all the resources and the griefers trying to kill me every 30 seconds. Almost.This game had a small production crew, and it shows. Having said that, this game is also gotod for what it is. The story is decent, albeit predictable. The music becomes part of the background, and while it isn't remarkable per se it at least does you the favour of not breaking your immersion. Quests are well-defined and none of them seemed to be broken. I had a couple problems with items disappearing from my inventory if I tried to move them to my hotbar, but hey.Buy if you want to cruise through a short RPG story in a few hours. Don't buy if you're looking for a Dragon Age style hack n slash 70 hour marathon."

While the storyline is  linear and it's always obvious where your next checkpoint is, you still have decent freedom to explore a large and detailed map to discover sidequests.Pros:- You can equip your companions with your own equipment.- When your companions follow you around the map, they will automatically comment on things that are interesting to them, e.g.Word's comment when he passed by a petrified statue of his father in the final dungeon- Instant teleportation to different points on the map- Lots of craftable items to collect as you walk around- Inventory that allows you to hold most of the items you pick up during the game- Auto-regeneration of health using the food system (food is plentiful throughout the game)- Varied enemies- Plenty of side quests- Secret areas- Most small items can be dragged around to possibly reveal hidden treasures- Fluid controls-All the characters you've built a rapport with come to support you in the final dungeon.  I really liked how it's a reminder of the friends you've made in the game.- Interesting NPCs, all of whom have their own personality.- The game automatically pauses right before you're about to die, giving you time to take a health potion.- Multiple endings depending on your actions near the end of the game!Cons:- Lots and lots of dialogue.  They can be funny and helps to imbue the NPC with personality, but sometimes I just get bored and click through it rapidly.  Most of it isn't necessary for advancing the plot.- The final boss was a bit too easy.- I would really have liked to be able to explore the entire world after the story ends, so that I can continue my search for the silver feathers."

I had played an early access of the game from a while back and was anxious to see the full release.

Nice!)It is very tiny in terms of system resources, so no need for massive graphics cards or huge chunks of disk space. Just a nice clean but good-looking little game that should work like a champ on older rigs or laptops.Pretty decent handholding to get new players started, and you can't get much more straightforward than single-click combat :-) As several others noted, there is definitely a ""kid/family-friendly"" vibe, but it also kind of slips in a few wisecracks for the rest of us to keep it from being too cutesy.

And yes, this can be called a christian game, but like christian rock it is good or bad not because of the christian part. And actually you can choose to be an♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hero in this game if you wish so, so no moral values are pressed upon you.Anyways, the game itself would be average, it works well for what it is, but the small budget shows - it is a game made by two people. But what the game lacks in graphics it more than makes in story and characters. I don't think I ever liked game characters so much. And the story itself is cute and epic at the same time. It gave me the feeling of reading Narnia and LotR again with a really good sense of humor added to the mix.So in the end I want to personally thank  Ville Mönkkönen and Anne Mönkkönen, you guys made happy for the 12 hours I have played this game."

There are more than a few of the big games that have slight or small bugs with its UI but Driftmoon basically has none of them.Without spoiling anything, Driftmoon had a good and relaxing story, maybe a little more climactic for the younger audience, especially the RPG and item mechanics, but the story itself seemed to be rather good for all ages. Though, a bit predictable for those who are seasoned in stories, plots, and can guess at what's to come. The story includes many amusing scenes or quests as you come by them, though still for the younger audience it still made me laugh too.Driftmoon is most likely worth the $17 (CAD) if you're up for a good adventure story, just don't expect any fancy graphics from those $70 games to go along with it."

The game overall feels like it would be something I'd let my young child play if they were interested in a role-playing-game. The dialogue is very child like and the world is super colorful and vibrant. The combat is very easy (even on hard) and exploration is time consuming. The game functions though, and within its self it is fun to play, and fun to explore the environments. It feels like the type of game I'd hand my son for his first rpg. I don't feel like this game is for everyone, even hardcore rpg, dungeon crawler fans. It's an acquired taste.I'd give it a 7/10, because of the poor visuals, poor music, and child-like dialogue. It's definitely fun in its own ways, and I think that there is a select audience that will cherish this game."
,Recommended,263380,21190976,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,Nocturnalizer,"I really admire it when indie developers produce something impressive with little in the way of resources. Driftmoon fits into that category very well, having been made over a period of 7 years by a couple with children. That's an insane amount of time to dedicate to finishing a project, but the love, care and attention shown to the game has resulted in something quite interesting and special.Driftmoon is an RPG in the mold of Diablo, although very much simplfied and nowhere near as well polished. I'm not saying that to detract from the game, it's just the reality of having not much in the way of a budget and building an engine that isn't as powerful. While this game's combat sections leave something to be desired, where Driftmoons shines is in its strong writing and well-developed characters. There's nothing terribly original about the story, but it's all well-written and filled with funny, light-hearted moments. There are references to Monkey Island and The Hobbit woven in, and while these references are perhaps a little too on the nose it's still a sign of how much the two developers love these properties. You can feel a surge of passion and dedication throughout the experience.I managed to finish the game comfortably at nearly 9 hours in, and I did a lot of exploring and looking around for items. You could probably squeeze more hours out of the game by looking for all of the goldfish and the silver feathers, items you'll come to understand more about as you play, but I felt happy that I'd finished the game, completed all the quests and met some interesting, unique characters along the way. I definitely recommend Driftmoon, as its charms are easy to see even with all of the rough bits and lack of polish. This isn't a game you're playing for the looks or even a great combat system; you're playing for the journey and for the writing, and in those aspects Driftmoon is a strong success. Give it a go."

While I can see Driftmoon could become a great game one day, it's not currently in a very enjoyable state. I'm struggling to see at this stage what it's going to offer other than another playable, top-down Diablo-style RPG. The combat feels like an MMO, with auto-attack and skills about as far as it goes. It just doesn't feel like it's going to offer anything different or fresh at this stage. Additionally, this writing is verbose and hit-and-miss in my opinion. Some of the characters and conversations that are clearly intended to be funny fall flat and just seem plain wierd.

I really enjoyed this game, though I didn't finish it.PROS- Its filled to the brim with funny quips as you explore the world. Though a bit cheesy or quirky, it still made me smile.-Combat has many intersting abilities to keep things interesting.-World is very well fleshed-out and detailed. Many things to discover and collect - many sidequests.-Characters are fun, quirky and have nice portraits -  a nice touch. They are very optimistic and friendly, EVEN SKELETONS!-Story makes you go through many cool places - a nice adventure - and you even get companions sometimes! Don't forget boss fights!CONS-Music is amateurish from the get-go. Its kinda cute and happy, but it still got annoying after a while. Sound effects aren't great either.-Graphics aren't the prettiest, but coming from an indy dev, its to be expected.-Combat doesn't evolve very well. What I mean by that is that though you get many new abilities, there is no incentive to use them - you can just stick to 1-3 skills and wail on enemies along with your companions and phone it in.-Your saves aren't transfered over to the cloud. This was a big issue for me because my computer got a virus and I had to wipe everything. Unfortunatly, I lost all my progress and I never finished it.-No replayability. Its perfectly linear and has no branching paths. There might be other possibilities with the game engine, but I didn't check those out.-Puzzles are frustrating and clunky. Mainly they have to do with moving blocks around or whatever and it was just tedious and not fun.-No co-op.

76561197997030136,Recommended,263380,33912929,Posted: 30 July,all,Alysandir,"TLDR:A charming fantasy adventure RPG highly reminiscent of the classic masterpiece,  Ultima 7: The Black Gate (arguably the best of the series), albeit with more tongue-in-cheek humor.Review:Driftmoon is a 3rd-person isometric fantasy adventure game with light RPG elements that never takes itself too seriously. The plot is fantasy-standard stuff: village destroyed, chase down the big bad with the companions you acquire one-by-one, maybe even fall in love along the way, and it does so with tongue firmly planted in cheek. That's not to say that this is a silly game or a parody, but that the game has a very light-hearted feel to it, as opposed to say, Diablo or Dark Souls; this game doesn't want to punish you for playing it. I compare it to the masterpiece Ultima 7 both because they are each a mix of dark themes and humor, they each have the top-down oblique view of the world, but also because Ultima 7 was a clear inspiration in that the ""Hoe of Doom"" from Ultima 7 makes a cameo in Driftmoon.While there are a range of difficulties you can play at - to adjust the challenge of combat to your taste - the overall difficulty of the puzzles and exploration seems aimed at the new adventurer or casual RPGer, and I think it does it in a way that does not require the typical level grind pervasive in so many hardcore RPGs. In fact, the designers even provide a cheat for you to use at your discretion to boost your levels as you wish, should you be unable to overcome a particular boss; this is part of what I mean by a very light-hearted experience in that the game is fairly forgiving if you don't do things just right. There are also a mind-boggling number of add-ons provided with the game to tailor it to your desired experience.What I liked about Driftmoon:I liked the tone of the game; particularly with so many adventure games having a very dark feel to it.I liked that there was enough game here to provide almost 10 hours of entertainment without requiring me to spend hours grinding mobs to level up.I really liked the add-ons and user-designed levels that came with the game, that ultimately helped not only tailor the experience of the main game, but helped extend the play beyond the main game. Unfortunately, some of the user-designed experiences are better than others.What I didn't care for about Driftmoon:I felt that the differentiation between the combat skills you could acquire was not great. It felt like they were trying for different play styles but the balancing between the different play styles felt uneven. For example, the tools are there for you to be an archer, but the implementation is so clumsy so eventually give up and go bash the monster in the face.The silver feather collection mechanism was a bit too clunky for my taste, both in implementation and design. The game gives you no real reason to collect these, and as they can be a bit challenging to find, you may not even try all that hard to do so. Yet if you do not collect them in sufficient quantity, you'll deeply regret it later."
