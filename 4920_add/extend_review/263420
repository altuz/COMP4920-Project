76561198112469075,Recommended,263420,13397290,"Posted: 15 December, 2014",all,RedSky,"MY GOD THIS GAME! It took me almost two freaking hours to complete target practice, eight simple still targets. I can't even think about ADVANCED targets where they actually move around.The controls are god awful, half the time you're struggling to nock the friggin arrow because even though my hand is right on the string it says my arrow is too far to nock, because apparently your balloon head can't send the appropriate brain signals to your sack of potato body to complete a simple task! Then if you miss (witch you will, many many times) it's such a pain in the butt to draw your arrow and line your arms up correctly, and make a sad attempt at shooting. I could keeping going on on how bad the controls are but, for the sake of this review I'll leave it for you to experience. The game was meant to have bad controls after all.Despite how much I wanted to shoot myself with an arrow and end it all, I can't help but love it. I love the charm of the game and the feel of it, the sountrack is great, and it's a very humorous game.As much as I wanted to rage quit I persevered, and it felt so rewarding when I finally beat target practice. I could live in peace knowing I wasn't a failure at life. Once you think you get the feel for the game you are challanged with a whopping 10 game modes! (including Target Practice, Advanced Target Practice, The Berserker, Don't Miss, Warband witch is my personal favorite, Eggsterminator, The Noose, Zero G, Zombie Soccer, and Multiplayer). Each having their own unique premise and challanging your archery skills to the max!Do I recomend this game? Surprisingly I do, but that is IF you're up for the challange and how well you can handle rage inducing controls. Like I said it feels good when you manage to beat target practice or any of the others, I mean can you blame your potato sack for being such a horrible archer? Seriously if you're looking for a game that offers a challange look no farther. 7/10"
,Not Recommended,263420,9043206,"Posted: 10 February, 2014",all,nusensei,"I've played this game since the 7DFPS version and trialed the demo when it was on Greenlight. The concept of the game is unique and interesting, but the execution of the full release leaves a bit to be desired and seems to be a stray shot.Getting the hang of the controls is half the fun. However, once you understand how the bow and the arms work (as a veteran of Probably Archery, and probably a real-life archer), the challenge is significantly diminished since repetition of the correct technique is not at all difficult. Unless you're going for pinpoint accuracy and high scores, you can beat all the minigames within 20 minutes.The minigames need much more depth. There are several shooting gallery-like levels, with the more interesting ones including the charging Berserker and the Warband, and the need Eggsterminator one is a chuckle and the most fun. The problem is that these minigames are single-level experiences, with the exception of the Berserker, which only has four very quick levels. I don't imagine it's difficult to code in different levels for each minigame (different target layout, more challenges, etc.). Unfortunately, you'll get the feeling of ""Wait, that's it?"" when you complete a minigame.I can't get into any multiplayer games. I don't know whether it's because not many people are playing it, or not many people around me are playing it. Nonetheless, that seems to be where the most replay is, with Team Deathmatch and Horde Mode with multiple waves. But it'd be nice to have single-player versions of those too.I have no idea why Zombie Soccer is part of this game. It feels like a side-project tacked onto the game to add value. I haven't been able to actually play an online match, but it otherwise doesn't look or feel good.Basically, the game has good mechanics but poor replay value. There's simply no depth to the minigame experience. Most of the time spent in the game is figuring out how the controls work, but once you've mastered that, it's not something you'd probably go back to. In some ways, the free Greenlight Demo was more enjoyable -- and free. To pay ~$10 for this game, I'd expect more replay value."

,Not Recommended,263420,13957471,"Posted: 12 January, 2015",all,Alymon,"Probably Archery is amusing.  The controls are pretty horrendous, but that's kind of the point.  You struggle and try as hard as you can to figure it out, then fail miserable and fire an arrow straight into the ground... or the sky... or you accidentally drop it because you let go of the wrong button.I spent just under an hour playing the game.  In that time, I went from struggling to grasp what was needed and having trouble grabbing the bowstring to being able to fire off arrows rapidly (but with no accuracy or sense of direction).  After some practice, I was able to complete the basic targets.  I tried shooting the hangman's rope, but couldn't get the accuracy down in the short time you have to succeed.  I tried shooting an apple off of a person's head like William Tell.  It did not go so well.  Fun, but I managed to sink an arrow into the target's head and its neck instead of the apple.  I also tried shooting flying eggs in a china shop.  I managed to hit 6 before I was fired for breaking too much stuff.  I strongly recommend using a controller for the game.  I found it to be less frustrating than the keyboard/mouse.The primary reason I purchased it, however, was for the VR support.  Unfortunately, the game will not detect the Rift (DK2) and I have been unable to fix it.  The development team has also been quiet on and future support or updates, so it is hard to know if they will be doing anything about it.  I cannot recommend the game without knowing if bugs or issues will be fixed.So short version:Fun, frustrating game, but VR support is not working with DK2.  If you bought it for a fun, frustrating game like Surgeon Simulator, you'll be happy.  If you bought it for VR support, you'll be disappointed."

Plus there are too many zombies and the screen starts to skip at about 3 fps sometimes, no matter what the screen resolution is set at!Again, the controls for the bow are so bad, it makes the game unplayable at times!

Nocking the arrow is one of the more abysmal features, which could have worked, but there is no actual indicator of if you got it in right or not, seeing how I put the mid of the arrow against the middle of the bow, nothing happened there, but something happened touching it with the point of the arrow...Every single asset is stock-made, and I can't get that out of my head while playing the entire way through. Heard/seen them all before, and the full price says otherwise. Change it for honesty's sake.Okay, maybe one non-stock asset, the balloon guy... that face of doomsday's texturing and holey arms are just painful to look at.One thing to consider when you release a game like this... is this what you would spend on? Or is this better played on a free games hosting site? Compare your game to both of those, then to your own. This feels like a game I would play on a free games hosting site... I mean there are a good amount of game modes, so there are in plenty of those games on the hosting site. This game has no depth, goes as deep as your arrow flew, aiming around every joint in your arms to fire is about all they are centered around and don't go far beyond, seeing the only change is the targets.Learning the game started fun, but all you are learning further than how to shoot is just shoot faster... which you work out by yourself mind you. You might just need to stay in target practice for most of your time playing to get there, while all the other game types are tempting which you WILL lose at trying if you haven't gotten your speed to perfection... in a QWOP-styled game, where the aim isn't on completion for QWOP, this one here calls apon completing objectives... Re-play QWOP, devs. There is a bit you missed if you are referencing that at all.Now... that zombie soccer game thats slapped in hereI ran into a few bugs launching it, and more than I can stand for a launch.firstly, it loaded available servers. Saw one, then hit back to go back to the main menu... it connects me to that server on the list as I hit the back button.when I joined I actually could not join a team/play/do anything aside from alt-F4 my way out. Not boding well.in conclusion: Waste of all my resources getting to play this gameyou will start, you will see potential, then it will be shot down by your unwanted time just in training."

Gave it a hard try as I like the concept, but it is just way not ready yet.To get the arms to work takes a lot of time and effort.  I have hit a few targets , mostly out of luck.  my hopes for a game as described have been dashed."
