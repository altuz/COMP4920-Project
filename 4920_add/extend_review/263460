,Recommended,263460,10983201,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,baja gaijin,"This is one of the most insane puzzle games I've ever played. The mechanics are simple: you have a grid of X by Y squares, place your pieces down in a way that everyone likes who they're seated beside (the basic rule of the game: Girls like Robots. Girls don't like Nerds. Nerds like Girls, Robots, but not other Nerds).Except then suddenly you're learning that June actually really likes Bugs. But Bugs don't like Girls. And Ben likes June, so make sure to leave a space near June for Ben so he can ask her out, and...The game's complexity builds slowly, and it comes through adorably quirky cutscenes. It also has 3 tiers of medal per stage, but in a twist I absolutely adore, ""gold"" does not mean ""perfect"" - it just means ""the highest"". This is one of those games where the designer didn't go through and mathematically 'solve' every stage and expect you to do the same, and that goes a long way for me in saying ""This is the kind of game devoted to fun first, humor second, and everything else is just a bonus"".Plus, if you score enough golds and things, you unlock alternate silly modes. I'm waiting to see what Nerd Drop is.edit: Infinite Nerd Drop is everything I wanted from the name."

The puzzles get more difficult as you get further into the levels, but the hilarity of the 'plot' and the reasoning.... Girls like robots, nerds like edges, girls are only okay with nerds if there is an adjacent pie.... Just a quirky unrealistic logic game, but hey, who knows! Maybe some girls really do like pie THAT MUCH. Turn it around from a way to a man's heart is through his stomach.... now it's a way to sit next to a girl is through an adjacent pie. It's definitely some good laughs with some 'wtf logic' moments."

Basically, you have to arrange the people in the way the game demands; Girls like the robots, robots like the girls, nerds like the robots and the edge of the playing field and, last but not least, the girls don't want to benearthe nerds.  It's all straightforward until you begin to realize that this isn't a linear, repetitive game.  No, the developers keep throwing new things at you in order to keep it fresh.  This made it extremely entertaining the entire playthrough.The music isn't too bad, but at times it could be repetitive.  Then again, I was focusing like a madman on the puzzles and the art (the square people are cute, ok!?) so the music didn't really capture my attention that much.All in all, a good puzzle game for the price and an enjoyable one at that.  I recommend it to anyone interested and I hope they find the same amount of enjoyment that I did in the game."

76561198065409824,Recommended,263460,9118697,"Posted: 15 February, 2014",all,UN Peace Summit,"Very fun, little, casual puzzle game.  The art style is playful and vibrant with a wonderful attention to detail, especially in the backgrounds.  The animations were smooth and fun to watch, as a feature the game also allows the player to skip the cutscenes or even watch the cutscenes again in the level viewer.  The story was surprisingly well done as well. Normally, I would not expect a story in a puzzle game like this, however there was a story, and it was quite easy to follow.  Though the adventures were wacky and didn't make any logical sense, it fit the overall tone of the game perfectly.  I must also applaud the creators of the game for adding little references from other media and of course geek culture.  The soundtrack of this game was great, however it got very repetitive as the game progressed, for my ears got tired of hearing the same banjo tune strummed over and over again.  The best way to remedy this problems is to take a break once in a while to let your ears rest.  However this little problem did not and will not dull the rest of the gaming experience in anyway.The game was easy to pickup and play, however don't get me wrong, some of the puzzles will take a little bit of thinking to figure it out, especially if you are a completionist.  Bonus content allows for some replayability which adds to the value of the game itself and in no ways detracts from the main game itself.  The system of unlocking bonus content is well done, as even an intermediate skilled player will be able to ""buy"" the content (The main game will provide more than enough ""happy"" points to unlock them).  The achievements brings nothing new to the table, but it fairly awards those who are willing to spend some time in the game.Overall this is a solid game with little to no faults to describe.  It is a must own for people who like puzzle games, and for people who don't, this is a good game to pick up, because of its ease of play.  The game's content to value ratio is good, however don't expect to sink hundreds of hours into this game.  9/10"

It's all based on arranging various pieces that react differently to their adjacent pieces.  Which sounds simple, and it mostly is, but the developper showed a lot of wit and creativity in the game's design, and it's very well refined.Only problem is that it's a bit short, but the ride is plenty enjoyable and, I think, well worth the price."

This game is basically rearranging chairs in a room to have everybody as happy as possible. The game throws around different objectives as you progress in the story mode, sometimes having to make people angry, or get distracted by pie. The story was warm and silly, and helps keep the pace of the game's puzzle stages nicely. Without trying to perfect the boards you can beat the game in under a couple hours, so get this on a sale. Also the music is stuck in my head, in a good way."

It's not a game for everyone, but I was surprised to find out that it was a game for me.Some things about the game might seem tedious, but they sort of break away if you overcome the difficulty curve and truly learn how to play. It also helps to get into the mind of every character and understand what they like and dislike, rather than memorize a series of patterns.The soundtrack is very folksy, and I happen to love folk music. I don't think everyone else can appreciate that, but that is a factor to consider before getting this game as a gift for a friend or loved one. Also, I appreciated how it was Safe For Work and at times amusing."

So, that means trial and error until you get the perfect/good enough combination to pass the level.Ah ! and as you've probably noticed while watching the trailer, this game also has a bit of humor ... enjoy !"

,Recommended,263460,9133746,"Posted: 15 February, 2014",all,Bieeanda,"A decent puzzle game with a cute presentation, but some annoyances as well. Under the hood it's all math: each of your square figures has a like/dislike relationship with every other one, and score is kept based on which faces are in contact at any given time. This is only explained briefly, once, though there's a button to show current relationships on a colour scale instead.Things become more complicated when you're forced to place tiles in a specific order. Things become annoying when, doing one of these puzzles, you realize that in order to correct a mistake made a dozen turns ago, you have to undo all twelve moves. Tile swapping puzzles present a similar challenge in that you're only given a certain number of moves, and a similar annoyance in having to restart if you realize that you've fouled things up royally.Unfortunately, the developers decided to throw timed minigames into the mix, and make them part of the scoring/unlocking scheme for the bonus puzzle levels. They're skippable, but again, they're tied into the system that unlocks bonus levels. This kind of thing baffles me-- these games are supposed to be brain teasers, not repetitive, fast-paced drills.Despite those gripes, I definitely recommend this title. There are dozens of puzzles in varying formats, and the whole thing is very well presented."
,Recommended,263460,26600136,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,Gamesjunkie,"Cute puzzle game but the difficulty is not well balanced. Some chapters were quite easy and others I really struggled with. I would have enjoyed this game more overall I'd been allowed to place and switch squares as much as I liked. Call it easy mode if you like but some of the movement restrictions, while I understand were part of the challenge, felt more frustrating than fun. There is a complete walkthrough available which helped keep my puzzle rage in check.I don't want to give this a negative review as I found it a charming puzzler overall. Just keep in mind that you will probably be reaching for a walkthrough in some sections. And if you're better than me and don't need the help you may find it a little short. I would recommend waiting for a sale to buy this one."
,Recommended,263460,17152129,"Posted: 20 July, 2015",all,LeonRes,"July 21, 2015Girls Like Robots is fueled by silliness and delightful writing. Despite being a logic puzzle, the world is an entirely crazy place. But the game succeeds at developing a personality without pushing the absurdity too far. It may appear like a mobile game, but it feels very solid on PC.The game is a fairly casual puzzle, involving interactions between character pieces. Each group of levels focuses on new mechanics, introducing them smoothly and keeping the game fresh. Each group uses the story to justify rule changes, with some levels focused on getting the lowest score possible. The game stays fresh and hardly feels repetitive. Some levels did cause me trouble, mostly the five or so levels with a time limit. The music is solid and relaxing, but some songs can be repetitive. Sound effects are often hilarious, and still make me smile after playing the game to completion.A sense of humor is needed for Girls Like Robots, as you can't take it seriously. It's a lovely game with a great personality, and strong gameplay to keep it going. It's perfect for a fan of puzzles and silly comedy. With the full price of $7 USD, I'm willing to recommend it to everyone."

It has very positive reviews and an adorable trailer. I bought it for the fun of the puzzles and because I liked the art style. However, by the end of it, I found it to be tedious and unlikable.

There were a lot of good parts to it, but it was not satisfying overall from a completionist perspective. Girls Like Robots has left a bad taste in my mouth that I could not, in good conscience, wish unto others. Looking at the global achievement stats and seeing that only 17% of players have even finished the first act, I think that others have also had a negative experience.

But I'm not a girl and I enjoyed it. It's a fun little game you can play for a couple minutes or an hour.Yes the single music track gets annoying after a while - muting it is easy though.Total game time for me was about 6 hours, since I tried a lot of levels over again to get a better score.
