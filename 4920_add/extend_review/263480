,Recommended,263480,11109008,"Posted: 6 July, 2014",all,TotalChaos935,"NOTE: This is for v2.10. I will try to update my review as more updates come out. The game is now out of Early Access!Rating at the moment: 8.5/10Final Rush is a Sci-fi FPS game, which at the moment, only has Co-op and singleplayer. The game mode at the moment, Rush, has you and up to 3 teammates battling 10 waves of robots. It's like Killing Floor and COD: Zombies. As the rounds progress, you are met with an increasing amount of difficulty and diversity of robots. At the moment, there are 9 weapons to choose from, 8 upgrades, and 5 different levels. The weapons options and upgrades are good.Types of robotsandtypes of weapons and upgradesEDIT: The guides are out-of-date, but it's the only guides there are and they have most of it covered.- Settings?: Here's screenshots of them:AudioVideoResolution goes from 320 x 200 to your screen's resolution. Anisotropic Filtering goes from 2X to 16X. Anti Aliasing goes from FXAA0 to FXAA3ControlsYou can change them.GamePlayFor purchasing game before price drop.- Visuals?: Visually, this game looks amazing. The animations look a little weird, but other than that it's great.- Sound?: The sound is alright, but it sounds a little wierd with this new update.- Bugs?: There are thankfully not much bugs. I've only seen around 4.- Singleplayer?: You are able to play by yourself, but so far the only thing to do is play Rush. The game is very difficult playing by yourself and there aren't much people that play this game.- Multiplayer?: It's you and up to 3 people battling robots. There are a few dedicated servers, but barely anybody that playsthis game.That being said, they did an amazing job with multiplayer. It's really fun to play with other people and earn some friends. You can get cornered a lot though, so make sure you have a mic to help yourself and others out. You can make your own dedicated servers.- Customization?: They have now added a customization tab in the main menu. When you level up, you earn more armor options, skills, and gun upgrades. You can buy these using the points you earn from beating games and leveling up. There are about 4 options for each armor piece, including head, bodym shoulders, legs, and boots. You can upgrade your guns to increase mag size, damage, etc. You can buy skills to make you run faster, reload faster, etc. There are around 25 skills.- Content?: There are now 5 levels, around 9 weapons, around 8 upgrades during each match, 1 gamemode, multiple achievements, tradings cards, leveling up, and customization for your player and weapons. This game could use more content and workshop support, but it has enough to earn a quite a few fun hours. What they need is more gamemodes and levels. In MY opinion, they only need more levels, weapons, and workshop support.- Replayable?: Somewhat repeatable, you should be able to get quite a few good hours into it. The addition of achievements, trading cards, and more have made this game more fun replayable (if that's a word). The addition of customization of characters, guns, skills, and even leveling up have definitely made the game more fun and intresting.- Developers?: I'm very happy to say that the developers have delivered this update, and it is looking wonderful. There have been more updates and they continue to deliver what they promised they would. With more graphic options and improved visuals. I like the Path of Development so far, and I do wish them luck. They are active in the forums and they do respond to peoples problems. Sometimes, their response can even be humerous.- What is Needed?:Workshop supportMore content (guns, upgrades, levels, etc.)More players (which they can't really change :/)The ability to crouchAn improved scoreboardVoting systemIncrease in amount of players allowed in each game (4 right now)# of robots determined by players- Verdict?: The game is actually quite fun. There is a lack of content and multiplayer could be improved, but they will do that in the future. I recommend getting this game now. If none of your friends play, convince them too or just ask people in discussions to play or ask me. People will be eager to play and I hope it will work out for you."

I like the visuals and the robot comments they make when shot, and the ways their bodies slump around in robot garbage heaps when taking them down. Yes, there is not a whole lot of variety in the enemies and some weapon balancing is in order, but there is a foundation here for a really fun coop experience. So far i just have a few personal gripes that arnt very big fixes but would make things much smoother atm.-first and most importantly, get real multiplayer going between steam friends ASAP. I have 2 friends myself that ive managed to sell this too, but they won't buy until they have multiplayer other than LAN-allow custom key bindings (i know it looks like you can, but everytime i set keys differently, they just reset to normal upon leaving menu)-A ""jump"" would be nice. Let's face it, when you play fps games nowadays, the ones who ""ground"" you with no jump feel as if there is something lacking mobilitywise the whole time.Anyways, i do really enjoy this game and can see the potential like i said.Keep up the good work!-"

No story or cutscenes etc. Robots just keep coming harder and faster and bigger, while you improve your weaponry and features.Control and gameplay are excellent, though still lacking in movement options like all fps games these days (can't move much while shooting; can't sprint and strafe).Weapon options are quite good. You start with a choice of shotty, assault rifle, battle rifle, and the weaponry builds from there.The middle tier weapon options could include a true auto smg, but it'll get there I'm sure. The shotguns seem OP.Anyway, jump in; grab a gun; shoot until you die!"
,Not Recommended,263480,8748152,"Posted: 17 January, 2014",all,The Bacon One,"-Release review--Scroll to bottom for an up-to-date review.--OLD REVIEW[YES I KNOW ITS AN ALPHA]100% Honest review.I would not reccomend this game in its current state. I bought it on a whim and quit after surviving 3 waves, There isn't a server browser but there is a LAN option. Gameplay is repetitive and boring, Just wave after wave of killing boring enemies with a limited use of weapons. There isn't any character customization, story nor different game modes. Maybe after 6+ Months of updates it would be worth purchasing but in its current state; HELL NO!In all honesty this game isn't worth buying even with -33% or even -75% off.I managed to last 1 hour, After 15 minutes I was bored, There isn't anything new or exciting at all older games such as Killing Floors (Even thought it is a slightly different genre, the concept it very similar) is much better. There is no character progression you just survive each round save up and buy a new weapon. That is pretty much the entire game in a nutshell.I feel pretty much robbed at this point. I'd expect a lot better than this even for an early access game.. a total mistake buying this even whilst on sale feels like a cheap cash grab even after being under development for 2 years. I own a lot of early access games both with and without steam and this is in my top 5 rubbish list, I've already unistalled it and will give it ago 8 months down the line.Also if you're using the shotgun you have to keep spamming R to reload, and it only reloads one shell at a time which is kinda annoying when you're trying to keep an eye out for the enemies. You can't even jump in this game, The environment is pretty standard and doesn't stand-out anywhere noticably. The devs say its their first game out of the studio and it shows, A good attempt but lacks content and there isn't a reason to even play it after 3 waves.Even when loading up the game for the first time it states there is a game update so I click on the update button and it loads up a web page stating that there isn't an update? O.oEdit: Reponse to developer (Also posted in comments)Hello developer,I'm happy to receive a response directly from a developer, during the last couple of years  with game studios both big and small struggling I can to some degree understand your viewpoint.I'm also glad to see that the game will continue to be developed as I was worried from what I had seen (v1.00) and the dates surrounding the release and development.Multiplayer nowadays is certainly a must when it comes to first person shooters and being a game launched on steam I personally believe it is very important to have some kind of server browser regardless of what format and I am also hopeful now that the server option is being worked on.I may have come across a little bit harsh in my review but for a small studio graphically I believe the game is quite solid. Environment features such as exploding barrels, laser trip mines & different types of grenades (Example. EMP & Damage over time grenades) aside from the regular fragmentation grenades. The ability to jump would also significantly improve player-environment interaction (Example. Climbing onto boxes when cornered etc)I will be checking back time to time on this game and even though my review was negative I believe that this could be a decent to great game.I'd love to have a chat sometime and discuss some small ideas that I personally think would benefit the overall experience of the game.Lastly I'd like to thank you for the offer of a 15 dollar steam game of my choice and it is this type of developer to customer communication that just goes to show that even small studios care what their customers think and not just about sales figures.-----------Update----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've downloaded and played it again to see what all these updates are!There has definitively been some progress, The GUI revamp is nice!The enemy AI is more intelligent.It interested me enough to actually beat wave 10. (The game)I couldn't test out the Multiplayer because no servers would show up in the server browser?Still lacking in content but it is definitively improving.Is it worth the price tag? Nearly!--------Update-2------------------------So the multiplayer is now working there are two servers up with a maximum for 4 players (A little disappointing but meh, its okay)Both servers were empty, after playing to wave 6 and dying it was +1 person +1 person coming in.It was okay - But I have two BIG gripes with the multiplayer.1. -Respawn lives are shared by ALL.Meaning that if some scrub joins your team and wastes all of your lifes during wave 1 and 2 you're pretty much screwed.2. The STUN bots are OP.I like the concept and the stuns.. but the stun time does need to get NERFED.Even when you're not swarmed you'll be screwed over.nearly all maps fill the same, all close-quarter corridor styled maps..The different maps are nice, but they feel all the same.3. The RANKS.Seriously? I've played 4-5 games and it seems like ranking up it going to take 3-4 months just for the second rank... Do they really expect people to grind day in day out for these ranks?4. Limited weapon types.They are all pretty much stuck into 3 catergories.Sniper, Assault rifle and Shotgun.Pretty standard, pretty dull.How about adding additional catergories? Such as STUN weapons, STUN grenades more AoE weaponary or heck deployables?!5. Multiplayer teams.there is not type of 'voting' in multiplayer which WILL have a negative impact on the player experience.What happens if somebody is AFK on your team? How do you vote-kick them?What happens if somebody on your team is just griefing and dying on purpose?6. Robots - More creative entrances..How about them dropping down from Vents? Coming up some conveyer belts like a production line churning them out.What about some kind of WEILD tools so you can temporarily hold positions?How about custom player-made emblems for communities and just regular teams?"

They say a polished turd is still a turd; I have no evidence to refute that claim.This is a very strait forward, run of the mill wave based shooter. It has your assault, recon and support classes. Your rifle, sniper, and shotgun with some variations in armor sort of base differences. You shoot robots on various maps while collecting currency to refill health/ammo as well as buy upgrades and different weapons.There is no limb damage, aside from head shots doing slightly more damage. The basic enemies as well as even most of the “higher” tier enemies just sort of stoically proceed in your general direction and swipe at you. (Some have guns.) I thought at one point I had done some limb damage to one of the enemy robots as it had a broken arm; I later discovered this was just a different marker for a suicide robot. Having a limb damage system I realize would have taken time to implement and possibly too much to ask for a small studio; however having it a game wherein enemies are constantly “at” you, mitigating or impeding their monotonousness onslaught might have lentsomeadditional strategy other than “shooting all the things”.The enemies will occasionally spawn behind you in the proverbial “monster cave”. A section of map designed to obfuscate from the player that enemies are being spawned into the environment. There is no environmental damage aside from bullets decals and the occasional red explosive barrel.The guns feel weak, the enemies unresponsive to not only your presence but your attacks. Getting trapped in a corner with little or no ammo is certain death.At times, the screen shakes while firing your weapon that seems ostensibly an effect to obfuscate the fact the weapons are ill-contrived for the task at hand. This effect was so violent and accosting to my eyes it truly fooled me into thinking my weapon was an effective means of dispatching these mini terminators.THE GISTThere just isn't much substance to this and the gameplay is rather boring and tedious; While simultaneously not being very satisfying when it does (sort of) work.The 4th law of robotics is to shoot them all when they stop taking orders. Or perhaps more accurately, when they stop taking YOUR orders.Follow my curation for more"
76561197996270838,Recommended,263480,13177888,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,WailingMonarch,"Quick summary: A nifty small game worth a few dollars and a few hours. Never have I yelled ""Don't tase me bro"" with such sincerity and volume. As of 12/1/2014 what you pay is what you get, no microtransactions or DLC.No proper tutorial to point out the games features. Especially the UI.For example: Health is of course located at the top along with a ""shield"" however health is segmented, and as you take damage your health regens only a segment. In order to fully regen your health you need to either sprint to the health station or purchase an upgrade at the store via the somewhat hidden upgrade tab. I found the upgrade tab after maybe 3 failed games.Levels are rather ho-hum. Little bits of moving machinery here or there to give some 'life"" but theres no awe. Which helps in a a way, no real distractions while fighting. Levels feel legit like factories/storage units in which there would be plenty of robots. However they feel like legit factories and storage units, rather dull but serviceable.Currently there are 8 enemy types each having their own range of somewhat charming taunts,Of which only one you will learn fear from. The taser-bot. You will feel the dread of Sarah Connor meeting the terminator in the 2nd movie as you are approached by its blue tinted fury.  As far as the rest of the cast goes, they lack any real intimidation or ""character"". Which yea I get ""robots, what character?"" but it does leave ya wanting when games like Leaft 4 Dead and all of its Boomers, spitters, Tanks and whatnot exist.You can have a total of 3 weapons by the end of a ""Rush"", your side arm, your main, and an ""alternative weapon"". Weapons feel about as good as they can when shooting against wire and metal, though a rather lacking selection of guns may put you off. 3 upgradeable weapons (standard shotgun, rifle, and sniper-esqu rifle) and 1 upgradeable side arm are what you choose between entering a match. As you play each match you accumulate points to spend at the shop which allows you purchase a standard/all around upgraded version of the starting selectable weapons (main), two preference weapons (alt), and two ""experimental weapons"" (alt). The experimental weapons provide a sort of ""reward play"" as they become accessable after so many rounds of accumulated points, you may destroy hordes of robots with dangerous lobs of lightning or incinerate them with essentially a laser cannon.Your 4 upgradeable weapons are manageable in the combat profile screen, there you can view and customize your weapons and character though only somewhat. Armor is purely for looks, mix and match as you unlock, some weapons have alternative firing modes however scopes give ""recoil reduction bonuses"" which should be a pure cosmetic choice not a somewhat forceful upgrade. Aside from firing modes, the upgrade paths of weapons are linear. Your character also has a skill tree, after obtaining the trainee perks your able to choose 3 of 6 (plus 1 required) perks from each branch of Assault, Ranger and Support. While respec-ing is easy enough, its a shame they don't let you have multiple pre-sets of perks. The perks in question generally give damage or accuracy buffs or give a grenade or ammo clip ever 2 minutes. Nothing too amazing but the choices are decent choices as opposed to a blantantly better perk to choose from that its been paired with.Picked up while it was 25% off looking for a cozy little FPS to play. The game needed some option tweeking before I could find a comfortable spot. Despite all the wish fors and occasional bugs, its a neat little time sink. Definately needs a shooting range mode or something to let players get somewhat comfy with weapons and settings."

I can see it potentially getting to that point, but it's not there yet.Missing are a wider variety of robot behaviors, weapon impact, and interesting environments.The robots tend to plod in your general direction in predictable ""robotic"" waves.  Maybe that's by design, but it is so basic that it gets boring quickly.Weapons lack punch, which is probably due a combination of muted visuals and sound design.  The customization and weapon variety look like they could be fun, but right now there's just no impact from your shots.  A shotgun should FEEL like a shotgun.It's a sci-fi setting, but the metal corridors and rooms are just too clean and symmetrical to create varied encounters...especially combined with robotic waves.Needs some more spit and polish, but there's potential for the setting/concept."

Unless your going to buy 4 for your buddies this game is not worth buying. You can't get anywhere in single player alone. The basic enemies are simply not ballanced for it. You need a freind to even get past wave 7. The guns just simply suck. I had to constantly be reloading while running away because you can't out-walk any enemies and you can't shoot them fast enough to stand your ground even on wave 1. You have to aim inorder to hit anything however while your doing that there will always be an enemy behind you just waiting for you to walk into it. This game had very few things going for it like it has bots as enemies which is hard to find in an fps. Beyond that it is just a simple verson of killing floor.

Perhaps for someone wo enjoys a challenge this was a good thing, but to me, it was smply no fun. What was worse than the gameplay was the fact that the game did not feature Steam multiplayer, and my friends and I who bought this game for the sole purpose of playing it together realized that we just wasted our money."

The game has good potential (more like minigame, really), but it's barely being worked on, if that. The graphics are fantastic, but something within the game makes the game very unstable making it likely to crash and overall lag. All you do is shoot robots like you would in a Call of Duty Zombies match and spend in-game money on weapons and weapon upgrades. There is no story nor other gameplay options, and is worth at most $5.00 USD just for the good graphics. Even then, the animations are quite unfinished and need working on. If the creators of this game decide to start updating the game more often or at all, then I'd recommend keeping a watch on the game to see if it becomes worth playing, then you can purchase it if you wish."

The game play is forgetable and lacking. It is almost impossible to play the game with your friends. You need to click on the join button about 100 times before anything happens. Also there is no lobby for your friends to join and there was a total of two people playing online at 6:30pm. Do not buy. Do not waste your money, memory, or time."

It is missing a crouch ability, which doesn`t feel quite right, but a real game is here. A game in the vein of Killing Floor. First (real) version that is properly representative of what it aspires to be. KF folk should give it a look."

I really think this game has potential for a cool indie game. I have also learned that this is made by Strike Games and is there first game so i highly recommend to support them. And you'll have a lot of fun doing it.

Right now there's not much content, but I really enjoyed the setting of this game, in later updates I would want to be able to aim down the sights, otherwise why do we have red dot on the weapon. Also, I belive if there'll be more cool movements for the player, like some parkour jump and firing while you fly and add some slo-mo for singleplayer, and for co-op as well. For sci-fi, action filled dupstep would be perfect I think. I pretty much know that more weapons are coming, so it'll be better to make weapon sounds more depper and more epic. And if you planning to work on enemy, make them not just walk towards player like a zombie, but maybe some droids,who can run jump from 1-st floor to 2-nd. And of course, graphics are high detail and that blue filter really is in place. More epicness for this already awesome game, and it'll be one of the ""Co-Op Must-Buy"" games. Like I already said-awesome game, really liked it. Keep up with the good work."

I can't play it for more than a few minutes, because the sound effect that plays when you get multipliers (such as for getting headshots) is so much louder than the rest of the game that it gives me a headache. I tried to communicate this problem to the developer before writing a review, and he quickly released a patch to 'fix' it, but it's still awful. How awful? I recorded some of the gameplay audio to check it out, the BAMNFFF sound effect is a full TEN DECIBELS louder than anything else in the game (if you aren't knowledgable about audio editing, 10 decibels is a huge difference in volume).Other than that, the only enemy type that appears for the first couple waves is a generic looking robot with animations that look like they were done by a child. They have a huge amount of health compared to first-wave enemies in typical wave-based shooters, which I guess makes the game unique, but I just find them silly and annoying. Getting cornered and killed by a mob of these absurdly animated robots just feels ridiculous.The three starting weapons all feel very lackluster; if you like memorable gunplay, this probably isn't the game for you, although it's possible some of the purchasable weapons have a better feel.The graphics are nice for an indie game, nothing mindblowing, but far better than, say, Killing Floor. If only anything else in the game could hold a candle to games like Killing Floor.I probably have less than an hour logged but that was more than enough time to tell this is by far the worst wave shooter I've ever played. Take my opinion how you will, but I will say based on my experience that this game is a joke, the developer doesn't seem to have good taste or know what he's doing (and doesn't understand why professional gaming news sources won't give him the time of day), and you can get far better co-op gameplay for a lower price elsewhere. Not to mention everyone on the forum reports the game is dead and there's no one to multiplayer with."
