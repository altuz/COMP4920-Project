,Recommended,263560,11708953,"Posted: 14 August, 2014",all,d.Tox508,"For every horrible game that Kickstarter is responsible for, their’s always one that breaks the mold and stands out. I remember supporting Paper Sorcerer from the beginning stages when it was still in Kickstarter, waiting patiently for the day that I would finally be able to play this masterpiece. Its hard for a game to be so simple and complex at the same time, yet Paper Sorcerer seems to do just that. What you might think is a plain and boring video game ends up coming to life and involving you deep into the plot.My first thoughts and impressions had me thinking that this game was obviously going to be totally awesome. I knew I had to have it after watching only the KS trailer, and once it made its way to Steam I was all over it. Within the first 5 minutes I was reminded of Dungeons & Dragons, playing with friends and calling out tactical moves. The turn based fighting system is well thought out and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Over are the days of the 3 minute bash sessions of games like Pokemon or Final Fantasy; Paper Sorcerer delivers tactical, powerful and serious battle sequences lasting longer than your average role player. The story line is action filled, as well as giving you the ability at points to choose what direction the scenes will go.“A powerful sorcerer is on the cusp of dominating the land. A group of heroes bands together and seals him away inside a magical tome. Now as the sorcerer you must escape from this ancient prison and find a way to regain your magical powers using your wits and an array of summonable creatures to aid you. There may be more powerful forces at work as you navigate the dungeons and fight the heroes sent to subdue you… Paper Sorcerer is a stylish turn based RPG focused on strategy, party-building, and environmental puzzles. Fight with the skills and spells you have learned in a battle system that emphasizes strategy over grinding. Assemble a party of monsters and dark creatures to fight alongside you. Explore and solve environmental puzzles to unlock secret paths and find extra loot.” – Paper SorcererGraphically this game must have been more challenging to animate than it would seem. With basically only 2 monochrome colors to work with, Paper Sorcerer is a artistic masterpiece and plays out more like a graphic novel than a video game. Although you have full navigation as the game is in the first person, on my 32 inch its like playing a giant fairy tale book that’s come to life. The subtle use of color throughout the game is genius and fits perfectly, from the effects of spells to the health and energy bar every detail has been covered. Each battle is reminiscent of the older Final Fantasy, where instead of the hero moving and performing each command, its represented by a small graphic, color or sound. As I’ve said in the past, its the simplicity that can make a game as good as it is, and that is certainly the case with Paper Sorcerer. The imagery in this game is absolutely amazing, and the use of essentially 2 colors is almost intoxicating.Paper Sorcerer is as fun as it is challenging. I like games like these because the battles later in game are hard, but you’ve been prepared by several battles before it so you have an idea what you’re in for. I really enjoyed the turn based fighting system because each member of your party has a role that is greatly needed during battle. Party formation is one of the toughest parts of early game, and essential to continued play in later levels. You will need a tank, healer, and a ranged hero to make it anywhere (you already have magic covered, as you are a sorcerer), and Paper Sorcerer certainly gives you that option with a choice of several different heroes to choose from. Items are pivotal to game play, equipping each of your heroes with the proper weapons, shields and runes are key to completing each floor. Fighting is very important, because this game doesn’t focus solely on damage to end battles, you need to play more tactfully and use skills to buff strength and agility while making sure you keep your defense up.Its the little things that count sometimes in a game that make or break it. One of these things is the difficulty setting when you first begin your game; you’re given the options Easy, Medium, Hard & 1980’s. The first time around, i chose 1980’s for the hell of it… lets just say that your first battle which is almost a guaranteed win, is a guaranteed loss. This was obviously a setting for the more experienced players of Paper Sorcerer. About the only thing I really didn’t like about the game other than the fact you cant use a controller, is the music. I have no idea who is responsible for it, but it needs a major overhaul and update. It just doesn’t fit well with the game whatsoever.When it comes down to it, Paper Sorcerer is a great game, and highly suggested. So many different elements hold this game together making it a solid play through. Loaded with secrets and strong attention to detail, each item counts, and every room needs inspecting. Retro like an old D&D MSDos game and as modern as a new age RPG, everything about Paper Sorcerer is entertaining.Graphics: 7/10Playability: 7/10Story: 7/10Challenge: 7/10Replay Value: 7/10"

,Not Recommended,263560,8963032,"Posted: 3 February, 2014",all,nameoftheyear,"I'm a big fan of old-school dungeon crawlers, but Paper Sorcerer ultimately attempts to crib a lot from 2009's The Dark Spire, and instead delivers a buggy and underdeveloped slog. The trailer, screenshots, and overall aesthetic are impressive to be sure, but they belie a cumbersome user interface (for a genre that is 90% menus, why are the menus so annoying to use?), a sluggish battle system, and overall very dull mechanics that offer little in the way of exciting character molding or customization. A dungeon crawler must dangle the excitement of pushing forward and advancing your characters bit by bit, but Paper Sorcerer's skill system has no appeal and the battles are a chore of poorly-telegraphed information and so, so much waiting.I want to like this game, and I truly do appreciate the efforts to bring more dungeon crawlers to the market, but Paper Sorcerer is a meandering and unfocused product in serious need of more thought-out game design and revised UI design.As a $5 game, it is admittedly worth a try, even with the simplistic gameplay & numerous bugs (none of them game-breaking so far, at least) -- but if you value your time even moreso, my suggestion is to try out Legend of Grimrock on Steam or The Dark Spire on DS, two games in the same style that deliver a much more captivating experience.In short: be wary. The paper aesthetic is so fresh and appealing that it's easy to assume the rest of the game is just as polished, but unfortunately the core gameplay is miles behind what I would expect from a 2014 Wizardry-like. Will you find it fun? It's hard to predict -- but if you keep up with the scant few post-2000 dungeon crawlers like I have, the answer will probably be No, because Paper Sorcerer decidedly does not want to do anything unique with the core genre."

You are a powerful being that has been trapped inside a magical book. Very happy with the purchase and would like to see more games of this quality at such low asking prices. (it was practically a give away in the winter sale but my review is based on its full price). I'm not a fan of the 8 bit chip music but thankfully that changes as the game progresses. High level of tactical choice for your party and equipment can radically add to the high level of customisation. Plenty of secrets and varied boss fights. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like it.*edit* It does crash now and then due to transitions not completing as they should so save often just to be safe because it can be very frustrating when this happens after you found some rare gear.

This is a great FP dungeon crawler RPG, heavily influenced by some of the best old school games such as the Wizardry titles. Very unique looking art design, and most importantly: no hand holding at all! The enemies offer fun challenges, it's not just generic trash mobs, with each level having its own unique elements and combat will require some use of tactics. There are different companions you can choose from, with many different viable party set-ups. Each main level has optional puzzles and hidden secrets; exploration is very enjoyable. The only downside is perhaps the music, which I thought didn't really fit the game. It would have been a much more atmospheric experience had the music been darker, more suspenseful. I chose to mute it and play to the Fallout 1 soundtrack ^^"

From what I've read the game was pretty much developed by one person.  Running a kickstarter, developing a game and then getting it published to Steam is a real accomplishment.I wanted to like this game.Due to technicial issues though I cannot recommend Paper Sorcerer.The game freezes and I've had to replay levels due to the game locking - this is the primary reason I can't recommend it.Sometimes it doesn't size the screen correctly to display menus or images.You cannot adjust game volume that I've found other than manually via headset or windows volume.Paper Sorcerer does have good traits:The sketch style art was enjoyable and well placed with the conceit of the gameIt's fun to play the bad guy and summon monstersThe RPG mechanisms were good although somewhat opaqueSadly in the condition it's in I personally cannot recommend it.

Pleasant to look at both because it is different and nice.But otherwise, I found the gameplay very repetative. The first levels are fun, but then I realized as I progressed, that the only differences were a slight change in the surroundings, enemies and music. Combat is always the same, and most fights end up being repeating one or two different combinations of skills from your four characters.What I found most fun about this game was the secret hunting. Not very difficult, but it was more or less the only thing that varied across the levels.The story was presented in text, but I didn't experience any depth in it. The whole idea of it is different and entertaining, but it is presented casually, and after a short while I couldn't get rid of the feeling that it is just a context to put the game in without any farther meaning.I haven't finished the game, but I keep trying to progress to see if it may have anything else to offer, as it seems pretty long. But repeating the same combat sequences for 9 hours of gameplay appears demotivating. I can still recommend to try this game just for the visual style and some old school atmospherics, but I don't thik it is worth spending more than a few hours on."

Entertaining, but not without flaws though :- The UI is frankly terrible- The graphics style, which seems refreshing at first, quickly becomes tiring- Music ranges from rather good to annoying- Unless I missed something, you can't get any information on your opponents, which is a hassle to prepare a good strategy when in combat- Small bugs, mainly due to the fact that after a reload, all doors (including those you opened with a key that then disappeared) are closed again- Some achievements are bugged (looks like I got rather lucky with them), and if you're after a perfect game, I think you'll have to play once at each difficulty (not sure, and 1 run was enough for me, I'm not gonna try again).Anyway, for the price, and despite these flaws, recommended if you like dungeon crawlers."

For 5$ its a steal, any rpg fan must try at this price even. Imagine playing a party based dragon warrior with some animations. It is a game i did not expect to put on top of my must play list, well played game.. well played. You also get a lot of customisation options in which minions to use during gameplay. Simple and effective, you dont need Crysis level graphics to make a game good, this is a prime example.Further Edit:Hmm i should also add that the game is a first person dungeon crawling rpg. You explore various dungeons not in a way unlike the old school game 'Moraff's Revenge'.The main appeals of the game are its atmosphere, its rpg setting, its choices of playable characters/minions and acessibility. By this i mean, it is cheap, nearly anyone with 5$ laying around can try it, and can you honestly name me a game where every ability of your character are a decent choice? I have used every ability of every character I've played with so far, at least once. May it be for CC, cheaper cost, conserve energy, or exploit an enemy vulnerability. All i can think off is how i just spam the same ability in almost every other rpg, i try not to, but often only a few choices are ressonable given the circumstances.Have a nice day!"

The traditional FPS dungeon crawl with turn based combat has been around a long time. Some of the greats (Dungeon Hack, Ultima series, Might & Magic, Eye of the Beholder) are perfect and definitely fundamental considering how long the style and some of the series lasted.Paper Sorceror is a proud addition to this long line of games.

You should probably stay away from it if you don't like its stylized graphics or if old-school dungeon crawlers make you feel scared, but if you played games like the Bard's Tale (not the newer action-RPG remake, I mean the original), or the Wizardry series on the NES, you'd feel at home with this game.

However, the programming team was either inexperienced or rushed in finishing this game.  The programming on this game is horrible.  While other areas, like artwork, look fairly well polished, there is a critical lack of basic polish on the code.  I've seen flash games with better polish.Let's start off with text prompts.  You see that screenshot showcasing the spell list, with the funky alignment issues?  That's a small taste of what I'm talking about.  Text is screwed up everywhere!  Much of the interfaces look like they paid some 16-year-old who barely speaks English to design it.  There are misspellings, case issues, text alignment issues, design flaws, and yes, bugs and glitches, which are well covered in other reviews.Trying to play this on a controller is fruitless.  Even when you map the keys, you'll find that the main button for doors and items is permanently bound to the left mouse button.  And sometimes it will crash in the middle of the binding menu.  Also, why are there two binding menus?  Seriously... there's one on the pre-start screen, and one in game.Equipment management can be a pain.  You can't revert to a previous character during the fight menu.  You can't see any stats from any of the enemies.  Enemies before a fight are just blobs on the screen, which is a bit of a cop out.  The hardest difficulty level is basically impossible without cheating.Yes, there's a good game struggling to come out, but the weight of the flaws wear you thin after a while."
,Recommended,263560,24768212,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,DonkeyWorld,"I got to about 1/3 of the way through Paper Sorcerer playing on hard, and I won't be finishing it. The regular battles have become a rather repetitive rotation of building up energy for abilities, tank taunting, healing, and damage. I don't vary my strategies much because there's not much of a need. After the first floor of the dungeon, you can full heal any living party members at any time by going back to town. It sort of takes away the need to optimize. You see, the resource management for multiple battles just isn't there in this game. There's not really much interesting individual character customization. Despite these flaws, I'm still going to recommend Paper Sorcerer.Why?The visuals are unique and a cool blend of retro/modern style. The music is fantastic. The classes are interesting and there are a bunch of viable party compositions. It's $5 for 10 hours of solid, if not spectactular dungeon crawling. For someone who has played a lot of strategy games and RPGs, hard difficulty felt perfect. I never felt the need to grind, but bosses always felt like the perfect challenge.  Ohh...the bosses in this game. They are tough and definitely reward strategy. If I could play just the boss fights then yeah, I would've finished the game. Not only are they diverse encounters, but they challenge you to radically change your tactics.So, Paper Sorcerer has got plenty enough positivies going for it that despite my being done with it early, it's a thumbs up from. Anyone intersted for a first person dungeon crawler will get at least multiple hours of enjoyment out of it."

But once you get past Block 2, your party and the enemies begin to develop new and more interesting skills that may take a little strategy to handle.  I love how your summons gain experience and level even if they're not in your ""active"" party, that way you can switch party members to suit your needs, or if you're having trouble completing an area.  SAVE OFTEN!  As far as I can tell, there is no auto-save.  Which is fine, it just takes a little getting used to after playing every game that has an auto-save function.  So far I love the story and the humor, such a great trip to the past to what games in the late 80's used to be like.  No crazy graphics (my crappy computer thanks you) and animations, while minimal, get the point across.  From what I have seen or read about this game online, I judge to be about halfway through the game, and all I can think about is finishing it!If I had to pick one thing I like most about Paper Sorcerer, it would be the replay value.  I'm already planning my next summons for after I complete this playthrough!And for everyone complaining about the visuals:  This game is supposed to be a sendback to the RPG games of the 1980's, the era that this genre came to life through computers and consoles.  Before games like this one were made in the 80's, you had to read a book to experience the Fantasy genre.  The fact that this game, and the creators from Ultra Runaway Games, decided to pay homage to that industry-changing decade, makes me love it even more!  Plus, it's called PAPER Sorcerer.  Not just because it includes aspects from a paper-based RPG game... It looks like crinckled paper!Sorry if that's offensive to you people who don't like the way it looks.Anyways, highly recommended!"
,Recommended,263560,23949780,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,PizzaSHARK!,"I bought this game primarily for the aesthetics but found there was a pretty decent amount of actual gameplay there, too.  Fans of games like Ultima Underworld and Legend of Grimrock will probably feel right at home, though combat is strictly turn-based and takes place on a separate screen.  In that sense, fans of turn-based RPG combat may also enjoy it.While the game lasted a surprising 13 or so hours for me, I'll freely admit the last half or so of that was just fairly mindless repetition.  I think the game would be greatly improved if they'd just condensed the experience into four or five blocks of four floors each, rather than nine blocks plus an additional nine optional areas.  Past a certain point, I wasn't even exploring anymore - just trying to beeline for the stairs to the next floor, avoiding combat whenever possible.The game also has some pretty substantial balance issues - bosses are almost never a challenge (the first couple bosses are challenging because of how limited your arsenal is, but by time you reach the third or fourth boss, they cease to be a serious threat), and some monsters and groups of monsters are hilariously overpowered.  Some of your characters can become equally overpowered, and it's really just based on getting to a certain level with them.  Skill advancement is predetermined and automatic, and it feels like it could've used a little more attention there, too - especially late in the game, characters will have something insane like 20 or more skills you have to scroll through to use the four or five that are actually worth using while the rest are just mindless clutter.I'd also say the game isn't as ""tactical"" as the blurbs claim it is.  I never once had to change out my party members for others (despite the fact that you can do so freely and even make use of the skills of party members not currently active, like having a healer patch everyone up between fights), nor did I ever really have to vary my tactics in battle.  The tank tanked, the berserker hit their entire party for a billion damage, the healer healed, and the sorcerer hit their entire party for only a million damage but applied ridiculously strong damage over time effects.  Sometimes I'd use the healer to put someone to sleep or blind them, but that's about it.The only time I actually hit a roadblock was a particular unavoidable fight in the last block of floors, and it was harder than literally every single boss fight in the game, including the fights at the very end where you have to fight sets of former bosses together (unfortunately these bosses are no stronger than when you originally fought them, so you're so much stronger than them at that point it's a little embarrassing how quickly they die.)  The problem was that the difficulty of this one battle hinged ENTIRELY on random chance.  Two of the four enemies in it possess EXTREMELY powerful attacks that hit your entire party - if they use them, you lose.  If they don't use them, you win.  It took me something like 11 tries before the RNG played things my way, and I didn't feel like I won through skill so much as luck.  Putting one to sleep still allows the other one to effectively one-shot your entire party, and the sleep skill itself has a chance to fail and has a cooldown before you can try again.But all this is kind of picking at nits.  For $5 it's a hell of a deal, and in all honesty - don't feel like you NEED to beat the game.  The ending gives you some cute, amusing little epilogues about your party members and wraps up a sub-plot that you may or may not have even been aware of, depending on how aggressively you search every nook and cranny to read random things."

The game features difficult turn-based combat which serves as blarney for the grognards and a hit off the nostalgia bong for the rest of us. These two experiences juxtaposed to each other are quite disjointed, but in the end it’s a game criminally under-priced. You should really give this game a try."

I had to restart the game a number of times after having got stuck in a menu and the buttons stop working.There is very little strategy and very little difference between characters. Skills are mostly unimpressive and while the monster variety is impressive, there isnt much a difference between each mob outside of the boss of each level. The only mechanic that has any bearing outside of combat is the thief lockpick skills but outside of the first lock you run into, HE CAN NEVER PICK THE LOCKS. I get they wanted to have their stupid key puzzles but why make that mechanic if picking him doesnt give you any advantage?The story is wholy not interesting. Its one of those lets set up the basics at the very start, mention nothing else about the story untill the very last 10 minutes of the game, and then dump everything at the end. None of the characters are memorable in any way, and the game has this weird back and forth between being serious and being funny.... Or at least trying to be funny.If this game had spent longer time in development it may have become fantastic, but as it stands I can only say get it on sale if you are a die hard fan of these types of games."

Not because its glitchy, but because the balancing is all off.  Some skills are basically useless (which happens in alot of rpgs), so your often limited to two or three viable skills per class.  Too many skills either are WAY underpowered, or simply don't give you the status effect they say they will.

The first-person dungeon crawling is pretty much everything you've come to expect from these kinds of games, but the combat demands strategic use of all your party members' abilities and strengths. In fact, combat is really the best part of Paper Sorcerer. It may take the same amount of time to clear some normal packs of trash mobs in this game as it would to take on a boss from any other RPG, but the battles themselves are worth it and are infrequent and varied enough to keep from becoming too repetitive.Unfortunately, my recommendation of this game comes with some SEVERE hesitation. The entire user interface is an uncategorized, unformatted, and at times non-functioning mess. Thankfully the menu bugginess is mostly limited to non-combat situations, but it's still a major pain to work with such an aggressively bad UI. There are also a number of bugs that can occur while exploring the dungeon that may require a restart of the game, which will also re-close any doors you've opened making it harder to re-orient yourself afterward. There's either some slight inexperience going on here or the game needed to get booted out the door to satisfy Kickstarter backers.If you want some engaging as hell combat and party customization and don't mind wading through some annoying bugs and terrible menus, by all means have a go at Paper Sorcerer."

Especially early game where your health depletes so fast without defense.From the description, it emphasize on tactics over grinding, this is true at least on the first block. But for the next blocks actually I still need to grind, especially when I play harder difficulties. What gets on my nerve is that the game feels so slow. Grinding takes very much of my time. Not because I need to kill that many enemies, but killing one enemy takes very long time.After grinding, even bosses are very easy to kill. too easy perhaps.

,Recommended,263560,8923014,"Posted: 31 January, 2014",all,Rhavviepoodle,"Paper Sorcerer is a turn-based RPG and dungeon crawler with a stylistic flair. First off, there's a somewhat monochromatic theme throughout the game, alongside heavy contrast thanks to fairly common shadows. Thus when colors do appear, they're much more striking. While the sprites and animation themselves aren't the best, the total effect of the game was a minimalistic experience which I found rather refreshing. The developers are still sorting out a few kinks with the game, such as being able to adjust game volume and the like. That wasn't a problem for me, as I found the soundtrack helped set the mood of the game and all told was a fan of it.As for the gameplay, you are a sorcerer bound in a magic tome, with the objective of fighting your way out. Your party consists of minions whom you summon with your arcane powers. Some of this game's stylistic charm comes from the fact that instead of the cut-and-dry mage/fighter/thief, your minions are themselves monsters: minotaurs, vampires, ghosts, imps, and the like. This comes off across a lot less as anti-heroes as you'd think it would, but it was another thing I found quite refreshing about this game.The combat itself is quite fun and has depth, while managing to keep things simple enough. One of my qualms with the normal difficulty setting was that after a point, the combat was a bit too easy, though there are harder difficulties to fix that problem. A good deal of the gameplay comes from exploring dungeons and finding secrets. These can range from easy to very puzzling, with the harder ones being more rewarding to complete. This aspect of the gameplay fits in very well with the rest, the result being an excellent dungeon delving experience.So I can't tell you this game is perfect, but I don't really think it tries to be. When I first saw this game, I got ""art game"" vibes from it, but actually playing it, Paper Sorcerer comes off much less pretenious than that. The final product here is a laid-back (if somewhat minimalistic) dungeon crawl. It has breadth without being overly complicated, and most importantly it was refreshing. For five dollars, this is definitely worth picking up: if you're a fan of turn-based RPGs, Paper Sorcerer is a solid game that you can sink both your teeth and your time into."

Hard to read font.Annoyance: between each line of dialog, the dialog window disappears and reappears.  That's useless, slow, and since the game is black and white it creates a disturbing flash.  Imagine someone flickering the light after each sentence.Usability: start the game in 1600x900 and look how the ""Controls"" button is covered by the others.  Admire how the mouse cursor lags behind...  the other mouse cursor? (yes, there are two).  You cannot use the keyboard to navigate menus because there is an artificial delay of half a second after each keypress so you have to press, wait, press, wait, press, wait, validate in order to select the third item from a list.  Speaking of validation: space, enter, numpad enter, click, doube-click, it's a mess.  The ""Back"" button acts sometimes as ""OK"", sometimes as ""Cancel"".  Fitts's law was totally ignored during the design, forcing you to swing your mouse all over in order to navigate the windows and menus.Making UIs is hard, I know, there are entire books and university degrees about it, but when a game relies so heavily on it, one would expect basic errors to be avoided.

The team making this game is obviously on a budget, and you can see some oddball errors (like inky shadows that are actually 2d planes you can see behind if you jump into the corner) but they decided to use their limited resources to make the most visually striking game they could, regardless.The same can be said of combat, which is the real meat of the game.  The game uses pre-generated character archetypes that you add to your party in a team of your choosing.  The array of choices are unfortunately not overwhelming, and you don't get a very clear sense of who can do what until after you get them in your party, but if you save before the choice, and experiment a little, you can figure things out.Combat revolves around energy (which is used only 1-6 points at a time, and where you recover 1 per turn) and cooldowns on skills, as well as an unusual defense system.  Defense drops after physical attacks, and applies to both physical and magic attacks.  Since very high defense nullifies direct magic damage, you need to pound a target's armor down to make them vulnerable to magic.  Meanwhile, magic skills that debuff resistance to physical damage or can incapacitate a target are available, but only within the limits of energy and cooldowns.  It's a game that has unusual depth to how much you have to think to get through even regular battles. (Especially on the brutal ""1980s"" difficulty.)Unfortunately, the game also behaves oddly in many circumstances.  Ability cooldowns don't take as long as they say they do in the menu, and sometimes last into the next combat you engage in.  If you move the mouse while the 2d image of the town is loading, you actually make the perspective on the town move, as it's just a 2d cutout in front of the game's camera.  There's an achievement that you can't unlock because it was accidentally made inaccesible.There's also some balance issues, especially with overpowered skills like sleep, where enemies  only wake up from normal attacks, while a skeleton that's using physical skills to kill the opponent never wakes the target.  This tends to make status effect and damage-over-time characters extremely powerful, while the characters that rely upon direct magic damage are extremely weak because of the way defense works against them."

A cross between Shadowgate, Pokemon and Final Fantasy is how I described it to friends.The art style is fantastic and really helps set the game apart from the mountains of voxel games flooding Steam currently. Music is non-intrusive, and lends itself well to the atmosphere, especially during battle.The newest update helps the game, especially with sorting the inventory.I think having more explanations about the status effects (and how to remove them, I remember wasting so many potions trying to remove different things to no avail), and a way of displaying enemy health/def bars would improve the game even further.Definitely recommended."

Probably will pick up again when the developer makes a few updates. You play as an inprisoned (inside a magical book) sorcerer able to summon 3 party memebers (thralls) to help you on your quest to escape.The combat speed can be a little slow but I didn't mind. The variability of the thralls you choose to aid you is what I feel makes this game great. 3 healers, 2 (main) tanks, and several dps and buff/debuff characters to round it out keeps replayability high.I had a good romp with my team: Vampire (dps/heals), Skeleton (tank), Ghost (buff/debuff), on my playthough. I feel this game is about taking out or incapacitating your enemies before they take out you VS. a give and take of damage with a balanced party with a tank and healer. My opinion could change on a higher difficulty playthrough or if the developer changes the balance of the game.Combat remained fresh, really satisfied that RPG itch I didn't know I was craving. You constantly feel your team growing stronger through levels and new loot which is great.I also appreciated the visual style and music - different and maybe repetitive but I was sold on what the developer was conveying the moment I started the game.Like I said, a little game updating is necessary (some translations, which would make the ending more understandable / maaaybe a combat speed modifier / savable video and control layouts) but the developer seems to be on top of the community requests. Recommendation: Definitely Play - best 5 bucks I've spent in a long time."

For me, though, it is the storytelling and the quirky sense of humour that shames other games that are ten times its asking price.

,Recommended,263560,22525070,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,orpe11,"TL;DR: A first-person dungeon crawler with minimal story and some galling bugs, saved by a very fun combat system.This is one of those reviews where I am rather conflicted about the recommendation. On one hand, Paper Sorcerer is one of the few games that I started playing, and I was compelled to keep going until I finished. No breaks, no stopping, I started and played it every evening until I finished it. On the other hand, it is a flawed game in some unacceptable ways, and I can understand other people not wanting to deal with the issues.Paper Sorcerer is a first person dungeon crawler. It is entirely that, meaning that once you start the game, you will be walking down corridors, opening doors, fighting enemies, finding treasure, etc. You do this for the entire game, except for occasional forrays into the hub town where you can buy things and rest. There is a story, and a reason why it looks monochrome-ish (You are in a book, hence the name), but it is entirely minimal, and it is actually a bit jarring at the end when the game suddenly seems to act like you care about the people you talked to. The cast is entirely limited to one friendly NPC who guides you through, a few shop NPCs, and the bosses you kill along the way. There are some further bits of story that you find in notes in rooms, but they are easily missable, and not very compelling. So if you want a compelling, interesting story...not really for you.Paper Sorcerer also has bugs. A lot of bugs. While the game does free itself from the adherence to grid-based movement other first person dungeon crawlers have, the designer didn't seem able to code some of it quite right. You will walk into a room, and the game will freeze for a moment, likely calculating some event, before letting you continue that otherwise smooth walk. This is most noticeable in your bedroom, where after initially looting it, you will most likely just walk to the bed, rest, and then walk out. This is hampered by every single time, the game hangs on something halfway to the bed, a second or two pause that will yank you out of the smooth movement every time. An actually major bug is that the game will forget doors are open upon loading. This includes doors locked with keys. So if you unlock a door, don't get everything inside, step back out, and save/load, you can't get back in. The most galling is the fact that the last puzzle in the game (upon which you have been gathering chess pieces for, working up to, etc), doesn't work. You get to the room, you have everything, and the doors just won't let you interact with them, denying you the last reward. Several achievements are bugged as well, not working on finishing the game (The book achievements) or puzzles (The last two or so puzzles),So why is this still a recommendation? The designer has managed to make the combat in this game extremely fun. At the start, you just have the sorcerer, but soon you start acquiring party members by summoning old minions. Of a rather major note, all of the minions fall into 'DPS, Tank, Healer' sort of categories, but their actual play styles are quite different. In example, while the Vampire is noted as a Healer, he heals through draining life, using his own to cast major heals...and is also a fairly powerful DPS in his own right with his physical attacks. The large varieties of useful parties helps replayability if you enjoy the combat system...and I certainly did. The system eschews normal MP styles, instead using energy. Every character recovers 1 energy per turn, and most skills only use a few. After a few levels, every class gets a skill that lets you recover energy and gain a buff (For example, the Vampire recovers energy and buffs his magic for a few turns). All skills have a cool down, forcing you to use a wide variety instead of just spamming the same skills. This gives battle a bit of a rhythm, and lets you choose between low cost energy skills for rapid fire attacks, or holding back to unleash larger ones, and both have their place in different fights. Later on, your characters get more options, and have quite a massive list of skills, but all of them are usable in combat without completely overwriting others (older skills rank up as well as you go). In addition, instead of a straight 'defense reduces damage' system, your characters defense is a seperate HP bar. It is reduced when hit, sometimes leaking HP damage through, but a lot of the time if your defense is large enough, completely blocking an attack and just taking a defense hit. This plus the energy system allows for a rather varied combat game, as you use different skills for high or low defense enemies, and you have a bit of a barrier to losing HP to random encounters. As such, you can actually dungeon crawl for a while before having to rest and recover, and the battles always have a rythm to them. The lack of actual random encounters in all but a few areas means that you never get bogged down in the game.So at the end of the day, it is a good game, but it is hampered by bugs and some annoyances. The designer still seems to be working on fixing them, but their existance is inexcusable in an otherwise well designed game. Pick it up if you like well designed combat systems, don't if bugs drive you up a wall or you need a good story."

I thought I'd write up a review of it.Pros:* Old-school dungeon-crawl feel.* Nice art.* Neat little storyline.* Turn-based combat, which makes strategy easier.* Quite a bit of potential with skill training. Casters don't have to stay quite so ""squishy,"" which has helped me in boss fights.Cons:* Combat can be a little repetitive.* Minotaur minion seems a bit overpowered at the beginning, but he seems to balance out and be on par with other characters by around level 11.* Slight issue with the save function--it doesn't automatically update and show me my new save. I have to hit ""back,"" and it shows me the new save for exactly one second, so it's hard to confirm if I've saved the game unless I watch it like a hawk.Additional: This is not a complex game. Some people might see that as a negative thing, but in this case, simple is better. The precept of getting out of the dungeon is straightforward. I have a few slight complaints, namely that I would dearly like to see some sort of enemy status bar so I know what debuffs I have put on them, but ultimately, if you're looking for an old rpg dungeon crawl game, for $5, this one isn't too shabby, not too shabby at all.

One of the most satisfying endings I've seen in quite a while, in fact! Took about a week to beat(easy difficulty), so there was a good bit of substance, although very repetitive..I liked the game decently enough that I might give it another swing at a higher difficulty later on, if/when I have more free time. It's a well-balanced(the highlight of the game, IMO) title, and not overly complex, but it needs a LOT of work to catch up to the likes of Dragon Warrior and/or Legend of Grimrock. :)PROS:- A simple, fun, balanced little RPG to jump into if you're short on time.- Unique graphic/art style.- Not overly complex!CONS:- It's a bit buggy... Save often. You may run into some seriously buggy bugs. Fairly poor build quaility.- The level/world design is simplistic, and very repetitive.- I was not very impressed by the music, but sound FX were decent.- Unless you memorize all the spell effect icons, it's difficult to keep up with all the spells in effect during battles. I wish there was an information box available to tell...- No solo mode :(FINAL SCORE: 6-6.5/10"

I always loved high difficulty in rpgs, but I also loved the ability to grind for the absolute best gear and higher levels.

For the majority of the game the environments are the same, however this seemed to be much more of a design choice rather than a lack of innovation. The story is cleverly told with some elements humour that is both witty and well placed.The most stark flaw of this title is a bug on one of the final floors that blocks entry into a secret that had a considerable amount of multi-floor puzzle solving build up, that is yet to be patched. The party system does have a considerable amount of customizability, allowing the player to choose their followers, ranging from cultists to axe wielding minotaurs. There is enough loot in this game to sate the desire of any kleptomaniac as well as a shop with an unending supply of gems to your hoards to. The skill trainer introduces a degree of customizability in terms of combat traits to your followers outside of weaponry and armour but aside from this the role that each member will fill is predetermined. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Paper Sorcerer, on normal it is a good 13-15 hour experience, perhaps more on higher difficulties, however the bug on the higher levels (while not progression blocking in the story, blocks access to loot) certainly tarnishes its appeal; despite this the gameplay is fantastic and the story is well crafted possessing interesting plot points.

Love the stylized paper look, the whole premise of being trapped in a book, and the spread of characters to choose from. So many different combinations of party! Not just your typical Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard dungeon-spelunking team.My first playthrough has the Sorcerer with a Vampire, Troll and Skeleton. It's an interesting challenge playing without a dedicated healer (Vampire can heal, but it's not his primary function), and I still haven't figured out the Troll's full potential (he's rogue-ish but still falls far behind damage-wise compared to my other characters. I have a feeling crits will be more critty as I go on.) The Skeleton, though, is a tank powerhouse, so I've been using his abilities to build / regain defense to stay alive. It's worked... So far.Dungeon crawlers are supposed to be hard, and this is definitely a challenging game, but less so than playing, say, Etrian Odyssey or Ancient Domains of Mystery. I actually feel like I have a chance of beating this game the first time through without getting bored from all the grinding halfway through. Of course, I've not even gotten past the second level yet, so my evaluation can change, but so far? Just difficult enough.The only negatives I'd like to point out are some UI glitches (nothing game breaking though) and the fact that when you save, the save window doesn't update with your new save info.

Not too tough but not frustrating or required to complete them to advance.Party variety is very unique but you cannot use all minions on a single play through.

The art style is exactly what it needs to be: simple, yet engaging. The combat is simplified but is reminiscent of just about all turn-based RPGs with a nice assortment of skills that doesn't get overwhelming. The music is appropriate for its setting and after a few turns of combat, I barely notice that it's there because it becomes ambient-I like that. It fills a void that other games just don't satisfy for me.It can feel grindy to some, the combat can get particularly repetitive especially if turn-based combat isn't your thing. This is  what I would definitely consider a ""casual"" game, you're not going to find a lot of flashy environments, that said, however; at least it doesn't tax lower-end computers like mine. I can play it on the ""fantastic"" setting for graphics and there's no issue. There is really no options menu to speak of, you get a choice of three resolutions, the option of being in windowed or non-windowed mode, and the option to change the level of graphics. You can rebind controls as you will, and the game does offer information on it's in-game menu if you need some help deciding on which thralls to summon.It doesn't exert any tactical thought, but that's part of its charm to me. It's a game I can just load up, sink an hour or two into, feel nostalgic, and then be satisfied. It never feels like ""work"" to me, but as mentioned, it can become grindy to anyone unfamiliar with the basic repetition of turn-based random encounters. All in all, a pleasant experience."

However the story while lihgtly touched out through out is a bit different than the usual reason of being thrown in a dungeon as well as how you form your party to fight your way out.As someone who favors turn based combat for rpg titles this was certainly up my alley. However at times the controls for moving around the menues can make sorting out items and shuffling to stronger things troublesome at times. Yet this doesn't take away the enjoyment of lurking around every inch of floor just to find one last bit of treasure if not a whole secret room.Saving is your friend however try to keep some notes around as it doesn't really help you out understanding what you last did if you decide to take a long break from the game.

The difficulty seems pretty simple at 'normal', but if you want a challenge play on hard/1980's.Some of the fights are slow, the loot is randomized (one playthrough gave me piles of epic rogue gear for my goblin, next time (game does need an autosave... but alas the game is meant to feel like 1989) I got a ton of warrior gear for my skelly.You will find that the bosses are quite a bit harder than the other monsters on the same levels, but otherwise the game is pretty straight forward. Secrets aren't too hard to find, so you don't have to spend weeks or months trying to figure out that crap. No puzzles like the old Eye of the Beholders series really, as far as I've found thus far. Gameplay is a blast though, but some battles as stated already do take forever due to a mix of status effects or healers on the AI's side.So bring a good drink or two, some food, and settle in for a very strong game set in the glory days of western RPGs."

These will force you to take every battle strategically and often leave you surviving by the skin of your teeth."

While the game suffers from a staggering lack of information about your possible minions, and while it's mostly monochromatic, I can look past those gripes to enjoy a fantastic, Wizardry-like party based experience.For a possible sequel, I'd love to see more characters (at least 6) in a group at once, maybe some colored ""illustrations"", or, well, colored *anything*."
