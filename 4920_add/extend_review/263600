I then downloaded the extra tools that you needed to use the engine to its full potential and almost all of them were fully in Japanese.  This made me unable to use the software for anything because I do not speak Japanese and all of the important tools were in Japanese.  The engine/game also runs very poorly and I never got over 15 fps in it.  Both of these problems caused me to refund the engine.  I believe that if the developers took the time to fix these two problems and streamlined the game creation system this would be a really good fighting game engine.  I was originally really excited when I bought this, but left disappointed."

If not then--good luck because the developers will not respond to the most basic questions I have placed in the discussions forum.I went through the manual. Installed everything requried. Learned How to Use SoftImage well enough. While I am glad I took time to look at Soft Image. It does not mean that I could use it for EF-12 because of the manual being so poorely constructed.--the images are still in japanese--tutorials are fine but could be better. A PDF file containing all of them and  not just a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of assorted files would be appropriate and standard.Im gunna give this a Never BUY.
,Not Recommended,263600,31627920,Posted: 8 May,all,fishface_8910,This game is hard to use.Its more a fighting game that let's you import models (like modding minecraft) rather than letting you make your own game (like RPG maker).It also has it's own format for models so you can't just paste a .3ds file or whatever and then said file is in the game.

,Recommended,263600,29683255,Posted: 3 February,all,Arala Cran,"""Great potential, Bad lag.""Imagine this: are you familiar with Mugen? Have you wanted to make a fighting game like it but in 3D? Still a bit familiar with Enterbrain's Fighter Maker programs but want to step it up? ......what if such possibilities of Mugen was added with Fighter Maker's more up-to-date style of 3D...? well EF-12 has just the answer to that dream to be true!This system engine is almost as good as Mugen. One can create characters and stages, also maybe even their very own HUD system for EF-12. There isn't much but the catch is because it's newer and it also holds one large difference: this goes 3D! There is one huge problem however: having been a far more powerful system than some others and outputting better quallity that most others, this system.... has quite a laggy issue.... and even on a somewhat good Laptop, so beware of this..."

76561198298958442,Recommended,263600,33417682,Posted: 9 July,all,rubyjemearth,"I will say that you need an up to date, high end pc in order to run this proper.For all those who complain about lag, it's because you need better gear.The engine is powerful and all, but you need to learn to use the manual from steam,and download it onto your pc.you will also need to download other software in order to create moves.it's a bit of a learning curve, but once you get around it, you should be in the clear.You will also need to use Blender if you don't have the money for high end 3d software.in my opinion, this is a amazing program for those who know how to use it for what it's capable of."
