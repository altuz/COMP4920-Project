,Recommended,263680,8542159,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,Maxey,This is the worst game I've ever played and I highly recommend it. It's up there with Ride to Hell Retribution in terms of hilarious incompetence and misery. It's one of those unique experiences that are so bad that you just have to see it for yourself.You owe it to yourself to suffer and laugh through this game.

My friend and I discovered after playing through the whole game that what we have here is clearly the better experience. For example:Uncharted had Nolan North.Unearthed has Troy Baker.Which one of these voice actors won GOTY last year? That's what I thought.Unearthed: 1 Uncharted: 0Unearthed runs at 60 FPS at 1080p. Uncharted only runs at 720p at 30 FPS. Basic math tells us that since the frame buffer has roughly 4 times as many pixels and twice as many frames, Unearthed is at least 8 times better looking than Uncharted.Unearthed: 9 Uncharted: 0Uncharted 3 had horses. Unearthed has 4 wheel ATVs. That's 4 more wheels than Uncharted lets you ride.Unearthed: 13 Uncharted: 0Uncharted only runs on the PS3, while Unearthed runs on Android, PC, Mac, and probably the Gizmondo.Unearthed: 17 Uncharted: 0Uncharted only has creepy slippery Nazis. Unearthed has full on zombies, and it doesn't need to explain why they're there.Unearthed: 18 Uncharted: 0Uncharted usually only gives you a few weapons to choose from at any time. Unearthed has more weapon types than there are enemies in the entire campaign.Unearthed: 19 Uncharted: 0Nathan Drake is a ♥♥♥♥♥ who gets scared and emotional when the going gets tough. Faris Jawad doesn't stop cracking jokes even when a gun is fired at his sister.Unearthed: 20 Uncharted: 0Finally, as Unearthed rightfully points out on the store page, this game has been translated into more languages than most best-selling literature will ever see, because Semaphore knows everyone will want to play this and wants to be culturally sensitive to everyone. Uncharted consists of playing a white guy shooting minorities. I think we know who is more socially responsible.Unearthed: 41 Uncharted: RacismWinner: UnearthedThis is just a summary of all the things that make Unearthed the best. I didn't even go into detail about the leisurely strolls through the city discussing the plot, or the Kafka-esque analysis of the futility of escaping in a car as the city loops around you. There's just too much to this game to pack in one review, and I implore you to check out what may already be the de-facto GOTY of 2014."
,Not Recommended,263680,8547633,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,Onatam,"UPDATE: Here is a full play through for the game done by me. I went through it a second time for you guys.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDaqY5XSwlAFirst and foremost I would like to say that their are a lot of people bashing it just based on what they read from Metacritic, without actually owning or purchasing the game. I have in fact purchased and played through the entire game already. In short I can't recommend it as it is the shortest story driven game I have ever played (1 hour to complete going slowly). Here are my basic points and review of the game.The pros:- The story, while your two main characters are a bit weird (brother and sister), has some potential. Sort of Indiana Jones'ish.- The environment looks pretty decent for a $5 title. Recently Indie games have been scaling back the graphics to focus on gameplay, this actually has some pretty decent looking areas.- It is fully voiced in English and Arabic.The cons:- Short! The game is super short. It took me about a hour or so to complete and I could have done it a lot faster. 1 tutorial level, 1 full exploration level, 1 short vehicle combat level, 1 walk around level, 1 quick chase event, and 1 driving event.- Weird movement issues at points. I would try to interact with a ladder to go down and it would jump me in the air and climb up something that wasn't there.- AI is dumb. I would shoot someone with a SMG and their buddy a couple feet away would still be walking patrol saying something like ""I know he's around somewhere"". Also some other nuances like ""Cover me, I'm reloading"" when no shots were fired.- The melee combat is awful.- The driving sequence has you driving around Moroco, but the city just loops around. You will drive through the same streets no matter how you progress.Would I recommend it? Not really. The game has some glaring issues with it, in many cases to the point of them being comical. However I am curious what they are going to do with the next few episodes. I don't regret the purchase if for anything will make for a good playthrough video. It is a $5 USD game for let's say 1 hour of campaign. There is a survival mode that I unlocked after completing it, but I could take or leave that. The price point is so low that you might want to pick it up just to see what it's about, but you aren't going to miss anything groundbreaking if you don't. Plus it is probably the shortest campaign driven story game that I have ever played."

Even in one of the early cutscenes it's mentioned that the protagonist ""always enjoyed raiding tombs and uncharting mysteries in videogames."" If the game wasn't so broken I may have enjoyed it, but it makes Deadfall Adventures look like ""the Citizen Kane of Video Games"". It's sad because the Unity engine is capable of much, much more.Would only recommend it if you want something to laugh at."

Moving is a hassle, left/right movement is not strafing but will turn the character, move him forwards and re-align the camera - no matter what the mouse tells the camera to do. Might be handy on a console, but when you're using a mouse to control the camera view - why build in things that override the player controls? It's really an utter nuisance. Controls can't even be configured. Maybe you'll find it better with a gamepad, but even with a controller there's nothing you could do to avoid ""jump-rolling"" into a wall and dropping into eternity. Doesn't look toooo bad, it's obvious that some work went into this, but to my eyes it's PS2 level, hardly PS3. Not ""current shooter average"".Pigeons sitting under water, enemies staring at walls and shouting lame ""reloading, cover me"" commands into an empty room, showing zero AI at all...

,Not Recommended,263680,8548393,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,Ezio,"The game has potential. It’s pretty, and the story is assassin’s creed like.The biggest problem with this game I thought was the controls. I just never felt that its fluid enough in both keyboard and Xbox controller. I give it 5/10The developer also jammed every game style they could in the game. You have tomb exploration, driving, FPS, chasing bad guys on rooftops, melee fighting, and shooting from moving vehicles. It felt like each scene was from a different game genre. There's even a Zombie survival mode you can unlock that has nothing to do with the game!!!There are game extras that are tied to finishing the game in different difficulty. I barely got myself to finish it once, and had no intentions of replaying it just for extras eventhough I liked the unclocked extras. Over ambitious for a first release.Technical glitches got to me like the room with randomly dropping boulders. One got stuck and a whole bunch of boulders started pooling behind the stuck rock. It’s never a good idea to leave levels like this to pure physics engine, there has to be a sequence. The car driving scene in morocco, the car was all over the place and got stuck on a post. The roads were too empty and didn’t feel like there’s a purpose for driving even when got surrounded by three police cars I was still able to drive on and push one out of my way.I wished they’d focus on the controls this way we could enjoy the game and appreciate the levels.Every time I saw the loading screen I wished it would say “to be continued” and end because I did not enjoy the controls, but at the same time I wanted to see what will happen next because I’m curious.I like the localization and having both English and Arabic spoken. The English voice acting was better than the Arabic.I hope they get the controls fixed for episode 2"

I can't wait until he tears it a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because he's a cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that's what cynical people do!""If this was your reaction when you noticed this review, then I'm sorry to tell you that I will not write a funny 9/11 Allahu Akbar type of review. I respect the dev team, who put a lot of work and effort in this game, too much for that. Well yeah, this game is inspired by Uncharted, Tomb Raider, what not, they won't deny that. But at least they are enthusiastic about it. What's the last time you saw people this happy about making a game? Even if the game is buggy (and oh, trust me, it is, I'll elaborate) I still had fun playing it simply because I know the devs had fun making it. They really want to make an amazing adventure series where you explore the arabic world and its many fascinating places (which it truly has, no doubt about that). The dev team knows that they're not making GOTYAY material and doesn't say they are. They try to stay positive while everyone on the internet's too busy making fun of them and their ""worst game ever"" (a title that many other games I've played deserve more). They respond nicely to often assholish or 'funny' behaviour and criticism, which I think is something most developers can learn from. So yeah, kuddos for that, guys.Now for the game itself. I'll give you a quick rundown of what I enjoyed and what I thought could use improvement.Good:The world: as mentioned earlier, the arabic world and culture and its interesting treasures is often overlooked because 'muh terrorism'. A shame, really, since some of the world's most amazing buildings and sculptures were made by arabians..The characters: I appreciate the duo being brother and sister instead of a shoe-horned love interest. While it felt a little awkward sometimes, there's still some awws and ohs to be had when Faris and Dania talk about Dania's obesity problem and how her choice of tea could help her.Music and sound:  music was pretty solid, I like the ""old man singing"" that's often found in arabic music and this game had plenty of it. Voice acting was decent and so was the sound design, although some guns sound a little weak.Story: the campaign has an interesting premise and it's nice to know that the main character and his female sidekick won't end up banging each other by the end of the game (right Semaphore? RIGHT?)Survival: I really liked the survival mode. I didn't expect there to be zombies or mummies, but I sure enjoyed killing them, although it's a little buggy, sometimes, and it'd be nice if weapons/power ups would disappear after a while so the floor doesn't look like the surface of a giant disco ball.Bad:Controls: while they are much better than on the console version, there's still much left to be desired. It's also a bit of a shame that you can't map any buttons yourself for the keyboard controls.Bugs: there are still a lot of bugs in this game. Both in graphic (the background in the desert chase level would have really weird chancing colours and stuff, weird shadows or character models that stretch out to disturbing levels) and sound (the MP5's firing sound would sometimes disappear in long burst fire, lines of dialogue that aren't heard, random bits of sound that disappear, etc).Combat in general: the boxing/CQC feels kind of awkward and stiff and gunfights are way too easy thanks to dumb AI and insanely accurate weapons with little recoil (AK2stronk). The 'stealth' in the tomb wasn't anything special either, but it did the job, I suppose. My major complaint is that all guns kind of feel the same. Sure, you have your pistols (which kind of feel the same) and the shotgun, but besides that, the three rifles (G36C, M16 variant and AK) and submachineguns (MAC 1, Mini Uzi and MP5) all kind of feel the same. Try to give them more damage, accuracy or recoil in order to give them ""their own feel"" so each rifle suits a different kind of player.Length: I completed the campaign on hard in one hour and a few minutes. Besides finding the few collectibles and the survival mode, there isn't a lot of gameplay left. Still, I only paid 70 cents for this game and I think that to be a more than fair price.And of course, the fact that the game still doesn't have its own face yet and feels like the arabic attempt at Uncharted. I'm sure the dev team will have a better idea of what direction to persue as time passes by, though.So yeah, in the end, I can't really recommend this game for its quality alone. If you can get it for 2 EUR or cheaper, though, then give it a try and have some fun with the campaign, silly bugs and survival mode. I wish Semaphore all the best and hope that they can make Unearthed a solid and fun gaming series."

The whole 'episode 1' feels like a prologue as its likely supposed too but inevitably it all feels a little like the devs got too ambitious. Its got tomb raiding, cover mechanics, RC cars, platforming, rooftop chases, car chases, a slightly awkward fighting system and a Sci-fi original narrative to boot.Its got jenky animations in all the right places, just watch their hands during the cut-scenes. The shooting is AT BEST functional. Its hard how to put into words why exactly it is I like this game and want to see more (though that's likely not going to happen) Its kind of like a bad movie in the way 'The Room” was; it sort of has this vibe as this is obviously a disaster but I can't look away and simply must see this thru.I am not making a comparison to Dreamfall: The Longest Journey as they are completely different games but I can't help but shake the feeling that this game reminded me of Dreamfall in a way that I'm not entirely sure I can justify. Yet the feeling remains.Some of the dialogue seems hyper aware that it's a videogame which is always fantastic to see. It has also come to my attention that this is some approximation of an iOS version which would explain why there is an option to automate aiming entirely right after choosing new game. Which would explain a lot of the overall jenkiness. But part of that jenkiness is what makes it endearing.THE GISTPick it up when its cheap.

Because if it doesn't make you cry first, ""Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta - Episode 1"" should make you laugh... perhaps even both. It's a game that tries to incorporate many elements from many games: shooting, platforming, roaming, puzzle-solving, driving, stealth, car chases, fighting... and more or less fails at each and every one.Note the ""Episode 1"" in the title. This game, as it is, features about an hour of gameplay, give or take 15 minutes. My playtime according to Steam is 72 minutes, and that was playing on Hard. Also note that about a quarter of that time was spent on cutscenes, so very little of actual gameplay remains...Either way, in this short hour ""Unearthed"" will treat you to:- a tutorial level where you will get accustomed with clunky non-rebindable controls, stiff character animations, the game's rudimentary cover-based shooting gameplay, messy hand-to-hand combat events, dodgy voice-acting at best, and finally - the beginnings of an almost non-exstant story which can be summarized as: you search for items other people want, too. Both of which are, by the way, for no apparent reason;- an actual ""Tomb Raider"" like level where you go and explore ancient ruins. Only there are no puzzles, no actual platforming or roaming of any kind. You just kinda go from the start to the finish. Once you get to the finish, you have to get back to the start, only this time the bad guys will shoot at you;- after you get through them you fight a bald guy;- then you shoot bald guy's baddies as your sister drives a quad over the desert, in what is a pretty awful sequence altogether;- then you walk a little in Morocco, following a character that explains the ""story"" to you;- then you chase a guy on the rooftops, before getting into another hand-to-hand fight with him;- then you escape the rooftops;- and then - my favorite! - you are privy to the slowest and most anti-climactic chase sequence ever! You get to drive in circles around a small area of the city, at a snail's pace, ""avoiding"" the police for a fixed amount of time.

We're spoilt for choice with the AAA games we have access to and the amazing talented devs in Europe and N. America who give us more than we can ever hope to play even. We've come to expect games to be at a certain level of craftsmanship, even small 'indie' games.

Unearthed is obviously inspired by Uncharted and has similar gameplay.  The platforming and adventure parts are pretty well done.  The combat is decent for guns but the melee combat is terrible.  The gae has definitely improved with the updates.  The driving part of the game works it just isn't very exciting.  I enjoyed the story and will probably buy the next chapter.  I enjoy episodic games and this one seems to be priced well and gives a decent game.  Keep in mind this is an indie game running on Unity so if AAA games are the only thing you enjoy, steer clear.  If you like indie games and are interested in a good story, pick it up.The card drops are ridiculous, I played the whole game and still only got two cards.  Once the main story is completed a zombie survival mode is unlocked.  Zombies, they are everywhere anymore."

A game that makes one questions the established definition of what ""entertainment"" really is. A game somagnificentthat it transcends our wildest expectations  and leaves us begging for more. Such a game has not graced this earth since Quest 64 - that is -Until now.Unearthed: The trial of Ibne Batootapaves the way for the true Golden Age of gaming. Take on the role of Blake Drake, fabled older brother of Nathan Drake from the Tomb Raider series, as he works to stop the new face of terrorism headed by 3:16 Stone Cold Steven Austin and his group of highly trained robot soldiers. Along the way, Blake, only armed with the power of friendship and his own style of mixed martial arts (and also guns), is as modest as he is kind and decides to collect the missing treasures for his closest friend Ibne Batoota who is very sad. Meanwhile, Blake's sister is kidnapped by Stone Cold's robo-thugs and she might died, but I don't know I haven't finished the game yet.Unearthedcontrols like a dream. From the stiff movement to the camera that knows what you want better than you do, controlling Blake is as natural as breathing. Coupled with truly next generation MoCap technology and animations that feel more realistic than real life - if it were any more real, it would be real. Often times I found myself pausing the game and looking around the room to double check I was not actually there in the lush deserts of France. Developer Sememaphone really let their innovation show in the games special effects, notably with the motion controlled fire andgorgeousparticle effects on the castable spells. The robot guards in-game cloaking devices were so impressiveI truly could not tell them from the games backgrounds.Peter Moneylox has really outdone himself this time, and I for one cannot wait until the next installment in theUnearthedseries. TrulyUnearthedhas set the bar for what games can achieve, and it may take years to dethrone this behemoth of a video game. While I am normally against funding terrorism, I cannot suggest enough that you buy this masterpiece.To see Unearthed in action,please click here to check out my multi-part playthrough of the game!"

,Recommended,263680,11555136,"Posted: 4 August, 2014",all,HoiHoi,"Contrary to most of the reviews that have been posted about this game, I would actually say that this is a near-masterpiece. There are certain elements in which the game falls down on, but most of its pros outweigh the cons.Let's just take a glance at the OST of Unearthed - it is very fitting to the scenarios which this game depicts, and it provides some atmosphere to the incredibly well-designed levels. Whoever composed the soundtrack deserves an award, at the minimum.The level design is something that should be appreciated as well; never before have I been lost and absolutely clueless with where to go, and that is just an indicator of well thought out level design, better than Elder Scrolls and Legend of Zelda dungeons. If an indie game can be compared to an AAA spectacle, then it definitely should deserve some praise.In terms of the lore, this game excels in story telling. You thought that the Souls series has a convoluted, ""see it your way"" experience? Well, think again! Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta delves into some extremely deep, multi-layered lore, and every word that is stated definitely had some intentionality on the developer's part. It throws in some completely irrelevant historical figures as well, which adds into the cleverly designed lore.And man, the voice acting. Mother of god, the voice acting is phenomenal. Coupled with the amazing character animations/models, this package delivers an insanely good dramatical experience. Every word is synched in with the lip movement, which adds into the immersion which this game has. You can actually opt between either the English or Arabic voice acting. Of course, since this game is to do with the Middle-Eastern/African culture, I would say that playing this game with the Arabic voice acting will provide the best results.Most importantly, however, the gameplay itself is unique. It is nice to see the action-platformer genre mixed in with walking simulation and third person shooting. The CQC combat is incredibly fun and rewarding, requiring precise reactions and input. Most games these days manifests hand-to-hand combat in the form of a glorified quick-time event, but I can reassure you that this game doesn't fall down the same trap. Did I mention the gunplay, by the way? It's brilliant. The gun models look realistic and the firing animations + damage are commendable.Seriously, this game gets my highest honour.10/10Oh yeah, Dania is my new waifu <3/s"

Buy it very cheap (<US$1), or for the achievement 100% (<US$1.50)Okay - so this is one of those games that the ""comedians"" of Steam just go on about either with brutal comments about it giving them cancer, or racist/sectist crap, or they do the lame sarcasm.This isn't one of those.What I like about this game, is their intent.  To make a Arabic/Northern African themed game of adventure and discovery.  I like the characters most of the time, and would really like to see more games coming from Arab countries make it into the mainstream (Semaphore is a Saudi game studio), as I am intrigued to hear their cultural voice applied to gaming.  The graphics are generally pretty good, though the ATV escape 'chapter' had some odd graphics quality, I think to mimic a sandstorm, but looked like a bug.  The brother and sister team is a great idea too.Where it falls down is on several levels:The camera view is horribly inconsistent, and will change on you if you get close to a wall (sometimes), and if you go to cover mode (sometimes), or sometimes for no apparent reason.  Sometimes they don't move and you wish they would,such as the left dagger room as you rope across - you can't see where you are compared to the arrows very clearly and when you are eluding the two police on foot after the sniper when you are in that foyer or whatever it is - the camera was TERRIBLE.  I also like the achievement choices, which were milestone with one straightforward collector.  It also had cards, which were themed well and a reasonable number.  The voice acting in English was ok.  Some of the translations were off (though Bride of the North is correct!) in the subtitles, and IMHO the English actors were a little better than the Arabic actors, as I played in Arabic with English subtitles part of the time to get into the game's mood a little more, but then switched back to English.The controls for me were WASD even though I had a controller installed when I played the game for the first time.  It gave me no option to use the controller, which is unfortunate, as there were times it would have been alot easier!  The wobbles on every board you walk across was annoying, given this guy is otherwise a ninja (e.g. obelisk).The game was woefully short, and at US$4.99 full price, there is no way it is worth it.  It was about an hour.  I let it run longer to get the cards.  In that short time, however, the team at semaphore tried to get every kind of chase and kickboxing fight they could, as well as some gunfights.  I was starting to wonder where Jean Claude Van Damme was since it was like a 'B' action movie.  Maybe he will do the movie version, since he is probably available these days...Finally, there were some really odd graphics choices.  The intro scene showed what I assume were Giza pyramids, but in the mountains.  There are no real mountains there, and ALOT of city growth around them.  The city of Tangier was nice, but while some elements had extreme detail, other things were undetailed, in the same area, giving it an unpolished, half-done feel.The city streets of Tangier were about 100 yards wide by 1000 yards long, endlessly repeating themselves.  I drove by the same mosque and coffee shops endlessly...So, in summary, they tried really hard, but it came off like a low budget Van Damme movie.  My threshold for value is a reasonably fun game for US$1 per hour or less.  I bought this on sale for US$1.24 and played about an hour, so it was just below the threshold.  It has cards, so it levels out at the $1 per hour.  It didn't suck, but it wasn't something I would play again, and I would have to see Episode 2 be either much longer, improved further, or very inexpensive before I would buy it at all, let alone for 'retail.'NO @ US$4.995.5/10 @ US$1.24 I paid, and 100% achieved."

There were even stealth parts and I swear that car sequence felt very GTA.Although it felt like a copy-lite, there is a clear effort in trying to make this game work beautifully. The character models look good, and there is a love in details of the environments, especially the marketplace in Morocco. Even the cats were polished, I bet a lot of time was spent in computing their data for them to look believably real. But shiny graphics aren’t enough because the whole episode itself can be easily finished in less than an hour while battling the kooky camera and somewhat immersion breaking glitches. Hopefully the next episodes would be longer and have tighter controls.Summary:Unearthed is clearly inspired heavily from a myriad of games, combining a variety of gameplays, trying to push for an epic experience, but falls short in execution which then limits the fun factor.Worth:Bought it for 1 USD but I don’t really regret it. I am curious as to where they will take this game next.Last Thoughts:Super rough around the edges but I do commend the people who worked hard on this game."

Like, really poor. It reminds me of Sonic Adventure 1 on the Dreamcast back when 3d animated models were still developing.2.) The constant hint dropping on what to do next really gets to me as a long time gamer. It may not bother others, but it realy bothers me because it doesn't let me explore. Instead I'm being led by the nose on where I need to go and what I need to do.My praises:1.) Graphically it's pretty good. It really struck me when you get to the first temple. The gate was spectacular, especially when you consider the sub par tutorial level.2.) The voice acting is also really well done. A stark contrast to the poor animation. I almost wanted to go through this game for that part alone, but I just can't bring myself to do it.If you don't have a PS3, and haven't played Uncharted... give this a shot, on sale.

By having the Arabic Protagonists follow Ibn Battuta (a person which I have never seen as the centre of a game) the game could get marks for trying to tread new ground alone. As other reviewers have noted, this is this companies first game, so it is to be expected to be buggy, but what Greenlight is for is to help small, indie-based companies get off the ground so if you're not expecting bugs then you've come to the wrong place. The Dev Team are fixing these bugs and through my first playthrough I came across very few bugs, none of which were game-breakers.All in all I found it a refreshing game treading new ground, and I can't wait for episode 2!"

There are the ruins of potential greatness nothing more to be found here.There's heart but the body around it has long decayed into dust and broken bones.Positives:-Fascinating source material (the voyages of Ibn Battuta)-Fairly intuitive gameplay (if you've played Tomb Raider or Uncharted, you will not feel lost here)Negatives:-Insultingly easy puzzles which felt like a technical demonstration of what could be done with the engine rather than actual puzzles-Disappointingly short (I finished the entire affair in less than two hours).-Clunky narrative choices and design(for instance,I learned more from the loading screens than from the dialogue and expository scenes in the game)-Frame-rate drops (this might be my machine but I've run a few recent triple-A titles without problem)Additional Comments:To be fair, going into this game, I had anticipated a disaster but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt.  However, in playing this game, I discovered the ruins of potential greatness nothing more. There's heart but the body around it has long decayed into dust and broken bones. The source material of this game (the travels of Ibn Battuta) would have made for a great game, and it seems clear that the creators were passionate about the subject matter, but no amount of passion or love will make up for poor design and at beast humdrum gameplay.On the whole, this game felt like a demo of something great that could have been but will never be. The game's puzzles and action segments seemed more a proof of concept, as if someone were showing off what he or she could do with the engine in order to attract future investors. Tellingly enough this is the first episode of many planned episodes (none of which appear to be forthcoming). It's ultimately too short; I swear that two entire segments were spent walking slowly while one character furnished some historical context, and I finished the whole thing in barely a blink of an eye.Had this been a demo or a interactive pitch, I would not have felt so disappointed. I would only recommend this game if it were free (like demos used to be).Moreover, I'm certain that you could find a used copy or a free copy of the Rihla by Ibn Battuta for next to nothing online or at your preferred bookseller and reading the text which inspired this endeavor would certainly be a better investment of your time and money."

Or is it?"

Full price is 4,99 and let's say it's worth 2 € for sure, story is worth that much, although every other aspec of the game is subpar to expected standards.Story is interesting and really makes me want to know how it continues and buy sequels. I also like it because I think that developers made an effort and gave us opportunity to learn something of the muslim culture and history. (real one, not the TV b..♥♥♥♥♥♥propaganda given by media). This is really great effort and should be rewarded.Characters are interesting and have smart and witty dialogues.Game has quite a bit of bugs and flaws. Graphic, although scenery is very nice, it is very strange at some points. Especially when chased through desert on quad. At this point graphic was totally broken.Gameplay and camera is another thing that needs additional work. Movement and camera view just does not feel natural.Have in mind that this is only episode one, so it's quite short game, but it is full of events.General pace of game and story is good, but there are 2 quite dull moments. First being walk from the tea shop to get the appartment. Most of this walk did not have dialogue. I later found out it is a bug... There is dialogut, but I did not hear it, nor I seen subtitles. Second boring part is car chase. It's just driving through the repetitive blocks avoiding police cars. It does not matter if police is on to you, just don't crash into them. There's no goal when driving, it's without purpose you can drive around one building with same result.Also I noticed bug that happens when you pause game (esc) and return to playing it. Dialogue audio will become broken and you will only read subtitles but you will not hear audio.All in all, I hope studio that designed the game will be able to fix this errors in sequel because it's game worth playing.In current condition, is not to recommend for buying on full price."

Sure, the animation isn't Polar Express quality, but that has nothing to do with fun value. The controls weren't a problem for me, which makes some of the other reviews surprising for me. Perhaps some reviewers might have mistaken difficult game play for faulty controls, or possibly used a computer that didn't have sufficient processing power to run the program properly.I enjoyed having a female character who is more like a real person with relevant aspirations, rather than another annoying, large-breasted, bikini-clad cracker-jack prize, and would like some more gameplay with her, although they seem to have put the focus on her brother, possibly to animate fewer characters.It's a very indie game, and clearly some people have a problem with that. I don't. I just wish that I could find an episode two.PS: Breaking pots = archaeology! Yes..."

,Not Recommended,263680,21960247,"Posted: 21 March, 2016",all,GaNoo,"cheap knockoff of Uncharted/Tomb Raider. Still, for a cheap knock off the story isn't half bad. It also has some decent texturing. True, the voice acting is horrible, and the animation somehow even worse...and the glitches! Don't get me started on ther glitches!Let's be honest! The game is a steaming mess! Other than a decent storyline, the game virtually has no redeeming factors! The worst part though is that it's an abuse of the ""Episodic"" game genre! It's why I hate episodic games! They can be abandoned and you never get to finish your game! This game? Prime example! It came out in 2014, and here it is 2016, and still no episode 2! The game has no ending, and likely never will!The games also WAY too short for a 5 dollar game! I know it says I spent 5.3 hours playing it, but the game was completed in about an hour and a half...Not even enough time to start getting the games playing cards! So, I had to sit and let it run so I could get them.If you absolutely MUST get it, get it on sale! It's been on sale for 99 cents...that seems like a fair price for the content in this game..any more than that is a ripoff."

,Recommended,263680,20137300,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,pupper,"I don't even know where to start with this game. The only way I can explain it is by saying Wow. Just Wow. This game is amazing. From the amazing gameplay, to the gripping story and characters, this game still ceases to dissapoint me. I will continue to play this game.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay in this game is some of the best I have ever experienced. On the outside it may just look like a typical cover shooter, but once you start to play it, you will realize how much deeper it really is. Getting kills is really satisfying, and the game rewards you for working hard. You will always be on your edge of your seat, wondering what is around the next corner. On the normal difficulty, the game is not to hard, and is not too easy. It is just perfect. However, if you want more of a challenge you can always up the difficulty in the settings.STORYThe story in this game has to be one of the best stories in a videogame, let alone a movie or book, that has ever been executed. The story in this game is definatly up there with The Witcher, The Last of Us and Metal Gear. It is just that good. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't talk to much about the characters. But holy, you are in for a treat.OTHER THOUGHTSThis game runs very well. On my GTX TITAN X, I was able to run it at max settings, 60fps, with shadows turned down to high. That is good considering this is a triple a game, and the graphics are outstanding. I personally think they are the best graphics I have ever seen on the PC.The game also has no bugs. There may be a couple, but I myself, have not run into a single one.FINAL VERDICTBy this game. You will be doing yourself a favour. I would even recomend it if it was $60. Its that amazing, so it is worth it.SCORE: 10/10 ""Wow. Just Wow.""-memes, 2015"
