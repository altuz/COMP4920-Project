,Recommended,263700,13585866,"Posted: 25 December, 2014",all,hazzaricks,"Muffin Knight is a game that looks catered towards toddlers, but is a perfect example of the idiom 'don't judge a book by its cover'. Despite looking very innocent and easy, 'Muffin Knight' is a surprisingly challenging game - especially if you're attempting to 5-star it.With a fantastic single-player and multiplayer co-op, Muffin Knight is a fast-paced game full of enjoyment, challenge and charm. Whilst the plot is simple and the graphics are subpar, Muffin Knight excels in its gameplay and can become dangerously addicting. The music is catchy, the controls are fantastically responsive and the added perks and upgrades really add to the game and genuinely make a difference, saving a very repetitive formula from going stale.My only complaints would be its lack of more settings, there isn't a lot of availability on how to customise the settings to best suit your PC, plus the menus are pretty awful if you plan to use a controller. Whilst I would highly recommend a controller for its movement flow and simplicity, I would suggest opting for a computer mouse when roaming through the menus.The randomisation for the characters can be frustrating, especially as some of the starters are incredibly weak until you upgrade them. Whilst upgrading doesn't take too long, to go from a strong character such as Cyclops or Grizzly, to a ridiculously weak character such as Monkey or Dragon, can really be annoying. Whilst mentioning characters, it is worthy ot note that the order of the unlockables seems very odd as well - whilst only a minor nitpick, I did feel very disappointed that the final unlockable was one of the worst.Overall, Muffin Knight is an incredibly fun and simplistic game to play. The added perks really help the game to feel different every time, and the challenge bar is at the perfect level for this type of genre. Whilst the plot is weak and some of the power-ups are far worse than others, due to the upgrades and points, you can quickly improve the weaker characters and make them some of the strongest. Muffin Knight is great fun with friends, but is also very enjoyable as a solo game - so go forth and find those muffins!Rating: 4/4"

I have played the android and ios versions of this game extensively, so I know there must be local multiplayer. Although technically two players can't play in one mobile device (two players should have separate mobile devices connected to the same wifi network) in their mobile app. But since this is a PC version, I was hoping it had local multiplayer the moment I voted for Greenlight way back.Fast forward to the present and I've accidentally come upon the Steam Greenlight page and decided to check out what I voted for. With one of them being Muffin Knight i thought, ""I totally forgot about getting this!"" I bought it in a heartbeat and installed this puppy on my htpc connected to the living room tv, few minutes later I played it. Ahh, the memories of me and my friends playing coop on the school wifi, me and my brother or my nephew on a muffin grind during weekend nights. Good times. I played the first two levels then I remembered why I bothered to play this game right now- i need to check how to start a game in local two-player mode, or even see if it actually has one. I was looking forward for the former. Sadly, I was utterly disappointed. There was no local multiplayer (two-players in one pc) or even the local network (wifi) multiplayer the mobile app depends for two-player games. My heart is broken.I hope the developers add the functionality of local multiplayer because this is actually a fun casual game to play with another person. I am just disappointed that basically, it's a port of their mobile app. I hope they offered something more and different. However I fear my review is too late for warranting an update regarding local multiplayer as this game is a few years old for the devs to bother updating. I hope not.I hate to say this but I would not recommend this to my friends if it doesn't have local multiplayer. I'd rather stick to the mobile apps if this would be the case (the pc version being a port of the mobile version.)Oh, and navigating with a controller in this game is AWFUL."

Then I played for what felt like 10 minutes which was actually 3 hours later.. This game is addicting and fun worth every penny! Don't let me disclude time consuming.. So Z is the shoot key and I think both my finger and the Z key are done for...11/10 would suffer again"

Figured I could use it here as well because WHY NOT![edit]""Full controller support"" shouldn't be listed, just a caution to any would-be buyers looking to enjoy this game using ONLY a controller. Controller support could definitely be better; had to revert back to keyboard and mouse to navigate some parts of the menu, and it just feels kind of janky overall. That said, actual gameplay controls work well enough with an xbox controller."

That's why I had to have it on PC.This game is awesome on the go, and very addicting, very fun arcade kindof game with a fairytale graphics twist.It's kindof similar to Super Crate Box. They took the idea from Super Crate Box, which was the first game of this type.Xbox controller support and everything. Really fun."

Once you get to a certain point it just gets extremely hard farming for those muffins. And muffins are just traps for the monster to spring out and slap you on the♥♥♥♥♥ And then you have to get to level 1 million to even beat this damn game. So overall this game is evil and depressing, thats why you should get this game :D."

This is one of the laziest ports I think I've ever seen, seeming to have had no changes to make it more fit for a PC. There are no options for whether you could run the game in a window, you're stuck in fullscreen. Even if you used the Alt+Enter trick to put in in windowed mode, you better have a huge monitor because the game runs in like 123481596x123458712349 pixels. I have dual monitors, and it took both monitors to display the whole game in windowed mode. Don't get this on Steam. Get it on your phone. Actually, don't get it at all, get Super Crate Box. That game is free.I do realize that I put absolutely no time into actually playing the game, but the limited options regarding window size killed the whole experience for me, because windowed mode is my preference."

Jumping around trying to get the other person killed by the monsters before they do the same to you is fun, especially when the muffins change you everytime you grab one. There is a basic level up progression and character unlock and you will unlock everything with just playing the game.Fun in increments of 30 minutes or so on random occasions with a buddy."

Muffin Night is by far, one of the most fun and adictive games Ive ever played! Its hilarious, silly, cute, and at the same time a really nice real-time-strategy game. Wether its the fantasticly comical graphics, the storybook plot, or the hilarious characters to play as, I always have a great time playing! But there are some downsides. This game has the exact premise of Super Crate Box, which is free (And I recommend it) and the price is a little iffy for what you get. But, since there's more to come, you can always count on Muffin Night to make your day!"
