Keep in mind its still in ""BETA"" so lot of features are not there yet like Single-Player campaign or vast collection of characters, modes and stages (they are likely to come soon however).The price is not steep so i recommend picking the game out with a friend or two and have some fun on the arena."
,Not Recommended,263720,34117697,Posted: 8 August,all,Arctiq,"It's a fun for a Smash Bros clone. They took the best elements that everyone likes from Melee and make them into actual mechanics, like wave dashing. However, there are various balancing and networking issues that make it unfun at times.The characters are really cool, too. My personal favorite is the walrus, whos moveset is a combination of both Donkey Kong and Sub Zero. They've also recently added the Hyper Light Drifter guy, who's moveset works really well in a 2D party brawler, albeit a bit overpowered. I'm looking forward to more cameo fighters in the future.This game has a lot of potential, but with the current lack of stages, modes and content in general, I'd hold off on this game. Especially when there's frequent latency issues in online matches. I personally wouldn't buy it at $20 at it's current state. Wait till it's on sale."

Maybe in order to get more characters the game developers can talk to more indie developers to use characters such as Shovel Knight and their likes. This would also include backgrounds from themes of those characters. Shovel Knight would be cool. Other than roster, I cannot see why this game would not be a viable alternative to Smash Bros."
,Not Recommended,263720,34119116,Posted: 8 August,all,Corporate Shinobi,"TLDR: Just buy Rivals of Aether.Actual Review:As a competitor in multiple fighting games, the one that means the most to me is Super Smash Brothers Melee. So naturally, whenever a new platform/smash-esque fighter pops up, my first instinct is to try it. I've dabbled in Brawhalla (though not on this account) and I've played a fair bit of Rivals of Aether. I've played every type of spinoff, Playstation All Stars, Shrek Super Slam, etc. I have a passion for these sorts of games. So it surprised me when Brawlout was unbearably disappointing. Characters didn't have a strong ""pop"" to them (other than Paco, he's cool asf), stages were designed seemingly with no attention to competitive play or casual play (not enough hazards for casuals, not enough balanced stages for competitive. Really? Half of Smash's battlefield?). Every move has the sound effects of a light slap, yet sends opponents flying off screen. There really isn't much depth here either. Whereas a game like Rivals introduce Parrying, multiple types of cancels, walljump integration, and a quick tutorial to communicate it all, Brawlout has little to nothing. It removes grabs and shielding. ""Fair enough,"" I thought, ""Rivals did the same thing and I love that game"". But there was nothing to replace it. Nothing was added, things were only taken away. The inclusion of wavedashing seems completely pointless, as if just having such a mechanic in the game will attract players. Melee players don't like wavedashing just because ""WE CAN WAVEDASH"". We like it because it expands on movement options and how the neutral is played. In Brawlout, it just seems like a weaker version of regular movement, as it is not only laggy, but has similar options as the stock dash (because dashes and dash momentum have little to no endlag). The combo system feels ripped from traditional fighters, but with how far characters are launched, the combos don't last long either. Again, this would be fine if characters died quickly. But every character has an almost ludicrous recovery. When you see the aforementioned Paco, with arguably one of the weaker recoveries, get back from offscreen bottom right/left, you know something is wrong.Now to be fair, this is the only truly 3D Smashlike I've seen on Steam. It looks pretty standard issue for an early access game. Why then, do my GPU and CPU fans spin up as if my PC is about to take off? I'm running a fairly modern system (4GB GTX970, an i5-4690k, pretty bog standard ""VR-Ready"") and despite the game looking mediocre at best, it stresses my whole PC. I almost can't hear the generic music and the characters that make little to no noise (Which again, lends to that whole ""pop"" factor they lack). I know some will defend it, saying, ""pretty good for early access"". Well with a 20 Dollar price tag, ""Pretty Good FOR EARLY ACCESS"" doesn't cut it. Premium Price, Premium Product. Similar early access games (Distance, Rivals, hell even Sword With Sauce) have massive jumps in both quality and perfomance efficiency. To my knowledge, they have even SMALLER development teams. It's a shame, because some of the ideas here are really cool. Characters like Paco, Hyper Light Drifter, and (I don't know, I'll just call him Bristleback) have movesets that, set in any other Smashlike, would be incredibly fun to use. But it's Brawlout. So they aren't. Wavedash games is cooking up their new game, ""Icons: Combat Arena"". The footage from that game's PRE-ALPHA/ALPHA stages looks far more interesting than this game's MID BETA. Sure it may lack the ""polish"", but that can come with time. A game that is not good from the foundation will not become good. To adapt a rather crude saying,  ""You can polish a turd, but you cannot make it gold.""Pros:+Fun character mechanics (in concept)+A couple stage backgrounds look niceCons:-Weak movement options-Poor competition to other games in the genre, better alternatives out there.-Price is too high-Characters lack personality-Poor Optimization-Weak overall presentation-Lack of depth"

It's also less skill based because of that, is that okay? I had fun.You can't group up with a friend online to fight 2 (or more?) other people, that would make this game very enjoyable.Rating: 7.5/10Value: $14 > less, I would say is fair until they make some of the above changes."
,Not Recommended,263720,33025508,Posted: 29 June,all,Brendon Small,"Competitive Melee player perspective here, so expect some nitpick-iness. So, for being touted as a competitive platform fighter, this game falls well below the mark set by other entries in the genre, ESPECIALLY Super Smash Bros. Let me individually cover every reason this game falls short (in my eyes) of not only being a good competitive game, but an enjoyable experience.1.) Movement: Movement in this game feels extremely sluggish. Whereas in many Smash clones, you have a dash that allows for quick bursts of movement and dash-dancing, this game has no such thing. The wavedash mechanic also feels extremely finnicky and forced. In Melee, it exists simply as a byproduct of the airdodge mechanic. In this, airdodging into the ground FORCES you to slide. It looks and feels awful, especially since the game lacks the other movement options to supplement it and make it useful.2.) Combos: They exist...kinda. This game has next to no hitstun, so the only combos you're gonna get are like, jab combos. Everything else is down to reads, due to a combination of no hitstun, and not enough mobility to be able to follow up on things.3.) Animations: In Smash and many of it's clones, a big part of making the game feel good is having animations that read well. This game doesn't have that. It can be hard to put your finger on at times, but a lot of moves look unnecessarily sluggish, and many action states don't transition well into each other. The game just looks overall clunky.4.) The Overall Mechanics: I'm glad they listened to the community about ledges (although I don't really agree with how they implemented them), but the game still has too many mechanics that are anti-competitive. Namely rage. I would make rage toggleable (if it isn't already? I couldn't find an option) because in its current form, it isn't exciting to play with OR against. There's essentially no counterplay when your opponent has it other than running away. (which is unlikely to be successful because movement is so janky)So yeah. I'm not impressed so far. If an update somewhere down the line fixes the janky movement and actually makes this game FEEL good to play, I'll totally be on board. But until then, it feels borderline unplayable to me."

76561197961437646,Not Recommended,263720,34158553,Posted: 10 August,all,EMC,"I was suckered into buying this game because I saw a Kotaku article showing it added the Drifter from Hyper Light Drifter. I read through the reviews, saw some bad, some good, I bought it. I regret my purchase sincerely. I can't recommend it as a party game because every move is so sluggish. If you think you're gonna play this like Smash Bros (Melee as it's advertised or Brawl / 4 if it's what you're used to), this game is nothing like them. The only similarity is that you have a % bar that launches you further.. But even that is ♥♥♥♥ed up. I've ""smashed"" other characters at 200% and they did not die. They barely even moved. There's a super meter that builds and they literally give you 15 seconds of invincibility. I have no idea how they plan on fixing all the glaring issues with this title. You have to play it for around an hour to truly understand everything that's wrong with it. The controls are sluggish and sloppy, the moves are cheap and make no sense. The hitboxes are terrible. It feels like this strange hobbled together cash grab with a few good ideas. Being able to watch other matches while you wait for your own is cool. A lax 1v1 and a ranked 1v1 is cool.. That's about it."

The characters are not balanced, for exemple Sephi'ra, isn't balanced at all. I had a player using her that was using a overpowered combo and i couldn't do anything about it.2. A lot of characters can be played as spam (almost all of them), so that makes it less fun.3. When falling from the edge, we can't save ourselfs from falling after a certain level.4. The queuing system while doing ranked games, is bad. For instence, after a match, you can fall on the same person you just fought over and over again.One thing that i can suggest is a hanging of the edge system, a bit like in super smash bros brawl, as well as items.Nerver the less, the game is in early access so these flaws are natural and the game will keep growing! In the majority, the level designs are really well made, the caracter design and their moves are also really well designed! I am having a lot of fun playing the game."
,Not Recommended,263720,34469279,Posted: 24 August,all,Kid,"Brawlout is a platform fighter game that appears to be strongly influenced by games like smash bros and brawlhalla. There are a few things I thought were pretty cool about the game, the graphics look really nice and seem to be really well optimized as my pc could run the game on max setting at about 400-600 fps the whole time. The character design is pretty interesting too with strongly cohesive kits that fit stick to and make use of the characters look to create an imersive fighter.However there are many more things about this game that just didnt make it stick for me and made me want to stop playing. First the player base is very small taking around 5 to 10 minutes just to find a short 3ish minute match, this is not something that is really the developers fault and may improve over time but as of now online play just doesnt seem that fun because it takes twice as long to find a match as it does to play one. Next in single player vs cpu there are no differences in difficulties to my knowledge making it so once you've mastered beating the cpus it is no longer challenging and as I said with the queue times earlier its not even very worth it to switch to online multiplayer. Third, their are very few character (which is expected mostly of early access) but they claim that they plan to add two or three more by release, that will total in around 10 characters. Arguably that could be enough for I fighting game since games like lethal league thrive with only 6, but the magnitude of competetive play this strives for versus lethal league is very different as lethal league is meant to be a much simpler game at its core. The amount of characters put into this game doesnt even take much time to learn them all. Once again without higher cpu difficulty levels and with sluggish online play I believe this game would benefit greatly from at least having more characters game like smash start you out with around 30 characters to play allowing for much better replayability as you learn to master all of the different character and playstyles. Further more and this may be purely my personal opinion but the movement in this game feels a little clunky whether with controller or keyboard the characters feel rather unresponsive often resulting in a move executing to late, not at all, or the wrong move happening. Lastly another personal opinion is I dont care for the way abilities chain, it feels like there are to many true combos in this game with no frames for recovery in between with these inescapable combos and nearly map wide moves like those seen on king apu and gancho puncho the gameplay seems kindof broken and slightly unfit for competitve play.I very well might try this game again in the future once its out of early access but as for now I do not think this game is worth playing as what it does games like smash and brawlhalla still do better and with higher player bases.Good luck to the development team, I'll be back.TLDR:Character design and game optimization are solid, but between clunky gameplay, broken abilities and combos, lack of depth to cpu fights, and low playerbase game is not worth in its current state."

However, the higher ups, if you will, both developers and moderators in the discord, are some of the worst I have ever seen in a game. One abusive moderator in particular bans players who do not agree with a general consensus (i.e., even being critical of the game) from the discord and will block you as well like some kind of special snowflake, lack of transparency by the development team and just bad business practices all around (save for microtransactions, I'll give them that but I won't be surprised if that changes too). The game itself is ok, probably one of the better smash clones on PC (which really doesn't say much) but has been stagnant for over a month now with no discernible update to the game, despite the original promise of it being updated every two weeks. The game itself is incredibly jank with stiff animations, spotty netcode and questionable balancing decisions, as the two best characters for months still reign supreme (the other best player in NA and I decided to soft-ban one of the characters for that reason). It's also a paid game for some asinine reason, which only makes the already small (I haven't seen it peak higher than 25 at the absolute most) even smaller. One of the few redeeming factors is that the majority of the community of the game don't take it so serious but good luck saying anything, since they will permanently ban you for saying mean things.Stay away from this game. I, for one, tried being helpful in the community, offering both criticism and positive feedback but they don't want the help of others and certainly not from their best players because feelings get hurt. Let this game stay in the obscurity it deserves."
,Recommended,263720,31385341,Posted: 26 April,all,Steph-sama,"Unlike Rivals of Aether where most of your high damage combos are mainly in the air, Brawlout offers a more fundamental grounded gameplay. So theres lots of solid grounded combos as well as air combos and a great level of footies. I'm never thought I'll see the day where I can say theres footies in a party brawler, but damn don't this game make playing neutral fun. Tech and gameplay seems to be a good middle ground between Smash 4 and Melee. So you can wavedash (pretty far with some characters) and air dodge to recover, kinda like Rivals of Aether, and like Rivals of Aether, there's no shields but instead to step dodge in place or you rolled right before the attack connects for a clean get away.All and all, this game is fun. Yeah its unfinished, there's come bugs and  it seems there some moves missing and there's not a tilts for every direction, but I'm sure with time, well see this game becomes the super slick competitive party brawler there is. Maybe even show up as a regular game at Smash Cups tournaments .So uh, yeah, go play this game. It stand out enough to not be a straight up Smash Rip-off,"
,Not Recommended,263720,31563839,Posted: 5 May,all,Kryyss,Considering that this game is fresh out onto Steam and has ESL endorsement I had to wonder why the multiplayer was so utterly barren. When playing today I repeatedly ended up facing the same 2-3 players [ConR being one that I remember vividly] over and over despite doing a fresh match search. Whats more is that the matchmaking systems seems to think that pairing someone with 500 points against someone who has 1500 points and is clearly very experienced matches for a fun experience.There really isn't much content to the game and you can't practice against the AI since it is extremely easy causing there to be a huge gulf between them and players. The game clearly has some great and well balanced content inspired by Smash Bros but without a decent sized community and a reasonable match making system it's not something I can recommend without it being significantly cheaper or F2P.

,Recommended,263720,31263439,Posted: 20 April,all,Fynwell,"So as an avid Smash Bros fan in my younger days. It's easy to welcome an inspired version come to the PC with open arms. When I first saw Brawlout I was instantly attracted to it's aesthetic. It's not visually overwhelming and it does a fantastic job of keeping you engaged without many distractions whilst you are fighting. The game runs smooth as silk with more than 200+ FPS for me which you can limit in your options menu and pretty much adjust it accordingly.The fighting is exactly how you would expect from a game like this. Pretty fast-paced, with a variant of move sets and combinations you can pull off. The game focuses it's attention purely on the fighting, there is no items to grab as of yet that I'm aware of. When it comes to the multiplayer you can private host, Join a quickplay match, or even test your skills in ranked mode. But it's only stable at the moment in a 1v1 scenario which is honestly disappointing. You can also choose from 6 characters and 5 Stages to Brawl with and more expected come launch.Overall right now I think the game has a ton of potential but the lag issues and the lack of modes such as 2v2 only being in the private lobby concerns me. Being beta I hope these fixes are in the works ASAP. I would keep an eye on Brawlout if you're a fan of these style of games."

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm talking like, 5FPS, a literal slideshow where the game is completely unplayable)- Sloppy inputs (you press left special and it performs an up special, for example).- They say there's right stick/C-stick support but I've been able to find out where this is hidden.EDIT: Adding my specs below for a point of reference so you know my FPS issues aren't hardware related:Specs:AMD FX-Series FX-6300NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 GB16GB DDR3 RAM"

If brawlout could somehow get it's hands on some more characters from steam games such as shovelknight, tf2 heavy, maybe malric from chivalry (lol) I think it could really have a chance to explode into popularity. I just don't see people growing much of an attachment to these generic animal characters. Drifter plays and feels extremely well as a character. So much that I don't wanna touch any of the others. The game plays well otherwise. It just feels plain. There doesn't seem to be any items, no grabbing, and hardly any stages to choose from."

The matches has a nice flow, the characters are distinct from one another and some of the maps feature destructible environment which adds a bit more depth to them than other games.Some would say that the character- and map roster is a bit small (there are 6 characters at the moment), but when the characters are this well-designed I don't feel that there's a need to have 20 or 40 different characters. As for the maps I don't really know what to say. I've never been the guy that puts that much thought on maps I suppose. The few they have right now looks good.Good game, I'd give it a 10/10 if it wasn't for the fact that I've only played it for a very short while now."

,Recommended,263720,32069168,Posted: 30 May,all,Jeff Goldblum,"Part of me really wants to love this game. As someone who loves both fighting games and party games tremendously. I prefer how this game plays over the more popular Rivals of Aether, with some more polish I think it could really be a solid title.However as it currently stands, in Early Access it's certainly not worth the full price of admission. The game is still in beta, so expect bugs, some maps are worse than others, but for me I tested it out on the first stage with 4 bots with no issues, then I tried it with the ice stage and was suffering large framerate issues where the game was basically unplayable unless I quit.The art style is actually fairly nice, simple, but the characters are easily different enough from one to the next, and gameplay wise, this feels a lot more smash-like to me than Rivals of Aether does, and perhaps that's just due to the 2 attack buttons and dodging as opposed to Rival of Aether's 3 attacks + counter system.I will probably refund this game for the time being, and hold out for more development, but honestly if you're curious there is some fun to be had here. It may vary, depending on the amount of people you bring in with you with the aformentioned frame rate problems, but mechanically this game works decently, it looks decent, and it can be fun. I look forward to seeing the story modes, and polish being added to this someday when it leaves Early Access as I think this game could be a solid pick for playing with friends online or locally."

,Not Recommended,263720,33565455,Posted: 15 July,all,/T.B.\ Lewn1e,"Game was a nice idea, but the devs have no idea how to implement anything, or balance any character, so It's nothing but frustration to play. The people who enjoy playing it are the people that just use whatever character is most broken at the time. It's not fun, not in the least.If you're looking for a clunky, buggy, unbalanced, slow mess of a game, that even though is in EA the devs don't actively make any attempt to acknowledge community feed back then this is your game.If you're looking for a game that takes everything good about smash games and makes it bad, then keeps the bad stuff, then you'll be in heaven here.I DO NOT reccommend getting this game, you'd be supporting what is essentially a cash grab at this point.[EDIT]:Can I make a review more negative somehow? Like ""Negative++""? Seriously, in the roughly 2 months since my last review nothings changed aside from 1 new character that's a crossover from Hyper Light Drifter, which they did to mooch off of it's current fan base and try to get more people to buy their poor excuse for a game. Theres been next to no attempts at balancing characters, and even with help from their players they still managed to completely butcher the new character. Sure, he feels somewhat faster and smoother compared to the rest of the cast, almost like what a platform fighter character should feel like. That is, unitl you spend a few hours playing him and see just how clunky he can be, with so many moves having ridiculous ending lag, while others have literally none.They still haven't changed their god aweful ledge hang mechanic despite literally everyone ive seen talk about it has said it needs to be changed. Still a terrible game, still terrible devs, serioulsy DO NOT BUY IT."

,Not Recommended,263720,31264675,Posted: 20 April,all,3Rton,"2017 would seem to be shaping up to be the year of platform fighters (or brawlers or ssb-fighters or PFs here on I'll use PF for platform fighter). Brawhalla, Rivals of Aether and now Brawlout. (Potentially during 2017 we will also get first reveal of the Wavedash teams game) These games have all a lot in common. They are very stylised. Both RoA and Brawlout feature non-humanoids only. Most importantly all of these games are draining inspiration from the one and only king of games like these: the super smash brothers series by Nintendo. Last year was pretty damn crazy for Smash. Melee kept on steady growth pace from the earlier years. Smash 4 had phenomenal growth both in tournament size, participants and technical level.What does any of this have to do with anything? Well to say whether you should or shouldn't buy Brawlout (and whether it is good or not for that matter) entirely depends on what are you looking for in the game.I'm going to be writing from my personal perspective. From the perspective of a person who is looking for an alternative, better than alternative, for Smash 4. What I want is a game that doesn't just reach the level of Melee and Smash 4 but bridges the gaps between the two games.For melee: makes a rooster where actually all the characters will be viable even after 10 years, is modern, isn't stuck up about what people use to play the game and has a developer that supports both the esports, modding/art and casual scene. For Smash 4: make the game a little bit faster, make the movement/tech skill little bit more complex, add offline tournament mode, offline comp mode..You get the idea.Is Brawlout that? No. And it probably isn't trying to be. To talk about the game generally it doesn't have any fundamentally ""wrong"" qualities. The art style is very pleasing, characters are unique aesthetically and play style wise, the game has decent level of polish.However, the game play just isn't what I'm looking for (albeit it decent fun)- Brawlout makes quite an interesting choice basic mechanic wise: It has removed both grab/throw and shield functionality from the game. The main interactions of the game consist of attacks, special attacks and dodging (and some kind of rage meter that affects moves and apparently has combo break esque functionality but since I wasn't in the beta I don't know how it works.) This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I certainly dislike it.- Other option wise things that seem to be different: there seems to be no dash dancing, wavedashing, ledge options, wall jumps, no weak/tilt moves, no crouching and no techs.These are all in themselves sort of negative things but not deal breakers. What evidently is the biggest issue for me is just the feeling.In smash when you float in the air, when you perform ground movement (foxtrot, dash dance, PPs, wavedash..), when you  get hit by those Sheik forward tilts, when you hot someone with Bowser forward smash.. there is constantly that tangible feeling of weight. The characters feel like physical objects with mass and the attacks feel like powerful moves with strength to send the characters across the map. It is hard to put in words but Brawlout just lacks this. There is definitely aesthetic element to this but also a feel one.Aesthetically the attack, hit and knock back effects and the animation don't really sell it.Feeling wise it is probably combination of many things (attack animations, hitstun, knock back) but the game just doesn't have weight.This is emphasised by very confusing situations. Sephira's (purple cat) kick that looks very similar to Sheik's forward tilt in Smash 4 can KO from the edge of arena. You'll look at the kick hit you and think ""I should probably DI this down to avoid follow up"" and the you'll explode on the blast zone. In other hand charged Olaf up smash barely kills from center stage until closer to 200%. Olaf down smash (which looks lighter and like it would spike) in other hand can relatively easily KO from the top by shooting them up vertically (in an almost straight line) (A lot of attacks look deceptive and have really weird launch angles. This is made worse by not having clear visual indicators of how heavy you were hit and how much knockback you received)A lot of the visual cues just seem weird.I'm probably going to get shredded by someone from the beta who is going to point out that all the technical mistakes/misunderstandings I have.This is, however, the impression I got from 2 hours of ranked and quick play. Whether I'm qualified to say this is arguable. I used to play a lot of SF, Blazblue and Melee before fighting games started to get releases in steam. I have probably around 200-300 hours played in Smash 4.Anyhow my final verdict would be:- Brawlout has lot of potential to be a fun, polished platform fighter (both online and local play wise)- The developers got a lot right (pretty stages, interesting characters, most of the basic things like UI, modes etc, the game recognised gamecube pad)Should you buy Brawlout?- If you want to support platform fighter genre, smaller developers: yes.- If you want to buy a platform fighting game that isn't weapon based or pixel art: yes.- If you want an alternative for Smash 4 and Melee while you wait for Melee HD and emulator that can run Smash 4? Then probably not.It'll be interesting to see where Brawlout goes from here. There is a lot of improvements they can make in many different aspects. I hope that Mobgames will prove me wrong and make Brawlout the next big Platform Fighter. But for now I'm bit a bit sceptic about the chances of that happening."

They will spam it until they freeze you and then attack, freeze, attack, freeze, attack. Dodging only helps you for so long until one connects and then they do a ton of damage. This character needs a nerf badly.BrawlOut does a good job of giving me that Smash Bros feel. It is still very new, so there are only 6 characters with the one mentioned above being incredibly overpowered. Hopefully they add 2v2 online modes in the future, so you can play against people online with a friend. I would say it isn't worth $20 at this time.

,Not Recommended,263720,31268769,Posted: 20 April,all,Brentmeister,"Overall, this game does little to impress. If you want your Smash Brother's fix go check out Brawlhalla which has been out for several years now.Cons:Super super laggy. Game appears to be Peer-To-Peer so I don't expect that to change ever. The whole game stops when someone lags.Joystick Controls are sloppy for a brawler. There is no tolerance for the inaccuracies innate to support game pads. This means your character may snap to another direction you don't push in. It also makes it incredibly difficult to pull off moves requiring you to hold your joystick any direction but forward.Matchmaking is very slow especially for a launch day game. Took 5 minutes to get into my first match. On average took well over a minute with many people ""dodging"" the match.Ranked seems fundamentally flawed. You can't fall below your starting ranking (hello rating inflation!).Pros:Some of the characters are kind of neat. The unique movesets are fun. There seem to be huge deltas in balance though.Other notes on combat:Closer to Super Smash Brother Melee in terms of mechanics (now with added lag on everything!).  Juggling is very really, there are long delays between getting hit and regaining control of your characters. This means true combos are very real in this game."

,Recommended,263720,35006656,Posted: 16 September,all,Spruzo,"I am a Smash 4 player (1500+ hours on my console alone) who always wanted to get into melee but the lack of updated control schemes, and melee skill ceiling always detured me. It would take a couple page article to explain every detail and how it compares but trust me when I say this is a very good game with loads of potential.Pros:-Graphics are beautiful. Animations are fluid and crisp. It really does look like a fun game I could play casually with friends.-Gameplay is fast. No landing lag so no need to L-cancel. When you are in advantage state it's easier to stay there than in Smash 4. Disadvantage state feels fair due to the rage mechanic (google it).-Characters, while few, are fun to play and have a personality to them. Nothing like Overwatch levels of personality but they feel more dimensional than Rivals of Aether fighters.-Dev team is extremely responsive and receptive. Join the discord channtel and you will have an opportunity to shape the game. Devs really do care about the game and want to listen so make your voice heard!Cons:-Not a whole lot of people online at the moment. If you want to find a match hop into the discord server and ask someone to play. I think everyone goes online, doesn't get matched for 10+ minutes, and then goes back to melee/smash4/brawlhalla/RoA... etc. Once the community grows it will be fine.-This game is $20. It will most likely go F2P with loot boxes but at this time you gotta shell out some cash.I personally would have spent more money (no doubt price will increase on full release and on Switch). Angry Mob's take on platform fighters isn't necessarily the ''smash killer'' or innovative enough to push the genre forward. However, what Angry Mob does have is a well thought out and executed gem which checks all the right boxes.Edits: spelling and such"
