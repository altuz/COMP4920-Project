I see no reason why i should have to spend 5 hours unlocking items to play multiplayer with my friends.I got about halfway through the campaign and couldn't bear it anymore.  again, maybe worth it on a sale if you're prepared to grind, but i was very disappointed i couldnt just jump into an enjoyable multiplayer experience.TLDR:  A potentially great multiplayer game with friends ruined by a tedious single player progression system that for some reason translates into multiplayer."
,Not Recommended,263740,22525173,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,RockstarCRO,"FootLoL enticed me with its soccer theme and its madness on the field. Upon playing the game a little bit more, it's definitely not for me. I'm not a casual gamer by any means but do like playing games like this in-between other games. Reason I cannot recommend it is that it gets boring after a while. I may find it boring, you may not. Heck, I'm sure kids would like this game.An emphasis on strategy should be put here rather than soccer. Although soccer seems to be the main theme of the game, you (as the player) have about zero control over the players on the pitch. The only thing you can control is placing tactical objects or weapons on the pitch. Some of the weapons that are included are land mines (which blow-up opponents when they are near), meteorites where meteors will literally come from the sky and hit the field, a herd of cows can be used to flatten your opponent, ball multipliers to increase the amount of goals you score when the ball goes into the net and not limited to turrets. Counter-measures are also included to help you defend your players from your opponent. Armor can be equipped, bubble spheres can be erected to protect players (or the ball from moving forward), speed boosts or speed traps, protective bubble shields that can block ball and players as well as the ability to expand the opponents net. There are A LOT of weapon options in game which is a great feature.The players themselves do not make much of an effort to dodge any of the obstacles. Essentially, they have positions but players will move near the ball if it's close by. The game feels pretty balanced. Deciding which weapons to take to the ""battle""field can literally make a night and day difference in the score. Choose the wrong power-ups or use them too much and watch your score stay stagnant. There are a few game modes in FootLoL : championship mode where you tour the world/solar system, quick match and multiplayer mode. Most players will most likely choose to pursue championship mode before anything else. In championship mode you start with a certain amount of slots and certain amount of abilities. As the game progresses (and the better you do in-games), the cash-rewards become a lot bigger. The AI within the game also becomes progressively difficult although most of the time beating him isn't the most difficult. Meeting certain objectives laid out before hand is where the challenge lies. Each match is timed and the team with the most goals when the clock hits zero, wins. The better the performance and the more conditions that are met means a better payout. Don't forget though, your opponent can possess the same abilities as you!Visually, the game play is cool because there is a lot going. Watching meteors fall from the sky while sheep are running across the field while blobs are blocking certain players can get insane. As I said, visually watching it is cool. Playing it is a completely different story (because this is where the limitations start coming in).The biggest issue for me is that this feels like a game I would play on the iPad. I understand the ""mobile gaming"" platform is slowly evolving and yes programmers should get some credit where credit is due, but I certainly do not like purchasing games that could be played on an iPad (on a rig that costs a lot more than one). As I've said, if you're into strategy and something a little bit different with some outlandish effects, I'm sure you'll enjoy the game. If you're here for some soccer or some sort of inclusiveness, it's not here. If they added a gimmick or something in which you could control players, I'm sure that would have added another depth to the game.Overall, I won't recommend it as it's not my cup of tea. However, if you do like this (even for a full price), I would recommend getting it. I think there was enough put into the game to get enough bang for your buck.RATING : 6.0/10GameplayCStory / CampaignC+Visuals / User InterfaceB-Sounds / MusicCReplay-abilityC+OverallCScreenShots :Championship mode viewAbilities upgrade menuThe meteor effects are pretty good and deliver a solid umphMeteor after-effectThere is a lot you can do in this game that could be considered cheatingWeapon options"

,Recommended,263740,9885347,"Posted: 20 April, 2014",all,NAKANO,"I'm not a fan of football games, but this did make me rethink the fun we can have with football. This game's genre (what I think) is Real Time Strategy (although you cannot control the players), because this game needs you to make decisions whenever you think the team might need some support, and because this game is not turn-based (as you can see in the video in steam store). If you play Battlefield 4, it's like having a pocket sized commander mode, very small map, giving support to your fellowmen. I did enjoy doing that,, until I've done around 40% of the Earth Stage. Since I'm a perfectionist, I tend to get all the challenges done (challenges are written at the top left of the screen, with scores you have to have in order to complete the challenge). This REALLY gets harder and harder for me, as a strategy game newbie. I did also see myself doing some facepalm because I was being serious with just a game *facepalm*. For now, I would recommend you buy this, instead of buying snacks that will be a pleasure for few minutes, and buy this game, which will be playable for such a long time. It's definately not a game you would want for Dota2-like competition, but rather for fun like throwing grenades at each other in PAYDAY2. So, yeah, don't buy if you're pro at Dota2...Other informations- From what I've played, 1 stage is around 1;00~2;00, with endless replayability. It does not have any RPG features, except maybe the skills or upgrades you can buy with the income.And last but not the least, the game is VERY light compared to the price, with 96MB of installation and around the half for download... Guys, I really don't know if I should recommend this.. -.-"

You do not control the players themselves, but have to guide them to scoring goals by using power-ups in the right way- lots of power-ups with different characteristics: meteors, cows, flak cannons, air strikes, shields, teleporters, ball clones, crazy fans and a lot more- RPG-ish upgrades to improve your team and cosmetics (new flags, eyes, hats etc.)- Pretty nice sound effects, especially when you spam the pitch with different power-ups simultaneouslyThe negative aspects:- strange goals. Sometimes it happens that you put the ball wide, but then it drops into the net, counting as a goal.- gameplay gets repititive after a short time- 2D/3D graphics mashup. You're getting used to that, but putting the 2D players into 3D would have been nice- The biggest counterpoint surely is the strange tasks you have to complete. In most of the games you have to complete three tasks, which are always special scores. For example, for the first task the game wants you to lead by 3-0, for the second task to be down by 3-7, and for the third/final task to win by a 5-goal margin.On the one hand, this gameplay element adds some tactical depth into the game as you sometimes have to support the opponent's team and sabotage your own squad. Otherwise - pardon me - strange thing to support somebody you have to beat, isn't it? Like corrupting the game. And I don't think that FIFA developed this game- multiplayer is as good as dead, unfortunatelyResult (and summary for those who have no time reading):Ok, basically FootLOL is a fun football game with entertaining gameplay and a huge variety of power-ups to reach your goals. Though there are some counterpoints, like strange goals and tasks to complete, you can have a nice time spamming the field with cows and meteors. I recommend you to try it out (at sales time)!"

,Recommended,263740,9921889,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"FootLOL is a fun take on football, but unfortunately manages to stay fresh for only a few hours or so. It's best played in short sessions of about 30 minutes. You don't actually control any of the players but you can help them out by keeping them safe, or by hurting your enemies. You do this by using power-ups.Your team will shoot when they're near the goal and they'll do the best they to keep the enemy from scoring. Finishing ('winning' is the better word here) matches will earn you money and completing objectives will earn you even more money. This money is used to use more power-ups, or to let you choose more of them, or to improve the AI of your team, for example.The graphics are simple and the sound effects are very basic but it has a certain charm, I guess.There are several worlds to complete so it will take at least a couple of hours to complete it. I grew tired of it before that, but it was a fun, unusual game anyway.If you like casual games about football/soccer FootLOL is the game you're looking for.[Rating: 72/100]"

,Recommended,263740,28815289,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,aruvin,"FootLOL: Epic Fail League developed by Lion's Shade & released on 17 Sep 2013 on the PC platform. On Metacritic(http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/footlol-epic-fail-league), it has:An average user score of 5.2, from 3 critics only -at the time of this writing.What would you expect from a game that combines soccer with cows, mines, spartans, cannons, UFOS and air plane bombers & other unspeakable objects of destruction(s)? If you answered a logical, reasonable, responsible gaming experience – Shows you the red card out *blows whistle* You are dismissed from the field!But on a serious note, is this title really worth the money/time for all the utter insane chaos? It's really hard to say depending on how you view it.FootLoL is not your normal standard soccer game. It's not about winning but rather making the other team fail. Wait, isn't that the same? No. And sometimes, you make your own team fail. Wait, what? Yes, you heard me right. If it doesn't make sense, not everything has to make sense and sometimes you have to defy logic for a gaming experience out of this world. That's partically what FootLOL tries to deliver. An Utter Out of this world holy cow chaos beyond oblivion pancakes with 'WTF” stamped on it.FootLoL offers 3 game mode:A campaign – I believe there are 60 levels that span across 4 planets. Yes, it's serious intergalactic domination business.A quick match – A standard game with 4 types of specific game play for you to pick fromOnline play – Similar to quick match but you have the option to play online with friends/against other playersControls & Visuals:FootLol controls is very simple. As for the visuals, for me it's okay. It's not pixelated, everything looks simple & clean. I have no complains on this 2 department. Controls, mechanics is working as intended, nothing is broken and no bugs encountered.FootLOL even allows you to customize how your players look. Although limited but it's something cool to run around with a cowboy hat and all your players looking -_- like this. Weeee!Animation is fluid, no choppy performance issue but the music after XX hours I couldn't take it anymore. I switched it off and played my own mp3 list. It was a much more rewarding experience when you are listening to “ice ice baby” while leading 50-3. you know?My Personal ThoughtsLast steam sale, I wanted to purchase a similar product within this context of genre@gameplay. Something just for the fun & casual however I skip it. This time around, I went for it. Looking at the blue mini characters that goes “Weeee” when you blow them up to the sky...I dont know. Satisfying in some sense? Sending hordes of cows onto the pitch, deploying cannons that scores goals for you, sending off the entire team or converting your players into Spartan warriors. Epic. Tons of laughter & fun.There's 2 issue arising from the game by the time you completed your second planet.Things are no longer funnyYou are basically picking up skill set to counter your opponent's skill set or most of the time or  you practically send off the entire team 90% of the game. Across 4 planets.The Darn objectivesIn my opinion, the objective is the biggest flaw of the game. It comes as a double edge sword. While it gives player challenges to utilize different strategy from each game, it hampers the fun. All of a sudden, you feel as if you are restricted and no longer have freedom to cause mayhem.Apart from that, If you are trying to obtain 100% achievement, you will hate the objective system as it is built to annoy the crap out of you. You're here to have fun, why can't I win all the matches? Why must my team lose? Why must I follow the score line at half time? Why are you restricting me now?! WHY????????I didn't enjoy my game anymore once I was at third planet as the objective was killing my fun moment and I want to get 100% achievement but I doubt I will be able to do it now considering the oponent@AI has so many skill set available to them. You wont be able to meet the objectives with all this mess thrown at you. /sadMy SummaryFootLoL is certainly fun and refreshing to play with friends/with others but I doubt it can keep it's player base in the long run. I just wished there was a little more to do/or to see as I traveled to other planets. But everywhere I go, I lay waste. Lol.I am not sure if the opponent strategy was well thought off or just randomly assigned. Some of them are in a mess. You can't counter mess with more mess. You can only delay or hinder the mess from becoming a bigger mess for your team. Did my sentence make any sense to you? No? I can assure you that I am still sane at this point of writing.Due to that, if you are playing this product just for the fun and don't focus on the objectives at all. You'll be riding cows on UFOS. If your emphasis is on objectives, the cows will be riding you on UFO's instead. Without further delay, before I start to sound like an insane person, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for FootLOL: Epic Fail League is an EPIC 5/10.*weeeeee*"

Skills range from simple things such as the infamous red card to strategic bombardment and UFO's.Obviously some combinations are more unbalanced than others, ban all enemies from the field, summon some fans and drop a few extra balls to get as many goals as you want....which actually isn't helpful, since the game gives you a few objectives for extra in-game cash, and they're all ""reach a score of X:Y"", and you have to wait for the enemy to score the points you need really slowly, kind of like watching a bull ♥♥♥♥ your wife for those in the know (I'm sure there are many in the gaming community).The length is abysmal, after the tournament/campain mode, which lasts 4 hours (a bit more if you want to reach the random score every time), you don't have many choices.You could try getting the few achievements that are left, and that will take 20 minutes at best, but then what?The multiplayer is deserted, custom mode offers no challenge, and you've gone through the campaign already.A bit like fastfood, amusing for a while, but little value outside of that, FootLOL sets no miraculous goals in front of itself, but that kitsch nature unsettles more than attempts at grandeur.Still a thumbs up because turning your players into spartans and summoning gatling cannons is something I always wanted to do in a football game."
