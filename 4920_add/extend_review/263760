I adored the first one ""Stair dismount"" and this one is even better than the first one being with cars! I do love fast cars and all that, and this game is perfect for having fun and laughing when you see all the accidents. You can also costumize your character being able to place a face of someone you hate and you can also add any car logo you want, like i chose Bugatti :D. Love this game and i'm looking forward to new updates! Have fun playing it yourselves!"

This is one of those games that you can pick up very easily and its simple, mindless fun. There is no goal to Turbo Dismount, you kinda just set up a level and watch the carnage. With many customizable options, you can choose how Mr.Dismount explodes or gets beheaded... IN STYLE! If you have a very specific kind of humor and wouldn't find a lifeless body being torn apart and vehicles being ripped apart entertaining (there is no blood in this game as a side note), then this game isn't for you. If you are thinking about buying it and it looks like your cup of tea, go for it! If your looking for a story or an adventure, look elsewhere, because this is the epitome of stupid fun!"
,Recommended,263760,10941419,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Otter Chaos,"Ah, Tubo Dismount.  The name alone conjures up images of, well, your mom, actually, but this is not the time or the place for that particular tale.Anyway, Turbo Dismount is the heartbreaking story of Joe Dismount.  A man trapped in a world that seems to want nothing more than to push him down each time he tries to rise, and hobble him every time he tries to walk.  It's a familiar scene, the cycle of repression which seems torn straight from today's geopolitical headlines.As painful as it is to watch Joe's agonizing struggles, and I must admit it brought a tear to my eye more than once, we have to face the fact that Joe is not entirely a blameless victim here.  Joe appears to be actively seeking his own demise, and every time we see him dangling from the back of a speeding sports car, or rolling off of a cliff in an office chair, we can only wonder what horrors Joe has seen, or dare I say, even participated in, that drive this insatiable lust for the sweet release of death.We may never know, for as simple as Turbo Dismount may appear on the surface, beneath lies a complex web of tortured emotion and dark secrets best left undisturbed.  Some may view Joe as a hero, others may see him as a villan, but where Turbo Dismount succeeds in uniting us, is that we can all see Joe torn into little pieces strewn across a highway in the middle of a twenty vehicle pileup.  I suppose that in the end, that's all that really matters."

Then I saw it on steam, then it ended up in my possession.Turbo Dismount is a simple physics sandbox in where your character clings in humorous and non-safe ways onto vehicals and ploughs into traffic.  Really simple.  The crashes and the ammount of damage is a wonder to behold as you see Mr. (Or Mrs.) Dismount roll under cars and loose limbs and break bones.  The Game also has a replay function where you can slow, rewind and fast foward time so you can see that perfect bone crunching angle.  Also you can dot your path to traffic with Turbo Pads, or Speed Bumps, or Half-pipes or mines for the extra 'umph'.Levels are rather small but they do their job, and you have quite a selection of vehicals and poses, and when you are bored of what the developers made there is a host of steam workshop levels for you to play with aswell.And one level of praise I will give the developers, is customization, you can plaster your face, or someone you like (Or really hate) to the puppet Mr (Or Mrs.) Dismount, and you can attach a logo to your vehicals aswell.It's simple, it's fun, it's cheap, you should own this."

,Recommended,263760,14532354,"Posted: 18 February, 2015",all,bobert awful (F+),"Turbo Dismount is a game where the little guy falls out of the car and then the car runs him over. Turbo Dismount is where the little guy pedals his tricycle off of a cliff and down five stories onto landmines which launch him up into the air. Turbo Dismount is where the little guy does a loop-de-loop on a section of road and drives straight into a patch of landmines at top speed, making him and his car explode rather spectacularly. Turbo Dismount is where a guy gets into a drag race and finishes it by plowing his car into a wall.I could tell you about a hundred of these stories, but it's basically a guy, a car, and a set of circumstances in which you have to figure out how to inflict maximum pain on the guy, and the punchline involves grevious bodily harm.It's a joke you can re-experience and re-tool over and over, but the punchline itself starts to get stale around four hours after you've played out all the variations of ""What happens when an (adjective) (character) in a (type of car) drives into a (insert hazard here)?"". It's a bit like Mad Libs, but with physics and objects.I don't see myself playing this again anytime soon, but the time I did spend with it was hilarious, and there's a level based off of the Springfield Gorge scene from an early Simpsons episode called ""Bart The Daredevil"". So there's your recommendation."

It was one of the best time-wasters I had ever played, and Turbo Dismount, the sequel that I never even fathomed would be made, is even better than the prequel. You have a selection of quite a few different vehicles, from a monster truck to a skateboard to a red Angry Bird to a fire truck and everything in between. You also have different poses to choose from specific to each vehicle. You choose the map, speed, and GET ♥♥♥♥ING WRECKED by whatever you run into. It could be traffic, a brick wall, landmines, or scenery. It's so fun to see your little dude get mauled by everything in sight. That sounds messed up and quite gruesome, but there is no blood or gore in the game, however, there IS dismemberment, and I'm pretty sure that someone in the future will find a way to make a bloody mod for the game. The physics are well-done in some parts and downright hilarious in others, like when you run into traffic, and then there's a pileup and cars go flying everywhere. If there is one questionable thing I have to say about physics, it's how the guy, if he gets flung into the air, he will slowly stop spinning while in the air. This defies physics and just bugs me a bit for some reason I don't understand. There are also modded levels you can make for the game, which gives the fans something to do to contribute to the game. All in all, this is a time-waster worth the money. It's fun and hilarious and the modding community is very creative. Final Score: 8.75/10."

I was the same way at one point. Take my advice: just watch those videos some more. They're way more fun than the actual game.The objective of Turbo Dismount is to orchestrate vehicular accidents that cause as much damage as possible to your vehicle and the hapless mannequin forced into this dilemma. You have at your disposal various maps, vehicles, obstacles to litter the course with, and poses for your mannequin. If you've seen any of the aforementioned YouTube videos, you're no doubt aware of the sort of destruction that can ensue. This would be all fine and dandy if it actually felt like the player had any real control over the outcomes of these crashes.Accelerating the vehicle consists of holding down a button and releasing it at the moment when a meter is at the desired level. Because of how obscenely quickly the meter fills up and then empties again, precise timing is nearly impossible. This is compunded by the vehicles' tendency to do whatever they want to, such as letting up on the gas when you want them to speed up, vice versa. Many of the obstacles frequently fail to produce an intended effect, and sometimes fail to produce any effect at all. Even in levels that involve other traffic, those other vehicles appear in random order and speed by so quickly that it's nigh impossible to properly time a collision.The physics engine is capable, but unpredictable. A satisfying crash can have vehicle and body parts being strewn about and colliding with each other in amusing ways, but these moments are scarce thanks to the physics' refusal to behave consistently. It's also frustrating how your ragdolling mannequin often struggles to maintain its pose, or even stay attached to the vehicle, in order to have it hit something in a desired manner.All of these frustrations combine to form an experience that is usually comprised of restarting a level over and over and over again to get a desired result. When a beautiful catastrophe does happen, it tends to feel less like the results of the player's planning and effort, and more like the result of unintentional happenstance. Even if the player learns the mechanics and nuances well enough to consistently create satisfying crashes, what's left at that point is just a shallow, one-note time waster. Ragdoll crashes car. Ragdoll goes ragdolling. Oh, how the lolz are killing me.Turbo Dismount is a one-trick pony that ♥♥♥♥s up its one trick nine times out of ten. It may be worth getting if you have some easily amused eight-year-old children in your home who are in need of a distraction. Maybe you're into the sort of boring Sunday afternoon that's reminiscent of tossing about Legos in a feeble effort to create imaginary explosions. Otherwise, don't bother."

,Recommended,263760,10213701,"Posted: 23 May, 2014",all,john,"The premise of this game is kinda dumb and I wasn't so sure about it. However, it became side-splitting fun very quickly.  Say what you will about any game but if it can literally make me laugh out loud them I'm going to like it. Games like Deadpool, for example, have this same quality.  Basically what you're doing is setting up one of your two customizable characters in a sandbox track type environment for various ways to do serious bodily harm to them.  Its basically like when you were a little kid and would set up a toy soldier on a little obstacle course with cars, explosions, and all of that sort of thing except it is virtual and freeking hilarious.  I've also heard this called a crash test dummy sim and I suppose that is fair too.  All I know is I think other people with a childish sense of humor like mine who like games will probably enjoy Turbo Dismount.  The gamer chooses a course, sets up some obstacles, picks a mode of transportation (cars, bikes, skateboard, etc) a customizable Mr or Ms Dismount character, and the position on the vehicle for the character, then sends them on the way to certain death.  Once the dismount is achieved the whole scenario can be rewound and played back at various speeds to your liking either for your own entertainment or to help decide how to tweak the course.  Everything in the game seems well done.  I haven't encountered anything to complain about.  The graphics are simple but highly adequate and the camera system is great.  If I had to complain about any one thing is that I'd like to see more obstacles and perhaps a user picked starting point.  Its not a big deal and perhaps is something left for the next version.  I'm not much of a multi-player type of person for the most part but I can see where this would be fun to play with someone else."

,Recommended,263760,20736098,"Posted: 24 January, 2016",all,InfernoLizard64,"INTRODUCTIONTurbo dismount is a game I've put a lot of time into. The graphics are great, the possibilities are nearly infinite, and the workshop has thousands of levels. If you want to get the game, yet you are still slightly skeptical, here's my review on Turbo Dismount.STORYOh, story. Yeah, this game has none! The most a completionist can do is play all the pre-made levels and get all the achievements, which will still take around 20-30 hours. The point of Turbo dismount is to mess around with what you got. I've (so far) put around 27 hours into the game and I still can't get enough of the game.FEATURESThe game comes with some levels to mess around in, but you can always download levels from the steam workshop if you get tired of those levels. You can choose several vehicles, which are all unique in their own way. There's a Tricycle, Fire truck, Wrecking ball, Skateboard, Sports car, etc. If you are wondering, you can choose different characters that can pose and be customized. One of my friends had fun putting the face of Donald Trump on his character, then he would do whatever he wanted to. For poses, there's tons of them, exclusive to each character. Yes, you can do a Miley Cyrus pose on the wrecking ball, and you can do poses on the Wastelander (Inspired by the Mad Max films) that are related to the movies. There's also obstacles you can place down such as a speed boost pad and ramps.GAMEPLAYAfter choosing your character, vehicle, pose, and obstacles, you have to hold down [SPACE BAR] to adjust speed. It's a frustrating task because if you release it at the wrong time, you can go really slow, or way to fast for you to comprehend.  I can still use turbo pads to go fast though, because I usually want to go fast. Characters can have their bones broken, dismembered, twisted the opposite direction, etc, and makes the game more interesting. The physics engine is not realistic though. Once I was using a skateboard and my head got blown off from a wooden paddle when I was only going around a smooth 20 mph ( around 32 kph for foreigners).AUDIOThe SFX is clear and more realistic than the physics engine. The sounds bones crushing and muscles tearing is what gets me. I probably wouldn't have laughed at this game if SFX and the music weren't there. The music is a jazzy rhythm, and makes the game seem like an overly-edited fail compalation that you can control.PLAYABILITYThe game has barely any glitches, and recieves laughs from anybody who watches it or plays it. It has the perfect blend of humor and control of paths that I like. This is a must play when my friends come over, and we end up putting 1 or 2 hours of into it everytime. We can laugh at the insanity that happens before our eyes when our character gets blown up by a mine and afterwords mauled by a snow plow. If your mind is thinking ""Why would you laugh at that, ONLY SADISTIC MINDFREAKS WOULD LAUGH AT THAT!"", well I have a claim. Your so called ""character"" is a test dummy, and the game is only a simulation. Also you would be calling Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, Pewdiepie, Kwebblelkop, Ssunde, Ihascupquake, and DanTDM sadistic mindfreaks ( If you don't know who they are, look them up on a trusty site I call Youtube).SUM UP:DO I RECCOMEND THIS GAME?I reccomend this game to a certain crowd. If you are easlily offended, than no. Despite a couple cons, it's definitely the most fun I've had destroyng stuff on my PC (Just Cause 3 is on my XBOX One, so I'm specifying to PC), and is no doubt, a ""kinetic tragedy""(that's the games slogan)My rating? 8.25 out of 10. You can play it with friends, family, yourself, and can see what sort of crazy things the community has done because I forgot to mention that you can upload gifsBy, InfernoLizard64"

I saw this and I thought for such a little price I could not lose. I chose well. This is an exellent game. This is a game I feel that Michelle Obama would like this game because it does not have any fat children in it.EDIT: Now for a real review of the game since it has now gone beta. If you liked the first two games you will enjoy this one very much. There are many levels to play and objects to place for the wide assortment of vehicles to crash into. Good old Mr. Dismount is back and you can smash and dismember him to your hearts content. There is a Workshop with many excellent user -made levels and a level editor (you download the components seperately). The leaderboards are fun to pursue and the community seems quite decent. Updates come fairly regularly and they usually include some new item like a new level or vehicle or obstacle. Also, you can customize your character with a face or bobblehead of your choice and make a custom logo for the vehicles. The game is tight, the physics can be a real riot sometimes but all in all it just adds to the game. I have never had a game crash or any other issues with it, though MacIntosh users seem to have the most problems so take that for what it is worth. The Devs even respond on the board quitye often so for $9.00 USD  (as of this writing) you are getting your value and then some."

,Recommended,263760,11964367,"Posted: 2 September, 2014",all,donia <3<3,"Is this a good, playable, and enjoyable game? YesHowever, it is not worth the $10 pricetag unless you can easily spare this money. I bought this game on sale for $4, and I feel this is a fair price for the game. Why?With the steam workshop, you will probably get around 5 hours at max on this game, and this is the sole reason the game is not worth the $10 in my opinion. It has a degree of replayability, but you'd eventually get tired of the same track your car follows, the same amount and place of obstacles, and the small maps.The crash physics are mediocre, and if you want an automobile game with great and realistic crash physics along with a decent amount of mods and replayability I'd reccomend beamNG drive. This game's physics are more fictional and cartoony, but this isn't a downside, rather a different concept.To the developers (What I think needs to be improved to make this game worth the full price):- Ability to drive custom paths- Ability to mod custom models, veichles and veichle properties, obstacles, and physics- More detailed and textured models, add aesthetical variety to the different maps- Add the ability to place unlimited obstacles wherever, not constrained to certain spots.- Larger maps not constrained by an invisible box but instead more aesthetical pleasing walls/mountains/ect.Again, the theme and concept of this game isn't bad but indeed ""cartoony"" and unique but it needs more features to lengthen it's replayability and add some elements of sandbox.

Unlike PAIN, however, I found Turbo Dismount more entertaining.PAIN had optional objectives that you could complete at any time to unlock a few things here and there, but any sort of objective or unlock system makes screwing around feel kinda weird and almost unenjoyable. You feel like you're not accomplishing anything, and there are things that you might want but you won't get by messing around. PAIN also had an immature sense of humor (using a donut shop to make♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes? Seriously?) that just turns me away for some reason.Turbo Dismount on the other hand, has no objectives or unlockables. In other kinds of games, this would be a VERY BAD THING. But in a game like this, it works really well for some reason. Choose a level, select a vehicle, and hit the accelerator. And hocus pocus, just like that, you've caused a major traffic pileup (you jerk).Another great part of Turbo Dismount is how smooth the replay system is. The replay system in PAIN is oddly awkward to use for some reason, but Turbo dismount somehow gets it incredibly right by giving you no controls other than playback speed and camera movement.Turbo Dismount also features dismemberment (that is not at all gory, because the characters are pretty much just crash test dummies), which makes everything SO much more satisfying. You'll find out what I mean when you ask yourself ""wait, what happened to his head, and where's one of his arms?"" then you realize that you have no idea when he lost his head/arm, and you don't know where they went. And that all works really well with the replay system, because you can find out what happened to said head/arm.Turbo Dismount is just a fun little game to waste time on.Another thing: this is just a more interesting version of Stair Dismount, which you can grab for your smartphone. But this one is WAY better."

,Recommended,263760,20569876,"Posted: 16 January, 2016",all,Fluffyrox4,"Turbo dismount has a simple concept. Crash.Ok let me get straight in. Turbo dismount is a game where a rag doll is put in a car, and then the car crashes. The immense variety of everything in this game may make this review a bit tedious, but bear with me.Let's touch on the gameplay. You dismount your vehicle by holding down a button on the screen that says ""dismount"", and you release it when it fills up to your liking. The more filled the button is, the faster your viechles will go.Now that we've done that, let's talk about the vehicles. The amount of cars and other things to ride is pretty huge, and each vehicle has different acceleration, speed and weight. Because of how many there are, we can't cover them all, but I'll try to cover a good variety. The squealer is the fastest vehicle in the game, and basically resembles a F1 racing car, it's downside is that it is not very durable, and will sometimes fall apart because of how fast it is going. The red hot engine is a fire truck with a crane arm on top, and most dummies can sit in this. This vehicle, along with the wrecking ball and the bulldozer, is the strongest viechle in the game, and only has a few breaking points, the downside of this vehicle and the other two I just touched on, is that they are not very fast. The last vehicle I'll look at is the boss throne, which is a swivel chair. That's all it is. Along with the tricycle and skateboard, these vehicles are quite slow, and because of how small they are, don't break.Now we've looked at a few of the vehicles, let's touch on the characters. Each character is different in size, has a different name, and has different poses. Mr. Dismount is the main character, and Ms. Dismount is basically a female version of Mr. Dismount. Mr. Ego has a big head and looks depressed most of the time, Mr. Heft is a chubby man who has some more daring poses, Mr. Reach is a skinny guy with long limbs, Ms. Bumblebee is a big bummed woman, and  finally, Ms. Diva is a fat model. These characters can even be customized from the main menu to have a picture on where their face should be, or make a bobble head, which is hard to explain, just look it up. The vehicle can also be customized to have a logo on them.Now, we look at the levels. Each level is different from the rest, and because there are some many, I can only cover a few. Hit the fan is a level where you start on a road, and drive into a big area full of wind turbines, and by adding a ramp at the start, you can literally hit the fan. Space program is an interesting level. It's basically a huge vertical wall that you can try to drive a car up. Can you get to the top? Lets keep going is a level that is a rocky cliff. Have fun! The last level I will touch on is Run DMZ. It's a road that is surrounded my a minefield. You can drive into it! There is also a huge steam community for this game, and there are tons more workshop levels for you to download!The final thing I need to touch on is the obstacles. These can be placed in levels and moved around, and add a lot of variety to your crashes. Some include; road bumps, mines, traffic cones, bowling pins, ramps, boost pads, brake pads, roadblocks, breakable brick walls, invincible mega walls and an oilslick.Did you make it this far? If you didn't I don't blame you, but if you like endless replayability, lots of laughs, and exploding dummies, you WILL love this game.My final rating is... 9/10"

Although I feel the price is a bit high, the more content it gets the more it will be worth, and I anticipate the price to equal the content very soon. It is a ragdoll physics game where you aim your cars with your ragdoll inside towards various dangers, some of which you control. You choose some of the obstacles, the speed and the direction, but you CANNOT steer the cars. I was put off by that because I expected to be able to, but I was quite satisfied regardless. The map veriety is excellent already as is the selection of cars and obstacles.Pros:-Good content and veriety. More to come.-Fun and entertaining-good FPS and graphicsCons:-Scoreboard glitches, forget's your score/doesn't count it.-Inability to control the car or person's movements after dismount begins.Advice for developers: I would propose something akin to the ""Burnout"" series method of slightly affecting your player's movements after the crash. Otherwise, keep the new content coming and great job so far!"

I don't believe i ave the power to convince another to do something else, and as many other people like this game i believe my opinion wont change anything.I don't think its a terrible game. I just feel like its an acquired taste that many people have, but some don't, and thats me. Its fun wore out fast for me, and I didnt like the need to install fanmade content to have more fun.In conclusion, it's not a terrible game but for some people its fun can wear out fast.

So, it's not really anything like HappyWheels, which is a disappointment.The meat of the game is picking obstacles to put on the map, pick a vehicle, and determine how fast it will go on it's imaginary rail. So, from an interaction standpoint, it's actually a bit dull.But the reason I've put a few hours into this is that the physics engine is really good (aside from the cars that make up CPU traffic weighing about 5kg's each), and the rag-doll mechanic is consistently funny in at least a minor way. Plus, it's what I'd call a 60-second game: you can play it in the few minutes extra you have between being ready for work and actually having to leave. Really, it's a good way to get a chuckle if you are running ahead of your schedule and have a few minutes. It's the sort of game you can enjoy without needing more than a minute, unlike many games, and it's cheap enough that the lack of depth isn't a problem.But only if you can get past the lack of interaction. The spectacle is fun, and there's enough options and choices to set-up your crashes and jumps for the vehicles, but my recommendation is only a marginal thumbs-up since there's no actual driving and the spectacle is only going to get you so far.Again, you can't actually drive the vehicles, and the level of interaction is very low besides just choosing a car, speed, maps, and placing a couple obstacles.But it's worth it for a game to have when you just want to have a laugh in the minute or two before having to do something else.(FINAL NOTE: Around 10 of my hours were gained because of forgetting the game was on after I went to bed. As I said before, it's not something you'd expect to put much time into, but the time does add up if you mess around 5 minutes here or there during a work-week or school week. Really, I think I'm at actually a little over a dozen hours)."

As the player you have to well, drive the cars/bikes/vans/quads/buses/birds that love you. Yes. Cars can love you. So get in love with a Golf R.Maps: 9.75/10This section could recieve 10 if the Workshop had a map for 420,069,666,360 points. When playing Turbo Dismount, play the map called ""Keep On Going"" or ""Highway"", as these can give you 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 points respectively.Price: 9.75/10This section could recieve 10 if the price wasn't in the same league as the more popular Garry's Mod and Undertale.

BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS GAME GETS OLD SO SO FAST! For the price it's not worth it.In-depth review:Turbo Dismount is a game about crashing. You may think that watching crash test videos on YouTube will never get boring, I agree with you. But Turbo Dismount wont give you the same emotions. The game doesn't have soft body physics, is really arcady, unrealistic and is kind of weird (in a bad way). I have to agree that watching Mr. Dismount (the ragdoll) can SOMETIMES be ridiculously funny, but this happens only very very rarily. Another reason I don't like this game is that there isn't a goal to achieve. You may say that there is: getting to #1 place on the leaderbords. This goal is achievable but it's ridiculously hard, almost imposibble (I'm 99% sure that all the best scores are achieved by glithces). What makes this game really bad, is that theres a lack of contenct. I know that developers try to make this game as fun as possible by adding new content like new maps, cars, ragdolls, obsticles... but they don't really make a difference. If only this game was a cheaper it would be worth to buy (When I buyed it the price was 4 dollars). This game will be fun for a few days or weeks, but than it gets really old..."

Sure, there are limitless ways you can crash your vehicle and accumulate a higher and higher score, but it all boils down to what Turbo Dismount relied on in the first place to gain it's popularity, the content creators from YouTube, they stopped playing as a result from the game's novelty just wearing off on them.However, I digress, I would not recommend Turbo Dismount as players will begin to realize that they spent $9-$10 on a game that relied on novelty and hype generated by YouTube as I had.

That's where the game falls sure there are maps and diffrent setups you can do on maps, but it just want's to tell you/us the same joke over and over again.Trust me not worth your time, get someting that will keep you entertained for a longer period of time."

In fact, there are quite a few good things about it - the degree to which you can experiment with the numerous obstacles and veichles to get different outcomes can be impressive and the courses themselves well-designed, encouraging maximum destruction and crazy hijinks all throughout. Workshop intergration is well-done, with a bunch of user-created levels to play around in, and of course there is always a good laugh to be had from a crash dummy getting as screwed up as possible.But the fact of the matter is that it's nowhere near as interesting to crash a car for the 100th time as it is to crash it for the first. After about 3 hours of play, I grew incredibly and extremely bored with the repetition of crashing, the bland style of the game, and with the lack of variety overall. After a while, it starts to all feel like 'same old, same old' - just the same freaking thing over and over again throughout and throughout without much difference. Even the Workshop levels (which tend to blow things up the absolute extreme) can't stop the monotony from breaking through.You might like this game a lot more than I did. You might find the game's explosive antics a lot more amusing than I ever would. You might be crashing cars way more times than I could ever bear. But for me, this game is nothing more - and nothing less - than what it is: a virtual way to crash cars. Over and over and over and over and over again.5.4 / 10"

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets.- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest.- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates.Serve it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

You pick a vehicle (of which there is certainly a fair variety as far as looks, but no real differences besides small/big/fast/slow), click a button, and watch the vehicle crash into obstacles. That's it. You can even play almost the exact same thing on the developer's website for FREE.It is well made, looks and sounds great, and seems to have an active Workshop community.

You smash stuff,  destroy yourself and your car, and you do it in a funny way that makes you laugh. Other than a wide-ish selection of cars, which you cant make or customize, and the obsticals you could put in the trap, there really isnt a lot of oppertunity in this game. I know a good game, this you get bored of it in the first ten minutes of the game. YOU CALL THAT GOOD?! The only reason people keep buying this game and thinking its good is because of the youtubers point of view when playing this game. It sucks when you control with the wheel because its hard to maneuver, when you play all the stages your gonna go like ""What now?"" and just quit because your bored of the game. The game is bad! I HIGHLY do not recommend this game."

It's poorly optimized and if I try to run it, the whole room starts heating up and I am forced to close it from discomfort. There's not much variety here, because it's just you setting up a scenario, viewing what happens, and that's it. The only things you control are the vehicles, positions, obstacles, and paths. 17 times out of 20, nothing happens, and when something happens you get really bored of it very quickly, because the guys head flew off or a truck hit him, but there's nothing other than dismemberment and your vehicle getting broken into parts. Everything else is unbreakable, and it's just like a bunch of blocks."

,Not Recommended,263760,13672623,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,Tyltyl,"Less funny than it looks like. Basically you get a bunch of tracks, vehicles, characters and obstacles to cause accidents. You have less control than it seems, you can place objects only where the game allows you to.Basically you have to push a button and let the vehicle crash into random stuff, far from being interactive.The physics it's far from perfects, every vehicles (especially the NPC ones) are mostly made of rubber and don't even get wrecked. The ragdoll effect is acceptable, but I've seen better. I don't see the point of having different characters and motorbikes if they can't ride them for more than a few seconds and barely reach the obstacles you have placed. Every other vehicle is mostly useless, ranging from huge, slow and totally unfunny to see crashing to intolerbly fast cars, seeing them crashing after a second from start. Also most of the time your character will fall out of the vehicle before crashing anywhere, thus ending the session very early.Other than that, you have to follow some predetermined steering paths which the vehicles can't even follow correctly. You have manual steering but it doesn't make the game any funnier.The default cameras are placed very badly, not letting you see anything. You have to use the manual one which is barely good depending on how you can handle it.It could have been a good idea, but it's very badly developed. I would rather wait for a fully functional BeamNG."

I'm looking forward to more and better levels as less than half of the ten or so levels are any fun.I'm hoping that the developers include environmental effects like wind or rushing water. Even levels of an outdoorsy type or rural setting would be a good varation from the strictly urban-style-only levels.

A nice variety of pre-made maps comes with the game, but luckily enough there is a Workshop available for Turbo Dismount, meaning a constant stream of player-built maps are available (some really good ones are already out and make the game even more gruesomely fun!).Players are able to pick from a variety of vehicles, then edit certain points of the current map with obstacles, or ramps and nitro pads. Depending on what vehicle you choose, you can also choose what position and pose your character is in. Following this, you choose the direction you want your vehicle to travel in.This combination causes for insane results, quite entertaining as an Early Access Game.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the previous Dismount games, or want to get into them."

The game has a simple concept but the real meat of it is the charm it has. If throwing a ragdoll into a road with high speed, remorseless vehicles isn't fun enough for you, then you can put a stupid picture on the ragdoll's head and the fun never stops!However, the game is slightly let down by how limited the customization is; there is no included level editor.

Made buy guys who are very experienced with the dismount style physics games, and they've made Stair Dismount, a somewhat similar one for iOS. I didn't realize they were one and the same, the dev, but it's refreshing to know that his game would be good from the starting logo. It's intuitive with a lot of custimization, first person camera, vehicle cam, dismemberment, breakable cars and trees, traffic, changeable driving paths, placement of objects and  3+ different poses for each vehicle that are all bound so if you sit on the side of the back of a monster truck, you won't just slide off. Fun levels, and a lot of variety for a small early access game. If you like physics games and simulators, like Algodoo (Phun), then this is a must buy for you. It's also a really great game to get while you're waiting for BeamNG and The Next Car Game, but you should play this after they're released too."

It can be pretty entertaining for a few hours and it has a good physics engine, but what you see is what you get. A game involving humourous crashes and colliisions and if you may get bored over time. At least later you can experience more from it when updates appear with new vehicles and other content.Such as the Boogie Bus where it bounces slightly and a pose where the (Mr/Mrs) Dismount Dummy does a dance on top of the bus. Or an office chair where you move at slow speeds at traffic or walls.All around this is a great game and quite silly, but at least with the new updates it keeps this being fresh and not being overused such as Goat Simulator."

Sometimes, the physics can get rather wonky and the result is a hilarious car-crash that will make you laugh so hard you'll forget that Mr. Dismount has unfortunately become Mr. Dismember, for your own entertainment.  There's a multitude of maps, vehicles, and characters to choose from, and there's also community-created maps.Does the game have a point? Well, maybe not, but it's silly and simple fun that you can have when you're bored and/or you're feeling sadistic today.

Half the fun of Truck Dismount was swapping replay files with my friends and then we'd all watch them and be like oh man ha ha! Not so much now. Enjoy that catastrophic wreck you just caused now, because once you leave the replay, it's gone forever.All that said, this is what it's supposed to be: a pretty darn fun way to kill a few minutes.

Although if you want to get this game wait for it to go on sale like during summer or Christmas. I got it for $3 when it was on sale. It's fun to play levels from the Steam Workshop. Some of you might say it's not worth to buy this game because it's free on the app store. But on the Steam version you get all  the vehicles and levels (and Steam Workshop) but on the app store you need to pay separately  for the levels and vehicles. I would rate this game a 8/10. If you want you can buy the game now for like $10 or just wait for it to go on sale. If you want to buy this game  I recommend you to buy it but that is your choice. Also the developers of the game should really add in A TANK. No I mean they should really add one. That would be AWESOME.

This is a truly HILARIOUS game, and it is worth $9.99. If it was $30, I would still buy it if I knew how fun it was."

(You can by the way). I've only just bought this and started to play but already I'm grinning and laughing like a fool, it's a very rare game that can get me to do that and I haven't even tried anyone of the workshop stuff yet.

So when you start playing for about 2 hours your gonna be as board as an orc at a social event. So here's how you make the game more fun, you go into the games customizing, and take a funny picture of your face and put it on the dummy. it makes it so much funnier and you'll cringe every time you see your beautiful self get smashed into pieces by other FTL cars, yes for some reason everybody on steam workshop thinks cars move faster than light and its both ridiculous and funny to play around with. this is a game to just sit down with your friends and do stupid stuff.Now i have to warn anyone who is interested. It is easy to loose interest in this game, what you see in pics and videos is really all you can do. a few months ago they added manual steering which is awesome, but again it will drag. so only by if you really just want a nice relaxing game that you don't really need a large attention span for. i seriously play this when watching tv.Is it worth $9.99? well that's a matter of opinion. if you'd ask me, its cheap, the developers could have been jerks and tried charging you $14.99 or more. i recommend this game for anyone who loves hanging with their friends and family, its a great game to see who can go the farthest, loose the most body parts, or who can go the longest without cringing their face in horrid starring.Its also a great game to show to your friends who have drinking problems, trust me, it'll make em stop.
