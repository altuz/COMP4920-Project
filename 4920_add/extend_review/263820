As for the plot, it is amusing and it is nice to play as the villain for a change. It does get overly repeditive to always play the heroes in this sort of genre so I consider it a breath of fresh air overall.For a mere 2 bucks, this game is one of the best deals for fans of the classic action/rpg's from the days of old.Well done, well done."

If you like retro, you will like this, it stays true to the classics of old.3. Interesting story: you play as a ruthless, evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It has some funny moments but also some engagingly bleak ones, do not expect to be a good guy for one second.4. A final boss the way a final boss should be... beware.Cons:1. Combat can sometimes feel repetitive, you may also feel like the only real challenge comes from bosses unless you are reckless.2. Game sometimes feels 'barebones' in respect to itemisation and some areas are repeated with different textures.Tip:I recommend playing on hard from the start, I never tried normal but hard seemed just right.In summary:Buy this game. It was a blast, it gave me a solid 7 hours of entertainment, and will probably give you more if you want to collect all the achievements."

Nice! :DNow the gameplay and AI is a little clumsy so you will see some odd movement and action response from your attackers but it does not ruin the game experience.This game really is a lot of fun if you are into retro Action RPGs. :)A game like this I would have easily thought would be $4.99 USD but for the price offered for $1.99 USD, it's a steal for the quality and great story offered in this game.Go and buy yourself a copy. You won't be dissappointed. :)"

Now to the game, ill drop it in sections to make it easier.Gameplay:I was very surprised, im normally not a fan of these kinds of games but the combat was very precise and quick, a easy to do hard to master kind of deal. The RPG side of it i was confronted was oddly simple yet deep enough for me to quickly realise the difference in how i could build a character, it allowed me from the start to know what i wanted to build and how to play with next to no hand holding, i was impressed. Just to squeeze in something i also enjoyed, the boss battles, they actually had mechanics to them that wasnt just walking around and dodging, it added a little more difficulty to the battles and made them more interesting.Story:The story was quite intriguing, you play the opposite side of the way these storys would normally go, from the evil perspective and how overwhelming that evil is, i actually had alot of fun playing from this side. The story itself is nothing to special but interesting enough to carry you along the path of becoming stronger and beating bosses.Sound:Its sound was not terrible but i admit i kinda got sick of it half way through the game, but it is fitting with the game and i enjoyed it up to that point, its kinda a mix of dark upbeat, very much suits the mood of the game.Conclusion:Im very happy with this purchase, even at this price point, it delivered on everything i expected and didnt expect, this is a gem for the price that it is set for, and if your into these kinds of games and looking to kill a little bit of time, definantly dont skip over this."

The story was humorous with just enough length to leave you wanting a bit more but not feeling burned once you've reached the end. The graphics and mechanics were beautifully done and respond nicely. Was really happy to see how easily it worked with the Xbox 360 wired controller on PC. Simple plug and play with matching graphics on the UI when using controller.The retro feeling captured in the game was great. Everything from the graphics to the sounds and score. If you're a fan of the older action rpgs for nes/snes then you'll easily find your money's worth in this game. Speaking of money's worth the pricing was excellent in my opinion. Anywho, try the game out - it's good."
,Recommended,263820,13014550,"Posted: 20 November, 2014",all,Tom,"Evil Quest was a purchase I made not expecting too much from it, however after just completing it, it was well worth the ride. It's a nice change to play as the bad guy and want to take over and destroy the world for once. This classic SNES type RPG game did everything right for me. It doesn't take itself too seriously, I mean, c'mon,  you have to kill God....Towards the end of the game, I pretty much ripped through any enemies in one shot, you can collect some pretty overpowered spells, and if you are like me, and stacked Intellect to get a higher mana pool, you could simply AOE through most zones, mopping up the experiance as you went.The game is actually pretty simple. As long as you read the story, you won't find yourself wondering where to go next as it is quite clearly set out for you. There isn't any side quests to complete, however there are a number of achivements you work towards.I would highly recommend this game if you are looking for something a little different and only want to spend £1,60, you can't go wrong with this five hour long title."

,Not Recommended,263820,23966503,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,@DrCplBritish,"Now EvilQuest is a game that on the surface, people would love.Why?It's cheap, looks nice for a pixel game and has some decent evil humour in it.Annnnd thats where the good points for me end.I booted up the game and first of all realized you're stuck with 1280x720 or 640x480, not really an issue for me but I thought I would mention it on here. Good news is that controls are rebindable! I would highly recommend this because the default controls are a bit clunky and take some getting used to.My main issue with this game is mostly the combat. The combat in this game feels very... clunky - enemies will hit you and damage you before they've finished their swinging animation, they will instantly change direction mid animation to hit you so don't think that because that big brute is swinging left he won't hit you instantly if you run right! You have 2 basic forms of attack, a melee weapon and magic.Ok, I lied, you have 3 forms of attack, because if you hold Enter (Default attack button) whilst facing an enemy you can charge up a beamlike ranged attack, only issue with this is that it only charges when you're DIRECTLY facing enemies, and with the erratic enemy movement in this game its quite hard to use this, so I mostly stuck with magic and sword.Ok, I lied twice there, I mostly did magic with a side of sword as a playthrough (or majority of a playthrough, still need to finish it) because... well magic (bar the high mana cost, low MP pool even with max int and slow mana regen) was straight up BETTER than hitting people because most magic you get is AoE, and did I mention how enemies loved being ultra tanky and grouping up on you? This along with the aformentioned enemy attack animation make the combat hard AND not satisfying. Another thing is the bosses - none of them have Health Bars which I can see meaning I don't know if I am 20% way through the fight or 80% of the way through the fight.Now this is a game I want to like, it has loads of little nice quirks which I like but the combat, which is a large portion of this game, is so flawed and janky that I can only play this for one level at a time, grinding each area for a couple of level ups ontop of that.All in all, 4/10 - cheap fun flawed by bad combat"

,Recommended,263820,13580792,"Posted: 24 December, 2014",all,Raseht,"EvilQuest is a satisfying revival of action-adventure RPGs of the 8- and 16-bit. This game reminded me most of Crystalis on the NES, though it also has some similarities to Lagoon on the SNES. The map designs are similar as are some mechanics (jump boots.) Early on, the combat is fairly easy, though you may fail if you attack recklessly. Positioning and timing are most important for success, but, unlike the earlier action-adventure RPGs, enemies appear to have predictable cooldowns on their projectiles and abilities, making it far less likely you'll get surprised.The controls are responsive, however you can perform only one action at a time like in the older games previously mentioned. The one thing that sets it apart is that you can move and turn your character while attacking, allowing you to control quarter- or half-circle sweeps with your weapon; otherwise, every attack is a forward jab. Opponents can do this also, which can catch you off-guard when flanking a foe.While formulaic, it's a tried-and-true recipe. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genre and art style."

But it's just too easy.Story:Not great, it's just the same as a hero saving the world - In reverse! It's about a villain destroying the world. It's predictable, but it's not bad.Graphics and Music:Aren't great either. The graphics represent all they should, but I feel like it's too plain. The designs are good, though, the bosses look awesome. The music is your usual MIDI medieval track. Nothing too shiny.Gameplay:Super simple. I've finished the game in the Hard difficulty in the exact registered play time that I have. In the boss battle, I've only died once, and that was in his first form, just because of a little fumble...There aren't many secrets, and that is a bad thing for me. Just make sure you explore everything and you'll get all the equipment and spells. I've only used the heal spell through the entire game, also.Game Entertainment:The hours that I put into this game didn't feel empty. It's a fun game, but sometimes you feel like an area could have been shorter. But the final boss battle is going to counterbalance any bad things in the game - It's great.Overall:I rate it 9/10. It's not like you can ask more for this price! Just needs more secrets, filling some empty areas, a better looking grass, and it would have been perfect!"

A short adventure worth the cheap price.This game is extremely cheap and the premise of playing as a villan is intresting enough, but it's not executed well. The story is a revenge plot about a Dark Knight who is bent on taking over the country, and eventually the world. The dialouge is basic, but you'll probably laugh at how hard the writers tried to make your character ""BADASS and RUTHLESS"" As far as story is concerned, the game isn't too gripping. It's all about the gameplay here, which was a rollercoaster of good and bad core mechanics. You run around the world killing monsters to level up and collect eqipment and spells. The freedom to be more spell or melee focused is satisfying and well appreciated. Your melee attacks can be enhanced with a charge that turns it into a projectile that deals much more damage. Spells are split up into magical categories and the rate at which they are required is steady and unlocking the next magicical ability is genuinely exciting. The combat is engaging and the bosses are designed to accomodate your large arsenal of skills. On the other hand, the normal enemies are laughable and can easily be killed with continous shots from your sword. The pixelated graphics have moderate details, matching 16-bit era games, but the illustrations used for the cutscenes are unsettling to look at. there is something about the style that I just don't find appealing. The music usually fits the mood with a couple of stand-out tracks(The field theme). If you like action RPG's or the game crystalis go ahead and buy the game. it provides a decent 6-9 hours of gameplay and is fairly harmless when you consider it's EXTEREMELY cheap price."

,Recommended,263820,9224273,"Posted: 22 February, 2014",all,Serivik,"As other reviewers mentioned, EvilQuest has a lot in common with the old NES game Crystalis; plot items are themed after the four elements, mostly linear equipment progression, combat is fast and involves a lot of dodging.EvilQuest is pretty short. I played on Normal, and won the game in only a few hours, and only died once. I'm an RPG veteran, though, so it may provide a greater challenge and maybe an extra hour or two if you aren't as familiar with this type of game.Playing the bad guy is... kinda corny, honestly. The main difference is that you fight a bunch of ""good"" guys and that you backstab almost everyone after they help you. The story is eh, but it doesn't get in the way of the action, so it could be worse.Overall, EvilQuest is a great buy. At such a low price, it's hard not to recommend it."

Story wise the big difference is this time rather than trying to stop the generic EVIL bad guy bent on world domination you play as the EVIL bad guy bent on world domination.  The story is fine and the EVIL twist makes it all feel fresh even though its about as simple as a RPG story gets.The gameplay consists of attacking enemies with swords and such, holding down the attack button for a projectile attack, and some different magic attacks that you can find while exploring, or buy if you save up enough gold.  There are plenty of armor pieces to find to make you stronger, and accessories that make you more powerful in various ways, even a cape that makes you invisible.The graphics look good for a 16 bit style, some of the enemies are merely reskined as you progress in the game, but others like dragons and ghost make for a nice visual treat as you make your way thru the game.  The levels are all based on elements like fire and water and look and play nice enough with just enough exploration to give the game some meat.  My only complaint is enemies respawn after you slightly move away from an area, so you can't clear a level per say, the enemies are always respawning.  This dose give you plenty of opportunity to gain exp points and level up, but as the game wares on it all gets a bit repetitive, but at about 5 hrs for a diligent explorer EvilQuest isn’t long enough for this to become a problem.Overall EvilQuest is a very fun ARPG that lets you experience the generic RPG story of those 90ies RPG's from the eyes of the bad guy and plays like a dream.  For the cost of less than a gallon of gas (in the US at least) this game is an absolute steel and should be played by anyone who likes Zelda like ARPG's or wants to be EVIL."

It comes off as something like a late NES or early SNES/Genesis title... if that perspective helps. You are a very powerful, evil dude that gets betrayed by his army and locked up. However, you escape captivity and go on a quest to regain your mighty power and ultimately seek to destroy God himself. Sounds pretty cool, right?You basically go around overworlds seeking towns and dungeons. You can do some generally mean things along the way, but you're focus is to find four elemental things and then go to the final area once the barrier is broken. It's some standard, by the books stuff. But it works. Along the way, you fight through monsters and bosses in a Zelda-esque fashion. Defeating them will net you gold, which can be used to purchase equipment to make yourself stronger and items to recover from loss of health, loss of magic, or status ailments. As you progress, you'll find stronger weapons and different spells to help you tackle your foes. Also gained from defeated enemies are experience points. Getting enough of these will allow you to level up. Upon gaining a level, you have the option to distribute a number of points into whichever stats you see fit. This can be fun for building a specific way for different playthroughs. Want to beef up your magic skills? Maybe you want to deal mighty blows with your weapons. Or perhaps you just want to be a well rounded warrior. It's nice for some customization and replay value, yet not too complicated as to overwhelm the player. I also would like to point out that I thought the music was alright, but I do enjoy the art style quite a bit. Guess I'm a softy for that kind of thing.However, every game has its faults, as does EvilQuest. I can't complain too much with the main character being bad, as it is not often done still and keeps things a bit interesting. I guess I just wish they had maybe gone a little further with that idea. Maybe that's just me. My biggest complain comes from some expectations that were built up a bit and never capitalized on. Near the start of the game you get the charge ability, letting you shoot a projectile from your weapon at no cost to magic. You then use this to hit a switch through a wall and open a gate. A little while later is a switch puzzle, where some need to be up and some need to be down. Ithought this would mean there would be cool puzzle elements throughout the game like in Zelda games. However, there weren't much more like that to be found. I guess I was hoping it'd break up some of the grinding and killing, but I guess I didn't need to grind so that part was my own fault. My most minor and rather meaningless complaint is that, in order to get all the achievements, you have to play the game twice. Yet there seems to be only one achievement that absolutely forces you to do it. The one based on difficulty. If you play on normal, you have to beat it again on hard. Also, if you play it on easy, you'll get no achievement, which doesn't make much sense. But it's all in the achievements so it's really not even an issue with the game itself. Hardly worth mentioning but... I did. So... sorry.It's a cool retro-inspired action adventure RPG. If you like Zelda games and the RPG leveling stuff, give it a look. The game is only two bucks normally, and even less when it goes on sale. It's very much worth the price. This could possibly have passed for a ten dollar game, five at the least. But the fact that it's only two bucks makes it hard to pass up. Sure, it could use some more stuff in it, but the things included are good, especially for that asking price. So go ahead and get your copy. Forget the hesitation and go for it.EvilQuest gets a 6/10. Everything is solid. It may not be the longest, most fleshed out, or most impressive, but what it does offer is quite a good experience and well worth the price."

This is an indie game developed by maybe 5 people judging by end credits scroll.Pros:+ Nostalgic-feeling callback to early-90's games+ Full controller support and audio options+ Replayability through harder difficulty mode and different stat builds*+ Save states*In order to reach an achievement:You have to level up one of your 4 level up stats to 35, for each achievementwhich is impossible to achieve in one playthrough, where having save states helps.Cons:- Skill level in art/design of the game leaves some weird choices in full display (Cutscene eyes, character model's feet)- One or two songs on the soundrtack that are a bit too manic- Game balance falls off toward the end when you have become a walking apocalypse, though that's not to say it isn't enjoyable.I feel like this is one of the better options available for people that want a nostalgic-feeling game to play for a few hours. There may not be as many secrets or as much replay value as Shovel Knight, but that was developed by a much larger team, as well as having more inside. I feel like Evil Quest has about 4 hours of content for the main game, but it is easily worth 20+ hours of your time if you are a completionist, or just want to experience the game over again.Final Verdict:7.8/10 - Occasional cringy-looking art and crazed fast-paced music are the only complaints to be found with this title."

I guess if you're looking for more of a challenge, play a melee build instead. The game also allows for potion spamming so as long as you're stocked up, you really can't be defeated.

Without going out of my way to look up the creators' bios, I'm going to say that this is an early effort from a couple of guys who wanted to create a whole game by themselves--design, programming, art, and music--but who weren't experts at any of the above. This is the kind of game you'd expect to find as a curiosity in the ""early portfolio"" section of someone's website while they keep working to develop more mature work. I'm kind of surprised it's up for sale.The art is dull. You'll see every enemy type in the first couple of dungeons, and then it's palette swaps for the rest of the game. Environments, level designs, all forgettable. Bosses are a little bit interesting to look at, but not much.The music is poorly produced and forgettable.The writing is simply miserable. There is no reason to care about the plot or any of the characters. There are no funny or clever lines.The gameplay is tolerable. Controls are generally responsive. But there's nothing to keep you interested. Enemies either rush you or rush you and shoot at you. You respond by whacking them with a sword or axe that doesn't feel all that satisfying to swing, and occasionally with long-cooldown spells. You get periodic armor upgrades that are strictly numbers-up, no gameplay changes or new character art, and a handful of weapons that all do the same thing.

The combat isn't inspired, and the hitboxes take some getting used to (it's bigger than it looks on your sprite). Attacking is a bit tedious, and magic, especially early on, consumes so much of your meter and takes so long to recharge that you'll find yourself using the first spell, Ice 1, through most of the game, just because it's cheaper to cast. Heal 3 makes the game trivially easy. Once you get that (you can get it just before the ice dungeon), you can almost instantly heal up from any attacks, and unless you get overwhelmed by a rapid assault, nothing will kill you. The final boss can be defeated by standing still and spamming projectiles and healing, even in the hardest difficulty. Hard difficulty is barely that. The only difference is that enemies have tons more health and do a little more damage, meaning fights take longer and you have to heal more often.The characters are one-note and repetative. Your main character has only one mood, angry, and he will resort to murder for virtually every situation. Even some potential allies wind up being killed for essentially no reason. The main character's motivation is nothing more complex than ""destroy the world"". So yes, in that it features a quest of an evil character, this is an evil quest. However, that is all it is. The other NPCs come in two types: ""I will kill you, you monster!"" and ""Please don't murder me, Mr. Bad Guy!"". You will always kill the first type, and usually kill the second type. That's it. There is nothing more interesting to the plot.If you can get this game on some crazy sale, you may as well, if you wanna kill a few hours. I got it for about a dollar. If you can't get it for less than 3 bucks, don't bother, because you won't get much back."

EvilQuest, is not the kind of game that is fresh, or new. Many of the retro styled games at least try to advance on old ideas; whereas this one is a blatant copy of one of my favorite titles, Crystalis. The charging of your weapon, to the layout of the overworld. There is however a refreshing feeling I have, when playing it. It may be a copy, but it is done quite well. Sure, one could argue, that the sprite design is poor, and cheesily bad. But then again look at LJN; they were charging full game price, and most of their games were hardly playable. One area 'EvilQuest' tries to advance, is the story. Now, back in the old times of NES, and SNES, we were always forced to play as the 'Hero'. This was the way things were; and it worked, damn well, at that. This was the golden age; the stories were good, the gameplay was majorly addicting, and the sprites were done so well, that we could literally see them pop off the screen. Evilquest does some of these things right. But I digress. The story is one area where they advanced, as we get to play as the villian, for once. You start out as a reknowned antagonist named, Galvis. He is all sorts of evil badassery. We are only told this through the title, game trailer, and some of the dialogue. Thus, it is the weakest point in the game. When all you are killing is monsters in the overworld; how can you call your game, EvilQuest? Seriously, this is my only real annoyance. 6/10 Great price, somewhat good title."

I love that there are so many indie developers paying homage to the golden age of gaming and this is one that is up there for a must play for anyone who grew up with NES and/or SNES. I art is very amatuerish but do not let that fool you this game is about gameplay. The game does seem very derivative and it seems to get really repetitive the thing that saves it the most is the fact that you are the villian instead of the hero which turns the old school action RPG on its head. Our ""hero"" is on a mission to conquer and pillage and burn everything good. The story is very similar to other games of its ilk that require you to go through different dungeons and find important items so you can move to the next area. Certain items are required to advance the game and things need to be done in a certain order. There is no objective marker telling you exactly where to go and who to talk to. So discovery is an important aspect of the game just like in the classic 16-bit Action RPGs. There is no excuse to pass up this gem at only a measly $2."

With different enemies ranging from projectile shooting ones to just regular (easier) ones that only do damage when you touch them, it makes you learn the enemies. There's also magic with many different spells throughout and a charged projectile attack so make things easier on those annoying bosses.Story: It's a fairly straightforward story but provides an interesting direction to the game. Many of the conversations that Galvis has with other characters provides for interesting content and quite a bit of humor.Characters: Aside from Galvis, the other people in towns provide information on direction in the storyline, just enough info that you'll have to pay attention but nothing overly detailed that's confusing so you can get right to the next part.Gameplay: From herbs and potions to spells and weapons, there are quite a few items that can be bought and gathered to increase your stats (attack, defense, all that). The leveling up system in this is also spot on. There's never a time where things are too easy or too hard due to the perfect balance.

For decades I have wanted more of that game, be it a sequel or, as is the case in EvilQuest, a 'spiritual successor'. A mere two hours in, I feel confident in saying that this game delivers.EvilQuest takes Crystalis and ever-so-slightly modernizes it, like adding in a map, quest log, improving the menu functions, and allowing the player to customize the character when levelling up. What it doesnotdo is add in unnecessary filters, particle effects, and bloom that would've been impossible in, say, 1990. It feels exactly like an early SNES or very late NES game, and is clearly made by a developer who loved his game.I have some slight disappointment in that there are no sort of puzzles in this game, just 'Do you have the McGuffin?"" anti-sequence-breaking checkpoints; this was one of my few complaints against Crystalis as well. You wander through the world murdering everything that you can, scouring the land for all the plot coupons to unlock the next zones. Thankfully,thisgame is kind enough to shepherd you back towards a relevant area so you don't spend hours looking through irrelevant low-level areas for things you've missed. The art style in the cutscenes also leaves something to be desired, but certainly falls within acceptable tolerances for an indie developer.Even with its limitations in mind, EvilQuest only costs a pittance, so if you enjoy top-down action RPGs you should certainly give this game a try."

Loads of fun in the combat mechanics and they are simple to adapt to as well whether you use a keyboard/mouse or controller (xbox 360 preferred of course.).The best part is that you get to be an evil character instead of the pure hearts you always play as.

Your character is a cold hearted SOB who will stop at nothing to make everyone in the world pay for his faulters as an evil general with aims on world control.

It IS, however, a fun action RPG that offers a decent challenge with a surprising amount of flexibility in play style. It's everything you would expect from an intentionally retro-style game. The graphics and music bring up those good old nostalgic feelings, but EvilQuest stands apart from similar games because of its dedication to its story. While most gamers may be tempted to overlook the story for its simplicity, I found it to be wholly satisfying.Without spoiling too much, I'll say that EvilQuest's story trashes the Good VS Evil in favor of an Evil VS All approach, and it works really well. I found myself caring about what happens next and who the protagonist would encounter. Think about that. These days, it takes a dash of something special in a game to make you actually care about what happens to the people in it, and EvilQuest has that spice.If you want a quick game with a moderate challenge and a rewarding story, you'd do well to grab EvilQuest.

Evilquest's plot can be discribed as.. basically the Song Verruca Salt sung from Charlie and the Choclate factory (hint: its the one about wanting the Whole World)Actually its nearly the plot from the First Final Fantasy, so its almost like playing that game from Garland's point of view.Gameplay is rather simple Zelda like combat, but getting new magic means more means to destroy enemies, ive heard from other reviews that magic is pretty overpowered if you focus completely on it, so maybe its best to even out your stats to keep gameplay fun (or crush everything with your unholy powers of the arcane, whatever floats your boat you World murdering Psychopath you.) although one minor gripe I had with the combat was the lack of any form the Zelda esc spin attack, but I guess magic is still useful, and you do get a ranged weapon.The core idea behind the game I think is what elevates it above an average one, that your not some Pig Farmer who must restore light to the world cause God told you, its just amusing playing as a complete Scumbag yet also wanting to succeed in his goal, even when you know the world is doomed if you do.Anyway to end, its fun for what it is, average gameplay but the game is improved by the fact your the Villain, I think of it were just a generic (save the world) plot, I would rate the game lower."

Two buttons.Story is funny and engaging.The Bad:Cut-scenes and dialogue faces are crudely drawn (like by hand using Mario Paint).Graphics are reminiscent of NES/SNES rather than super-powered like the current generation of games.Story is a little fun but nothing to really write home about.You don't get a team of friends so if you die it is ALL YOUR FAULT.Most NPC dialogue is useless.Even useful ones who tell you where to go next are a bit vague.Some exploration of the world is required to figure out where you're going.  (Only bad if you're in a hurry.)Music is not so great.After 2/3 of the game (maybe less) the combat and treasure hunting style gets a bit old.Boss fights are not very challenging.  Just use bigger magic and have more HP than regular monsters.The story is linear.  But maybe (if you like FFII or Legend of Zelda) you like that.The Ugly:Every face drawn for dialogue or cut-scenes!  Ha!Full Review:It is very much like an old NES or maybe SNES game in terms of the style.  So it's a bit like FFII or the first Legend of Zelda game but you play the enemy boss trying to conquer the world instead of a team of heroes trying to save it.  You advance the story when you reach a certain place at a certain point and you get a little ""cut scene"" or else a dialogue scene... be warned though the art for these is pretty bad.  Looks like it was hand-drawn by a six-year-old.  Between these scenes you are basically free to roam the world.  You can go from town to town by walking across a desert or a forest or whatever.  You will encounter enemies on the map.  They usually will chase you as soon as they see you.  You may have to fight multiple monsters at once.  Fighting is REAL TIME and simple:  hit them with a weapon or magic to kill them before they get close enough to hit you.  Much like in Zelda.  Enemy attacks vary.  Rats and wolves attack by just running into you (I suppose they get in close and bite you).  Soldiers often swipe at you with swords or lances.  Beware in the first dungeon, those lances have a long reach.  The flaming skulls toss fireballs at you.  Some other monsters can throw lightning bolts that go straight up/down at you and then turn to go straight left/right.  Bosses are like normal monsters but they have different movement and attack patterns and usually a lot more health.  And then you kill enough monsters to levelup.  You get a few free upgraded stats, and you get a few points to allocate as you choose.  The higher your level gets, the more upgrade points you get.  You start with 2 per level, then you get 3 after a while, etc.  Once you make it to town you can also buy upgraded armor, shields, rings, magic spells, and recovery herbs.  And you also find some of that stuff in treasure chests.  Much like Final Fantasy.  So yeah it's a little bit crude but it's DIFFERENT.  If you like the SNES/NES era rpg's (FF1, FF2, Legend of Zelda, etc.) and you feel like playing as the villain, then you'll get a kick out of this.  Not the best game of all time, but it is fun."

As many of the reviews have pointed out, it draws a lot of inspiration from Crystalis on the NES. And as an action-RPG, EvilQuest is competent and has some depth to the fighting mechanics. There are quite a few areas to explore and the story is pretty standard for a JRPG.But the writing, overall plot, and execution are lacking and need refinement or maybe someone more experienced in those areas. The game starts off with a bit of humor, but then half-way through loses that and the potential for some comedic moments.

Though technically this isn't an older game, its made in the spirit of some of my favorite SNES rpgs while adding something new!  It's simple to learn and it gets you hooked playing as an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!No impossible achievements that you can't get without at least 2 playthroughs which I like as a completionist.Pick it up and enjoy if you want to play something simple and less complicated like today's rpgs."

Got taught a spell a few times by threatening, only to kill them after anyway (scripted).  Also instead of battle scenes its more of an action RPG which speeds up the pace.Worth $5 or less I'd say."

You walk around a world in Legend of Zelda style, with level ups, weapons, armors, and spells. You fight a good number of enemies, but there are a few instances of Palatte Swap upgrades. I liked it, and hey, you might too."

Play on difficult if you have played any video game ever.Enemy AI, if you can even call it that, is so bad that you can easily approach and attack things with no danger. They are super generous with the amount of healing items you find as well, which you don't really need unless something weird happens.The last boss is God, and he was hitting me for 0 damage with most of his attacks. I just spammed my basic attack on nearly every boss in the game, not even caring if I was getting hit. They'd usually die before I had lost 25% hp.Still, it's like .99 cents, so why not."

Unfortunately, I will probably have to start the game over. There are save points right before bosses, but no health. I saved, was incredibly low on health (one hit would kill me), then realized there was a boss next. Every time I died, I would just spawn right in front of the boss. So, I either have to start over or beat the boss without getting hit once. Overall, really incredible game."

,Recommended,263820,24700531,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,retrogomagomes,"For a 2 bucks game, this one packs a lot of fun. Its mechanics are not great, the combat feel clumsy sometimes and later in the game your character got way overpowered with all the spells learnt and all gear upgraded. Evilquest is heavily based on a NES game called Crystalis and it gets the job done if you're expecting a good old school like game. It's not the best but I've played far worse games. it could be more polished.The graphics are bland, the music sounds like midi files from a karaoke machine. Enemies are almost the same, just with color/power variations for example, in the beginning of the game you fight regular soldiers. As you progress, the soldiers are stronger and their colors change. Same thing with some monsters. There is also some little things in the game that looks like it is unfinished, like the jumping and charged shot abilities. Your character is told to use these features to solve puzzles, but I think only twice I've used the jump and charged shot to solve puzzles.Overall it's a funny game to play in short bursts, as you can finish it in about 3-6 hours. I took longer because I like to explore every bit of the map and such. Also the funny bits of the game are entertaining, as you play with the villain this time. I'd recommend it for its low price if you like casual Zelda like clones. But if you are looking for a more retro feel and a challenging game, you should probably avoid this one. I'll give it a 6/10."

,Recommended,263820,35276957,Posted: 28 September,all,Razonix,"Well, that was a rather unusual experience. You usually play with the good guy and your objective is to save the world, right? In this game, it's the complete opposite: Your goal is to take over the world, and then put an end to it. No, you don't really get a chance to choose if you're going to play the good Samaritan role or not. The mechanics of the game are rather simple, in a certain sense it does bring some resemblance to old school games. The graphics are fairly simple, there's not much else to say about them. The soundtrack isn't quite captivating, but manages to keep you entertained while you're playing. The sound effects are basic, but they don't really affect anything whatsoever. As for the gameplay, there's an interesting combination of melee and different spells, which makes everything more versatile. The story, besides what was already written in the beginning, is pretty shallow and, unfortunately, the game doesn't get to explore the personality of the characters. You simply don't really get to feel anything for anyone (anger, empathy, pity etc.). Overall, if the objective of the game, besides providing some fun, was to make you feel as a sociopath and / or psychopath, then it was a job well done."
