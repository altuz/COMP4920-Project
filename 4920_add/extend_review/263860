To others, like me, who cannot commit to long sessions this essentially renders the game unplayable unless you stick to the smallest of maps.  As far as I'm concerned, then, the game is fundamentally broken.  The developers were very dismissive when I contacted them about it, so I'll return the favour and not bother to write anything else about the game."
,Not Recommended,263860,12166866,"Posted: 20 September, 2014",all,Phorth,"This at it's core is a straight forward graph analysis strategy game. It's simple to a fault after about an hour of play. The gameplay provides a series of graph maps that have three variables of defenses to overcome, the player has 5 options to construct fighting more the time than the actual difficulty, but often time for the objectives.The main issue I have with the game is that the construction done by the AI is constrained by different rules than the player; to put it flatly it cheats. The AI seemingly constructs ships out of bases at intervals rather than based upon the rules that the player must follow to construct ships, yielding an artificial difficulty that is thinly veiled once one starts pursuing other solutions of the objective maps.While the mechanics of the game are solid for a game of it's genre, it's very flat in comparison to it's peers and feels more like a stripped down board game for the computer."

,Not Recommended,263860,19683219,"Posted: 13 December, 2015",all,Shark4-6,"While the premise and concept of the game both were big selling points for this game, I cannot recommend it.Beginning Issues:1. Nobody Plays Multiplayer - While there is a structure for having MP games, there is no one to play with online. The most people I have seen online at one time were three, including myself.2.  AI Games are just bad - There is really no other way to say this, but in the two hours that I have played this game, it has only been against AI. These games typically amount to me pushing forward and finding the ""battle-line"" and then holding that until I can make enough units to move forward. Now one might think that to be the appropriate way to wage war in this setting, but the games eventually become a grind of fighting off waves of enemies that are too small to do any serious damage to your fleet and that just hurl themselves at you using no particular strategy. This is further more exasperated by the fact that the MP community is dead.More Serious Issues:1. AI - FIX IT2. Concept - While the concept is what drew me in at first, it soon became clear that it was a lot harder to execute than planned. In game, there are only 3 types of ships, Invading ships (for taking over planets), frigates (for fighting other starships), and the destroyers (they just destroy planets so enemies cannot use resouces). While only having three types of ships may fit the ""simplistic"" theme of the game, it is almosttoosimplistic, making the game boring because of the lack of variety.Summation:Overall, I really wanted to like this game. I really thought that the concept was interesting and different, and at first glance, the developers have done a good job with the base game. But when looking at the greater picture, the boring mechanics, the grindy gameplay, the $hit AI, and the Empty MP, I simply can't recommend this."

Highly recommended if you are really into the pros listed below but are willing to put up with some missing features (in my opinion).PROS:- Awesome minimalist & stylish interface (probably one of my favorites)- Great ambient music and sound effects- Various difficulty levels- Overall very accessible & easy to pick up for an RTS- Games can be as quick or as long as you want them to be depending on map size- Simplified design with abstractions at just the right places while maintaining a strong emphasis on strategy & deep gameplaySuggested improvements:- Keyboard shortcuts -- This is a must for any fast-paced RTS. For example, it would be great to be able to bookmark my shipyard so that I could hit ""1"" then ""A"" to build a battle fleet without having to keep locating it on the map and navigating through the menu to queue a unit.- The ability to set a waypoints or rally points for resulting shipyard production. Oftentimes my shipyards are at least a couple hops away from where I want my forces to end up.- Another player on the forum suggested the ability to see ""at-a-glance"" how well I'm performing in a battle without having to click on the battle itself. This would be extremely helpful in hectic situations where multiple battles are occurring simultaneously.- An at-a-glance display of the number of units of each type currently occupying a system. Instead of having the one icon indicating just the types of units present, there might be two icons if you had for example both a battle fleet and an invasion fleet. Both icons would have their corresponding fleet counts listed. (Or maybe just three counts next to the single icon?) This would be very helpful for quickly planning strategies to amass forces proportionately.Overall though, a game with a lot of promise; it's very easy to sink a bunch of hours in it the way it is.  Keep up the good work devs."

I love how it looks simple, how it allows to play a multiplayer strategic game in less than an hou, how it allows the player to take its time. I do also really like the look of the game and its mecanism :Few units with very distinct roles, feed lines that can be hijacked, simple fog of war and combat sytem giving its full value to scouting and sentries, simple but efficient planet upgrades, highest speed in systems you control... Really, that's plenty of clever and well thought minimalist mecanism.However, when the developers states ""Heavily focused at multiplayer"", it does not mean that multiplayer is particularly weel done. Actually, many features are missing to correctly organise games and interract with your oponents.No what it means, is that simple player, and more specifically the AI, is a joke.First, the AI does not follow the same rules as the player : ships are produced at their headquarter. The ennemy does not even try to develop its economy, nor properly attack you. It knows how to produce ships in its factories, but rarely does so. While conquering an HQ, I noticed that it was filled with siege and invasion ships : enough to wipe out half of the map, and conquere the rest. But none of these ships had ever moved from there. Worse : the ennemy did not seem to have produced any fighter, which could have helped him, against my strike.So, it really feels like the dev did not even try to implement any kind of AI, or that if they tried to do so, countless bugs severely crippled it down.""Missions"" might be more interresting, but they play like tower defense.So my only hope to fully appreciate this game would be a proper AI update, a more efficient way to organize multiplayer games (taking in account player scarcity), or be lucky enough to have someone logging at the same time as me...There is some great potential there. But the game needs more love !Should I recommand it ? Well, if you are ready to wait for someone and play multiplayer yes. Otherwise, no. Or hopefully, not yet..."
,Recommended,263860,21066232,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,LeoTindall,"TL;DR: Not flashy, not tactical; pure and unadulterated grand strategy with a beautiful atmosphere and deep, satisfying mechanics. Easily worth twice the price.This game is everything I've wanted in space grand strategy since I played Empire at War at age 10. The atmosphere, conveyed by the cleverly-animated background, the consistent and beautiful UI style, and the brilliant but subtle music, is reminiscent of DEFCON: Everybody Dies. While the game might appear simplistic and shallow on the surface, the variety and quality of the maps and a well-thought-out, perfectly balanced array of game mechanics makes it infinitely re-playable, especially with friends.A must for:anyone who wanted to be Ender, who likes DEF CON, or who thinks that the Galactic Map was the best part of Star Wars: Empire at War. This game is effectively the same as playing SWEaW in Galactic Map and always using autoresolve (but, of course, much better balanced for that purpose).Avoid it if:you preferred Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to Supreme Commander in 2007, or if what you most appreciate most in Total War games is watching the little men fight."

A basic 'command and conquer' (the style, not the old title) strategy game which oozes with potential if the developers would give it a little more attention (a few mechanics are not explained fully, there are more things that could be added) and promotion (very few people I have come across, who would buy and play this game, know about it).If you love good, pure strategy games this WOULD be the one for you... IF it actually had an active community. I recommend the game highly, it's is very enjoyable and has ample replayability... if only if there were actually players to play against (AI get's predictable, like all games). I live in hope that someday this will be more popular."
,Recommended,263860,12270359,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,St0nkingByte,"An awesome take on a well established genreSPACECOMis a really neat game that takes on the well established 4X genre, boils it down to its most simple elements and presents it in a very approachable and playable fashion.  Somewhat akin to chess this doesn't ultimately make the game any less complex or deep because beneath the simple surface lies a hard-core strategy game that provides some amazing experiences.  Adding to the experience is the dichotomy that this game is both fast and slow.  What I mean is that you can play out a full battle in just 20 minutes, though most scenarios are longer, but in each session you can change strategies and try a different approach multiple times.  Bad decisions are not always fatal and often you can flip your entire approach around and claim victory from what you thought would have been defeat.  As you play you begin to see this shifts in strategy as mega strategies in themselves.OverallSPACECOMputs hard-core 4X strategy in a neat and simple to learn multiplayer package.  It's the kind of game where even when you lose you are usually having fun.  And isn't that the point of any game?One note, the single player experience is pretty simple and the AI fairly easy to defeat.  The real action is in multiplayer.  However with a small community around this game expect to open a game room and wait a bit before someone joins.  That said, your patience is almost always rewarded."

I really haven't figured that out yet, the ships you can build are, battle fleets, these are the ones you destroy enemy ships with if you haven't figured out, the second ship is invasion fleets, you must have these to being able to invade, it's really self explainatory, and the third ship is siege ships, so what can you do with those? take a wild guess!
