The concept is great, the music is fantastic, and the graphics are colorful and appealing.  Where Aquakitty failed for me was poor gameplay and lack of content.The game starts off simple, but as the difficulty ramps up, excessive quantities of bullet-sponge enemies appear and the player isn't given enough firepower to take out all of them effectively, which you MUST do for each level.  The game becomes an exercise in waiting a LONG time for things to die in front of the ship while more enemies spawn in which gets increasingly tedius and unfun.  The original 'Defender' makes you feel fast and powerful despite how hard it is - Aquakitty just makes you feel impotent due to the ridiculously low fire rate.The game spawns enemies suddenly with absolutely no transition, and is shameless in putting them right over the cats you need to defend. As a result you end up succeeding more if you ignore the main game screen and focus on the RADAR, which does not center on your ship; if you don't look at it constantly you will have to look for the orange dot every time.  Enemy patterns feel erratic and are generally a pain to deal with, and feels unrefined compared to de-facto classic shmup style games.  Getting farther in the game offers no significant new fun or gameplay elements as you advance, adding to the tedium.  The only upgrade it gives you for advancing is a bigger ""turboshot"" bar which you never have enough of anyway.  Once you get 10 levels in and a few mere minutes of play, you've pretty much seen everything, and thats not much different than how it starts.  In general the game isn't even that difficult - its just comes off as being boring and annoying.Presentation is strictly bare-bones and there's no controller config so I had to use JoyToKey to let me use the shoulder triggers to reverse direction.  One of the biggest problems I have is that despite the clever theme and cute cat art, there's no story, not even a still picture with text to drive a narrative as to what you are doing, why you are doing it, or incentive to keep you interested.  As a result, the cats are more or less a graphic skin with no bearing on gameplay and no story content.  I expected more.  The trailer made the game seem a lot better than it is, and I really wanted to like it.  Maybe for a $3 price point I would have been fine with the mobile-app level of production values and features but not for $7.  Hope this review is helpful in making your purchasing decision."

While the first few levels are enjoyable, and all seems well intially, the game quickly divebombs into frustrating and tedious territory.Good:- Great pixel art- Decent amount of levels/content for an arcade style game and the price.- Very easy to learn and control.Bad:-Geared heavily towards luck, too little towards skill. The advantage of bullet hell shooters is that there are patterns and expectations. Players can develop skills based on what they learn from patterns. Not so here: enemy positions are randomized which creates a ton of frustration. One game you'll have red jellies congregated in one area, another game you'll be frantically rescuing the cats one after another.- The player is woefully underequipped to combat the majority of enemies. They absorb a stupid amount of bullets and the power ups, except the two extra cats and the bomb, are faily useless.- Half the nemies are programmed to dive out of the way of your vehicle. This may sound interesting at first, until you realize how much time you're spending chasing enemies that randomly move out of the way of your already underpowered weapons.- Difficulty essentially equates to dumping increasing amounts of enemies around the screen randomly, often before you've even finished a particular wave of foes.- The foreground art will regularily cover enemies and bullets making navigating around the map incredibly annoying and, again, make your survival a lucky happenstance.- Bullet travel length is based on the direction and speed you travel, amking moving forward actual disadvantagous in most situations, despite moving being what you need to do to survive.- Balancing looking up at the alarm and surviving while doding bullets is way too much to handle. There should have been any easy indicator or red arrow to show a cat is being abducted and the quickest way too them. I can't count how many cats I lost simply because the game expects you to juggle way too much visual information at once with so little direction.It's really a shame because the first few levels promise so much more than what this game becomes. I can't recommend it when there are so many better arcade shooters in this genre available. Cute graphics and cats simply don't win out over undercooked gameplay."

,Recommended,263880,20668438,"Posted: 21 January, 2016",all,JacquesLeSauve,"In the space year 20XX, the entire world's supply of milk appears to have ""ran dry"". This would suggest to me that sometime in the future all form of breasts will become either extinct or outlawed and force us to look elsewhere for our creamy goodness. As luck would have it for our kitty chums, though, ""deep under the ocean, vast amounts of what appear to be naturally forming full fat milk were discovered"". Don't ask me how the milk is now lying under the ocean. Perhaps all the world's mammaries will migrate to below the surface to escape danger or persecution in the future? Either way I guess it's only natural that boobs would eventually start heading downwards with the passage of time. But however they got there, the kitties are determined to get it out and launch an operation to mine it and send the milk gushing back forth into the world once more. But it's not a task without peril for our hungry kitties as they're attacked by unknown enemies who try to kidnap the underwater miners and keep all the lovely, delicious milk for themselves. ""OH NOES!"", cries the kitty captain. Oh noes, indeed. So out sets a brave pilot to shepherd the miners and destroy the threat, keeping his furry brethren in one piece and saving the world's milk(/boobs?) in the process...If anybody says the story is dumb then you and me are gonna step outside and have words, alright?! Anyway, on with the review.In Aqua Kitty - Milk Mine Defender, you'll pilot a small, one-man sub... one-cat sub? Whatever. You'll pilot a sub through stages that loop around on themselves and are no higher than the height of the screen, shooting waves of enemies until all have been wiped out while taking care not to lose all of your miners who walk the surface (as long as one is kept alive you're fine). Additional enemy types are gradually introduced as levels progress and power-ups are occasionally dished out to help your efforts. Its basic formula is simplicity itself, and in that comes so much of its addictive appeal and accessibility as the game sinks its claws into you and doesn't let go.It isn't exactly laid out this way, but essentially there are three modes in the game. There's the standard style of play (available in easy and normal difficulties) where your progress is saved and failing a level means simply restarting it at any point from a map screen, while power-ups are temporary and don't carry on through stages. There's Arcade Mode, which sets you the challenge of making it through all 25 stages with one life, but with power-up drops being replaced by gems which can be used to purchase upgrades which do carry through stages but are also degraded with each hit you take. And then there's Infinite Espresso mode (also available in easy and normal) where you have to make it through as many waves as possible with one life and very limited power-ups, but at least with no miners to worry about.There's a slight retro, SNES era style about the look of the game, complete with ""chunky"" sound effects and some outstanding music that never gets old and even manages to stay lodged in your head long after you've finished playing. Some people have commented about the game being too difficult. I don't really play many side scrolling shooters like this, and wouldn't consider myself especially gifted at them or anything, but I can't say I had all that much trouble with it. There were a few problem stages, sure, and achievement hunters beware, unless you have the twitchy reflexes of a coked-up cat with Tourette's on his fifth can of Red Bull then you're gonna have a ball-achingly hard time getting 100%. But to just complete the game and get most of the experience this has to offer, the rest of us mere mortals should do just fine.I think it says a lot that even 30 or so hours into this game, no matter how many times I died I still more often than not had a smile on my face and rarely did I ever feel the game was cheap or unfair (maybe aside from the red, grabby b*astards that steal your miners. THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO FIRE! I swear I get nailed by their single, slow shots more than anything else). The hours easily flew by without me noticing and I found I had to stop myself from carrying on anymore trying to beat the harder challenges. If that's not a glowing recommendation for anything then I don't know what is. If I had any complaints it would be that sometimes your sub doesn't feel quite as sharp or responsive as you might like in some of the tighter spots. And while it's perfectly possible to play with a keyboard, I'd strongly advice using a controller. But otherwise, I loved almost everything about this game. Oh, except the fact they had a cat piloting a ship and didn't call him Commander Kitty... I'll never be able to forgive them for that."

The map at the top is a 2D view of the sea going left and right. You can travel in circles by reaching the far end of either left or right. The map plays a very important part in the defence of the milkminers as it can give the local of each, (red dot abducter jellyfish), (white dot normal robot fish), (yellow power-up) and lastly the local of the milkmine.

I was disappointed to the game as ""arcade shooter with branching campaign"" made me expect a game like some of the old arcade shooters such as Gradius or U.N Squadron and similar ones. In these games each level is side-scrolling level with various enemies and usually a big boss at the end. In this game the ""campaign"" is not that. Each level is the same, with no bosses and they don't have the side-scrolly feeling as the map just wraps around from the edges.In each level you have varying amount of milk mines, which you have to baby sit and kill enemies. New enemies are introduced every now and then. The ""branching campaign"" is just choice between couple different levels, which in the end are just different amount of waves of different types of enemies. Playing through the levels get quite repeatative, very quickly.Upgrades in the game are just temporary time based power-ups you pick up and in arcade mode you can buy the same upgrades during the levels and they stay between levels. You also earn upgrades in campaign mode for progressing through the levels. I was hoping for more detailed leveling/upgrading system, similar to U.N Squadron or Tyrian 2000 with different types of weapons and ships.But all of these things I whine about are because I was expecting things from the game based on my ideas of what ""arcade shooter"" should have been. It is a solid game and I'm sure some people enjoy the game as is but it's not for me.The art style is great and I enjoy the silly cat aspect of it. Soundtrack of the game is really amazing if you like chiptune music like I do. It was the first thing that caught my eye about the game. The game has 8 tracks, levels 1-5, title screen music, level select and extra music. If you consider this game as buying a 8 track chiptune music album with an arcade shooter as a bonus then it's probably worth a purchase, especially during a sale."

,Recommended,263880,9045726,"Posted: 10 February, 2014",all,The Rock Star Space Ferret,"The following review is for the VITA PSM version, but it also applies to the PC version.Being more of a dog fan, my first thought upon hearing this game was ""It should be called Aqua Doggies,"" but little did I know how utterly -cute- this game was going to be.Although arcade-y games such as Aqua Kitty really have no need for a plot, I feel like I must mention the plot to this one. Basically what happened is that far in the future, the world's milk supply has ran out. To a cat, it probably amounted to pure torture. Ironically however, real cats can be lactose intolerant. Go fig. At any rate, all was not lost, for the cat scientists (yes, there are cat scientists!) have discovered that the ocean floor is actually bursting with milk. Who would've thunk it, huh? All the cats have to do is overcome their fear of water, swim down to the ocean bottom in scuba suits, and start drilling away for free flowing milk.Sound really easy and simple, yes? Well, no. It turns out that the ocean is a very dangerous place, especially for kittehs, and they don't seem to want intruders in their watery domain. What's more, ocean dwelling aliens want to beam these miner kittehs up in their spaceships (that also acts like a sub apparently) and whisk them off to space to put in their intergalatic zoos. Okay, so I lied about the zoos, but at least I didn't say they were beamed up to be skinned alive and eaten. The morality rate for these space kittehs must be abysmally small, but hey, -somebody- has to do it, for THE MILK MUST FLOW!So that's pretty much the plot. Isn't it the most weirdest, most inventive story anyone has ever come up with? The plot may be weird, but the gameplay sure isn't.You star as the tough, one-eyed patch-wearing cat piloting a submarine as you defend the miner cats from the denizens of the deep. You move left and right in a wrap-around screen, and can switch directions on the fly. Blast everything that moves, but be sure to be on the lookout for special critters that will attempt to capture a poor kitteh and whisk it off to space while you're busy trying to keep yourself alive. If it manages to escape, then the mining station it was attending to explodes. If all the kittehs are captured, or you get blown up, then it's game over.If all this sounds awfully familiar to you, then it should. Aqua Kitty is actually an updated version of an old classic arcade game called Defender, which was made by Williams Electronics in 1980, and it was you you in a spaceship protecting the astronauts from aliens.In essence, if you loved Defender, I don't see how you could possibly hate Aqua Kitty. The gameplay is the same, but with cats and water. The developers, Tikipod LTD, chose to use a graphical style similar to Amiga games of yore. All of you may be too young to remember the Amiga, but it was a brand of computers by Commodore in the 80's and 90s. I've never owned an Amiga, but man, some of its games sure had really colourful sprites. Aqua Kitty successfully captures the look of a classic Amiga game. Every sprite looks rich with colours and detail. The cats look so adorable as well, especially when blown up, like the below screenshot shows:The backdrops show a remarkable sense of 'alien-ness' when you see the stuff lying there at the ocean bottom. Strange plants dominate the landscape which seem to indicate the game takes place on an alien planet or a seriously mutated Earth. You may also see deserted cities that look like they've been bombarded upon. There's a whole backstory here that will forever remain a mystery.The creatures that the submarine tough cat has to face aren't your ordinary ocean critters, oh no. These are mechanical critters. Are they aliens, or normal ocean dwellers? Who knows. All you need to know is that you need to blast them. They come in many shapes and sizes, and most have the ability to shoot back at you from the front and behind, so you need to be careful. They come in waves, and in order to win the level, you must destroy every single one of them. You can see they all are from the convenient map situated at the top. Red dots signify the ones you really need to watch out for, for these jellyfish-type creatures are the ones who want to steal your fellow kittehs away. Make these your top priority. Although you can still win the level without saving all your fellow cats (you need to save at least one), how can you possibly live with yourself, knowing full well that you let your feline friends get abducted to spend the rest of their lives in some hideous intergalatic zoo? For shame!!!Your main blaster is what you'll be using most often. You also have a Turbo gun that fires faster and is more powerful. It has its own meter however so if it runs dry, you must wait until it powers up again. As you go through the stages, the meter gets increasingly larger so you can use it more often. It's perfect against the vertical purple enemies which have higher defenses than other enemies. There are three power ups you can acquire to increase your chances for survival. They appear has an enemy that you must shoot to gain them. One gives you a pod of 2 additional cats that lets you shoot more beams. The 2nd powerup drops a bomb. Run into it and it explodes, killing everything in its range. The third is a heart that refills part of your life bar. What powerup you get depends on how high (or low) the enemy is when defeated so plan your shot accordingly.There's two modes of play in Aqua Kitty. The main mode is a series of interconnected levels. Make it to the end and defeat the big boss to win. The other mode is more of a survival-type thing called Endless, where it's just you against an ever-increasing horde of enemies. There are no miner cats to save in this mode, which is disappointing because I miss having them around.The music is really nice and full of pumping tunes that keeps you coming back for more.There are two cons to this game, however. The first few stages are easy enough, but the further you go, the harder it becomes. By the last few stages, you're literally swamped with enemies and you'd be hard pressed to destroy them all while also keeping track of the jellyfish to save the miners. It's fast, frantic and incredibly difficult to save all the kittehs, but it is not impossible. Whether that is considered a con depends on the individual. Some people love the challenge and old arcade games, like Defender which this game emulates, often are difficult to begin with. Other people may not like the difficulty spike and will consider it a con.The other con isn't really a con and it's not the games' fault, but as the Vita version was the first version that the game came out on, it doesn't have all the new features that the later platforms have (PC, 360, etc). The new features included a Gradius-style survival mode but with miner kitties, 2 player co op, more weapons, tweaked graphics, etc. I've played the PC version and the new additions make the game even better. It's a shame the Vita version will never get the updated version.As it stands, Aqua Kitty is a great throwback to the classic arcade games of old, with pleasing music, eye-popping art and good, fast paced gameplay. It is also my favourite PSM game on the Vita. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't buy it NAO.PROSEasy controlsSuccessfully captures spirit of classic arcade gamesWonderful sprite work that resembles an Amiga gameGreat tunesGood gameplayImaginative storyCONSMay be too hard for someDoesn't have the new additions from other platformsNo dogs in it"

,Recommended,263880,29374739,Posted: 20 January,all,Capt_Blakhelm,"First Impression: Aqua Kitty - Milk Mine Defender is a cutesy, cat based modernization of the classic Defender game - if you have played Defender or Resogun, then you know what to expect. It's a pretty simple shmup that can be played casually until the later levels. You have a standard shot and a more poweful, cooldown based Turbo shot and can pick up different shot patterns and temporary support ships. The game can get a little hectic and a little annoying with alot of enemies large, bullet soaking and bullets on the screen, but I never found the game to be completely unfair.However, while this isn't the most cuteness overload game out there, this game is pretty closely aimed at cat lovers as nearly all cats have the ""COLON THREE"" smiley face, abducted cats always ""MEW!"", and the death screen starts with ""OH NOES!"" - so you will either love it or find it pretty droll. All of this cat cuteness is mostly a facade though, since there seems ot be no cutscenes or in game story explanation whatsoever - if it wasn't for the store page, I wouldn't know that the cats are trying to mine milk from the sea bed because of a milk famine (yeah, it's stupid).There is also local co-op, an easy mode, an arcade mode, in which you pick up gems to upgrade gear like Gradius, and an Infinite survival mode. The game appears to be short (though, you may have to repeat harder levels frequently), so you may want to wait on a sale if you only expect to play a single mode, but you will probably get your money's worth if you replay another mode or spend alot of time in Infinite Mode."

If you're not familiar with Defender at all, the premise is pretty simple: fly left or right in looping stages shooting all in your path while gaining power-ups and occasionally saving the odd human or two. Or in Aqua Kitty's case, cats.The story is simple and silly, the graphics are bright and vibrant, and the music is amazing. So what about the gameplay? Well, if you like Defender you're set. The controls are responsive, the shooting is satisfying, and the difficlty ramps nicely. There are plenty of different enemies to defeat so the game never becomes repetitive. It's a tad short, but with three difficulty settings and an Endless Mode, there's plenty of replayability.I thoroughly enjoyed this game.

,Not Recommended,263880,25877539,"Posted: 5 October, 2016",all,vic,"This game has cute pixel art graphics and nice music, but it is overall very limited.There are 25 levels but they are all in the exact same underwater setting (only 3 screens wide or so which loop around) with either 1, 2 or 3 spots to defend. There are two broad categories of enemies, the first are a variety of enemies which will go across the level while trying to annoy you by shooting at you, following you or avoiding your fire. The other kind are abductor enemies which will try to capture the kitties mining milk at the spots you need to defend. There are no patterns, the enemies will spawn at random places and go either left or right randomly. This is especially annoying when an abductor enemy spawns right on top of one of your kitties, and makes the successful completion of the later levels luck-based in a large part.As good ad the music is, there are only two tracks which will get old quickly.Most frustrating point for me, there are almost no upgrades of any kind for your ship. ""Almost"" because every time you complete a zone, you get an upgrade which allows you to use your alternate fire mode a little bit longer. But that's it, no fancy weapons for you, you will keep the same pea shooter all game long, and it does not even shoot all the way across the screen. Since enemies get tankier as you go along, completing a level becomes a matter of dodging random configuration of enemies and bullets and slowly killing them with your underpowered gun.There is however an ""arcade mode"" which allows you to collect powerups and keep them for the next level, but if you get hit even once you lose one level of all your powerups. You also can't retry, if you do the game is reset.I can enjoy a game that is frustrating but gives a big reward when you finally overcome the difficulty. This is not that kind of game, the reward is very small so it quickly came to a point when I stopped enjoying the time spent on that game. In the end I wouldn't recommend that game."

However this is where the challenge comes in; bump into enemy things too often and you die. Fail to keep all the little people (kitties) from being abducted and you lose also.

A good, simple arcade style game for short in-between-time gaming sessions. The explosion sound effects this game makes are simple, minimalistic and yet satisfying."

It even has a touch of comedy thrown into the gameplay. It can be challenging as it progresses. It's worth the price. Though you would probably enjoy it more with a controller than keys/mouse. Cats......and fish.......and. kawaii goodness.

,Recommended,263880,21707846,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Esanssi,"A rather frustrating, but oh-so-rewarding arcade shooter that's best played with a controller(in my experience). The graphics and the music are appropriate and delightful, both fitting very well into the whole retro vibe of the game.What keeps me going back for more though is the challenging and rewarding gameplay. Basically you have 2 to 3 ""milk mines"" in each level and you have to defend their operators from evil kidnappers. Things can get very hectic very quick as new waves of enemies complement the remnants of the last one, and since you can only take, in theory, five or so hits before you die, you'll be retrying a level over and over and over and over and over again.As stated in the beginning, the game can get very frustrating very quick, but the frustration's a good one. The type you get when you feel that a game challenges your skills fairly.So, if you're up for a retro arcade shooter with some challenge to it, give AKMMD a go. Heck, it's only 7 eurodollars, what do you have to lose?"

,Recommended,263880,19296655,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,MindfulOcean,"I originally left a negative review for this game because I felt the difficulty ramped up too quickly.  I've played the game a bit more and I do feel my initial review may have been too harsh.  The concept is cool, the graphics are pretty, and it is an all around fun shooter.  I was roughly at the half way point in the game before I felt it started becoming really difficult, so I don't think my initial criticism was fair.The game features two difficulties and an arcade mode.  In arcade mode, you can earn power ups and keep them as you play through the stages rather than having them for only a brief time as you normally would.  The tradeoff is that death is permanent.Overall, Aqua Kitty is great fun and I do recommend it."

Graphics are crisp, the mechanics work well.  It's not terribly difficult by the genre standards, but it's also probably a bit too hard for a casual gamer who might have seen ""Aqua Kitty"" and thought it might be easier.  I enjoyed it.  It does lack bosses, however, which makes the ""levels"" kind of anti-climatic (except for the last one and that can be cheesed easily).It's good.  It's kind of weird.  It's good."

,Recommended,263880,23467480,"Posted: 9 June, 2016",all,YuppieD,"This game is an excellent arcade style shootier that borrows concepts from Defender. You have to protect little kitties that are mining milk from the bottom of the sea (it makes a ton of sense that milk is found in the sea, but whatever....video games). If you let the enemies capture them, the mines are destroyed and the level ends. Certain enemies go after the milk miners whereas others just get in the way and make it harder to target the attackers. The game is fast paced and challenging at times. It has an easy and normal difficulty setting to appeal to gamers of different skill levels. The graphics are awesome wit a throwback to the 16 bit era. The sound track also consists of some of the best chip tunes I have heard in a while. There is two player co-op to add more fun to the mix. HIGHLY recommend this game. It is well worth the price!"
76561198253881953,Not Recommended,263880,34927962,Posted: 13 September,all,matt,"Such nice graphics, sound, and concept, all wasted on annoying gameplay.The game could have used more depth: maybe more than just the starting weapon, maybe some level variety, or even some substantial difference in enemies... but the game would have at least been fun in its current state were it not so irritating to play...One constant annoyance is the radar - it's nearly useless. The gameplay area keeps your ship in the center part of the screen, scrolling the background as you move, wrapping around when you go past the edge. The radar is a fixed view of the level, moving a dot that represents your player... a dot that is identical in size and shape to the other dots for enemies, powerups, etc. Because of this, you can never glance at the radar, you must always stop for a few seconds to:- scan the hundred dots- pick out the one that is yellow (you)- pick out the ones that are white (your goals)- compare your location to the location of the thing you want to get to- account for the wrap-around (if something appears to the left of your ship on the radar, you may actually have to go to the right and wrap around to get to it fastest)- press the .... forget it, you're long dead by nowThe most annoying detail is the randomness. Nearly everything is random. It makes the game difficult, but not fun. There are no strategies to devise, challenges to overcome, or satisfaction from succeeding... it's just a roll of the dice. Where will the next enemy appear? You can't tell. How will an enemy move around the screen when you're trying to shoot it? You can't tell. Will a bomb end up near an enemy you want to kill? You can't tell. Gameplay is just floating around a bucket of randomly placed enemies, moving about randomly. Winning is simply replaying a level a dozen times to get a good random sequence; practice can't much past basic shooting and dodging, since there's nothing to learn.Completed or Quit: Completed"
