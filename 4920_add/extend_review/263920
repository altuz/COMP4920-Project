I love the graphics and I really like how things explode into bits when killed or destroyed. The accessories and weapons are all pretty fine and all the weapons are relatively usable as well, which is rare for today's games.The developer constantly replies to threads and is always listening to the feedback given in the forums, which is just astoundingly great.I haven't come across any bugs in this game yet and anything that I think needs to be changed the developer has addressed already and stated he will be doing something about it in his next update. I'd really recommend this game if you even mildly enjoy twin sticks, zombies, or games with online multiplayer and the option for single player as well.8.5/10. Now i'm gonna go play some more"

The entire game is buggy and undone and needs to be redone.

,Recommended,263920,19091987,"Posted: 15 November, 2015",all,Bee,"It dawned on me that the title of this game isn’t just a fun play on words—if you’ve ever wondered how hordes of zombies would fare inside a blender, then you’re in for a treat!Zombie Grinder plays exactly as it reads—and it’sglorious. Moments after starting any game mode, the ground is painted green, and littered with chunks of flesh, goo, and an assortment of other gross odds and ends.No holds barred, there’s an extensive assortment of weaponry at your disposal, all of which offer a satisfying means drop tonnes of zombie chunks. New players are equipped with a pistol and additional weapon pickups are strewn throughout levels, although it’s a lucky dip-esque scenario, which can raise the stakes in stressful situations. Zombie mobs will occasionally drop weapons in the same fashion, too. Otherwise, character level milestones will unlock weapons that become purchasable in a shop accessed via the main menu; these can be equipped for immediate use at the start of any game.As well as weapons, cosmetic items are available for purchase in the shop. The range includes: hairstyles, accessories, and colours to dye the aforementioned. These are fun additions, though be weary of durability; nothing lasts forever!The number of character customisation and playstyle options may seem overwhelming, but they provide a welcome sense of autonomy. Players can alter their character’s dexterity and abilities via a vast skill tree, accruing skill points to invest upon levelling up. Opting for certain skill pathways will lock you out of others, to prompt roles or specialties (support/damage/and so on); this is especially important for multiplayer sessions, where survivability is reliant on teamwork. Re-rolling your skill points is available at a small cost, thankfully, which offers an incredible level of flexibility (or the means to fix any mistakes from trigger-finger clicking).Zombie Grinder stands out in a market saturated with pixel art titles; a lot of care and time has gone into crafting assets that are very easy on the eyes. It’s especially impressive that nothing seems entirely flat, or flush to a set plane, as can be the case with this art-style. Instead, props, characters, and settings possess a satisfying level of depth with respect to one another.(Noticing and appreciating this is purely pedantic on my part, but it’d be a shame for it to go without recognition all the same.)A friend recommended buying Zombie Grinder on a whim, as we’ve been searching for multiplayer games worthy of our time and money. Still being in development, I was initially hesitant, but upon purchase and our first play session, I was taken aback by the polish and playability it offered. Surprising still, the game isn’t complete, and yet the standard has been set so high! Ultimately, that’s what compelled me to write this review, as I have nothing but praise for this work-in-development."

I love this game, Im not sure why so many people are disappointed in it. Before I bought it I had writen a post on the forums and the dev got back to me same say I posted to let me know this is a keyboard controlled game. ITS NOT BAD though. Ive played some dreadful keyboard only games and this is not one of those. You can even use your mouse in the menu, and can customize your key bindings to make it more suited for your play style.That being said, the game play is great! Its a great arcade type game you can play with your friends, others, or by yourself. Top down shooter that has great RPG elements. As you level up you can go in and unlock skills  for your character, you can buy stylish dogs for them, I went with kitty ears, and can color them how you like. You can upgrade your guns, ammo, turrets, ect.Theres so many types of gameplay you can do as well. The normal arcade play through mode, wave, dungeon crawlers, even in an actual dungeon with traps, ect.I took a risk and bought this game unsure if Id like it but its been a great one to play with friends, Several of us got it and have already played it several hours."

There are a few major buts, tho.First of all, there are no players online. There was literally zero games available to join, and when I hosted a game, one person just briefly came and went... The game would be so much more fun with a good amount of players, but as it stands it's not worth it.Second, there are some... bugs, dare I say? It is possible make your equipment completely unusable by socketting wrong gems into it (reducing ammo capacity for laser cannon and reducing durability for 100% or more for any gun). I tell you, when you put a million gold's worth of gems into a weapon just to realize you can't use it, it ruins your mood for a while...All considering, if you have a decent sized group of friends to play with, you're gonna have a good time.

Theres not much to it expect shoot em all with campaign or other people with a lot of unlockable stuff. Its a nice addition that it has quite a lot of varities of zombies but it doesn't really help when you got a gun that can kill anything on its path. I haven't visited the workshop so I am not sure how great the community is but they seem rather friendly from my gameplay expirience on servers. The game just feels too much of cosmetics and less emphasis on shooting up zombies. I doubt theres not much to add on to its shooting criteria. If you like simple top down shooters with a lot of collectibles its okayish in my opinion as I really love collectibles in games but its doesn't do alot of justice in the gameplay aesthetics."

This amount of ♥♥♥♥ery would not be reasonable if games on steam were required to be completed to be release. This allows the game to continually pump in that moneeeey!!!

Make a run option. Zombie types should be explained before the game starts...maybe in an intro thing...Also, the objectives aren't made clear. I make it to the end of a map, but turns out the game thinks I need to go to a gun shop. Obviously I'm fine without the gun shop if I made it to the end of the level already. Overall, a little annoyed. It's an okay purchase, I just hope they make it better. Also, there should be an open world type thing, be able to enter a building and defend it or something. Or maybe create buildings where you want, enter, and defend those. This is just a game where you walk around and shoot zombies, which gets real boring, real fast. There should also be checkpoints within the levels. Maybe be able to upgrade level things while in-game. Zombies should have tiny health bars above their heads.. All the info that's displayed on the corner is tiny, I don't know when my gun is about to run out of ammo, there should be ammo crates and food on the ground, instead of having to buy it all... Gets repeatitive fast...maybe it's because I got a headache right now...but somehow I feel betrayed by the video, because it seemed better. Cool assests...but all that goes to waste if the game isn't executed in a smooth way..but other than all that...I'd say it's worth it on sale. Which I got it for like $4.

Basicly its a wave survival game, since the campaign is very short and meaningless.  As of right now the game does show some good potential, but there are a few changes the developers need to make before I give this game a positive review.The first problem is that the game is bugged.  The game features a neat weapon leveling system in which the player must find gems to level up their guns.  You can buy guns with the gold that zombies drop and put the gems that you find as a rare drop from zombies in the gun to make it stronger.  I bought a flare gun and maxed it out on gems, which is time consuming.  Well guess what, the flare gun wont reload.  I tried filling it up with an ammo crate, still nothing.  I spammed the reload button over and over again, still nothing.  I didn't think much of it until a few weapons later I tried to do the same thing with a turret.  SUPRISE* I can't use them. All of those gems that I spent hours getting were put to an absolute WASTE. The bug officially trolled me, and the deveolopers of the game are sitting on their lazy asses as this game progresses into nothingness (since only 10 players are actually playing at any given moment).The second problem is that the campaign is mind numbingly boring, short, and lazy.  The campaign features zombies that you can fight in any wave survival round, so the campaign is literally pointless to play.  Upon completing the campaign you notice that you will recieve no special items and pretty much unlock nothing.  There are only three levels to the campaign which is an absolute joke, since there is hardlly any extra content.  The boss you fight at the end is way too easy and is an abomination of lazy graphics.  Wtf is it, a zombie head star fish?  This campaign is a lazy joke.The third problem is the rare items.  You will be playing the game and all of the sudden somone will join your game with a crazy overpowered weapon.  How did they get these weapons?  Well go ahead and ask them and they wont really be able to tell you.  One response I recieved was, ""I just woke up one day, logged on, and I had it.""  Upon further inspection the game will give you a rare item for no reason on a daily basis.  This means you aren't rewarded for making it far in their randomly generated dungeons, yeah if you get to the 40th level of their dungeon, you still wont find a rare indestructable item.  To get the item you want, you can only sit back and hope that the next day you will recieve it randomly. (BUT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT YOU WILL JUST RECIEVE A PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥BUCKET OF NEVER ENDING PAINT OR A TOP HAT) ***this game is trolling me**** FML  The last weapon I recieved was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grenade with a faster reload speed. x_x  Any respectable loot system would allow these weapons to be found in game, instead its a just a trashy gimick to get players to log on every day.Until the devs read this comment and fix some of these issues.  I am going to vote the game a negative score.  What a mess and a heap of bad descisions.  The content is lazy, so prepare yourself for a game that is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"
