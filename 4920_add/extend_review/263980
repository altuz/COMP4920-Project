Ignore the cheesy chip tune (or turn it off in the options), ignore the shooter game it starts with, because in a sudden twist you'll find yourself in a platformer with a teleport gun that handles arcade style: no blue and orange portals, just straight up teleports and precision jumps that let you reach where you want to reach, provided you can figure out and make the jumps.Don't pass this one by while it's on sale."

After the first 20 minutes I had to admit that the game is quite entertaining and after seeing the ending I didn't even notice that I've played it for over an hour.Sure the (retro-style) pixel graphics and the 16-bit sound seem to be standard for every second indie game, but in 'Out There Somewhere' they do their job quite good, they made me feel a bit nostalgic and are very charming (I really like this music in the main menu). The portal gun and the different puzzles are well done and I seriously had to think sometimes how to solve this room. Green, red and blue light beams, jumping, momentum - there are several things to consider when shooting that little bullet.Yeah it is a short game with a short 'story' (the bad guy shoots at me, my ship crashes and I have to explore the planet to finally kill the bad guy. All of this because of... reasons!) and a length of approximately one hour for the first playthrough. However during this short period I've been entertained well and it never felt repetitive. In addition there are many interesting achievements that bring in some replay value, so I'd say it's definitly worth this small price and I have to admit: Developers, you've done a really nice job!"

The title grabbed my attention, and so I just had to try it.What else could I buy for 19 cents anyway?I can't think of many other things, and certainly not something that could keep me entertained for several hours like this little gem did.What is it about?Out there somewhereis a short 2D puzzle-platformer with a few simple but interesting mechanics. For me personally, it feels like a mash-up ofPortal,The SwapperandYou Have to Win the Game, which is a good thing because I like all of those games.You take a role of Yuri - the space cop, who tries to protect the mothership from a bad guy Grigori. Your ship was shot down and crashed on an unknown planet. Now you have to find missing parts, repair your shuttle and face Gregori once again…GameplayAlthough the very first segment of the game is a classic arcade-machine-style space shooter, don't be fooled. The whole gameplay is based onjumping around with teleportation gun, solving puzzles. How it works is, you fire ""teleshots"" and you are instantly teleported the moment they hit the surface. Your telegun also stores your momentum, which is another important little mechanic to keep in mind. There are obviously different surfaces, obstacles and problems throughout the levels, and it's all up to you to solve.Later in game, you'll get a pew pew gun to deal with enemies if you so desire, but you can very well just avoid most of them...SidenotesPuzzles arechallenging but fun. There areplenty of checkpoints, so even if you die, it's not a major setback most of the time.Even though the visual style is simple, I really dig the concept art and the cutscenes, as well as chiptune soundtrack - it's surprisingly not as monotonous and annoying as I thought it would be. I think it all works well with the space theme, too.Not to forget, there are even some funny littleeaster eggs and referenceshere and there, and I'm always a big fan of those.Like I mentioned before,this game is short. Even taking it reaaally slow and casual, it took me only 3 hours to beat. You could very possibly manage to do your first playthrough in 90 minutes. There's even achievement for finishing the game in under 20 minutes… There'ssome replayabilitythanks to Steam achievements, but even then, you shouldn't expect endless hours of fun. On the other hand - it's a very simple game in terms of game mechanics, and it could get boring and repetitive if it took too long. I guess it depends on how you look at it. I would say it's reasonable for what it is.ConclusionWhat can I say, it's a nice little game. It requires thinking and quick reactions, and thanks to that, it can be pretty challenging. It's a kind of one-trick-pony, but well executed IMHO. I know some people might feel it's too short for the full price, butI definitely do recommend itwhen it's in sale."
,Recommended,263980,13313363,"Posted: 10 December, 2014",all,Gunderson Mallard,"Out There Somewhere is an aesthetically pleasing puzzle platformer that makes use of teleporting and various environmental obstacles. The art and gameplay are both well done, and it is a nice treat.The mechanics of the game are easy to pick up and there is an even balance between execution and solution in the puzzles (in other words, it takes some thinking as well as fast fingers). Not to be confused with a portal gun (where you make two doors and enter freely), when you fire your telegun you are teleported when your projectile hits a solid surface. There are obstacles (crumbling surfaces, mirrors, glass, some beams, and enemies) that are thrown into the mix to keep things interesting. The controls all feel solid, and, given the length, the game was fair in challenge and pacing.There is very little combat (most enemies can be avoided) and there are 3 boss fights (1 being a repeat). That being said, unless you get health upgrades, there can be some challenge in avoiding everything or killing everything.The main game is rather short if you are focused on just beating the game (my first run with very little exploration clocked in just over an hour), however I highly recommend you take the time to explore and find all the upgrades: these areas are some of the more challenging of the game. The story and dialogue feel underdeveloped, and overall I was left wanting more of the game in general, but I do not consider this a bad thing.Out There Somewhere is light on combat and easy on your backlog, but those looking for a clever puzzle platformer should check it out."

I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix.GameplayThe puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.GraphicIt's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?All inAll Out There Somewhereis a really good Indie Game!8/10 From MeSweep"

And it is well explored in the level design. I love the visuals too. Quality pixel art, very cute.The game is mostly on the easy side. I figured out the mechanics quickly and at worst I died 3 to 4 times on the hardest rooms. The bullet hell sections, however, are pretty hard! at least to me, I hate bullethell games. It is a very small part of the game, but it makes me wonder about mixing such completely different genres. Here it didn't take anything from the game but I remember feeling quite disappointed with Brutal Legends, for example, because I went in expecting to play an action fighting game in an open world and found myself playing an RTS. I don't like RTS so I couldn't enjoy the game, no matter how good it is. But I digress. This is not an issue with Out There Somewhere, the spaceship sessions are short and few.It's extremely short though. But without considering price, length is not a very useful information. What I mean by that is I think the game is worth what they are asking for it. It's a short adorable, original and fun little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich. I'm a very satisfied custommer."

I recommend this game as long as you buy it at a discount, since it's a very short game. However, it is well done, it sometimes requires some reasoning to travel through certain screens, there are several secret screens and collectables thrughout the game, and its aesthetics is overall nice.Plus: it's chocked full of sci-fi (mostly Star Trek, but not only that) references, which is always good!"
,Recommended,263980,15787823,"Posted: 11 May, 2015",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"Note: video review embedded below.There’s something untraditionally appealing about Out There Somewhere’s insubstantiality. It’s a very brief, straightforward experience, but rather than feeling shallow it uses its brevity to subvert the players expectations in interesting ways.That arcade shooting segment at the start? That’s just a prelude to the platformer that takes up most of the game. That gun you’re carrying? It’s actually for teleporting you around instead of killing enemies. The huge world the game seems to be hinting at? In reality it’s a more classical one direction platformer. Out There Somewhere is full of little touches that seemed designed to throw you off course and surprise you with how things play out. They may come at the cost of making a lasting impression, but I feel like that wasn’t ever its prerogative.Out There Somewhere also gets away with a lot more than most games could because of how strong its mechanics are, and how intrinsically they’re tied to level designs. The teleporter gun is largely your only tool throughout the game, and each screen is made to perfectly utilize it for platforming and puzzle solving (provided your reflexes are up for it). Eventually I was having to take into account bullet speed, character momentum, and environmental devices in order to navigate effectively. These additions are added quickly, but also scale the difficulty smoothly enough to where I almost didn’t realize how much more involved later levels were because the game had taught me how to play so well.One could argue that Out There Somewhere is too short or simple or loose, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. The game often feels as if it’s holding on by a thread and some frustrating moments can be a lot more unpleasant due to how much of the overall game they encompass. But its length and careful scope feel so intentional and considered that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and enjoy how it played with my expectations. I might not remember it a year or even a month from now, but as a condensed experiment in teleportation and unconventional design I don’t regret the journey.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNqcZZ-li-k&ab_channel=MrNinjaSquirrelYou can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

,Recommended,263980,15503454,"Posted: 23 April, 2015",all,krayzkrok,"This is a competent retro 8-bit platformer. But wait! What makes this particular game interesting is the teleport gun: you fire the gun, and you teleport to the point of impact. The developer makes good use of this fact for a variety of puzzles, spiced up by the fact momentum is maintained through the teleport, plus vertical light beams that have different effects on your projectile. There's also a more traditional gun, although to be honest the combat never really felt necessary, apart from a couple of puzzles. It's not that difficult to figure out a way through each room, and in fact there are occasionally different ways of doing so; the difficulty lies in the execution, but thankfully it's not that frustrating.It doesn't last very long, 90 minutes at the most, but I paid $0.19 or something so I'm hardly likely to complain.

You will assuredly not get 190 hours of this game, but you will get 2 of the most fun hours you've had gaming in a while. Buy now!As my first foray into speedrunning, this game has given me several dozen hours of entertainment beyond what would be expected by reasonable gamers. But I am trying to be unbiased, and think of this game from a casual standpoint.I still recommend it glowingly.A quirky 2D platformer with a laser-sharp, utilitarian design approach, Out There Somewhere gives you a light dash of shooting combat, a gentle hint of exploration, and a core game built around puzzle-platforming with a 2D teleport gun. It is bookended by space shooter segments that some reviewers have taken issue with - I won't argue with them for finding these segments disjunct, but I still enjoy them anyway.It is worth noting that the pace at which new mechanics are introduced is absolutely stellar - far better than many A-list titles. You get a sense for what each button does, a scenario or two that changes your approach, and then a wholly new element just as you are getting comfortable.It seems like the biggest complaint from most reviewers is the game's short length. Most people should have an easy time earning the ""Swift Success"" achievement on their first play, it's true, but the collectibles should keep completionists occupied for another hour or so after - they even require a little meta-gaming! At a two dollar price point, this is plenty of game for your buck, and it's not often that this caliber of level design, soundtrack, and art style find their way into a two-dollar title."

The music controlled the gameplay almost more than I did, forcing me in and out of situations that would seem impossible with the very sound of a note. The ""portal gun"", as one could call it, adds a new depth to the platforming which makes it fun, puzzling, and at some points infuriating.Out There Somewhere is like nothing I have played before, or as I should say, many things I have played before.

That mechanic is a teleport gun, which fires a bullet that teleports you to its point of impact. The teleport preserves your momentum as well, so if you start a jump right before you warp, you can essentially tele-walljump. Several puzzles make use of this and other neat physics tricks you can do with yourself, gradually nudging the difficulty up in a pleasant, inviting way that has you feeling clever and masterful by the end of the game. There's a little combat with enemies and a few secrets to hunt if you are so inclined, but it's a very short and sweet package... one playthrough will last you less than an hour. I certainly wish it was longer because it is very tight and fun for those 45 minutes, but what's there is more than worth playing. There's even some inklings of plot and some interaction with aliens as you traverse the odd little world, and neat opening and closing sequences that play like Gradius-style shooters. And if you really feel like sticking with it, there are a mess of oddly-grindy achievements to shoot for, though I wouldn't encourage it.

Despite this, I whole heartedly recommend this game. It's a clever little puzzle platformer that harkens back to some of the classics in the genre. The story, while short, is interesting and the music is memorable and entertaining to listen to.My only real beef is with the very plain graphics. The character sprites and the portraits are so nice, I wish that the backgrounds had some of the same attention given to them. The game just looks plain. Take a look at a game like Rex Rocket for an example of how beautiful a game like this can be. Fortunately, ""Out There Somewhere"" is saved by it's fantastic platforming, which is really all that matters anyway."
,Recommended,263980,16457879,"Posted: 16 June, 2015",all,Slowacki,"Warning: May Contains SpoilersTwo words: wasted potential!I have just finished playing Out There Somewhere and it was a really pleasant experience. However, it was a very SHORT experience indeed.Anyway, let me break it down to details and grade every aspect on its own.ConceptGame starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix.StoryNot much to say really. No history, no explanations, no nothing. Just fix your ship and welp, you're done. I mean, I didn't really expect to have a Witcher 3 in space, but for the sake of having the player become involved in the game, it really needssomething. Tell me a story of a war, rebellion maybe, invasion, whatever, but please share some details with us, not just generic 'Humanity almost extinct, Grigori attacks, protect planet' stuff. I wouldn't even need any cut scenes, just some text scrolling up with a nice background, skippable for those who don't care about such aspects of the game.GraphicsIt's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?MusicSimple, yet quite atmospheric. It reminds me of the soundtrack of Risk of Rain that is electronic sounds that just really fit the space exploration theme of the game. The musical themes change when you change a map/biome and pretty much all of them are really enjoyable.GameplayThe puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.ContentI've got only one thing to say about the content -More!. The game needs more planets, more story depth, more types of guns, more types of enemies, more collectibles, more puzzles, more bosses, more flying in space, more technical upgrades to your ship, more play time, more replayability, just literally, more of everything.Honestly, give this game a 10h playthrough time which implements new mechanisms, enemies and bosses gradually, add a decent story, raise the price accordingly and you have areally decent game!To compare, playing this game right now is like getting a new toy, figuring out how it works and suddenly, someone snaps it out of our hands. It just leaves hunger formoreOverallTo sum up, for the price you're going to get this, which is usually less than 1$, this game is totally worth it. But be warned, it literally has an hour of gameplay (exactly 53 minutes on my save file). I really hope that if the next part ever comes, it's going to have a significantly larger budget, which will allow creating a more in-depth experience with some solid (re)play value of at least 10+ hours."
76561198123412640,Recommended,263980,15472977,"Posted: 20 April, 2015",all,Sam Lilly,"Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer with simple puzzle elements. Your mission is take out Grigor, but in the battle your ship was damaged and you crash land on an unknown planet. You have to find him on the planet and take him out for good. This is mostly done by platforming. The main mechanic to get used to is the use of a portal gun. You shoot it and when the projectile hits a solid target you will be teleported to that spot. You'll learn the ins and outs of how that works, along with interacting with different beams and other obstacles that will change the way your teleportation works. There's also a gun you can use as a weapon to fight off the planet's hostile inhabitants. This gun doesn't shoot very rapidly and it's a small bullet, but this only makes it all the more useful as you need to aim carefully and plan your shots. It's simple to grasp but will test your smarts and skills as you try to get the hidden upgrades. The graphics are pixelated and dark. The visuals, along with some cool synth music, make for a nice atmosphere to travel through. There's not a whole lot more to say. Not much story, just some simple mechanics and areas to clear. It's a nice little game.There are some problems, though. All of them seem to stem from the game's legnth. It'll probably only take you 1-2 hours to beat it, and not much more for achievement hunters. That's fine story-wise, as there's not much there outside the premise. However, it seems like more could've been done with the mechanics that were set in place. More puzzles, more ideas with the mechanics, and just some more outside the box thinking. Having a longer game would also mean a larger world, with perhaps more items and powerups to collect. More bosses would've been good. There are two space shooting sections, but having more would've been nice as well. It's neat that those sections start and end the game to kind of tie it up in a nice little bow, but having more of them might make the playstyle feel a little more welcome. A map would've been nice too.Overall, this is a lighter recommendation. The game is nice with simple mechanics and intresting atmosphere, but it's rather short and could use some fleshing out. Perhaps there will be another game by the developers in a similar fashion, or maybe even a sequel to expand upon these ideas, which have a lot of potential. What's here is good, and only taking a while to beat isn't bad, but this game FEELS short. It feels like this style of game should have more to it. It's no Super Metroid, it's no Cave Story, but it's something neat that, if on sale, if worth checking out. Five dollars is a little steep for a Steam game like this, but if you can get it for a few bucks or less, consider it. Out There Somewhere gets a 6 out of 10 for being a neat little adventure that has lots of potential and a satisfying, even if short, experience."

I continued my save file after the credits rolled in disbelief that the end came that quickly.NPCs are obnoxious. Most of them have nothing important to say and just get in the way of the gameplay flow.The platforming portion of the singular boss battle can be forced to only use his first two attacks simply by getting enough (like 3) attacks off on him during each cycle. This makes for an incredibly simple boss battle that felt more like just another platforming room rather than a boss.There is no real incentive to collect the optional ship parts. The shoot-em-up section of the boss battle is doable without upgrading the ship.Spoilers:Forced cliffhanger ending where the villian is still ""Out there somewhere.""Random Thoughts:I dunno... this game really makes me wonder if the developer didn't have a strict plan for what they wanted to make. The existance of relatively numerous NPCs suggest that there was going to be more of a purpose for them. Maybe for lore/world-building purposes? There also is really weird pacing in the game... though it is difficult to describe with the game being so short. I suspect (though I should note I have no idea if this is true) that this was planned to be a longer game. It certainly feels like there should be more (again, the price is very fair for what you get), and like many others seem to be saying, this entire game feels like it should be the tutorial/intro level of a larger game... and I think that was probably the plan initially...Everything points to that theory:An abundance of NPCs most likely for world-buildingStylized artwork for textbox profiles and the rare cutsceneProgressive upgrade system for ship, which could have been spread out over the course of the game, as it felt completely unneccesary for the boss.Short to the point of it being unbelievable that the end falls where it doesSee final item on Cons.I do recommend this game because it's a great concept. I'm just disappointed that it wasn't explored further than it was. Don't get me wrong, I understand the limitations that a small team of developers can bring...

The puzzles were smart but not very complex; not that they were not enjoyable.I thought I was just starting and next thing I know, and hour or so later, I finished the game. I was a disappointed, especially considering how highly I regarded the game. It showed so much promise.Then I went to the store page and saw that the game is actually 1$.

The art grabbed my attention, as did the very positive reviews, so I checked it out. Here's what I think:PROS--------------------------------------------- Excellent gameplay (it's so cool that people are *still* finding new things to do with platformers. I love it! ^_^ )- Tight controls. I never felt overwhelmed, and that's a good thing.- Great art! (though I'm not sure why the backgrounds were moving underground - maybe to keep things visually interesting >_< )- The tone, feel and setting are all really good.- The pacing is just incredible. I started playing it saying, 'I'll just play it for a little while', and the game moves at such a pace that I found myself playing for far longer than I thought. I beat the game in two sittings! I love games that can grab your attention and keep it like that.- The characters and puzzles kept me glued to my chair. I tell ya - there's something great about this game. Once you start - you don't want to put the game down!- Frequent checkpoints that enforce the fact that you're always making progress.- I also really like the fact that the last boss, while challenging is not SUPER-HARD-OH-MY-GOSH-YOU'LL NEVER-BEAT-THIS that so many platformers end with. While challenging, the game is more fun than hard - and I like that a lot.CONS----------------------------------------- The music, while good, never really connected with me. I still listen to the 'Shovel Knight' and 'Super Mario 3D World' soundtracks, for example. But here, nothing really jumped out. The music is not bad - it just didn't stand out to me.- While the controls felt fair, there were a few parts that I thought the difficulty curve was a bit steep. Reflecting back on it, I think it's because the devs wanted to put in as many different puzzles in as small a time frame as possible. I never got stuck or had to look solutions up online (which is great!), but smoothly transitioning from one puzzle to another sometimes felt a little weird. Maybe that's a nitpick. Just thought I'd mention it.- At a little over two hours, the game is *short*. What it lacks in length, it more than make up for in variety and fun, though.OVERALL----------------------------------------I was really pleasantly surprised with 'Out There Somewhere'. The pacing was excellent, the art was really fun and quirky and the platforming action kept me coming back for more (and kept showing me things I'd never seen before - so I loved that). I loved the fact that I went into this 'blind', so everything it showed me was a surprise. Love it! I had a great time and I look forward to seeing what else the devs have made. Bring on more great games! :)FINAL SCORE---------------------------------------8.5 out of 10"

The puzzles are devious but well designed and it's fun to use the teleport beam in clever ways. Some of the moves are pretty tricky to pull off with some very strict timing required and might be frustrating to inexperienced players. An experienced platformer player might get through this in about an hour- there's an achievement for speed-running it in less than 20 minutes and I managed to do it in 15 after some practice. At full price this is a good buy- at 19p in the sales, it's a no-brainer."

The only other gripe is it is a little short, and you dont really need to collect any of the power upgrades to complete the game, they just make the final level a bit easier.The puzzle platforming is pretty light and you should not find the game too frustrating, although some areas can be a little taxing.

At the price listed, it's really not.The game throws you onto an alien world in a story that tries to be more than it is. If this game is part of a series, something would be explained, but on its own it is unremarkable. The big hook to the game is that you have a teleporting gun that allows you to warp to wherever you hit with the gun. You retain your momentum, so much like Portal you encounter some interesting puzzles. The puzzles are seldom difficult, with the only real difficulty coming from the imprescision you deal with. Occasionally you'll encounter something where you have to think in order to proceed, but I got through these by just shooting and somehow ending up where I needed to be.There is a secondary weapon that damages enemies as well. It was a good choice to introduce this weapon, as it does introduce some variety in the gameplay. However, the weapon never quite ""feels"" right. It's hard to explain. Combat, for what there is of it, feels frustrating, especially when you fail later in the room and have to do it over again. Still, having the gun does add to the gameplay.When you die, you respawn quickly. This is good since you will want to try again quickly, but sometimes it can lead to you dying 2 or 3 times in a row because you're still moving when you spawn. This futher compounds the difficulty of a particularly tough puzzle.The game lasts about 45 minutes. I enjoyed most of my time with it, and there are some interesting obstacles introduced throughout, but I did find myself wishing things would get mixed up a little more towards the end, or just wanting the game to end.Overall, there's a lot of potential here. The teleporter gun brings some neat ideas, and the environments are well built around the mechanic. And it's worth the price at 96% off. It's a nice little game, that shows that the developer has a lot of upward potential for their next games."

The puzzles are bothe simple and yet confusing for a first time through and yet when you figure it out you will be wondering how you couldn't see the solution earlier if i could nitpick one thing it's that there is no way to turn off the tutorials if you intend on a second playthrough.

Since then, I've played through the game several more times to explore, collect, and just speed through it. Out There Somewhere doesn't do much, I'll say that. However, what it does, it does VERY well. I'm still thirsting for more.The controls for the game felt tight and I had no issues with moving, shooting, or jumping (I use a controller). Not once did I feel like I could blame the game for falling or dying. It was just a matter of getting faster with the timing, or better at positioning.As far as sound goes, the music is incredibly well done. There are several tracks in the game that change as you progress through the different areas. A few of the tracks are just mindblowingly good for how small the game is. As for sound effects, there aren't an awful lot, but they aren't ear grating which is nice.Aesthetically, the game looks wonderful. If the audio wasn't enough to tell you that Cave Story was an inspiration, the visuals will help remind you. I find the graphics to be very pleasing and easy on the eyes, and it's very easy to tell the different mechanics apart so the puzzles don't feel as frustrating to figure out.Finally, the gameplay. The gameplay is very basic. You can run, you can shoot your portal, and you can shoot your gun. Not much else to it, but that isn't a bad thing. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, either, but there is definitely a learning curve to them. My first time playing, I'd take a few minutes to figure out some of the puzzles. In later playthroughs, it's fun to see just how fast you can get through the puzzles that had stumped you before. Just because the puzzles aren't overly difficult doesn't detract from how rewarding it is to solve them.Overall, the game is very well done. For just $0.20, I'd say it's absolutely worth it. Even for $5.00, I'd say it's worth it if you plan to play through the game multiple times, trying to complete it. Out There Somewhere was a surprising hit, and I'm absolutely glad that I purchased it."

You have to explore a weird planet in order to be able to launch your ship into space (again). The controls are very simple - you only get to use 3 buttons (teleport gun, jump and gauss gun), other than the directional ones, throughout the entire game - but that's more than enough in order to tackle the game's puzzles, enemies and areas.Most of the areas require a bit of thinking, and in some cases, reflexes, in order to reach the ""end"" of the screen and get to the next one. Every screen represents an entirely different area you need to pass.Out There Somewhere is challenging enough for gamers of all ages and levels, but at the same time, you will never feel frustrated, even if you fail to overcome a certan obstacle in several attempts.

Pacing seems great with new mechanics introduced slowly, once gotten hang of the momentum mechanic controls feel tight and music makes you want to keep going even after several deaths.Only negative may be that it's an hour experience, for some it may not feel like worthwhile to give money, but there's something great about beating game in single day and it's freaking cheap!Shout out to awesome soundtrack as well:https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Kun Steamissa oli kesäalennukset, päätin muuten vain ostella paljon 19 sentin pelejä. Sanomattakin melkein kaikki niistä oli... keskivertoa huonompia ja suurimmasta osasta tyydyin saamaan kortit, mutta tämä peli oli mukava poikkeus tähän.Kun avasin pelin huomasin sen olevan hyvin viimeisen päälle kiillotettu indie tasohyppely pulmapeli. Se ei tarjoa mitään maata räjäyttävää tai kiiltävää, mutta koska kaikki tuntuu, näyttää ja kuulostaa erittäin hyvältä, se piti minut kiinnostuneena. Pelin tahti tuntuu hyvältä ja uusia mekaniikkoja tulee hitaalla tahdilla vastaan, kun vauhtimekaniikkaan pääsee sisälle kontrollit tuntuvat tiukoilta ja musiikki pitää pelissä vaikka olisi juuti kuollut muutamaan kertaan.Ainoa negatiivinen asia taitaa olla että se on todellakin vain tunnin mittainen, joka voi joillekin olla ehkä liian pieni kokemus josta pitäisi maksaa, mutta se tunne että pääsee pelin läpi yhdessä päivässä on erittäin mukava ja se on järkyttävän halpaa!Myös maininta mahtavalle pelin soundtrackille:https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases"

,Recommended,263980,17011134,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,Nighthawk,"PresentationOut There Somewhere is possibly one of the most challenging, unique and intriguing platformers you'll ever play, as it puts you in control of a little alien, stranded on an unknown planet after his ship has crashed as a result of a space battle between him and his nemesis, Grigori, who ended up on the same planet as you, changing the lives of the planet's inhabitants. With that being said, you'll soon be on your way to recover the core needed for your ship to function again and finish what you've started, but to do so you'll have to traverse a long way, filled with danger, friendly and foe aliens and plenty of secrets. While the intelligent life on the planet will mostly only complain about how Grigori has influenced their lives since his arrival, and occasionally open a door for you or give you a hint to where you should head next, the more barbaric enemies simply known as monsters will often stand between you and your next objective, forcing you to think up different strategy on the move. While the plot isn't the most unique one and it certainly doesn't have any twists along the way, it is pleasing to see how many different areas and secrets you can find along the way, some which will often lead to items that will make your journey easier, such as abandoned cores or ancient alien artifacts. There is a certain lack of character development when it comes to the intelligent aliens, which will only interact with you with the same line of dialogue, which in most cases doesn't make any sense.Rating: 7GameplayAs any platformer you'll want to play, gameplay is the key element for an unforgettable experience, and in this aspect, Out There Somewhere brings some interesting concepts to the table, such as the teleport gun which allows you to send a beam to any wall that will teleport you there once it reaches its destination. As that mechanic alone would soon run out of challenging situations, blue, red and green beams will make puzzles more difficult, as red beams will block your teleportation beam, blue beams will stop the gun's beam at their location, and green beams will send it upwards. Combing those simple mechanics with the machine gun that will allow you to shoot enemies in your path in addition to using the teleport gun creates situations that are challenging, yet fun to solve and think your way out of. Secrets are also an important part of the experience, as exploration is rewarded with items such as health upgrades or the machine gun upgrade that allows you to shoot faster, and looking for different alternatives out of a certain screen will often take you to a completely new one with a new challenge ahead. The most important thing is that the game allows you to play however you want to, as you can avoid shooting enemies completely, making your way forward using the teleport gun alone, or take your time, explore the world around you and make sure you collect everything along the way.Rating: 8GraphicsOut There Somewhere goes for an old school look, with simple, low resolution textures formed out of squares, and while that art style fits the concept of the game fairly well, the problem comes in the form of repetition using those textures, as each screen will look similar to the previous one, and even when you do reach an area that's meant to feel and look different such as Grigori's Tower, it still feels like the same square with a different color shade on top.Rating: 6.5AudioThe audio quality is pretty cheap, which isn't necessarily a problem since there isn't much to hear aside from the effects that will only show up when you command them to. The soundtrack is okay for this time of game, but it does get boring pretty quickly, but since there isn't much else to hear aside from the background song, you could just mute it and play your own tunes.Rating: 5.5ExtrasIt will probably take you around one hour to complete Out There Somewhere for the first time, but just as a note the game can be completed in less than 15 minutes, and the game even encourages you to do that as it has a specific achievement. You could play it a second time to earn all the achievements and see the secret areas you might have missed, but afterwards that's it.Rating: 6VerdictOut There Somewhere is a cute, challenging adventure to spend your afternoon with, as long as you don't mind the fact that it will be over fairly soon, but for its low price and a possible secondary replay, it's worth a try.Rating Overall: 6.6Check out the full review and a lot more about Out There Somewhere athttp://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=357"
,Recommended,263980,15564660,"Posted: 26 April, 2015",all,Tejan,"The game feels a lot like a student project more than a completed video game.The story is almost non-existant, all you know is that you crash land on a planet and need to defeat some Russian named fellow.The gameplay, while decent, feels very unoriginal. Sure the idea of a gun that teleports you to where it hits seems novel at first, but the game doesn't really do much to challenge the player with the ideas presented by the gun. Also, the only real areas that feel like you would benefit from understanding the game's mechanics are, oddly enough, the first few screens. You can shave off, roughly, 15 seconds there by using teleport and jumps and just knowing how the jumping as a whole works.The absolute worst part of the game is the beginning and ending SHUMP sections though. The devs must not have known how to make a very good SHUMP because what they put forth was one of the worst I've ever experienced. The ship has can take several hits, which is nice because the hit detection can be a little wonky, but there's a lot of things that are just plain wrong. There's no invulnerablity at all after being hit in the ship, which means if you move incorrectly and get hit once you aren't given any time to regroup, you need to go into full panic mode. This also leads to another interesting glitch, which is also present in the normal sections of the game, if you get hit by something that explodes you take three hearts of damage. Be it a plane or missile in the SHUMP sections or the big monster's explosive shots. On the brightside, this allows you to finish the opening SHUMP section in 3 seconds as you only need to crash onto the planet and not beat the Russian guy.The game is a good pickup if it's really cheap, because you won't be able to squeeze much more than 4 hours out of it, assuming you're attempting to 100% it, and those 4 hours will definitely not involve you being fully engrossed by the game.If you want a Metroidvania game with more depth I recommend the Shantae games or Guacamelee."

The game's mostly based around the teleportation gun mechanic, which lends itself well to a lot of neat puzzles and platforming. Momentum is conserved through jumping so you can use it to gain extra height on a jump and get places you otherwise wouldn't be able to. Even in the small game world there's a ton of secrets tucked away and collecting them all does give you a health boost (and ship boost at the end of the game). It's really quite fun and the game does a lot even with its short length to keep things varied and interesting.

He must free the planet's citizens, find a power source to get his ship to work again and defeat Grigori for good.GameplayThe game revolves mostly around teleporting which is done via your teleporting gun (It's nothing like portal's portal gun).You get teleported the moment your bullet hits a wall and you depending on your timing you can jump after teleporting which can help you reach otherwise unreachable locations and it makes up for really clever platforming.The movement and shooting once you obtain your Gauss gun really remind me of Cave Story which is a good thing.You can also collect 3 Alien artifacts with each one making you more durable to damage.Pros.+Great pixelated art+Great music+Alot of replay value+Memorable protagonist+Fluid Gameplay.+Alot of secret collectibles.Cons.-Really shortFinal Verdict9.6/10"

Unlike Portal, however, you can teleport basically anywhere you can think of, leading to a bunch of fun exploration and discovery.

,Recommended,263980,19375927,"Posted: 29 November, 2015",all,TheDeluxeTux,"Out There Somewhere is an absolutely charming platformer that I highly recommend as an essential addition to any Steam user's library.  Much like Shovel Knight or Momodora, this is a modern game that looks and plays like one of the classics.The game's hero is a fighter pilot who is shot down during an epic space battle.  After crash-landing on a volcanic planet populated with friendly talking snails and strange tree-men, he ventures off, armed with a teleportation gun, to repair the ship and rejoin the battle.  Along the way, there's a few health upgrades and maybe even a weapon or two to help survive the baddies; there's also 11 hidden ship upgrades to find.While the platforming elements and the game's retro aesthetic are both great, the real star of the show is the teleportation mechanic.  Your primary trigger fires a slow-moving bolt of energy that instantly transports your character to the point of contact when a surface is struck.  Using this competently is necessary for getting through the game.  The really exciting bit, though, is the teleportation gun conserves momentum, just like Portal; beginning a leap just before your energy bolt hits something, for instance, means you'll still be traveling upwards after being teleported.  Mastering this makes for very satisfying gameplay, and abusing this mechanic to go as high or as far as you possibly can also lead you to secret areas or shortcuts that you wouldn't otherwise find.This game isn't very long, and while it's not a total cakewalk, the level of challenge is relatively low.  My first playthrough took about 90 minutes, and that was with a lot of optional exploration and puzzle-solving.  My second playthrough was a 100% playthrough, and took a little over an hour.  After learning the game's layout and mechanics, a speedrun will take not much more than 15 minutes.However, while not long, this game is really quite fun, and totally worth the very reasonable asking price.  Give it a shot, you won't regret it."

It is pleasing to look at but it can be too dark even with your brightness all the way up. If they just did a lighting overhaul it would go a long way.Story - 6/10, there isn't really a whole lot of story to this game. Basically you are on a space ship when aliens attack it, so naturally you go and fight them. You are overwhelmed and crash into an alien planet. You need to find a power core to get of the planet. During the game you hear from a few different NPC's that Grigori is a monster and they wish he wasn’t around, you also hear also hear he has that power core you need. So you take off on a mission to kill Grigori and get the power core.Gameplay - 9/10, while I want to say that this game has perfect gameplay, I can't. I personally feel that the beginning and ending space battles are unnecessary; I feel these two scenes are completely different from the rest of the game.

Many of them require quick timing, especially the later ones.  By the end of the game, it leaves you feeling very clever, and with a great feeling of accomplishment.And this is what got me super excited when after beating the game I went back and played through a second time, and suddenly realized there were a ton of new areas/secrets that I could now reach. Areas I could have reached all along, if I had only known the techniques before.There is actually still a secret I have yet to be able to reach, as I am playing without looking at any guides. I think I have figured out how to do it, but it requires amazing split-second timed jumps and shots.

It doesn't waste any time with overlong exposure and gets right down to the good stuff, mainly controls, animations and characters. The tiles aren't the prettiest though i wouldn't call the game ugly by any means. Animations and music give it a very good athmosphere.It focuses less on action, combat or powerups, and more on puzzles with a healthy serving of platforming. Climb everything and explore everywhere! It somewhat resembles Cave Story, but with fewer monsters (at least initialy) and less fighting. It has it's share of cutesy aliens and quirky characters, though the stories cannot be compared.The only downside is that there's no difficulty options and that it's not a very long game. I finished it in about an hour, but i enjoyed it. It's not brutaly easy but it's quite forgiving, which could be a good thing if you rage easily.I don't know why you're not playing this game. It's mix of puzzles and platforming requires some skill and feels rewarding. I'll admit that it doesn't look like a winner just by looking at the trailer & screenshots, but it's solid.Yes, recommended."

It'll take you about 2 hours to beat the first time but it was so good I played it until I got all the achievements.I feel like everything this game does is good. The teleporting mechanics are on point, the graphics are very good if a bit too dark for my liking, the level design is very competent, the game provides a decent challenge and it's very rewarding to try and speedrun it.If I had to complain about something, the side-scrolling bits at the beginning and the end, while justified story-wise, feel a bit out of place. Although they are competent and don't feel rushed.I've seen some people say it's too short but I didn't find that a problem. I often get quite disappointed with games that overstay their welcome by adding more and more mechanics that end up not feeling coherent with the main mechanics of the game. That's the problem I had with Portal 2 over the original Portal and I would say Out There Somewhere falls on the side of Portal: it has few mechanics that work very well and that are exploited as much as possible through the course of the game. All the mechanics that get added through the course of the game complement the main teleporting mechanic and get used from that point onwards.Overall, for its price, it's a must to have in your library.

,Recommended,263980,17838759,"Posted: 1 September, 2015",all,Taiyo Gamer,"Out There Somewhere is a platformer/shooter game in which you find yourself crash landed on a distant planet far from your home world. At first it may seem to be more along the lines of an ""R-Type""-esque scrolling shooter, but that only lasts for a moment. Stranded, you need to find a new power core for your space ship so you may return from being ""Out There Somewhere"".The gameplay is simple to grasp but it has several nuances that require a great deal of practice in order to master. Using the WASD keys you move your character back and forth, and you use the x and c button to shoot your portal gun and use something else found later in the game ( no need to spoil that ). While the controls at first may seem a bit wonky (nor is there an option to remap the keys), with a little time it is not hard to get used to them.Your teleporter gun will be your main mode of transportation and movement. While the game is inspired by Portal, instead of using the one end spits out another end, your teleporter gun changes your location to match where the bullet hits a wall. One of the cool mechanics surrounding this is that your momentum before you teleport is maintained after the teleport, allowing you to jump just before impact to scale walls you normally would not be able to get over.The music in the game is a pleasent albeit repetitive set of chiptunes, each unique area having its own sound. There is an option to turn off the music present in the main settings (along with various in-game sounds).Story is minimal at best, and history is presented through both the visuals and interactions you will have the inhabitants of this planet.Gameplay: 9Music: 8Story: N/AMechanics/Controls: 9Overall: 8.75/10The game itself is very solid although it is very short, at $5 it is definitely worth the look.

While it doesn't approach the sadistic difficulty of ""Super Meat Boy,"" for example, you will need to become increasingly agile and plan ahead in each room as the game progresses.While the core game length is shorter than I had hoped, there are a lot of hidden items to try to collect or you can try to best your speedrun time on another run-through."

As you play you are slowly taught the many tricks to beating this game. However, excepting the gun upgrade, you can perform all of those tricks from the very beginning (and have to for some of the hidden treasures). There is a story, but it is intentionally ignorable.

Decided to try it a bit and I instantly fell in love to the art style and music; it felt so nostalgic, like something from the NES era.Out There Somewhere is a puzzle platformer game. The puzzle is on how you get to that side of the screen. To do it, you'll need to think, plan, and execute it with perfect timing which most of the time will require several tries to get it right. There are diverse mechanics in the game and it is combined in later areas to make challenging puzzles. What I really like is how the game made you understand the mechanic without long or complex tutorial. The game will just say ""If you do X then Y."" After that, the game will throw you a simple puzzle that revolve around that one mechanic. Some other time the game won't even tell anything; you just found yourself in a new area with some element you never see before. The area's goal is to make you familiar with a new gameplay mechanic without even telling you it's there. That is what other game needs to copy.The game is rather short. I beat the story (not 100%) in under 1 hour (58 minutes to be exact). I was surprised when the credit rolls because I really really really want to play more. Yes, this game is that good. The story itself is really underdeveloped. It's like the developer just need an excuse for player to go to the end game.

It's a pretty simple platformer but the twist is the teleport gun you get, it shoots like an ordinary gun and you'll be teleported to where it hits instantly with all of your momentum preserved. It flows really well making the movement of the game extremely fluid. You also get a 'Guass Gun' which is basically just a pew pew that kills enemies and breaks blocks. There are a few NPCs with a little bit of inane dialogue, and collectables littered across the landscape which - a majority of them - are puzzles. I played the entire game with the controller and it worked perfectly, haven't tried it with a keyboard though and quite frankly I don't want to.Level Design - 9/10:Level Design - or essentially the Puzzles - are all pretty great but most are based on timings and not necessarily using any logic, there are some red herrings with some of the puzzles but generally there are more 'jumping puzzles' than 'actual puzzles'. There are different types of blocks you'll encounter while you progress through the game like Glass, Mirrors, and Broken Blocks that spice it up a little, but I won't go into detail as it is a puzzle platformer after-all. Finally, there are enemies, all of which are pretty stupid, the AI is kind of dumb and mostly set up in way where they are only required to do one action. Don't expect to be doing any combat in this Platformer! The world itself is pretty cool though, coupled with the secrets and collectables it - partially - rewards exploration, I would have liked it if they made exploration more rewarding and beat off the linear path every so often with more easter eggs.Audio - 7/10:The music is pretty great, it's an 8-bit Techno-Sci-Fi style and fits in the game perfectly, the soundtrack of this game is excellent. Unfortunately that's about it though, sound wasn't used as well as it could have been and there's no voice acting with the dialogue...Graphics - 7/10:The graphics, which you can probably gather from the screenshots or from my gameplay footage are a dark, pixel art style, it reminds me of Risk of Rain, whilst I'm not the biggest fan of pixel art - as I normally feel that it's more of the lazy way out of the graphics situation - it does fit in with the game nicely.Overall - 8.0/10:A bloody great platformer that I thoroughly enjoyed playing! If you're a fan of puzzle platformers then Out There Somewhere definitely needs to be in your Steam Library. I completed it in about an 1 and 1/2 hours - but not 100% collectables/achievements. I did feel that it may have been a tad too easy though... I like my Platformers to be challenging!"

But after a fight with him, his space ship gets badly damaged and both land on a same planet. Main gameplay begins here and you have to find a light orb to fix your ship and defeat Grigori for good.Gameplay is really nice. you have a teleport gun which is frequently used in the game and nearly all of the puzzles must be solved with it and a gauss gun to kill enemies. After progressing further in the game, you will encounter new enemies, three types of lightbeams, mirrors, breakable objects and moving platforms which add to the challenge.PROS:- Nice gameplay- Great soundtrack- Collectables affect how much hard the last fight will be- Can 100% the game easily with a little skill and patienceCONS:- Short (Can be completed in 14 mins to 75 mins on first playthrough)- You HAVE to lose in the first encounter with Grigori and you can even lose at the beginning; but it's not clear. So you do your best to take him down and after a lot of minutes you find out it was a complete waste of time.- Some rare achivement problems: One of the achievement did not unlock until I did it's required action for the third time.VERDICT:This game is really nice and definitely worths trying but it's short and after you unlock every achievement, you may not want to play it anymore."

Also this game have so many dead traps. I ragequit several times during this game, because that stupid teleport laser. But I still recommend this game? Why?

,Recommended,263980,17474437,"Posted: 10 August, 2015",all,Lintire,"Out There Somewhere is a 2014 platformer developed by unknown studio Miniboss. Another in a long line of Super Metroid lookalikes, it's enjoyed some success mainly due to being incredibly cheap.But rather then simply riding on the coattails of Super Metroid (or Knytt, as it were), Out There Somewhere proves to be an enjoyable linear puzzle platformer, with a teleportation mechanic that features conservation of momentum similar to Portal (though the two have no real similarity beyond that).  It's no metroidvania by any stretch of the imagination - most of the ""upgrades"" are for an endgame effect that doesn't amount to much, and outside of that venture there's a total of 5 collectibles.Instead of playing a retro pixel wannabe, I played a well-paced linear adventure, that nevertheless isn't perfect.Most of the pacing is due to just how short it is - a playthrough won't run you longer than an hour (15 minutes if you know what you're doing) and the sheer lack of enemy variety becomes apparent on subsequent playthroughs. Add to that, that while the sprites are well designed and look quite nice on inspection (thankfully, not using the retro clause of pixel art to turn out subpar product) the very poorly handed tiling and lack of visual noise make the game's art look much more amateur than it really is.This is most readily apparent during the intro and outro space battles. With a closer look, you can see the spaceships slowly rotating, the metal sheens and the sci fi aesthetic shining through, when taken as a whole it looks so empty and barren that you could mistake it for a first-year highschooler's Game Maker project.These aren't particularly pressing issues; Out There Somewhere suffers from a lack of talking points. This isn't a particularly interesting game, and for all the secrets thrown into its linear world or the cool design of the protagonist, if this game hadn't gone for 20 cents then I wouldn't be recommending it. I wouldn't have even bought it. I've played Newgrounds games with more lasting value.At $5, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're the type that goes for 100% completion. At the ridiculous sales price, I fully recommend Out There Somewhere as a snack-sized short romp to pace out the larger, more memorable videogames."

Eventually your spaceship will take damage and will crash at a planet. Your ship got torn apart and you will have to find the missing ship pieces around the planet. Your only weapon is some ""teleport"" gun which will teleport you at the location of your projectile if it hits a wall. Sometimes a quick response time is required to beat a certain area.The game has puzzles.Save stations are around the level and they will heal you.You don't have a map.Music is okay.Graphics is retro.Game is really short. (There is an achievement, complete the game within 20 minutes).Monsters will respawn if you have left the screen.Other things.To make teleport even more useful, I will recommend use a small hop first so that you are able to jump again once the protectile hit the wall and you will fly higher.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10"

(There is an achievement for 20-minute completion for speedrunners.)Figuring out how to use the teleportation gun to solve each room---as well as discover secrets for the more observant---is very satisfying both to solve and to execute.There isn't much of a story here, but I don't think you'll care about that too much.

,Recommended,263980,21898467,"Posted: 17 March, 2016",all,TheTitaniumDragon,"Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer game which would have fit right in back on the NES. While the graphics are probably a bit better than what would have been around back then in some places, on the whole this is a pixel graphics game whose gameplay harkens back to a much simpler time.You play Yuri, a space cop in hot pursuit of Grigori, some sort of bad guy. You start out trying to shoot down his ship, fail, and then have to travel across the planet to confront him and collect a light orb to repower your ship and beat him down in the end-game.The game is very simple. It claims to be inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal, but honestly it is its own thing, and not very much like any of those games. It is very linear, there isn’t much of a plot, and it is very centered around its central game mechanic – a teleportation gun.When Yuri fires his gun, he gets teleported to wherever it hits, with whatever momentum he presently has being preserved. He cannot teleport if he is already right next to the surface he would be teleporting to.He can also jump.These two mechanics make up pretty much all of the gameplay in the game. You do eventually get a gun you can kill monsters and destroy certain blocks with partway through the game, which opens up a few more puzzles, but most of the game is centered around platforming with the teleportation gun – including one room towards the end of the game with no platforms in it at all, which the player scales by shooting shots across the room, landing, then jumping just as the shot hits the far wall.The game cost 50 cents on sale, and is extremely short – this is the sort of thing you can beat in a single sit down. I was pretty heavily achievement and secret hunting and beat the game in 89 minutes my first time through. All that’s left at that point is trying to figure out how to acquire the last few secrets, many of which are pretty devious (such as requiring you to go through about a third of the game without saving once so you can die and respawn at the very start with the block-destroying gun, in order to acquire one of the secrets).Was it worth 50 cents and an hour and a half of my time? I can’t say I wasn’t entertained by it, but it wasn’t high-quality entertainment – the game is decent enough as what it is, but it is not exactly aiming for the stars. If you like 2D platformers with simple, straightforward mechanics, this is probably a decent choice for you; if you like nice graphics, complex gameplay, a sophisticated story, or anything else like that, you’ll probably be disappointed by this game."

You have a teleport gun which teleports you to where the shot lands... a cool game mechanic that is very well implemented.Pros:-Figuring out how to get to the end of every screen is a lot of fun.-Timing and thought required make it enjoyable.-Short but not too short.-Tight controls.-Good soundtrack.-Good-looking pixel graphics.Cons:-Almost no story.

No story text popped up, no hints, nothing. ""Okay, maybe there's not supposed to be anything here."" I play around with the controls and learn them, since my escape button doesnt work. Controls learned, time to move on. I go to the right, since nothing is blocking my way, and nothing happens. Screen doesnt change to the next area or anything. ""This is really, really weird. Let me restart the game.""Alright, restarted the game and it puts me on the planet, just after Galaga. I get story text and hints this time, and my escape button works! Awesome. I move right, and then the screen changes. Fantastic! Game is going good...until I have to shoot my teleport gun. ""What the heck?"" I press X multiple times and no response. ""Dangit.

It's pretty amateurish and gave me a poor first impression.As the game progressed, I was pleased that it has some originality, and it's reasonably satisfying to jump around and teleport from place to place.  In the game's cleverer moments, it does a good job introducing new mechanics and ideas.It was over in less than an hour.  I was expecting the game to go on for quite a bit longer, considering it hadn't expanded upon the teleport-gun mechanic all that much, and I was still seeing the same three enemies.  I never spent a full five minutes in any one room, and I know that because several of the Steam achievements I didn't get reward being slow.  I'm sure there were some areas that I missed out on, but I don't care to go back to them, because it would mean going back through the unchallenging samey puzzles I already solved.I couldn't tell you what the plot of the game was, or how any of the music goes from memory, because none of it particularly stood out.  What I do remember is how irritating it was that the gun fired shots so slowly, and how enemies seemed to take more hits than necessary.  I remember discovering all the doors are needlessly one-way when I tried to check an earlier room and couldn't do it.  And I remember how closing a textbox had an awkward delayed reaction because I kept immediately reopening NPC dialog on accident.The way I see it, Out There Somewhere feels more like a prototype than a finished game.  There's very little diversity, no thought required, not enough polish, and even the visuals feel flat and artificial.  It's not bad, per se, but it's not great, and not something I'd recommend to my friends if they had to pay money for it."

But the game started to grow on me, the art style was pleasant, and the music is surprisngly well done. The mechanics of the game are simple, but fun and intuitive. The gameplay revolves around a gun which, when fired, fires a bolt which you teleport to when it collides with something. The puzzles designed around this are quite clever, and the game introduces more puzzle mechanics that spice up an already interesting style. It was getting interesting. And just as I felt as though the game was going to advance into something better, it ended. Now, I purchased this game for twenty cents, but it runs for five dollars normally. And because of this, I ultimately cannot recommend Out There Somewhere, as the game time is abyssmally short for the asking price, and honestly left me dissatisfied. I was able to beat the game in under an hour and a half. That sucks. The gameplay itself is enjoyable, but it feels more like a Flash game in the end."

As far as i can tell to 100% it you would also have to play a number of the levels in reverse as well to get all the collectable which i havent done. The main mechanic of this game is the teleportation system which is really cool, it allows for some really interesting puzzles that may require you to think about for a bit before you can complete them. In the same way Portal requires you to think with portals, this game requires you to think with perfectly timed teleportation.Would reccomend it at the normal price.

Things are kept nice and easy to begin with, but soon become more challenging as the game progresses.  Platforming is the genre type and the game benefits from responsive controls, good collision detection and audio feedback.Graphically - Nothing brilliant, but a competent throwback to the 8/16-bit days of the 90'sSound - Simple effects.  Nothing obnoxious - Once again, 8-bit styled around the PC engine eraDo I recommend?  I bought this for 19p on a sale and I have to tell you, it was a steal!  If you can get it for around £1 ($1.70) or less, you'll have a great little budget gem worthy of any retro-style platforming fan out there"

I would say that this game has its moments, but really, the game does nothing much to make itself have impact.It's a metroidvania game that lacks bosses, multiple powerups, or smart puzzles that offer diversity over difficulty. There's collectables, but they require backtracking, knowledge of the whole game world, and rarely give you hints on how to reach them. A new game+ mode would've been super helpful, where it lets you explore the game world past the final boss.If you're a sucker for gameplay that doesn't dip in quality, then sure, pick this game up for the dollar (or 25 cents) it's worth. You get it's full worth for what you pay. It's got cute character designs, neat gameplay designs, but there's not much more to the game than jumping around, some minor puzzles, and waiting for monster cycles. On the plus side, the game is short and straightforward to speedrun with the in-game timer mechanic.As far as minimally priced games go, this is one of the better ones, but you could always save up your money for a fantastic 10 dollar game over the short-lived, lackluster experience of this one."

It was what they were going for, but... I dunno, it just feels off, to me, because I've been playing more story-oriented games.-...feels like it was made for a Space-themed Game Jam.Overall, I can't say I'd reccomend it for those who want something with substance.

Expect to be confused and a little frustrated from the beginning. I think that a more helpful tutorial should of been in place, especially for newer players and people who aren't familiar with speedrunners.Most of the levels are really easy, but a few in between are just plain hard, from jumping and teleporting with miliseconds of error to jumping and dodging enemies while firing teleport shots across the map, it ramps up really fast. You also have to repeat a lot of content if you mess up, which is often due to the quick timing required.Easy game to play, difficult to master.The game is really short, only lasting around 2-3 hours. The game is only 1$.Anyway, this is my short review on this game, I didn't like it but I had to give it a try. I hope this review does not upset you, it is simply my opinion.Personal Rating: 1/5"

It is also not nearly as varied as Cave Story and other Metroidvania-style games; you will spend the majority of the game with just your teleport gun and a normal gun. And while the puzzles involving the aforementioned teleport gun are definitely interesting, the claimed inspiritations led me to believe I would have a bigger arsenal at my disposal.Another issue I have with the game is the use of bullet hell-like portions of the game. These sections feel very out of place in a game that is otherwise essentially a 2D version of Portal.Out There Somewhere is a decent game, considering the price, but the tauted inspirations to me implied a set of standards that the game did not deliver. Like I said above, this is 2D Portal. If that is what you want, then this game will do. But if you're looking for something Metroidvania-esque, look elsewhere."

The controls even work on both keypad and Steam controller, so you're not forced to unplug the Steam controller then immediately write an angry review.   Excellent.What makes this game cool is that it has both a shmup mode and a platformer mode.  What makes this game uncool is that these are both retro pixel versions of those modes.  But again, tolerance for at least accepting modern PCs exist.However, overall the controls are janky and annoying - if you don't jump at the exact correct pixel, you get punished.  Also, despite tremendous effort to make the game work stably on modern systems, it's still retro pixel rubbish.I think what has happened here is a bunch of talented and excellent developers who understood QA and testing and getting it to work before it's launched got hired by a bunch of baristas who convinced them that Starbucks was just their day job and they should write a game for them, and no hiring graphic artists so they don't have to do 2D pixel art is unneccessary, and thus a dead game in a flooded 2D retro pixel market was born.I don't know what to say here - the guys who did the QA and technical stuff?  Go get a job in the industry - you are worth a decent salary.  The idiots who thought a 2D pixel crapfest was worth dumping into a saturated market?  Here is my pointed down thumb, stop holding talented developers back!  To sum it up best - there is no point in being the tallest of all midgets."

When I beat the first boss (the only boss) the credits rolled and I thought the developers were making a joke. This is probably the shortest game I have ever played, and I was greatly disappointed by that. This game describes itself as taking the pages out of Super Metroid and Cave Story, both very long games with enormous worlds to explore, but this game is nothing like them at all. It's a shame, because what is in the game is awesome. Everything is built just right and it's something new I've never encountered before. But, this game is virtually a tech demo of what should have been a much more expansive game. If the developers made a sequel to this I'd buy it in a heartbeat, but this game by itself just isn't long enough to merit a purchase at its listed retail price."

Noticed the typo did you? Yeah there are a few in the game as well. I'm going to get to why I changed my review from a positive to a negative by the end of the game, but first we have to look at the positives:Pros:Silly fun and cool acheivementsOutstanding music, seriously it's never annoyingClever easter eggs and referencesFun ""2D Portal"" platforming, yes there are a lot of portal copycats, but this one is done wellSounds great, right? How could I not like this game after saying all these nice things about it? Well here we go:Cons:The plot is recycled barf, not that I expected much from this type of game, however this particular execution of ""You're the hero, he's the villian, go duke it out somewhere... IN SPACE"" was tired at best, which doesn't lend itself to the story like a Metroid game, or hell, even Portal's story was better. ""We're here to do research on portals, oh just kidding, I'm a sociopathic computer that has been trying to kill you this entire time!""This ultimately results in the one and only boss battle in the entire game. Did I mention this game was short? Yeah so with such a great game so far, guess what they went with for the boss battle, the one and only boss battle? How did JonTron put it again?Oh yes.Simon ♥♥♥♥ING says.Grigori goes from the left wall to the right every three times you hit him, and the only gun you have in the game you get in the second act (this game is not long enough to even have a third, mind you) and it's not a bazooka, it's a tiny little pea shooter that kills normal enemies in 4 hits, and Gregori needs half a bazillion to go down.Then Grigori decides it's time for round two in some spaceships that you've both miraculously had time to repair, and get this - during the game you were supposed to have picked up power ups you can only use in this one battle, but they are barely explained to you, and I don't think I picked up more than one. Oh what to do... Can't go back for them, so onwards you go for some more....SIMON ♥♥♥♥ING SAYS... BULLET HELL MODE.Yes, I ragequit that boss, yes, speedrunners have beaten this game in a clean 17 minutes...Maybe I'll go back and kill the dumb boss later...No, don't get it unless it's on sale, if for nothing else but the music, or just buy the soundtrack if it's available.Final verdict:3/10 - Cool (OK borrowed) concept and music with nice pixel visuals, but it all goes down the drain due to a tedious and unforgiving boss fight, and the lack of content or emotional investment/story development overall."

Since it was probably the worst part of it. Sketchy hitboxes and boring level design makes this really unecessary.Now for the actual game that involves you platforming to repair your ship. For it's pixel style the game did a pretty decent job with the visuals, except for the enemies which might as well have been coconuts. The music sounds cool at first, but gets boring the next 2 minutes after.The controls though, are really slick. Both the jumping and the teleporting feel really smooth and nice to play with.

,Not Recommended,263980,32049410,Posted: 29 May,all,ASeriesOfLetters,"+Fun, challenging platforming with tight controls+Teleport gun is a cool gimmick-Extremely short, with very little content and replayability-Lazy level design that misses the point of the Metroidvania style-Lazy presentation-Ham-fisted shmup sections at the beginning and end don't work-Awkward dialogueAbove all, this game feels lazy. It feels like the dev wanted to make a metroidvania but quit halfway through because it was too much work. It is so short. One hour and I finished my playthrough. No real replayability either; I could probably squeeze another playthrough out of it to try and get to more ""secrets"" and upgrades, but the game isn't fun enough to make me want to sit through it again just for that. The metroidvania-style screen-to-screen progression is wasted when your game is this linear and small; it just comes off as a level design cop-out. The upgrades are uninspired and the one that actually affects gameplay, the gun, is implemented really awkwardly. It pretends to be a metroidvania, but doesn't actually succeed at anything a metroidvania does, and we're left with a platformer with clunky levels that just feels unfinished. It's like a kid stomping around in dad's big shoes, but with none of the charm. Meanwhile, it has two shmup sections, one at the beginning and one at the end. They're bland and rather slow-paced with wonky hitboxes, and they don't really tell you when you've gotten hurt.The presentation of the game is mediocre across the board, neither offending nor dazzling. Mediocre ""retro-style"" pixel art and music only make the game seem even lazier. The levels look like they were made in a level editor for an actual complete game - outside of background setpieces, almost every single part of the environment is blocks with repeating textures. From a visual standpoint, this game is just bigger, uglier Terraria. The sound effects are unremarkable, and while the music isn't inherently bad, it's extremely loud even on the lowest setting and gets grating fast.I do have to give this game one thing: the platforming is fun. As a puzzle-platformer, this game shines. It's challenging, but not frustrating, and the wide variety of things you can do with the teleport gun really makes movement in the game feel free. The controls are tight and responsive (with the exception of firing your gun feeling a bit clunky at times), and I enjoyed the mix of puzzle solving and technical skill that the game encouraged. Unfortunately, this alone just can't support the weight of the game's flaws.Out There Somewhere is based on a good core concept with the teleport gun, but it doesn't go anywhere with it. If there was more content and the game encouraged exploration better, it could be a solid metroidvania. If it ditched the metroidvania level style and instead had actual levels more like your average puzzle platformer, it could be a solid platforming game. If this whole game was only the first world, and the game had more worlds like it with more and more challenges, upgrades, and progression broken up with shmup sections, the game could succeed as the weird mix that it is. But as it stands, Out There Somewhere is little more than a proof of concept.  As cheap as $2 is, there are better ways to spend your money. It's a decent experience if you get it on a good sale or in a humble bundle, though."

EVERYWHERE. And they're so open that it's hard not to fall in them during a puzzle.-Vertical Platforming that, if you fail one part, you will fall down a screen back to nearly the beginning every time.-Actually, all the puzzles make you restart them in one way or another when you fail one part.-Soundtrack doesn't really match up with the mood of some situations-NPCs are borderline useless to talk to, despite you being consistently encouraged to talk to them-WAY too many tutorials. Every time you see a new beam, the game wants you to know what it is. Every time a pixel on a graphic is shaded differently, the game has to bring up a slow-moving dialogue box to tell you. LET ME FIGURE IT OUT.-Puzzle mechanics are interesting, but they get bland very quickly, so to remedy that something new appears every screen or so in the beginning. This, however, will make the game even more bland in the end because there's way too much involved into the game that it's too complicated and ends up being uninteresting anyways.-Every once in a while I get lag spikes for some reason. I'm running on an Intel i7-4500U with 8GB RAM on Windows 10 (Home Edition) 64-bit. There is absolutely no reason this game should have any lag spikes. Also why does it claim it requires 512MB VRAM on the store page? Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst and Revolution require the same specs and is more graphically demanding in every way I can think of than this game. Also 1GB of RAM does seem like a lot to ask for with this sort of game Possibly unoptimized engine or code? I mean, I'm sure it can run on most machines decently, but if the developers here were working for a publisher for a larger-scale game, it would be unacceptable if they were to make the game require way more resources from the computer than it really should.Conclusion:Not really worth $1.99, you'd be better off paying around half of that for the game, or less."

The puzzles are never challenging and the teleportation mechanic is berely explored.  Most enemies can be ignored and killing them is a chore because the gun fires too slowly.  Instead of being engaging, each obstacle only serves to inconvenience you.  The colors are so same-y, all the envoronments blend together, and so dark it's sometimes unclear where enemies and platforms are.  The music is generic and the writing is boring and entirely unneccessary.  Things were only put in the game because games usually have them, not because they add anything to the experience.  All they add are a few seconds to the game's paltry length.Everything in this game has been done better in a thousand internet flash games.  Instead of spending money on this, go online and play one for free."

The pixel art is interesting through adding little effects here and there, like how the background is always moving, yet it's not distracting. It makes a cool visual. The game's setting has an oddly not-so-desolate, metroid-like, planet as a setting, which I'm also a big fan of. Another thing I enjoyed was that all the NPC's were nice little guys, and came some interesting lines, if you went the distance to talk to them. The soundtrack is also really nice, it fits the space theme without being boring. The puzzles (stages that have you use a portal gun to advance) were difficult, but never so hard that I gave up. That was a big one for me, and it probably had to do with how well you could see the puzzle in whole, and the simple mechanics. I really love the puzzles. The story is... not very exisistent. There is some bad guy, Grigori (ugly fellow), who is a total jerk, he blew up your ship, you wreck, so now you have to find him on this planet you wrecked on (I don't know why the bad guy is there, I think we were trying to go to the planet to attack him, buy it's not well explained). It does provide an objective, but it isn't very complicated. In whole, I bought the game for $0.16 (an awesome price), and was surprised. However, the game is really short. My 3 hours were all I needed to beat the game. But, if you're okay with short games, it's a lovely experience. I was only upset at the length to be honest. It feels incomplete,  like a greenlight game. I really want more cool puzzles and funny creatures, but then the games over. I also beleive that with more time it could have a neat little plot to help tie the story together. I just want more. An update with a story that goes somewhere (maybe to other planets) would solve all my issues with this game. There are collectables and an achievement for completing the game under an hour, which make the game more replayable in its defense, but it just won't fill the void."
,Recommended,263980,16820840,"Posted: 30 June, 2015",all,Double Uppercut,"Very begrudgingly, I recommend this game. Very begrudgingly! I did enjoy this game. It had fun mechanics, a nice look. Some good little humor thrown in here and there, but it didn't really have too much of a drive towards it. Near the end of the game I forgot I still had a nemesis to beat... and that his name was Grigorio. I was just concentrating on getting that orb... thing. And the main bulk of the gameplay is Portal-esque 2D puzzle platforming, and it's puzzling that doesn't just require know-how, it also requires good timing and patience. This game has a big difficulty curve, and you really need to think outside the box in order to beat it.My biggest complaint would have to be... the last boss. The game only has you do the 2D sideshooter for the first minute of the game, then expects you to hop back in knowing exactly what you're doing, right when you have to kill the final bloody boss. Thank you game, I have a brain, but not as fast of an adaptable one as you may think I do. With the main push towards patience, timing, and creative thinking- Out There Somewhere pushes it right out the door with the fast-paced, shoot-em-up with the final boss, and I did not like it. At all. But for what it's worth, the main bulk of the game and its gameplay is very nice. A fine throwback to old-school Nintendo games... but with a much nicer look."

Though this seems quite simple at first, it's used in many interesting ways. The game is pretty short, which isn't entirely a bad thing. It's about as long as it needs to be to make the most out of the central mechanic without things getting too stale. There's a few well-hidden secrets and some tricky achievements that add to the replay value, so you can get more mileage out of it that way. There's also some story points sprinkled throughout the game. They aren't much, but they help to add some flavour.My main complaint would be that there's no option to turn the dialogue off. Though it's not usually an issue, it gets pretty annoying getting the tutorial messages all over again when you need to restart the game after messing up the Daredevil achievement for the 50th time. I'm also not a fan of how the level design often prevents backtracking. It's clearly a deliberate design decision that aids in the cleverness of some of the secrets, but I still found it kind of irksome.Ultimately, I would recommend this game. It's a little thin on content for the price, though, so I'd wait for a sale if cost is an issue. I managed to get it for under a dollar, so I was satisfied."

Overall, this game is good and quite fun.Side note: There are two 2D space shooting segments, one at the beginning of the game and one as a second (last) phase of the final boss fight. Keep in mind that this game *is* a 2D platforming game, so don't get confused, angry, discouraged or something else like that when you find yourself in space. It's okay."

If you're like me, and couldn't care less about the achievements, you may find yourself thankful that you got the game on sale and only paid $0.19 for it. I recommend the game - not the price. $5 is a little steep for a game that's over so quickly. What's there is worth playing, but it's not worth the asking price. Even with as challenging as some of the puzzles are, requiring multiple attempts, I managed to beat the game in 90 minutes - and I'm pretty terrible at platformers.Get it on sale, and you won't be disappointed.

The controls are tight, and unlike Cave Story's Quote, Captain Yuri doesn't feel very floaty when he jumps or falls. A lot of the platforming puzzles in this game involve well-timed drops that Super Smash Bros. Brawl-styled gravity would make far too easy to perform, so this is a very good thing.Out There Somewhere is great. Get yourself a copy!"

It took me about 2 hours to beat the game, but there is a marginal amount of replayability if you push for acquiring all of the Steam achievements.The game is 2D Metroid (NES) style and is very linear, with a few optional detours for special items if you feel up to it.  Each side-scrolling screen you pass into plays out as increasingly difficult Portal-type, platforming puzzles.  Near the 2/3 mark of the game, there were perhaps 2 screens that were difficult enough that I had to cave in and check a walkthrough for and when I found the answer, it was a slap-upside-the-head DERP answer I felt like I should have obviously known, but some spots do require some brain-power, which were refreshing.*DISCLAIMER: Everyone and their dead dog needs to buy this game while it is only 19 cents to purchase!

You may see this and think ""ugh this style of game has been played literally to death"" and you'd be right, but this deserves its due diligence for being a really clever little game.I feel it's very much like an alternate-universe take on VVVVVV's gameplay mechanics; instead of a gravity flip you have a simple teleportation gun, kind of like an ultra-simplified Portal; you shoot a beam that sends you in a straight line to wherever it hits, which in theory sounds pretty lame, but the level design makes for some very tricky and mind-bending puzzle situations.You'd be a fool to pass this up for 19 cents.

,Recommended,263980,17842578,"Posted: 1 September, 2015",all,brandan,"Bought Out There Somewhere on sale for $0.19, it regularly sells for $4.99. It's worth the regular price, because I'd probably spend that much in quarters to beat it. I have 1.7 hours on record, and that was one playthrough to finish the game. The teleportation mechanic works well with the level designs. A few of the puzzles can be skipped easily with well placed portal shots, but they don't require enough effort to feel like more than small victories over what seems to be the planned route. A decent amount of that 1.7 hours was spent experimenting with routes through different areas, and found that the developers were a little bit amusingly playful, though I don't want to spoil the experiences for anybody who may be pleasantly annoyed by them.The game isn't really about fighting. It feels as though some schmup tutorial project was thrown into the project to add meat to the game, but its difficulty amounts to how quickly you can mash the fire button, especially with the large amount of life you're given during the schmup portions of the game. The Gauss gun is used in some decently challenging puzzles, but not really necessary for any combat.The music is reminiscent of Cave Story. I caught my head bobbing a few times, and had to look around to be sure nobody was up to catch my inadvertant dysrhythmic neck spasms.I described the movement on my twitch stream as being something between Super Mario Bros. 3 and Mega Man, with better air control than Mega Man, but maybe some more friction than SMB3. The controls feel tight and responsive, even though it requires about 1/4 to 1/2 of the game for me to develop a habit for good teleporter jumping.I finished this game wanting more. Definitely check this out if you enjoyed Cave Story, or any platformer that requires tight and precise movements using combinations of buttons."
76561198038149962,Recommended,263980,17539135,"Posted: 14 August, 2015",all,Аxleaye,"This game can be pretty enjoyable for a few hours, and it's somewhat memorable. I'll go over its notable aspects here.StoryThe story is pretty much as basic as it can get, cliché even. However, I was satisfied with how they handled it in implementation. Whoever designed the story segments was well aware that nobody would care. Instead of shoving some bland exposition down your throat while you slump lifelessly over your keyboard and wonder if playing through this game is a commitment you're willing to make, it provides the story in short, quickly skippable (or quickly readable) lines of text. You can get through it in a few seconds, and you're not missing much if you ignore it entirely. The gist is that you're a spaceman on a foreign planet and need to kill some guy. Narrative gold.GraphicsThe pixel art isn't bad. It's not anything special. It's not too repetitive. Sprites gel pretty well with each other, but tile sprites stick strictly to their square shape and corners aren't adorned in any way to reduce the jaggedness of such defined tiles. All of the main character's animations are so beautifully fluid, though, and the walking animation is adorable.AudioThe music is pretty average. Sometimes it gets better, but it gets redundant and loses its charm as it loops. In the game's store page description, it throws around names such as Cave Story. If they're going to tote around a reference to a game like that, I think it's only fair to interpret that as a standard to hold their game to. It falls abysmically below this standard.ControlsControls feel fine and function as intended. Some precision is required, but it's not unforgiving.MechanicsThis is the good bit. The game is based on traversing through puzzles using a simple mechanic: You can fire projectiles horizontally. When these projectiles impact something, you are teleported to the point of impact. Combine this with precision platforming and quick thinking, and you can pull off some neat stunts. New objects are introduced that add more depth to the puzzles. For example, there are colored beams that can destroy, obstruct, or even redirect your shots. These can be toggled by switches or obstructed by objects. I think the store page description's comparison of this game to Portal is actually pretty fair. While the mechanics and dimensionality are different, they require the same kind of problem solving and reflex. The teleportation gun is ineffective as a weapon, however, which brings us to...CombatAt first, you have to avoid enemies entirely because you lack a means of removing them. At some point, your character aquires a new tool: a firearm. Now, the first thing you'd want to do is go out and start packing heat at anything that looks like it could accommodate a few bullets, but you'd soon find out that your shiny new baby isn't very empowering. There are only a few types of enemies. Some exist to serve as barriers in the puzzles, and your weapon is only a tool for removing them. The rest exist just so that there are enemies. They're usually not challenging or unique, but I suppose they do add some variance. You can collect hidden items to increase the number of hits you can take, but health isn't really something that needs to be managed. Other than the boss battle, the combat isn't explored past this.I'd like to point out that the store page description also points to Super Metroid, and again interpret such a reference as justification to compare these games both ways. Again, it's not even a close comparison.At the end, you have to utilize both your teleport gun and firearm to battle the main antagonist by moving around the room to dodge attacks and position yourself to have a clear shot. This part is actually quite well done, but I was not at all prepared for what came next. That's covered in...Level Design and ProgressionPuzzles can be pretty creative. They're typically not too difficult, and checkpoints are generous enough to ensure that you're not getting frustrated about replaying the same sections. Puzzles frequently introduce new ways to utilize the tools that you already have, rarely feeling repetitive. If you're observant and think a little more to get to alternate paths, you can get rewarded with items, even if they're not always useful. The puzzles are overall satisfying and engaging.The largest and ugliest flaw of this game is its length. When I reached the end, I was unsure if I was just misinterpreting what was going on. It was just so absurdly short. It was a decent ride, though.Now, I'd like to explain how it pulls off this ending. In the last section, I mentioned a boss battle in which you use what you've gained to take out the main antagonist. After he's defeated, you get out of there, walk a screen or two, and then it slams into you so unnervingly hard. Suddenly, the quite enjoyable puzzle platformer I was playing now has me careening through space in my ship, toe to toe with another.I am now suddenly playing a side-scrolling shoot 'em up sequence. There is no similar puzzle mechanic or anything. There's just dodging and mashing to spam bullets. I personally do not enjoy shmups. I barely play them, and when I do, they do not entertain me. I didn't know that I was in for this when I played through a puzzle-oriented ""action platformer,"" as the store page describes it.Anyway, maybe I just suck at these things, but I didn't have the motivation to power through that final boss battle. I got someone else to help me out with the mashing part, just for the sake of completion.RatingI've decided to rate this game positively for two reasons: I picked it up on sale for a nice price, and the majority of the game's mechanics and level design were pleasant and impressive.TL;DRI originally intended for this to be brief, but yet again, I rambled far too long. Basically, the only good selling point is the great puzzle-based gameplay. The game is incredibly short (a few hours at best), so it's best to pick it up on sale. I wouldn't advise paying for it at full price unless you're an afficionado for this stuff."

The pixel art graphics are nice to look at and you can always recognize all elements of the environment which is in my opinion a must for this genre (nothing worse than having obfuscated obstacles/deathtraps). The controls were precise enough on my XBox 360 controller.I missed probably most secrets on my playthrough, and while I enjoyed getting through the game, I'm not sure if I would want to go back and search for them.In each screen it was clear where I had to go, and then was left to figure out how to get there. The puzzles were probably not the hardest you will see in platformers, but they didn't frustrate me, either, except at one stage when I had a dense moment and couldn't figure out a certain technique that the game requires you to learn.If I had a major complaint it would likely be the length of the game, but at the price of 4.99 I'm not going to complain. :)Pro:- fun jumping/teleportation puzzles without being too frustrating- generous checkpoints- nice clear graphics (as all puzzle platformers should have)- nice chiptune soundtrackCon:- a bit short, but ok for a 4.99 game- could use a level editor/Workshop integration to have user created challenges"

There are many different elements that flesh out gameplay like timed blocks, metal grates, beams that stop the round, beams that bend the round, beams that reflect the round, etc.   Your objective is nothing more than to reach the other side of the room so that you can journey on and collect space components to repair your spaceship.The graphics are pretty simple but are charming in their own right.

,Recommended,263980,16498602,"Posted: 18 June, 2015",all,Kafro Hudrep,"Out There Somewhere is an action-platformer where the primary gimmick is a gun that teleports you to where you shoot it. It's quite short — my first playthrough clocked in at just over an hour — but even so there's a surprising amount of depth in the game's platforming challenges, as well as a few secrets here and there to discover. I legitimately tried looking for as many as I could in that first playthrough, only to discover at the end that I had missed around half of them. Additionally, for the speedrun inclined, there is an option to display a timer, and it is entirely possible to finish the game in about 11 minutes.The game doesn't feature a complicated plot — it's the simple tale of a space cop who has to shoot up an evil alien dude. If you're a huge nostalgic memelord you might enjoy the blatant Zero Wing references. Graphically, the game resembles Cave Story with extra frames of fluidity added to the sprite animations. It's nice to look at in general, and the alien friends are charming. The chiptune music is also pretty good, save for one annoying track near the beginning of the game that seemed to only last like 20 seconds before looping.There are several minor issues I suppose I should mention. For one, there are many screens that cannot be returned to once they're left, and frequent checkpoints, while normally a boon, mean that if you've missed a collectible, you've probably also lost the opportunity to get it. Considering that health upgrades are part of these collectibles and you only have one health to begin with, it is entirely possible to end up past a point of no return where you have to finish the game as a one-hit-wonder, or just restart because it's too annoying to handle.Along with that, there's also an achievement that requires having 30 teleport gun shots on screen at once; the only apparent way to do that causes a cacophony of ear-piercing sound effects unless the game is muted. I can't imagine this being an oversight, and since I'm a jerk I found it sort of amusing, but still ow.Nitpicking aside, Out There Somewhere is a solid title for anyone in want of bite-sized platforming fun. It is also literally $0.19 during the Steam Summer Sale, and the 3 Steam Trading Cards it drops should recoup the bulk of that price. This game is a must buy before the sale ends.p.s. i just noticed that the developer's logo mascot changes colors on every start up and that is an odd feature i don't know if anyone but me would notice but i like it thank you"

The teleport mechanics are nifty and make for some mind bending puzzles. The combination of side scrolling shooter and platforming is nice, but again the both sections are short and only a few enemies.

Reminiscent of Portal, esp. in that you keep your momentum.-Really cute an colorful pixel art, esp. the character portraits. Reminiscent of Cave Story.-Fun platforming in general-Some secrets add some more game time, like in Metroid.-Really reasonable price (21c on summer sale)-Difficulty is just right... could of gone further and more challenging though.Cons :-Space shooter is very primitive and short. A short portion at the beginning and after the final boss.-Game is pretty short (I beat it in literally an hour)-Some music, while cute, has very short loops that get annoying when you die a lot.-Combat is non-existant at first, and even after a gun is acquired enemies can easily be avoided in most cases.-Only one boss fight, which is rather simple-Unsatisfying ending-Practically non-existant story. There is some dialogue and pixel-art cutscenes, but that's it.

They're all sentered around this portal gun that beams you to wherever the bullets hit. From there, new elements are added to modify gameplay slightly, but overall, the basics are the same. As far as difficulty, this game is a medium, although there will be certain rooms that are so strangely difficult and out of nowhere that you'll be tearing you hair out either trying to find the solution or trying to figure out how to put that solution into action, but most of the time it's a pretty smooth, slightly difficult challange.Overall, I deffinetly recommend this game to anyone who likes platformers.8/10."

I'd recommend this game with some qualifiers. It's short, at about an hour and a half, and maybe 2 hours if you search for every ship upgrade. The sprite art isn't particularly inspired and the environments are bland, but the games aesthetic isn't in any way bad. The music is along the same lines, passable, with really only one tune being moderately memorable. The teleportation mechanic here is used ocassionally well but never to any mindbending extent, though there is some promise in the nuances, and would be great to expand upon to make it more twitch based or have more intricare puzzles. It's definitely not a portal rip-off, and has plenty of its own imaginitive power, so hopefully that can be fleshed out if there's ever a sequel. Overall it was definitely worth 2 bucks."

Because Im a cheapskate, I like games to pay only for games that are replayable but I got it at a major sale of 96% off, (19 cents). Because the game is only 1.5 to 2 hours long, I would not reccomend it for full price of 5.00$. As a game itself though, it was great! Its a mixture of the old style look of games like metroid and a little of a Portal like idea.  A great strategy game, kept me on the edge of my seat. Not extremely frustrating, but at times not easy at all. I Loved It! I would only reccomend it though at a most pricepoint of 3.00$ in my opinion, but if your bored and you got an extra five bucks, dive in! I love how it switches from strategy to (for a very short time) a galactica type of game. I actually wish they would expand it so that say you would need to go onto different planets, gather parts and then launch back up where you would again engage mid space.

I actually feel somewhat bad for paying less thana  dollar for this game; However, at 40 minutes for my exploratory playthrough and an alomst easier 16 minute speedrun, the shortness of the game is a slight drawback. I would GLADLY pay for a sequel to this.

Absolutely.This is a great game, the soundtrack is pretty good, the graphics look classic and neat, it's game mechanics are easy to understand and fun to use and Playing with an Xbox 360 controller makes it control amazingly.However, there're two main gripes I have with this game.First of all, the length, I played this completely blind, and I was able to complete it in about 2 hours, the story, and the game, feel pretty short.And second, the difficulty, It never gets or brutally hard or stupidly simple, but it's relatively easy, some of the ""Harder"" screens in the game are pretty trivial, removing some of the challenge.So overall, should you purchase this game?Yes...

Beside walking and jumping, you have a teleport gun - it fires a blue projectile horizontally, and where it hits, there you'll be teleported. Teleportation maintains the momentum you have at the moment when the projectile hits - that opens up a boarload of navigation puzzle opportunities, which are thoroughly explored by the game designers.The game has a cute 8-bit-ish soundtrack that you'll either love or hate - I happen to love it.Out There Somewhere is an ideal casual game - short (1-2 hours), not too difficult but not trivial, and thoroughly enjoyable.

Your teleshot preserves movement, so if you fire and then jump at the last second, you will jump at that other place you just teleported to. This can be used to jump, fire, then as soon as you hit the ground jump again to do basically a double jump. Theres also a bunch more mechanics as well, such as 3 diffrent beams, enemies, glass and wood, mirrors, and a bunch of other stuff. Also the achievments are pretty challanging (all but one) to get and can add hours of gameplay if you're into that.Overall, great mechanic, great soundtrack, love the metriod style, and challanging achievments.9/10.Edit: theres a HUGE difficulty spike at the final boss, one misclick and you're screwed. Thought i'd mention that."

I expected absolute garbage from the game, yet found myself pleasantly surprised. There's actually a pretty good little game in here, worthy of attention even if it's not on sale oddly enough.The basic concept is you start out in a rather limited 2D space shooter. You get shot down, fall to the planet, and then have to collect parts to repair your ship and escape. The writing's mediocre at best, and the plot's hardly anything to write home about, but the gameplay really does shine surprisingly well.You have three buttons, other than left/right. These are jump, fire a gun when you find it eventually, and fire a teleporter gun. This sounds simple. It's not. They actually put pretty good effort into coming up with some creative puzzles that take a bit of thought to overcome with these few tools.Momentum's carried over, so if you fire a teleport shot, and it has enough time to travel, you can jump upward as it hits and keep going up from where you portal to. This is put to surprisingly good use with some really rather clever yet deceptively simple looking puzzles.Toss in a bit of exploration and some hidden goodies, advanced stuff and bonuses scattered around, and it's actually not a bad game at all.Yeah, the story sucks. Yeah, the dialgue is awful. Yeah, it's only about an hour long from start to finish. But you know what? It's CHEAP. And to be blunt, the gameplay itself is good enough to ignore all that and just sit down to a fun little puzzle game that vaguely has some ever so slight similarities to metroid.I can actually recommend this game at full price. It's actually worth it. Just don't expect it to have good writing is all. =P"

When I got into the game my view for Out There Somewhere changed drastically. I found myself loving this game. Out There Somewhere mixes a bullet hell arcade shooter with a platformer. All of this is done with well crafted sprites and backgrounds and is accompanied by a stellar 8 bit soundtrack that never seems to get repetitive.Out There Somewhere excells with its platforming and space combat. However the platforming combat was quite dull and the characters movements were a bit sharp at times. Beyond that the teleportation gun added a fun addition to the 2D platforming style and allowed there to be puzzles in the game.The game is about an hour long but has replay value for those who want to complete everything. When I got stuck on certain areas I wasn't stuck for long as the puzzles are relatively easy. Overall I enjoyed this game and I recommend this game to all platforming fans, 8bit fans and indie fans. Out There Somewhere is a fun twist on the classic 8bit metroidvania platformer.Score: 7/10While having good graphics and a great soundtrack the platforming was a bit stiff and this game does not stand out from others of the same genre, but still a fun game nonetheless."

You'll die, sure, but it's because you suck, rather than the game wanting to make you feel like you suck.What makes this is inspired is how well its gimmick, the teleporter gun, is implemented - you fire it, a bullet goes off traveling, and when that bullet hits something, you'll be instantly transported to that point - continuing your current momentum. That's what's key.You get eased into these simple 'jump up & shoot towards this platform you can't jump across to' puzzles & then suddenly you're jumping up, firing it off across to a wall, landing & jumping again in a different direction just as it hits, then repeating all that immediately in a different direction, but with none of the stress of a lot of these dumb modern-retro platformers.It rocks."

,Recommended,263980,21586695,"Posted: 2 March, 2016",all,HA HA HA. Oh Wow.,"Let me open by saying this game is cheap, but is it worth the price tag?Yup.I recently played(and reviewed) a similar puzzle platformer, VVVVV or some nonsense, which I didn't find was to my liking.  As such I had some apprehension about Out There Somewhere.I'll tell you that was some misplaced anxiety.  This game has a teleport mechnic that allows it to progress beyond simple muscle reflex puzzles and actually assess all the factors on a screen before proceeding with a solution.  After I completed the game, I felt satisfied.  I felt like I had accomplished some pretty interesting puzzle platforming, and I felt like I kind of wanted to play it through again.All that being said, this game isn't very long.  I don't know how much time I spent playing it, currently, but I think it was about an hour(Edit: 54 mins...)  which was actually perfect since I was on a flight and after I finished we were close to landing.  I see myself playing this again on my return trip and probably enjoying it just as much.One interesting thing I noticed in the options was the feature to turn on a timer, which seems an interesting little contraption to let you time your runs.  There's also a few areas I can think of where I may have been able to explore but they were early in the game before I really learned the capabilities of the teleporter gun.That's another bit that's interesting.  They don't throw new items at you through the game to make places accessible, with the exception of a gun near the beginning.  Anything you are able to accomplish late game with the teleporter you can do at the start... provided you grasp the concept fast enough.  The gun you obtain later is really only to destroy blocks and enemies, but it seemed to me (nearly) every screen could potentially be accomplished without killing a single enemy.The last bit I'll mention is that I played this game entirely on the Steam Controller, I've yet to find a platformer that doesn't work well with it, but I'll say playing a game on the plane was MUCH more comfortable with a controller in hand, rather than playing the part of a contortionist to access the keyboard wedged in front of me, though this is just commentary and doesn't affect my review of the game.Addition: OK, so since I was in an airplane and didn't pay for wifi, steam didn't register the time I'd played the game and wouldn't let me post a review with 0 minutes logged.  I started up a new game and can confirm in the 12 minutes of extra play time I found 3 screens I didn't even register existed on my first play through within the 'tutorial' section of the game.  So if you happen to be an achievement collector, or just like the game you can easily double that hour play time going through with a replay.Its worth the standard price(which is cheap as it is,) but if you find this game on sale, don't hesitate to nab it if you enjoy puzzle games or plaformers.  It's got some interesting mechanics."

The concept of a teleport gun gave the level design alot of potential, and the developers definitely took advantage of most of this potential. Although some puzzles in the game could be completely by passed by either time a jump just right or soaring across a good chunck of the map by leaping off of a giant beacon tower thing, most of them were really engaging. Some of them really made me stop and think and plan things out. And most of the levels not only required you to think about the puzzle, but also made you react while performing this level. This concept isnt new, but it is in the game and really complements the gameplay. Being such a short game as well, the ending boss battle comes very quickly. The entire game took me 50 minutes for me to complete on my first attempt, but the boss battle was insane. A good kind of insane. And although very difficult in my opinion, it was definitely one of the most enjoyable boss battles I have encountered.I got the game on sale for 19 cents, but the game is definitley worth its full $5.

It had good reviews on Steam, cost less than a dollar (was on sale for 49 cents) and was reported to be a short game. I didn’t have much to lose. Either I lose a few hours of my time or have a brief but enjoyable experience, fortunately it was the latter.Out There Somewhere is advertised as “inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid and Portal”. Great! I love all three of those games and I would consider Super Metroid to be my top games of all time. The bad news is that the game doesn’t really fit two of the games. It doesn’t have the multiple guns, boss battles and exploration elements in Cave Story and Super Metroid. The only game that is an apt description is Portal. Buyer be warned!The primary mechanic of the game is the teleport gun similar to the portal gun in Portal. The only difference is that instead of summoning two portals, the teleport gun instantly teleports our hero when the projectile makes contact with a wall. The teleport gun makes way for some very interesting puzzles. One common scenario is where you would need to shoot at a wall and quickly jump to maintain momentum after you teleport.Aside from the teleport gun, there is a blaster gun that you can use. Not much to say about it other than it takes a few shots to kill anything and doesn’t feel like it has a lot of impact to it.There’s nothing to the story. In fact, I can sum it up in one sentence. Generic space hero gets his ship shot down, lands on a planet, explores the planet to find parts to repair his ship and once his ship is repaired he kills the bad guy.I finished Out There Somewhere in an hour. I could have spent more time exploring and searching for hidden secrets but the game never compelled me to. After finding the parts necessary to get the ship up and running, I wanted to explore the world more. Oddly when I walked to the next screen I was abruptly placed back into the ship and fighting a boss.Overall I had fun with Out There Somewhere. The game is appropriately paced and the puzzles had a nice even ramp in difficulty. The lack of content is concerning, but given the price there isn’t much to complain about. Out There Somewhere shines well especially when compared to other games of the same price."

Think VVVVVV except instead of swapping gravity you jump, shoot, & teleport, and you'll have a good idea.Oh, and also there are space shooter sequences right at the beginning & end.If you want a cheap, short, challenging game to kill a weekend afternoon, this is a good buy.

I started the game up and played through the first few screens until I got stuck at the first puzzle because I'm an idiot and I closed the game. I didn't touch it for a week and a half.Soon I was sitting in my chair hovering my mouse cursor over the 'Refund' button before deciding to launch the game a final time. If I couldn't figure out how to get past the puzzle in 10 minutes, I would get a refund and buy a trading card or something with the $0.49 I spent on the game. I ended up figuring out how to get through the level and I kept playing until the very end of the game. I then regretted not buying the game at full-price after I finished it, when just an hour ago I was about to refund it.It's not a very long game, but I think that's intentional. It's a game that deserves to be disected and studied. I've beaten the game six times in five hours, with one of my playthroughs being as short as 17 minutes and 42 seconds. I still keep going back and beating it again and again.This little indie game has me bewildered. It's addictively fun and perfectly difficult. It's the type of difficulty that doesn't take it easy on you but doesn't discourage you from retrying and you end up hooked. It's just short enough to not get boring too quick and just long enough to stay fresh throughout multiple playthroughs. The puzzles are ridiculously fun to solve while the 8bit score is blasting through your speakers. The game is packed full of secret areas and hidden collectibles that are easy to find if you know the game's tricks. Every single screen you come across has some sort of hidden entrance to a secret zone. The mechanics are inventive, fresh, and tight. The slow-moving projectiles of the portal gun give you time to think where you're going next and pull of some pretty incredible mid-air stunts if you're good enough. The control layout is of a standard arcade cabinent (I played with a controller however). Simplisity is key with this game, and that's not a bad thing.8.4/10 - tl;dr : The game will surprise you. It's packed with secrets and has a great soundtrack. The gameplay is addictively fun and inventive, with that Mario Brothers / Dark Souls type of difficulty that keeps you hooked. Short, but fun to replay over and over again if you're an achievement hunter.NOTE: I got a free Steam Key for another game called ""Polarity"" when I opened the game the first time. That right there in itself is worth 49 cents in my humble opinion. That, and the free soundtrack folder that comes with the games files."

About 1.5 hours on first playthrough and thus the only thought going through my head was that it was equivalent to a really well made flash game online. Now that we're past that...Pros:Great opening, captured the retro feel in both the cutscene and sidescroll space shooter part, especially the forced death trope was done nicely. Gameplay is smooth, fun, and rewarding. It definitely takes inspiration from VVVVV though, but no problem there. Sound is amazing, the soundtrack is great for a 20 cent game. Also a nice bit of collectibles that are well hidden, so it is good for speedruns too.Cons:A bit short so once again buy it on the cheap. The idea of the teleport gun is somewhat cliche and some parts (such as the first part of the final boss fight) felt like a lame flash game made by some 12 year old, in which the boss has only 2 moves and both are really easy to avoid.Overall this game is mostly fun aside from a few ""eh"" moments, so buy it on sale."

They're contrived, really have no point, and if the game ended with the final battle that tested your skills, then that would be amazing, not the 'This is my final form' bs.And second off, the story will rub you the wrong way.  It will.  I recommend skipping all the dialogue, because its a McGuffin plot that thinks it's more than that.

Using this gun you fire a shot that when it hits a wall, will teleport you there, as is its name. Sounds simple, yes? But not so, no. The things that you can do with it are many, which you will find as you figure it out to get past levels. Never did it feel like the game was impossible, though frustrating certainly (lot of it self inflicted). The experience was quite good.Pros: Unique mechanic, good art style, acceptable level of difficulty.Cons: Lack of any real story beyond good guy chasing bad guy (see those guys on the cover art? you'll only ever see each one once except the main character and throwaway alien NPC's), my own gripe on the short delay on firing your teleport gun after using the gauss gun (your basic pew pew, nothing fancy), and that you're given a health bar of sorts despite it being redundant as you'll always die in one hit (exclusion being the bullet hell shooters, but those are literally a game apart from each other)Verdict, play it.

Just finished another playthrough of it, and I have to say that this game had me on a leash for my entire playtime. It could practically toy with my emotions at will, and has. And ninety percent of that comes from the writing, which is humorous, but still touching.While I can't give too much away (you might be tired of hearing that, sorry), I can say the characters are memorable and well-rounded, the world building is fantastic, and the twists always had me. That's probably the number one thing that will stand out about this game; the major twists (which you certainly won't find within one playthrough).There are flaws, and I should be outright about them. While the character design is, as I said, memorable, and the color scheme really pops, the pixel art itself is not the best. It's not always easy to interpret what you are looking at. And while the writing is still great, sometimes it gets into weirder territory, which annoyed me a little. It also does go a little too far with what it's trying to do sometimes.The gameplay also has a unique twist on the RPG formula as well. Rather than leaving things to chance, Undertale judges your hits on a simple quick time event, and allows you to simply avoid enemy attacks. On top of that, you also have the option to spare an enemy, if you can figure out how to calm them down. This means that every enemy encounter is a moral choice, and while that's usually a bad thing, here it completely works, due to, again, the writing. I found myself not wanting to kill these monsters after a short while, even though it raises your LV thus giving you more health. Still, sparing monsters becomes more and more difficult as time goes on, as does avoiding taking damage. It does get tiring sometimes, but the formula is shaken up from time to time.Overall, it had me absorbed from beginning to end, and I highly recommend it for the story alone, on top of the gameplay that manages to mesh with the plot so well."

Every new puzzle has a slight tweak on it's predecessor, teach-test-test in a very fluid layout.I'm still sort of in shock by how short it is, but I'm feeling very fond of it regardless.Only complaints are that he sort of pulls the rug out on you... there's a collectable you keep finding in the game.

If you aren't the type of player to just look up how to win and how to get the achievements, it is a pretty difficult game! My first playthrough I beat the game in an hour and a half (yeah its a short game), my most recent playthrough took me 16 minutes. Honestly, this game was worth it."

,Recommended,263980,33382883,Posted: 8 July,all,OctoberFox,"Teleport Fun!This was an unexpected surprise. I went in expecting a cheap little platforming game and what I got was an adventure game that was short and very sweet.The story is quite basic, but you start out in a scrolling shooting game and wind up stranded after the battle on a planet. From there you explore with the use of a teleport gun, all to find your nemesis and escape.The teleoprt gun is pretty slick, and I honestly can't think of a lot of games off the top of my head that emulated this type of 'metroidvania' style game play using such an item. I'm sure they'reout there somewhere,but I haven’t seen them. That said, it is a slick mechanic executed flawlessly in this game. The gun fires a beam that reacts differently depending on whether or not it hits a solid surface, crosses beams of different colors, or passes through bars. There's not a lot to explain here, it all becomes very evident as you play.Mastering the use of the teleport gun and jumping becomes essential, and then second nature. The game trains the player through elegant and simple level design that will show newcomers a way through and experienced players a lot of previously missed shortcuts.The games graphics are really excellent.I myself experienced a bug that made it all look like a bad Atari Game, but there is a feature withATI/AMDvideo cards called'Mipmap level detail'. The forum had some insight, but in my case, rather than going into Catalyst Control Center I had to right-click the tray icon and go through a few menu trees to find the option.Setting it from 'High performance' to 'Performance'did the trick.Once I had the visuals working right I could make out all the little details that had before been a terrible blur.Graphically this is like a really well made Sega Master System game. I really enjoyed the style and felt just a little nostalgic for the old 8-bit era games. The game play falls into this category as well, being both clever and classic.Sound effects and music are also well done, and in the same vein of those 8-bit era games.The game is very short and can be completed in under 20 minutes (my record is 16 minutes), but has a good amount of replay value if you want to explore, discover a handful of hidden areas, and maybe see how fast you can complete the game itself. The game makes no mistakes, the player does. When I kept getting killed it was my fault for not paying attention to what was going on, or for goofing off. The game doesn't punish the player, but it totally rewards good skill and timing.I only used my controller to play this and found absolutely no problems.I've clocked over 8 hours and enjoyed every hour spent here. I would love to see more, even a sequel, but as it stands this is a solid platforming game worthy of your time.Pros:Nice graphic styleGood soundChallenging but not frustratingTight controlsCons:ShortVisual bugs for someVerdict: 8/10Short but brilliant experience. Recommended, especially if on sale."

However, do not let this stop you from gettting this game, because at its core,Out There Somewhere is a very solid puzzle platformer.The main drawing point of this game is the use of the Teleport Gun, which, as its name implies, teleports you wherever its bullet hits. There are many unique and clever puzzles throughout the game that utilize this gimmick to its fullest. On the other hand, combat is extremely basic and nothing to write home about. The game looks and sounds great thanks to its retro art style and soundtrack. Steam achievements do provide some replayability, which can be gotten within 4/5 playthroughs, and guides are available if you would like to obtain them faster. While there are many elements of Out There Somewhere that are mediocre at best, its puzzle platforming alone is worth it.TLDR - Very fun puzzle platformer utilizing teleportation, but extremely short and very little replayability"
,Recommended,263980,33391162,Posted: 8 July,all,Element,"This indie 2D platformer game is pretty awesome to play but with such a short campaign, no online, no other missions to play, and no workshop whatsoever, it's hard to justify paying even 2 dollars for it.The mechanics are extremely simple but the gameplay is challenging and actually surprisingly innovative. The use of the teleport gun throughout the game is genius, and the puzzes never get too hard, and the game has no loading screens or breaks. The story never really amazed me, but it's solid and the game does leave off for a sequel.Like I said at the beginning though, it's quick. I beat the game in less than two hours. If 2 dollars seems worth it to you, pick it up. But if you want to wait until it goes on sale (which most of the time, it is for 49 cents), then I definitley recommend you pick it up."

The game centers around using teleportation and momentum in order to navigate puzzles and progress through the game. It's very entertaining and rewarding when you finally figure out a puzzle. Each stage is gradually more challenging, but never gets to the point where it feels impossible to progress. The gameplay never feels stale either as it continues to add new enemies, blocks, beams, etc in order to add new dimensions to how you can navigate each stage. The only issue I can find (if you can call it that) is that it is very short (about 2 hours), but that's a decent length for the price."
