When you enter the world of Nor you are assailed with nostalgic feelings of Magic Carpet, Gothic 2, Myst, Alladin and other Shaherezad tales. The game gave me that googly eyed feeling of listening to a campfire story from the village elder.Onwards to features... You get to throw rocks, no wait. You get to bury a lizard in a pit of sand, charge up a rock with awesome wind power and ram it in its snout at supersonic speeds. Or toss some lava rocks at em and watch em burn. You make the rules. Aaaaaand once you pile all the corpses in a neat pile in the corner you can grab a cup of tea and wrack your brain on the intricately designed puzzle that lets you get to the next room.Obviously this game needs polish and work, but the framework is solid. Devs seems to be dedicated to making a good game. And once they get the cash, feedback and time the final product is sure to impress.PS: You get to throw rocks... Any SWTOR Shadow needs to get this game like NOW!!!"

It's possible the game would have been rather better for me if it had beenaboutthe puzzles instead of boring combat against swarms of boring enemies.NEUTRALDated graphics - only a con if you want AAA visuals.Railroading - the world isn't openThe plot and characters are forgettableCONVoice acting is cringeworthy.Inaccurate physics in a game where the physics is vital to gameplayControls are... slippery? I think that's the word for it. Hard to explain, but controls sometimes react slowly, and other times suddenly.Surpsingly demanding on hardware for an older graphics style.Combat is repetitive and dull. Youcanbe creative, but the game encourages you to just bash everything with whatever is handy."

I have no idea, but I could speculate that whatever API is used for controller support was messing up the mouse controls. (all Unity 4 games seem to have this bug, the first time you start the game the mouse is broken)Ok, so it seems to work now. Here goes a quicky review:I haven't played through all of the single player yet, but the game offers very nice and colorful graphics with very interresting effects. Yay for sand waves! Audio sounds fantastic. I'm very excited to play through this game now! Gameplay is a 3rd person view and a magic system that is easy to use. It's quite hard to describe, but very easy to learn the basics.Impressive for early access and since I got the mouse working I'm changing this to big thumbs up.The only thing I'm missing is more than four players for online games, but hey, four is better than zero, which is what many indie games offer. (network code is hard, really hard)Looking forward to a full release and seeing how Stillalive studios will continue to develop this really interresting game idea. ^_^EDIT: got more gametime in and the single player mode is EXACTLY how you introduce players to new games and hook them. BRILLIANT!"
76561198089077755,Recommended,264000,15153976,"Posted: 1 April, 2015",all,Geeketiquette,"A great Indie title which I have owned for a while now. From a fairly small team comes this title which allows you to terraform, use telekinesis and manipulate your environment to swing things in your favour! Multi-platform, extensive co-op/multiplayer modes as well as co-op story mode with lots of challenging levels and puzzles. Combine magical powers with your friends and make fire tornados! Who wouldn't want to be able to use their mind to throw boulders at your enemies' head?Gameplay?The gameplay reminds me a lot like Jedi Academy while the visuals and the feel of the game makes me think of Stargate, Indiana Jones and Prince of Persia. Not a bad combination! It forces you to think about your surroundings and the abilities you have to hand in order to defend yourself. Unlike a lot of action-adventure games, you don't wield weapons but have to use elements and take advantage of your surroundings. You can kind of use weapons, but not physically hold a spear, but take it from a Sarahul's hand (the bad guys in this game, like big lizard men) and throw it right back at them. There is also freedom to choose different paths as to how you're going to proceed to your goal. Are you going to go stealth? Go in blazing and take on an army of lizard guys? Flank strategically with your friends? Up to you. For an Indie game title, it's not as linear as you would expect. I believe there is roughly 12+ hours of gameplay available single player and/or co-op, plus PvP arenas and a few other multiplayer game modes.Cool stuff, GADGETS!Another thing which really caught my eye was the amount of gadgets you can use in this game. It's compatible with Oculus Rift (although I believe there are some tweeks needed), Tobii EyeX which is an eye sensor bar and finally, EPOC Emotive which enables you to almost literally control the game with your mind! Other than being awesome features, it really broadens the market to other avid gamers who may not be so physically able to enjoy games. Having eyetracker software, and being able to train your hardware to the thought patterns of your brain is truly astonishing. Again, I don't know of many Indie games that enable you to do this. So kudos to Stillalive Studios!Overall?Well, I can't be the judge of this game only you can. With anything I would always advise to check out some gameplay of something first and this would be no exception. I personally think it's a really cool little game and a bit of a diamond in the rough. The team at Stillalive have been awesome to everyone by listening to feedback, developer diaries to keep you up to date with changes and to give you a chance to express your views whether they're positive or negative. You can tell a lot of hard work and love went into this title and even if the game isn't your cup of tea, you'd still want to support the developers."

There are too few games that have local co-op in campaign mode to be picky. I played 2 hours with a friend, and it was good fun.But, as a single player game, Son of Nor just isn't worth the time when there are so many better single player games out there.The gameplay is dull. There's only one tactic effective against each type of enemy, and only a few different types of enemies. Telekinesis, which doesn't require mana and is available from the start, is the easiest way to kill most enemies, so there's very little reason to use the spells that cost mana.The story is not very interesting. I feel like a lot of it was lost in translation, because there just isn't much there. It alludes to there being a lot more lore that wasn't explained. Also, I have no idea what happened in the ending - did my charactersave his people, or cause the destruction of the world, or was it a cliffhanger? I have no idea. It just cut to credits.As a better alternative to Son of Nor, I recommend the game ""Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers"". It has similar telekinesis-style mechanics, but is MUCH more fun and it has a coherent story."

I think the graphics are really good for an indie 3d game. the sound, music and voice recording is top notch though! I have just played a couple of hours so far, so I haven’t finished the single player campaign yet, but I already love the implementation of how you can use different powers. you can terraform your surroundings to your advantage (for example by lowering or elevating sand) or in order to solve a puzzle and use telekinesis to throw things around and fight against enemies. there are also some magical spells you learn later on. it is the balance between action, puzzles, and exploring that makes son of nor so good."
,Recommended,264000,11458823,"Posted: 28 July, 2014",all,JLEV,"Even  though I've only played just over a couple of hours of this game, I enjoyed it and decided to make it the first game I actually do a series on for my YouTube channel.Son of Nor has some interesting elements to it that you just don't find in other games, and I was even more surprised to see an option for local split screen gaming; which is a rarity to find on modern day PC games.I also enjoyed the fact that there is terraforming in this game and it works surprisingly well for the current build. I wish more games had a terraforming element to them and not be based around the 'God' genre.Here are my first impressions and overall commentary of the first few stages of Son of Nor:http://youtu.be/A0NyWe6sw1AEven though this is only an early access game, the amount of content and game that is actually playable still warrants a solid playthrough and will most likely fill up most of your day if you're just a casual gamer looking for something new and out of your normal genre.REVIEW UPDATE:There are a few areas that need to be worked and these are as followed: (IMO)Textures: Some aren't too bad but they could use with some blending in some areas, such as rock faces and areas where the textures are tiled could use some blending or realigning.Character/s: Character models could use some work with their motion/s and the main character needs eyelids to blink. Them eyes are popping out of his head at the moment.Memory: I'm not sure why a game of this calibre needs to use much memory! I have 16Gb of 2400Mhz RAM and this game uses 1.5-2.0Gb on idle doing nothing at all but inside the in game menu. Memory optimization needs to occur.Support/Fixes Needed:- Starting the game for the first time does run it in fullscreen, however the Fullscreen option in the menu is not ticked/activated.- Support for greater resolutions higher than 1920x1080 (Full HD). With the current immersion of 4K and Ultrawide displays hitting the market, resolutions need to be bumbped up or supported if possible. I myself have an Ultrawide monitor with a resolution of 2560x1080 and aspect ration of 21:9.- Selecting the preset graphic quality from the current drop down menu is somewhat of pot luck. If you select the 'Fantastic' quality option and then accidently select 'Beautiful', some fiddling needs to be done in order have the 'Fantastic' graphic option appear again- Some Dialogue needs to fixed to make it easier to understand who is talking- Some collectibles cannot be collected"

The engine didn't seem quite able to keep up with the physics, the environments seemed created with a toolkit of some sort, and the hit detection never quite worked as expected.  The game does feel inspired, however, and was a valiant effort.  In addition, some of the puzzles in the game are quite clever.  These positives can't quite overcome the unpolished feel of the entire game."

I was able to get across the abyss in the caves (of where the antharis egg is.) by maknig a bridge with my telepathic abiltities but there was no"" lesson"" on how to do this at least not a CLEAR explanation on how to do it. The minimum specs for this game are far to unrealistic I am playing with a fx63000 gtx 1050 2gb and the framerate is so varied from as low as 25 to 60! you seldom hear your avatar speak except THIS IS THE WAY I CAME FROM!! lolnow the negatives are out of the way THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED and I must have played near 100 different games over the years..  It was long-very long and well worth the money. The story well thought out and unique  with good characters and good chosen names for each of them - noldric etc.  I liked the various range of paces too - sometimes the game required your quickness on the controls for instance when fighting  at other times you are  free to explore at your leasure. you always know what you need to do next so theres no pointless wandering (unless you WANT to freely explore). it reminded me of the ""myst"" and ""uru"" franchise (regarding mainly the scenery) but with  available powers and alot of ""action"". Its also Like ""uru"" in that you can choose what your avatar will wear and receive at certain points in the game such as an arm shield , you can also choose male or female. The music is beautiful and really  projects the correct atmosphere and changes pace very well when needed.  compatible with EMOTIV ,OCULAS RIFT and EYE TRACKER. hope there is a son of nor 2  sometime soon."

It feels like a casual game in a 3D world. If you like the Prince of Persia series, you could probably get into this game. The puzzle aspect is a lot of fun (most of the time). One of my favorite things is feeling like a sand version of Silver Surfer (closest thing I can compare it to). This game was not only fun, but also unique.

The problem is that the game doesn't really do anything with those elements.  One would expect a game where you can raise and lower ground and move objects around with the power of your mind to have a bunch of puzzles and secret areas right? nope, puzzles are few and far between and the secret areas are generaly eather scenic roads to the objective (pretty to look at but otherwise boring) or small caves with some collectable or another.There is some story but it's pretty bare bone unless you want to spend time translating the game's invented alphabet. I found it too tedious to do so.The combat is where the game actually gets my recomendation. Its fun throwing enemies around, launching huge burning rocks at them, using wind to blow them off cliffs, ect. Indeed the sadistic will find plenty of ways to creatively dispatch creatures trying to kill them.Objects in the environment break in a rather satisfying way the levels are rather pretty in my opinion but are rather short often leaving you asking ""oh we are done already?"".Overall it is a fun game but it isn't going to wow you."

,Recommended,264000,15301872,"Posted: 10 April, 2015",all,Sethander Wald,"So after playing this game shortly after launch on Linux, I have to say, that even though I have not tested it under windows, 30-40 fps with a GTX 970 just doesn't seem right. However, I would still say this game is well worth the price. While the story/dialogue is somewhat confusing, the actual gameplay elements are truly one of a kind. The combat takes some getting used to, but overall, it really is a unique experience. Launching sharp/heavy objects from your surroundings at your enemy can be quite exhilarating, but also having the option to bury them in sand, or drop them off a cliff makes for some interesting styles of fighting. Having no UI is actually implemented quite well in my opinion, and turning to sand to indicate losing health actually feels natural. But where this game really shines is with the puzzles. It makes excellent use of telekinesis, and while some of the puzzles can be a bit confusing at first, once you realize what you're supposed to be doing, they actually have some very clever designs.  Overall, this game does have some rough edges, but for the $20 asking price, I'd say it's money well spent. and if you can get it on sale, then I say definitely grab this game. There really isn't anything else quite like it."

I guess I'm stuck with it in my library regardless.  The reasons why it disgusted me are substantially the same as @Edgewalker's, with additions.  The moment when I realized I was done was a scene/level/whatever where I was supposed to ""seek shelter"" and there was no guidance or hint whatsoever AND there was an unstoppable enormous monster waiting to ambush me.  Also, the game has no compass, no minimap, no sense of direction in a game where sense of direction is critical.  The only way one can learn what needs to be done or where to go is to simply experiment wildly and die repeatedly until one gets it right.  Last time I checked, dying in the real world is an abrupt end to learning.  I don't find it any more entertaining in a game than I would in real life.  Dying is a final resounding failure; one doesn't learn from that."

Although it has some very dated graphics, anyone can look at it and say 'hey, that looks like it could be fun', and they'd be right.Son of Nor has moments at which I really enjoy myself. But they are few and far between. The game seems dead-set on forcing it's users on trudging through poorly designed levels, plagued with poorly designed puzzles that halt the otherwise interesting action component of the game.The multiplayer can bring some enjoyment to the table as well, but it's just fluff--there isn't any portion of the game that I truly felt like it would benefit from having another player accompany me through. The levels are small, and that is only hidden by the sea of barely understandable puzzles that seem to be designed to not engage the player, but instead hinder their progress.I think there's a lot of good ideas in this game, some of which are executed quite well.

Early on in the game, the player encounters an enemey camp that they must go through to get a powerup. Unfortunately, this is next to impossible, as the frames drop to less than 1/s due to the never-ending river of enemies that poors out. The menues are literally unreadable on anything but the highest quality setting, and since when is a minimum requirement of an nVidia 8800 a reasonable design descision? 8800's and higher should be for those players who want to get a little extra oomph out of the visuals, they should never be the base requriement. Based on the promotional videos, it seems like the devs spent thier time getting the game to work with some (admittedly really cool peripherals) when they should have been spent it to make the game run at more than 10 fps whenever there are any number of enemies on screen. I'll end on a positive note: the terraforming feature is a lot of fun, and the story sound incredible. I just hope that the devs optimize the game so that its playable."

The concepts behind the gameplay could have been good, but the premise is trumped by the presentation. Clunky controls, worse camera, unoriginal lore (humans are nearly extinct because of a race of evil whatsits that enslaved them long ago, hide in the desert, lizard men still hunt them for no reason blah blah), boring visuals with graphics reminiscent of the original Black and White (character models as jagged as the cliffs that restrict your movement). Just a bad game in every way but the physics based combat and enviromental control idea, but that is put into action so poorly you'll wish you just had a way to punch your foes on the nose. It'd be more effective.I also suggest everyone flag the Character Action tag as being applied incorrectly. This is in no way a part of that genre."

I played 10 more minutes and removed from library.  The game is awful.  Terraforming is clunky and tedious... i went through every battle simply holding shift and clicking and killing everything.  Subtitles will have exclamation points, while the voice actor simply talks with no emotion. (except for Tanath, his voice acting is pretty decent).  There is ZERO enjoyment here.  My original  review still stands.I played the tutorial, or some of it, i dunno... i played for 20 minutes.  I got bored and turned it off, to me it just seems like a kids game or something.  Cheesey art, Cheesey story.  All i did was Pick up a rock, throw it somewhere.... Pick up a person, throw him somewhere...Pick up everything, throw it all somewhere.  Which, even MAYBE that would be fun, except that it looks super lame when you do it.  You don't feel like your smashing anything, or really destroying anything, everything feels light, physics feel off, FPS bogs constantly.   Its like a dull platformer from the N64 days lol. (not graphic-wise, just boring wise lol).  Granted, i only played for 20 minutes, but to be honest, i kind of expect to be ""captured"" by a game in the first 20 at least enoughto to want to dig in a little more , enough to want to continue to learn it, and play it at least.  The devs seem real nice though, reading through other comments, they seem anxious to hear feedback and seem very professional.  So maybe this gets patched into something better.

,Not Recommended,264000,15221462,"Posted: 5 April, 2015",all,Deadroad,"Firstly I would like to say that this game had some good concepts and ideas, if were not poorly executed- this game had great potential and generally would not be poor in terms of gameplay, mechanics, performance, dialogue, transitioning; these are the core elements in which should be top quality in a video game.After playing an hour, attempting to fix an issue of lag, bare in mind my GPU is above the recommended yet it seems to be the case where my GPU is running at maximum capabilities in terms of memory and shader allocations; and yet I still have an issue with framerate and ligthing. I even lowered my resolutions from 1920x1200 to 1280x720, yet still the issue persue.  More on the topic of graphical issues, the 'telekanesis' ability when picking up rocks, in fact anything you pick up has a glitchty outer texture, whether that was supposed to be some sort of glowing effect- I do not know, but it was not well executed either way.Okay, enough about performance issues and graphics, more onto the gameplay. Do not get me the wrong, the story has a good concept just the characters seem too wooden, emotionless and the whole dialogue just seems to be cliche, typical. The transitions seems to be unnatrual, with instancing between certain areas of the level you are on, meaning you get a loading screen for fixed points in the level. Most items you can control with your abilities, along with shaping the ground with terraforming, I believe that due to most things be prerendered, you get a lot of lag on the start of levels.Combat is poor, I was expecting good combat with these great concepts, but mostly the AI is poor and enemies are too easy to deal with after playing 3 levels there is no challenge present (I am also playing on hard difficulty). And NPCs do most of the killing for you, which again, ruins the experience.In conclusion, I would not recommend this game- it was a great idea but sadly was not expressed or brought out upon it's full potential. Which is a shame."

Could it have been done better? Yes. Would I have this many hours in the game if I didn't speedrun it? No.The mechanics of using terraforming and telekenesis to solve puzzles and navigate levels is pretty unique and fun. When I first played the game I spent tons of time with friends in coop just trying to glitch to areas and cheese puzzles with the mechanics. Standing under boxes and launching myself hundreds of feet in the air and using coop to create elevator systems to get around the maps was awesome.The game doesn't look the best and could be optimized better, these are true, but for a small company's first game as the result of a kickstarter it could be worse. The game seems to be made to show off the mechanics of (then)current VR and eye tracking hardware, I'm sure the game is cool with that equipment but the majority of the userbase will not have them and it's best to focus on that. I never have crashes or anything and the game runs near perfect on my PC(the sand can be stressful on some computers at times). I do hang on load menus into between levels and am sometimes forced to click, have the program go unresponsive and wait for prompt to click ""wait for the program"" then the game will load. It doesn't happen super often at all. Just something I've noticed.The campaign will give you a small 6-10 hours of gameplay and the multiplayer is 100% dead, which is slightly disappointing for $20, but I'd say it's well worth it just to mess around with the physics engine. If the game is on sale it'd be a shame not to grab it.Overall would I recommend this game?Yes."

The game also seems to fail to register some button presses and the default keymap is completely wrong (ie instructions on the screen do not relate to the default button map).I have also tried the game windows (with the same xbox360 controller) and it was a completely different experience. Buttons are mapped correctly and the controller worked perfectly. I doubt this game was designed with a gamepad in mind though as it still feels a bit clunky and my fingers were having to do a lot of work just to run,jump, and move the camera at the same time.  Some sort of camera follow option might fix this.That said once I had it running the gameplay seems quite fun, the plot is interesting enough and the puzzles kept me challenged at the right levelI also tried it with the Oculus Rift DK2 (I know its alpha) and found it completely unplayable as I could not get head tracking working.  Based on the resolution it sets up I suspect this might be build to support the DK1 instead.I still have hope that this will be a fun game however due to the controller issues I experienced I cant recommend it to anyone that wants to play on Linux."
