,Recommended,264060,30956165,Posted: 4 April,all,pulse_prophet,"Kind of reminds me of FEZ. Might seem short, but gives you a lot to explore and piece together. Puzzles are actually complex and kind of diverse, very challenging and can be frustrating at times so some patience is needed. The controls can get weird especially when climbing or going over edges, but manageable. The visuals it's nice, moody, and has uh ""environmental storytelling"", can get repetitive for too long. Overall, it's a great game, very recommended."
,Recommended,264060,23839029,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,Jewel,"This game is absolutely incredible. There's a lot of depth hidden under the surface and it's a really big surprise on just how solid the game is. It's one of those games with simple mechanics and endless permutations on creating puzzles with them, throwing in new elements once in a while.Basically, the gist is, it's an open world puzzle platformer which is heavily reminiscent of La-Mulana and Fez, with gameplay similar to.. Blocks That Matter, in a way? If you liked any of those titles, I say there's a pretty good chance you'll like this one too. And not to turn this into a review for other games, but if youhaven'tplayed any of those titles, please do!Anyway, if a game is this reminiscent of the best parts of some of my favorite titles I've ever played, I can't help but give this a favorable review."

There is no jump button, instead you solve environmental puzzles through digging, bashing, climbing, pushing, etc.  A few sections have some timing elements but you should be well prepared once you encounter them.  There is also a smartly implemented rewind system so you can correct any missteps you might have made.  Has a large map with varied environments.  Shortcuts eventually open up to alieve some backtracking issues.  Charming pixel art with only one character sprite I had a difficult time discerning what I was looking at.  Interesting game world and a story keeps things moving, with a few twists, but doesn't really get in the way of the gameplay.  Particularly good soundtrack as well.  Followed this all the way from Greenlight and is one of the best experiences out of that system.  Played on a shared account (close to 50 hrs for all but two achievements) for reference."
,Recommended,264060,23337353,"Posted: 1 June, 2016",all,Frostilyte,"Full Bore is the kind of game where everything feels like it was really well thought out. The central concept of the game is solving puzzles while you explore the game's world. Along the way you collect gems and read about the lore of the events that happened leading up to the present time within the game. Because of some excellent puzzle design and well paced introduction of new puzzle mechanics the game never felt boring to me. Full Bore also features a time travel mechanic that lets you undo the last number of things you've done as well as soft resetting the current puzzle you are working on. This alone helped make what would have been frustrating and tedious puzzle solving into fun and difficult puzzle solving. Only major gripes with the game are that you have to re-solve a number of puzzles when you go through a previously explored area for some, but not all areas. This is exacerbated by the lack of a clear map and very conservative fast travel locations, which make traveling to certain locations to clear out the map a bit of a pain. Overall I quite enjoyed Full Bore."

,Recommended,264060,29639109,Posted: 1 February,all,Geolian,"This game is a hidden gem (pun not intended?).Controls are simple, but tight. Don't expect to get any special abilites or to level up. The variations in gameplay come from the levels, and there's way more variation than you'd think when you start. Except for a couple of optional puzzles, no puzzle is unfair. They're well thought out, some of them giving you face-palming epiphanies when you finally get how they work.The story though...oh man. You can finish the game in less than 10 hrs if you don't care for the story or to complete all the puzzles. But you'd be doing yourself a diservice, beyond the fact that it's worth it to actually play the puzzles. Without spoilers, this story of a mining boar goes deep. It deals with philosophy, religion, quantum physics... There's a neat mystery that you can put together if you take the time to do it.Definitely recommend it. One of the few games in recent memory that I felt compelled to complete to its true end."
76561198152758511,Recommended,264060,33663742,Posted: 19 July,all,Thunderstar0,"There are many mysteries in this world. One of them is the lack of attention Full Bore has gotten, since it’s such a great Metroidvania puzzle game.You play as a boar in a mine populated by talking boars. You’re in debt and you need to repay it by finding blue gems hidden all over the map. There’s also lore to find that will tell why the boars closed off an area of the mines, and who left all these computers and junk everywhere.The puzzles are all block pushing puzzles. There are blocks that do different things and you are going to hate the ones that disintegrate after you climb on top of them. Some puzzles are optional, which is a good thing since these puzzles are not of the easy, obvious sort. You will get frustrated and will probably look up a guide to solve them, and then you will slap yourself in the head because now it feels obvious(which is the mark of a good puzzle game). Don’t expect powerups of any sort. There aren’t any. However, you can go faster by digging into the same type of block multiple times. There’s a rewind function where you go back into the past so you can redo your moves. This is extremely helpful.The game has good controls. You can climb, stomp, push things, and there’s a delay when you go over a block since you might not want to change your position just yet.The music for this game is very good too, and I came back to the ost multiple times and looked up Adjective Plural Noun, the band that made it. At some point I’ll buy the ost.The art’s pleasing. It’s pixel art, but it’s got it’s own style and isn’t trying to look like other games.I don’t have any problems with the game, but I’m not a nitpicker.The 40 hours I've spent on this game should also be a testament to its worth."

,Recommended,264060,10239394,"Posted: 26 May, 2014",all,Attilion,"Full Bore feels like a metroidvania game but it is more of a platform-puzzle game. You will not get any power-up (none that matters, anyhoof) and you will have to rely on simple mechanics to dig through the game. The gameplay is solid, the puzzles vary in difficulty and originality ; you will not get boared.The lenght of the game is simply astounding with ""only"" four worlds, you will have to rack your brain for hours just to realize you've done only half the game has to offer. The fact that the overall design and animations are top notch will make you go back for more.However, some puzzles rely more on experimentation than logic (which can get frustrating at times) and most of the ""hidden"" stuff is too cryptic with mechanics that are never explained, requiring external help or real patience in trying many different things until one works. Furthermore, the music is a tad bit on the repetitive side and sometimes doesn't work well when you need to think straight. Finally, the final boss fight (which can be accessed under certain conditions) may be a little unfair with a limited rewind function, making a single mistake costly.These are tiny flaws, easy to get by, and you should not let that prevent you from buying this great game."

And it's a good one, really.Instead of jumping, you have to climb over blocks and use your brains (a lot) to solve puzzles in order to continue.This game is also a lot of exploration, which feels like FEZ (it even has a reference to it), a few secrets to be found, and hidden locations to discover (but, like FEZ, you know if a room has been completed by looking at the map, which helps).+ Free exploration world+ A great variety of crates to climb over+ Many puzzles, with scaling difficulty (some at the end are really hard)+ Map helps a lot and is very precise in its details+ Possibility to go back in time if you made a mistake+ Boar character (and boar puns)- Rewinding time will sometimes work well, erasing your last move, and sometimes make you go back to the beginning of the level because no ""checkpoints"" have been set since (I don't know how checkpoints are set, though)All in all, it's a great game, worth its price"
76561197993154730,Recommended,264060,24353750,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Argyle Sox,"Pros:+Open-World Exploration with many secrets to find+Perfect Difficulty+Great Music+Detailed story with multiple endings+Perfect difficulty on virtually all the puzzlesCons:- I encountered one bug that would have prevented me from getting two achievements, but it randomly awarded credit for solving the puzzle (QR Code) after I reentered the room after beating the game.- In the beginning there's a character who tells you to go somewhere, and doesn't give directions how to get there.  I don't want a highlighted minimap or something, but it makes sense for him to say go through the top corner, etc.- There is one puzzle that involves a QR code.  It's a reference to Fez.I had a great time with Full Bore.  I bought it expecting just another puzzle platformer, but it's much more than that.  It's a free-roaming open world exploration game, like Metroid without the enemies.  This means it's probably closer to Fez than any other game, but I enjoyed it more because it generally avoids  esoteric puzzles that require out of game knowledge.  The main mechanic of the game is digging in unstable soil, which will be familiar to anyone who played Steamworld Dig.  It works just as well here, but unlike Steamworld Dig you're expected to backtrack if you want to explore and the whole map isn't digging.The music is great, the story is surprisingly complex, it has multiple endings but you can play after the two to three of them, and NPCs acknowledge your success.  All in all, I highly recommend for fans of 2D puzzle games."

76561198042757315,Not Recommended,264060,33737844,Posted: 22 July,all,SamuraiCupcake,"I'll be straight forward :Pros:- Cool artstyle as seen in video and screenshot - retro pixelart. Cute but nothing amazing.- Lotsa exploration to do, if that's your thing. The world is pretty massive and its not linear. Many roadblocks though.- Many, decent puzzles. Makes up the bulk of the gameplay, so puzzles fans will be happy.- Relaxing ambience and atmosphere. The lighting effects are really good and make a nice mood.Cons:- Lack of direction. I would often get lost or stuck and unsure where/what to do. A lot of backtracking. Not so fun.- Story is incoherent and did nothing to really engage me. Characters spout a lot of unimportant dialog. Player character (a hog) has no personality (blank slate)- No voice acting. Seeing as there are many NPCs and they have several lines, its a real shame.- Many puzzles are frustrating and block progress. Could not be bothered to finish some the harder ones after many tries.- Too many dead-ends and empty rooms. No powerups. No special collectibles to mention. Lacks rewards in general.- Lacks combat or action. Only a con if you like that to be part of your game, which I do, at least a little bit.I personnaly regret my purchase, but only because I got frustrated by the puzzles and unrewarding exploration, and backtracking. If you love puzzles, especially hard ones, and don't need a relevant story, nor combat/action, then you'll like it. It's casual.For a similar experience, one which I personnally prefered, see Steamworld Dig."

,Not Recommended,264060,17018761,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,eldee,"Really wanted to like this.. but there are some fundamental design flaws that really prevent me from playing it anymore. It's virtually impossible to determine areas where you're able to drop down to lower areas, so you'll spend a lot of time frustrated in an area where there's no apparent way to proceed, only to accidentally press down and drop through the floor.Other irritations- the game doesn't really tell you what type of materials you can dig into.. dirt, okay. stone- apparently?? I spent way too much time stuck in one area only to find that I could dig through solid rock. Apparently not metal though, or thin beams. I just doesn't make any sense and the game doesn't help you understand whats going on (either through color coding, highlighting, or even a frickin tutorial).The last major flaw is the ham fisted time-rewind mechanic that seems to exist solely to correct other design flaws (the fact that you can get stuck in the first place). It's not like Braid where it's crucial to solving puzzles, it's just there as an ""undo button"" which is pretty lame.As a side note and unrelated to my overall experience of the game (because I turned it off), the music was god awful. sounded like a couple of kids 'jamming' in the garage. Just.. awful.Anyway, if it's on sale and you're curious go for it.. otherwise save your money."

76561198022820771,Not Recommended,264060,10040270,"Posted: 6 May, 2014",all,SocioPsycho,"Full Bore is a platformer/ digger with some small puzzle attached, style of game, with very limited low key story attached. The elements of platforming in this game are limited, and do not allow you to jump or try to get where you want as you want. They manged to make a game that is about jumping and digging feel liner in jumping and digging. Your choices in what you can do are already made for you when you enter a area. If you mess up in any way or die its easy to undo it with no consequence, your actions don't matter in any way. With how much depth this game is lacking I found it a bore to play, and while you may not, recommending this game that is going for $15 at time of this review is impossible. If you really want it then at least wait for it to go on sale under $10.
