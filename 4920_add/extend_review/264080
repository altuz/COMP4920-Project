76561198121593039,Recommended,264080,9923133,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,yousingthehits,"I remember seeing this game from Warehouse Clearence Shops when I was about 13 for around £2.99. It was a toss up between a game called H.E.D.Z. Extreme Destruction Zone and this and I bought this. From the outset the game seemed simple, drive around In vehicles fitted guns trying to shoot other vehicles. However the game designers had other Ideas.I remember reading the booklet over and over and still not grasping what the point of the game was, it has to be one of the weirdest freakin' games I've played in terms of storyline and strange language. I really liked the graphics everything bar the vehicles looks like its made out of that Magic Sand stuff that stays dry under water and seems to shimmer and flush luminous colours. There are always things crawling over and under the surface like the ladscape is some giant, lumpy moth-eaten rug and you meet these creatures on a seperate screen who you interact with and buy stuff from who just make no sense at all and seem to live inside an advent calendar for no reason. And then you die. Over the years My copy fell victim to numerous scratches and became unplayable, when I saw that this game was on steam I thought I had to play it again. I think I have to agree with the description that mos of the pleasure that is to be had in this game is trying to work out what exactly whats going on and what you are supposed to do. You are kind of learning a foreign language with this game, but I think that's what gives the game it's appeal for me. It is a genuine oddity, a one off freak that you may never fully understand. And that is what has brought me here. Maybe I seek some sort of closure on what has been puzzling me for some time: Vangers, what was that all about?"
76561197988012862,Recommended,264080,9923792,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,mendel,"1998 was the year ofGrand Theft Auto(the original one with the top-down view),Planet of death(pod)andVangers. Vangers didn't catch on much back then, because there wasn't any genre it fit. Even if it does some things similarly to GTA (open world top-down driving game with missions and unstructured gameplay), its premise and game world are much more confusing, and most reviewers and players couldn't warm up to it, though some did. (Actually, that probably hasn't changed.)What sets Vangers apart?Voxels: Vangers has been implemented with a voxel-like world (that was before the prevalence of polygon-crunching graphics cards), which means that the terrain doesn't have a surface made of textured polygons, but is sculpted out of tiny cubes (like square pixels make up a digital photograph, but in 3D). (Think minecraft with finer grains.)  This means that you can deform the terrain: vehicles leave tracks, weapons make craters, you can move under water, through tunnels (sometimes hard to spot in the top-down view) and, with the right equipment, even burrow along like a mole. Unfortunately, this is also the reason why Vangers still runs at 800x600: if you upped the resolutions, either everything would be very small, or the Voxels would appear larger, and everything would still be blocky.SciFi: Vangers is set in a confusing world, or rather a ""Chain"" of worlds (do read the ""preface"" eventually), with seasons that affect gameplay, weird installations, the purpose of which is initially unknown, and strange creatures that talk in riddles. You need to discover much of  the gameplay as you go along.So how do you get a feel for the game? Review the controls in the options - you will need to move, turn your vehicle over and use the KiD a lot. Set the game to fullscreen. Then click yourself (somewhat to the right) through the prologue into the buying screen, pick up a shipment of Nymbos, exit the burrow, click on the lower right panel to set your compass for Incubator, and take off. (I set my camera to zoom and tilt, but not to rotate, because  it is very easy to get disoriented.) You'll find that with your small, lightweight car, terrain matters a lot. There are roads, some obvious, some not so much, and unfortunately, you need to stay out of the way of stronger Vangers for the time being. Reach Incubator, sell the Nymbos, get some Phlegma, trade it back to Podish, buy better cars and equipment, ask the councellors about the things you saw, figure out how they work and how to reach other worlds in the chain, take part in races, take down other Vangers and loot them, become a motorized Scifi mercenary.If you like off-road driving and can keep going in the  face of confusion (and if you don't mind a time machine trip back to when screens had 15"", 640x480 was a good game resolution, and 800x600 looked definitely wonderful - and games had to ask before saving 64MB of persistent world),Vangerswill reward you with huge and deep world full of surprises -- and driving.I can safely say that there hasn't been any game like Vangers since 1998, because if there had been, I would have played it. (Hard Truck Apocalypse, also published by Buka, comes close, but it doesn't have voxel terrain and isn't nearly as strange as Vangers.) I'm very happy that it has been overhauled to run on modern systems.P.S.: I just found my old Vangers mousepad with the yellow and blue liquid and the floating mechos!--------------------I just wrote the following in a forum post, it may help inform your buying decision.So some people may be thinking, ""that's an interesting game, but chances are high I won't like it much"" and then conclude that they'll buy it if it ever goes below 4$ or whatever. Those of us who know and love Vangers know the game is worth more to us, but I can understand that people who are curious are reluctant to buy.In that regard, if you like top-down off-road racing, with small vulnerable vehicles that can roll over and right themselves and do both small and really long jumps with a built-in spring device that charges up, you probably won't regret buying this for the full price, because if you get frustrated with the alien SciFi, you'll be able to just go and tool around the area some more in your mecho and have fun."

There are always different ways to complete goals. If you want money - you can complete quests, trade, or rob secret stashes. If you want to go to the next world - you can complete a difficult race, or prove you are worthy by some other way.Graphics look awesome, despite the game's old age, thanks to voxel engine which makes everything look even more alien.On the downside - ingame quests are very difficult. Sometimes you will even get tasks, which are impossiple to complete on the current stage of storyline. Offroad driving is nearly impossible, your car will not just go slower or stop  - it will spin uncontrollably whith the slightest press of a button."

The only thing you know about Vangers is that they are a kind of warrior created by something called ""the infinite mind"" in a world that just makes no sense... or does it... You'll be taking nymbos to Feenger at Incubator and taking part in the holy race, the ""Eleection"" where you must ride to Podish in your Mechos while carrying your own Eleepod, exploring the worlds of the chain, collecting plenty of beebs, assisting the Eleepods, or beeboorats, or the zeexen to fulfill their dark, existential quest to collect the larvae from which they are mutated...Gameplay-wise, this is an RPG/Racing/Open-World/Sandbox game the likes of which have not been replicated since this games conception in 1998.I saw other reviewers say this game is like learning a language... and it definitely is.It's a strange and esoteric experience. One that so many should definitely experience.I'd been trying to get this game to work again for years, only to recently discover a steam version was released this year. And for only $6, you cannot go wrong.I would pay $20 for this game...TL;DR please buy this game and discuss it with me because I've never had anybody to discuss this game and it's messed up story with before and I need that so badly you have no idea"

This game has never been surpassed by any other in terms of how the world is thought through, plot, atmosphere and gameplay.I know that outside of Russia it was not successful back in 1998, primary because the game was non-format at that time and it was not understood. It was true indie game which came an epoch before these games bacame mainstream. And now, when the time for such games finally came, I am glad to see it republished for wide variety of people.By the way, I still have soundtracks from Vangers in my playlist."

76561198046974550,Recommended,264080,31532315,Posted: 3 May,all,noxadari,"This is my first review, and I just felt I had to, after reading all the negative ones.First off, addressing all the negative reviews.Nearly every single one that I read was about the graphics, and the rest about the ""unintuitive interface"".Yes, the color palette is not the greatest, it has given me a headache a few times back when I originally played it in 1999, though that could also have been from the fact of the twelve to thirteen hour gaming sessions I did back then.  It is not a beautiful game by any means, but to say it has bad graphics is nowhere even close to correct.  It was made to have a max resolution of 800x600, and to upscale that for HD would probably be easier to just make a brand new game based off the old one.As for the interface, it is not unintuitive in the least.  Click right arrow, move to a different screen.  Click the disk, save, etc.  I saw several people complaining that there is no play button...""new game""  and ""load game"", seems intuitive enough.And third, it is not an easy game that holds your hand.  Many years ago, and probably a lot of older gamers are forgetting this, but games didn't used to have a tutorial at the start of every level to explain a new mechanic, you had to figure it out yourself, or just get thrown into the game with little/no explanation of what to do in general.  This is a hard game to learn and play, and I have raged many many times, reloading a much earlier save and losing several hours of progress...not yet this time around but it is coming.I would and will always recommend this game, for the nostalgia, for the challenge, and for the ugly weird color scemes, and also for the insane phrases."

This is both it's strong point and it's weak point since the vast majority of the story comes in cryptic dialogue but once you decypher what is going on, you're in for the ride of a lifetime.This is a good example of a great game that withstood the test of time, and the current generation could benefit from playing a game such as this, where deep plot points and unpredictable gameplay merge in a form of art we call vangers.keep in mind, it's a little weird, even for those used to these kinds of games, but in the end, you'll thank yourself for picking this up."

The universe is amazing, gameplay is just thrilling. It's like ELITE+Carmageddon+LSD. Just masterpiece.If you liked Vangers and in good terms with RTS, I would also recommend checking the Perimeter game from the same developers. One of the most original RTS of all times."
76561198330761980,Recommended,264080,30445633,Posted: 11 March,all,Jin Hsien,"As you may have already guessed from the mixed reviews, Vangers is not everyone's cup of tea. It's a bit like a video game equivalent of a Gene Wolfe novel. A lot of bizzare situations and objects described in a convoluted, difficult language. If your first reaction is ""why make things purposefully difficult and convoluted?!"", don't buy this game. If, on the other hand, you're intrigued and are ready to persevere, there's... still some annoying stuff you need to confront!First of all, do take a look at the trailer and the screenshots available on the net. I've never had a problem with the visuals here, but apparently some people do. Worlds here have seasons, each with its own color scheme, so you can't really see everything during your first 20 minutes or so. Secondly, the original came with a hefty manual which explained a lot of what you see on the screen. Without it, you'll probably have to spend a bit of time figuring out where the buttons are, such as going to the shop (bottom right), leaving (top left), proceeding with the dialogue (top right), saving (yellow circle). The default controls are absolutely terrible (I don't think they were this bad in the original - the devs must've botched something, or maybe I did when installing...) You don't have to change everything - just select what you like for basic things like turning, firing, opening (e.g. when approaching an escave from the surface), fullscreen, etc., and you'll figure the rest out later. I also dislike the music and just turn it off right at the start, but YMMV.For those who have trouble understanding what the game is like at all, you (a vanger) are essentially driving a vehicle (mechos), exploring alien worlds, doing some trading and errands for the locals, competing with other vangers. The plot gets really, really thick after a while - particularly after you win the favor of some of the locals, and are granted access to one or more cursed worlds, where the artifacts are. The ending is one of the most amazing things ever done in a video game, but I won't spoil it. Suffice to say that it's more than a plot twist and more of a life experience for you."

Everynow and then this is a game you can just pick up and have fun with if your anything like me. This review is all my opinion wich might be slightly biased due to nostalgianess hehe.Graphicly >_> or w.e if I mistyped : This game has aged well if you compare it to indie games from nowadays, It doesnt stutter and the specs you need are uber low. Altho I like the style it is aged so well to me check out some gameplay if your not sure but for me its gotta be: 8/10Gameplay: You have a top view car which can jump, roll, shoot, Go trough motha****** portals to explore diffrent (more hostile) worlds where you can sometimes do a small puzzle or a race for example. You gotta like the gameplay and wittyness that is in it. 9/10Story: Not a too great FORCED story.... buttttt If you take the effort to read all the dialoge you can get a clearer view, Sometimes you need  to remember a cryptic statement to ease out a later puzzle world, But overall the story is how much you want to be drawn in by it. GREAT ROLEPLAYING GAME if you are into roleplaying, as there is no real storyline thats forced so you are like a blank slate since you start a game.    7/10AN: I dont have alot to complain about this I hope FIXED version (my original NEVER would let me go trough the LAST FREAKKING PORTAL TO END IT LEGIT) apart from missing the >>>Cheatcodes<<<< and multiplayer in this release While multiplayer I can live without Replaying the game with cheats was a fun thing to do to explore stuff.Verdict: I love the style, I love the execution even now for this classic. It should still be cheaper(LIKE 2,99 MAX) for the amount of time it would take to fully clear the game on a good run(without cheats sometimes you just get stuck in a run if you cannot find the right artifacts in the worlds) But if you are looking for a Nice racing/shooter with a unique feel that so many games seem to miss nowadays this is deffinatly a good one to pick up:= 8/10 TOTAL SCORE!

I played the game extensively in the windows os;  I still have the original install disk.  Over the years I managed to get it to work on various flavours of the windows os, although in some versions of windows the graphics did not work.Then I switched to Linux and you can imagine my delight when I found a Linux version of Vangers on Steam!The Linux version is actually a little bit more difficult to play than the windows version.  There is no joystick axis support in the Linux game, and although landscape is deformable, there is no option to save the landscape to disk in the Linux version.  That means that one of the exploits I used to use to get big mechos fast no longer works in the Linux version.It doesn´t really matter.  Once you know how to collect beebs efficiently, it does not take long to make enough to get whatever mechos you want.If you are a beginner to the game, you might want to find the online manual and you might want to do a google search for vangers hints and tips.  The game will throw curve-balls at you from time to time.  They are avoidable once you know how, but to avoid them you will need experience in the game, or you will need to read a guide.In all my years of gaming, Vangers is one of the few games that captured my imagination.  If you would like to get your mind stretched a little bit, if you like exploring, if you like sandbox games then I highly recommend Vangers as a game that might be right for you.  The whole game, start to finish is a learning experience, and even after you play through a couple of times is still an enormous amount of fun.  There is so much to learn, so much to find.  I wish you a very happy  journey in the Vangers Universe."

This was in the midst of the XP era, so the original game could still be made to run.Now, it's been modified by some of the original devs to work on modern OS. It does not currently contain multiplayer, but I spoke with one of the developers, and there is currently an option called zMod, a community made multiplayer thing. More options may be coming in the future, I am very excited."

76561198124018114,Not Recommended,264080,29364115,Posted: 19 January,all,fsjj,"Mixed feelings about this game.I bought this title shortly after it came out, many years ago, and played it a bit. Never forgot its unique game design, open world style, and cryptic stories. Since then, I've been looking for longplay videos ever since, until this came along on Steam and I figured I might just try it again.And yes, something about this game still moves me. I've always read that the slow and relentless pacing of this game will reward in the end, once you get the hang of the mechanics, and get access to the other words, weapons, quests and such.Unfortunately.. a lot of design choices will result in a harsh and unforgiving experience in the first 10 hours of gameplay. The (old) game manual is a must to explain practically all mechanics, as well as the user interface and the many definitions, as they are not quite explained in the game itself.Practically NOTHING is intuitive and will take quite an investment in time to comprehend, including the in-game dialogue, which makes reference to so many foreign definitions per sentence you will find yourself completely lost in the first hours.Some of the problems include camera rotation (even if turned off) inducing instant motion sickness, unintuitive UI buttons, very hard to click UI buttons, no safe harbours in the open world (constant fear of attack e.g. while configuring your compass), impossible to complete quests early on, frustrating AI (e.g. continuously jumping mechos), frustrating vehicle mechanics, all leading to repetitive behavior and excessive game load/saving. I had hoped a new release would address these shortcomings, but alas.As a last ditch effort I tried to activate some cheats, only to find out these have been removed ""out of principle"" by the game designers in this release.I have to conclude that, even after all these years - and it hurts to say - certain game design choices invoke such frustration for me, I cannot continue to play and would therefore not recommend this game despite its cult following :("

If the last few sentences made any sense to you without playing Vangers beforehand, let me know what you're on and where I can score some."

You are the Vanger - Merchant, Slave, Roadster and sometimes a heartless Killer. (Don't worry, you wont be the killer as often as u play that sneaking oneshot archer in Skyrim ^^)The Story still amazes me, the Characters are well designed and the different Worlds are beautiful.Today...i long for a remake. With more Maps, more Cars, more Weapons and more of all that amazes me since my childhood."
