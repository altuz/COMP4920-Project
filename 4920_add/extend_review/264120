,Not Recommended,264120,12817734,"Posted: 6 November, 2014",all,Blind Side,"Before I begin, I just wanted to share a very important fact. This game was available for free through amazon. When I first found it on amazon, it was a free to play game. that's all well and good, but when I found it for $15 on steam, that got me kind of iffy on the whole thing. it basically told me that they're charging for something they were willing to give out for free. But, I can get past that.What this game does well is customization and gameplay. the controls are solid, the cars feel weighty and there's a fair bit of options available to customize your car right off the bat. all plusses in my book. So, The reason I don't recommend this is because there was no offline modes to be found. every single race was online. on top of that, there really aren't enough people playing to fill a race. personally, I had a hard time finding just one more person so I could actually race. That's because the race won't start if you're by yourself. the only time it does is if you're in hotlap mode. but the thing about that is this: you don't get credit for hotlaps. Nope. no rewards for that. none.All in all, Age of Racing is a story of high potential with all the resources already there. but the game was let down by always online gameplay that's even brought triple-A games to their knees. if they ever add offline, I'll recommend it. but as long as it stays online only, I can't bring myself to do it."

Developers have abandoned this game and left to work on the next one.Victory: The Age of Racingis a racing simulator akin to stuff like Formula 1, but with arcade gameplay controls in the vehicles. I'm much more of an arcade racer (hence my repeated Black Flags when I play anything in here), so Victory does cater to my tastes as well as the average sim fan. The cars are very well modeled, and the tracks are pleasing enough.However, the UI is incredibly overwhelming to me, and it's not intuitive for me to get around at all. I'm sure I haven't even discovered half of the menus because of how much there is to take in. Additionally, the multiplayer is dead and you'd be lucky to find anyone who plays this.Most importantly, as other reviews have pointed out, the developers - Vae Victis Games - have fully abandoned Victory.The game has not been updated in (edit:) over three years, since April 2014.They're working a new game called Racecraft, and they have given free copies of Racecraft to everyone who purchased Victory before they made it free-to-play. Essentially, there's no reason to get Victory as it's superseded by Racecraft (which will not be free).It's up to you if you want to give Victory a try, but it's dead."

,Recommended,264120,9108609,"Posted: 14 February, 2014",all,Ahravi the waff,"I'm going to go ahead and say this from the start, if the thumbs up didn't indicate it already. I highly recommend this game. Granted only for certain people, I understand not everyone likes racing games, especially ones that have some simulation aspects to it. This is more of a simcade, and as people have said about this before, it's easy to get into, hard to master.I do call it how I see it though, even though one of the devs asked for me to review, I have no issue with that, and no, I'm not getting any kind of reward for it nor do I care for one, I just want to see the game succeed and get more players. Starting on developers, they are awesome. I had one personally work with me to troubleshoot an issue I had with the game crashing, and come up with a fix for it, and provided me with a modified .dll file to get the game working until the patch was released the next morning. (this was LATE at night, almost morning when it happened)The game doesn't have many issues for me, but whatever issues it does have are being worked on by the devs atm. They listen to feedback and issues that the community encounters. Like the FPS problems some people are having. I was talking to a dev last night and they have acknowledged the issue and are working to fix it. In that process though they broke cockpit view online, once they quickly found out about that from players, they fixed it the same day. This is what more games need, devs that listen and actually work to change/fix things. I can forgive games that are broken if the devs ACTUALLY TRY. (I'm not saying this game is broken by the way, it is far from it) If you can't at least respect a developer for that, I've got nothing for you.The community of this game, so far, is all friendly. This can of course change, as people are people and the more people that play, the higher chance for bad people to show up, that's just life, don't fault a game for that. There's a MMO like chat ingame, you have a public chat for anyone to talk in, a race chat for a race you're in, and a friends list separate from Steam and a racers tab to show EVERYONE online. You can check out their rank, nationality, and private chat from there. Quite simple and functional.The driving mechanics ingame are quite nice in my opinion. It's definitely not a sim like Assetto Corsa, but it's not super arcadey like Need for Speed games. There's a good balance of fun and realism, combined with the options of automatic gear changing, semi auto, and manual, and various assists you can enable and disable on the fly. The cars all feel nice to drive too, they have good weight to them, you can feel the cars grip (or lack thereof), the cars respond to different surfaces, and changing car setup makes thing vary quite a bit. Running the default setup will work fine but you certainly get an advantage if you take the time to set up your car properly for a certain track, be it the under/oversteer of the car, the suspension stiffness to help cornering, the downforce levels, front/rear brake bias, and even gear ratios, and it does it in a fairly simplified but useful way. Their are descriptions for the settings on the side to help explain, and instead of some settings like camber levels and toe, and ARB settings and spoiler and wing angles, it's simple clicks left and right toward a different setting. I'm a huge fan of racing games in general, arcadey and sim. My main issue with sims is a lot are just plain better when using a racing wheel, which makes me happy to say this works EXTREMELY well with a gamepad. This itself makes it more accessible, which isn't always a bad thing.The amount of content ingame is something I can't comment on too well right now, as I haven't played for that long. The game is only about 500mb though, so keep that in mind. There's a decent amount of tracks from what I've seen, and they're all fun, for me at least. There are preset cars ingame to buy, quite a few for each career and team, and some on the market (using ingame money).But then we get to the car creator. You can choose between the 3 car types, and the different performance groups, then mix and match between different front, middle, and rear pieces of the car, and then change the paint and decals, and choose between a lot of different cosmetics like exhausts, brakes, rims, mudguards, steering wheels, etc. And depending on the car chosen, you get a different amount of PI to spend on your car. These are basically skill points in an MMO, you put points into things like braking, power, grip, etc. And in the same area you can select different engines and tires that will also change the PI settings of your car a bit. This adds a lot of personalization to the game and makes everyones car feel different. So in that aspect, there's a lot of content, and I'm sure there's more to be added.A thing I forgot to put in somewhere about the car types: They're all F1 cars. There are the older ones running V6's if I remember, the Classics. Then you have the Legendary cars, I think these are using V8's ingame, I forget. They are based off more modern looking F1 cars though. Then you have the Formula class, these are using V12's ingame, and are the most modern looking cars.When it comes to graphics, not too much to say. They aren't bad, certainly not the worst. If you really judge a game based on that, well, I don't know what to tell you. The gameplay is very good, the graphics work well and don't detract from the game. Fairly straightforward here. The only thing negative I have to say about that is with the graphics quality, there shouldn't be performance issues, but there are. BUT, like I said earlier, the developers are working on this right now. Like literally now.Regarding peoples butthurtness towards ""in app purchases"". Yes, there are some. You can pay real money to get ingame money from what I understand. But it's optional. There's literally nothing you can get from that, that you can't get ingame by just playing normally, and it DOES NOT make up for lack of skill.Any of these things are subject to change, as this game is still in Early Access and is being worked on still. This was put up on 2-14-2014. If anything changes that makes any of my points irrelevant or outdated, I'll try to remember and edit this.I'll say again, I highly recommend this game for just about every kind of racing fan, and definitely for people that like F1 cars.It's quite accessible too, so not being the best isn't a reason to pass this by."
,Not Recommended,264120,9057638,"Posted: 11 February, 2014",all,Björndolf Höckler,"A few things so far about Victory: The Age of Racing:(This is not an actual review)- The game menu looks quite satisfying and is clearly arranged.- This game is definitely pay to win. Proof? The developers are presenting the ""build your own car"" thing as one of the main features. At the beginning you have already one car of each class so you can start right of racing. so far so good. to build your own car, you need at last (probably with extra parts and stuff a few 100 more) 5200 Gears Credits (the only ingame currency). If you win one of these early multiplayer races (don't know if its getting noticeably more when you progress) you get ~100 GC. So, to build your own the cheapest car of any class, without spending real money, wou have to win like 50 races. Races i've driven were appr. 4 - 6 minutes. In comparison: You can buy one of these predefined cars for the half of the price, which might be even a bit faster. So i think that the real money thing ones again ruins a game by slowing it down horribly, which equals pay to win to me.- Gameplay is (after years of developement of this former-free-to-play game) like Mario Kart without Toads and bananas, but more buggy and erratic. But still quite fun to drive, a bit like trackmania. In conclusion this game is very arcadish, while it is published to have ""realistic car physics"".One of the game developers once said in an interview with insidesimracing on Youtube (2012), that at the beginning, when they startet the title as free-to-play, they thought about not making one of these ptw games. Now the game is still in developement, is ptp and even ptw, too. I kind of regret buying it.At the moment i have, to be honest, no MASSIVE complaint about the game how it is. It's okay, not more or less. But if you make the ""mistake"" to judge this game by what it pretends to be, it's absolutely not enough and seems like a bit of a hoax.At the end i have to put a careful ""YET"", as the developers have time to and possibilities to fix these points, hopefully."

76561197998493782,Recommended,264120,13156825,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,SerratedMobius,"Ive seen alot of reviews stating that this game is ""dead"" because there is simply no one online to race against. While this is true MOST of the time, (just recently raced against 6 other racers in a major event) those leaning on this one flaw in the game are missing out on alot of what Victory has to offer.Victory: The Age of Racing is simply the best racing game I've played on Steam. Hands down. The blistering sense of speed is better than all but one of the many racing games I've experienced, F-Zero GX being the best in that category. The three classes of cars: Legend, Classic, and Formula, each have thier own handling characteristics and quirks, and each reqiring a different skillset to be brought to thier fullest racing potential. Combine that with probably some of the most fun and frustrating original tracks in a racing game (Mario Kart notwithstanding) and you have one hell of a racing experience. That, quite honestly, only gets better with the addition of rival racers. When they're on of course.Car customization is another thing Victory has down. The paint room is very Forza-esque in it's function, but one thing I like about it better than Forza is the fact your graphics don't get warped on curved sections of your car. The decals curve with your cars curves, which makes painting replicas pretty satisfying. Plus the fact you can MAKE YOUR CAR LOOK HOWEVER YOU WANT IT TO. You want a crazy front wing that looks like it wont even work aerodynamically? Slap it on there! You want a two story tall rear wing on that Classic car? Go for it! Dont want wings at all? Who da heck needs downforce!? The styles of car are endless, and it's very interesting to see all the custom cars drivers make. From F1 replicas to ""How is that even working?""Also, well, going back to the point that there arent alot of people playing this game. The few who do, at least the ones that I know, are all really friendly. If you come in and see some one on, dont be afraid to ask questions. From what I know, the community in Victory recognize the lack in number of players and will help any newbie who needs help in anything. I will definitely answer any questions asked to me if im on. As you can see with my hours on record, I'm on quite a bit.So dont let the ""Mixed"" reviews on this game turn you off to it. Ive had so much fun with this game in the near 10 months I've owned it, even made a few really good friends. If you see video games as an investment and not as an opportunity to have some fun, I can't help you there. But if you're looking for a well made racing experience in a fantasy setting, look no further. Come on in, theres a car with your name on it waiting to be driven.No seriously, the cars have your name on them. It's pretty cool.-------------------------P.S. Forgot to mention. It's small, but probably one of the coolest features in this game is the fact that you are still in control of your car after you cross the finish line. Adds a level of immersion I haven't experienced in any racing game I've played before."

Nice twist that gives you the ability to put together your own personal ride, just choose from one of three base classes of car types and then choose front/mid and rear end combos and customise with paints and decals.The driving model has a real pedigree ( based on the Kunos NetKar Pro engine ) and is very rewarding, you have to work with it a bit but then you get good feedback and with that control with the legend cars four wheel drifting and the classics snapping back from oversteer nicely.The tracks are coloutful! with fantasy swooping tracks offering various surfaces adding to the fun and there is promise of procedural tracks adding a huge number of layouts in the future.The racing is online already! with races and live hotlap parties, you earn level up race points, widgets to add boosts to and Gears to spend on improving your current ride.Now it is early access, so there are some minor issues and it is developing, but the Devs are very much active on the forums ( that was a major factor in my purchase ) and the community is small but very encouraging.As I said short review there is more in this game to discover and enjoy,"
,Recommended,264120,9005271,"Posted: 7 February, 2014",all,EmmeHonsho,"Facts: I'm a game moderator (voluntary user); I can be biased, but I know this game really well; also, remember that this is Early Access, so still a beta phase.Talking about the game: first of all, despite the tags, this is NOT a simulator; it's more like an arcade racing game with realistic features (don't expect to drift on every corner or have random racing lines); still, the model is really satisfying: the racing experience and setup know-how is rewarded, while beginners won't have many problems driving their first cars. With the inclusions of new events, career mode and other stuff there's plenty to do, and car customization is one of the best ever seen in a racing game, both on visual stuff like paint and development. Good races are real fun, and the tracks are inspired and good to drive in. The devs also are very active, and try to fix bugs in a quickly way (also are active in the forums, which is nice).Bad things: excluding random bugs (which I'm not experiencing at the moment, save for some really minor stuff) the worst part is the performance of the game in this phase. We know that graphic optimization and new shaders are coming very soon, but at the moment on many computers a race with full roster will make the fps drop. There's also the minor issue of a little population, but hopefully this will change in the next weeks (it's still early - early access), and the races and events still flow very nicely, so it's not really a problem.What will come next: full Steam integration, procedural race tracks, track editor and Steam Workshop support. Probably some of the best features to have in a game like this.For old users: the payment model has changed. This is now a buy-to-play; so you will need to buy the game if you want to play (it's not going free to play after the beta) but THERE ARE NO MORE MICROTRANSACTIONS in the game. Also, the reward were raised quite a lot, so buying new cars is much faster.Conclusions: in my opinion, if you like racing games, you are curious or look for a relaxed fun game go for it. There's plenty to do, the game has some good depth, the class are really different one from each other and at this low price it's worth the entry, also because new features will flow in and make the game even better. Still, if you like only Simulators, beware that this game is not one; don't expect an Assetto Corsa or rFactor or iRacing here, because it's not (and it does not pretend to be one)."

The driving physics model feels fun, I'm not a super good driver but I can do ok without any assists on and it just feels enjoyable. Force feedback on a G27 wheel feels better than in many expensive games by big studios. The developers listen to the players and the game has already gotten better in the few days I've played it when they changed the amount of gear credits you get from good lap times. I only wish it will get many more players in the future. I've tried to get my friends to play it but many seem to be put off by the arcadey look which I don't mind at all even if I prefer realistic simulation games, as the car's handling is just so fun in this.

This game seems like a hybrid...very customizable, but you don't have to count every tooth on every gear in your car. Yet, every change I make to my car, no matter how small, affects it's performance. I like that.With all the control options, I must say that Victory is the most accessable/intuitive racing game I have ever played and the community is extremely helpful towards new players. My steering wheel I use (MS Sidewinder FF Wheel)* can be adjusted in game. I would recommend enabling ""Reverse force feedback"" for those having issues with the ""feel"" of your wheel. Worked for me. Graphics are good. The scenery isn't as alive as some racing games. I haven't seen huge crowds or sponsors I recognize. You'll forget about that the moment a race starts.The Sound, to me, is spectacular! I can hear the audible whine of gears straining in the transmission as the engine approaches 12000rpm. I can hear the realistic ""WHOOSH!"" of the wind getting louder and louder as I pass 200mph! THAT CORNER IS COMING UP FAST!      WHAM!You will learn every day that you are getting a bit faster with each lap. You'll find yourself starting a server of your own and inviting people to your race.

The sense of speed while driving in Victory and the excitement of racing others online...and losing to them...again and again...can be matched only when you win your first race! AWESOME!I've played a lot of mostly EA(tm)'s Formula and NASCAR(R) series and appreciate the vast mechanical customization available in these games. I would spend hours and hours fine tuning and customizing my car. The pre-race practice, tuning again, qualifying and racing on actual real-world tracks was awesome! (Customization on the car bodies used to be great. Over time, I've noticed that I'm having to buy ""custom cars"" as DLC....hmmm.) Anyway....Then I got a job. And a relationship. Then the military.

What a bummer!Victory: The Age of Racing has enabled me to use a system of simple* sliders to adjust each of the major mechanical  groups on my car....gears, suspension, downforce, brakes, etc. I am up and on the track in moments. And, yes, the in-game customization is, in my view, the best in the biz. Check out some user made cars online. Yep, most are created by ppl like you and me. A very, very intuitive system with too many combination to go into. I love the customization in Victory. The only thing that beats it WAS early NASCAR(R) Sims where I could practically create a car skin with my face on it! As I mentioned earlier, it seems I gotta buy many cars from EA(tm), now.PLEASE, I have never spent any more $$$ than the original purchase price on this game! As far as I know, and I'm approaching 700 hours of game time, all purchases through ""gear credits"".  ""Gear credits"" are awarded by driving hotlaps for the best time, or racing humans from around the world. Believe me, there are good drivers out there! Few are playing at this time, that's what I'm seeing.I believe there is an anticipation in the community of major news. The standard events are down, but I can create a server and people who are in ""stealth mode"", where players can  choose to appear offline to do personal stuff (creating cars, practicing, etc) suddenly join my race. It appears many times that the servers are dead. Only a very few times have I put out the ""bait"" and sat there on my track and no one joins. Some people don't want to be interrupted while they are perfecting their car. Sometimes I am busy and don't necessarily want to race....I'm in the middle of finishing my next Formula Car!BTW: Races are restricted to cars of the same point class. The amount of points you put into your car will have a great influence on it's performance. These 0-60/70 points are put into YOUR OWN CAR, CREATED BY YOU. The points are allocated to your own preference. You can customize aerodynamics, downforce, braking, grip, etc and,  more importantly, EVERY car is different, in my opinion. AND I CANT, NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY, FIND ANYTHING REMOTELY ""PAY-TO-WIN"" HERE! BELIEVE ME, I'M A HUGE FAN OF PAY-TO-WIN AND VICTORY IS NO ""PAY-TO-WIN""!Victory: Age of Racing will make your hair stand on end.If you think you're not getting anything out of it, like me...losing a lot more than winning, ask someone in game to give you some advice on a generic set up for your car. You will be amazed at the level of control you'll gain when you understand what the points and sliders do to your car."

It liiks like a racing simulator but it is far from the simulator feel making racing alot more enjoyable. the graphics look good and runs smoothly. The costomization is simple to learn and works rather well. The courses are very well constructed and they all have somthing different in them. The car stat costomization is excellent letting you choose how you want your car to drive and how well it can drive. Somtimes its hard to get into a race with somone else when not much people are playing, but there is a hotlap mode where you race arround a track and get in game currency (gears) every time you complete a lap with out crashing or beating your best time. I would love to see more people play this game and grow the allready awesome community."

As a wheel user I think Vae Victis has done a good job to create a Universal Generic Controller Profile setup that has good ffb recognizes my ClubSport Wheel and ClubSport pedals and maps with ease and recognizes my ClubSport Shifter as a secondary input device then allows for axis sensitivity adjustments. If your familar with what is considered an Arcade Racing game you know wheel support is hit or miss with most any title. The fact Vae Victis has it right for the most part goes a long way torward my overall outlook of the game and it's developer.Vae Victis is worth keeping around and their efforts deserve our support!

Anything other than a controller is not really worth it... even a wheel.  The wheel support just doesn't feel right but it is an arcade game so the controller is just fine and sometimes more ""fun"" this way anyways.  Some confusing UI is about the worste part.  Not much multiplayer and not many people playing but for a fun start to racing it's really not that bad.  Not great though."

The graphics is from early 2000, physics is from those times as well -- given that the game is posed as a semi-serious simulator! The car constructor limits you to 2-3 details of each kind -- and building a car is really expensive. You would need to hang out in the empty lobby for a long-long time until you can afford one. The scoring system is somewhat mysterious, rewarding ""participation, not victory"". Also, English translation is weird sometimes.On the positive side, the game does not crash, supports side controllers like steering wheels (although the settings menu is poor as a gradstudent -- no way to adjust sensitivity, deadzones, linearity or whatever) and has something like 15 tracks in 3 environments, which is the most abundant element of the game so far.In the end, the idea is worth the praise, but the implementation pretty much sucks. No noticeable improvements occured over the past three months. If you want to race somewhere similar, I would advise Trackmania Nations or F1 2013."

Victory, in its current state, is nothing short of an underwhelming experience that left me wanting what was promised from the current release.- Car editing is, to be honest, boring. While the livery editor is decent (if not a little fiddly), the amount of selectable blocks is low and there's no visual customisation outside of that. Customisation of the car's stats is easy but you have to pay a virtual currency to make any changes - eliminating any aspect of trial-and-error.- Online racing is just awful. With six players maximum on the track and a lobby system that is a completely confusing mess, actually getting into a game is hard enough. Getting into a competitive one with players you can actually *race* against players instead of lapping or being lapped is even harder due to big imbalances.- While the game isn't free to play, you can tell that it used to be at one point. You can use your gears to purchase boosts to your cars for single races (which is hugely unfair) and doing anything related to new cars costs some. For a game that advertises the freedom you get in modifying cars, you sure are locked out of doing many free things. Even modifying stats costs gears - it just goes too far.This game has potential, but it's hugely untapped potential, and while the driving model is pretty cool and the upcoming track editor seems promising, in its current state I am not impressed."

Once you complete the license test (aka clicking on license) you are let loose  on your wonderful turd racing career. There are only usually about 3 other turd racers online at a time, all driving their turd mobiles. Once you get into a race your turd mobile spins its turd tires, gets traction, and then hits the turd guardrail. This is 100 percent honest to go one of the worst racing experiences I have ever had.

However, unless you are perfectly fine with having the game destroyed at some unannounced point, and all your progress gone with it, I wouldn't dedicate too much time to it…... Honestly, I'm surprised they brought the servers back up after their 'issues'...I love the game to death, but it's completely based around the fact that there is a community behind it... Which there isn't...In a brief summary, sadly to say, i don't recommend this game, or their new game, Racecraft, or any other game this developer comes out with, because, after all this time, all we are given is a crappy tach demo of a system that i would argue is borderline worthless in this style of racing game, and the announcement that the game we paid for, stood behind, and supported for so long while being left in the dark, is going free 2 play and has, essentially, already been taken out back and shot."
