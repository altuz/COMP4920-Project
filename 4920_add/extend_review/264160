Is this game for you?Do you like permadeath?Do you like a high difficulty level.Do you like to find out how items and weapons work and how to make them work in your favor?Do you like to find out how each mob reacts differently and change tactis in order to beat them?Do you like strategic and tactical gameplay?Do you like turn-based combat? (Actually it is both: turn-based or action; as you like)You will find all of this.You will also find different characters and many items to loot from.I was even able to contact the creator of this game and we shared a few Emails.I can highly recommend this game. Not only will it take you a while to beat, it also has a very high replayvalue, as the dungeons, mobs and items are generated randomly for each playtrhough."

I picked it up in a recent weekly sale on a whim, and I'm glad I did.I find there is something charming about the graphics, it reminds me of 90's prerendered 3D sprites or something, and has some cute item physics and corpse ragdoll.Sound effects are adequate, although the small amount of music quickly led me to turning it off.The mobile version is also surprisingly good and controls well, and you can play the first few levels for free if you insist on trying it before you buy.But the most important thing is the gameplay, randomisation and discovery, and that's where it shines as a true rogue-like. At first you have no idea how to deal with all the different items, but with each run you learn a bit more, and discover a little more of the hidden attributes, details and interactions. Sometimes I find this kind of hidden information frustrating, but so far in WazHack the discovery and new possibilities you learn has been really fun.I'm informed that WazHack takes a lot of inspiration from NetHack, and while I've played various rogue-likes, and a lot of Angband (which I finally beat recently), I never really played NetHack. I like WazHack enough that I'm thinking I probably should have played NetHack more, but for now I expect to enjoy a lot more hours in WazHack."

It feels like most development energy went into the engine, custom graphics, and classes/skills. There's also some well aged cheese around, for those who make the appropriate temporal sacrifice.If you strongly identify with the @ character on your keyboard, stick with nethack. If you need to be graphicsed at for immersion, get a modern ""roguelike"" rather than a real rogue variant like this one.Pros: Classic feel. Skills / talents are interesting. Classes are pretty well-balanced. Blends in some modern mechanics, while keeping to the genre. Good cheese. No spoon-feeding.Cons: Could use more content. It isn't as rich in items and monsters as many rogue variants (nethack, angband, moria, and tome), or as other modern ""roguelikes"" that don't stick to the classic formula. Unique monsters would be nice."

A 2d homage to nethack, turn based but with fluid enough controls that you might forget it's turnbased. Which will obviously result in your death.As far as I know, this is not one of the roguelikes where you have persistant unlocks, the only thing you gain between one run to the next is knowledge (and some achievement type stuff).I find wazhack to be very addictive and extremely uncompromising. This is a proper roguelike with 2d graphics and a decently clean and simple UI. Like all faithful roguelikes, time invested is not necessarily related to success. You might never beat this game ever, or you might beat it on your first run.The controls and straightforward interface makes this very accessible, this is an excellent representation of the genre that can and will challenge long-time enthusiasts, but can also be easily picked up by somebody who is new to this type of game."

Make no mistake though getting said amulets will require hours and hours of effort into learning strategies/game mechanics so you can increase your odds of survival.The RNG isn`t unfair in this game, that said in some runs you may get ultimate items on the first floor or in another room more than half of the stuff you pick up is cursed(cursed means the item will probably do something you hate like for instance if it is an equipment it will be glue to you, if it is a potion the effect will be diminished) BUT make no mistake a good player is capable of prevailing against odds if he knows what he is doing.There are tons of classes each with a diferent playstyle, you have wizards,rogues,archers,knights and the variants like barbarian(a big warrior that has issues to wear armor due to his big size).about equipments, it is possible to equip 2 rings,1 cape,boots,gloves,armor and a helmet(just like any rpg you ever played)now for some PROS and CONSPros-Huge replayability(look my playtime)-Interesting game mechanics(won`t spoil much find about it yourselves)-Randomized dungeon/items assures you no playtrought will be the same-Has Online coop-You can save during the gameCons-Huge difficulty(your first tries will always be failures, unless you know what you are doing the game can be pretty unfair at times)-There are no diferent difficulties to the game(in other words you can`t choose between easy,medium,hard, the game has only 1 difficulty setting)Neutral-It is a roguelike so every run you only get one life-The only thing you carry over trought playtroughs is your intelligence(in other words you should learn from your mistakes and always strive to go deeper)With all that said, i truly enjoyed wazhack, and i had a blast playing it with a friend it is only one of the few games in my library that i have invested soo much time, for an indie game developed by just one guy i truly i got way more than my moneys worth.If you are a fan of roguelikes buy this, if you are a fan of rpgs buy this, but if the idea of permadeath turns you off you should play stay away from this game"

Rogue-like perma-death I understand and expected.   But this is a game where the designers exercise arbitrary control over every choice you can make, and it isn't the better for their choices.The mechanics and the attack/spell visuals for all the different ""classes"" are the same.  Their starting stats are pretty much all the same.   And limited by the game -why?  If I want to play a wizard with Intelligence 13 and Strength 15, or a barbarian with constitution 9 and wisdom 16 - why stop me?  The character may die faster, but that's my choice.  And it might make starting a new character every 15 minutes a bit more interesting.  Or at least give the illusion of player control.But when my pet dies from MY attacks (because I have no control over it and it won't attack but also won't move away?)  I get tired of that pretty quickly.   When you pass a side door the game asks ""Investigate Yes/No?"" but your answer doesn't matter- either way the monsters come out. In large numbers.  Behind you.   Right on top of your pet, if they're still alive.  (Yeah, every time over at least 20 rounds ofplay...wth?)When one of my characters dies because a merchant insists I pay for damages from a dwarf attacking ME - and I sell them everything I'd collected, then try to run - and go through every healing I have, a speed potion, all of my attacks,  and even lead the merchant through a trap (which zaps me but doesn't affect the merchant).   And perhaps I wouldn't really mind that if at least it was my character who had broken the merchant's goods!Was it exciting for two minutes? Yes.   Did I make me want to try again?  No.   That's where this game falls on it's face.I don't expect a game to be fair, and games can be arbitrary - up to a point.  But if you want my time there has to be something about it that's rewarding to me.   If there is nothing under my control as the player that can change the presentation of the game, the mechanics, or the outcome then why give you my time?Torchlight on insta-death mode offers much greater variety of classes, skills, creatures, customizations, mods and settings."

The game takes a lot of the basic features of NetHack such as cursed/uncursed/blessed items, spells that are forgotten over time, and the ability to make an army of pets to fight to the death for you and adds to them or changes them in ways that make it a fresh experience. Giving too many details would ruin the fun of discovering the game's secrets butpets that have died don't have to stay dead!While I was initially disappointed that certain features from NetHack weren't in this game such as digging through walls or bones levels; I find that once I get started on a character I don't even think to compare the games: I am too busy enjoying this one.Overall: 10/10 would lose entourage to green dragon at depth ~1400 again."

76561197980250426,Recommended,264160,9808420,"Posted: 13 April, 2014",all,AnErectionLasting4HrsOrMore,"I've been playing Wazhack for about 8 months and it has really become one of my favorite games of all time. I was fairly new to rogue-likes at the time- I had only really delved into the survival genre (UnReal World and Cataclysm: DDA) after becoming perma-death obsessed through playing Don't Starve and FTL, but I had stayed away from hardcore dungeon crawlers and *hack games. I've since played nethack and other dungeon rogue-likes, but I just keep coming back to Waz. It's so simple to play compared to other rogue-likes in this genre because of the more tangible graphics and absence of the constant need to input keyboard commands.Don't let the user-friendly design and graphics put you off if you are a true rogue-like fan, as this is not a ""rogue-lite"" at all, but a full-on hardcore adventure complete with emergent gameplay and those grand educational experiences (death, death, and more death) that you expect from these games. Your have the same overall controls over your character that you do in nethack, all items are unidentified, scroll names are obfuscated (again, just like nethack), and like half of the items are cursed.It might not have some of the features of nethack (religion is absent, at least in the form it has in nethack, and there aren't as many classes) but I wouldn't be surprised if the dev worked that stuff in eventually as it seems development is ongoing. It used to be a good bit easier than nethack (actually got the amulet once but died soon after...didn't ascend) but it appears the dev has ramped up the difficulty in more recent updates and I'm having trouble consistently getting characters to 600 ft.Some people criticize the graphic style but I don't mind it and actually find it amusing. Same goes for sound but it does its job. rogue-likes have never been known for graphics and sound anyway.If you don't know anything about rogue-likes, this would be a great place to start as it's a ""real"" rogue-like in a user friendly package that gives you easy acces to the ""core experience"" of this genre."
,Not Recommended,264160,13917327,"Posted: 9 January, 2015",all,Aurumlamina,"An interesting little permadeath rogue-like game, it seemed promising at first.  There are over a dozen classes to choose from, each with a skill tree with unique (or at least varied) skills to level up to improve your chosen character.  Along the way I'd run into leprechauns and psychadelic fountains that caused the entirety of my game to look like I was tripping on acid while I did battle with floating shapes and swirling colors.Unfortunately, the game quickly gets old.  In reality, the characters don't -feel- much different from one another once you're in the dungeon.  Unlike other rogue-likes, where you will die and go, ""Oh man!  I should've done <enter alternative course of action here>"" and give the game another go, I felt frustrated more than anything with this particular game.  It seemed like all too often my death was unrelated to anything done on my part and more of a roll of the die that resulted in an overpowered monster showing up or a weapon that was cursed that I never had the opportunity to uncurse on that particular run.In the end, the game isn't -bad- persay.  I might even install it and give it another go in the future when I'm feeling bored.  I don't recommend this game, however, because there are far better rogue-likes out there to play that are more fun and have a much longer longevity to them.  If you do decide to pick this up, get it when it's on sale!"

76561198017013327,Recommended,264160,21376584,"Posted: 21 February, 2016",all,Mustmayostardayonnaise,"Highly recommended with one caveat:Be prepared to die. A lot.That you'll (very, very) often die in unexpected and hilarious ways may or may not make the game more attractive to you.The game is, in essence, Nethack with a slightly fancier graphic interface. Don't be fooled by this into thinking you're playing anything but a turn-based game, however. If you stop, the action stops. As the tagline says you have ""all the time in the world"" and that's true as far as it goes. You're free to walk away from the PC for an hour while an angry Dwarf Lord is staring you in the face, axe poised to cleave your skull in two, and rest assured that he'll still be there when you return, just as short and belligerent as he was when you left.The classes you have to choose from run from the rather humdrum Knight to the ever-faithful Wizard to a singing Bardess, each of whom is endowed with the sort of standard STR, CHA, DEX etc. attributes common to most dungeon-themed games. The starting attributes can be tweaked, to an extent, but each character has certain minimums/maximums in each category that cannot be exceeded. Likewise your alignment can be changed, but again only to an extent. Not all characters can be played as ""Chaotic Evil"", for instance.The game itself is set up as a simple dungeon, into which depths you must descend in increments of 100 feet, with 3 floors per ""level"". Enemies will scale both according to level depth, and according to your character's current attributes and abilities. The strong you get, and the deeper you go, the tougher enemies you can expect to encounter. The entire dungeon consists of 3000 feet, i.e. 90 floors to explore, at the bottom of which you'll encounter one of several varieties of the game's main Boss.To help you get there you'll have an inventory in which you can store a limited amount of items and equipment such as spells, potions, armor, weapons, food and magical items. How much you can carry is determined by your CON attribute, and as this varies from character to character you'll find that different characters require different strategies in terms of what you'll decide to hold onto and what you'll have to discard. Your Barbarian or Vandal may be able to hold on to an astounding number of items, but your White Witch will find herself quickly over-encumbered and see her attack speed and movement speed reduced as a result. Choose wisely, in other words, both your character and their possessions.The inventory is/can be quite large, but since you're playing a turn-based game there's nothing stopping you from taking what time you need to sort through it. By default the game allows you to sort items by weight at the click of a button, or to sort by category such as ""tools"" etc., in the same way. There are also items to be found in-game that can give you the ability to sort by ""value"" or the like, but access to these isn't guaranteed.Combat is performed by either magical or physical means. You have the standard health and mana meters, which will scale both according to your character's level and are also dependent on a few other factors such as potions/drinks or various things and places you can interact with as you progress. Spellbooks abound, as do various wands, all flavored toward ""evil"" or ""good"" uses, as well as ""dark"" and ""light"" magic. Your ability to use these and the strength of the corresponding effect are seperate attributes that are improved with use, and they are mutually exclusive of one another, meaning if you increase your ability to perform ""light"" magic you will lessen the maximum possible ability that you could obtain in ""dark"" magic, or vice versa.Weapons range from the humble staff to the mighty Excalibur to your bare fists, if you're so inclined. Weapon proficiencies, like those of spellcasting, are increased as you use a given weapon category such as Bows or Two-Handed swords or staves and so on. Some enemies are more susceptible to magical attacks than physical, while some operate on the reverse principle. Knowing what to use against a given enemy comes through trial and error, and in this game ""error"" means a quick and not necessarily painless death.There are various NPCs spread throughout the dungeon, though their number, the cost of their services, and their attitude toward you and your quest are all  dependent, at least in part, on your particular character's CHA skill. A higher CHA means more NPCs, so again some characters can expect to be able to take advantage of more variety of services than others.The game also includes two ""side areas"" in every dungeon. Their location is somewhat randomized, but there is always a Gnomish Mine to the left and a Roman Fort to the right. When or if you decide to go in them is entirely optional, although the Mines provide some very useful resources for the late game. The Roman Fort is often avoided entirely, as most players consider it to be far more difficult to complete then the base game, and I tend to agree. I only enter the fort *after* I've completed the full 3000 foot base challenge, and only then if I'm feeling very powerful and am prepared to die in a hail of arrows if I make a single mistake.The game is difficult, to be sure. Many say exceedingly so, and the word ""impossible"" comes up rather often in conversations dealing with the game. If perma-death isn't your thing you should probably avoid this at all costs, but if you're prepared for a challenging environment, a large variety of enemies, and a moderately healthy dose of RNG, you could do a lot worse than Wazhack. Personally I enjoy the hell out of it, deaths at 100 feet from club-wielding Kobolds notwithstanding. My first success didn't come until I'd clocked 100 hours in the game, but by then I was well hooked and a taste of victory only prompted me to try again with a new class, and a new strategy.If you do try it, above all keep in mind that despite the graphical interface this is 100% a turn-based game. Don't get suckered into thinking you have to rush anything. When you encounter difficulty stop, look through your inventory and give some thought to what item or scroll or potion or wand, etc, will offer you the best chance at coming out of the fight alive. Sometimes you won't discover anything that will work for certain, and you'll be reduced to quaffing a random, unidentified potion in the hopes that it will heal you, or zapping the enemy with an unidentified wand in the hopes that he'll just die already, but other times you'll realize that the key to survival is right there in your pocket, and then you can congratulate yourself and move on, probably right  into the face of an even worse enemy.Enjoy!"

I've been recently playing nethack on vulture before i found this and what a great surprise! Combining the easy feel of platform games with the rougue like gaming on seemingly endless map scenarios. My favorite thing is how they have kept to the title name with the naming system. I was hoping for some prayers because they help you out of some sticky situations in the original game and the lack of the pickaxe for crushing walls is to bad but other then that its true to the original with so many classes to choose from and random levels, it offers great replayabilty which is somthing I often look for in a game.So overall I would have to say that it a good 9 out of 10 for me."

,Recommended,264160,9271993,"Posted: 26 February, 2014",all,Silva,"WazHack, as a rogue-like, has a great deal of luck involved. That is the nature of the genre--a careful balancing act between the influence of luck and of skill. Initially, after some ""unfair"" deaths, you will think the game is all about luck. This is an illusion. WazHack does involve quite a bit of skill, but in ways that are not apparent until you have braved the depths repeatedly. You will die, often. You will make mistakes. But unlike a lot of games, growing from those mistakes is not an automatic, subconscious affair. As the great yoshimitsu once said, ""overconfidence is the greatest enemy"".How then, do you reveal the skills involved in WazHack?Easy. You think. Every item carries a risk, and managing those risks is something learned by practice... By glorious, stupid deaths from a wager failed. Do you try on every piece of equipment you find? Bad move. You just equipped a cursed -3 helm, sucker. Good luck getting that off. Do you equip every amulet or ring you find? Sorry, that was enchanted with polymorph. You are now a rat. It seems random, and to an extent it is. But through play, patterns emerge. Starter pets growl at cursed items as they approach. Traps on the ground could burn, inflict sleep, teleport... Why not jump over? Hm, there's a door here... If I open it, enemies spawn. But if I defeat them all and check once more, I am rewarded.So yes, WazHack is a game of chance. Every rogue-like is, to varying degrees. But it is also a game of skill. Don't forget it."

Unidentified potions, scrolls, random magic items, monsters, one keypress is a turn, ect.This is pretty standard, neither as expansive as ADoM or (Z)Angband, with all the races, caves, world, item permutations, monsters and so forth that those games have. Compared to many other 90s and later roguelikes, its pretty simple.8 classes, each with a male and female type and a pet (the pet is not pickable - each class has their pet). Male and female types are slightly different and have slightly different skills and starting inventory. Stats are customizable by clicking on the stat box, and so is alignment( which I havent found a use for, yet)So really, 16 classes if you wanted to nit pick.They are Sorcerer/Sorceress - a monster summoner and ""dark magic"" type, Wizard/White Witch - a typical spell caster, Knight/Valkyrie- your standard ""warrior in shining armor"" although the Valkyrie starts with crap armor, Rogue/Thief - Stealthy and thiefly class, Hunter/Huntress - Ranged weapon fighter, Barbarian/Vandal - Huge and strong but no or very little armor, Bard/Bardess (Bardess!?) - plays magic musical instruments, and Druid/Druidess - nature magician.Theres a nice balance of classes, although I do wish the pet was choosable, or more exotic. I want my Huntress to have a cat! The Thief's monkey is cool and unique.Other than that, theres just the procedurally created dungeon, no towns, quests or NPCs besides a shopkeeper of Arabian Nights extraction that can be found randomly in the dungeon. The items are what youd expect from a traditional roguelike, althpough there are some pretty cool effects and things you can find. The sounds are just the grunts, thwacks and clangs youd expect from a swordfighting game and theres no music.So what makes this game cool?Two things. One, unlike most traditional style roguelikes, its not top down but sidescrolling. And 2. No tiles or ASCII - Its graphical with decently rendered graphics for an indie game. Pick up a plaid cape, and put it on, and your PC is wearing it. A ""smoking potion"" is rendered smoking, fire burns, traps explode, arrows shoot ect. Although there are other graphical roguelikes out there, I personally have never seen a traditional one done like this. Step on a potion, it topples over, throw a dagger and it clangs and slides on the ground before stopping. Also, it is still turn based. When youre not moving, the mosters dont move. It gives it this weird red light, green light (that old children's game) effect that I personally like.Al in all, its a cool game. I still think the asking price is a bit high at $9.99 for what you get (After all, there are much more complex roguelikes out there for FREE). But I dont mind paying for it, the rendering is nice. And way better than squinting at ""@""s and ""k""s. If youre a die hard traditional roguelike fan, pick it up, especially if you can find it for 10% or better off!EDIT: Really weird. I alt-tabbed back to the game, and theres music? There hasnt been any music before this time (and yes, I had the sound on). It just suddenly appeared. So as for the music, its decent. I turned it off though because I was so used to playing that I found it destracting."

Warrior class may seem awesome at first but it's melee dosesnt work later in game unless you get adequate range power. Alot of things gotta be in equilibrium, otherwise youre gonna have a bad time. For an example: My Wizard may be great ranged and magic but I always have a pretty powerful melee for backup later game. Its all about prepping for later game (lvl6+) you would rather die repeadtly around lvl4 bc you can pretty much feel at that point if youre gonna be prepped. Oh, you have a powerful ledgendary weapon? you wont get far without good spells or wands. This game is good and overwhelmingly well executed, although newbies and people with less than 100 hours may be able to pass 300ft easily without fustration, they may not find mid-lower levels easy and fun, but rather awful because of an almost garunteed death.Armor and weapons isn't everything, but they sure do help.Ok fine. It sucks to try get into. But it will be one of the best games in your eyes if you try and have that determination to try reach the dragon boss and smack the crap out of him.Yes, fine. The graphics are horrendous. but no one complained when anahack or net hack came out in the 80's. People still play the @ symbol and the game itself today.The shopkeeper looks invincible? gues what? hes not.Beast mastery at 100 percent and multiple create monsters will result in a wonderful turban and robe for you to wear that can last you till the boss.You should be able to spare the pain of dying later (if you want to) if you feel youre character isn't well equpped enough at 300 to 400 ft.Look at run throughs on youtube people. They know what they're doing."

,Recommended,264160,25562365,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,BossGalaga,"Wazhack is a traditional roguelike (very Nethack-ish) reimagined as a 2D platformer/side-scroller.The controls and the UI are streamlined, simplified and easy to use, even for people who may be new to the roguelike/dungeon crawling genre. No hotkeys to memorize or confusing menus. The graphics while simple, have their own unique charm. The music/sound is not particularly noteworthy but works well. The sound also serves to provide the player with audio cues.The gameplay is a rehash of the classic ""get to the Xth floor, get the thing"" formula but instead of the classic top-down plays more like a side-scrolling platformer. A warning...it's not a platformer. It's a turn-based game.If you play this game like Mario Bros./Sonic (which you can) you will die more often than you would otherwise. In fact, you have about a 50/50 chance of killing yourself. There are many times when it is wise to stop, evaluate your surroundings, inventory and enemies before making your next move.Verdict: This game is +1 fun!Check out this greatgame guide(for Knights) if you don't mind some ""spoilers.""If you would rather avoid spoilers, check out thisbeginner's guideinstead."

What does that mean?-You can only save the game for the sole purpose of stopping now and continuing later. You can't load a save if things go south.-If your character dies, it stays dead. Your only option is to start over.-The dungeons are built randomly. Each run is subtly different.-The game isreally bloody hard. You will die. A lot. A whole lot.-The game doesn't hold your hand at all. It won't ask questions if you tell it you want to cast fireball where you're standing. It'll let you, and then it'll kill you with your own fireball.For better or worse, WazHack makes no effort to disguise the fact that it takes heavy inspiration from NetHack, the roguelike that put roguelikes on the map (if Rogue itself didn't, anyway). A lot of mechanics are shared between the two, so Nethack players should feel mostly at home.That said, there are subtle differences as well, which NetHack veterans will pick up on and perhaps promptly get killed by. If you're one of the elite few that actuallybeatNetHack, and yearn for the days when you didn't know every single trick in the game, definitely give WazHack a try."

If you end up with lazy survival items arriving at 500 ft below or you find huge doors/holes in the wall on your only path down, consider yourself dead already. Especially spellcasters rely heavily on finding usefull spells which they usually don't most of the time.- Most offensive spells are hugely underpowered at higher skill & experience levels.- Initial survival - especially non-melee characters - hugely depends on their pets- A huge amount of unfairness: Sometimes monsters sense when you arrive by ladder/portal/teleport at a floor level and all home in on you - even bursting thru doors - for the kill attacking you from all sides, as if the program rolled your immediate execution/death.- Hungry? You sometimes kill mountains worth of food without finding food !- Your heroes who survived and won the game are not saved anywhere & cannot be played with again. They are just reduced to an entry in the Guildhall of Fame. New Game is your only option.Conclusion? +200 hours, 3 survived - a knight, a valkyrie & a wizard - and a myriad others died.The huge amount of deaths, randomness & required luck to keep your characters alive can very discouraging for most gamers and only harcore or some persistent gamers will give this a further try and at the end can get rewarded with a huge - but brief - feeling of accomplishment.Brief because you next tries will end up again in countless deaths and you get the feeling it was all just 100% luck. Not your skill, not your intelligence, not your resourcefulness. . . just luck.This game is a 50/50 deal.

I keep dying a lot quicker than in Dungeons of Dredmor, which saves a lot of time.First game, found a README scroll, laughed about the name of it, tried it out, turned out to be a summon monster scroll. Got surrounded by 14 monsters at level 1, died in one turn.Third game, found a +5 longbow and +3 arrows, felt like an unbeatable archery god, accidentally hit the shop keeper  while shooting some rats, ignored the whining of the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag merchant for one turn too long.

It would have been far better with A) more content, B) unique monsters, C) different names for the scrolls (and maybe a second identifier on potions) since they're lifted right out of Nethack, and D) MORE CONTENT.I do like the side ""rooms"" you can ""investigate"" for monster waves. Maybe I am passing judgement way too soon since I've only made it about 300 feet in. What wikis I found didn't seem populated with content, making things seem sparse.Had this been a ""standard"" dungeon crawl game and not such an obvious overglorified nod to Nethack (right down to water nymphs and fountains), I'd probably enjoy it more. But it's a fun little diversion, so I'll keep playing. The amount of effort going into this to get the right feel shows, so that is worth something. And a 3D roguelike never hurts, it is a nice change from the pixel art of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and others.$10 is... a bit steep.

I saw it was on steam greenlight a few months later, and thumbed it up. A year later it made its silent realease on steam. I was happy it was on steam, yet for some odd reason didn't buy it. A year later, I bought the game at last. I had almost known this game for 3 years, and I haden't even played it! It was time to sink my teeth into the huge world of WazHackThis is a roguelike dungeon crawler. It's like most dungeon crawler games, but one quirk makes it diffrent from the rest. ""All the time in the world"". This means that when you move, so does the world, and when you stop, so does the world. This means that you can take your time in combat, and situations, and I love that. The fact that I have time to contemplate my next move, is really cool. And let me tell you, you NEED to think about your 'next move', because this game has perma-death.This game has many diffrent characters to play as, each giving its own unique since of play style. You could be a knight, that uses melee weapons, and is a tank. Or, you could be a fragile wizard, that attacks from a range, and hits with staffs.This will give you a lot of reason to replay the game, even after you've beaten it.This game will make you question everything about the enviroment around you. You have to question every item you pick up, and every piece of food you pick up. Why? The walls could have hidden spike traps, that amulet could strangle you to death, and that apple could be poisoned. Everything has a fair chance of being dangerous, so you must be cautious.One time, I decided to use a scroll, and guess what it did? It destoryed my armor, and I died shortly after. You have to make sure what you wear, or even look at, is safe, and I love it.This game has such a large variety of items to find, and discover. Maybe you'll find a lute that puts even the fiercest of beasts to sleep. Maybe you'll find a gem, that turns out to actually be a worthless piece of glass! Maybe you'll find a sword that allows you to levitate, and shoot magic missles! It's you're job to find the right items that will help you, and the items that will destroy you! You have to paly the game for quite a while to even get an idea of what each item does. Unless you google it. Then you've taken all the fun out it it. Good job.This game has an RPG-like system. Everytime you level up, you get to upgrade a skill (each skill is unique to every character). Perhaps you want to upgrade your duel wielding skills. Or maybe you would rather upgrade your first aid skill, so you don't die as fast. The choice is up to you.They are currently updating the game every so often with a bunch of new content, so there will always be something new waiting for you!CONCLUSION: This is an underated gem on steam, and I recomend it to everyone who has 10 $ to spare. And make sure you have some free time as well, because you are gonna get lost in this game. You will lose track of time. I started the game up at 1pm, and the next thing I know its 2 in the morning"

You could even make the game harder as it all ready is. I had loved this, RPG's have always fascinated me. You leveled up in a skill gorup of the weapon you had used through out the game. You leveled your spell base on the spells you used. (Dark, Life). Basically you leveled things in the game by what you use. You could choose your own perks though.It's completely free choice. You can attack merchants to gain their whole inventory! (Beware, low levels will most likely get 2 shotted.) It's extremely balanced, you control on what you do. Food is extremely important. Always have food in your inventory when exploring.

The creater of the game is apparently one of those who had worked on nethack. The Dev is still updating the game with a patch adding a chunk of content a few days earlier, for those who wish to contact the dev with ideas or bug updates he can be found in the steam fourms and reddit fourms.For those who have not played a rogue like before, the goal of the game is to get to the bottom of the dungeon and defeat the final boss. The hard part is not defeating the final boss but survivng your own stupidity, often deaths are completely avoidable. For those who are looking for detailed skill trees do not have high expecations, the skill choices for each class are pretty shallow. This is not a gamed where the character is heavily defined by skill choices but is heavily defined by what  character you role, as they come with different restrictions. One example is barbarian who is easy to play with but can equip very little of the armors found which makes it harder to survive.This is not a game that you purchase for a nine year old unless he was born with a computer in his hands.

These are the reasons I kept WazHack in my wishlist for weeks.  When I finally came around to purchasing it, my experience was less than stellar.  I later grew to like the game after the issues below soured my first impression.Here are the top reasons I was more frustrated with Waz rather then enjoying my experience.- Game says it has full controller support.  Lie.  In the game you have to aim to shoot your bow, spells and to throw things.  Your controller cannot aim AT ALL.  You basically have to use your mouse to aim, and if you're using a controller, we all know how annoying that is.  The whole point to using a controller is to lean back and relax.- Some classes are just downright pointless!  Bard and bardess for example.  They either charm monsters or put them to sleep.  For the bardess, mobs put to sleep immediatly wake up when attacked.  So since you can only have your harp out and no other weapons, you just stand there and have your pet attack the mob.  Problem is, you don't get xp for mobs killed by your pet.  So I take it the developer figured bardess was hard mode because you'll  never level up.  Other than that, she can identify items a little better.  The bard charms mobs.  It's the same thing with this guy where you can only have your guitar out and nothing else.  So again, relying on your pets to attack other monsters.  The problem with this mechanic is, every time you want your pets to attack anything, you have to go to another screen and select ""Entire Entourage"" then select attack.  It is VERY tedious and ruins the fun.I had more frustration with the controller than the mechanics of the game.  Going through the game menu's was clearly thought of with a mouse and keyboard as there are several items to look at and scroll through.  I get it, you're playing on PC, why use a controller?  For alot of gamers, we don't like being hunched over a keyboard for longer than an hour.  It's just not comfortable.As for the RNG.  I like.  I have no problems with RNG in most games (other than Darkest Dungeon).  This is a dungeon crawler.  Which are meant to be difficult.  My issues above slightly ruined my initial first impression but I grew the love the game after I put in a few more hours.Now, if you don't mind using kb&m, and enjoy dieing to RNG, then you will thouroughly enjoy WazHack.  You will probably get many hours out of the game for 10 bucks."

I may change my review if they fix serious issues. Forgetting perfected spells is garbage; you don't forget a sword, you shouldn't forget a spell if your stats are maxed. It makes playing a spell caster impossible when books are so rare. Many mechanics don't work properly either. Items from wishes don't always appear on a successful wish, lightning doesn't recharge wands but will destroy them, blank spell books can't be filled with anything, and rooms respawn faster than you can catch your breathe.

But WazHack struggled to live up to my expectations. WazHack is a platforming dungeon crawler set in an epic dungeon called WazHack which I suspect was once part of an epic sewer system.Like old-school dungeon crawlers, when you’re not moving, neither is anything else; items are numerous and often cursed and likewise with the enemies (numerous and cursed that is, since they’re all skeletons). Why didn’t this game hold my attention? It turns out that WazHack is also available as a phone game and the graphics don’t translate well onto 32 inch monitor. The interface is a little clunky. A little more than clunky. While moving around and attacking was easy enough, using, equipping and consuming items was an ordeal of scrolling through menus, reading stats, and on-screen text.I did not enjoy my time playing this game. Considering the nature of roguelike games is that you die a lot and have to restart, there has to be a huge motivator to compel you to keeping playing. Going lower and lower into  a dungeon is just not enough to compel me.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/07/02/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-wazhack/"

It's a rogue-like (no, not rogue-lite) dungeon crawler Basically, you're in a dungeon, you need to fight your way to the bottom. The way you do it will almost always depend on what you find on the way down. With plenty of variety each run can be significantly differnt, even if you play the same character... except the barbarian/vandal. That goes one way; Smash-Smash-Smash-loot-smash!  You're a mage and can't find spell books? then you'd better hope you can find some strong wands or, gods forbid, learn to use a sword. You're a bard and you learn the ""wizard lock"" spell? then you're not gonna need that storytelling perk this run!As you may expect, the game gets harder the deeper you go, but you'll usually find enough just assistance, be it loot to sell, a bakery fend off starvation or a prisoner to release (they'll fight alongside you). The stat customisation is just the right balance of freedom to make you own character and being bound by the class you choose. E.g. your strongst White Witch will be far weaker than your weakest knight, but just as much smarter, yet you could still build a melee focused witch or a spellcasting knight.The biggest strength of the game is the randomization of the items - Any specific potion could be healling one round and acid the next and you won't know until you drink it or learn to identify it. the scrolls, wands, jewelry, musical instruments and spellbooks are similar. Even weapons and armour are only identifiable by style, the Stats could be anything. Anything could also hold a magical effect or be blessed for bonuses or cursed as your pet might tell you, and you can't unequip anthing cursed. You can throw pretty much anything at your enemies as long as it's not cursed (then it just gets stuck to your hand), distance depends on weight and strength.Stats don't seem to rise as you level (except health and magic) but theres other ways to make you tougher. You can become more skilled in your weapons or magic, or pick a good perk every level, but all in all you just need to play smart to surviveSo in summery. A complicated but brilliant game"

Yes, but that does not detract from your enjoyment of the game in any way. NetHack's graphics are ASCII-only - as are most of the RogueLike games - and it's still the most advanced and engaging RPG ever made.The gameplay heavily references NetHack, but it doesn't feel like a carbon copy. For example: you have weapons that can be enchanted, and magical scrolls that are unidentified at the start of the game. However, the movement is simpler - it's 2D instead of 3D. Hunger is less punishing and there aren't as many difficulty spikes on specific floors.All in all, this game is a great intro to the genre for new players.

Also, the game has a lot of text, so it forces him to play attention and read in order to know what is going on. It that a cursed sword, or a blessed sword?

Though shutting doors and some stuff can still be troublesome.  I recommend  adding some kind of outline on PC to show what your mouse is hovering over.

Don't let the ""time moves forward only when you do"" spiel fool you into thinking otherwise.  To me, the game is more of a subtle, turn based dungeon crawler game, spiffed up with BEAUTIFUL graphics, tough monsters, and nasty traps.  You start out with your choice of sixteen different characters, male and female versions of various classes BUT the sex also results in different player attributes, skills, and starting equipment.The dungeons are randomly generated.  I've played more than a half dozen times, and each time the dungeon map is different.  The gameplay is smooth.  Along the bottom of the screen are a number of handy, in-game actionable icons to attack, change equipment, cast a spell, etc.   Once you tried clicking on the buttons, and understand what they do, the game becomes intuitive.However, the game is surprisingly difficult for a number of reasons.  The first is permadeath, which players either love or hate.  If you make a careless error, or is unlucky when you open the closed door, you will die easily, no matter how high your character's level is.  So even if your character survives the first few levels, you could end up being surrounded or trigger a nasty trap that kills you easily.Second, survival in the game requires a prudent management of resources.  For example, I have learned, to my dismay, that your character can and WILL die of hunger.  When that occurs, your character dies REGARDLESS of the amount of health your character possesses.  Some food is dropped on occasion when you defeat a monster.  But the food may SPOIL over time, and if eaten, cause your character to be sick.  If your character is running low on health and/or mana, they may be regenerated by sleeping.  However if you character is hungry, the sleep will be interrupted, and your health/mana will not be replenished.Third, while you DO get a lot of loot, the problem is that they are not easily identifable.  You need an identify scroll to figure out the properties of the item, and more importantly whether it is CURSED.  To me, it is an artificial and unnecessary means of jacking up the difficulty of the game.  Scrolls, potions, wands, etc. have to be identified through trial use, and you hope that the item is not cursed.Fourth, just because you clear out an area of all monsters, it doesn't mean the area will STAY CLEARED.  In other words, the monsters can respawn quickly and attack you from behind if you don't paying attention.To play WazHack and go deep in the dungeon, you need patience, alertness, and lots and lots of luck.  Expect to die a lot, but you will have fun seeing how long you last and how high you score."

That said I am a fan of games like Spelunky and Dark Souls and this game will scratch that certain itch. It's just like the old random dungeon crawlers you remember but from a side scrolling perspective, and much more streamlined. Rolling a character and jumping in takes a second, and dying could take even less time. The game becomes addictive when you just want to try one more time, thinking you can do a little better next time, and never being sure of what's going to happen next. I was skeptical but was pleasantly surprised after playing. This VERY quickly became my favorite Hack-like."

And Nethack was pretty silly to begin with.   It appears as a 2D game, but I think it's closer to 1 and half.  The majority of the gameplay happens on levels, with ladders connecting them.  Mobs can follow you up and down the ladders, no stairscumming here, but for the most part it plays like a 1D leveler.  With Nethack rules.Mostly.  It's indisputable roguelike in its permadeath and its randomly generated items.  It's indisputable hacklike in its choice of items, punishments for testing scrolls and potions, and there are so many elements taken directly from hack it's beyond mistakable for anything else.  However, some of the most defining elements of hack are missing: prayer chiefly among them.  No more turn count, no more hoping your god will uncurse that item, and no more foodless achieves.  The E-Word is also unavailable, as are most of the options that were available from the # menu in hack.But it isn't Nethack, it's Wazhack.  It's added so many new things, it's got its own flavor.  The cartoony graphics are fun, especially when hallucinating.  The different classes are really different, even the male and female versions of a class have different playstyles.  I've only been playing a short while, but it seems balanced and just the right amount of accessibility.  It's hard, but I don't think it's too hard.  If you play it like an action game, you will lose.  If you play it like a roguelike, you'll have fun.It's not Nethack.  It's Wazhack, and that's ok."

Unlike most roguelikes, there is a time factor going on behind the scenes that make some characters get more ""turns"". When you are hasted you get more. When you are encumbered, you get less.Because the turn based nature of the game is somewhat hidden, you get the sense that it is a more action adventure game than it really is. Time flows by smoothly while you act, and it stays completely still while you do nothing. You can stop and ponder your move as long as you need before moving on.On the downside, Wazhack has a steep learning curve. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to winning is the fact that Wishing is almost a requirement unless you are very lucky, patient, or both. However, the wish system is not transparent at all. Protip? Dip coins in the well. The wiki page on wishing is recommended reading for you. Nothing else, just the wish page.The magic system and weapon system is involved. Magic falls on two diametrically opposed scales. Light versus Dark and Life versus Death. THere are five levels available on each scale, and you cannot have more than 5 total between each side. Since some spells are Level 4 and need Level 4 to use to full effect, fully mastering all forms of magic is impossible. Weapons work in a similar way; there are only so many 'upgrades' available for your spell and weapon skills, and once you run out that is it. However, weapons have no opposition; each type has 5 levels of skill.Like a true roguelike, identifying items and figuring out their properties is a huge part of the game. Don't be surprised if you put on a cursed item that won't come off really quick into the game. It happens. Curses can be removed, though so don't despair. Read the scrolls until you find the one that removes curses.Ah, yes, about that. What color potion has what effect (same for scrolls, wands, types of jewelry) change from one character to the next. The game randomizes it. The only constants I have seen in potions is that potions of oil and ink are always black, and potions of water are always clear. However, there is also one randomized clear and one black potion in the dungeon. Have fun in the dungeon! Or is it the fungeon?(Overall 8/10, Story 2*/10, Gameplay 9/10, Graphics 6/10, Sound 6/10, Replayability 10/10)*I don't include story in the final rating of roguelikes"

It's a permadeath game, so the successes you have and the wealth you build all feel very rewarding.Every skill and every talent that you can take upon level up is immediately evidenced in the gameplay mechanics.  There is no grind feel that you must burn through useless levels to reach a singular strength.  If you upgrade something, you'll see the difference.It's also the best use of RNG I think I've ever seen in a game.  There does not seem to be any restriction related to level or location that results in something not being potentially available to you.  It's not a boring wash/rinse/repeat of ""this is what to expect at level 1, and this is what to expect at level blah"".  You can literally start a game and have an amazing stroke of luck that puts you into a very positive flow.  You can also play very deep into the game and the whole way having felt like every breath may be your last.This last point means that even the worst deaths that make you think you hate the game will also be the reason why you start anew and get back to it.  The next attempt can quickly outshine your last.A suggestion for potential new players:  There are online sources (wiki) which can quickly guide you toward big success in the game.  For hardcore players, I recommend you don't use those online sources and first attempt to completely use your imagination when playing through this.  There are incredibly sensible and logical mechanics built into this game that make it very different from the normal dungeon crawler or rpg."
