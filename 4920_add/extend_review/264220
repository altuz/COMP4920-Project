,Recommended,264220,9994953,"Posted: 1 May, 2014",all,DeadonArrival09,"This game starts out alot like other games in the genre, learn to walk, jump and run to name a few. The levels become ever more devious as you progress but are never hard for the wrong reasons. One cool mechanic is the scenery/mood change after you die alot. And you will be dying alot. One tip, look carefully ahead of you for any traps that might not be easily apparent. The music is very good and sets the mood nicely for each set of levels. The scenery and backgrounds for each level are beautifully done and are pleasant on the eyes. The hero moves at a slow pace to begin with but before long you are running for your life from traps and ducking and dodging with the best of em. In each level a collectible can be found and in alot of cases, a new power is needed so collecting it must be done later. All in all the game offers value at and above the current price. It has its charm and challenges and will have you cursing every god you can name at times but as always, overcoming the challenges is its own reward. For what the game is and offers, it executes perfectly in every aspect and any platformer fan out there should rise to the challenge."

This, coupled with an astonishing soundtrack, make this game a must for the genre-lovers considering its current price.The only downside is the current lack of workshop content; it would be nice to see user-created levels in the near future to lengthen even more the game experience.Note that at the time of writing this review, I've roughly completed about 1/3 of the game. In no way does my playtime reflect the actual duration of this game. Considering the levels get more and more complicated (NOTE: The difficulty curve in this game is pretty good), I assume it will last between 2:30 and 3:30 hours.EDIT: I am about to finish this game, only about 10 levels left including a couple special levels, and still lots of achievements to earn. I'd say my estimation of a little more than 2:30h was kind of accurate. The difficulty in the final levels is still a bit challenging, though I find that I may struggle with a level but then complete the next one in just one go. However, the game is still as fresh as when I bought it, and I am enjoying every second of frustration and satisfaction of it."

I've actually beaten the original Flash incarnation of this game before, so this is less a review and more of a comparison/series of general thoughts.Mr. Bree was, and still is, an enjoyable cartoon platformer. Through a series of 60 levels, you'll control the titular pig as he runs and jumps through a series of increasingly-difficult locations, ranging from simple forests to abattoirs and everything in-between.I never got the sense that this was as difficult as any of the Meat Boy games, as there seemed to be a lot of leeway in difficulty - I never felt it was impossible to complete a stage, and the levels feel like they were designed to reward people who practiced the wall-jumping/double-jumping and wanted to speedrun them.Much like Meat Boy, though, the story is near-irrelevant fluff meant to tie certain worlds together. The whole pretext of the story is a pig waking up with amnesia after escaping from a slaver, and he has forgotten most of his basic skills. I felt that this concept (of having to learn your abilities) could have been taken a lot further. While there are opportunities to go back to earlier levels and get items with unlocked abilities, the levels themselves never really play up the fact that you're limited in mobility for a certain stretch of time. Contrast that to something like Don't Move, which rewards you based on trying and/or failing to increase your mobility or set of abilities. Once you unlock double-jumping, most of the levels become a breeze and there's no real threat to any of the obstacles.Still, I found it to be an enjoyable romp, and for the price point (usually around $3, but less during sales), you could do a whole lot worse."

,Recommended,264220,10023879,"Posted: 4 May, 2014",all,KewaG,"Good game. Highly recommended for fans of platformers.The story is decent though I felt that it lacked something. Can't quite put my finger on what exactly it lacked but it kept me interested long enough to actually complete it. At first I tried to play using just the keyboard but quickly switched to my gamepad.NOTE: I recommend using a gamepad as it makes some of the tighter places in the game much easier to reach.One complaint I have is that you can't change the controls. I would rather have used the triggers for the run ability and whenever I pushed the thumbstick in, the game paused causing me to die after I resumed the game. A couple of places in the game I glitched out and had to restart the level which was a little annoying. Luckily the levels are not that big so not much progress was lost.The game is fairly short but enjoyable. Can't say it has much replayability but I only paid $2.00 for it so I'm not complaining. I like the allusion to a sequel at the end. If you buy it and play it you'll see what I mean. I do hope there will be a sequel but this time around a little more focus on the overall story would be very nice. One annoying feature of the game, when you die a number of times the background changes color and throws shadows on the game which sometimes makes it harder to play. Sometimes it's raining, which doesn't make much difference to the way the character interacts with the world but is annoying. Key solution? DON'T DIE!SpoilerIf you do buy this game and play it, note that the Wild Boar boss at the end is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Just keep moving and don't let him or anything he throws touch you and You'll be okay! NOTE: That it's easier said than done!"

,Not Recommended,264220,10982686,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,Stappi,"Mr. Bree plus deceived me with it's cute art style into believing it might be a fun little platforming adventure. It actually tries to be somewhere between Super Meatboy and an unfair platformer. For me it is rather an unfair (albeit beatable) one because of bad controls and communication. The game forces controller users to use the analog stick for movenment controls where a directional pad would feel more appropriate. Traps are hard to see and often require sheer luck. New mechanics are introduced in a conterintuitive manner - the wall jump for example is aquired in in a tight space with no way to try out immediatly.My ""favourite"" aspect of the game is a red tint that appears when you start to many times on a level. It makes it even harder to see traps dangers and, well, anything."

Really, purely, one of the worst wall jumps I've ever seen in a platformer. Doesn't tend to work properly is most of the problem... gets pre-empted by double jump a lot. As well, there's some problematic level design; Level 5 and Level 60 both stick in my mind as having the biggest issues, but there's a lot scattered throughout.But... on the whole it's generally okay. Not amazing, but for the price you pay it's not overcharging you or anything. The levels are generally pretty nice, a lot of mechanics and decent variety. It's competent, at the very least. I enjoyed it as a whole. Still far from perfect but I can tell the devs at least put their heart into it."

You are a pig...walking on 2 legs for whatever reason and everything around you is going to gut you. There are spikes, arrows, traps etc. Every level introduces new elements. There is also 1 puzzle piece per level which you can collect to unlock a sort of prologue.The character will frequently share his thoughts with you if you enable it in the options although you will often miss it, because the game is quite demanding. It calls itself ""hardcore"" I think, but it's not Super Meatboy level insane. It plays a lot slower and more determined, although some passages seem to be only manageable by pure luck (arrows so fast you can barely see them) and those are extremely annoying. Luckily though the game handles pretty decently. Your character moves when you tell him to and stops when you tell him to, even in mid air, which took some getting used to. He just stops dead when you release the button.You can also get 5 special powers. The first of which is how to jump (lol that was kinda funny). The game gets increasingly more complex (1st of 3 official ""chapters""). It also looks kinda neat and is challenging, but mostly fair, as you get a multitude of check points during each level. The only real gripe I got with it is the setting. You're in a forest and that's it apparently (with exception of the slaughterhouse prologue you can gradually unlock). Also when you die the screen often changes colour (I think this is to simulate daylight and night time?).Hands down the best thing about this is the beautiful and soothing sound track though. Whoever composed it is a genius and deserves your money. If it were purchaseable I'd buy it. It is eerily enchanting and ominous."

It is generally easy to pick up, but it gets progressively harder as you go on with a ton of traps ready to kill you at any time.Mr Bree balances the hardcore nature of the gameplay with very generous checkpoints. This is nice for players who might be a little intimidated by a harder platform game as you can easily make progress even after dying a lot.I highly recommend this game as it was quite fun. With the game time above I was able to complete the game and also spend a lot of time in hardcore mode, which is truly brutal towards the end. There are tons of achievements and you can also collect items inside the levels to unlock more levels. For the money it was well worth it, as it's a great game with a reasonable amount of content.One small gripe I do have about the game is the changing color scheme within the levels. The color scheme of a level will change after you die about 5 times, and this will repeat in going through certain colors or weather effects. This would be a cool effect if it didn't dramatically change how the screen looks. The red color was quite annoying as it was very difficult to see. Of course I could just suicide my character until the color scheme changed, but I feel it is something the developers should look into and consider changing.The 2 boss fights in the game are ok, but don't feel too fun because of their boring mechanics that are reused between both of them. I feel more time and creativity could go into them to make them more interesting, or just remove them in favor of hard platforming.These are my only complaints, and this game was still pretty great and I'm glad I purchased it.

You are a pig who has suffered total memory loss. The story is strange but also funny and enjoyable and it adds a lot more depth to the game than other Indie Platformers where you just grind through levels, not knowing why. The worlds are full of traps, so you may die a lot trying to figure out how to get through the level and collect all items. Personally I'd actually enjoy it more than Super Meat Boy if it worked on my PC.The game was coded using Flash, so basicly it has no way to utalize the hardware of my PC which in turn makes it glitchy, constantly crashing, and after a few levels time seems to slow down so reaction times for me are still the same, but projectiles and traps engage so slowly that I can easily out manuver them and avoid them. At first I thought the slowing effect was part of the game because I was dying so much, but once I restarted the game, the effect was gone until I beat a few more levels and then it was back again.Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I am running a 5 year old computer with an i5 2.3 ghz processor and a ATI HD 5470 graphics card with 512 mbs of ram, but I doubt it. Other platformers play perfectly with exception to Fez which is understandable considering it's complexity. I want to like Mr. Bree+ but as it stands broken right now, I highly recommend that you save your $3 and put a down payment on a less buggy platformer."

Thus, you begin your platforming adventure through the forest.First, the good: The art style is very nice and the music is pretty good as well. Checkpoints are provided for most levels, so you can pass even the harder levels without too much difficulty. These can be turned off when you unlock hardcore mode. There are collectibles to find that unlock extra levels and the rest of the story. The level design is nice for the most part.The bad: The game is riddled with bugs. The game crashes and freezes randomly, has poor controller support, and environments that blend together and make it hard to distinguish foreground and background. Wall jumping feels janky and the controls in general do not feel tight enough to be in a 'hardcore-style' platformer. There's also a mechanic where the time of day changes each time you die in a level. Some of the lighting schemes for certain times of day render traps and pitfalls nearly invisible, making levels that you are already having trouble with even harder simply because you can't see anything.For $2.99, I didn't expect a lot from the game. It feels like there is a decent platformer hiding somewhere beneath the bugs and issues and I think I could recommend it if some things got fixed. As it is, I'd rather just play Super Meat Boy."
