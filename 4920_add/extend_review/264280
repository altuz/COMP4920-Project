,Not Recommended,264280,12368141,"Posted: 4 October, 2014",all,The Ripper {Panda},"This game is seriously just horrible. You wonder ""hey a rogue-like dungeon crawler side-scroller based on hell, that sounds awesome!"" Let me tell you this game is not what it seems like. They shouldn't even be allowed to advertise this as a rogue-like game. This game is like Spelunky's mentally challenged cousin. Lets go through the pros and cons.PROS:- Its only 5 dollars.Alright moving on to the cons.CONS:- Lack of music. Through out the levels all you get is ""eerie"" ambience sounds. No real music. When you're running out of time or fighting bosses, you get really cool metal music. But that's the only time you get cool music.- Enemies. They look like they were done in MS paint by a 5 year old.- Lack of variety. This is NOT a rogue-like game. You'll notice you're in the same exact rooms over and over again. Even in later levels, its the same exact room just looks different. You'd swear there's only like 10 unique rooms, and out of 100 total rooms? That's just sad.- Not many items. Seriously, I've only collected maybe like 5 items total from all the time I've spent playing. All you come across in abundance is gold, but you'll be lucky to even afford something as small as a heart from the shops. You get barely around 10 to 20 pieces of gold per room, but all the items in the shop are like 500 and 600. You're only hope is to gamble it and try to get more gold from it. There are simply not enough items in this game to make it seem fun and refreshing with each play through, let alone on your first play through.- Bosses are a joke. Seriously, usually the bosses just move from side to side summoning enemies. They literally don't attack half the time. I'm stuck on the level 60 boss right now. Why? All the boss does is fly from left to right but it summons so many enemies you can't even hit the boss. There's like 30 flying little robots on the room and still spawning, it becomes impossible to hit the boss let alone survive.- Only 2 types of enemies every 10 levels. Yeah, and they're usually just reskins of older enemies. Just like the level layouts. They don't do sh*t either, they usually just fly around in random patterns and, well, thats it.- Hit boxes are garbage. You get hit whenever your character feels like getting hit.- Developers seem to have abandoned this game. Same goes for the community. Nobody is really playing this nor talking about it in the discussions anymore. I can't imagine the developers are still polishing this up anyways...Seriously, save yourself 5 dollars and go get some food or something. This game sucks..."

I am if anything below average at this genre of game. Draw your own conclusions.)Hard call, this one. $5 is not a large asking price; you're getting better value for money than the quarter of a movie or most-of-a-hamburger said cash would otherwise afford you, and this game Is pretty enjoyable for the first hour or so.Problem is, It's simply not a lot of fun after that point. You will very swiftly notice yourself running through the same room patterns again and again, not looking for new weapons after the first area because throwing away all the upgrades you've accrued thus far is a ridiculous waste and likely to get you killed. Soundtrack isn't exactly memorable, what passes for a ""story"" is a poorly conceived joke with no bearing on the game itself relayed in doggrel verse that's almost painful to listen to, graphics just feel amateurish...The core ideas are fun enough that you probably won't feel cheated purchasing this. But do so only if desperate; there are better games here with more potential costing just as much or less. ""Spelunky"" rings a bell: If you haven't already purchased that one, there's no reason to buy this in preference."

The poor controls, unskippable narration, pretty much everything else that would make the game a solid experience on PC being absent? Not ready for prime time.

The physics system is horrible to a point where at level 20 I fell from the top of the level to the bottom without taking any damage what so ever.Assets of the game look to be drawn by a 6 year old (at best) where some texture qualities look quite well done.If you are still unconvinced to not buy this game watch the video in the review.Free to Play or no play at all.Play Spelunky or The binding of Isaac for a more immersive and in-depth feel to a rogue-like.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VghweD3h8EA

It is not polished enough to be recommended.As you can see, I have played for a very short time. You should probably know how the progress in this game works: Each 10 levels you fight a boss and open a door, from where you can start your next game if you want to.In my third run I died at level 3 and the game bugged, opening all doors up to level 60. While this is not game breaking, it ruins the ""progression"" and work you should do to get there, it is like cheating whitout wanting to cheat. It felt very cheap.While I spent 100's of hours in other rogue-likes like Bindind of Isaac, Dungeons of Dreadmor, Spelunky, Hero Siege, Rogue Legacy, etc, I could not keep playing this game. Even some Early Alpha games are better polished and have better value than this. I do not recommend buying this game."

For starters the music is bad (and the ""hurry up"" music is awful) and the graphics don't do it any favors. Game mechanics clash with each other and seem to have been thrown in on a whim (the ""spelunky ghosts"" being the most striking example, but the casinos also seemed pretty sloppy), and the game seems to discourage you from experimenting with its many weapons (of which you can only carry one anyways). And the room design is awful to boot. I would recommend that nobody buy this; if you want a roguelike just buy/replay Spelunky or Isaac or Risk of Rain, and if you want an action game there's no shortage of better ones."

It's an action-platforming rogue-lite game that provides a couple of hours of interest and fun...but not much more above that.  Fans of action platformer or rogue-lite games may get a lot of playtime and enjoyment out of this, but more casual players or fans will be pretty underwhelmed.  Why?  First of all, instead having a lot of randomization, you'll actually begin to notice that a lot of the levels are just re-skinned versions of previous levels you have played.  Also, there isn't much balancing with with weapons / power-ups.  The player is either going to feel frustrated that their weapon isn't doing squat or they are going to feel invincible by lucking across a stupidly strong weapon (hello green orb / bubble gun).  This game is worth the price, especially if you find it on sale...but don't expect to get your socks blown off."

As the name states you have to get through 99 levels before you get to Hell.  You start out as level 1 (of course) and every 10th level you have a boss battle.

,Recommended,264280,9214236,"Posted: 21 February, 2014",all,TheMLGReploid,"99 levels to hell feels more like a journey through hell, as per it's insane difficulty. Each level is randomly generated, as per the usual dungeon crawler, with plenty of items and creatures to find. If you've played spelunky you should have a good idea of what you're getting yourself into.The premise of 99 levels to hell is that you are a dark wizard, whose light brother and mother have both been killed, and you are journeying into hell to kill Satan and get your revenge, or at least I'm guessing. The plot of 99 levels to hell is slowly unraveled as you play via hidden rooms that occasionally show up.The gameplay of 99 levels to hell is fairly standard, a platformer where you have to find the exit to progress to the next level, however 99 levels to hell mixes things up, as you must find a key in order to unlock the exit, making each level a bit longer, as the area of the level itself is not as big as Spelunky. Like Spelunky, this game features permadeath, however here you can save and quit at anytime, though it costs 1 heart. The game is seperated into 10 dungeons, each with a unique feel and theme to fit with a boss fight at the end. Not to mention some unique traps and enemies. However most enemies are re-skins of ones seen previously with higher stats, which is unfortunate. The dungeons are listed below from first to last.1: The Castle2: The Green Underground3: The Dungeon4: The Machine5: The Wet Caves6: The Beast7: The Next Dimension8: The Unknown9: The Necropolis10: HellThe games most notable feature is its soundtrack, which is incredibly good for an indie game. Each area has an eerie and unique theme, with some very heavy metal to pump you up during the boss fight. However it isn't as scary as it could be due to good lighting and poorly made cartoon enemies and bosses, which use stock death sounds that are far too silly considering what they are. While this does add some charm, I feel that if a sequel was made it could use better enemy design and quality to increase the scare factor.Like spelunky, you can grab treasure (gold nuggets) to buy items in shops, and bombs to blast stone blocks, and find items in crates and chests. however the dirt blocks can be destroyed by any weapon, including enemy shots. This reduces the exploration factor by a large amount, but 99 levels to hell seems more orientated torwards combat.The worst part by far, however about 99 levels to hell is its art style, it isn't necessarily bad for the most part, but inconsitent and poorly animated. The backrounds clearly are done in great detail, but most enemies are done very badly, and have little animation. Many of the objects in the game also are done differently, and it looks as if different images were taken and pasted into the game. A prime example of the poor animation is your ladder climbing animation, which is 2 sprites with one foot raised above the other. This is very lazy, and can greatly reduce the immersion this game can provide.All in all, 99 levels to hell is a fun experience, with interesting story and fun gameplay, it is well worth the $5. However the game is not perfect, as it has multiple flaws which just look like laziness, but it is still fun. All the comments below are from people who played for 5 minutes and were not instantly entertained. If you are a fan of platformers, side-scrolling shooters, roguelikes or all of the above, I would reccomend this game, just give it a bit of time, as the first 2 dungeons are not too difficult, but the game will get harder, that is a gaurantee.Final score: 7/10"

Boring and if you take too long, random generated ghosts will spawn and attack you. It's not only one. This can be even up to 5. They are sometimes unavoidable and you will be able to take damage.

In each level there is a bonus available. Completing the bonus will give you a higher score. There are buffs and powerups in the castle.

It's not too bad - it's essentially the developers showing off their weird experimentation with the formula that Spelunky was based on. Unfortunately, there's issues with tone, because it sounds like a weird mashup of 'knockout power chord' sounding metal, Haunted House Halloween Noises Volume 17, and Super Mario Bros. It forgets that the game is about descending to Hell and does the thing where it sometimes places the exit door in a hard to reach place, unlike Spelunky which puts the exit door at the bottom to give it a sense of continuity. The casino rooms are built by people that don't know what the appeal of gambling is. A lot of this game feels unrefined and like it is in need of tightening up and revision. Unfortunately, since I've been playing the recently revised 2.0 version, I'm not sure the developers are on the right track with this game.

The only thing correct is the games name, there is 99 levels that are almost exactly the same where you fight really boring enemies that have serve no real threat to you while you try to find a key to the exit. the game has no replay value and is not fun in the slightest. The only time i got kind of excited (just to be let down) was when i got to the first boss and that wasnt even fun because the game is so poorly made that they just try to throw everything at you so you die unfairly, but it even fails at that because everything moves so slowly and so uneventfuly that you see something coming for you and you can just jump out of the way. I checked out the trailer after playing the game just to see how they even sold the game. I'm sure that in the trailer for the game all they did was just speed up the gameplay to make it seem more fun. they added this actually not bad rock music in the trailer but you don't even get that in the game. I did buy this game for only fifty cents, but I still dont think it's worth it at that price. I usually don't bash games like this, but god is it uninspired and lazy. I think that if the game was free then it would be worth a play for people who have litterally no money to spend on steam games."

It does not generate 100 unique levels however.. more like 12-15 level templates that are re-populated depending on which dungeon you are in. I think the developer made a mistake enabling cheat codes in the game.. considering that it does not affect achievements - though this may sound attractive to some, considering it is ******* hard without them ;) The game is not bad and worth a look - though it does not exactly offer a wealth of variety."

I was amused by the character of the game, it feels very hand made.  I also like djent and the guy obviously cares about his soundtrack.  It also works great on Linux.But know this is not a rogue-like, which is what I was expecting. Just a simple mechanic (think bubble bobble meets binding of isaac).  I never finished it. I gave up when I was teleported back to the start, (note: randomly forcing your users to lose progress made me quit playing). It appears every level is the same except randomly generated, and once you pass a time threshold a number of ghosts equal to the level you are at come out from the edges of the screen. You also get random weapons as you play, but they were just a bit frustrating to use.The basic movement controls feel a bit too floaty for my tastes and can be frustrating when trying to navigate.  You can miss jumps too easily which cause you to have to re-navigate the level.It kind of feels like a flash game, except way smoother.The basics are all there for this developer to go on to do great things, it just didn't come together for me this time."

I like roguelikes, have beaten hell in Spelunky, run through Binding of Isaac now and again, and all that.  The core concept of the game is solid, but plays like a cut-rate Mexican version of Spelunky.  The first hour or two are interesting and challenging, but once you get the goofy mechanics of controling your character, and upgrade your weapon a little it becomes really really grindy.  What at first seems like a decent spread of items, and modifications, pretty quickly gets kind of boring.  Get to shop, buy any weapon upgrades you can, get the heart sign to regenerate hearts, rinse, wash, and repeat.The enemies suffer from the same lack of originality, and you start to see repeats of limited behaviors with variation in sprites.  Same thing with the levels.  I realize the developer had to come up with some way to have 99 levels, but an extra couple of room layouts would have broken up the monotony.So...the upside is potential, right?  If another five or ten weapons could be come up with that would keep things fresh.  Same with the other items...and enemies...and rooms.Catch it on sale for a buck or so if you want, but honestly, just go buy Spelunky for a much more polished and fun game (or wait for the new Binding of Isaac).  I'll keep an eye on the developer, and see what he comes up with next, but for now I'm on level 51 and just kind of losing interest."

Which inturn contributes to very good cost efficiency.In 99 Levels you get to pick your character and then attempt to make it through... you guessed it 99 levels.  Throughout the game you encounter cool little voice acted story bits as well as a bunch of hidden pathways that let you expediate your progress(beware though, don't bite off more than you can chew).

Enemies are easy to deal with and little threat to the player beyond moving hit boxes. Powerups are straight up booring. Increasing bullet size, dmg, range ext bearly changes up gameplay. I had to acctualy look up half the effects seeing how it made little to no difference visualy. Specials are equaly lack luster. Mainly random symbols that kill everything on the screen or the random floating hitbox revolving around the character. They dont even have any effects, there just a stickers of doom. The players character model bothers me as well. He's so static, like a statue moving around with one of the most anoying jump sounds I've ever heard in a game.I really wanted to like this game but I just cant reccomend it. Its not all bad though. Bosses are pretty fun to fight. There is a fairly interesting (if not somewhat reminesent of Issac) story to listen to. There are nice dynamic lighting effects and the metal riff when the ghost appears is pretty cool. Other than that there isnt realy a reason to pick this one up. There are other games out there that do this sort of thing much better."
