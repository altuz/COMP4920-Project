I wasnt looking for insane graphics all I wanted was something fun that worked with no glitches. This game delivered. Its just straight up fun to shoot the hell out of the creative enemys. Loads of progression and replay value here. Your constintly trying to keep the horde at by while picking up as much cash as possible for that next upgrade. Its good old fashion shoot em up fun.
,Not Recommended,264300,17603889,"Posted: 18 August, 2015",all,Tom,"Guns n Zombies is a top down shooter in which you fight, you guessed it, Zombies. You fight hoards and hoards of them. This game was released in late 2014.You control one of two playable characters, one seems to be more of a standard run and gun character whilst the other is more of an engineer. You have two weapon slots in which you can customize which weapons you can carry by buying different ones via the upgrade shop. The currency that is used drops from various different zombies as you mow your way through the hoards.  Your character also has a special abilities, which have a timed cool down, and these again can be upgraded through the shop.  This game also tries to add in a little bit of tower defense mechanics too, each level has a number of different ""build points"" - where you can build your turrets, ranging from explosive cannons, to machine guns, or just something as simple as a slowing down sort of turret.  To me this feature seemed a little bit pointless as it didn't really add anything to the game for me.The controls are very simple. WASD to move around, mouse to shoot, and the number keys for your special abilities. To me this seemed like the best option over using a controller, but some may prefer to play twin stick shooters on a game pad.Graphically I felt like Guns n Zombies was not really up to par, it just looked dated and run down. Most of the textures were certainly not high res, animations look a bit weird, and environments just looked bland and boring if I am honest. All of the menus were also in a strange aspect ratio that I had never seen before. They looked like they were made for the hard of hearing.I am going to be honest, I lost track of the story about half way through - the game does a really bad job of explaining what is going on, it's all in sort of a Power point presentation show in between each level, and offers no clues on what is actually happening. For me to ended up getting to the end with no idea as to what had transpired.The difficulty in Guns n Zombies is actually pretty high. I was finding my self dying on the early levels, and often found my self having to go back to the previous stage just to earn more currency so I could buy the next weapon up. For me, that is just a badly designed way of doing it. I shouldn't be made to replay the content I have just done in this type of game - I could understand it in an MMO of sorts, but not a twin stick shooter like this.A playthrough on single player took me just under four hours to finish. For me that felt like way longer than I would of liked it to have. Maybe this was because I just wasn't enjoying my time playing, I don't know. Where all of the compliments and positive reviews seem to come into play, is the multiplayer co-op. Personally I wasn't able to find anyone to play with, so I was stuck with the single player. If you can get a few friends together to play, you may well have a ton more fun than on your own.Apart from the strange aspect resolution on the menus, there are no major bugs that I encountered, everything seemed to run smoothly at the higher resolutions, which is always a plus point.Sadly I am not going to recommend Guns n Zombies here; I just didn't have fun whilst playing it. It felt very vanilla, slow and just not fun to play. I would say that you really should not pick this up if you are planning to play it as a single player game, you probably will not have fun at all. If you are going to get one or two friends together to play co-op, sure, playing with friends makes everything better, but I can certainly see it making Guns n Zombies all together more fun. I would say pick it up if it drops below 50% off, just because it offers a good pick up and play feel, but nothing more than that.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

There's a story of sorts, but nothing that you'll remember.  There are a few bosses, but the bosses are extrememly easy to beat and the stages are very small and boring.  You can also place turrets in marked spots that either shoot at the monsters, slow them down or pulse a damaging element.There's a lot of weapons and armor to buy, but only one gun really matters.  Once you buy the electric gun and upgrade your armor that alone will net you victory!  Each gun you buy whether it's the machine gun, sniper rifle, grenade launcher, shotgun or the god like electric gun can be upgraded 3 times then the next tier of the same gun is purchasable.  The same goes for the armor and once you reach a new character level you can purchase new armor that can be upgraded 3 times to make stronger.  All the weapons can be carried at the same time and cycled through.There are a lot of different types of monsters throughout the levels and that's a good thing.  By the time you reach the end of the game you would have seen 10+ different types.  There's a survival mode that you can compete in also.  This mode is just to see how long you can last and there's a leaders board that shows EVERYONE that has bought the game and their score.The game itself is around 3 hours or so, but with grinding to upgrade your weapons and getting achievements you can triple the game time.  I'd definitely grab this game on sale (including the DLC for $1 total) to get a few hours of enjoyement, but it's not worth it at all for the asking price.  5/10.  Fun at times, but forgettable."

76561198277247864,Not Recommended,264300,30974435,Posted: 5 April,all,Flameheart,"lol this game.I bought it simply because it is made by Krealit and I liked their I am Weapon (not ""I am Weapon: Revival"". That one is trash too, don't buy).Pros:okay-level graphics and visual effectsrelatively simple mechanisms and neat interfaceCons:nearly everything else-trash music and sound effects-poor artwork-poorly designed level difficulty and ridiculously stupid objectives. Sometimes asking you to not gain more than 500 credits so you have to NOT kill anything on easiet difficulty and try to pass the stupid level quick, sometimes asking to gain 20K credits which is impossible to get within one try even on hardest difficulty so you have to play twice. Sometimes asking you to not get attacked by acid or witches, in which levels there are tons of acid and witches, while the spider suffers from route finding and targeting so they spit acid everywhere with total randomness. And sometimes asking you to get gasoline, which is hidden in a very twisted and chaotic maps, while your jeep is left to be attacked....Why are even all those objectives? Who the hell designed them and what are the purposes of them?-gaming balance in early game and late game are both literally garbage. You just can't pass some early levels without multiple tries after gaining enough money and ranks, however the game would end far earlier before you gain the final tier weapons, while unlocking them simply means you need to repeat some levels, which is an extraordinarily boring and painful experience-boring, long and repetitive gaming progress. You are just shoting at the enemies that doesn't seem intimating at all regardless of whatever the new type of zombies came up for you. Those recurring ""signature"" krealit monsters are just reused assets from former franchaise. Getting new weapons? Cool. It would look different, but the actual effects and damage doesn't differ much.-monster design is bad af. The models look totally not cool, feels ugly and unappealing, not terrifying or exciting enough to make you want to kill, absoultely ruining your will to continue on-boring and repetitive DLC, which also has bad monster design and making-no-sense plot (spoliers: aliens crashed on earth get infected by zombies and becoming zombies aliens...whatever this stupid idea is, you get my point: don't buy the DLC)-weapon effects and monster actions in most of the times does not make sense. the most readily seen cops can use their cheap riot shield to block everything, even the highest tier late game super fantastic space sniper railgun, which is described as able to ""penetrate toughest armor""-poor map design, tons of unnecessary obstacles hindered your path-poor maintainence. Knowing that all those garbage are actually made quite a while ago, you may ask why didn't the developers fix them? Well the fact is they TOTALLY don't care at all. They just make it, throw onto the shelf, no updates, no bug fixes, and letting it be bad and rotten to disguest you.-game has quite a bit of bugs to be fixed. Okay cool, how many years have passed since the game released, and why aren't they fixed yet?Just don't buy. Even when it is on sale. You are playing to torture yourself."

The game is also rather confusing as it lacks much of a tutorial system (it took me a minute to figure out how to use turrets and abilities, as the ingame prompts aren't very clear).  For an early access there are a good number of levels, and there is an upgrade system but I haven't played enough to really comment on it yet.  The game also features laughably bad english which adds...character.  If they can iron out some of the control clunkiness this will be well worth the effort, but now, well, its a clunky zombie filled dubstepy Alien Breed!"

I would recommend this game to anyone a fan of this genre or zombie games.There is one con I have found in this game, you get stuck on random objects, forcing you to scramble a few directions to get unstuck.  It happens more than it should and for how great of a game this is, it's a buzz kill.

To be honest they need to have requirement if the company want use early access on steam they shouldn't have revenue over 500k, unless a small indie company makes a good first game and does another early access. Big name companies are running the early access purpose by trying to lure customers in with it, it really needs to stop.

Unfortunately, it is. Like other twin-stick shooters you are mostly evading the throng of constantly-pursuing enemies while using various AOE abilities while kiting them around the environments. The main zombie enemy design is pretty lackluster and cartoony-looking, but other enemies look a little bit cooler. I played 2 of the 3 main characters available and they both seemed pretty lame stylistically, with simple animations and very little personality to their attacks or movement. The (concept) art inbetween levels during cutscenes is all really well done, though.. From the art depicted in the cutscenes to what is actually in the game seem very different tonally.The game's biggest problem is that your attacks / guns / weapons don't have any ""oomph"" to them, with simplistic visuals and weak-sounding weapons. You may be making zombies explode from explosive barrels and mowing them down with a shotgun, but the game lacks any bass or bravado to most of these attacks, and the enemy death animations are boring as well, with most consisting of little more than the same spurt of blood effect and slumping over a bit. It quickly grows stale feeling like you've seen much of what the game will offer within the first few minutes of playing.Co-op is probably a bit more fun, and some of the timing to eliminate the enemies can be fun, I guess, but not standout at all. The game functions fine and is free of bugs in my brief playtime, but it's pretty generic. I bought a bundle including the DLC pack for the game, including Aliens in an expansion, but I can't seem to figure out how to get it to boot up so I'm uncertain if it's any better. It seems like the enemy and weapon designs in that would perhaps be more unique. Unfortunately for this title as-is, if you've shot a zombie with a gun in a game before, it was probably more enjoyable than doing so here."

Money does not come as quickly as you think so upgrades are important decisions based on your preferred style of gameplay, although sometimes it feels as though money does not come quick enough and you have to grind to upgrade something to help you with the next level.Arena mode or whatever its called seems to have been hacked though - dissapointing.

I pushed forward, however, hoping to find some satisfaction from leveling and purchasing new guns, but the game's premise, though somewhat fun-sounding, just gets old. It's top-down, twin-stick-shooter-style running around, shooting swarms of zombies (and later, aliens) coming at you endlessly until you complete an objective, or until you hold out until they're all dead (depending on if it's an offense or defense mission). It's never really anything more than that. Sometimes, simplicity in a game can be fun and invigorating, but that wasn't the case with this game for me. Even the different character classes and drone summons, etc. just didn't make the game fun for more than an hour."

The graphics and game play is solid though nothing inventive I’ll be honest, the price tag however, made it all very worthwhile.There are 19 stages of which you can blast through with 2 characters in the core game, each stage has their own difficulty slider and objectives, so you’ll be grinding for a while to complete everything in full. During my 20 hours worth of game time, this did not feel dull for one bit as I unlock different tiers of equipment and abilities.As for the down side the game is unpolished in some areas with its typos and grammatical mistakes, the biggest gripes I had surprisingly were the stage sceneries, made too small and too dark to make out on the map but just big enough to block your path completely. These inanimate obstacles were more deadly than the zombies themselves, the only real annoyance I had to suffer with.I would recommend this any time of the day, even more so during a sale, just don’t buy this expecting a big budget title."

It's fun forsure, but there are many bugs and glitches, lag and issues in certain parts of the game.Sometimes there are deadzones in which enemies just do not move or want to atk.  It's almost gamebreaking when you notice these spots.  You can make em bunch up and they don't harm you.Also normal and hard modes are way too easy.  The difficulty here isn't even with the zombies and the dmg you take or the hordes, it's the deceptive hitboxes that wont allow you to hit them at times along with the exploding barrels.  The invisible walls and the being able to walk through some ""objects"" is mislead as well.As for the contrast or brightness, it's difficult to see with the games color scheme.  You can't really adjust it and it's too dark when it shouldn't be and also too bright where it's blinding.  The zombies have terrible animations.  The graphics aren't stellar, which i could dismiss if the game was solid, but it's not.  The artwork in both the drawings and CG/rendered stuff just seems off.The game seems too generic, either the similarities from other games are too noticeable or it's just not standing out.  I've played games with less data consumption that look better because of the execution and charm.  This game seems to lack that.Again fun game, many bugs, like weird weird bugs with quests or enemies and it's annoyingly upsetting because you wanna get into the game, but you just tend to get taken out of the game because of these things.  It's not fun when parts get messed up or you're suffering with realization of old mechanics and glitches that appear in older consoles come up in a game like this."

For example, on my friends MacBook, everytime he died while playing in fullscreen mode, he couldn't click on anything.Now on to the good parts. Personally, I am very fond of games in which you can upgrade your character or your weapons. This game is a great example of one of these. You buy weapons with in-game currency and you can upgrade them. You can also buy armor and skill upgrades. I love the design of the characters in this game. The zombies look intimidating but fun at the same time.

,Recommended,264300,18859263,"Posted: 3 November, 2015",all,kschang77,"GnZ is one of those twin-stick shooters that have you shoot in all directions and move in all directions against horde of zombies (or aliens). And it is a horde. And often you are alone. Later you'll be able to deploy turrets using some nano-techno-thingamajig (not your expertise) with some bigwig scientist's help, but maybe he started it? But you don't really play this game for the plot, do you? It's just one mission after another, attack through an area, blast the objectives, etc. etc. Collect ""money"" and ""nanopower"" from the dead zeds, use them to upgrade your weapons and equipment (and you can switch among your weapons, like assault rifle, shotgun, electro gun, grenade launcher... ) including the turrets. And that's about it. With multiple starting characters (more healing, more turret, more shooting) and different upgrade paths, there's a little bit of RPG feel to it, but most of the time you're just too busy shooting.Graphics are a bit lo-fi for a 2014/2015 game but the things move at a good clip. Sound's unremarkable. Gameplay is exciting but rather repetitive. Developers do come up with some variations including defense, attack, clear area, but there are only so many ways to kill zeds.Overall, GnZ is one of those games that you should only buy when it's on sale."

The game is glitchy. It has bad camera angles where if you go to the edge of the map, the level begins to stutter. The enemies are a bunch of bullet sponges. More than half the time you can't tell what you are shooting at or if you are dealing any damage. The graphics are passable for something that looks like out of the n64 or ps1 era. The gameplay is very repetitive. I remember this game being 60fps. With the recent update this game got, the frame rate looks like it dipped into the 12 to 15 range. I'm playing this on a computer that is well above handling this sort of game. From what I read from other reviews is that this game is unplyable on anything above Windows 7. Now I'm playing this on a Windows 7 operating system, it's playable to a point. I can't even imagine how bad this game looks like on a Win 8 or 10 PC. Avoid this game. It's a 4/10 for me."

'Lacks common and main core features such as Co-Op.'Just a heads up before you read the pros and cons; I am rating this game as a ""Finished and published product"" which it does not feel like. Perhaps the game will change over time, but for now I do not recommend this game. I literally purchased half a dozen copies in hopes people in my gaming community could play together, since this game was not in Beta or anything.. Thinking Co-Op would work. It does not; Repeat CO-OP DOES NOT WORK.Pros:+ Good variety of weapons.+ Familiar style game and mechanics.+ Has a lot of potential, and ""Possible"" features.+ Somewhat comical and cartoony outbreak storyline.Cons:- Lacks a tutorial (Not everyone is an expert Zombie Survivor).- Needs to bring something to the table (Nothing unique here, except the comical feel.. Wait other games got that too).- Repetitive gameplay (Gets quite boring if you're gaming alone, new zombies do excite however)- Feels like a grind - A not good one either, after the first runs of each 'Scene' funds become scarce.- Lacking sound effects, or not notable ones (That just draw you in).- No custom settings - Such as changing Keybinds, user interface, and other common options elsewhere.- Co-op isn't working.The game definately has potential- it's hard to recommend it due to the simple fact that there are similar games which are better; and the fact that it's a comical feel/cartoony game it's supposed to be for a laugh, yet it lacks that for the simple fact you cannot enjoy it with friends (Co-Op). I get it, it's an indie game and it's decently priced; yet that's no excuse for putting out a product that feels like it's in alpha, or closed beta. Despite all of this, consider this game down the road, it shows appeal and ideals that can forge this game into something fun and for everyone. Hopefully the developers will continue to refine and polish this game, and soon; I can't wait to see what it turns out to be."

,Not Recommended,264300,18860175,"Posted: 3 November, 2015",all,KipofMudd,"I'm actually going to expand on my initial thoughts a small amount after playing some more. The game is really bland and just not really a well put together twin stick shooter to be honest. It's so damn generic you'll find every aspect of it in multiple other games. If you buy this at the $10 asking price, you wasted your money unfortunately.The graphics are mediocre and not particularly memorable, which usually helps a twin stick to stick out. The gameplay is standard twinstick with an ability your character gets to have and then on some levels you can build turrents, which don't seem to do much and only can go in certain spots on the map. I more or less ignored the story because it seemed really boring and generic as well. Some of the enemies do absolutely nothing and some of them knock you on your back and continue to do that, which rapidly drains your health and is quiet annoying to say the least.Just seems like not that much effort was put into this game to be honest. I also apologize for my previous review where I only played 30 miinutes and said it was an acceptable buy. Even with only 115 minutes or whatever I have now, I strongly recommend only picking this game up on sale and not to expect to much from it.3/10 Generic Game is GenericInitial:This is a fine twin stick shooter. It's not phenomenal and it's not bad. I'd say it's average. I got it on sell for a buck and I think that was an overly good deal for me. I would say this game is worth up to about $3 but not the full asking price.Don't expect a revolutionary experience. 6/10"

The gameplay is fun and frantic as you blast your way through hordes of the undead and each mission offers a diffrent set of objectives to complete.

After the first three levels i was bored and felt annoyed with the obstacle they make you run around to avoid the endless waves of zombie.After seeing the amount of equipment to purchase and upgrade I knew this was just going to be a big grindfest. Thats their gimmick repeat the level in a harder difficulty to upgrade or buy better equipment to progress. Nobody playing online as well.

The price that it costs because of the sale make s it easily comparable to a top down you would get in the apple or android store for a dollar, but this is on your PC and the graphics could hardly be better. So far it is pretty easy, but there are plenty of achievements to work towards. I personally dont think it matters how fun or how short it is for the price its at. Try it, you might love it as much as I do."

76561198057951925,Recommended,264300,17246288,"Posted: 26 July, 2015",all,PushpopRVT,"Like stated in other reviews... it's not particularly groundbreaking nor is the gameplay even close to mediocre at all. If anything you can call it mediocre once they get to the point where they can patch in something that registers hits with your bullets onto the zombies. It's overwhelmingly bad at that, but in everything else it does what it's supposed to. I feel as though it's not that optimized either given my computer had some issues with framerate stabilizing. I ran this on high with everything maxed, but I kept dropping from 90fps to 50fps randomly and it surprises even me on my build. However, the game is on sale as I write this and for 79 cents... I think it's at least worth a try if you like top down zombie survival shooters.  For the price... it's grand. As a game... holy cow it sucks."

Variety in enemies, maps and weapons and the character development system kept me interested till the end. It's not revolutionary but does what it tries to very well."
