The backgrounds are great, the character art's cute and engaging, the voice acting's better than I expected and the puzzles and gameplay are pretty good. There's a few minor hiccups like items the character won't take until she knows she need it (I hate that!) and one or two complex puzzles that seem to get slightly buggy if you don't do things in precise order. Overall though, these flaws were very minor and don't detract from the gameplay. There are also a few minigames just for variety, but nothing anybody will find overly taxing. These can be skipped if so desired.This game is a modern point-and-click adventure game. That means relatively limited interface options and relatively few interactable items per screen. This is a fairly good example of the genre, but if you're not a fan of point-and-click adventure, this won't be the game to change your mind."

You just have to overcome the first chapter, after that the game is getting better and better. Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle is a classic point and click adventure game. The story isn't that good but still adventurous. The backgrounds and the characters are very beautiful. I played the english version and I gotta say I really liked the dialogues and the voice acting. Especially Morganes spanish accent. There are lots of references to the modern pop culture during the entire game. I had some funny moments. In my opinion, the game is a little too childish sometimes. Be aware of that. I think I don't have to tell anything detailed about the story. It's already written in the game description.pros and cons:pros:- beautiful locations/backgrounds- cute characters- voice acting (Important: This refers to the english version! The german voice acting on theother hand is one of the worst synchronization I've ever heard)- low price!- funny references to other games, movies and books (Battlestar Galactica, Steve Jobs, soBlonde...)- not the best but still an entertaining story (I mean after chapter 1)cons:- tiring beginning (especially chapter 1)- rather easy puzzles- you have to click left mouse button after each dialogue line to continue the dialogueAfter all, Captain Morgane is not such a bad game. If You like point and click adventures, I would recommend it.I've really enjoyed it.    7/10"

Even though the artwork is fantastic, which has gotten me through several hours, this gameplay is wretched. You may have already read about the fact that you must click after ever single sentence just to get the next sentence or action to take place. I can almost handle that. The puzzles are uninteresting, but when you complete one and talk to a character about it, they still try to give you clues about that same puzzle. Add the fact that the navigation is slow and the writers obviously think they're hilarious and you have yourself a meh experience so much so that I need a really long run-on sentence to describe it.Go find another point & click adventure."

No scene is the same or resembles any other scene in the game.+Music that fits the game perfectly and doesn’t try to sound overpowering.+Fully voiced dialogue – well rehearsed and done nicely by the cast who did the voices.+No Crashes and/or Bugs that I am aware of.+Pirates, treasure, and an adventure!Cons:-No options in the menu. All you can do is change the voice dialogue and text of the language to English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish.-Resolution did not match that of my native resolution (had black bars on both sides of the actual gameplay, but the screenshots show in full resolution).-The animation of the actual characters on the screen could have used a lot more polish. I would say some of the characters would compare well with some PlayStation 2 characters.This is my first Point and Click adventure game. It was a fun little game and it was enjoyable. The puzzles and combination of items weren’t difficult even though at times there were some tricky ones. The game had some flaws, but nothing game breaking. I didn’t experience any bugs, crashes, or anything of similar nature.The story was decent and it introduced some funny, wacky characters along your adventures. The cast did a nice job on voice acting and from what I’ve read and heard on the forums, the original voices were replaced with new voices that matched the actual characters (hearing the first video to the third video on the actual store page is a HUGE difference – big plus on my end!). There are some nice jokes and a few Easter Eggs within the text.The theme of the game is around the Caribbean Sea. You’re a young pirate woman who wants to prove to everyone that you can be the next best pirate captain. You have a lot of obstacles and convincing of others in order to make this dream happen. You’ll encounter rivals and haters who will want to end your dreams. There are some moments where the female protagonist has to help others out on their own personal agenda in order to progress further on her own adventure (this gives a bit more background story on those individual characters that help you along your journey).As long as you have an open mind, don’t hate pirates, know that this isn’t a RPG; like treasures and an adventure – I would recommend this game to anyone who likes point and click games. I did enjoy this game and would give a 7/10."

,Not Recommended,264320,9218923,"Posted: 22 February, 2014",all,Turial,"No way, even if this was free I would return it. Dull characters, increasingly annoying voice actors (when you think you heard the worst they introduce you to someone that kills your ears even more) mostly illogical puzzles, the writing was awful and I could not tell if there was translation issues or if they were just trying to be funny. One of the biggest mysteries in the game turns out to be just a long drawn-out and crap pun that you hear near the end of the game. This kind of adventure might appeal for ""baby's first point & click"" but if you are over the age of 5 then this will just drain your intelligence. Avoid."

As her father gives her command of the ship for her birthday, Morgane accepts a charter to seek out the legendary Golden Turtle by following a trail of clues the famous explorer Buckleberry Tanner left behind him.Pros: The point & click genre is well represented as you pick up a whole assortment of objects and trinkets on your adventure, using them and combining them in creative and often funny ways to progress in the story. You come across a couple of strange or wacky characters on your adventure, and there's a few out-of-place reference to other games and movies in a hit-and-miss attempt to mimic the humor found in golden age Sierra and LucasArts games. The voice acting is ok, at least for the most part, and backgrounds look like the caricatural hand drawn style you'd expect. The story is child-friendly, and you must keep in mind that it's likely the target audience of the game as there is little to no jokes, not even subtle ones, targeted at a more mature audience.Cons: The characters' 3D sprites clash strongly with the 2D cartoony background, and I'm not convinced it was the best choice. The story is short, and the puzzles aren't enough to make it the lengthy experience aMonkey IslandorSpace Questgame would be. Some jokes are corny even for children, I wouldn't even expect any giggle from a younger player.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youI'll recommend this for younger players looking for slightly challenging puzzles, but adults will find it easy and perhaps even a bit of a boring tale. It doesn't quite reach the levels of other point & click, but although I'm not the player this game is for, it still gets an ""ok"" from me.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)reviews."

Who would have thought that a classic-style adventure game set in the Caribbean, a game in which you play as a strong-willed girl who wants to live up to the legacy of her long-lost pirate father, a game in which you hunt for treasure and captain a crew of ragged misfits, could turn out to be so profoundly, mind-bendingly DULL? The characters wind up being unengaging, the narrative drags and drags and drags, and the mechanics are awkward at best. I only spent $6 on this and if I could I'd demand my money back."

The game lacks complexity, and other than a few points where the object interactions were rather poorly implemented the game did not provide much in the way of a challenge. While this game might not be a good pick for the experienced adventure game player it is probably a good place to start for someone new to the genre.I was mostly unimpressed with the design of the puzzles, and to me the game barely scratches by a recommended mostly thanks to some funny dialogue, beautifully drawn graphics, and a mildly entertaining story.TL;DR - Ok game, worth picking up on a sale, or if you are someone who is new to the genre."

The puzzles are nice, but if they prove too much or puzzles aren't your thing you can skip them. You hit the ""Cheat"" button and the game solves the puzzles for you. This is truly an adventure game, which thrilled me. So many point-and-click games today are actually hidden object games with limited or no actual adventuring. In this game you can travel back and forth between several islands on your own pirate ship! How cool is that! This is the best money I have spent on a game in a long time. I'm so glad I got it."

It took me about 18 hours, so those people who claim to have finished this in 6 hours can only have used walkthroughs.There are 10 chapters and each chapter progresses the story very nicely.What I loved about this title was the dialogue, which was funny and made perfect sense. The voices of the many characters were all really well done and very much added to the atmosphere. Some of the characters are particularly brilliant, such as the debonnaire but daft Briscoe, the fabulous Buck who reminded me of so many people I've met in SE Asia (the developers really nailed that character), Sonia is the most hilarious and cagey dock side 'worker' ever, and of course the lead character, Morgaine, is a superb act. There are many more great and wacky characters that will be encountered that really do a great job.The story is very interesting and really gets going in chapter 2. I have seen reviews criticising chapter 1, but it's a cute, short introductory chapter and great for story background. and takes about 45 minutes to playthrough. The ultimate quest, introduced by the eccentric English gentleman, Briscoe, is always the aim, though the journey there will take many twists and turns with lots of side quests.I don't want to give away any of the plot, but I'll just say that the way the story dealt with a sad death was very touching indeed and one of the peaks of the title.The graphics are bright and colourful and their cartoony style do the story lots of justice. Well done to the graphics team.The puzzles are mostly fetch quests, dialogue threads and inventory matching. While these are mostly fun and do require thought and LOTS of experimentation, it would have been nice to have thrown in some other types of puzzles too. The few mini game type puzzles are on the weak side,I liked the control system of clicking the dialogue to move it on as that way I didn't miss any important information and it allowed me to read it while listening, at my own speed. A good system. The inventory, as mentioned above, does require a lot of trial and error, but is perfectly fine.So, overall, I really enjoyed this game, though I was not sure I would before I started playing it. I would strongly recommend it for  15 plus very entertaining hours (if played with no hints)."

Puzzles are mostly easy and you don't get any satisfaction after doing it. 3D animations used very badly.  It takes so much time to go from one place to another and they did it purposely just for more playtime. After every dialogue you have to click to pass and they used unnecessarily 3d animation and you have to wait it finish. Everything is made for only you can't play it smoothly and spend more time in game. The only beautiful thing about this game is backgrounds which is very nice.
