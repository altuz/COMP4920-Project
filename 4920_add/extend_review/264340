So, my Steam stats don't reflect my actual play time with Major Mayhem.PROS:+ FUN!+ Easy to pick up, difficult to master.+ Tons of unlockables.+ Cheap at only $5 (USD). FREE for iOS, Android, Windows phones, and Kindle Fire.+ LOW hardware requirements.+ Cross-platform; Windows/Mac/Linux compatible.+ Fun graphics are easy on the eyes and not intimidating to casual players.CONS:- No online multiplayer, yet.- ""Hardcore"" gamers may be put off by Major Mayhem's 'accessibility'."

There are 45 missions to complete, Survival modes, Cool weapons, Armory and much more. Earn the ultimate 3 star rating on each mission. The only draw-back is there is no co-op/multiplayer. Gold star rating."

The intricate pretext: The world is in total mayhem and they got your girl.This sidesrolling railshooter combines simplistic gameplay with some weapon progression and tongue in cheek character customization. Lots of references and recognizable outfits, a fun setting and a clean style.Obivously this was made for mobile devices so it has some of those made for touchscreen elements like the huge onscreen pause button.When advancing in level your character can spin the reward wheel and unlocks gear and stuff in the armory. Some of these have certain level requirements so it keeps you going til u get that new shotgun or whatever.Absolute no brainer, cute style and low price... count me in!"
76561197996449785,Recommended,264340,9282522,"Posted: 27 February, 2014",all,oldzoom,"This indie arcade third person shooter is a blast to play.The game has over 5,000,000+ downloads on the Google Play Store and having a rating of 4.8 and with that many downloads tells you this game is worth a serious look...I have it on Android for my phone and tablet, it's one of my favorites, so buying it to play on my PC and laptop was an easy decision to make.If you have an Android phone or tablet try this game out on the Google Play Store and see it for yourself (it's free), then imagine using a mouse to target all the bad guys. Your mouse is the Aim, button 1 is shoot, button 2 is jump and #1 thru #4 are the extra weapons. You can also change the control configuration to what you like. The resolution is adjustable to your monitors resolution, it will full screen or window mode too.With my experience with this game on Android, using a mouse for the aim made the game a whole lot more enjoyable on the PC and less frustrating in heavy combat fighting.It's on sell right now for $1 off 20% - $3.99, but the regular price of $4.99 is a bargin for the amount of replay value this little game offers. There's 100 achievements to obtain in the game with 45 levels, so you're not going to play it just once.You earn coins in the game by killing enemies and completing tasks, you use the coins to buy Supplies, missles, armour, slow time, super bullets and unlock levels. You can also buy various outfits for the Major to wear in the game. Different weapons (guns) are earned by ranking up through game play. So you're going to be playing this game quite a few times to earn enough coins to be able to purchase all the items in the game.It's a great time killer when you don't have the time to get involved in regular size games, jump right in and play a few missions till it's time to do what you're waiting to do. We all need a game to kill time with and this is one of the best I've ever played to kill time with. Although it is hard to stop playing once you've started because it is that good.Don't miss out on Major Mayhem it's a great little shooter with alot of replay value and it's a great bargin for what you get, 45 levels of nonstop third person shooter fun with 100 achievements..."

,Recommended,264340,9254291,"Posted: 24 February, 2014",all,Dr. Fortyseven,"If you haven't yet played 'Major Mayhem' on your favorite portable entertainment square, you've been missing out on one of the most enjoyable run & gun, twitchy arcade shooters around.  Wave after wave of stereotypes descend on you as you pick them off with one of multitude of firearms ranging from pistols, to sniper rifles, to bazookas.It's a very simple game on the surface, but it mixes things up enough between each wave to keep it prepetually entertaining.The touch screen controls of this mobile port have translated quite well to a mouse cursor interface.  Additonally, there's been a transition from the entirely optional in-app-purchases on mobile to a tiered unlock as you progress.We don't see a lot of well-done arcade action like this nowadays.  Can't recommend this one enough."

,Recommended,264340,14746253,"Posted: 5 March, 2015",all,SpinozasHammer,A quick picker-upper that is perfect for a fast round of shooting ninjas and bright colors. It's the same Time Crisis mechanics that I love in a well styled format. I'd really recommend this to anybody for a super fun game you can play on a Pomodoro timer break between tasks and it succeeds splendidly at that niche.

You can have some simple run and gun action for 10-20 minute break periods, or take the time and be meticulous with the challenges to squeeze those extra couple 0f points out of a level for another medal. Your choice."

This game haves a descent content and is cheap . I know that the mobile version is free but this version has no microtransactions. To be a game like Time Crisis and Metal Slug this is a great combination.
