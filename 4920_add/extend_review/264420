,Recommended,264420,9209789,"Posted: 21 February, 2014",all,Grey,"I was a bit unsure if I should buy it or not when I first saw this program. I couldn't find a single review or opinion on the internet or user review in here, but after reading the Community Hub I decided to give it a try, and here what I think about it:Pros:- Weight: It's quite a lightweight program, so older computers can run it.- Perspective tool: It helps a LOT when working on sceneries. You can use up to 3 vanishing points, and it's easy to adjust the angle.- Pose Tool: I was really curious about it, specially since it's something I always missed in other drawing programs and how it would work with angles and perspective, and it work quite nicely.- Panels: They may feel a bit odd at first, but they really help a lot. You draw inside them, and then you can position and adjust them in your comic.- The Developers: Not only they've been helping newbies to the program, giving tips and instructions and making guides on how to use it, they also been listening to the users.- Price: A good program for a fair price, what not like about it?Contras:- The UI: It can be a bit hard to understand on how to use for begginers, but it's not hard once you learn on how to use it (which for me didn't take long, around three to five minutes poking around the program).- Lack of Guides and Tutorials: It's a fairly new program so, which means it's hard to find tutorials and guides on the internet, but as I said earlier, the developers have been of great help with guides and answering users questions.- Tablet - It's highly recommended to have a graphic tablet to use the program, and sadly not everyone have or can afford one.So yeah, I do recommend this program."
,Recommended,264420,10020289,"Posted: 4 May, 2014",all,FireCatWithFire,"Great program. I went over to this from PaintTool SAI and it really wasn't that difficult to figure out how the tools or UI worked. This isn't the best beginner program, but it has everything you need to start. For someone who is working on a web comic or illustration, this program has a lot of very powerful and easy to use tools, in addition to a decent variet of basics.Pros:Excellent, fully adjustable perspectives toolCharacter poser! Lets you adjust and move a skeleton for characters.Rulers! Adjustable straight lines, curved lines and circles.Customizable brushesCons:Feels a little clunky compared to SAI.Smoothing on the cursor/pen is responsive at 0, but when you draw curves they come out blocky. At max, it feels like your pen is lagging.Very limited ""undo"" amount.Over all, I feel like it's a great program."

Once you start it up there are pretty much no tutorials, so you need to figure out a lot for yourself or ask around.That being said, although I wouldn't recommend this as a high end art program or a substitute for one, it works QUITE well for its intended purpose. It has a lot of interesting tools, and it has enough going for it to satisfy any comic or manga artist. And worse case scenario if it doesn't suit your needs, there's no reason you can't start each page on this program then add finishing touches with a more advanced one if you have it.In summation, this isn't photoshop. Not even close. But it will definitely take a few headaches out of the comic and panel making process. I recommend it to anyone who wants to make a comic or web comic but don't want to shell out 100 dollars or more for the means to do so. Having a graphics tablet would definitely help, but of course that's provided you can afford one in the first place."

But it's got it where it counts.  It feels great.  The stroke smoothing is great.  Pressure sensitivity with my Wacom Bamboo tablet is excellent.  If you are looking for an inking program, you could spend more and find one with a more robust set of tools, but if all you are interested in is inking, this is a great price.It also does some nice airbrush and colouring but I haven't used it for that yet.Bottom line is: I'm very glad I got this.. Esp. for 50% off during the holiday sale. :)  Haven't stopped using it."

Yes, it has plenty of issues; it lags intensly when using spline layers and etc... even on my High end pc.... and yes it is super simple and seemingly basic... but it is incredibly intuitive... the spline tool, the line blocking and the perspective tool as well as others really revolutionize comicbook designing software. This program is truely developed for comic book artists... in all of the best ways... as far as those artists who are looking for something extremely tool heavy and photoshop-esk this might be waaaay to limited for you... but if you aregoing into professional comicbook creation... you will feel right at home as well as transitioned properly into the future with the layers and line toools provided.I love this program!~Mike.M"

My first impression was some rage quitting, but after trying out some of the sparse tutorials I just got blown away At least with the perspective guides, you can with ease set up a frame, with serverel  view points, and there are help tools which making ovals and circles way easier to do, you can use help lines, so making a thing like an arch much easier to do. There even is a tool for helping you place any humanoid and even animals.If you want to draw using perspective do not fink twice about buying this. A buddy of mine tried to get on the Corel Painter, which he claimed was the best he ever used, showed him Comicado which he had to admit had way more  tools for perspective drawing. If there ever comes and update, with better brushes and better color handeling, this easially actually could be a contender on not just comic making, but but graphic apps."

76561198053438603,Recommended,264420,23791844,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,southpawami,"It's basicallyminimalismfor comics.  The kind you want when you are experienced enough to know what you want to put down, and have redrawn enough references that for your project you don't need many.  Even the ball and line person representation for a human reference is beautifully minimalistic.Before, I used to compare this to Clip Studio or MangaLabo.  But honestly, it's not a fair comparison.  The software includes the essentials for that comic that has all the characters you already know because you've sketched them several times.  The  perspective tools and custom panel tools are there too.  If you're working on something you're not familiar with, ArtRage has great reference options after the developer fixed what I told them I couldn't do.  MangaLabo has an amazingly quick geometry 3D planning for rooms.  Clip Studio has many tools to help out anyone who doesn't know what they want to draw and a lot of tools for painting.At the end of the day, if you know what tools you need and you don't overburden yourself with all the tools you don't, you're making the best decision for your comic.  So be honest with yourself, with your level and your degree of knowledge of scenes and characters.  If you're clueless on the scenes, but know your characters, Mangalabo might be the right tool. If you're a bit clueless on everything or plan to paint a lot, Clip Studio might be the right tool.  If you know your characters and your scenes... you go back and forth between sketching and writing your idea to clearly develop it, simply sketch through, then Comicado might be the right tool."
,Recommended,264420,13254231,"Posted: 6 December, 2014",all,DFX2KX,"So... You want to draw pictures, or more specifically, a comic.Well, this software is built around this particular use case. It can also do illistrations, but it's not built around that use case quite as much as it is comics.You have the vitual 'paper' of the page to be drawn. You don't draw directly on this, like in MS paint. You have panels. For an illistration, a panel can be the entire page. When you're making a comic, you'll have more then one, and you can easily resize and move them around  a bit after drawing them. It also allows you to distort the whole panel if you want. There's lots of options there. Inside these panels, you have your standard layers, like in everything that's not MS paint.It will take mouse input, so you don't need to buy a $100 tablet (or $250 tablet-equipped laptop) but if you have one, that also works. It has drawing guides, like French Curves for us Drafting people, that let you draw smoothly with either method.Pros:It's cheap, Buy it once and you're doneHas some tools very useful for it's inteded application.has figures you can pose to get a sense of scale, this is REALLY nice if you're like me and utterly stink at drawing characters.Has nice export functions, and some limited vector graphics capibility (it's a raster program, so no exporting)Doesn't chew up too much memory, while you're running.A fair decent selection of  brushes and the like.Has guides, even mouse drawn stuff can look good.Perspective grid <3 so much less involved for basic outlining of that sort of scene.Cons:The pressure sensitivity for tablets isn't there (at least on the t730 it's not) it also doens't change the cursor to tell you it's getting it's cues from the pen, it's nice for me to have that visual feedback so I know when I can let my palm rest.Editing spines is TEDIOUS. Avoid using them when you can.The toolbars on the sides don't stay inside the window, so it can cover the start bar or end up half offscreen when I rotate the tablet..It lacks a classical 'ruler' with mm/pixels/inch measurement, it IS nice to have that now and again. Not so much a con as a feature I miss dearly.Could use more figures. A hand is one example I'd love to see added. I tied to add one myself (You can do that!) but it failed miserably.It could use some tutorials, but I know those are slowly coming.Lacks a plugin API that I know about (if it has one, I can think of at least one handy plugin to add, I'd make it myself if need be)All in all, it's not a bad program. I've doodled with it quite a bit, using both the tablet on the laptop, and the desktop, and have yet to have gotten really annoyed at anything. I've gotten faster with it as time goes on. Would (and have) reccommeded it to other artists I know"

76561197970179466,Recommended,264420,20099257,"Posted: 29 December, 2015",all,Dodge_This,"First Impression:Lack of tutorials which many have mentioned. I am not sure why the developer did not promote his tutorial on the front page which gets you started with most of the stuff.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=215951642Why you would not buy this software?1- If you are not good at drawing this will not improve on any of that. Develop your drawing skills first. Even with the pose options you will not be able to draw good if you are not familiar with the anatomy of the drawing.So if you are buying this software thinking your comics are going to look any better most likely they wont.2-If you don't like to explore the software yourself stay away from it most of the help you will be scavenging through the discussions. If you are the type of person who posts a thread the minute you get stuck with something - this software is not for you.3- Everything has its own layer - text , poses, everything - its not photoshop - once you get past the whole everything in its own layer you should be able to move through the whole drawing process relatively faster.Though this software seems complete I hope the developer listens to the users and fixes several misplaced menu options. Pose creation does not have pose delete or rename - you have to go through the preset manager.Also the smoothing option is wonky you will have to play around till you find the sweet spot - which might not exactly be what you need.All said and done - for the discounted price I can recommend it. Its not Manga studio but than for the discounted price its worth it - which I recommend the developer to reduce to that permanently.I highly recommend checking out the guides posted by the developer - they will answer most of your questions.The lack of proper pictorial manual is simply unacceptable - seems like the dev is highly dependent on having the user already used and being familiar with other photo / illustrative tools.Also if you plan to draw with a mouse - please don't buy this software.Link to tutorial:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=215951642"

After that, any time I tried to open it, my border would turn green, then blue again. I hav uninstalled and reinstalled Steam three times already, all with no avail. I don't know if this is Steam or a file, or whatever, but it's not at all worth it.As an alternative, I recommend Paint Tool SAI, even though it is a little pricey at nearly $60, but it never shuts down, and it seems to be the best image painting tool so far. Better than Fire Alpacam, better than this, and possibly better than Photoshop. So go get that instead.If anyone can be able to help me get Comicado to work again so I can give this product another chance (and therefore a fair review), it would be greatly appreciated."
