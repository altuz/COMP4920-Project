,Recommended,264540,9658424,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,Kurosawa-Fan,"Do you like loot + platforming + randomised levels? Look no further. With elements of Steamworld Dig (randomised mines, collect minerals of ever-increasing value the deeper you go, locate portals for quick returns in trickier parts of the map) this offers plenty of replayability, even though the shooting and platforming elements start to get a little repetitive over what seems to be a single enormous level. Similar to the level creation in Cargo Commander, you give your new level a name and the game randomises it based on that name...somehow.The deeper you go into the mines, the more chance you have of scoring better guns, although the loot system is a little disappointing. There aren't randomised gun effects, only % stats (higher damage, firing rate, etc) and there are precious few different hats you can wear to give you extra stuff, like 2 additional jumps (yes, you can jump 5, 6 or even 7 times in the air).Jumping feels a little floaty, and your gun has the annoying tendancy to point upwards when you're jumping up to a higher platform, meaning you inadvertently fire vertically rather than horizontally like you were expecting. However once you get used to how your character moves, you'll be zipping around levels in no time (an XBox 360 controller is recommended).Your character can only see a limited distance around him/her, and when you get damaged this cone of vision starts to shrink, meaning you can get into some really nasty spots with extremely limited vision - you may find this a welcome addition or an annoyance.Still, those quibbles aside, Platformines offers a ton of platforming content and that addictive, often elusive ""just one more play until I get to the next portal/find a better gun/grab that sparkly bit of ore over there"" feel. Here's hoping the developers add more randomised loot and abilities in a future patch. There's certainly no reason to try the demo first and see if you like it."

The equipment doesn't scale with the enemies, and so the game goes from a really cool Borderlands-lite experience early on, to a mindless and repetitive grind between recharging trips back home later on.A lot of promise, but poor execution from this console port.5/10"

So let's just shoot the story and go for a little platforming and shooting and loot collecting... in a mine!Platformines is a nice package indeed, combining features from several genres to create a fun game that does nothing really new but still feels fresh.You start by creating a male or female character from a couple of visual options, and are then brought into a randomly generated mine (where your ship, the Robodog, totally crashed). Your job is to explore the mine and relocate several building blocks to restore the ship- and to do so you need to fight masses of enemies, collect coins and loot, upgrade your equipment and be an all-round badass.You also get to listen to a chiptune rendition of ""Hall of the Mountain King.""Platforming is nice and precise even with a keyboard, though a pad is clearly better. From the get-go you have quintuple jumps, and there is almost no momentum, so you'll quickly put Mario to shame by staying airborne and shooting things easily. Vanity items you collect can give you even more jumps and also change armour rating, weapon damage, and other attributes.Shooting feels old-school and satisfying. You can equip up to four weapons (pistol, shotgun, machine gun and launcher) and just like the Borderlands games every weapon is procedurally generated, so you'll often find something surprising. There's no ammo limit either; while weapons have magazines and reload times you always have ""infinite bullets"".And there's more equipment, most notably energy belts that increase the amount of damage you can take but also larger backpacks: You'll collect gems on your way to sell in your homebase OR, and this is interesting, to replenish your shield belts. Do you dare to try and secure that teleporter over there and chash in on the gems, or would you rather play it save and spend them to make it further down the mine?All in all, this really feels like an over the top ""roguelike"" without permadeath. Your home base is a safe haven where you can store loot, shop a little, and save your progess. The mine is constantly repopulated with enemies so if you need to grind for money you'll soon have some ""easy places"" to get some cash. It's NOT a metroidvania game- from the get-go you're able to explore as you see fit, only limited by your firepower and skill.And is it fun? That's the most important question after all! And yes, it is. It's a fun little platform shooter with charming retro graphics and a lot of replayability. It's not OUTSTANDING and it doesn't really do anything new, but it's a nice mix of genres that'll keep fans of simple arcade games entertained for a good while!"

This game is fantastic.  It's like a little Borderlands and the maps are HUGE.  Tons of gameplay here for $10.At the moment of writing this the game does not properly support all TV resolutions.  Get some overscan on my computer but not a big deal.  That's actually why I'm here writing a review; I had to restart the game to get it windowed.  Other than that I have no complaints.To sum this game up I would have to say, ""Borderlands.  Steamworld Dig.  Contra.  Terraria."""
,Recommended,264540,9866788,"Posted: 18 April, 2014",all,VALIS,"Platformines has been one of my bigger surprises of 2014 so far. Launching in late March without much, or really close to any fanfare, I decided to install it one rainy Saturday afternoon and it was like finding a box of brightly colored toys in a dusty, spidery attic. A lot of the gameplay elements here are very familiar -- precision platforming, gobs of randomized loot, a never-ending cycle of weapon upgrades -- but it feels fresh, these elements were never combined in quite this way before.It reminds me most of the lauded roguelike platformer Spelunky, except where Spelunky is all about survival, Platformines is more about exploration and aggression. There is a very large overworld to explore, and the further you move away from your base in the middle(ish) of the map in any direction, the more difficult the enemies are, enemies you can eliminate with one of four different types of gun. After finishing the game on the default difficultly level (5-6 hours) I uncovered about 25% of the map, so there's a lot of map here to explore if you're willing. There's also a fun, punk-pixel sense of style from outlandish costumes and hair-dos to five-eyed blob monsters to platforms filled with whirring blades of bloody death.On the downside, the game is a tad on the short side, but for the price and the type of game, I'm really not sure a 10-20 hour epic would have worked. I would have liked to have seen more enemy and area variety, plus a better reward for finishing the game rather than ""the same thing, only harder,"" but I certainly don't feel cheated in any way. This was a great little game from out of left field, and I'm going to be keeping an eye on Magiko to see what they come up with in the future."

However, its simplicity scratches an itch that most other games can't because they get too complex.  It is fun trying to uncover the map, and trying to navigate through the maze to reach your goal.  It has straight forward action platforming mechanics that are entertaining.There are drawbacks.  It can get repetitive, especially when you just want to reach your goal and you keep hitting dead ends or getting hit by the large bazooka blast radii and traps in small corridors, but if you enjoy action platformers, I would recommend it."

The difficulty does not scale very well as it jumps from feasible to a loop of deaths.

The soundtrack in this game is so awesome to play to, most of it being crunchy chip tune remixes of classical music. It's a little random but I feel like it's perfect. The graphic style is also really well done. Sadly there isn't any crafting element in this game really. You would think with the blocky environments and ""biomes"" that it would be a building game but it isn'tThe main focus of the game is to explore procedurally generated mines for the tools needed to repair the Robodig and return to the surface. Depending on what seed you choose, you will have a different result from another player, or you can share a seed and have the same mine. The main base hub is always the same, and the mines expand radially from the that. The further you venture the more difficult it gets. Enemies and traps do more damage. The ""tiers"" or rings of mine are color coded to show which difficulty level you're in.The gameplay is pretty straightforward and fast paced for me, venture out a bit, defy gravity with quad jumps, collect gems and metals, find a teleport to return to base and sell them, and repeat. You'll take a ton of damage in later mine tiers but I found the Knight hat helped with damage reduction, and there's always a teleport nearby which will bring you back to base and recharge your shields. You can customize your character a tad in the beginning, and also find hats/wigs/weapons that add stats to your characer throughout.I'm not sure how much replay value I can say this game has after completing a map and exploring all the times. The story is minimal and barely present, but I really do enjoy the gameplay and presentation so far. Hoping to see bigger and better things from this dev in the future."

After a two runs through the game, I can't say there's much customisation. Most likely, you'll change your hat/wig three or four times per run, because there aren't many different hats, and some of them are way better than others, meaning once you've found them, you won't change anymore.The gameplay itself was good (I really liked the ""must get to next portal"" feeling, adds a bit of tension), but if you're searching for a game in which you FEEL yourself improving, I wouldn't recommend it. You have 4 gun types, only the stats change (maning you won't get ""the cool weapon that shoots firebeams"", which would be really nice though), hats don't change your play style that much (2 more jumps, a bit of armor maybe, nothing game breaking).Speaking of the gameplay, you have to get 9 items to repair your robot and finish the game. Actually, most of the time, you'll be rushing straight to those items, while searching for portals along the way, which you'll be using as ""checkpoints"", or to sell your items. Two possibilities : the key item is in an area with high-damage ennemies, in which case you'll get some money (by killing ennemies and finding gems, metals and chests) to upgrade your health bar and just tank through it, or it'll be in a ""low-level area"", in which case you'll tank through it right away.Ennemy variety was also meh, I counted 7 diffent ennemies (little flying monster, big flying monster, small splitting flying monster, big splitting flying monster, turret, human with randomized gear, flying worm), with some color or model changes (for exemple, bats and ""eyes"" are actually the same).If you're a leaderboard fan, and if you like playing the same game (with a mildly-randomized map) to improve your time, or your number of death, I'd say it's a great game.If, like me, you're a rogue-like/adventure fan, you'll play it once, maybe twice, and that's it. At least it kept me entertained for a few hours."

Something as simple as movement becomes imprecise and annoying because they force you to move with the analog stick rather than the d-pad. You shoot with the trigger rather than one of the a/b/x/y buttons, which (having grown up playing sidescrollers on the SNES and Genesis) feels incredibly awkward.And, of course, you can't remap the controls, because that would be silly. Nothing takes a game that looks fun and makes it suck quite like bad controls."

If your bagback(?) is full you return to your base (teleport gate), sell your stuff and go back, thats pretty much it. Of course there is a main quest: You must collect ""Block cannons"" to repair your *NO I DONT SPOILER HERE!* but anyhow that only gives you an ""direction"" where you COULD go next and nothing more...-I somehow miss a multiplayermode in this game, its really pretty (f*ckin) lonely in a random cave shooting random people and what not, srs.-Also, Who ever said ""its Borderlands in 2D"" never played Borderlands i guess: Platformines has not really any skillsystem (no skilltree or LVL up) also you dont collect EXP or like. the only thing which COULD come close to Borderlands is that it gives a lot of weapons...but anyhow, in this 2d Game, you dont really noice the differance of the guns in the same typ (it gives 4 types: Pistol, SMG, Shotgun, Rocket launcher)After so much ""bad things"" i can say really only some good things about...+The grafic fits to the style of the game+Its pretty easy to ""jump into the action"", means, its easy to play.+You play a VERY f*ckin big random cave and srs, it IS huge!So to be fair and fact: Platformines shows more as it really has, it could get pretty fast boring coz its everytime kinda the same: run into the cave - loot - back to base - sell - run into the cave. Also coz that the cave IS SUCH HUGE AND RANDOM i miss really someone on my side who helps me out or i could share the fun...It plays just ""unfinish""...it really feels like the creators missed something, srs.So for my opinion, BEST try FIRST the DEMO and make your OWN Fact about but i -CANT- say its a bad OR a good game.So i would give it a 3 out of 5 star voting."

,Not Recommended,264540,9655863,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,Losian Rooke,"At first glance, looks cute, about an hour in poking around.. It was a pain to setup the controller because, for whatever reason, ""controller support"" just means xbox. (have already beaten normal mode in < 3 hours, see edit towards end.)If you have a non xbox controller, then dig  your xpadder/joy2key or whatever else and fight with it.For heaven's sake, devs.. Why do you keep making controller supported games that DO NOT support simple basic Windows-recognized controller keymapping? Come on. :/After playing a bit, well.. You'll be disappointed by weapon variety. There's four, that's it. They're randomized, sure,  but unless you find the difference of 10 damage from one pistol to another to be ""unique"" and ""fun"" then you won't be amazed by that. There's also some gear, but all I've found so far are hats and wigs, which occupy the same 'slot,' and seem to only be slightly randomized. Most of this gear also seems to be stuff available at character creation, as well. You pick a hat/hair/etc., and I haven't really seen anything separate from what was available at creation, so there's no real excitement to loot or progression, except the randomized slow increase on weapon stats. Not at all interesting or fun.The AI on enemies also seems very basic.. They can see you through walls and will just shoot randomly while pacing back and forth. You also start to see repeats in the world organization pretty quickly, I'm already starting to recognize configurations of rooms and such. :(It's a cute game, but there's just not a heck of a lot of bulk to it, especially for $10 compared to others in that same range. Needs many more weapons, more effects and random properties, etc.As best I can tell there's a big randomized map, the game randomizes the location of some 'block guns' into locations that arbitrarily harder. There's no real metroidvania progression or anything to get from one to another, just pure stats - you'll be one shotted if you don't get better weapons and farm money for higher energy. You collect the guns, shoot some blocks near where you start, win; rinse repeat on higher difficulties. It has a good look overall, I just feel like this game needs more depth.. More varities and variations on weapons, not just four with slightly different attacks. Contra had more weapons!  The 'equipment' also seems pretty slim. Unless you really wanna pound out each difficulty for the arbitrary increase in difficulty you probably won't get but a handful of hours from it, and it rings in steep at $10 for other games with much mor depth and playtime.Edit: Well.. Less than three hours and I beat normal mode. No real incentive to play the harder difficulties, I imagine it's just the same but arbitrarily harder. :(I also understand the nature of input types and dealing with it, it's just frustrating to have to fiddle 3rd party programs just because my controller (which is all but a clone of an xbox contrller anyway, just nicer and with better battery life/bluetooth) doesn't jive with how they set it up. PC games are ideal for their flexibility- you don't have to have a specific keyboard or mouse or peripheral, and particularly considering it's fully recognized, buttons and axes and all, in Windows itself, a little support would be great from more games.As for PLatformines, well, if you have a total hard-on for leaderboards and intensely repetitive gameplay then more power to ya. It's a cute game - the music is all kinda cute but also just chip-tune-y remixes of well known songs (sugar plum fairies, stuff like that.) As I said above: There's four weapons, they do not get in any way more interesting, there's no randomness or random abilities or special effects except for their damage/reload times; they remain largely the same, just higher damage and some variation reload time and such. The only reason to even bother to kill enemies is to upgrade your belt (health) and perhaps get a better helmet (knight is good since you don't have to kill anything, just get the defense and run.) It's a cute game all in all, but it just feels beyond flat. Sorry devs, good effort, but I definitely feel like I just wasted $10 for a mere couple hours of fun."

,Recommended,264540,14505120,"Posted: 16 February, 2015",all,StanleyPain,"Platformines is one of those games where I wish there was more nuance to the rating system than just ""thumbs up or down.""  This game is more sort-of in the middle of the two.    The basic gameplay and mechanics are solid and everything fits together really well.  Basically, you are in a randomly generated underground mine.  You run around killing enemies and finding resources, increase your money, buy upgrades and keep repeating the process.  The goal is to find all the pieces of a special gun you need to rebuild your spaceship.  Once you find all the pieces, you then go into a kind of sub-game within the game where you have to put together the engine like a puzzle.   The game can be a bit random at times, but for the most part it works.  You get better weapons slowly and you find different hats that give small bonuses to certain things and make you look goofy.So far it's great, but the grey area that Platformines eventually wanders into concerns its length.   The worlds that are randomly generated are mind-bogglingly huge.  The scale doesn't truly hit you until you've picked up 4 or 5 engine pieces and at that point you might think ""Damn..I might never finish this.""   And therein lies the flaw....the game is simply too huge for the gameplay that supports it.  The difficulty also doesn't scale particularly well.  The further away from your base you get, the harder the world becomes, which makes sense.  But the only stat-based upgrade you can buy, your health upgrades, only go up to a certain point then mysteriously stop well before the game is even remotely close to being finished.   Better guns help a little bit with this, but the odds you will find random weapons that will vastly improve your survivability is a dice roll at best.   Don't get me wrong, this is a good, enjoyable game.  I just think it could really use an update where you can buy more upgrades and possibly have a better selection of hats that provide a greater variety of gameplay style options."

(At least) two things will frustrate you though.1) Not being able to hit the enemy you're right on top of - despite them being able to hit you.See example with 3 enemies on top of me.2) Splash damage on your bazooka. By end game if you hit anything remotely near you (or a wall) - you instantly blow up. Even with max shield. Enemies are immune to their own splash damage. See 1)That being said. Fun gameplay and loot. Not too challenging in normal mode.
