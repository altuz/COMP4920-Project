There is nothing wrong with point & click games, the stories are amazing, but I sometimes I miss the range of RPG games & this game gave it back to me.Quest for Infamy is the silliest game I've played in a while & the sarcasm reminds me so much of the point & click games of my childhood. You're going to love it."

Play it for the nostalgia alone."

It has a style and quality of old adventure games, but also the modern humor. Also it merger traditional point and click with RPG elements, some parts of the story have branches and different solutions. Very recommended to everyone who likes adventure games and RPG.Ah, how could I forget! All who hate traditional do-gooders and want at least sometimes to play a rude, cynical villain - start playing this right now!"

There is less frustration and I love the voice acting. Every bit of text is voice acted. Great game if you are a fan of the old school point and click RPG."

Seriously, when the game wants to creep you out, the music knows just what to do, so much so that I actually found myself glancing over my shoulder in my chair because the music just pushed my mind into a state of paranoia.I was also able to complete the majority of the game without looking for any hints, but there will always be walkthroughs/hints on the internet if you need them.If you remember Quest for Glory and games like it fondly, you'll get your money's worth here. :)"
,Recommended,264560,31064874,Posted: 10 April,all,seeashbashrun,"Love this throwback to 'Quest for Glory', one of my favorite games as a kid. It's got a lot of the great elements from the series (particularly my favorite 'so you want to be a hero?'). The story is fun and the gameplay solves a lot of the bugs from the Glory series. The additional character dev and scripting is a nice, slightly corny touch :). My main criticism is that the game lacks a lot of the depth/length for the genre. It's fun and has replay value, but there are not as many options and the track is a bit too fixed for my taste. I still enjoyed it and would recommend getting it on sale for a good time.Pros:-Nostalgia overload-Improvement on gameplay/visuals/audio of genre-Fun twist on the 'Glory' good-guy-Replay valueCons:-Limited branching/complexity-A bit short"

Certainly no hero, Roehm is a roguish fellow, although he's not a complete villain either.The game is quite huge in terms of places to visit and things to do.  The artwork for the game is well-drawn and it has an entertaining story with an interesting cast of characters.  It also offers a lot of replayability in that one can pick from a Thief, Brigand or Sorcerer.  While Thieves can sneak into houses the Brigands can engage in caravan attack missions and Mages can collect spell components and learn new spells.  More than just changes to the combat system, each class has its own unique storylines and its own way of dealing with problems.  For instance, while a thief may sneak past 3 unruly hunters using the thief tunnels the Brigand can simply fight them off while the Mage can cast a fear spell that sends them running in terror.  Each class has unique missions to accomplish and can befriend different casts of characters to learn more about the world around them and those who populate it.The game's story itself is quite good and has a very dark, gothic style to it as well as mischievous and perverted sense of humor.  The game functions well as a loving tribute/parody to Quest for glory and the adventure/fantasy genre in general.  Longtime Sierra fans of olde will appreciate many of the Easter Eggs hidden throughout the game thought it's completely unnecessary to be an oldschool Sieera fan to enjoy the game in general.  The game also features very good voice-acting and narration to accompany the story.There are some complex puzzles to the game that can be quite tricky and confusing though, but it's well worth the effort to make your way past them and find out what happens next.  The focus of the game is much more on adventuring and solving puzzles and soaking in the fun than on combat, so pure-adrenaline junkies should probably stick to Skyrim.  If you're easily offended and want something more PG you should probably stick with Quest for Glory instead.Overall I'd give it a 9/10 and I do hope it has a sequel someday. :)"

If you've ever played Quest for Glory or Kings Quest, you'll feel right at home with the gameplay. The fact that your character this time around is a rogue, rather than your typical do-gooder hero, adds a lot of flavor to the game and the dialogue had me laughing all the way through. The game also offers a little bit of replay value, which is unusual for the genre, by letting you play through as 3 different classes. The only real flaws the game has are that it can be a little buggy at time, although the devs seem to be pretty good about addressing there, and there tends to be a lot of clutter in your inventory, which is a small peeve of mine in this kind of game. These problems, however, are pretty small in the long run and I would not hesitate to reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys old-school point n clicks."

I've just finished as the rouge class and I have to say that based on the ending, that I HOPE THERE is a sequel! It seems like theres a lot more game that they could create and hopefully with getting their bearings with the first game, can release a double stuffed sequel. If you're a fan of the old Sierra Adventure games then this game gives the olde skool style a modern lift. Voice acting is pretty good and feels solid most everywhere. FANS OF THE Ben Jordan/Grundaslav games check this out too, as I am certain that the art style of this game would appeal to your tastes.The Linux port is also much appreciated"

Unlike some other games, you feel you are part of the story in this one. The game is varied as well, with some fighting (which you can have as 'easy') but also puzzles to solve. Being able to play three different games (as three different characters) is also a plus as you certainly get value for money.Absolutely recommended!"

I don't even know where to begin.Playing this game is like walking down the street and seeing that beautiful girl you dated 10-15 years ago walking towards you.  You feel older, more experienced, more up to the task.  She still looks exactly as gorgeous then as she did now.  Everything feels so familiar.  You two talk, you remember some of your old jokes, but you're both older now, so some of the jokes are a bit more dirty.  You're finally able to do so many of the things you've wanted to do for years.Of course, I'm talking about the girl being the 1991 VGA remake of Sierra's 'Quest for Glory: So You Want To Be a Hero?'  The game play and feel of this game is VERY much like the old QFG games.  You need to pay attention.  Hell, even take notes.Right now I'm stuck on a part because I refuse to turn to google to figure it out.  And it's so much more fun because of that.  If your idea of a good time is to just follow an arrow to your next objective and have the game hold your hand all the way though, this isn't the game for you.  Sorry.  Go play skyrim or something.  Otherwise, buy this game.  Now.  Why are you still reading this?  Scroll up and hit 'Add to cart.'"

I just completed the game with the Magician and want to go through again with the other two hero options. I only needed to look up one hint to complete the game (and that was actually due to me brain farting at the start) but it wasn't a breeze and I died plenty of times and had loads of fun.

I was hooked until I was finished, reminded me of when I first got a hold of So You Want to Be a Hero.Pros: Good puzzles, logical solutions, great retro graphics, music and a story that kept me interested. I can rememeber all the groups, locations and whatnot so that is saying something. Too often adventure games are boring, not this one. Roehm espically - was nice to play a character with attitude vs a blank slate.Cons: Battle system was bad (QFG2 remake for how it should be done?), Stats were useless beyond clicking a few dozen times, job path didn't mean much, no matter what you must fight, etcAll in all if you like adventure games or quest for glory I suggest this game. Flawed or not it was fun, funny and worth it. Bring on Infamy 2!"

Voice acting is a little uneven at times with some characters sounding passable and others of such low quality it brings to mind the old cd version of King's Quest V (where you could hear the echo in the room all the recording was done in).  Of course, I don't play these types of games to hear fancy voicework and look at pretty graphics (although graphics-wise the background artists did a fantastic job with the vast majority of the screens).I will definitely be checking out future games in the series (I see there is a prologue and a couple other games in the works in the same world but different characters) and likely will do a playthrough with the Brigand and Sorceror classes just to see alternate content."

I bought on sale because I love old adventure games like Quest for Glory, King's Quest etc. I generally think this is a poor substitute, I would only recommend buying on a significant discount. I liked the 'infamy' aspect of the game.1) The combat sucks. It is easy, sluggish and boring. Unlike in so many adventures games that require clever solutions, most of the story in this is advanced by beating a boss, but I killed them all on my first try with little effort.2) The map is overly large and annoying to walk through, especially the dwarven mines.3) Despite the fact it is years from original release, the game is still super buggy. The triggers for interacting with objects are not properly set to the image, and you end up just randomly clicking around a thing to get the right interaction triggered. Same issue entering/exiting scenes in the game. A few puzzles can be bypassed (e.g. jello cube thing).4) The voice acting sucks, it is too loud and echoes, I played the whole game with it off.5) You tend to accumulate a large number of items that you have no use for and clutter up your inventory. It would be nice to have a chest in your room. Even QFG had the sense to include that....So buy it for cheap and play through if you like adventure games, but it isn't worth full price."

The inventory window is too small and feels like there are excess items. I have also found what I think are bugs, one that I think is going to require me to restart from the begining, because it seems I did something by accident too early in the game, and now that I ""really"" have to do it, it won't let me do it again so I can progress.Price is too high though, I got it on sale. I think $10 would be fair. I recommend the game anyway, but not really at this price, get it on sale."

A perfect homage to old school adventure games.Great music, really funny, huge open world to explore.The story is loooong. Took me 21 hours to complete, (I only needed to look up 1 hint.)There were some rooms & characters that were not involved with my path (the Bridgand) so after game was done, I read the walkthoughs for the other 2 ways to play. The 3 play methods are very different from each other. You'll get everything needed for the 3 roles, so you'll have a bag full of stuff you won't use. It prevents ""mindless click & combine"" strageies and makes you really think logically.The puzzles are ""medium"" difficulty, I never felt frustrated. It doesnt take a genius to figure these out, but I didnt find them super easy either. Since the world is so big and there are so many characters, it takes lots of time to peice together what you need to do.Captivating & fun from beginning to end.

It is very funny, has nice puzzles and it not too easy, but also not too difficult to play. Some things in the game are supposed to only happen when playing with a specific character, and that was sometimes frustrating. For example, as a sorcerer I didn't manage to get the horse, while it was very obvious that this could be done at some point in the game. The game is not too linear, but some things can only be done/learned after a particular event has happened, and this got me stuck once. The scenery, music and voices were all great.

I thought the game was too cluttered with crushing bugs, unnecessary items and a clunky layout resulting in a game full of fluff and confusion. Throw on top of that a $20  price tag and i ultimately felt that there were better games out there that had a more fullfilling and polished 'Quest for Glory' experience.After posting my review, i was surprised to hear back directly from the creators of the game. They thanked me for my honest opinion and then requested i replay the game with their first major update.Well - I didn't replay it. I figured I gave Quest for Infamy plenty of hours to prove itself a contender, concluded it had not, and moved on.Earlier this year I downloaded Infamous Quest's newest adventure game 'Order of the Thorne' (on GOG) I respected what the indie developer was trying to do for classic adventure games and figured I'd give them another shot. To my surprise, Order of the Thorne was quite charming. I felt like they nailed the old-school 'King's Quest' vibe and found myself eager to play it's next chapter.So, renewed with confidence in Infamous Quest's products, I decided to give Quest for Infamy another go. Replaying the game, I instantly noticed a difference from the updates with how the game presented itself. Gone were the bugs that plagued my first runthrough, cluttered item menus were made more streamline and that clunky feeling that hovered over the game felt far less 'unfinished game' and much more 'Authentic retro adventure game style'. Like my reaction to Order of the Throne, I found myself surprised by the changes and eager to see what the future of Quest for Infamy held.Quest for Infamy isn't perfect, but it's a commendable effort from a developer who cares about their product. Think Quest for Glory with a sprinkling of Liesure Suit Larry - It's a bit raunchy in a good way, and a lot of fun in a retro way. AAAND, for only 10 dollars now, it's definitely a contender."
