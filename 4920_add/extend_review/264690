,Recommended,264690,17194202,"Posted: 23 July, 2015",all,zooboo,"EDIT:I got super tired of reading so many complaints of people saying that the game is too hard and confusing, so I wrote aguide for beginners.This should clear up any questions you might have about the game, and if you still don't like it afterwards, then I guess it isn't for you. This review is also specifically focused on the base game and does not include any info on the DLC expansion.---This is a near-perfect lovechild of tabletop board games and roguelikes.Coin Cryptis a procedurally-generated roguelike adventure game. What makes this game unique is its deckbuilding mechanics and deep, strategic gameplay. You play as a lootmancer, one of 20 characters who hunt for treasure in the mysterious ""Coin Crypts"". The coins found within treasure chests are used for both battling and bartering, but once they're used they're gone forever. With 201 different coins to find and use, the game offers a rich variety of play.Coin Cryptseparates itself from other games in its genre through a combination of strategy and pressure. The combat system runs on an active time battle format rather than a strict turn-based system. Each coin has its own cast time, and if you take too long to decide your play, your opponent will get the better of you. There's always the looming danger of running out of coins, which immediately ends your run. Because of this, you must keep your deck lean and efficient, but also mindful of the coins you spend as they'll disappear once used. To balance this, you can donate unneeded coins to Deities, the Loot Gods, who offer specific coins that suit different styles of play such as stalling, pure offense, defensive, and more.Other than the wide variety of coins, there's also a good amount of different enemies who challenge you with specific playstyles. Some will steal your coins, poison you, force you to drop your coins, and more. Each floor has an optional miniboss that award you with items that give positive modifiers to your character. Once you've beaten 9 levels, you'll have to fight a random boss to win your run. As with most roguelikes, Coin Crypt has permadeath. Upon ending a run, you can use the money you accumulated to unlock different character classes with different modifiers that can change the way you play. Every class has to be played in their own unique way, and there’s no one method that will work for any class.This game offers great replayability, a surprising amount of depth, and good fun if you're looking for a more strategic roguelike/RPG. Be warned; it is a difficult game with a moderate learning curve. One of its biggest issues is that new players will have a hard time learning the mechanics. There is no tutorial, and the game can feel very confusing at first. It will take a lot of subsequent playthroughs to slowly understand the strategies and skills needed. Some players may get turned off by the game's almost childish art. Personally, I feel like it suits the game, giving it an almost boardgame-like aesthetic, which suits its gameplay. Some aspects may feel unbalanced, such as quick enemies or unfair coins, and there are still some bugs that have ruined some user's savefiles. Playing the game with a gamepad may feel awkward, but it plays smoothly with keyboard and mouse. Some classes are more difficult to play than others, although that's typical for most roguelikes. However, the developer is still in touch with the community and has steadily been working out the game's kinks. All in all,Coin Cryptis definitely worth the $10.00 purchase.TL; DR:One of the most underrated roguelikes on Steam. Must-get if you're a fan of collectible card games and roguelikes/RPGs."

,Recommended,264690,33105645,Posted: 1 July,all,Padded Gamer,"Can someone explain to me why people dislike this title? The combat system is a bit werid because it's not the standard used by many RPG titles.That's because it's not an RPG (Ignore that giant confusing steam Tag.), it's a single player card game where the ""cards"" are replaced by ""coins."" The combat system is easy enough for a half blind two year old stright out of the special ed classroom to figure out. (No offense to anyone with a disability. You're more then likely smarter then half these ""top"" reviewers.) It's not that hard people.Furthermore, replying directly to an actual review. IT'S NOT A STATEGY GAME. How did you, what, what, waaaat? I'm just not even going to comment on that one because it makes me lose my faith in humanity and all that jazz.I'm actually a casual gamer who doesn't like the slightest ounce of unfair challenge and I find the game to be relaxing and enjoyable. I've never used a walkthrough and nor have I needed to.The game is a fast paced, deck building game. It should be noted that this ""Confusing"" title has infomation on every single coin you pick up. If it has HP drain, or some generic stat point on it that makes it better.The deck building side is not what you expect. You have these donation boxes that are effectively ""Garbage cans"" that you throw your useless moves in into them. The more you donate to the gods, the easier this game becomes. You get more rare items and less garbage moves as you continue to please the gods. If you anger them, then say hello to that nice warm game over screen.Overall, the music is on par with Undertale in terms of being an OST masterpiece. The graphics are pleasing to the eyes. The controls are basically, one button on your mouse and the arrow keys. So that's easy enough to pick up on even if you don't own a twenty button four hundred thousand dollar gaming mouse.It's a wonderful title. Unlike most rouge likes, this is a game that you can sit down and have a glass of tea in the afternoon with. Unlike the stressful ""I could die any minute"" games that we're used to seeing in this genre."
,Not Recommended,264690,8451987,"Posted: 31 December, 2013",all,johnmyster,"[Beta Review]This game has gotten a good amount of positive feedbacks and I do like the neo-""roguelike"" genre that seems to be recently popular. I am just having a hard time getting to enjoy it. I've unlocked five or six classes and it is fun trying them out and their different playstyles, and have gotten as far as level 3-3 with the princess where a grandma killed me rather fast :P. The concept of the game itself -- collecting coins and using them to do battle -- is fine, but the implementation just seems off.The biggest issue for me is that the flow or pacing of the game feels like it is all over the place:1. Walking around is too slow for my tastes. I know this is upgradeable, but it's simply not fun to be walking as slow as you do. The pace after one upgrade is just about perfect for a standard walking speed, or a tad slower than that.2. Looting coins from enemies/chests and discovering new coins was fun for a short while, but it just seemed too hectic for me to constantly have to keep track of what coins I had at the moment, and it's easy to run out of any particular coin. I am aware this adds an element of ""strategy"" to the game, and I'm not opposed to strategy in any sense -- I love strategy games, as well as RPGs, and even some computer trading card games (whichCoin Crypt'scoin system very vaguely resembles). To me, the coin and loot system started feeling like a chore very fast.The ""cursed chest"" system also seemed good in theory, limiting players but giving them choices and what coins to pick, but looting chests quickly felt like a chore as well. The ""Choose for me"" feature somewhat helped this, but didn't entirely alleviate the pain, and I don't enjoy the game making too many decisions for me :P. Perhaps chests should hold more coins at a time, but have less chests throughout the corridors to compensate. I believe that this would make looting chests more rewarding and feel less like a chore.As with the coin system itself, I would enjoy having atleast some basic attack to count on in the heat of battle - it can be relatively weak and slow, with coins still being used the majority of turns, but all too often I'm out of attack coins or it takes 2-3 turns to draw any in my hand for combat. All too often, combat felt more like simple luck based on what coins I drew and the size of the stacks, rather than a system where I had some sense of control and that flowed well.3. Victory when enemies run out of coins is good and all, but receiving no reward on victory just makes the battle seem like a waste of time -- even a random 3 hit/heal/shield coin would be better than nothing.4. There's already discussion about and players wanting more RPG and persistent elements to the game, and I would have to strongly agree that these would help make playingCoin Cryptmuch more enjoyable and rewarding. The devs have posted that they don't want to dilute the challenge of the game, which I understand -- but the game as it is with zero progress (excluding class unlocks) carrying over between deaths seems more like a ""hardcore"" mode than the standard mode of the game should feel. Perhaps I am bias after playing through an excellent neo-roguelike and a game that is already completed,Rogue Legacy, which balances between progression and perma-death (you could call it serial-death) very nicely.In summary,ProsPermadeath actionClass unlocksUnique coin systemConsBase walking is too slowLack of satisfying progression between gamesBattles seem to rely too much on luckCoin system in general seems chaotic and not funPerhaps this game simply wasn't my ""cup of tea"" so to speak, but the elements of the game in theory seemed to be enjoyable for me, just not the implementation. I wouldn't want to turn this game into something it isn't, as it already has it's fair share of fans who have enjoyed the game and played it far more than I. But implementing these features and suggestions would hopefully turn the game into something that I would personally more enjoy, and that I believe other players would enjoy as well. Good luck devs, and thanks for reading! I'd like to keep up to date on the development of this game and may try it again after any big updates.Take care,- johnmyster"
,Recommended,264690,8584470,"Posted: 5 January, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"Coin Crypt is a roguelike, like FTL or The Binding Of Isaac. It's a game where you have to start all over again if you die. But Coin Crypt has an original concept for its battles; the loot you find, coins in this case, is also used to battle your foes.Coins can have different properties, like healing for 5 or 10 points, or doing 10 points of damage while taking 5 of your hitpoints. A fun concept that keeps things fresh. If you run out of coins it's game over. You have to be careful which coins you want to use and which ones you want to save as loot.Of course, all loot is randomized and there are several floors to go through. It's not a big game, I guess one can complete the game in roughly 30 minutes, if you're lucky enough. If you're not lucky enough, you'll at least earn experience points that can be used to unlock new classes that might you help during future playthroughs.The graphics are simple and all enemies are basically just textured rectangles, but it's cute to look at. The sounds didn't make much of an impression on me, but I guess it fits the game as far as style is concerned.Recommended for it's original take on the genre. Let's hope more stuff gets added in a later stage, because right now there's not really enough content.[Rating: 76/100]"

It's kind of like a card game but with coins. Since there are so many classes all with things that make them so different the game play doesn't get stale quickly. I like the art style but you should judge it for yourself by looking at some screen shots. Overall it's a great concept that was implemented well too. I'm surprised the game is not more popular.

The runs are fast, never lasting more than a half hour or so until you're much better at the game, and the difficulty curve is fair and rewarding to climb. They tend to introduce more complex mechanics to raise the difficulty instead of just increasing numbers. The diversity of characters along with the number of different coins and items that you can buy mean that no run ever really feels the same.My one complaint would be ther it does ♥♥♥♥-all to teach the player what is what. None of the icons or mechanics or anything are even kind of explain in a tutorial or tips system or anything. It just kind of assumes you'll figure it out or die.

76561197975236576,Recommended,264690,24121226,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,gtrabbit,"First off, this is my wife's favorite game, even though she has never played it, entirely because of the opening theme music.I would recommend this game as a fun, though sometimes challenging rogue-like romp, bringing together the constant threat of permanent death with a light-hearted playfulness.The game attempts to present itself without tutorial or much explanation, evoking the enigmatic feeling of many games in the NES era, and does so mostly successfully. (I did do some wiki-ing about the gods after a few days, as this was somewhat opaque to me). The basic strategy of the game unfolds into a fairly rich and varied system as you unlock new classes and learn how to synergize class talents with the other elements of the game. While some classes can be made into powerhouses quite easily, others seem destined for failure. Though at first I felt the obvious imbalances of the classes was a flaw in the design, I now feel like this helps lend the game its particular charm.For such a small game, this has remarkable replay value. I am not generally a completionist, and after a few winning runs, I figured I was about done with the game. And yet, several months later, I still find myself coming back to Coin Crypt for a few runs here and there, trying to finally win with one of the more ""challenged"" classes.My one complaint might be that it feels like as soon as I get a good run going, I win, and there's not much room to utilize the full capabilities of the character I've been building. Ultimately, this game is never going to be something you can obsess over. It's fun, it's fast paced, very cute, at times difficult, but is never going to require extensive theory-crafting, and I think the developer wanted it that way. Depending on what you're looking for, this could be a good or a bad thing.I also recently bought the DLC/expansion. If you liked the game and wanted more of the same, that's what it is. More content, but the same basic feel. New classes seem interesting. If you were bored with the base game, then the DLC probably won't change that, but if you were still enjoying the base game, then the expansion will provide you with new content and more play styles to choose from.All in all, I recommend the game, and give a neutral recommendation for the DLC. One of the favorites I've purchased in a while. Something fun and light-hearted; enough strategic depth to keep you engaged but not so much as to give you a headache. Good replay value and your wife will love the music."

This game was made for me down to a science.There are a ton of systems going on in this gem of a Rogue-like (A word I am using to skip over the obvious about the level generation/enemy layouts/item drops/yada yada).`Real time pillar crawling/evasive maneuvers to avoid combat sequences and a very effective fog of war that makes crawling a tenative and fun as hell experience`Combat sequences that have you use randomly drawn coins to the best of your abilities.  Each selection has serious ramifications for the rest of your playthrough (for soooo many reasons)  You will need to familiarize yourself with the coins you carry, because the enemies aren't going to stand around watching you decide what your best move is all night long.  Moving fast is the name of the game... right?`The coins used in combat also serve as your currency on passive-boost items, healing station fodder, ect.`For those who are familiar with deck building games, the coins in your inventory can be discarded and/or traded to Gods for coins of lesser value (or none, for the sake of removing dead weight)`Let's call it stressful fun, trying to not spend enough so that you can feel safe moving down to harder depths, whilst being tempted by shopkeepers with shiny treasures, and shortly afterwards feeling remorse when you don't have any coins for combat purposes.  Or perhaps just the wrong coins.`Don't leave yourself without any attack coins, or you're ♥♥♥♥ed.  Don't leave yourself without any heal coins or you're ♥♥♥♥ed.  Don't dilude your inventory with too many conflicting ideas amongst your coins, or you're ♥♥♥♥ed.`You're ♥♥♥♥ed.`Coins you carry through to the end of the game (Be it your trumph or demise) are used to spend on unlocking additional classees with different play styles.

As a fan of roguelikes, this game still hits home, but comes back because you walked way over to where it hit home because hey, its a pretty good ball.  Coin Crypt is a ball to play, simple and lovely--Humble in what it does, doesn't push too many boundaries but definitely shines as a unique rogueish experience.  The game consists of moving through rather linear levels, across 3 worlds with 3 levels, picking up chests and beating up lootmancers for coins: where your resources begin and end.All coins have a simple effect to them: Damage 4 HP, Shield for 4 HP, Recover for 4 HP, to name the most basic ones possible. Some are more interesting, like stealing coins, canceling opponent's casts, buffs/debuffs, even passive abilities like increasing your max HP, but its only use in battle is to be dropped when used. With each coin is a currency value, which is used to donate to fountains to recover health, buy from shopkeepers, or donate to deities, which is yet another unique concept that I'm really satisfied with.There are 6 deities to donate coins to, with 2 statues spawning per level.  If you donate to a statue, there's a higher chance you'll see their statue again later.  Donations make your deity smile upon your progression: if you donate to the stealing deity, he'll bless chests with his color (in this case, yellow) which, when you open, will reveal additional deity-specific coins. On the other hand, if you don't donate to certain deities, they'll get unhappy with you.  To a point they may want to see you dead.  Personally.My absolute favorite aspect of this game is that during world 1 you can opt to open doors leading into The Forge, which for the rest of the game is a different dungeon with a few differences in both inhabitants and coins. This adds a great amount of replay value in addition to the 10 classes as well.  Interestingly enough, based on your playstyle, you'll end up with a different final boss in The Forge, which really rewards the concept of replaying to win again.  Its not the most difficult roguelike either--Once you learn to fight or flight with a Grandma, you should be good.Do I recommend this game?Yes.For $10 I recommend it.  For $5 I recommend it.

But, Coin Crypt has an original twist that adds strategy, and enough polish to elevate it above most of the dross early access throws at people now-a-days.In this game, your battle moves are tied to coins. Once you use that coin on attacking, healing or any other move, it disappears. Every coin also has a monetary value that can be used to trade at a variety of points throughout the game. What all of this means is that you always need something, keeping every game exciting. If either side runs out of coins in battle, they lose, but if you defeat an enemy before they run out, you get all of the coins they haven't used. So you always have to becareful with your choices in and out of battle. You might end up with a bag full with attacks just when you're hanging on 3 hp and desparately need a heal, or a bag full of heal coins that limit your attack options significantly and leaves you to wait for the enemy to run out of coins, but then you don't get any attacks from the enemy at the end of battles!But most of the coins don't come from enemies, but from chests. You can only pick a limited number of coins from chests, giving you more choices to make. As the game goes on, more coins of different types get introduced with the enemies and chests, altering your deck to have more coin diversity.Naturally for rogue-likes, you will die quite a bit. When you die or win a run you get to spend the coins you got throughout the run into unlocking new characters. Every character plays differently but most if not all of them aren't objectively better than others. You unlock your first classes quite quickly to experiment with but the more you unlock, the more expensive they get. This is the game's way to give a purpose to each playthrough, some people will like it, and some will want a more substantial meta game. There are over 14 classes so to those who do care it will take quite a bit of play to unlock all of them!This is what early access should be, Coin Crypt was already functional from the first time it arrived on steam and has only improved ever since.So, yeah, this is worth a buy!"

I tried it on his computer and liked it so much that I bought it and its expansion regardless of them being at full price.Why? I thought it was worth it. I like games that not only have full controller support but also games with quick >10 minute runs with lots of unlockables + procedurally generated maps. I don't normally go for those given that they're tough as nails generally, but coin crypt has just the right amount of challenge (the default difficulty is normal, I keep it on normal even though I usually play games on easy).So what do youdo? Basically you're what's known as a ""Lootmancer"", a made-up type of magician I think specific to this game. You find various magical coins and use them in battle but also to unlock new areas, make offerings to gods (who get angry if you don't for a while), make wishes in fountains to heal, and buy items that give special abilities (such as being able to steal easier or +20% defense, etc). You have 2 things to look out for: HP and Coins, if either run out the run is over and you get a score based on how good you did, which you put towards buying new classes over time each with different abilities and playstyles that prioritize different kinds of coins. For example, one of my favorites is Templar and he starts weak but gets damage buffs when he uses healing coins (even if he's not damaged) so Hit (damage) coins and healing coins are more useful to him then stealing, for example.How's the controller support? I have the Steam Controller and I must say it works really well once you get used to it. It controls much different than the keyboard/mouse version or at least slightly different but it works.Who would I recommend this to?I'd recommend it to people looking for a game they can play in quick runs before work, school, or between events as the runs don't always last very long. However, I'd also recommend it to controller players that want a fun and honestly adorable game that they don't have to configure the controls for, as well as those that like a good challenge but aren't exactly into tough-as-nails games.Overall, I'd sayCoin Cryptis a good game and well worth the $10 + $5 expansion, but if you get it on the Steam Sale then it's even more value!~Cat with Headphones"

Choose the right gods, coins, items and traits to turn yourself into the deadliest thing on two legs, or at least something strong enough to scrape by. The classes play very differently, as do the different coin builds the gods support. And unlike most hybrid roguelikes, you always have enough control to build the character like you want them, even though the exact coins available will depend on luck.If you like fast-paced combat and playing around with your character build, but don't like being stuck with the same character for hours on end, this is the game for you!"
