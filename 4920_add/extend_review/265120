,Not Recommended,265120,14844190,"Posted: 11 March, 2015",all,Jimbobicus,"Simply put, this game is awful to actually play. If that's all you need from a review, you can stop here. If you want to know WHY this game is awful, keep reading.1. StorylineThe story is pretty uninspired. It's not completely terrible, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. Maybe it gets better, but I couldn't get too far due to numerous frustrations before I dropped the game. The voice acting is at best, average. WIth woodenly delivered lines, and dialogue that could have been written by a chat-bot.2. GameplayThis is the main problem. An average to below average plot/voice acting can often be made up for in gameplay. Unfortunately these developers seem to have forgotten how RTS' work.Problem 1: The perspective and selection of units.The angle of the game, and the awful awful unit boxes make it very difficult to get all your units, or select individual units, or really do basic things quickly and efficiently. Did you miss on of your units when trying to select it? Well screw you player! Because now you have NOTHING selected. Isn't that great? There are several abilities in the game that you are to use on a singular unit. This is difficult and can cause issues. Anyone who is used to a well made RTS, and want's to micro and control army effectively is in for a bad time. This however, is not the only contributor to that bad time.Problem 2: The (lack of) pathfindingYou know when you play a game, and sometimes your unit happens to go a weird way around the map to the location you sent it to? Usually doesn't happen that often, and usually isn't a big deal. That's not the case In Meridian: forgotten mechanics. Do you want to move somewhere specific? They will eventually get there. Not together, not in a timely manner, but eventually. Just hope there are no enemies to fight.What happens when there are enemies? Well I'm glad you asked! See, if you run in to an enemy, while moving around the map, chances are everyone in your dumb as hell army has separated into squads of 1. Thankfully, the enemy AI will just put them out of their misery. Now, it is possible you'll actually have your army together and want to attack. One of the basic moves in an RTS is to Attack move. In almost every RTS ever made, as soon as an enemy is in sight and range, the guns start blazing. In ""Meridian: What LSD trip made us think we knew how to make a game"", you will find, at almost every occasion, your units running directly at the enemy without firing. Without realizing that they are NOT some sort of kamikaze unit. Without deigning to obey your commands in a remotely satisfactory manner.Thanks to these amazing mechanics, you often need to retreat to try to herd your dumb struck army in to a semblance of a group so you can actually play the game. In most RTS' retreat is a viable strategy. In ""Meridian: Oh my GOD does anyone know how to walk?"" this is nigh impossible. Retreating involves attempting to move away from the enemy. In the unlikely event your units actually manage to walk away from the enemy, you will find them immediately attempting to engage the enemy. The worst part is, the terrible pathing and AI means that they will have half trying to get back somewhere, half who are going the other way and get stuck on eachother, and no one actually firing on the enemy OR retreating. The target acquisition range is just absolutely nuts. It doesn't make sense. I've had units react to hostiles WHO WEREN""T VISIBLE YET. I'm pretty sure Chewbacca lives on Endor, because it just doesn't, make, sense.Bonus problem:Hotkeys. I get having your own hotkeys for your game so you can be ""different"" so all the cool kids will like you. But changing fundamentals like moving the hold position command from 'H' to 'E' is just plain stupid. There's many similar changes in this game. ""Meridian: who even needs hotkeys anyway"" decided to reinvent their hotkeys from the refined version most games have settled with, to a new pile of crap that no one wants to be in.3. GraphicsThis is the only area where Meridian: Really Shiny gets any sort of credit. I'm not saying it's a visually stunning masterpiece. But it is nice. It's vibrant. Also really shiny. Nothing to write home about, but nothing particularly bad either.Final Thoughts: There are lots of RTS games out there. There is a reason that Command and Conquer, Warcraft 1, 2 AND 3, Starcraft 1 AND 2 are all timeless classics. There is a reason that most RTS games have similar if not identical base mechanics to each other. It's because they WORK, and they work WELL. They allow strategy, micro and macro. Meridian: Barely a functional game decided that's not necessary in their RTS. They wanted to be different, to be cool, instead everyone should be making fun of them and ignoring them."

76561198005091437,Recommended,265120,13293075,"Posted: 9 December, 2014",all,Mogul,"5/10.A late '90's style Real-Time Strategy game, with a simplistic but solid foundation.What you can expect:Around 15 hours of fun, 90's RTS inspired nostalgia... and a bit of frustration, too. Beware that  the variety of units, and some features of gameplay are very simplistic, so you will likely need to adjust to the limitations of such a basic system.Hints:In the campaign, there is often an easy win condition. For example, rush to build a line of turrets at a bottle-neck; or, look for some unguarded enemy power stations; or, rescue the group of neutral units to get a bigger army.The simulation maps are great ways to pick up a few handy hints on gameplay.A bit of a rant about the things that frustrated me about this game:Kudos to this lone developer for making what is essentially the basis for a great game. Unfortunately, the developer made a few gameplay decisions which entirely spoilt this game for me, especially since this is a strategy game. Namely:cannot attack while moving (can't even begin to list the strategic consequences of this)too few micromanagement options (such as no patrol option, no defend-this-building button, no action/movement queuing)Units sometimes wouldn't auto-acquire enemies that came in range.""attack towards"" would first move my units forwards a few meters before attacking anythingtoo few units and buildings (exaggerates hard counters, eg 2 rocket-launcher light tanks beats a whole army of troopers. What's worse is that because there are so few unit types theres a very good chance that this would happen. You end up needing to build 2 of everything which is just fiddly and annoying)Finally, I stopped playing this game after a Campaign map where the enemy has somehow amassed an army of around 100 units, and had 6 unit-producing buildings surrounded by turrets. It was an impenetrable wall of units that just kept regenerating.An example of how a fight would play out:You have a squadron of aerial fighters with high-ranged armor-piercing weapons. The enemy has a rag-tag mix of every conceivable vehicle/infanty and weapon variant.In all likelihood you'll win this one.However, you need to retreat in order to prevent the AI from focus firing your units down. You spend a few seconds moving away (taking damage the whole time and unable to damage them while doing so) they finally catch up, but their high-range tanks reached you first and they start shooting (out of field of vision range) you use the attack-towards command to save the few seconds it takes to manually target them once they come into your view. Your units fly a bit farther than was necessary due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ auto targetting; putting  their whole army in range of yours. Very soon your whole army is getting flanked and shot down one-by-one with no focus fire. You cannot do the retreat strategy because that means more time taking damaging whilst dealing no damage. You decide to manually focus fire. That's all good an fine, but you're losing damage efficiency in the seconds between then your manual target dies and when you manually target the next enemy. Don't even think about using the attack-towards function to lessen this down time, though, because we've already established that it's not viable.  .. in a last desperate attempt to win the fight you retreat slightly and attack-towards just in front of where the remaining enemy army will emerge. This time, a close-ranged scouting vehicle comes into sight on its own (slightly ahead of the rest of their army) your unit's auto-acquire this target; quickly killing it before any other enemies come into sight. You move a few meters forwards; (unbeknowst to you) you reach the spot where you'd originally anticipated they would appear... HOWEVER! The attack-towards command has finished executing. Now, due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ auto-targetting your units dont even attack the rest of the enemy army as it comes into sight. You get picked off in the following few seconds. You escape with 3 units left on 5% health each. You use AoE heal, but somehow despite your units being within the displayed grid only one of them gets healed at all."

Is it StarCraft II??...well, no.But this game puts a few interesting spins on the RTS formula that make it really interesting and fun to play. Instead of producing a standard unit and upgrading offense/defense from an approriate facility (this game has this feature aswell for unit specific upgrades), any weapon upgrades you research for your units can ONLY be applied when they are created. For example, you can Research upgraded cannons, rockets, lasers, railguns etc. that are purchased with the creation of your new unit (varried costs). Cannons are strong vs infantry, Rockets apply area damage, Lasers have increased range and Railguns jump to nearby units.Also, Commander abilities add alot to gameplay (a SC2 comparison would be hero powers, but they are only usable when you have a hero and only with hero in range). Meridian's 'Commander' abilities are usable anytime and anywhere on the map not affected by fog of war. These powers do come at a cost in the form of an regenerative energy bar and vary from Direct Damage to Healing to Increased build/production rates. These abilities are trained with points you acquire when you level up.No Multiplayer (yet at least), some pathing issues and at times questionable voice acting are the only minor concerns with this title.NOTE: This game was for the most part made by ONE MAN in 2 years. Damn impressive."

I can't send units from one part of the map to another and depend on them to get there in one piece, because they will move to that spot without fighting back against attacks on their way there. Even in Command and Conquer, units would shoot back when being attacked, but these units just march to their deaths and don't do anything to try and prevent it.2. Dumb units. Select a unit or units to attack and enemy and will they open fire once within range? Not always. Sometimes they'll walk past the enemy to shoot from one particualr side. Why would they insist on shooting from the right rather from the left even though the left is of equal distance from the enemy and doesn't expose them to enemy fire like the right side does? Who knows, death wish?Some odd programming choices here. Sadly, I'll be uninstalling the game."

The biggest problem i have with this (even though alot might not agree with me) is that in skirmish the AI does not realy fight amongst themselfs unless they happen to meet each other along the way to your base. As the player you HAVE to rush and build an army ASAP to defend yourself, leaving alot to be desired of the base itself. It also seems that the AI cheats like hell, even on lower difficulty's.

This game is really simple, but in a good way. Almost no learning curve to the basics of this game. It reminds me of Command and Conquer and the first Starcraft put together.Pros:*Even with only about 8 (I count the fighter and heavy fighter as one) units total, it's diverse.-3 Units (infantry and bomber) only have 1 available weapon.-1 Unit has 4 (Fighter/Heavy Fighter) weapon choices-4 Units have 5 (Light/Heavy Vehicles) Choices-(I count tier 1 and 2 weapons as one because the upgrade replaces the tier 1)*For an RTS it has a pretty good story to it.-In between missions you can walk around your ship and converse with the crew, run training simulations, and read about various parts of the game.*Optamization-As stated in another review, there are virtually no loading times. My rig is a 4 year old gaming laptop and missions and skirmishes load up in less than 5 seconds.*Fun campaign*Good graphics-The graphics are really good for how smooth it is, even the cutscenes are really good looking.Cons:*No way to zoom in or pan the camera.-Normally I play supreme commander, so I don't really care about panning the camera, but being unable to zoom in and out can be a minor inconvinience at times.*Short campaign-As fun as it is, it was over too soon, BUT!!! it is only on mission 5 so far. The dev is still adding missions in as the game progresses*Only one faction-I'm not even able to really speculate on whether I feel there would be another faction or not. It's too soon to tell but I don't see why there wouldn't be plans for one.*A little buggy-I had a start up error, but the crash report was very detailed and provided multiple troubleshooting ideas to solve the problem and they worked. This is an early access game, so bugs are to be expected.*Pathfinding-The AI pathfinding cand be really bad at times. I.E. I send a scout to one corner of the map and it cuts through and enemy base on the opposite side of the destination. Still good for the games current stage.Neutral Points:(These are neither good or bad, just some features that some people might like and others may not)*Snipers can outrange defense turrets*Defense turrets function like the NOD Turrets in C&C 3: Tiberium Wars (There is a central hub that is linked to turrets)*A rank up tree (level up, get perks)*Halowars Deathmatch style unit cap. You increase your unit cap by building structures.All in all I do recommend this game. More so if it is on sale."

Must configure each unit you produce individually.  Must manually assign individual workers to various tasks, even if workers are standing around idly.  This is especially bad when you go to build new buildings.  Once workers are done with a task, they're idle, which is fine as I expect to have idle workers ... to automatically do the next do-once task that pops up.  Workers can not be assigned to a task via assigning them to a building.  Workers seem to be unable to repair buildings.  You're expected to manually heal individual units on the battlefield during combat.What I was expecting was something more along the lines of Spellforce.  What I got was something where everyone acts like they're chess pieces.Like I said, if this is your thing, you'll have a blast.  But it's not mine.  Ugh.And yes, we all know you micromanager nutters are out there.  ""What's this?  That soldier will stand around and get shot unless I tell him to shoot back?

The graphics are on par with many modern RTS titles and the gameplay is, for the most part, slick and elegant. As an RTS, its only pitfall in my opinion is a lack of factions and the ability to have team battles. The game currently lacks multiplayer, but the developer has stated that he plans on adding it in later. The campaign is a very interesting take on the RTS formula with interesting and varied missions that are actually quite challenging. It's a nice throwback to the quality of RTS that we used to see back during their inception, a la C&C and Red Alert. This is a fun game that you should support as much on principle as in practice- one guy made this game, and it's nearly as good as strong titles like Starcraft and Company of Heroes."

I just can't, though.I guess the reason for a larger team instead of one person is to point out little helpful things like...

""I understand the medic scouts are fast... but it's just aggravating that they will always run to the front of the battle."" In fact, that's most of this game... could have just called it formation commander. Most of it just involves trying to keep healing units from being in the front.As for the campaign... it's tedious. It's extremely simple with hard parts that shouldn't be hard at all. At one level you're left with a tower defence portion. This killed the entire game for me. There's not enough of a story to bother spending the time it would take to beat it. You can't even adjust the difficulty... there simply isn't an adjustment. Anyways... at about level 20(of the TD mini game) I just gave up. Positioning units to protect from air attack... and then they just run off all willy nilly.Hey, and in this part... you can't control them... No hold position function.Seriously...

,Not Recommended,265120,31116493,Posted: 13 April,all,OverkillRabbit,"This is probably the worst game I have in library.If you want to, in any way shape or form, have a conventional RTS experience, this game isn't for you.If you want to have an unconventional, but fun RTS experience, this game isn't for you.If you think that devs should make sensible design decisions, this game isn't for you.I'm not going to drag you through the mechanics of this game, but I'll hightlight what is definitly wrong with this and probably won't be fixed unless they completely rebuild the game:1. Grouping.Your units are placed in a grid and occupy square spaces of the same size for all units. This doesn't have to be a bad thing necessarily, however, if you cannot pass through your own units and paths sometimes only give you two possible squares to move through, it becomes a real pain to maneuver.2. Movement.The movement in this game is abyssmal. Aside from having extreme difficulties to effectively select units, you will also encounter problems with the pathfinding of each unit. Because your own units are impassable, you may find paths in which all movement comes to a halt. If you select an area to move to, the units will get predetermined places to stand on. However, if the units in the front will have the closest squares in that area and the path is narrow enough so that they block the movement for your other units, the other units will just quit moving altogether, which results in a split of all units and not even close to the positioning the game previews. That units will never attack while moving also results in some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat encounters.3. Level designFrom what I've played, there have been multiple missions in the campaign that will result in extremely unfavorable matchups against the AI. This wouldn't be too bad if the base mechanics were reasonably well designed. However, with the current implementation of them, some missions get either near impossible even on easy difficulties or result in very long spans of micro-ing every single unit into the correct position.Verdict:I can't conceive of a single reason anyone would want to play this game. Don't buy this, not even on sale."

Meridian: New World is trying to be a throwback to the good old days of Westwood and Command and Conquer, and has many good ideas along the way, but it fails on too many levels to be anything but a waste of money. Poor controls, optimization, visuals, voice acting, and a general feeling of shabbiness ruin what may have, at one time, had the potential for an interesting experience.There is the germ of good ideas here; you can customize the loadouts of individual units upon construction, which is always neat, and the story is attempting to be that rarest of beasts, a character-driven RTS. You, the player, have a branching tech tree that allows you to perfom actions like healing individual units, disable enemy vehicles, that sort of thing. The problem is, like so many games of a more indie persuasion, the good ideas fail to live up to their potential.The customizable loadouts are a good idea, but it's done when you start building your units, meaning that by the time it's done, you may have wanted something different...but too bad! You'll need to build a new one. Compare Dawn of War, which had a fantastic loadout system.The story is uninteresting, poorly translated into english, and with pretty awful voice acting. Normally I wouldn't mind this, but they are clearly trying to use branching, bioware style conversation trees and characterization to drive the plot. Bad voice acting undermines this goal.The controls are slow and stiff, with painfully snail-like camera panning, and the ugly, impractical UI doesn't help. In a good RTS, your units feel alive, and responsive, and you are able to control them with precision and skill. Here, I feel lucky when they are even able to move where I want them to go. And if I wanted to change the controls to fit my needs, I have exactly two options to customize controls; mouse sensitivity and a toggle for ""camera panning,"" a mysterious button with no discenerable effect on gameplay.The players ability tree works well though. Kudos for that, though it was at first a little unclear how the energy bar that powers your abilities works. Unfortunately, there is only one faction (something the original Command and Conquer was able to overcome), and so the tech tree is the only source of variety you're going to get.Moving on, the game is ugly an poorly optimized. It chugged more than games that look far better than this does, and crashes frequently. I know this is part of the early access package, but you have to keep it together if you want players to stick with it until the final release.Finally, on a less easily described note, the game just feels...shabby. Other early access games have been able to have a feeling of beauty and vibrancy from the very beginning, but this game feels broken on a more fundamental level.Taken as a whole, Meridian: New World is, quite, quite awful. It is the product of one man's vision, and where for some games that means a new experience, here it is clearly the work of someone in way over their head, trying to match the work of those who are far more skilled. It would take a truly gargantuan effort to make this game worth playing at its final release date, and I just can't see it happening. Take this game as an example of Steam's famously lax quality control. Or better still, don't take the game, and go play your favorite good RTS instead."

Sadly it doesn't measure up to todays standards. The visuals are acceptable for a budget title, and the music is nice (if somewhat limited). Gameplay however is where it falls down. You have almost no control over your units, who will run in an die suicidally as soon as they see an enemy, but will happily sit around and be sniped if the shooter is out of their vision range. They will ignore opposing buildings unless given specific attack orders. There is no way to control this behaviour.Commander abilities added some depth, but couldn't be used enough to make it really interesting due to the energy limiting their use.Skirmish AI is just an exercise in who can rush first.

The unit mechanics are easily the most interesting part of the game for me. Rather than have a number of different units with a single function, you have a several units that can be built with different weapons and mining/construction gear. For example, you can have a tank that makes buildings and mines the main resource, Shardium. In terms of graphical fidelity, it looks gorgeous. Although I would prefer a zoom function on the camera controls.There isn't much that needs improving really, just focus on a greater unit variety, maybe add in other factions? And also rebindable keys would be nice."
,Recommended,265120,10976854,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,Desperado,"After reading the reviews on this title, and since it was compared to big titles like Starcraft, I had some reluctance purchasing this game. Will this be a waste of money? For a game to have the quality of a Starcraft is really asking a lot (that is whether you have to need to do so). Well, just before the summer sale was over I thought what the heck I’ll give it a go. I’m no expert on game design and graphics and so forth … I’m just a gamer that wants an enjoyable game that’s good value for money. No lagging, crashes and so on (you get the picture). I’ve been branded as full of crap when it comes to games so I see myself as a gamer with high expectations.I’ve played Meridian: New World for a bit now and I found no fault in the graphics. The detail to the buildings are good. It would have been nice to be able to zoom in closer since the characters are very small (1920 x 1080). The AI seems to be functioning well on their own. The sound is pretty decent and you have dialog options. The cut scenes was lagging a bit though … nothing serious but it’s there. I’m not an online gamer so I can’t comment on that. It may not have the online capability of bigger titles but this game does not have all that security hassles either and for me that is preferable. The price is by far more reasonable than the bigger titles. You see, you do not have to pay for the attached “prestige”.As I understand it, this game was designed by a single developer. Really? Well, if that is the case I have one thing to say to this person … you’re doing a great job. This is one purchase I will not regret. I got “bang for my buck” (pardon the pun). Do I recommend this game? I found it enjoyable so I have to say for sure! As I read in another review and to quote the person … “buy this game, or I’ll poke you in the eye”. Well, get on with it. Happy gaming."

From what I see, the ideas behind were really good. Each type of weapon had its role on different tech level. Well, really not tech levels but researching weapons and chasiss is like giving you the advantage if the enemy did not predict/react fast enough.I was really impressed that you made a game by yourself, which is good looking, not too overwhelming (supreme commander such) and simple while not being too simple. I am putting some ideas here that I think makes the game more awesome:1. More customization aspects! I could see weapons already play a ""different unit type role"" but some chassis modifier may do the job. For example, Increased movement speed, adding a shield that takes only one hit and regenerate after going out of battle. Don't need to make too complicated through. Less is good xD(but not bald :) ) See impossible creatures, I've played that game and love it especially the army customization but it was never known by all. Anyway, special modifiers do add depths to the game. Would love to see some more vehicle chassis though.2. Current state it is hard to distinguish one unit type that have different weapons, as the weapons are very insignifant to be seen (other than a whole of chimeras) Maybe: 1.Adding some modifier to the look so it is easier to distinguish the same unit with different weapons, like missile pods added on rocket chimera. 2. Make group selection weapon dependent also. currently when I double click, I select all chimeras(expect for miners) and send them to die. combining with 1, it is more friendly to micromanage during battles.3. add passive powers. Maybe not that significant as I can see energy plays a important rule in decision making?4. smoother unit movements! Flocking AI like starcraft did will do the magic! In real life army march in order instead of randomly clamp into each other right? xD Doesnt imply having to set up formations do.(I saw someone mentioned)5. one more level of difficulty! It is nice to have good ai in current state, but I would love to see overpowering ais that can drive us to adrenline( at least I am not pro gamer on rts :p)Too bad there was no infantry customization. :) They tend to be underpowered and probably may not able to cope with anything in late game (maybe because I had'nt seen all weapons yet?) I do not want to see just whole army of chimeras clamp into each other xDI appreciate your work on this game and it do refresh my seeings with rts(no more dead C&C series, boring sequences of some rts and the good but nothing-changed-on-substance starcraft2) This game just need a lot more polish to perfect.Hopes you can finish the game with surprises for us :D Anyway, I love mad cat. ;)"

Just put up 5 buildings somewhere, build cheap units and rush like theres no tomorrow. Thats the only way to win. Defending your base? Impossible. Using real strategie?

Mine resources, build your requires buildings per unit, attack with units, etc. It has a campaign, skirmish missions, custom map editor, and able to download maps from the community.

The truth is unless you choose to attack the turrets first you will fail as you dont have enough troops to destroy the other two options. Reload levl and try again.2) Another early mission suddenly turns into a 25 wave (20 min) basic tower defense game. It relies on you already established base supplying enough creds to buy turrets. however an enemy attack before this sequence crippled mine so it was impossible to get past wave 5.The skirmish game is also under developed:1) In a game on 4 players (1 human, 3 AI) all AI players (easy AI I had chosen) will attack you. the only time they fought each other was outside my base!2) You cant select teams.

Oh, there are a number of offshoots, but very few modern day RTS that still hold to the core root of the genre. Sadly while Meridian comes close, it still misses what I personally consider a true RTS.First the pros:PRO’s1.	Interesting set of weapons each with their own unique attributes. While fun, they do become redundant when all are unlocked.2.	Decent enough graphics. Cut-scenes are adequate with a few neat space shots.3.	So-so story, and a few unique missions that are out of the norm. Adding some variety.4.	Audio is well done.5.	Voice actors actually fit their role and put the appropriate emotion behind their lines.6.	Turrets and normal structure building expected of a RTS.7.	Missions where you have a locked group of units explore and fight maps. Requiring a certain level of timing and strategy.8.	Special orders/powers are always fun, and actually influence the game quite a bit. Especially on certain maps.CON’s1.	Units are incredibly limited by the end of the game. Very little variety.  With only 1 species/faction.2.	Story is so-so by the end, neither impressive nor a failure. Could have used something unique to spice it up.3.	AI programming can be very annoying. Example, send a unit to fight, but there is not enough room. So the AI sends the units around the entire map if necessary, rather than what most RTS do in pushing units forward so they can all shoot. If there is no route, they pile up waiting for the unit in front to die.4.	Long excursions, units will chase enemies to their death. Which requires the player’s constant attention in order to avoid pointless losses.5.	Some incredibly irritating missions, where the game locks you in place and forces certain actions without the options of a true RTS. For example, rather than a normal unit cap that only requires a little cache (or whatever the game wants built), Meridian has map locks where special expensive factories must be placed in unique zones that are not available on every map. Otherwise the unit cap is locked to under 10 – 20 units.6.	Mission completion usually entails exterminating an enemy’s every structure and unit. This can grow irksome when fighting multiple opponents, and a waste of time at the end. Where all you can do is cleanup of the map.While the game has a number of irritations, it also has some positive RTS draws. For the price, it is more than worth a purchase. I can only hope the developers will add some interesting content in the future.I give it 3.2 out of 5 for the overall gameplay, skirmish, and campaign."

Select your units and then send them to attack here or there, but if doing that was smoother then it would've been nice."

Voice acting isn't awful, but it's not good. Writing isn't awful, but it's not good. Same with the graphics, the gameplay, the AIs, the UI, and the story.I'm voting it down because the game is full of annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, like really slow move speeds on your ship, patroling units that are out of sync and nearly impossible to pass, and a mission that is next to impossible just out of the blue."
