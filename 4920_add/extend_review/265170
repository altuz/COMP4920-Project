Not only are you are presented with new characters, you are presented with now reworked background stages, outstanding bgm, and vigorous fighting styles which now you can take to friends since you can versus each other online.Alright, so more on to the aspects of the game itself: The game, unlike Suguri, doesn't have that vast arsenal of weapons. Those weapons are now replaced by combos and abilities so don't expect to be unlocking weapons.... Not gonna happen. Another thing to mention is that the game only presents you with two storylines of which you have to play a certain character and battle you way to the end. In addition, this game may get repetitive since it only offers you only arcade style of playing these storylines against the same characters.What are the in-game differences?-There is actually only character that can actually recieve the title as a boss.-Sicne there are no bosses, the difficulty settings are now reduced to just easy, normal, and hard. There is no special. T^T-You actually have this option of where you can activate a shield when not using a hyper. This shield requires to 1 hyper gauge. (Pretty nice when it comes to outrageous situations)-Each character has more than 1 hyper that can be accomplished by combos associated with the hyper button. You can even execute the character's ultimate hyper by having 3 hyper guages and slamming the hyper button+dash button+attack button.-Like I mentioned before, it can get repetitive, howeverm if you like arcade style gaming and like the amazing combos you can do with these characters then it probably won't get that repetitive.-Some of these characters contain abilites of which you can spam.Do I recommend this game? Of course, I do. Now this is just coming from a huge Suguri fan. :v I recommend playing it to see if you like it, or just watch gameplays of it to see if meets your standards.P.S.Still has that achievement glitch....If you have any questions about this game that I haven't discussed or left out, please tell me in the comments of this review and maybe I can asnwer them for you."
,Recommended,265170,12933558,"Posted: 13 November, 2014",all,Nektronic,"I haven't really played, well, any other bullet hell games besides Drunken Robot Pornography, so I can't exactly compare this to anything, but that is a good thing in my opinion, because it allows me to judge the game solely on its own merits, and not give it pre-set standards to live up to.Now, where do I even start. Think of this as a fighting game, except bullet hell. It's like Dragonball Z up in this♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's a good selection of characters, each with their own unique move set (well, mostly), and they're all pretty much on equal footing. This is one of those games where it's best to pick one character and master them though, because if you can combo their moves together efficiently you will become an unstoppable force. Basically, if you think the idea of epic super powered fights between anime girls sounds cool, I'd recommend this game to you, especially because of the low price for this gem as well. My one complaint would be the fact that it pretty much assumes direct control of your desktop. You can't alt+tab unless you press esc first, and the steam overlay doesn't work. Basically it's a bit more complicated to manage other programs while you're playing this one. Also, I guess it can get pretty repetitive after a while if you don't have friends to play with, but it's managed to entertain me for 50+ hours, so it's not a huge problem.Now, I do want to point out his review is based on my experience. Apparently some people are having problems running the game, it's unresponsive to their controls, or they can't get achievements. Now, I honestly haven't encountered any of these problems personally. I play with a keyboard as well, and use Windows 8, yet it runs perfectly. Even multiplayer works fine for me and my friend. So, maybe it's a problem on their end? The point is, there is a chance the game may not work for you I guess, so buy with caution."

Honestly AoS is a pretty fun game marred mainly by the rocky initial steam release and terrible response from the company. RA at least got the horrible initial bugs fixed quickly, but I'm wondering why it's so problematic when the desura release was so smooth. 1 thing they did do however, is fix up the netcode. It runs alot smoother now and has less visible lag. Also you don't have to go through the godawful direct connect system anymore and can just run off steam lobbies. Which have issues granted, but it's still less trouble than the old method. Multiplayer is still fun as hell though."

The mechanics are just so much better in the sequel, like having limits on your ammunition so you can't spam the same attacks.AoSX was fun for a while, but the online multiplayer no longer works, and Rocking Android died and quit supporting the game. I should have known better than to buy the game so late, but I wanted a copy in case I ever wanted to try the new sprites, or to play the campaign again in English. Sadly with multiplayer broken and the fanbase moving towards the newer OJ games, I recommend against buying this version of the game now."

Really, really screwed up, but good.It's a fighting game that features characters people already probably know from Suguri already, or 100% Orange Juice. There isn't too many characters, but the characters' movesets are greatly varied, complex, and exciting.The system puts you in a circular arena and you fly around and shoot/smack/bomb/entrap your opponent in a way similar to Seventh Sky, an old Flash mech game that floated around the net for a bit and never saw an update.What absolutely kills this is the emotes you get are terribad, and the Steam Overlay is nonfunctioning a la Dungeons of Dredmor (Dredmor can be fixed by adding -opengl to the launch options, by the way. No responses so far here.) The official addressing of a few problems seems to be rather absent.

The settings for multiplayer is kinda weird... it took a while for me to learn how to set it up for online play, but it worked. The learning curve isn't too bad, it could easily be a button masher. Now, the main problem with this game (other than replay ability because that depends on the person playing) is the possibility to get a broken achievement. Maybe it'll work randomly, but the ""What's Your Story"" achievement didn't show up, so I'm waiting for that to fix randomly.

I can't recommend solely based on the fact that I'm unable to play it under unknown circumstances.

Otherwise single player is pretty damn easy with that much space for you to dodge everything with ease amd not-so-smart AI. Even so, its a solid game to play alone, since you can play as many characters in the series. Looking forward to the sequel."

However, there is nothing in the way of online play anymore and some glitches remain unpatched, so it's value is ultimately lowered. Even though it's very good, buy it on sale.Acceleration of Suguri is the sequel to Japanese indie developer Orange_Juice's hit bullet hell game ""Suguri"". However, rather than make the game another bullet hell, Orange_Juice took an... odd path in making the sequel game a bullet hell and fighter hybrid. However, it worked out surprisingly well!General OverviewAoS is a bullet hell and fighter hybrid, however, it leans more to fighter than bullet hell. You choose your character before fighting, each with her own different playstyle, giving a nice variety to play around with. Each fight takes place in a circular arena, in which you are allowed to move in freely. There are various different attacks, each executeable by either pressing or holding the button or by dashing and then pressing the button. Most attacks are projectiles, but there are a few melee attacks. You can dash to get around the stage faster or to dodge energy-based projectiles (so don't try to rush through a missle). By doing damage, you can unlesh various different special attacks.Pros- Great music, all of which are remixes of songs from Suguri- Nice artwork- Responsive controls- 7 playable characters at the start, and 5 more unlockable characters, for a total of 12, each with a vastly different playstyle- Two campaigns, and various extra unlockable stories that give some backstory to some characters- Local multiplayer (haven't tried it out though because I have no friends), and online mutiplayer*- A ""gauntlet"" mode, which lets you fight every character back to backCons- *Online is dead. No one plays it anymore-- Even if you do find someone to play with, the lobbies aren't the best in the world- Some characters are worthless or broken- Each stage only has one song, which might get repetitive after a short timeNitpicks (That May Detract From Your Overall Enjoyment)- Some achievements are broken, making 100% completion impossibleConclusionThis game is great by itself, but at some point or in another dimension, it might have been amazing. There seems to be no hope for a revival of the online or a patch for some glitches, which is heartbreaking, since it's such a unique game and very fun! At the very least, there is singleplayer and local multiplayer to enjoy. However, the game ultimately feels like half a game due to the now missing online. The game is only worth it on sale now, but it's still good. If only there were a sequel to this game on Steam to play, I'm sure it'd be great, especially with a living multiplayer community... Hmm..."

76561198127444181,Not Recommended,265170,26066057,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,jetb1ackx,"I've found myself warming to this since I wrote the last 'review'.While I still won't recomend it (Mostly because of AoS2 being localized) I can say that the soundtrack isn't as bad as I first pointed out, now that I listen to it outside of the game I find myself liking it but seriously, that VIsitors mix (Used for the title screen) is awful.AI isn't great, most characters can be beaten by sitting on top of the screen as Saki and carpet bombing them with her maracas, looking into the situation of this translation/Steam release (I.E. looking at a translated page on Orange_Juice's website) reviels that a character was added for the Steam release, this character happens to be Sora, who has the most broken AI in the game and from what I can remember was very difficult to play as, which makes me wonder why the AI was so difficult to vurse. Then again, it may be because I was still very bad at Suguri at the time. ""Why?"" I wondered ""Why add Sora?"" when by the time this was released on Steam AoS2 was out, I thought about this for a while and came to the conclusion of the initial localization being done after Sora had come out (The initial localization released in 2012 and Sora came out in 2010), hence why not add her to a eight year old game?Before anyone asks 'How do you know Sora was added?' I will say this, she has no dialouge, never apears in either of the stories and is only found after clearing one (Or both, I did them one after another and thus wouldn't properly know) of the stories, even QP gets some dialouge in the second story.Art! I remember hating the character art for this, not too long ago I found out that it was done by a different artist (I should have figured that in the first place) and to be honest, some characters kind of fit with the alternate art style, notably Iru fits in rather well, however Suguri, the main character of the entire series, does not fit in at all, thing is, I have no idea why I dont like how she looks, but looking at it grands against me somehow.In the story dialogue the artstyle changes completely, to something more reminiscent of 200% Mixed Juice with the pixels toned down by quite a lot, I even think they recycled a couple of images for 200% from this, this different artstyle works for me... somehow, again I can't say why I liked it, maybe because it was different from the other art and came as a bit of a shock to me.The main Story is much more laid back then in Suguri, it does have it's funny moments, where as Suguri tried to be very serious at all points, but flopped when a midget calls another midget 'short'.The second story...No I should stop and complain again, why not stay on topic with the stories?There are two of them, both with 6-7 fights in them, and with each fight on a 90 second timer along with the game being generally easy even a bad Suguri player can get through them on easy very quickly... Hmm? Being beaten by Kae on normal in Suguri gets you to ~99th in the world score wise? WELL THAT JUST UNDERMINED ITSELF!But in all seriousness, if you have even a little bit of experence in a Suguri game, can get over not having a Dash Cancel or a Weapon Cancel and through the clunky combat due to not having those features than you'll get through the story very quickly.As I would say to anyone who wants to play Suguri or Sora a controler of some kind is recomendable (The Orange_Juice site recomends an 8 button joypad) In Suguri and Sora this recomendation came from needing the dash key away from weapon keys but still close enough to be used on the same hand so you can get into a fire, cancel, fire, cancel [Continue for as long as in combat] pattern easily, and without hitting a different key acidentally, mucking up your pattern. Here it's more of a 'I'm used to combat in Suguri/Sora and this feels right for me' situation.Personally I didn't know anyone else who owned this until very recently and as such have not played the multiplayer, from what I've read the servers were somewhere from bad to awful, with losing connection during a game being a big issue with the Steam version in particluar. (Maybe the DRM-free version and the US exclusive PS3 port had better conections but I wouldn't know) Looking at the menu that comes up when starting the game suggests that there may be LAN support which should be fairly stable, otherwise I hope you know how to port forward/know your current port. (At least Fruitbat Factory is trying with Steam lobbies for AoS2, though thats a huge reason as to why it's been 14+ months since they anounced the localization) I would imagine large amounts of lag to be a killer here with the fast paced gameplay, having to dash through some projectiles and avoid others, even a delay of 100 ping would give a huge advantage to the host.While this review has gone on for way too long than it needed too I feel I should write a conclusion. So, here it goes.Since writing my first (Very poor) review I've warmed to the game, and mostly it's soundtrack, it's AI ranges from pitifully easy to very difficult but there is no middle ground. There is a slightly confusing story as to why Sora is a playable character which revolves around the fact that the game was six years old when it was first localized and eight years old when put on to Steam, the actual story has some comedic vibes to it and ends rather abrubtly, the story modes end very quickly and are very short, a joypad or controler is recomendable for a few aspects of the gameplay, the multiplayer that the game is sold on was poorly done, may have LAN support and dosen't have any lobby system, requring you to directly connect to an IP and a port.I just remembered, there is another aspect of the game that I havent touched on. Besides from the story modes there is a larger story telling aspect with this game, a series of unlockable cutscenes featuring a character talking in the first person, telling their story, answering some questions about the lore of the entire series, the first one you unlock is Suguri telling her story, there will be spoilers here, for the entire series.Some time after the end of Sora's seventh stage (Max six years) Suguri wakes up for the first time in six years, she has been given her powers and is ready to fix, single handidly, the destruction caused by the war Sora fought so hard to stop. She gets given a mirror and remarks about how her eyes have turned red at some point between before being operated on and that moment in time. Suguri's dad, of whom she talks so highly of during the events of the first game, explains that she has been 'asleep' (I.E. In a coma) for six years, Suguri remarks that she is now ""old enough to drink"" (Seeing as the drinking age in Japan is 21 we can estimate that she was placed into a coma at least by the age of 15) From this comment Suguri's dad decides to throw a party, to celebrate his daughter waking up, the repair of the earth, and the six birthdays Suguri missed out on. So the first thing Suguri would do after waking up from a six year coma is help her dad cook. Suguri then remarks that she acknowledges that if she takes care of herself she could live for ""hundreds of even thousands of years"". Jump forward many years, right to the end of the first game, just before fighting Hime, she mentions that she is ""over ten thousand years old"", Suguri simply replies ""Same."" Giving us an aproxamite time difference between Suguri and Sora, seeing as Hime apears in Sora's 'EX Stage' it places the time of the stage taking place after Suguri, meaning that Sora is also over 10,000 years old. This also gives us an aproximite age for Suguri as of the first game, she is around 10,020 years old (Assuming Hime was born the day Suguri woke up) however this figure could vary quite significantly.Just wait for AoS2 if you don't care about lore, otherwise this game can be passed up if you want, it provides a couple of answers for lore but over all that isn't worth $5 USD, wait for a sale."
