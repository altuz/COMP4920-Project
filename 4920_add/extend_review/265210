,Recommended,265210,13437187,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,Snicker,"First of all, this is not a long game.  It is, however, entertaining for the content it does have.  If you've ever heard the Weird Al song ""The Night Santa Went Crazy,"" this videogame explores the aftermath.Based on the Viscera Cleanup Detail series of games, instead of being set in a typical video game world (""Space Janitors!""), this one takes place in Santa's Workshop, where you play the one elf who appears to have stayed home the night before.  The rest your fellow toymakers can be found strewn about the workshop in various pieces.  Santa's Rampage has left no survivors, (no, not even the reindeer), and it's up to you to clean up the mess.Your job here is to mop up the spills and smears of blood, pick up and dispose of any inappropriate objects and generally return the workshop to it's original state, as much as possible, given that at least one door was blown off its hinges.  Gameplay is fairly simple, though sometimes a bit wonky in the controls.  You get a mop, a ""mess detector"" and a pair of gloves.  You can also pick up buckets of water or biohazard bins to help in the cleanup.  You use the mop to wipe up the mess, then dunk the dirty mop into a clean bucket of water, cleaning the mop, but eventually dirtying the water.  Disposal of waste is handled in the most efficient manner possible: the fireplace, of course,   Care must be taken because some objects are more volatile than others, and disposing of them in the fireplace can be hazardous to your health.   But a steady hand, and lots of patience will see you through the game.It's not high entertainment by any stretch of the imagination, but for an hour or so of laughing every time you pick up a mangled elf corpse (""Fritz!  He killed Fritz!  That lousy, stinking, pot-bellied slave-driver! That despicable animal toy-monger!""), nothing beats Santa's Rampage."
,Recommended,265210,8082602,"Posted: 17 December, 2013",all,Daniel Potter,"It's cheap, yet gives quite a refreshing experience.Basically, Santa got mad and terrorized everyone in the workshop, and you are here to clean up. The game isn't violent, it's just that it's very bloody.The whole process takes about 1.5 - 2 hrs (at least on your first try).You will have to get rid of the bodies (by burning), then wipe away the blood and get rid of all the broken stuff, then a bit of layout adjustment.You might be thinking that it is too repetitive and will become boring, but in fact it isn't like that at all.One really impressive thing is the sense of completion this game gives you. If you step on the blood you will leave footprints, that's why you are most likely to clean areas bit by bit. You really feel how the place changes around you. There is also coop in this game.I am dead serious. No joke. Give this game a try. This game itself is a short demo to their upcoming game that is set in a space station (with numerous levels to choose from). The is also another demo which features the first level of the newly released Shadow Warrior remake, but personally, i think this is a better version.Also, it costs about 2$."

You have to clean up the mess after he left to deliver some packages. Pretty funny game in the Viscera's series. Fun for a while but it soon gets a bit boring. As you are a lot of time in the same space and virtually nothing happens other than you wiping the floor. The handling of all the stuff is a bit cluncky so you now and then kick your own bucket and you can start over again. Like the real life of a janitor I suppose.One annoying thing to mention is that you cannot save the game so if you want to clean the whole place you better reserve some time. You also don't have an indication about your progress other than the stuff you don't see anymore. The 'real' game is still in alpha so i guess this 'by-product' shows the state of the game at the moment. Fun for a little while.

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

And even I can't begin to imagine what kind of OCD-riddled lunatic would actually be able to get the Achievement in this game which involves cleaning each and every inch of Santa's heavily-soiled workshop.That's not to say it's a big gaming area...an ""open-world"" game this sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥ain't, even if it still feels a tad sandbox-y for my tastes (read: no story, and potentially bottomless gameplay). Santa's workshop is literally just a handful of rooms, but man...the effort it takes to clean up even a couple of bodies and a few pools of blood...ya gotta be a freakin' SAINT to have that kinda patience, let me tell ya.Hell, it took me a few unsuccessful attempts before I was even able to plunge my blood-soaked mop into a bucket of water without spilling said bucket and having to go get a new one. A SAINT, I tell ya. Me, I quickly gave up on such a monumental, pedantic task and set to simply making MORE of a mess and blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. At least that was vaguely ""fun"".Look, it's a cute little (emphasis on ""little"", as in short and marginal) gimmick game, with an amusing and original premise (based, of all things, on a Weird Al Yankovic song - ""The Night Santa Went Crazy"" - or am I just making presumptions here?). A premise which, in all fairness, could never have been stretched beyond the few hours of gameplay on offer here.I'll probably play just long enough to get a couple more Achievements - the easy ones, not the one I mentioned above - then I guess I might dig it out for a half-hour every second or third December as a brief antidote to all that unbearably fake ""Christmas cheer"" (before I inevitably tire of its limitations and muster up the will to play something more rewarding).Consider this a RESERVED recommendation at best. It's no masterpiece, even for a ""gimmick"" game (see Little Inferno if you want a novelty game far better than it has any right to be). But it is distracting enough, for however brief a spell. And with a title like that, honestly...what were you expecting? Keep your expectations low, and you'll be fine. The worst that can happen is you'll decide you wasted a couple of your hard-earned bucks and hate Christmas EVEN MORE.And there's nothing wrong with that.

Santa subsequently snapped under the pressure, purchasing several crates of 12-gauge shotgun rounds, steak knives, and dynamite sticks, and fashioning several makeshift molotov cocktails (likely under the influence of alcohol). Santa then went on a murder spree, mutilating several elves and reindeer, and destroyed parts of his workshop in the process. He left the scene through unknown means.After these events, the company ""Polar Sanitation Co."" employed the player and sent them to clean the workshop, where the player's role in Santa's Rampage begins.For the ending of my review i can say that the developers did not do the normal online game, where each can play with friends or just a stranger who finds your game.My mark is 8/10."

,Recommended,265210,8385916,"Posted: 28 December, 2013",all,DeadPoolX,"The paper-thin premise for this game is that you are a janitor whose job it is to clean up the mess Santa Claus made after he went postal at the North Pole. That's about it for story and background, but if you're interested in this title, you're not here for the in-depth plot and character development (which is good, because there is none).You arrive in Santa's workshop and you see the entire place is a huge mess. There are body parts (of both elves and the reindeer, including Rudolph) strewn all over the area. There's copious amounts of blood and other chunky pieces of meat in various places, sometimes even in areas you wouldn't normally expect.A lot of detail has gone into the environment, including a hole blasted through a wall (complete with scorch marks) and numerous items, ranging from chairs to presents to toy guns (which the elves apparently used to ""defend"" themselves against Santa) that you can interact with.Just about everything can be manipulated through the game's physics engine, so while it can be neat to see how one item can affect another, it can also lead to awkward positioning. For instance, there are bio-hazard boxes you can use, but it's often a real chore to get the elves' broken, twisted, and sometimes dismembered bodies into them. What usually ends up happening is you'll see an elf's head or leg clip through the side of the box, which will then sometimes lead to the box jumping around by itself. Basically, it's the same old problem ragdoll physics have always had when bumping up against an object.Now... onto the cleaning. Your mop can clean up blood, but in the process it gets blood-soaked. After a while your mop will start spreading and smearing blood. When this happens, you can grab a bucket of water and rinse the mop. It'll be clean again and available to wipe away various bloody bits.However, each time you rinse the mop, the water in the bucket gets bloodier and bloodier. Eventually the bucket will be so bloody (and this is readily apparent) that dipping your mop in there will only serve to get more blood on it. Fortunately, you can get an unlimited number of buckets of clean water from a machine in Santa's workshop, although sometimes that same machine spits out a torn off leg or an unidentifiable chunk of flesh.To keep people interested long after the novelty of wiping away blood has grown stale, the developer put in a bunch of achievements to gain. Most of these are fairly easy to acquire, but a few can be difficult and time consuming.There is no way to save your game, so although you can ""clock out"" near the workshop's entrance, you won't return to the point you last left off. This isn't a huge deal, but if you've gone through the effort of meticulously cleaning Santa's workshop, you'll want to take some screenshots as it'll be a mess again when you return.I should note that ""Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage"" is actually a variant of a free game (technically an alpha), created by the same developer (RuneStorm), simply entitled ""Viscera Cleanup Detail."" Everything is the same in the free version except the setting, which is on a space station, and a lack of achievements. Something the free version has that Santa's Rampage doesn't, however, is the opportunity for online multiplayer gameplay. Whether or not this will be added to Santa's Rampage is anyone's guess.Viscera Cleanup Detail is only free right now because it's an alpha. It will cost at some point in the future, and if you pre-order it, you'll automatically get a Steam key for it, plus Steam keys for Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior and Santa's Rampage. The URL is here:http://www.runestorm.com/visceraSo would I recommend Santa's Rampage? Yes, provided you get it on sale (I paid about two bucks) or you get it by pre-ordering the regular Viscera Cleanup Detail. There's not much of a game here, but it's a fun activity if you've got too much time to wait around, but not enough to engage in a longer, more detailed title."

There is also a big container you can spawn that offers more space for items, but it can happen that the bodies and items spast out inside of the container and make a bigger mess therefore i didnt use it often.Sadly if you use the bucket or container machine sometimes body parts and dynamite falls out. In my opinion this makes the gameplay not more intense but is just an annoyance.There is only 1 map to clean. You can probably add more via mods but its bad just to have 1 map in the base game, i tought there would be many places to clean santas mess up.There is also an option to take a sniffer which blinks and tells you where you missed blood or dirt. Good idea in my opinion.6/10 Better than the average, can recommend it to some people but the game doesnt offer much and it gets repetetive soon, less in co-op obviously but since there is only 1 map its not really worthwile to invite a friend over.

Viscera Cleanup also offers a local or online co-op mode so you can even mop with your friends.

There is something calming about cleaning up the destruction of others, but as soon as you accidentally bump an elf head into the freshly cleaned wall which results in even more splattered blood, then you start seeing red (no pun intended). I wanted to go on a murderous rampage myself after finding out, no, leaving the game through the pause menu instead of the check out computer doesn't actually save the game. If you need to go out and get something while playing this, just leave the game running and hope it doesn't crash (it did, the second time I tried cleaning - so much rage). Hours. Hours of careful, meticulous cleaning and hoarding of elf heads wasted without even praise. It was ♥♥♥♥ing bull♥♥♥♥♥♥But still.

It's the janitor, the sanitation engineer, the industrial hygenist, and you get to step into his shoes to do just that in Viscera Cleanup Detail. The developor, RuneStorm, is working on the main game but has released this (Santa's Rampage) and Shadow Warrior mini-game versions ahead of it.Work with a mop, your hands, and a sniffer (stain and junk detector tool) and clean up the mess that, in this case, the jolly bearded guy made after drinking one too many Slack Spaniel Whiskey and Hurlington Eggnog concoctions. Watch out for the various weapons of mass destruction he left unused in his wake though.This Santa version and the Shadow Warrior version comes 'free' if you pre-purchase their main game on their website. If you purchase Shadow Warrior you get the SW version. Personally I recommend the Shadow Warrior version because it's a lot more polished and less buggy.This game is worth getting even if you later pre-order their unfinished game. Currently at least, you can always give the Steam key to your friend (it's through Humble's store). Just be prepared for the bugs."

At the the price of about $3 the game has suprisingly good quality and graphics for something that inexpensive. However it does take a long time to pick up   but is more fun and helpful when playing with friends on Steam that also have the game. There is lots of small details on the map that are interesting to find and some you get achievements for finding. The only problems I had with the game was the length of time the game took to complete and how sometimes the clock off button did not work.

Probably one of the most interesting aspects of this game is its ability to take something as disturbing as cleaning up dismembered elves and gore and makes you view it as a janitor would - as a job. Very quickly, you will stop perceiving the scene as a horrible, bloody murder and instead think about it in terms of how many buckets of water you need, what you can fit in a bio hazard box, where you need to stand so you don't track blood on the floor you just cleaned and so on. For such a simple basic concept, Santa's Rampage is very entertaining.It is, however, held back by niggling problems. There's no tutorial of any kind, for one, so you're left to guess at what any of the tools do. This is especially problematic with the ""sniffer"" which finds... Blood and ""broken thing"" I think, but I've no real idea what it racks or how it works. You're never given an explicit objective other than a very general order to clean the place up, but you can never be too sure what you're supposed to destroy, what you're supposed to keep or what anything does. Worst is the fact that success requires the cleaning of ALL stains, which can sometimes be so faint as to be invisible or in inaccessible places (the high ceiling) or behind objects. I've yet to succeed at this, and I can't figure out why for the life of me.In the end, though - for the price that the game asks, this is WELL worth buying. I would heartily recommend it. Unless you're squeamish."

It's like unlocking an ""anti game"" play mode in a serious FPS where you get to totally go against the normal play style.If you like to just play an FPS game, beat it, then move on to the next challenge... VCD will probably bore you to tears.Essentially, you'll either love or hate VCD. There's not too much middle ground.Santa's Rampage was an interesting entry in the VCD experience, but, once again, they didn't really tap any potential beyond what normal VCD provides. No exploration, no secrets, no puzzles... just cleaning.I know VCD revolves around cleaning, but I view VCD in the same vein as the Thief series of games. You have a primary game-play aspect, but certain levels and things had you solving mysteries and messing around with other stuff as a secondary aspect. VCD needs to really tap into this potential if it wants to grow beyond ""cleaning simulator"" status.The stage is entertaining, but you end up with dynamite that doesn't seem to serve a purpose other then make a mess when incinerated (unless you know how to properly dispose of it). The slaughter was funny to look at. There's a few gimicky secrets (eg: the painting that tosses x-mas balls when you whack it).But, it's mostly just x-mas themed VCD. I know, that's what you would expect. But, I think they could have done more with this. I still recommend it, though."

Design of the level is not suited for the gameplay mechanics on this one. There are numerious objects that you must pickup and spots that you must clean in places far above you reach.Stacking boxes to reach them doesn't work since trying to put more than 5 boxes on top of each other is virtually impossible. The engine is not designed to do such a thing.Containment boxes are largely useless because present boxes do not fit in them.Dynamite can literally make it impossible to complete the level by sending some dirt to the ceiling, where you cannot ever reach.Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior although shorter is infinitely better designed.

(Santa is tired of  increasing taxes, children wanting one of everything, and the tedium of being a jolly ole soul for over a millienia). What ensues is a bloody and eggnog fueled rampage from said jolly ole soul. The game has you cleaning up dead elves, reindeer, bottles of booze/eggnog, letters from a unfaithful Mrs. Claus and other bits of ridicliousness. Kudos goes to the game dev. for a orginial game and funny concept. Where the game falls flat is in the actual development .I can't be to hard on this because of two things,first this is a indie game that is still in development and second the price tag is only 2.50. For the amount of gameplay/achievements that you get the price tag isnt bad at all. But when the game will not let you complete said achievements because of  under development it can be problematic.Graphics  8/10The graphics do a good job of  dropping you into the jolly legends workshop. The happy, cheery enviroment is a stark contrast to the blood and gore  in the game. It is a very detailed (right down to tracking bloddy footprints behind you when you step in viscera). The graphics arent the best in the world but they do get the job done.Sound 8/10The sound is much the same as the graphics they  are very detailed. All of the sounds that you would expect to hear are present and accounted for, If you pick up a eviscerated elf you will hear the jingle of the bells  attached to his  shoes. This is just one example of the sound design. As a side note there is a radio that plays terrible Christmas music that...if you are anything like me...you  will quickly destroy the radio.Final NoteI can't recommend this game in its current state. The graphics,sound and gameplay all make for a interesting game. I can recommend someone  to keep a eye on this game because with more time this could be a fun  game.. Also the game is fun and very funny I enjoyed myself with it I just wish the gameplay was there a bit more,"

Viscera Cleanup Detail started as a standalone mini-game for Shadow Warrior. While it was boring cleaning up dead guys, the gore shocked most. Now in this edition, apparantly Santa got pressured by elves, dumb wish lists, and reindeer crap. He took a shotgun, a knife, and rage, and killed everyone. While this is disturbing for those young Steamers out there, once again, the gore shocked most into playing it repeatedly. The game features those surgeon simulator graphics, so it wasn't realistic. However, the graphics mean nothing. The only thing that caught players' attentions, was the shocking aftermath and story.So in conclusion, the cleaning is boring for most, but the fact that Santa melted under pressure shocked players into enduring @#$! to clean it all up!"

But as of right now, for less than £2, I can't really complain. Much.Apart from TNT sticks randomly appearing from machine where I get bucket of water from, messing up the house further D: Stupid luck!!But yeah, if you happen to think it looks fairly fun even if it dumb, give it a try at least.

You get to clean up blood and dead body parts and as groose and boring as that may sound it can give you hours of fun especially if your OCD and want to lean every square inch of Santas house. There are also two other games that go with the original and shadow warriors which just have new maps that you can clean and find new things in. The whole game series is amazing with a pretty nice look to it and it runs very smoothly even when recording. So if your a huge fan of good looking games, simulators ETC then buy this game plus when there are $2.49 deals for this game its a no brainer buy for this game!!!"

,Recommended,265210,11440222,"Posted: 27 July, 2014",all,EDM Yuki,"Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is a charming, yet buggy, game. It's a simple janitorial simulator where you are in charge of cleaning up the aftermath of Santa's murderous rampage. You will see the gibs of many elves and reindeer, broken eggnog bottles, weapons, blood, etc. You must get rid of all evidence of foul play and make it presentable for the people that will take over the workshop.The environment is fun to look at and chat about. If you are playing with a group of friends you will find yourselves laughing at letters written by spoiled children as well as the way the killing spree played out. If you are in a chatroom with many people, this game is a great way to have fun if you are into roleplaying... that is if you are able to get the multiplayer working. In order to play online with friends you need to be able to port forward your router or use a VPN, such as Hamachi or Tunngle. If you are unfamiliar with these, or if you are unlucky and can't get it to work, you will only have access to single player. This sucks because playing this game by yourself is boring. After cleaning up for a good hour or so you will realize that cleaning the workshop is not worth the effort. Why? First, getting the workshop 100% clean is a chore. Sometimes items will become unreachable due to the bugs in the game. Other times, it is almost impossible to dispose of the dynamite or molotov cocktails properly. You need a water bucket to place the explosives in. When you put the bucket into the furnace it will tip over. This only happens with the water bucket when there are explosives inside.There are achievements for this game, but I don't feel that they are enough to keep you coming back to this game. Overall, it's a great one-time experience with a group of friends. I recommend it to anyone who is able to set up the multiplayer and have a chatroom of people. If you can only play single player due to your unfamiliarity with port forwarding or VPNs, then I would not recommend this game unless this game is your type of game in the first place.There could be some fun in looking and exploring the environment, but once you have seen it all it will get boring. It's only $2.50 on Steam, so it's not that expensive. At the same time, there are better and more exciting games you could be playing with that kind of money. I recommend it so you can look at the environment, but don't expect much after an hour or so of playing if you are playing alone."

The game is very short but lasts a long time if you mess around and clean everything. The 1 world you get in this game is very small so dont expect allot of exploration.The 2 things I liked about this game:1 - Reading santas letters from spoiled rotten kids and legal letter from people trying to sue santa clause for breaking into there houses through the chimney and tracking soot everywhere and stealing TVs. (NOW I KNOW WHY SANTA WENT ON A RAMPAGE)2 - When your cleaning around the workshop when you think your done with a room your mistakenly wrong look at the walls and sealing and you just may find a gorey little easter egg.

I checked all around that area with ghost mode and my mop,  but couldnt get the sensor to stop going off!. i beleve that i beat the game tho and thats all that counts :P anyway, this game is fun to mess around in even with the bugs.

Besides the original alpha (which is still up for download on the dev's website) this is the only official independent release of the game. There was one that came with Shadow Warrior as well, and I can imagine that one is just as fun.First of all, yes, this game is a joke. That's the point. It's witty, it's sarcastic, the concept is amazingly silly, but it's an extraordinary amount of fun. For a game that may as well have been titled ""Janitor Simulator 2013"", I think this game has given me more pleasure for $2.49 than at least half the big brand games out there have on sale.Don't get me wrong. This is a fairly one and one kind of game. I'm not saying the appeal will last forever. But with it's 13 achievements and cheap sale price, you can get at least 3 or 4 hours of fun out of this game. Not only that, but supporting it means you're providing the funds for the developers to keep making more. As we've already seen with Shadow Warrior, this medium provides the potential for dozens of parodies.Viscera Cleanup Detail runs on the Unreal Engine 3, which means that any of game running on the Unreal Engine 3 has the potential of being ported easily for this game. This list includes, but is not limited to: Bioshock Infinite, Alice: Madness Returns, Borderlands 1 & 2, Deadpool, Dishonored, Devil May Cry, Mass Effect, Sanctum, Section 8, THIEF, Tribes: Ascend, XCOM, Outlast, Xeno Clash II, and on and on and on the list goes!And for each game you could have different interactions and achievements, possibly even hard mode scenarios where you have to work around the NPCs that are there, such as cleaning up around workers in the slums of Finkton, or having to clean up around the club goers on Omega while being able to interact with the local barman. The potential for this game is all but endless.My point is if you haven't had a chance to play this hilarious game, do so. Go and download the Alpha off their website (Google it ya bums!) and if you like it, spend the $2.49 and support the creators. I would very much like to see more of this game in the future."

Finding Rudolf's nose, elf corpses used as throwing knife targets, letters to Santa, and even empty Jack Daniels rip off bottles called ""Spack Spaniels"" are hilarious little details.

On top of that he received notes from naughty children, who wanted specific things fromg him so they could do naughty things. There's also a note where Santa's wife, Mrs. Clause, stating that he was leaving him.

I'll admit it was very funny and cool at first but as soon as i figured out how to clean and got everything done it got boring fast. I would suggest not using explosives considering they will just cause unreachable stains and bottles you cannot reach to dispose of. The multiplayer I have not tryed but I think it would be 10x faster and more fun with a partner.RATING: 6/10WHAT I RECOMMEND:I recommend if you have spare 2.50 in your steam wallet and so does a friend to buy it and mess around it is fun finding all the hidden dead elfs.

It has a low price so it's definitely not the fear of emptying your wallet that should stop you from getting your hands on a mob and bucket.

I even threw in a couple console commands to be sure. I check out and confirm that the job is done, only to find out I must have left a single shell casing in one of the haystack meshes and got 99% completion and caused one of the reindeer to die by choking on it later.11/10 will have a part of me die again"

This comes with the base game, so it's no skin off your nose if you like this or not. But you probably will like it, because it's just so funny. Play with friends, too."
