Like that toy robot your grandpa bought for you than can pretzel its way into a truck cab and is called Optimally Prime Transporter?This game was okay. It is certainly entertaining enough to keep you engaged for the 60-90 minutes it takes to complete.But it still feels like Machinarium. A lot. Only difference is that someone took all the creativity and charm of Machinarium, and replaced it with an antropormorphic condom that makes you wish you were playing Machinarium instead."

Well that may be so if you are a hardcore gamer. But for a 6 years old child the puzzles were just right (I had to help with a couple but mostly he could figure everything out himself). The aesthetics of the game are nice, there is nothing that wouldn't be ok for PG rating and the character himself was found to be cute.So I recommend it if you have a kid or if you like casual games of this sort (point-and-click puzzler with nice hand drawn aesthetics).If you're looking for an action packed game, I don't know what you're even doing here :)"

,Not Recommended,265330,12733334,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,Bastwood,"A simple find-the-clicky-spot type of adventure. Aliens have stolen the dog of the protagonist, who looks like a middle-aged sackboy. A bunch of totally random shenanigans follow. Nothing really makes sense or coalesces into a rational narrative, but neither is anything really that funny, quirky or zany. It's just weird for the sake of being weird.Gomo feels like an animation showcase: Most of the time you're waiting for a lengthy non-interactive walking/climbing sequence to complete so that you can start looking for the next hotspot. Surprisingly mind-numbing gameplay for a game categorized as a puzzler. The only thing that puzzles my mind is what were the designers smoking when they decided this poor man's Samorost was something they wanted to do?"

Completing the campaign took my only about an hour, so I personally wouldn't fork out the entire price tag.You are Gomo, a burlap sack of sorts who must travel the world in search of his best friend. You literally will go to the moon and back in your search of this majestic, dreamlike world. The character does move quite slowly, but since the world is so well crafted I didn't mind.The puzzles are quite easy and require some simple solutions, but they will not indicate if you are successful or not which can cause you to waste a little time before moving on. I found that the simple overlooked solution is generally the right one.Worth $2.99; it’s good but only 1 hour in length.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

It only has about six easy puzzles to figure out and a boring storyline. You learn nothing about Gomo except for the fact that he lost his dog. You don't know what he is exactly, why everything is underground, why these aliens took his dog in the first place, why you randomly travel back into time to nuke a town (the only humurous and non-irritating part of the game to me), why above ground is like a farm type of area...the unanswered questions really are endless. He moves very slowly with every movement which is irritating and the sound effects are absolutely horrible. All of the sound effects literally sounded like the creators made them with their mouths. For example, when Gomo falls, it sounds like a literal whistle noise someone is making. I would suggest not this gameto anyone. It was a complete waste of time and money. Oh and one more thing, the ending credits are very strange. And it's not even a funny strange really; just a super weird ""this game just made me mad and now I have to deal with what the creators think is humorous"" strange."

Gomo is really cute and does a lot of adorable things and the game is difficult enough to keep you playing but not so hard you quit. However sometimes it does get way to easy and it can be pretty tedious. Plus the lack of a story is a bit lame and I wish I could learn more about the world. And it is waaaay too short for almost $10 dollars. If it's on sale it's worth the buy but it's definitely got it's kinks.

It's a little over an hour long, and you guide Gomo through various casual puzzle levels, mostly operating some machinery, as he (she? it?) sets out to get the stolen pet back. There's not really any dialogue, and your inventory only has 3 slots (which go unused most of the time), so you can see it's not much of a point&click adventure in the traditional sense, but it operates as if it was one, and the art certainly conveys the feeling that we're moving in a weird and alien world. Windowed, it is 800x600; fullscreen, slightly larger (1030x800 ?) with black borders added.For its length, the regular price seems a bit steep, but the game has been bundled a few times and goes on deep sales regularly, so it is quite possible to buy this game for a price that is more reasonable. If you manage that, it's certainly a pleasant way to while away an hour.Get it on sale."

I don't think I've ever had more than two items in my inventory at any point of the game. You can't combine them, you can't look at them (unless it's a note of some sort). The animations, rather slow and tedious, quickly become annoying, and you cannot skip them unlike in some other games of the similar genre.

It would probably be good for kids, but if you're an older gamer getting this game in a bundle or on sale is probably the way to go. So with that said, here are some pros and cons.PROS- Art style is quaint but unique and will probably age well because of that.- The idle animations in the foreground and background are entertaining enough.- Puzzles weren't too challenging but not necessarily hand-outs.- Does have bonus levels.- The mechanics are easy enough to get a handle on.CONS- The animations of the main character, though cute, may sometimes try your patience.- The story, simple though it is, is short and thus so is the game.- The differences between the bonus levels are cosmetic for the most part.- Just a pet peeve for me, the inventory automatically threw stuff out instead of letting the player figure out when an object was obselete. Probably not a con for most.- Not very replayable. You'll proabably do all you'll ever do on the first play-thru.So, all in all, it'll only take an hour or so to complete. I almost didn't recommend this game, but, all things considered, for what was offered you get pretty much what you might expect. And it's not like the game wasn't entertaining in its own rights, just don't expect to be playing it hours on end."

Just childish.Cons:- Puzzles: Too easy for my tase. No balance there to speak of, too easy for adventure gamers, too hard for kids.- Too short- Shallow experience4/10 I give it 4 for its cuteness and effort. But overall a shallow experience.

It is a great artistic challenge for the designers, since everything has to be told by actions and facial expressions; plus it opens up possibilities to include a plethora of details that would probably go unnoticed otherwise. In Gomo’s case these are small (or sometimes large) visual gags that are littered all over in every scene.The gameplay follows a room by room design, where you have to interact with scene elements and sometimes collect and use items to get to the other end of the screen. There are also a few more conventional puzzles here and there, but even with those Gomo is little more than an interactive cartoon. For adults at least. For small children it may act as a good educational software to teach common problem solving.Like most similar games, Gomo is short, 60 to 90 minutes long. But even at full price it costs about as much as a movie ticket, providing at least as much fun as a film would."

,Recommended,265330,22360686,"Posted: 11 April, 2016",all,novalinnhe,"TL;DR:Gomo is a short but sweet little adventure game, offering adorable graphics coupled with a silly story and very low puzzle difficulty. Best suited to younger gamers.Full Review:Gomo is a sweet little point-and-click adventure in which you control Gomo, a cuddly lil' dude who gets his pet dog stolen by a mean old alien overlord! The only chance of return for our poached pooch is a mysterious red crystal (naturally imbued with mystical powers of course), which our alien overlord is actually very happy to swapsies with us. So off we embark, on a quest to find this crystal thingy by any bizarre means necessary.Now while ""by any bizarre means necessary"" includes zipping down garbage chutes, out-smarting security robots and firing atomic warheads across alternate dimensions, Gomo's gameplay is actually highly linear, and the solution for how you're supposed to do all these crazy things is usually pretty straightforward. You also have just three inventory slots for objects (which are rarely used), and each ""scene"" will only offer one or two puzzles to solve - most of which you'll understand as soon as you see them. So I get the impression that Gomo is probably aimed at younger players, and reckon the last reviewer's description of it as an ""interactive animation"" has it spot on.I am personally a big fan of point-and-clicks, so I was happy enough playing through to the end and really enjoyed Gomo's silly humour. However, after a while I started to get frustrated with the character's movement. You often have to click multiple times simply to get Gomo to cross the scene, as he needs to be in precisely the right place for you to perform certain interactions. Because of this you're often left confused as to where your character should be standing simply to progress to the next area, even though you know exactly what to do. However I doubt children would be put off by this.All in all?If you see this game on sale and have a younger gamer or two to entertain, maybe pick it up for a rainy day. Otherwise I personally feel there are far better ""low difficulty"" point-and-click titles on Steam on the moment, such as Detective Grimoire, Broken Age, Samorost and so many others."

Puzzles are simplistic, and instead of being puzzling they are actually just frustrating. Much of the content is redundant, such as having a door and a button right next to that door to open that door. All this does is make the game more frustrating. The little cutscenes and animations are meant to be cute but instead they are annoying, they detract from the flow of the game, making the game a stuttering experience. One might argue that they are meant to be an eye candy, but it will take a whole lot more than just a few annoying instances of so-called ""eye candy"" to make this game look good. Overall, the metacritic score (currently 50) is a very accurate description of this game. Nothing to love but nothing to really hate. It is incredibly mediocre and definitely not worth the full asking price. I will enjoy deleting it from my computer after I am finished with it."

76561198036338106,Recommended,265330,14357032,"Posted: 6 February, 2015",all,smelliga,"After reading the reviews of this game, I waffled about picking it up, but I really wanted to give it a chance.  I love point and click adventures, I'm a fan of anything with aliens as a major plot device, and I really liked the art style.  Unfortunately, I can only halfheartedly recommend this game after experiencing it.The major problem I have with the game is the pacing.  For such a short game, you spend a great deal of time waiting.  There are unskippable cutscenes that are too long for the information they convey, and your character's action animations are incredibly slow.  The animation itself is cute and well-drawn, but it shouldn’t take longer to pick up an object and put it in your inventory than it does to walk to where you need to use that object and solve the puzzle.Additionally, the game initially gives you a sense of urgency with a countdown timer, making it appear like you have to rush, and then the game immediately and frustratingly takes away your control - the very next screen, your character starts playing around with random stuff in the scenery, wasting time.  Five minutes later, though, it doesn't even matter anymore because they seemingly throw the entire timer plot point out the window.Speaking of plot, nothing really made sense in this game.  Sure, you are questing after your kidnapped dog, who you can only free by recovering some sort of glowing crystal that the aliens want, but everything beyond that falls into the ""because we felt like it"" category (especially that WC scene).  Randomness is not necessarily a bad thing - there are some cute sight gags, and some of the crazy content is downright fun - just don't expect a coherent narrative.The item-based puzzles in this game are actually pretty straightforward, though.  Pick up a thing, walk a few inches, use thing.  Not too complicated.  The only aspect that might throw you off is the interface.  Each screen is programmed to act like an aggregate of smaller areas instead of a whole, so you will need to click on an excessive amount of movement arrows to access all of the individual sections.  Additionally, aside from light switches, the swirly ""interactable item here"" icon will usually only appear if you are within arm’s reach of the object.  Gameplay would have been greatly improved with the ability to smoothly walk across the screen, and with all of the interactables showing an indication on hover.The game contains a handful of mini-game puzzles that range from mildly interesting to exceedingly frustrating.  I actually had to look one up because I could tell that the colours were significant, but the puzzle as a whole was not intuitive.Another frustrating puzzle was the bonus content.  There are three unlockable bonus features to uncover over the course of the game.  Once you find the trigger in-game, the new content is permanently available from the main menu.  One of the keys is pretty obvious, but I found the other two to be easily overlooked.  I actually played through the game three separate times before I found them all; however, I didn't feel the payoff was worth it because they are basically three versions of the same thing.I played through with ""easy mode"" turned off, since most people said the game was not challenging enough.  I found out the only actual difference between the difficulty settings is that puzzle solution targets are not highlighted in hard mode.  This factoid is never explained within the game.Overall, I liked the game's art aesthetic and atmosphere.  Some of the humor was funny, there were a lot of amusing background details, and the main character was endearing.  I also liked many of the locations, and the puzzles were pretty decent for a short casual game.

A perfect game for young kids (3-8 years old) or folks new to gaming.  The point-and-click makes it easy to figure out what to do, and the toughest part about the puzzles is figuring out what aspects of the landscape are actually usable. The story line is basic; don't look for any deep meaning here. When played in one sitting, the mechanics and puzzles can feel a little boring, so I'd recommend this for your hangover days. It's a really nice Sunday morning game, and the credits are quite soothing. Not for folks looking for high action, and it may be too slow or simple for really experienced players."

There are puzzles and a couple of the solutions are kind of obscure, but there is a minimum of interaction (indeed, there is a minimum of content herein, but you can tell that it was made with love, if that means anything to you (not a charged statement, by the way, just a simple statement xD )).Good for a simple diversion. Do not expect too much at all.I recommend this game if you're a kid from the nineties that still enjoys those cartoons from your youth. Gomo has that sort of vibe to it (if not a little more juvenile); also, it is a tad like Salad Fingers (er actually Hubert Cumberdale), if the intent of Salad Fingers was to entertain kids, not crush souls."

The ""puzzles"" just don't cut it and surprisingly for a Daedalic game - which always have puzzles that are so convoluted there's no way you can solve them all without a walkthrough, this game was too easy. I'm glad I got this game at 90% off because frankly, it wasn't even worth the £0.39 I spent on it. It's so desperately trying to be a typical Amanita game without any narration or awkward voice acting (Daedalic's favorite thing if you didn't know) but the whole game suffers in return.

The character doesn't talk, so there is no help if you get stuck, the puzzles seem completely unrelated to the plot - why am I crushing rocks while my dog is missing? Nothing is particularly challenging, but it is convoluted and illigical.I could get over all of that though. It is the game mechanics that made me quit. The character's ambling slow movements drove me crazy from the very first click. Then, I discovered that clickables are only clickable if you are next to them, so i had to do three clicks to walk, waiting on the slow character, just to see if anything on the screen was clickable, and there doesn't seem to be a hot spot indicator. I found myself using a walkthrough almost immediately because I didn't have the patience to walk back and forth across the screen repeatedly. I won't be finishing this game.

It's only $5 at full price anyway, but it's really short (took me less than an hour and a half from start to finish) and there's not a lot to it. The main impression I got was that they wanted to make a cartoon but for some reason they were forced to make video game instead. It's fairly whimsical and things don't really happen for any particular reason, but the puzzles are easy enough that that's not frustrating. There are a couple of sliding tile puzzles that don't really fit the style of the other puzzles in the game, but they're not randomised or anything so you can just use a walkthrough (which I did).It reminded me a lot of Journey of a Roach, only not as good. The protagonist does speak, but rarely, and the dialogue is not important. Mostly you just press buttons and see what happens and then move on to the next screen. I was briefly stuck in a couple of places just because I couldn't work out what I was supposed to achieve, but most of the time there's not even really a puzzle, you just find the thing to click on. Sometimes you'll have to use an item from your inventory, but they're almost all one-use and given to you right where you'll need them.

I played the game again just to unlock the bonus minigames but it was just a waste of time as all three are slight variations of a ""whack-a-mole"" game.Overall the game is okay, but in my opinion it's the type of game you'd rather give to a 10 year old to keep them busy for a couple of hours."

Yet the interesting and beautiful surroundings cannot make up for a game that has the most linear gameplay I have ever experienced. It is just not much of a competition for any gamer who has played adventures before. One or two of the puzzles had me thinking, but mostly because I couldn't quite make out I could interact with something. Most of the time the competition was trying not too think in a too complicated way, schooled by adventures where every puzzle needs to be solved in more than just one screen.It is not all bad. As I said the surroundings are beautiful and you can see that a lot of love went into the game. Gomo is cute and I really wanted to help him... or her. The game definitely has its moments."

These games can be found ALL over the web, and again, for FREE. What I really don't mind, is that there's also bonus content. I can't get pass the code door with WC, cause some alien voice keeps telling me (I think that's what he says): Insert coin. All the good in game is, nice sketchy graphics, cute and ""fun"" game, and 3 trading card drops. Accoring to ALL the bad things, this game is rated by me:3/10. No, I don't reccomend it, sadly.
