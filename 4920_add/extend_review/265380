,Not Recommended,265380,12026349,"Posted: 8 September, 2014",all,Cyril,"I don't even know what to write on this one. It's so fundamentally mediocre that I don't feel anything towards it either way. It's entirely lacking in fun but there's not really much frustration to be had either. The enemies are a bit unfair since any hit is basically instant death. The puzzles are often anti-puzzles or otherwise pointlessly obscure. The game's not too terribly long (~4 hours the first time through for me) and it does a lot of different things, I guess. The art style's alright, kind of reminds me of Knytt Underground to some extent. The game wants to be LIMBO, also, with the atmosphere. The problem is that the narration... uhh... is unnecessary, and on top of that badly translated. Kind of ruins the plot, it's supposed to be dark and depressing but I'm giggling too much at the bad grammar. Also the ending is pretty stupid, you die, the end, you can't not die, so yay. Hope you had fun. But you probably didn't. I'm mostly rambling because I don't have many organized thoughts on this game. It's a game that exists but has no reason to."

It is an Indie game, and I will treat it as such.The developer markets Grimind as a horror/physics puzzle game, and that is about as descriptive as it gets. The gameplay is centered around completing the puzzles without any instruction or hand-holding. Not to say the puzzles are unsolvably difficult, but there are a few moments in which I scratched my  head in frustration and uttered a soft ""what the hell do I do?"" to my computer monitor. Once you get the feel of how the game operates, the puzzles start to become clear. The physics are also quite well done. I understand the developer reworked the inertia of objects and some other parameters for the game's Steam release, and the attention to detail shows. It seems more polished compared to early alpha footage (as one would expect). Objects can be picked up and thrown, liquids respond to disturbances, and soft-bodied pieces like vines move as they should.The strong point of the game is the lighting. Beautifully done point lights and both ""baked"" and active shadow casting as well as ambient gloom in certain points lends to a strong setting for a horror scenario. Many levels throw the character into the darkness with nothing but a lit torch, and as everything in the environment is opaque black, one understands that death may be around every turn.As for the ""scare factor?"" Some reviewers have thought the game is as frightening as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That is not necessarily true. The scariest part of the game is the environment itself. The player is pursued by malevolent little--welll--boxes (with no animation) that may only be vanquished with bright light. The enemy design is unbecomingly bland for a game that seems so well-put-together in every other regard. The chase sequences get one's heart pounding, but it is not fear. The character animation is perhaps a little poor as well.The sound work in the game is mixed. The background music/ambient noise are very impressive, and those elements are quite unsettling for the game. They chant at the player like spectral moans from an unknown source and never failed to cause my hair to stand on end. All other noises sound as though they were recorded by a desk mic in Audacity, like the growls of the monsters, drowning noises when underwater, and thunder of fallign boulders or objects. Their lack of quality just doesn't seem to fit, and they certainly didn't scare me.Lastly, the game's story and dialogue were originally written in Polish. (I believe?) The English translation is rough around the edges, but I could understand what was being conveyed with a little bit of pidgin translation. The story begins with no scenario, and ends with little more. It was more depressing of an end than a satisfying resolution. Perhaps there is a metaphorical message to it all? Nonetheless, I would have preferred to see a more complete story. Maybe in the sequel we can see more character development.I give this game 7.5/10. For what it was, I enjoyed every bit of it, but I also see room for polishing all around."

Without a single memory of his life or his place, the creature must navigate through a series of mysterious caves, strange mechanisms, and horrifying structures. Knowing he must remember to survive, he sets out to illuminate the darkness not just of the scary world around him, but of his very mind. In the immense darkness lurks something even more diabolical than simply not knowing who he is or what he is, for he is hunted. Red eyes and snarling screams echo off the cavern walls and pierce his very soul, shaking him to his core. Fear the dark, find relief in the light, and escaped the closing corners of your mind. Your Grimind."
,Recommended,265380,13942850,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Lunal,"tldr; Challenging but rewarding puzzle game, I really enjoyed it and the story line. Pay attention, be curious, and you'll have a blast. I'd highly recommend this if you like puzzle games that aren't easy! It's great!Fun game, very difficult puzzles in places but not ever impossible. I don't find myself getting truly frustrated most of the time, it's a lot of trial, error, death, and more trial. But the pace at which you achieve victory vs the time you spend dying on each puzzle feels nicely balanced, I only felt once or twice I had to stop and take a breather because of frustration, which is less than most other puzzle games I play.The mechanics are intuitive and easy to learn, even as they quite often throughout the course of the game throw new mechanics at you to use on more and more difficult puzzles. And I really feel proud of myself when I finally beat a puzzle or learn to use a new mechanic.The story line is pretty good too, considering puzzle platformers don't tend to have much in the way of plot, so that was a nice surprise. I really like the main character."

The atmosphere and sound are wonderful, but it lacks anything else to make it good. The controls are basic, the physics sometimes go crazy, the grammar is weird at some points, and there is no plot whatsoever. That's what really disappointed me about this game. You don't know what you are, who you are, and by the end, none of those questions are answered. You don't even know the motive of the little ghost thing that helps/hinders you. At the end, I was completely disappointed in this game."

Who you are, what are you doing there, where is  exit.  You don't need that. Jump, fight, run. The game generates even more questions and don't give answers.Maybe not to bother and play only as platformer.Level design is very poor. Just stupid dark tunnels. The level design will not change from beginning to the end. Even playing in the mind of creature, we can't find any difference with other levels.Audio- same thing.Last fight with friend -really аwful, frustrating thing.All gamers, who expect a lot from a storyline, amazing indie, and horror story just pass by.There was a promising idea here but nothing in the game came together to make for an interesting experience.

I've had this in my library for ages but only just got around to playing it through - I'd previously played the first level and thought it was alright, but perhaps something worth coming back to. Well, now I have. And I'm glad I did.The graphics aren't great and the controls take some getting used to...but the sound design is excellent, and the puzzles are well put together, with plenty of variety - the game is always introducing new tricks and abilities to avoid repeating itself too much.Despite the bad grammar and the lack of explanation, I really did end up feeling for the little guy...and the ending was kind of sad :("
,Recommended,265380,17617999,"Posted: 19 August, 2015",all,Benny Banana Bread,"I hate platformers. Over 200 deaths. Frustrating. Pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Tedious. On the plus side, there are frequent checkpoints so you don't have to start each level over from the beginning. The sounds and visuals are very cool. Very cool. The lighting is amazing. Regardless, I hate platformers and have no idea why I play them. If you like platformers then I highly recommend this game. I'm having difficulty recommending the game because it was so frustrating but it's advertised as a platformer so I suppose I should recommend it.Pros: Sounds (not really music), lighting, unique platformer, frequent checkpoints.Cons: It's a platformer so it's incredibly frustrating."
,Recommended,265380,13222512,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,Lagg,"Before I start the review proper I just want to mention that it'srichthat the people part of this community that gave Goat Simulator overwhelming positive reviews and got Grass Simulator on Steam because they're stupid enough to be bribed with keys think they have any right to judge a game with barely a plot harshly. Really amusing.Anyway, yes the plot is thin. Annoyingly so. I didn't get to see just what kind of creature the protagonist was nor why he was there and the ending was basically a downer of epic proportions similar to Hellraiser but from the start it was quite obvious this would be one of those ""The journey is the story"" games. I'm pretty sure that the ending is intentional since the game has ""Grim"" in its name though.Otherwise as far as gameplay goes I'm in love with it for similar reasons I was in love with Amnesia and Penumbra. The physics and world interactivity is awesome. So is the lighting (Those warm and cool color combinations look so damn pleasing to the eye).  I'm not really one that cares much for puzzles but in this case I just like seeing physics objects bounce around and there's plenty of that here. Kind of makes one wonder where the complaints are coming from since if I can manage to negotiate a puzzle in a game I'm pretty sure anyone else can.The game is also technically interesting because of the engine the author wrote. It's a really simple one that just uses SDL, Bullet for the physics and TGA based sprites. I love it when people do stuff like this. So easy to just squeeze out a turd with Unity these days so it's extremely refreshing to see someone take a design and make it their own from the bottom up. This sort of thing is exactly what makes me remember the good times I had in my gamedev stints and makes me want to get back to it.I did a series on ithere. Beware though, there's a whole lot of complaining from me about the morons that infest this community in it."

It's a somewhat interesting indie title, which is clearly not done with a massive amount of money, and I tried not to raise my expectations too high. And I didn't. But it still wasn't that good, and towards the end I just wanted it to end already. And that's not a good sign.Grimind is supposedly a puzzle platformer, and there are plenty of puzzles indeed. Some are really good, but some are based more on the 'platformer' thingy and the game, meaning that it depends more on you're timing and pressing the right key at the right time, rather than you're puzzle-solving skills. The controls of Grimind were basically alright but not 100% fluid, and this fact together with some level-design decisions made me often get to a point of feeling nervous and irritated as I simply couldn't get through a certain section of the game, again and again and again... Until it stopped being and fun.I could forgive this, though, but unfortunately there wasn't much to keep me intrigued and motivated to actually want to finish this game, aside for a slight curiosity about how the story would end, and my terrible tendency to finish whatever game I play even if I don't enjoy it.So, I did finish the game, and unfortunately I didn't reach any satisfying conclusion to the game. Found out the I missed one secret and that finding all the secrets in the game would grant me an additional ending.Went to look for that missing secret, made it to the ending again, and got an even less satisfying conclusion.Grimind presents you questions and wanderings throughout the entire game but leaves you with no answers, no real conclusion, no real story.So, unfortunately, awkward story + awkward gameplay equals not such a good experience.And that's a shame, because Grimind does show potential, there were some entertaining moments, the game had a brilliant sound design which fit the creepy atmosphere, the graphics are very simple and yet captivating, dark and gloomy and yet colorful.This indie title does have some good features and could be really enjoyable if it only wasn't getting so tedious as the game progresses. It is rather short though, so you could probably get it on a massive sale if you really like this type of things."
,Recommended,265380,30026904,Posted: 18 February,all,Cornelia Xaos,"A quirky but very enjoyable platformer experience.  As my play time no doubt reveals, it doesn't take very long to get to the end of the game AND 100% completion.  (There's a guide.. but it's much more rewarding if you just get yourself killed over and over until you find all the secrets.)The English might be a bit off for some of the ""dialogue"" but that's okay as it didn't really feel offputting or hard to understand.The puzzles, while few, are nicely done and if you're a fan of the Puzzle Platformer genre you'll probably enjoy the six or so hours you spend playing this.All in all, would recommend."
