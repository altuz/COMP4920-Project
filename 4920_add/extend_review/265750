,Recommended,265750,10462824,"Posted: 13 June, 2014",all,FreakOrama,"Secret Ponchos is a top-down shooter that looks great, plays great, and has a nice multiplayer. The game has 4 characters in total in the current version of the game with only a few maps to play in, a practice mode, and 2 multiplayer modes. and I'm pretty sure they will add more as time goes on, but this early version (first public version) of the game and it feels great and my purchase is in good hands. From what i can see there will be single-player, split screen gameplay, and maybe coop. But at the moment, if you won't be satisfied with only multiplayer, i'd advise to wait a month or two, but if you don't mind it then go right ahead and get it, it doesn't seem that buggy and fun to play honestly. Plus the art style and the music are really awesome in this game that gives you a feeling of the old west in a cartoon-ish way. Also, these guys are 'good guys devs' , they have PS4 Dual Shock 4 Support for the game on PC. Massive plus.http://youtu.be/dhri5MxDs6IWill update when the coop mode / split-screen mode is out, and when the KB/M controls are out.UPDATE: From what the developers are saying, the 'Coop' is team vs. team multiplayer, there is no coop where you and your friend play against AI in a horde mode or single-player. That's really bad and false advertising if that is actually the case.The developers see 'coop' as a competitive team vs. team multiplayer as the main definition of the term 'coop' , and such, they do not have the coop that we know as player vs. AI, but they also said that they are not rulling that out, at the moment they are focusing on the multiplayer side of things until launch and may add a singleplayer to the game with a probability of adding team vs. AI.Devs took the advice and feedback, and will hopefully remove the coop tag from the store page, and will update when it's actually removed (It's removed :) ). So when they do actually add coop, first of all that would be great, secondly then they would add the coop tag in the game's store page. Hurray for polite and constructive criticism.More info here:KSalue"

It's a crazy fun top-down, western themed, pvp class-based shooter. I have tons on fun with it, and I can see many others sharing the same feeling. However, its small playerbase has kept it from becoming something amazing. Now would be the best time to play, as the more people play, the more the devs will add to the game. Great game to play with friends. Hell, hit me up if you need someone to play with."
,Recommended,265750,16155842,"Posted: 3 June, 2015",all,Captain Walrus,I primarily want to write this review because a lot of older negative reviews are just outdated.Over the last months the developers  improved the game a lot for example with over 500 fixes (including many matchmaking fixes) and keyboard and mouse support :).In my opinion the outlaws are balanced now and every outlaw feels really different to play with.Secret Ponchos is also way beginner friendlier now because there is a new AI practice mode where you can basically play with bots ( of course theyre still a little dumb but really helpful to learn combos and stuff :D). Also the importance of perk points (points you get while levelling up to improve your outlaws stats) has been reduced massively so even a player with the lowest rank has a chance against players with the highest rank. Additionally a tutorial has been added and an in game lobby chat where new players can e.g. ask more experienced players for tips.Another really good thing about this game is that it is really easy to communicate with the devs. They stream Secret Ponchos weekly and talk with the community about changes and future plans on the live stream.The gameplay is really competitive. The art style and the music are just awesome. So just give the game a shot (whether it will be with Deserters bayonet or The Killers revolver ;) ).See you out there in Lonetree :DUpdate: All the new content that has been added in the Most Wanted Edition makes this game even better and I think everyone should be able to find an outlaw that fits his playstyle because there are 10 unique outlaws now.

There are 5 characters who are pretty well balanced for early access. The gameplay itself is simple to learn and has a lot of depth. I can easily spend hours playing this game without getting bored. Whether you win or lose entirely depends upon how you play (or if there's a glitch or bug; this is Early Access after all).This game has a multiplayer aspect that rivals putting quarters in Street Fighter 2. This is a game where you and your friends will murder each other repeatedly and they will have a good time doing it. Unfortunately, there is no single player, and very few people right now are willing to spend the time to set up a game.If you enjoy competitive games, this is an absolutely amazing game that you must own. If you have the patience to wait in the chat or set up a game with other people, I would recommend this game to you. If you don't have friends, you might want to reconsider buying this. If you don't have any patience, you should pick a different game entirely because this one will mercilessly crush you."

,Recommended,265750,19701775,"Posted: 14 December, 2015",all,Barricadas,"This is going to be a simple pros and cons list:Pros:- Game's aesthetic design is lovely and the wild west theme is applied pretty decently.- Characters are fitting and unique enough but they haven't created personalities and taunts for them which could make the player feel more attached to characters.- The thing I hated the most about MOBAs, limiting the game for only one map is not apparent here and most of the maps feel authentic enough.- All characters have three unique powers which are all fitting to the characters but some of them are useless imo, like The Deserter's impale attack as it takes too long to charge and easy to miss.- Game feels unique at every aspect.Cons:- The game's playerbase is really small. I guess the Steam free weekend is to combat that problem, but at the first day of the free weekend, I still have troubles finding a game.- Balance is non existant. But this might not be the game's fault but the low playercount's, as the Steamspy statistics show.- This is only my own opinion but if the game had higher damage and scattered healing stations (it could be wells or travelling doctors to fit the aesthetic)- There are some weird angles that you can't see where you are or where you're aiming at.- A simple color change to aiming line, making it bright red instead of faded black would drastically improve playability.- More objective based modes instead of deathmatch or domination would improve the tactical side of things.- Steam workshop for characters and maps could do wonders to increase the community forming and involvement alongside with cosmetic drops and marketplace instead of buying skins directly from the developer.- There is no form for team chat.This game is not good enough right now, but there are some simple changes that could make it my go to multiplayer game, I hope the developers continue developing and not be downhearted by low player count.I am recommending you all this game as it is now free and if you want to continue playing, it's cheap enough. I wish they also put 4-pack to the sale so it would see a greater increase in population.Edit after couple more hours: The game certainly has enough depth and gets better when you start playing with the guys that use their outlaws creatively. Three The Kid dynamite ♥♥♥♥ fest? YOU GOT IT! Deserter tank, phantom kill? For sure mate! It's 6 A.M here now and I don't want to sleep to continue playing the game, I haven't felt this about a game since Skyrim."
,Recommended,265750,18920664,"Posted: 6 November, 2015",all,The Lunar Child,"Secret Ponchos tries and succeeds to bring something that feels fresh to the table: great gameplay with a few different game modes and maps, strong and unique spaghetti western theme, well balanced and designed characters and a caring community.The devs are really active and friendly (you can easily find them on the community chat and boards), and the game is regularly patched.Right now, I think the major issue is the lack of players at certain hours (obviously depending from your region) that can make quite hard finding matches at times. Also, the menus/UI are quite counterintuitive.Long story short, this is a great game that only needs a bigger playerbase. If it strikes your fancy you won't regret buying it, expecially if you can bring your own posse to the fray."

They confirmed new characters and skins will be added in the future as DLC, but no player will have an advantage by spending more money in the game. There's even a chance we'll have every character unlocked on practice mode, so we can try before we buy and who doesn't love that?♥ Controller + Mouse and Keyboard SupportJust pick what you prefer and rebind if needed!♥ Constant UpdatesCurrently, they'll release major content updates every week until full release, can't wait!♥ SupportFor an indie studio, they are freaking amazing. You can see 3 employees constantly active in the group chat answering questions and setting up matches to play with everyone.♥ CommunityRight now it's honestly very small, but solid. We meet up every night to play, discuss and welcome new players. I've personally invited at least 10 players to the group in just a few days after the June 02 update to spread the word even more.☹ BalanceThe game still needs some balancing tweaks so any character can win against the rest with enough practice. After trying the game for the first time 10 months ago, this has been greatly improved. Developers are open to feedback and constantly tweaking the characters, so I think having a balanced game on release is possible.☹ AnimationsStill needs improvement. Being a competitive multiplayer game, this needs to be especially polished. I can feel the animations are sloppy sometimes and the gameplay doesn't have the flow it should have. The game isn't finished yet, so I can understand this and hope it's one of their priorities.TL;DRHighly recommened, see you at the gun fight! (conclusion in the comments area)"

That can seem scary at first for inexperienced players, and you may get your face melted a few times as you learn, but it's infinitely more engaging once you get the hang of it, and more satisfying when you finally nail a game-changing shot.The character classes all seem very well-balanced, and they accommodate the full range of play styles. You can run-and-gun, snipe, charge into melee, or play defense, and you can be pretty successful at any of them if you learn how to do it right.  There's also plenty of synergy between different classes, so even an OK team can pull off effective combos.Maps are solid--enough space to maneuver but not enough that anyone disappears. The game could probably use another play mode or two, but the current ones have been enough to keep me busy.Art style is... Well, take a look! It's beautiful. It's fun to watch even when your team's getting rolled, it almost it feel less painful.And if you want dev support, you really can't beat it. Devs are in the chatroom for about half of every day.Only thing that the game's been struggling with is its population... From what I hear, before the free week it was a ghost town, much like the in-game visuals. But a lot of people like myself joined for the free week and have decided to stay for the long haul, so the population issue is gradually ironing itself out. US matchmaking is good until about pre-dawn, EU is creeping upward, and Down Under is the only region that still needs a helping hand. But we're only halfway through with the promo as I type this and haven't even reached the weekend yet, so there's nowhere to go but up.Final Note: The community that's already here has only a hint of salt in it... You get some overlap from the rest of the Interwebz, and there will be the occasional n00bs14y3r,  but nothing even CLOSE to the level that you'd expect from Dota2, LoL, etc. This may change as the game continues to grow, but right now it's in a pretty comfy place."

It looks like a traditional MOBA at first glance, but relies heavily on reflex and twitch actions. The game has a lot of character; music, design, and art direction are all executed well, adding a certain level of polish one does not expect. Gameplay rewards a player who can read situations well and coordinate actions with teammates. The classes are all fairly balanced as well, maybe not the case in a 1v1 scenario, but most definitely in a 2v2 scenario.Currently the game modes are narrow, and finding a game can sometimes take awhile due to the low population. These issues have not cut into my own enjoyment of the game. The game does have a number of glitches that can become annoying and affect one's performance. I will note that after one day of owning the game patches have corrected several glitches I had been experiencing. The game is not optimized to run on the PC, also. These are all problems that are currently being adressed by the creators of the game.Buying an early access game is always somewhat terrifying when perusing through Steam's catalog.

Being a Referee at EVO 2015 decided to take a break and ended up playing this game for hours. This game had people screaming with excitement and suspense. The mechanics are easy to get used to, around 2-3 games. Once you get the mechanics down you can branch from multiple characters to chose from all with their own awesome abilities.What I enjoy the most is the combos you can land with each character. It's not a game where some characters counter others or some are stronger. It is all about skill and how you use your stamina bars. Some one can land a combo without taking any damage while another can miss that combo and end up losing a chunk of their health. The characters are balanced, all are unique, and all have their mechanics to understand and combos.This game is by far my top 5 indie/ video game. If you want to play just join the awesome community or seatch for a game. Everyone seems to be friendly here. give it a shot. Im going to buy some extra keys and give away on my streams on Twitch come check it out."

So let me discuss the good, the bad and the ugly that this game has to offer.First of all it should be said that the game is a lot of fun, and for that reason alone I can recommend it.  It is challenging, skill based and seems pretty well ballanced. The devs actively engage with the community and are open to suggestions. And contrary to a claim by a certain well known reviewer, the game does have a practice mode where you can try each of the outlaws either in a free for all brawl against 3 AI opponents, or in the same level with said opponents disabled.Now despite the goodness this game has to offer it is not without its flaws. The settings available at this point in time can be rather lacklustre for some players, and the community is small enough to make matchmaking a bit of a hassle at times, particularly on slow days. The matchmaking issues also mean that it is harder to get teams of around the same skill level, although a recent patch has tried to alleviate that by trying to shuffle (non-premade) teams so that they are more even, rank wise. Still this system isn't always 100% effective, as one of the first matches I played after the patch was implemented shows. Another (rather) experienced player and myself got matched up against a pair of new players.Overall I recommend you give it a try, though it might take you more than the 2 hours that steam allows for a refund in order to get into the game. If you're worried about the population you can buy the four pack for a few dollars* more, and gift some spare copies to your friends. That way you're at least assured of a few 2v2 matches.*Or other currencies that don't make for good spagetthi western puns.EDIT: As a sad fact the community has been on the low side for a while now. Though it makes the community feel like a gaming clan at times, it also makes finding pick up games difficult.But don't fear, the Devs are still hard at work on the game, and still stream every saturday, During these streams the community joins in for a few games. The community also still has duels and small matches during the week in the form of private matches."

Ojisan Forme,"A very smooth and beautiful game set in the wild west, featuring stereotypical gunmen battling for outlaw and vigilante supremacy. Secret Ponchos is a top-down team shooter based around spacing and aiming, with emphasis on the different characters' weapons rather than skills. Fights are quick and snappy, with players having to take aim at the opposing team while simultaneously dodging and weaving through the rain of bullets they're putting down. Combining the strengths of the different Outlaws affects the outcome in many ways, ensuring that there is no real ""optimal"" team.Visually, the game is stunning. The outlaws and environments are perfect in the classic west setting. The outlaws themselves are stylized in a very dark, cartoonish way that fits the game's theme. Each of them are statistically and visually different from one another so that you can always tell the group apart.The soundtrack is phenominal, sounding exactly as though it was from a classic spaghetti western film. It never feels intrusive or like just background noise. The guitars and trumpets flaring up press you forward subconciously, adding drama and intensity to your gunfights as you both linger on the verge of death.All in all, Secret Ponchos is one of the best team shooters I've played, and I reccomend it to anyone who digs wild west games or movies."

76561198109871880,Recommended,265750,16229878,"Posted: 6 June, 2015",all,(twitch.tv/)Aphrenics,"I'll be writing this review from the standpoint of a competitive gamer that mainly opts to play competitive, multiplayer games. I mention this, because there is no single player mode in this game to speak of. This leads me to believe this game is being developed exclusively as a competitive game, and as such has not a lot to say when it comes to variety. If you're looking for a game that has six hundred maps, fifty different game modes, raids, mounts, pets, or any of that stuff then this game is not for you. At least not yet. Who knows what they have planned.That being said, if you're the type of person that likes to play arena style games akin to Bloodline Champions, and are okay with there *CURRENTLY* being a lack of variety in maps, modes, and characters, then buy this game right now. This game is a blast even if you're not trying to top the leaderboards or compete at all. There is a ranked and unranked queue you can join and play with or against your friends in.The devs for the game are very social, and active within the community. They are constantly working to improve the game, and want to make the best game they can. This alone makes the game worth checking out if you're tired of your voice just not being heard when you talk about other games you play. Now we'll get to the numbers.Art: 9/10The only reason I give this a 9/10 instead of a 10 is because I realize the art style may not be for everyone. This is a very stylized game, and personally I think the art itself and the style its presented in is superb. The animation is very slightly lacking when things are viewed from up close, but the game is a treat to look at from when you boot it up to when you shut it down. The character, or ""outlaw"" designs are quite varied so far, thus there is a pretty good chance there's an outlaw for you in the roster.Sound / Music: 8/10Again, something I would rate higher if not for one minor thing. The sound and music are both excellent, however there is an issue with the very blatant looping of the menu music. I don't notice it much anywhere else, but there are currently issues concerning a lack of fluidity between songs. Overall the music is very thematic, fitting to a T, and serves its purpose very well.UI: 7/10The interface is currently suffering the most of any category right now in my opinion, however I do also realize that this is mostly by virtue of it being a console port. Issues with the chat being behind part of the overlay after a match, or overlapping of text on the main menu are prevalent but do not detract greatly from the experience. Most of the issues are minor at worst if anything more than cosmetic. It does what it was meant to do though, and is easy to navigate through to find what you're looking for.Gameplay: 9.5/10I won't speak on balance here because I am not good enough at the game to see what's too good right now. What I will say, is that it all feels good. Combat so fluid it turns water green, characters that are all strong in different ways, a strong focus on mechanical skill rather than cooldown counting and mana crunching, and a simultaneously simple and complex gameplay experience all make up for one of the most fun and exciting competitive games I've played in a long time. The gameplay itself is basic, but complex at the same time due to the human element. The only gripes I have with the game are extremely minor, and consist of little things or things already being worked on like the lack of characters, more of which are already being developed. Other tiny complaints would be things like sometimes if you mash the aim button too much, your character gets locked into the aiming stance, but only graphically so you really aren't hindered at all. Even then, it resets if you just stop mashing it and move around.There are tiny glitches similar to that scale around the game, but do not let that deter you from doing yourself the favor of buying this game. I simply cannot recommend this game highly enough to anyone who plays games competitively, or even to someone who is just competitive. It's a blast, and you will not regret picking it up. It's only getting better with time."

You dodge role and hide behind cover while reloading. It gets really intense, because aside from one character, there is no healing.

The atmosphere is extremely well done.The game has 10 fun, unique characters who each have their own skills and abilities. Once you get good enough you can even pull off some rewarding combos too!There are 3 game modes right now.Deathmatch- Stay alive, because you only get one life per round.

76561198022680929,Recommended,265750,18190652,"Posted: 25 September, 2015",all,bobandcharley,"Secret Ponchos is just THE RIGHT game for me, and it is extremely likely that you will LOVE IT too!1. Idea and DeliveryImagine yourself as Clint Eastwood walking into a deserted city in one of the movies in ‘The Man with No Name’ Trilogy by Sergio Leone. See yourself pulling a revolver and trying to aim at your opponent while he dashes to the side and tries to smoke you with a Molotov cocktail. Well, that is what Secret Ponchos is about.The gameplay reminds me of the simpler times. Do you remember the sheer enjoyment of those good old Atari games that kept you glued to the screen for hours at a time? Secret Ponchos is a spirit child of those classic ancestors. It retains the intensity of engagement and simple but immersive mechanics.3D cartoon graphics and subtle western instrumental in the background amplify the enjoyment of the game. Switchblademonkeys managed to produce a renaissance-like game by going back to the good old basics – fun experience, fair but unforgiving gameplay dynamics, with intense but humor-infused light-hearted competitive element. It is very likely that at some point it time, you will be blown to pieces by Kid Red at the last moment of a really tight match, while he simultaneously rubs it in – ‘TAKE THAT!’2. Gameplay DynamicsSecret Ponchos is game of dynamic paper-rock-scissors across 5 or 6 different dimensions – damage, moving speed, stamina, health, reload speed and range. Each character possesses some innate traits, two different weapons, and there is even a mini-element of RPG game allowing you to adjust the first 5 of 6 aforementioned characteristics.The action is fast-paced and interactive. It amounts to tricking your opponent into making a mistake. You will need to anticipate your opponents’ move before making your own to be a great player at this game. In addition, you will need nimble fingers to sort through a variety of well-designed moves and combos each character has.3. Depth, Versatility and Balance of CharactersIn general, each character possesses two different weapons with at least two different types of attacks for each weapon. The depth and RPG element of the game, whereby you will be able to give a boost to some of your attributes as you gain experience, is perfectly suited for the ‘The God, The Bad and The Ugly’ type of confrontations. But do not be mistaken each attribute point will count. If you doubt me, play as Killer against Matador and adjust the speed attribute differently in each match.Each character is unique and will provide a very different experience of the game and will require you to craft and use very distinct strategies in addressing various opponents. For example, a Killer has two weapons, revolver and a knife, which he can use in 4 standard and 1 three-part combo attacks. Each attack has unique characteristics and provides plenty of debt to serve most of the matches that will rarely exceed 5-7 minute timeframe.Some characters will be harder to play than others, but no character will turn a bad player into a good one or a good player into a bad one. Imagine that you are playing pool and someone gives you a slightly better cue. You may sink few more shots but you will still be unable to play in the top league.4. CommunityI do not think that this review would be complete without mentioning the incredibly supportive Secret Ponchos community. My interaction with them began when I emailed SwitchBladeMonkeys on February 13, 2015 and received a reply from Yousuf Mapara the very same day. SBM team is effectively smaller than a dozen of people. The amount of commitment they showed to the players is incredible. Join the PC game chat and see for yourself. You can see them on a Twitch each Saturday morning as well.5. Post-Game ExperienceThis is a category I don’t see but I think it should be included in game reviews.Remember that feeling you had when playing Diablo for 8-hours straight, just repetitively left and right-clicking the screen in hope that you will be the lucky one bestowed with a legendary item drop. Remember that absurd, tired and angry feeling that overwhelmed you when you finally managed to turn off the computer and ask yourself – ‘What have I done with my day?’Secret Ponchos is a game that will never make you feel that way. You will be able to play short, fun, engaging and interactive matches. Personally, I can’t spend hours on gaming. However, that doesn’t prevent me from enjoying this game to the fullest. I can play for 15-20 minutes at a time, put it aside, have a dinner with my wife or entertain guests shortly after without feeling exhausted.6. Price – At 16.99 for one or 49.99 for a pack of four games this is one of the most affordable games with incredible replay value on the market. Enough said!I hope you liked the review and I also hope to see you on the other side of the Saloon – colt and I will be waiting! I also can’t wait to try the new characters – Warmonger, Mad Trapper, and Gunman.P.S. I would like to apologize, this was a lengthy post.P.P.S. I base my feedback on the following experience in the game, which I started playing in January 2015:Killer – 974 matches; 2,293 kills; 272K in bounty (106K deathmatch; 272K domination);Hunter – 131 matches; 401 kills; 51K in bounty;Kid Red – 57 matches; 219 kills; 27K in bounty;Gordo – 22 matches; 90 kills; 10K in bounty;"

As a Texan born and raised on Spaghetti Westerns and who was also named after John Wayne characters this game really strikes at the heart with me. So much nostalgia strikes and the soundtrack makes me want to listen to country ballads. But beyond all that heartwarming nonsense there is a very well made and engaging game here. All the characters have a strong sense of individuality with their own playstyles to boot. The gunplay is inuitive and fun and all the maps provide a fresh place for strategy. I feel as though this game has a strong amount of potential and its current community is simply thriving with closeness and determination.In conclusion, this game is well worth your money.

If there is a game with involved and active devs who seek to improve their product, it's Secret Ponchos.While it's true that there are still things that need improvement, like matchmacking and latency issues, it has to be understood that this is a very small team that has achieved something that would already seem impossible to have been created by said small team. The quality of Secret Ponchos is incredible - much more than most indie games out there (it always bothered me that most indie games used that tag as an excuse to make 'old school' pixel games). The Music is top notch, and for a lot of us Early Access players, it was something we constantly commented on and loved. Character Designs are comic book characters come to animated life.I won't describe the actual game, as by now most readers will already know the basic theme of it. In short, it's a Western MOBA, but one of its kind really. It rewards precission and mastering of your particular Outlaw, while not relying on minmaxing with items etc, making skill really shine out in ranked matches. It's simple, but the core of the game stands on its own two feet.Right now the player base is small but loyal. For a lot of people who want a big faceless community, this will be a problem. But the beauty of Secret Ponchos from the start was being able to talk and have fun with the guys you were constantly shooting at, and improving side by side. There's obviously many more players since, but that feeling of camaraderie is still there.All in all, great game with minor set backs. Nothing that won't make you start a new match."

76561198087244243,Recommended,265750,19726386,"Posted: 16 December, 2015",all,Iron Kaiser,"--The PROS--The gameplay is a fast, action packed romp. Once you get the hang of the controls, you'll really feel like you're in a wild west shootout. There's nothing quite like ducking for cover just in time to miss a shotgun blast, or making a sudden dive and wheeling around just in time to blow away your foe. The interactivity with the environment is great, and adds an extra layer to the action.The aesthetic of the game is fantastic. The music has the perfect mix of compelling western flair with just enough modern spice. The characters are vibrant and evocative, as are the locales. The SFX are solid too; landing the final shot that ends a tough duel sounds as good as it feels.--The CONS--The game's single-player options are very limited. This is effectively an online multiplayer game only. Indeed, it feels like the multiplayer options also have a lot of room for expansion (4v4 or 5v5, more maps and modes). The game takes some getting used to, and the tutorial does a mediocre job of preparing the player (definitely will need to play a few real rounds before you really get it). Also, there are the occasional bugs in the menu and matchmaking that can be an inconvenience (though they're not really significant).Secret Ponchos is a short shot of frenetic fun.

Even if you only know the very basics of the game, you're still guaranteed to have a blast, just as I did. That said, there's alway more to learn and improve on, so the gameplay never feels stale, and every play that you pull off feels immensely rewarding, since everything is a skillshot, and there's always a cost to using any ability. I'm honestly blown away by how much fun I've been having. A friend of mine recommended this game really highly to me, and I like it way more that I thought I would. Even so, I did recognize that this game has a pretty small playerbase...But we can easily fix that by getting more people to play with us!Buy this game.

I've only played it a couple times when it wasn't even support mouse in this game. But still, the game experience attracted me to wait for its development and the release of its full potential. The only problem this game is facing is not having too many players at the moment. This doesn't mean that the game is dead since it also runs on consoles. Plus, I've contacted the development team and they told me that the game is about to be fully launched into steam, which means a huge boost of population coming soon.When the game gets out of early access, this is definitely a worthy buy if the population of the game can maintain at a stable amount. The combat system and the graphics are very good, style of the game is nice and etc. Only one thing I've not that satisfied was there's only 2v2 available.

Im running on controller, so my experience is a bit different than others, but from what I have seen the controller controls (feels weird putting those words next to each other) are solid.Secret Ponchos is a pretty good game in my opinion. The aim, while a bit slippery for me on controller, is smooth and responsive while shooting at someone. Matches are full of action and the gameplay is great. Graphics wise everything is actually pretty cool when you play it for yourself. The maps are well made and the art style is unique to most games out there in my opinion. Character designs and playstyles make each one stick out from one another providing very different ways to play depending on who you choose to play as. The solo practice is a great way to learn and try each of the characters to find which best suits you.For those saying that it is hard to find a game, it's best to look on the discussion forum for the game and find the best times to play. If you play during those recommended times you are usually guarenteed to find a lot of matches.One final note, the community for this game, while small, is actually one of the nicest communities I have run into for a game. Everyone in the group chat and on the forums is very helpful, informative, and willing to help anyone that has any problems with their experience.Secret Ponchos is only in early access at the moment of this review but it is honestly one of the best early access games I have played with it's solid gameplay and great community.

In Domination, you compete to move a kill marker to your side.  Each kill moves your marker closer to your victory.  Of course, the enemy team is doing the same, so it's quite the fight.Your ranks are stored per character, so while I may have Kid Red ranked up a few times (with obligatory stat point investiture) my rank with The Killer remains at 0 - so you have to use each Outlaw if you really want to have a full arsenal of options - but if you like your character and don't want to change, then there's no reason to, since you're not hurting yourself in any way.The battles are fast and fierce, and you aren't extremely durable, so you're always wondering if the next fracas will be your last.It's a game that absolutely MUST be played."

The gaming community is much too large for any game to create such a blatant gap in capability between those who have played a lot and those who have only just touched the game. After about an hour of game time I seem to be able to go toe-to-toe with anybody near my 'level'. However the damage numbers and stamina recharge time as a starting player is terribly inferior to those who have logged tons of game hours. Granted I understand you can reach those levels, but every time you lose a match, you also lose your cash. This is not the best system to draw in more players. And speaking of more players... this game needs it... bad. The que times and stat differences between players make for a very displeasing experience.Despite all the bad the game really is pretty for what it is, and the characters are obviously thematic and not just copies of eachother. The gameplay is fun unless you find yourself trying to manage the cover mechanics. I'm sure volume control will come with the platform shift, but until then we'll have to struggle with frustrating volume and controllers.All in all. Here's what I score it.Art: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Outlaw Balance: 4/10Multiplayer Interraction: 2/10Addicting: 7/10Overall: 6.5/10Worth the buy if on sale or if you have four friends who want to try something new.

It rewards you for playing a lot of matches not for being good.Soo.. outside of that devs are really nice and listen to community. The only downside is that they will probably never fix the net code. They've only said that they consider making regional locks but IT WILL NOT FIX THE LAG PROBLEM it only reduces the amount of laggers.

In this game there are a good amount of advantages for those who  wanna play 2/3 spesific outlaws, if you use those 2/3 outlaws there is no way to lose, not skill and not time (even tho time also means new patches and updates) can fix that problem if you face them.One of the first outlaws I tried was ""The Wolf"" or something similar. The bow has little dmg, but a pro is long range, but range doesnt really matter much when there is evade in a game (you have to consider the charge time for that range too).The second ability is a prone mode where you have a dagger and you can charge someone and you have more speed to move with, but the instant you try to charge or jump someone you're faced with another charge up time and you are so slow that catching up with someone is impossible. At this you might say I could just run up and jump him as if he doesn't have time just evade and run away. Now if he doesn't run away he can always just shoot you once and you willl have to do the charge up time again. Yeah I think it's starting to sink in now. So you  have one ability taht you can rely on and it was almost no dmg. The other is a interruptable ability that does good dmg, but is impossible to do if you're up against someone over 12. The Kid can just empty his rounds into you without moving a muscle and you're dead.Conclution: Get El Matador, The Kid and Gonzo, you'll never lose (you could switch El Matador with The Phantom) and have fun winning everything for the few hours you waste in this game. Otherwise get a game where the odds are equal and it's interesting to see who is the better, not who wanna spam ""The Killcombo"" the most.Legend out."

But i had to on this one.First of all they advertise this game as a game of skill , where every shot counts.  well that is false,All the game ends up is either both teams charging at each other every match , or one team that just runs the entire match , but mostly it is just run towards each other and and smother , and it never changes , gets old real quick , its like counter strike , but not near as good , and counter strike is not good. Just two teams running at each other, And far as the skills go , well you have around 3 of those and get old real quick. And as far as a persons ""skill"" affecting the game? Not really , pretty much charge and button mash will do , thats what pretty much everyone does.Another thing i found that i did not like is , after just a couple hours of play your toon has to move to ranked play.  You dont even have time to get a feel for your toon and your playing ranked, its just silly , Overall , the graphics i did like , something different and kinda cool. But game play is a big fat thumbs down , skill to play , very little , time before realize it is not worth what you paid , not quick enough to get money back unfortantly , but wont take a day. 12 hours tops.

Also i dont think you should even try to play this if you dont have a controller.(they actually added keyboard icons now so thats cool, except no one plays this anymore.)"

I then proceeded to matched against them 3 more times. Each time I lost about 140 points, since they slaughtered us at every turn. Couldn't even damage them.Not only did they have a perk point advantage, they were clearly better than us skill wise too.Did I mention we had only been playing for a few hours? And here we are in ranked, getting our♥♥♥♥♥♥pounded in, because the game’s player base seems to be dead on release.As for an actual review I might as well add some points as to why I dislike the game. Besides the matchmaking.GAME PLAYIt's actually fun. Each Outlaw is unique both art wise and ability wise. The art is done by the same people as Darkest Dungeon, so expect lots of character in this game.There are a few latency issues which let you get hit by things that you may have seen yourself dodge but that’s something that plagues numerous other games, so I don’t expect an indie game to be immune to these issues.The game feels satisfying, and would be fast paced, if not for the ♥♥♥♥ing timers and animations and post-game screens you have to sit through during, and after a game. This stuff makes my skin crawl. The last thing I want to do after a defeat is be forced to do ♥♥♥♥ing nothing for a solid 30 seconds. This is pretty well known in games that pauses and animations are nice in a game, but only when used conservatively. Take portal for example. When you die in portal, you instantly respawn at the beginning of the puzzle/checkpoint. In this game, when I die there’s a death timer/waiting for your ally to kill everyone/die. And then the post-game stats and♥♥♥♥♥♥can’t be instantly skipped. I should be able to press a key twice and have that♥♥♥♥♥♥gone from my view, because half of it doesn’t even matter when you just want to queue up again. But you have to be punished even further for your failure.HUDThe hud is very minimal, which I like, but certain things aren’t displayed properly, with no way to know what they do. I understand that ~!!WOUNDED!!~ is bad. And that I should avoid that and try to do it to my enemies. But am I ♥♥♥♥ing slowed? Am I stunned/disarmed? Should I take cover should I not roll is my AIM ♥♥♥♥ed? Big red letters do me ♥♥♥♥ all if I don’t know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on.Besides from the total lack of information about status effects the hud doesn’t take up much screen space which, again, is always nice.The camera angle naturally favors those who are beneath you, or yourself, if you’re below your enemy. This is because the camera angle is fixed at a tilt, and while visually pleasing means that your enemy will see you before you see them, in this case.IN GAME MENUSPorted straight from a console game folks. You can’t even change the horrendous bindings. I should be able to navigate the menu with one hand. Or at least be able to use my mouse. But I have to hit ♥♥♥♥ing enter. Ya know, that one key ♥♥♥♥ING MILES away from wasd. I thought this was a core of gameplay design? You bind that♥♥♥♥♥♥to spacebar. Always. No exceptions. It’s inconvenient and annoys the player.OVERALLGreat gameplay broken up by frustrating pauses in gameplay and bad Menus which only serve to frustrate the player."

What's the point in the game that is all about aiming and quick reflexes when every second enemy / team member has bad 1mb net connection and warps around the map?Idea and gameplay is exellent but the game is unplayable at it's current state. Also there are not many players since matchmaking (which basically just puts anyone possible in same match with anyone possible) takes sometimes up to 10 mins. Rounds last 20seconds - few minutes and waiting for new game takes long. Also atleast for me 2v2 feels too few. 5v5 and 10 v 10 would be more chaotic and fun.Game also suffers from countles graphics bugs which occurs 100% every round. Most notable is the blue map where everything is invisible exept players and this does not happen to everyone sametime so it makes you to be true underdog. Not being able to see where walls etc is when enemy can makes it quite hard to survive.Also since people with toaster computers and hamster powered net connections usually DC before round even starts making you to fight alone versus 2 enemies which would actually be cool (I like challenge) otherwise but then you realize your enemies run on bikepowered net connections and warp around the map while you take dmg and get stunned from invisible bullets in all blue world where you can see only yourself.The point is that all this would be ""ok"" if it happened once a while.

After the initial struggle from my lack of skill, the game started getting more and more interesting the more we played it.Covers became helpful, hiding became very important and I finally managed to keep enemies far from me.My suggestion is, keep playing when you feel it's time to drop off, the game has MUCH more to offer once you get more used to it. It gets very interesting all that cover-stealth-shoot gameplay and I love how you can use the evade move not only to avoid being shoot, but also to cover long distance which makes extremely helpful when you need to take cover, hide and reload.Stay tuned for further updates, it's time to play Secret Ponchos a bit more ;)FIRST REVIEWThe graphic is STUNNING, however the gameplay as of this date, felt extremely dull.

Music and sound is also great.HOWEVER:there are some bugs in the game, the animations are nice but sometimes they desync (like when you reload, your character reloads but the reload animation is not showing) and matchmaking is kinda frustrating in the beginning.Conclusion:If you ignore some occasional bugs and animation desyncs, overall, the game is fun, its addictive and it requires actual SKILL, its very hard to master [especially some outlaws (Matador *khm khm*)] and I highly recommend it.My rating would be 8,5/10."

The dev team is doing an awesome job getting this game going, the gameplay and mechanics are working great and playing with people is a blast. There are some things missing, but remember this game is still in development, so it still has things coming. Right now there seem to be plans for more than just 2v2 deathmatches, currently available, things like 2 player splitscreen, some form of single player matches, other than just a dummy shooting gallery. The game is also lacking some features like key binding, but that is in the works, and menu functionality with mice, is also on the list. These aren't terrible inconviences but could be a big negative for some. Overall, if these inconveinces are too much wait a couple months for a newer build to come out, or go nuts when the game is released, but DEFINITELY pick this title up if you like MOBAs, its fun, fast-paced, and a great experience."

This is a game you should give it a go, but prob at this stage not something you will  play for long term. Graphic are cartoony and reasonable, but the third person isometric camera view often will be block off by props, which is quite a problem. Controls are mostly smooth but on occassions mess up. Sometimes you get stuck in walls. Not much balance is done to classes. You may think this is a shooter game, but melee attacks are much more powerful and effective.Pros:-On Sale :)-Decent graphics-Numerous classes to choose from, with customizable stats-No class unlock needed, no pay to win-Different modes and mapsCons:-Balance required-Bugs-No 2v3 prevention, will just ♥♥♥♥ up your experience.-Not enough players, even during free promotion-No interaction with in game currencyOverall: Try it if you have the money to spare, but don't worry if you don't, you are not missing out on anything.

I've only played a couple games and know that this is going to be rediculously fun.

I was unfortunate enough to be on during a horrible server connectivity time, which wasn't all that great.

You've got everything classic covered, from your native american warriors, to the former soldier, young gun , spooky supernatural bandito and others.The music is very well done and gets you going for some wild shoot outs and has a nice cinematic feel.  The cover system is neat and overall the gameplay is fast and results in furious matches that usually end in some appropriately epic way.  The maps are laid out well and have cool details to see as you dive around corners or behind tables, weave in and out of train cars, or run through an old town.

76561198014921512,Recommended,265750,20162138,"Posted: 31 December, 2015",all,vinnceee,"So the other day i was playing with my friend and i ran into one of the devs in the game. We were having a hard time finding two other people to play with so we got some time to discuss the game with the dev. I was asked to write a review and this is my first review on steam but i decided to write it since i am a fan of this gameWith the dev we discussed if maybe the game would be better if it were free to play. If they ran it like a moba or like other F2P. It does make me sad that their game seems to be dying since the combat is so satisfying and i absolutely love the art style and the game mechanics.I guess for the purpose of the review i will say that i do suggest this game and personally i have enjoyed my time playing it but my main purpose for writing the review was to pose what i thought to the devs in hopes they might read it and do with that information what they will. So i myself asked the question why is the game having such a hard time? and what would fix it? My theory for the absoluetly biggest problem is the main menu. The core game. The combat, the mechanics and just the overall finish in game seems very well done and is very satisfying but the main menu really really feels broken. The reason i think this is such a problem is because the main menu is the first thing that a player in presented with playing a game. I noticed that the mouse does not work all the time with selection in the main menu and sometimes the keyboard is needed even though the mouse should be able to select. I felt that the menu was very limited and was hard to navigate particularly the first and second times you load up the game. Also something that really really took away from the experience is the way in which the matchmaking tool is implemented. the fact that you select quickmatch and then it puts you in an uncancelable que is really bad. there should maybe be a selection of game mode prefered and then a launch botton to put you in que. I have had many times when first figuring out the menu with my friend where i had to force cancle the game because i was locked in que before we had been in a party. I also noticed that some options the game was telling me about seemed to not exist in the menu such  as unranked mode. I thought maybe that unranked had been removed to make the player pool one pool since there were not enough players for consistant matchmaking.I could complain about my specific grievences with the menu system but i dont think that would help too much. I really think it needs to be redesigned perhaps from the ground up. To be frank the menu is the worst and it is the worst part of this game by a large margin. The core game is awesome like i said before, but the menu is such a  key feature in a game. So  hopefully i made my point. Do i think that a different business strategy would work better? maybe, its hard to say and i am no experienced game developer but i can say that the menu was a HUGE red flag and an albatross bringing this game downOnce again i hope this was appropriate and to all players out there i highly recommend this game. It has very statisfying and tactical PvP combat and I love the western setting, but devs please please revisit the menu design and implication"
