I didn't rely on the people in this review section, and here I am, tossing money out of the window at a mobile port that has no merit on PC whatsoever. I know you all don't have time to read text that I write, so I devide my review in Bulletpoints for easier confus- ehem, understanding.+ Pixels+ HD Mode+ All ""Elements"" unlocked from the start- Bad PC port that doesn't support wide screen (Ugly, nauseating borders)- Not even Sound Volume Sliders- Bad AI pathfinding- Nimble Editor, Mouse/Keyboard Pottential not used.- Grossly oversized UI (In my opinion, if you like buttons covering up 1/6 of your screen at any time...)- Look at the DLC box. The guys at Pixowl are already doing the TERRIBLE DLC thing.- ""Mana"" (In-game currency) not removed, Microtransactions beware.At the moment, this Early Access suffers from a bad case of Mobile Port Trauma. Plague Inc. Has shown us how to do a good PC port: You take the working iOS/Android Concept, rebuild the Game in a new, adaptable engine, Consistently add new features while listening to the community for support, feedback and translations.This Game is placed in one line with Tiny Troopers and the lot. No Merit to be on steam, Buyer's remorse galore.Now, If you excuse me, I have to eat chocolate. A lot of it."

But what I got was a waste of money that I could have used to buy Don't Starve, but instead I got:1. A game with a confusing tutorial (the developer has asked me to detail this, SPOILER ALERT: In one of the early tutorials in which I was tasked to mine out a mountain to get metal which i would use to fill a square. There was no mountain, just a square)2. Lacking graphics even for early access3. Bad sound design4. No way to quit out other than Xing out, and when you do it doesn't save your game. (fixed, may have been a bug)It has potential, but for now avoid it. I want a refund, because this game is a waste of time.EDIT: Shut up you guys, I know it's supposed to be 8-bit, it still looks like crap. Early Access is no excuse for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, there still has to be SOME level of quality.EDIT NUMBER 2: Ok, I'm sorry if my review sounded ragey but I was just seriously disappointed. For those of you who didn't guess, I rate Early Access games as if they are full games in order to help the devs make the game better in the full version. I get having a pixel art stylization but it still doesn't look good. Maybe bump it up to at least 16 bit, or be consistent and make them as detailed as the tutorial guy in the game.Furthermore, I'm tired of people yelling at me and me not being able to respond. If you're going to make a comment, have the comments open in your profile. Otherwise, if a comment frustrates me, I'm just going to delete it.ANOTHER EDIT: I have played the game for longer and found that it is actually pretty ok. The save glitch is fixed, it might have just been a bug that happened once. But the graphics seriously get in the way on the later campaigns in which you can't see what thing you're supposed to light/power/blow up/ etc. It's ok, but I'd still wait for it to be finished."

You can't click on anything, or it will crash the game.- In ""create"" mode, none of the tools work, except the eraser, and screenshot tool. Everything else crashes the game. (That's already 1/4 of the game that doesn't work)- In the mission mode, the tools still don't work. (Thats 3/4 of the game that doesn't work).- Finially, the gallery feature crashes when downloading/viewing other's creations. That's right.The game does not work.Conclusion: This game is simply a mediocre mobile game, ported over terribly (that's an understatement), to the point where the game does not even work, period. They didn't even put any effort into changing any of the features in-game to match the fact that it is not on a mobile device. Do not waste your time, nor money, on this scam.Here's some other gripes:- About 20 minutes of gameplay, until you get bored.- Deceptive trailers- Strange resolution errors- especially when starting up the game, and the menu."
,Not Recommended,265810,9921692,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,scatward shitstains,"I decided to completely edit this review because of it's hostility, just so you know alot of the not helpfuls and the discussions are / is probably because I was a real cynical prick with my previous review.I have only played this game for a short time so I dont know if I just missed alot or just need more time to get used to it, but here you go (dont depend too much on this, take this more of as an ""addon"" for the other reviews)I firstly want to say that, the physics are pretty awesomely made, besides the thing that the water keeps having spasms on the top layer and cant be kept still without freezing it completely, which is really annoying when you want to make oceans or lakes or ponds just for the looks.Also, the graphics / the art are amazingly done, however there again, the resolution has not been edited in a single way so youre basically just gonna play a resized / larger pixel version of the Ipad game.What seriously disappointed me, were the humans.They basically either sit or move around slowly, without any walking animation which would be okay, if it wasnt for this really annoying and stupid max cap of 6 humans.Also, you dont directly get everything in the game.Alot of elements, and almost every tree and ai etc, has to be bought with ""mana"", which you only get from finishing quests, and from what i know this game doesnt feature a way to bypass those yet, so if you ONLY want a sandbox experience without having to do alot of quests, then this isnt your best choice either.The game actually has ALOT of potential to become better, however as of now, it simply isnt worth the 9,99 for early access.Theres alot of linear games that I personally find better than this, and for me non-linear is usually much better.Alot of the potential comes from the devs which seem to be pretty cool, and want to hear from bugs and cool things to do from / with this game all the time, they are really interactive with the community so I dont think this game is a ""Refund-now"" case.The music isnt the best, but it isnt bad either.So heres my summarized score:Gameplay: 2/10Graphics: 8/10 (9/10 if it wasnt for the mentioned scaling / no resolution situation)Music: 4/10Potential: 8/10Devs: 8/10Overall: 5/10Also, these are some things the devs should fix to make this game be better and recieve a good score:First off, scratch the human maximal capacity. This is what mostly ruined the game for me. I can only spawn 6 humans, I mean theyre just like 6 pixels that stand around or randomly walk into two directions, I think we should be able to spawn as many as we want to.Second, add some better deaths. I throw lava on a human i expect to see him run around burning and turning into a charred corpse or atleast just run around and then fall down, but he just simply disappears. It made me think if that was intended or if it was just a glitch in the game.Also, you talk about a zombie survival mode. So when we shoot zombies will they also just simply disappear in a mere nano second?Third, give us an option to, for example have normal water that doesnt have spasms on the top layer, shooting blue pixels up the sky every second. Just some still water so I can create a lake or pond and have it be there instead of disappearing in mere minutes.Fourth, an option to unlock everything with just one click. This game is supposed to be a sandbox after all, so I would like to have more freedom of what I want to do, instead of being forced to do certain stuffs and quests so I can buy me a pine tree to grow.Fifth, More Modding Support, like creating custom creatures or elements.Sixth, more human varations. Right now theres only one man and one woman and the workers.Thats all I can think of. These are the truly gamebreaking things in this game for me.You fix / adress these issues and I'll probably give this a good review, considering the graphics and future updates stuff look / sound really good."

Granted, it has a lot of interesting concepts at work, and maybe if it wasn't just a pixel based game it might be something, but as it stands, it's not.Also, all the images above to sell the game are downright lies. All those images are splash screens, and aren't of the actual game. Any ""people"" in the game are made of six pixels, and have only rudimentary A.I. at best; it's less like a god simulator in the same world as ""Black and White"" or ""Godus"" and more along the lines of a worse version of ""From Dust.""My suggestion is to avoid this game, unless ten dollars isn't a huge amount of money for you, but there are better games for this amount. Quite frankly, it doesn't meet the ""dollar per hour"" standard I use, even at $10."

This one lags horribly, especially when using such things as the earthquake. It makes static noises. And it just works like garbage in general. On top of that the screenshot that shows mobile size vs pc size is a load of bull. It's not landscape at all. In fact, there's a rock looking skin on either side of your screen and no option showing that you can change it to a larger size. Finally, the game is EXTREMELY behind in updates compared to the mobile device. I can honestly recommend this game for pc. And there's literally so many bugs that it SOMEHOW managed to show a quest that was further ahead on one and it wouldn't let me pass when I did the correct items. And it takes forever for the game to accept that you correctly completed something."

The other reviewers has probably a very bad computers.- you get all the levels that are paid extra on mobile phones.Cons: - Just like on mobile phone! .. Seriously the resolution of this game makes my eyes hurt. The fullscreen on 27"" fullHD monitor is just bad. I played it for couple of minutes and my eyes still hurts from it. (there's actually the windowed mode if you press F1, still more eye friendly, not so pixelated font would be great)- same small workspace. Wish I could have a bigger workspace on PC.I would like The Sandbox if there was some work visible in the porting this game to PC. Like some extra features that would not work for mobile phones but would be handy for PCs (bigger resolution and workspace)For someone the fact that it's exactly the same as on mobile phones can be a positive aspect. For me it's not and that's why I am not recommending this game."

You can buy your way through the campaign, it costs 150 in game currency to pass any mission, most missions give you over 200 or even into the 1000s if completed, and for some reason when you skip the mission you still get the in game currency, so you can basicly buy your way through the campaign and still make a profit, you should either make the skipping more expensive, ie for a mission where you can win 1000, it should cost 1200, or when someone skips they should not get any form of bonus.2. I have a windows 8.1 computer and I experience a few crashes now and then, about every 20 mins my game crashes and I have to reload, its a bit more of an annoyance then an actual problem, but it may draw people away from the game."

The release price is $10 and humans dlc is still free.update 12 July: no further work was done on the game between them announcing they would have to take a break from working on the game (despite not having released an update for months) and them releasing it.Update 29 June 2015: With no further work done on the game and issues outstanding since it first hit steam I cannot recommend this game at all unless you buy it on deep discount and are aware it has problems such as: no windowed mode, references to tapping and drawing with fingers left over from mobile port, game doesn't exit when you ext it so you have to kill it with task manager, game creates massive number of ""ffdshow"" taskbar icons while running etc.Update 21 May 2015: Devs have issued statement that they won't be able to work on the pc version for a while due to ""circumstances"". Given the complete lack of progress for ages on the title anyway I would say the game is abandoned at this point. I am therefore changing my recommendation to thumbs down. For the record it was on 52/107 (49%) found helpful before I changed it.Update 27 Jan 2015: Although my review still stands, development on this title has been very, very slow. It's clear that it's not being worked on anything like full time. More like ""a couple of hours on a weekend once a month if you are lucky"". There are bugs which have been reported from when it first launched that are not being fixed. The dev adds more content but doesn't fix these issues: no ability to run windowed, creates lots of ffdshow icons isn systray, game doesn't exit when you exit so you have to kill it with task manager.It is fun now, but I wouldn't bank on it changing much or the bugs in it ever being fixed. For some people this means crashing or unable to actually run the thing.Original review follows:---------------------------------------------------------------If you have been around those areas of the web dedicated to free games you have probably seen a lot of what are termed ""Falling Sand"" games. Basically you have a blank screen and can ""draw"" pixels on it. For example you set your brush to 'sand' and hold the mouse button down: many pixels appear on the screen and fall down with gravity. Other elements behave differently and elements react with each other; you have things like fire, ice, water, TNT, acid, steam etc.The main difference between this and other falling sand games are the missions. It's like if you got a falling sand game and added stuff like from those incredible contraption machine games (or Bad Rats haha). There are quite a lot of missions in total, plus a user gallery which is already quite full since this has been released on iOS for a while.In this Falling Sand game you've got your familiar elements like fire, virus, sand, water etc., then you have some electronic/logic type stuff like power, metal, LEDs, detectors etc. for building minecraft like creations. You then have some more ""god game"" type ones (that do feature in some of the online falling sand games too) like clouds, plants that grow and people. You can turn the people into a variety of job-themed things like builder or miner that alters their behaviour so you get a kind of lemmings thing going on. Some of the elements don't do anything though, like purely decorative ones, basically like bitmap stamps.I have The Powder Toy which is free, for windows which is a better simulator with more elements and a higher resolution but I still bought this because there's something cute about the lower resolution, the fact it plays sounds when you add elements, and the interactive things like people.There's nothing else like it on Steam and I recommend it."

You can get more at the steam set value price.Dont buy this, unless you want to waste money."

Don't expect to get entirely addicted to it; it's not that big of a game like Garry's Mod would be, but it is fun to play when you're bored. If you like pixel sandbox games, this game isn't really much more than a graphics update on the old falling sand games, but, I liked those games. It also has cool stuff such as playable arcade game ""characters"" or a ninja. There are also people who you need to give jobs in order to help them survive, etc. But, don't expect TOO much from an Ipad app port, though. This wasn't made for super gaming computers."

The game, when it isn't crashing without reason is difficult to look at. God's text font doesn't look retro, it looks trashy. His text is unclear when the image is blown up this much, and patching the menus and fonts would greatly improve the experience here. Beyond that, the blown-up image isn't nearly as bothersome when building a world. It fits the aesthetic, there.It's not a bad game, but I can't say it's worth your money until these issues have been addressed."

But most Early Access games are far better for the same price....EDIT: For that one who wanted more details. So I try.It starts with ""The acclaimed world-building game"". I would Name it more a world-drawing game. You can put some pixels together, and they ""work"" in different Ways... but on a low Level... It doesnt look too good. But thats even ok, becuase it can be also a conscious design decision. But this makes a game also look simple and cheaper in production. And even with this few special Pixels. It is just Paint... Paint with Physics... Basic Physics.... If you want to teach somebody science, take another game... if you want to be god. Take another game. If you want Paint Plus, it is perfect.But even in Paint, you could make big and small pictures. In that game you can't make a big World. I hopped to be able to scroll to the left and right, but no... you really have just that small picture.Than the Humans... they are really stupid... (example) it is a  ""if wood, do cut"" human wo do his task until it doesnt work anymore.... And if there are more than 2/3 Humans... they sometimes doesnt even are able to pass there another by. They dont start working with each other. And oh, there is something that want to kill us. Lets just wait and stay... Maybe it doesnt see us.....The last thing is that this game just crashes a lot... and totaly random and unexpected. Ok.... Early Access...But what i think, is that most of the things above are a wanted design. Somebody said hey, that would make fun, i want that game (maybe for myself and then he sold it), lets look what happens. And this is absolutly ok! We dont need everywhere a AAA game. But what really *****, and so... I come back to my review... it would be ok for 2,99€... No Problem. Lets just have some fun with it. And some will play it never again, other had nice 20min. But not for 10€!!!! If you compare it to other games for that price, than sorry, but they are bigger, or you see that there ist an Idea that maybe someday it will become big, or just great. But this Game is already nearly finished... If not, maybe you should write down where you want to go, what you want to accomplish like the Spacebase DF-9 did."

Seriously. Nothing could look good.I saw few people doing pixel art... you better use PAINT than that!-The same point... the whole world is 120x80! Nothing exist outsite that. In game like Terraria, Starbound or Minecraft, you have an big big world really bigger than 120x80. Those games are superior on every aspect.-Everything is so small (a human is 6 pixels, chicken 4 pixels, fish 1 pixel)-Humans are completely stupid and useless. Even low AI seem more advance than that. Example: One human is hungry, so you give him some foods. He do nothing with it... so you feel like that he didn't know which holes use for eating. This example show exactly the level of AI here. You bring lava, they didn't even run away... Wipe theirs existences, they don't care.-It's impossible to build something. So much easier to destroy everything.-Do whatsoever and hope something will happens. Nothing will happens if you don't do it.-The complexity serve nothing. Why build a complex electric system when it's for light a 2 pixels bulb at the end?-Ice never melt. Ice freezes all waters. Lava cancel a little bit the ice. Ice still wins and freezes everything. So you should just never use ice.-If you try things for around 30-40 minutes in one scene in sandbox mode, the game will crash. Did it's the name of the game ""sandbox""?. Happened twice in 1h.

Not to mention, for some reason, I started the game with 100000 mana. Like, seriously, I never earned that much myself, and when I first launched it, BOOM! UNWANTED FREE MONEY! Though some people might argue that that is a good thing, I want to complete the game for myself and earn myself all that cash as opposed to getting it poofed right to me. ALSO, even though SB: EVO is out, please, PLEASE keep working on this, you've got a lot of content to live up to compared to the mobile version.Giving you NOT RECOMMENDED unless you update it for once."

I love these Physics/Chemistry/Whatever powder type games. I've played the free ones for hours. If you enjoy those kinds of games, then you'll like this one. If you don't you'll be quickly bored. There is not really an in between response to this game so if you aren't sure, I'd check out Powder Game or something similar. If you're intrigued then go for this one. If not, give it a pass."
