It's similar in its execution to limbo gives more focus on logic and physics puzzles. Couple of pros anc cons:Pros:- Imaginative use of physics to solve puzzles- Chase scenes where you are trying to escape the foreman are quite well executed and built tension- If you die or get caught you will restart fairly close by so its not frustrating- Dull grey scenery is very well accented by reds and along with background music sets the moodCons:- Controls can feel at times sluggish, this is mostly evident when you are trying to time a jump but you get used to it and overall not a big problem- The game does not try and hold your hand, you have to figure out how you can use the environment to your advantage. Not necessarily a con, just could have been handled/introduced a bit better.- Bugs! I've encountered a few and save for the last one on the very last level they are not blockers on making progress. That said on the last level I had to die and restart because the game simply did not position things rightOverall, great game with some flaws. Still recommend a playthrough for people into platformers. 7/10"

It took me around 4 hours to finish, although those of you who are platformer stars could finish this in 2 hours most likely.It is a beautiful game in the spirit of games like Limbo. Mostly black and white and grey, but with red highlighting special things and used to accent the striking world portrayed. Simply put, this game is stunning.The game is also fairly deep into the topics of slavery and forced labor, by way of an alien invasion kidnapping all the children. You and your brother try to evade capture in this crazy adventure. There is a bit of surrealism or what have you here as well. You leave home to play, and really never see your home again. The ending is one of hope and sacrifice.The controls for the gamepad handle quite nicely. I had no issues with clipping or any of the other issues that can plague games. In fact, as far as I could tell, it was perfectly optimized and free of bugs.It has a nice save system that auto saves at each juncture or before any challenging or significant event and also saves after getting past the same. That means that when you die (and you will likely die a lot), you never have to go too far back, and so even with the more challenging sections, it never feels like a chore.Speaking of challenges, this game was quite challenging IMO. Not that everything was, but I found that some of the puzzles could stretch the mind trying to find the solution. Still, with a 4 hour playtime, obviously nothing was insurmountable. In fact, I would say it was just right for the type of game that it is.All in all, this one is an easy recommendation.8 children escaping the clutches of their alien overlords out of 10 possible."

Without any story told, you will pickup your little brother and help him go through all the obstacles you are facing and escape from bad people.Pro:-Graphics: The graphics are REALLY good. I love the black'n white with hint of red style. Feels reqlly unique (despite this is not the first platformer who offer this, check out Limbo an excellent platformer).-Sound: The music is really good, feels like 1950's musics, with a bit a jazz, it is a good experience for your ears.-Puzzles: Puzzles feels rewarding when solved, almost all of them are well designed, there some that could use a visual hint or two (like the double lift, I was looking at the wrong solution for quite a long time, had to look up for the solution as I couldn't see it but just the one I was trying which at some point seemed possible). I tink sometimes visual hints to go backward could have been good.-Story: Despite being without any background, this is a success I think. You understand things one bit at a time, the background is the narrator. The story told here is not very big, it rely mostly on helping your brother. You get attached to that task.Cons:-Controls: Controls are sluggish at time. It is not that important except when you need to do timed jump, and at that time the game gets frustrating. The tutorial was not clear enough about the jumping system, as I was succeeding all my jump, I didn't give any thought at first, and then you are in a chase scene and you need to do thing fast and it is not well responding, then you start yelling at your jump. Specially on the achievement Conscience to save a robot from crushing under a press. Looked up a playthrough online, and the layout of the button was different from mine (perhaps a different build than the final one), You have to do some timed jumps and be very reactive, I was trying really hard for at least 15min, then doing more or less the same thing as before, the jump activated as wished and I was able to complete it.I should'nt stop you from completing the game but a bit of polishing on the control would have been good.-Bugs: I found some bugs, mostly collision, when that happens you are a bit in a bind as you have to restart the whole checkpoint, despite them being well spread it's still a bummer.To conlude:I finished the game in about 4h (a bit more with the achievement of the robot), found 9 out of 16 secrets (I will probably look up for info in order to get them all).Will you, like me, help your brother? I do hope so.I do recommend this game to people who like platformers (specially if you liked Limbo, this one should be in your taste).Luuna."

First few levels that act as ""tutorial"" have nothing of the sort explained what you're about to face in the game. So you have most of the time no idea what the hell you're supposed to do and most likely due to that, you will die quite a few times until you've just had enough and gonna go watch a walkthrough how to proceed forward from the section you're stuck at.I got this game cheap but I can't help but admit that it was waste of my money, since the game is very frustrating due to ""die to proceed -> watch walkthrough -> die to proceed -> watch walkthrough"". It's not impossible to make a game that is legitimately hard/unforgiving but also fun and passable/understandable. This game is not that since you're expected to do things you have no idea about.Game runs kinda smooth but it's sad to say that it also ignores the AMD framecap settings I'm trying to use and instead the game flies between 93-1000frames. Menus are usually ridiciolously high 600fps in this and the game is 93-170 which is quite annoying.Visuals are decent and not really anything that should be complained about. Audio has nice reverbation effects but the panning/spatialization on audio is certainly quite bad. Atleast when played on a pair of headphones, usually if a train forexample is coming from the right, the audio is on the very end of right side, making it sound odd and this is how it is with every piece of audio in this game, the spatialization is very bad.Game cannot be recommended since the sidescroller genre offers better games for the same price and offer more also value for your spent money."

You pretty much see what needs to be done immediately.2)Your character's movements seem way more sluggish then they need to be. For example - running is slow as balls & there seems to be too much downtime while recovering from a jump or fall. I understand that this may be a design feature to enhance the drama of the chase. But it feels unnecessary & bothersome at times.3)The difficulty in this game stems from having to be precise. However, your character handles like crap. sometimes refusing to grab onto switches & ledges. And other times just plain refusing to let go of switches & ladders. This causes you to fail the timed puzzles & redo them, over & over & over & over & I think I made my point. (& so you don't think I'm complaining because of ""lack of skill"" check my progress on ""Limbo"". I'm fine with deaths & having to be precise, but the game's controls better not be a stumbling block.)4)The backgrounds are beautifully made. However the character animations look rigid.5)For what this game is. It's WAY overpriced. Glad I only paid $4.99, but I still feel ripped off.Play Limbo or wait for Inside."

,Not Recommended,265830,21268966,"Posted: 16 February, 2016",all,"""Bob"" the Space Cadet","Monochroma looked so good on the store page, but once I started playing it I quickly realised just what kind of puzzle platformer it is. The controls feel slow and floaty, and the key to making a precise jump is to press jump before you actually want to go up. I think the thing that bothered me most about this game was that you break your brothers leg and have to carry him around, and you can only put him down in spots that are well lit because you are a nice guy - that part is okay, I guess, but it falls apart when you can only leave him under a street lamp in the rain where you're going to lower a shipping container (which will crush him if you're not quick enough to pick him up after you pull the lever), but you aren't allowed to put him down next to the lever that lowers the container which is not only well lit, but it's also out of the rain and not under threat of being crushed. The puzzle plaforming just doesn't seem well thought out in some spots, which will probably cause me not to bother coming back to this, which is a shame because it looked so interesting.If you liked Limbo, this is very reminiscent of that. Dark and moody, no voice dialogue, imprecise floaty controls, and many industrial-themed environmental deaths to be had.4/10 Would not break my brother's leg again. Well, maybe."

From a unusual atmosphere, I was captivated from the beginning to the end with a outstanding experience. For me, one of the main reasons for the success is the balance created betweeen puzzles, walking and story. Thanks to the beautiful and weird environment, you can really feel the character's agony to save his friend. It has some minor bugs, but can be forgiven due to the appreciable effort applied in this game development. Also, it has a surprising ending which I loved."
76561198004855190,Not Recommended,265830,10940737,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Ramesh,"I cannot recommend this game because I found it much more frustating than anything else.There are some quite good things about this game:* the art style is quite reminiscent of Limbo, largely murky greyscale (not much use of sharp contrasting black and white) with and the ocassional splash of red which makes it a bit less dull.  The game is a 2d platformer but the background and foreground that you can't interact with are used well to conjure the world and tell the story* the menu allows you to revisit bits of the game that you've already completed, so if you've missed collecting secrets or want to replay a bit you liked then you can do that without needing to replay through from the beginning.* check points are spaced fairly closely together, so when you die you usually don't lose too much progress.But mostly I'm afraid that I found it a frustrating experience, without much fun.* No attempt to develop connection to brotherThe main gimmick of this game is that your brother has broken his leg, and cannot walk so you must carry him everywhere, and because he is afraid of the dark you can only put him down in (very infrequent) spotlights.  Because do not spend much time with your brother before he breaks his leg you don't develop much connection to him.  He makes you jump less high and he basically just feels like a burden, because he does nothing for you, and doesn't interact with you very much.The story would have much more impact if your brother had more depth, if he had a personality and you could develop a connection to him, instead of just feeling like he's a burden.* Long reload times and not infrequent deathsEach time you die it takes about 5 seconds to reload. That is quite frustrating in and of itself, but it is also quite easy to die, some of the jumping puzzles require a fair amount of precision, and some of the puzzles require a bit of experimentation to see how things work, so unless you are pyschic you won't work out how to solve it without dying at least once.* Bugs - not manyThe game is a little buggy, a few times I have passed through walls and floors that I shouldn't have been able to, but it doesn't happen so often that this is a big problem.  Dying takes you back to the latest checkpoint which isn't far away, and solves any problem that the bug would have caused.* Slow and unfun controlsPlatformers often have characters who are very nimble and are fun to control, and much of the fun comes from the sense of agility that the game gives you. In this game your character is a bit slow, and while you are carrying your brother you can jump less high.In Limbo, and to some extent this game, the unfun controls to some extent serves to make you feel less powerful than you normally do in platformers.  In Limbo that feeling of powerfulness and lack of fun emphasises what the game is about.  Here it also makes you feel not very powerful, but less so than Limbo because you can still make a jump equal to your height even when carrying your brother.  So while there are design reasons for these limits on your abilities the effect makes you feel weak, but not really that much, and is still not fun.* Punishing puzzlesAlmost all of the puzzles are not very difficult, and can be solved mostly through trial and error, but some are rather fussy about their timing and it often feels like the fault of the controls that you fail.In a lot of platformers you have a range of abilities and solving puzzles involves combining them in an interesting way.  Here you can only run and jump, which limits the range of puzzles/challenges to timing/precision based puzzles (which the slow controls don't really lend themselves to), and interacting with objects.As I said above the puzzles often require experimentation, which is okay in and of itself, but you will die quite a few times because of this and the slow pace, unfun controls and long reload times make the puzzle solving feel more chorish than fun.  Often you quickly workout the key idea of the puzzle, but sorting out the details involves dying a few times, and repeating the bits you've already done.* No camera controlIt is quite helpful in platforming games to look up or down, so you can tell where you need to go next, but here you have no control.  So sometimes you make leaps downward to explore and maybe find a secret, but you just die.* Short - I completed the game in 7 hoursI do not think that this is a big deal: Short experiences can be much more rewarding than some longer experiences.  But some people do think this important, so I feel it should be mentioned.This game is by no means terrible, and if you can forgive unfun controls for pretty art and an okay story then it might be worth getting this game.  But even then I think there are games out there that do that better."
,Not Recommended,265830,20648757,"Posted: 20 January, 2016",all,conniferusblack,"Got the game during a sale based on the primarily positive reviews.Spoiler free review.What I liked:Overall aesthetic of universe.The universe starts out normal enough but as your journey forth, it reveals a more menacing side.(I love that about this and how everything escalates into an intriguing world.)The monochromatic color scheme.Is overall lovey and colors become even more enhanced through your experience while you play through. At several moments in the game, I found the game genuinely beautiful. The design felt complete and well thought out,The soundtrack.In the rare moments where the music comes into play, it builds tension, atmosphere and pacing beautifully.What I was disappointed about:The silence between the brothers.I'm not asking for actual conversation, but even the smallest suggestions of dialogue should happen between the brothers. Instead, they are silent and do not have anything to say about the environment or the complex situations they find themselves in.Compare to the interactions of the brothers from ""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"" and you'll see what I mean.Functionality of the controls.There are times where certain puzzles are very time based. This is frustrating when your character doesn't jump when he needs to. This will happen multiple times where you literally have to start the puzzle over because your character didn't react fast enough.At times, I came across puzzles where I thought I was unable to solve to puzzle...only to realize I was going about it the right way and the controls weren't responding the way I had wanted.Puzzles.There were a couple times where I felt very accomplished after solving a puzzle, but that is far and few in between.The majority of the puzzles are actually very straightforward and not too difficult to figure out.In addition, nearing the end of the game, involving a boss battle, the ingenuity felt strangely lacking. It wasn't immediately clear what needed to be done and made for a lot of trail and error. Not the good kind.Your main characters.Having the little brother being carried throughout 90% of the story made for the brother to be a nuisance than someone you'd protect.The entire game is essentially an escort mission. The little brother doesn't feel alive, but rather an item you carry that can consequently die and restart your game.You don't get to know the brothers much throughout this long journey.No small interactions/ conversations between the brothers and how they react to the world around them.The logic of the younger brother only wanted to be left behind in light made sense in the beginning, but as the puzzles started getting more complicated, it got a little silly.(ie. ""Sure, bro, I'll just leave you on this conveyor belt where you might get crushed. But it's OK. There's a light, so it's safe."")Summary:I can feel what this game is trying to do, but when I reached the end, I only felt relief that I didn't have to play more and disappointment that they didn't do more with the universe they created.The aesthetic is beautiful, but the world feels empty and unlived in.You're forced to invest your time in characters you have a hard time caring about.And the only thing to get you to come back to playing the game is the aesthetic.Overall, if you want to try the game, get it during a sale.It's definitely not worth full price."

But the whole character of the game is so intriguing that I am fascinated by it. It is a dark and tense game, you feel the tension all over the place. A good thing about it is that, the game does not rush you at any time, as it happens in many games(i hate that) yet it is not slow in any way and achieves to be somewhat dynamic and entertaining. If you are a clumsy gamer when it comes to the controls, you gotta be careful, I am a bit clumsy and had to repeat things for several times at times, so that could be a downer if you are both clumsy and impatient at the same time. As I said before I am not a big fan of puzzles, and that is because most of the time they are impossible or too easy, and not very well constructed, now this is what makes Monochroma special; the puzzles are constructed in a very intelligent way, not only that you enjoy while figuring them out, but also you get to feel smart after you solve them=D. And an A+ for the music, not only it suits the game perfectly, but also independently from that it is real good, actually I am listening to it on Spotify. Kudos to Gevende for the amazing soundtrack!What got to me the most, are some details as you can not leave your little brother anywhere you want, you have to leave him at some place where it is sufficiently illuminated because, as a little kid, he obviously is scared of dark, that's gotta be the cutest thing I've ever seen in a videogame, and it is especially beautiful, when it is in such a tense, cold and hostile environment that the game is set in. The last thing, before going back to keep playing some more, while in the immense majority of the videogames, you have to compete no matter what, be reckless, merciless and etc. a game set in a (not so far from the potential reality of a) distopia, in this game, you have to take care of your little brother and be compassionate of him; this is a breath of fresh air!

The narrative of the game is told without any dialogue which adds dramatic impact somewhat to the story. Along with its dark settings and unexpected ending it is definitely a memorable experience.Overall I had a wonderful time with this game and loved the artistic environments. There are a few annoying things though that I found frustrating while playing:-Hard to judge the jump mechanics at times as it seems to change with the environment.-Because of above reason, lots of cheap deaths-Still a little buggy... I installed the game and when I was playing my system crashed twice. To the developers credit they have fixed most of the issues that effected the game early on so I think they're doing a good job to fix the issues when they come up.-Relatively short gameplay at 6 hours with not much replay value.I would still recommend this game if you are a fan of a dark, dystopian world with a unique story. Games like these add more value to the gaming community and I'm glad we're seeing more indie developers out there sharing their creative visions."

It consists of 4 lengthy levels.The setting seems to be more like the 1930s than the 1950s - with a few bizarre and completely out of place elements.The game is silent and does not have much of a storyline. The description says:""The game has a unique approach to storytelling without using any written or spoken words.""Thats like the opposite of storytelling ...yeah, its a fail.

You are playing as the older of two brothers and you have to carry your injured lil brother through the puzzles. Reminds me a bit of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons mixed with LIMBO (without that creepy bigass spider). Monochroma tells its story without using any diaglogues. It's all visual. I like the way of storytelling a lot but the story itself wasn't that catchy. There were maybe 1-2 moments when I was like ""Awww... - Ok, lets move on.""The game takes place in the 50's and the graphics are black&white colored with red only which looks great, plus the lovely music.Well, that's it..3/5 for Monochroma"

The artstyle and surroundings in the pictures of Monochroma was what drew me to buy this game since they reminded me of Limbo, one of my all-time favorites. With that said, if you have not played or heard of Limbo this review might be somewhat undescriptive.In Monochroma you are the older brother of two, who has to protect the younger brother who is injured and pretty much lifeless by carrying him on your back through the game. So basically the entire game is one long escort mission. You can drop your brother off at certain points which allows you to jump higher and so forth, this is a core mechanic of the game and it's puzzles. The gameplay and puzzles are quite good although sometimes they can be quite unclear of their objective. I had to resort to a guide online several times throughout this game. I don't know if that is a sign of a somewhat poorly designed game or of me being stupid. I should point out that throughout my intial playthrough of Limbo I never had to resort to a guide. Another criticism I have is the controls. (I played this with a Xbox 360 controller.) I'd say that the jump button has a little delay and is not nearly as responsive as in, surprise, Limbo. You might get used to it, I don't think I did cause it made me irritated pretty much through the whole game. I think the controls in general could be better and more responsive. Also the game can be occasionally buggy.The boss battle with the octopus dude is crap. I had to do that several times. Not because it was difficult or because I suck but because it was poorly designed if you ask me.It might sound like I dislike this game since I've only brought up criticism but there are good parts as well. The music is pretty nice although the ""death jingle"" is ironically happy. My biggest praise for this game would be for it's beautiful graphics and the settings. I usually don't care that much for graphics and such but in this game they are just right. The atmosphere in the many different settings and surroundings is great and fits just right. The plot is pretty basic yet interesting with tidbits beingshownduring the loading-screen.All in all, I would recommend you to buy Monochroma if you already have played Limbo and are looking for more of thesame. If you have not played Limbo, go buy that and play it. I'd say that Monochroma is more of a poor man's Limbo since it is not nearly as well polished as Limbo if you ask me.TL;DR: Buy this game if you have some spare cash and enjoyed Limbo."

No. I consider this a solid addition to the puzzle platformer genre which is worth a playthrough. The atmosphere is well done, though the story could use a bit more depth. The controls are also at times too loose causing frustrations. However, even with these criticisms the puzzles prevent enough variety to make the game enjoyable. 8/10."

I thought it was going to be a deeper story about the brothers, but it seems more like a game against big business, big brother, and the greed and tyranny that they produce. The story is not told in words, but rather the gameplay so it is possible I interpret this differently than the game intended. I felt the music was good, but the problem is that it seems to rarely be there. Sort of sets a very boring/quiet tone. But when the music plays, it really seems to enhance the experience.Out of the 4 hours I played to beat it, about a third to a half of that time was waiting on loading and death reloads. Oh, I didn't mention the game takes about 30 seconds to load inbetween each death. Maybe this is just me, but my computer can run games like the Batman Arkham series with very little loading, so why does this game take more than 5 seconds to load? And you will die alot due to trial and error, a format I don't mind, but don't think I should die about 10 times in the same spot and wait 30 seconds each time.The character feels sluggish. Not sure how to accurately describe it other than saying that the control of the character seems imprecise. Since I also played Never Alone, a game about the Alaskian native tribes, I would recommend that game over this to get a similar experience. And the two play differently, but I feel Never Alone is the better game in the genre, even though I ran into a few bug that didn't break the game.I don't feel this is worth the retail price, though it may be a good for some at a steep discount."

It’s a game about being a kid, growing up with a little brother that needs your help, facing obstacles and solving unique puzzles in a dystopian 1950's setting.""As soon as I started to play I had lost almost all of the interest, because when you are playing, the game feels completely different in every aspect. The first factor that becomes noticeable uncomfortable are the controls and the way they respond, it feels so mediocre and becomes a little bit annoying due to the fact that movements are not faithfully translated into the game, furthermore, the movements of your character in the game are somewhat stiff to the point that gets you somehow desperate. Long story short: movements and physics shown on the promotional videos are not what you'll have inside the real game.LIMBO and other games alike similar to this one are by far better choices if you want to have a deeper and fulfilling atmospheric experience."

Unfortunately the controls of the game arent't good at all.There are some design flaws in the core mechanics. I think the game doesn't make it clear where and when you can put your little bother down. You can put him down in ares highlighted by a light source. But there are some bright spots in the game where it simply is not allowed to put him down. At one point not far from the start there are two light bulps, one you can use the other one you cannot.Another thing I really don't like is that you have harsh punishment as instant death in the trial and error puzzles. Trying out a lever aaaand you're dead.The timing puzzles are a real pain because of the previously mentioned issues with the game controls. It feels to me like strechting the gameplay because the player have to retry the puzzles over and over (some not all).The Music is good, but i think the game has to less soundeffects when the music stops, you're litterally punished with almost complete silence while the puzzle sections. It feels like something is missing here.I really like the atmosphere Monochroma wants to creates, but the to less used/missing soundeffects on one hand and the light sources wich are sometimes usable and sometimes not disturb the whole atmosphere in a really bad way. This along with the bad gameplay I'm sure not to pick Monochroma up again.I think Nowhere Studios had a good idea with Monochroma but weren't able to deliver the game as it should have been."

The level designs were good, graphics were great, and sound was decent - but the bad taste from the controls overshadowed most of that. Aside from controls, there were a few issues with collision detection where I got stuck and needed to kill myself. A few areas also felt unpolished such as the poor animation when a particular type of enemy kills you... he just walks into you (often literally due to collision detection issues) and you drop dead.It's amazing that, despite how few player buttons/actions are available in the gameplay, they still managed to screw up the controls for basically all of them. It really makes you wonder if any unbiased user(s) ever tested this game prior to release. Most of the challenges in the game were a result of awkward controls that never seem to do what you want until you eventually learn to account for them like a crooked sight on a rifle. It's one of those games where you're trying to quickly drop down a few platforms and your character keeps accidentally getting stuck hanging on the ledge or climbing back up to the top again. If you're hanging on a ladder or rope, one accidental slide of the joystick at a downward angle can make your character fall to his death. Your character has poor jump control so sometimes I'd just slightly tap the joystick to move forward to drop to a platform below and he would leap over it to his death. I could go on and on about the awkwardness, but I did get used to it after 30min to an hour.Since I like games similar to this style of gameplay (Limbo, Inside, Little Nightmares, etc), I stuck with it and eventually it became less noticable. The ""gimmick"" to this particular game is that you have a brother you're carrying around with you the whole time so you have to make sure he escapes safely with you too. I'm reluctant to give this a positive review but I did have some fun with it. If you really love this style of gameplay, it may be worth playing despite the flaws but I'd wait for a sale."
