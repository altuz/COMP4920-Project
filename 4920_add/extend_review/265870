Unfortunately, the experience quickly becomes mired in tedium thanks to an absolutely insane amount of backtracking, terrible writing and boring characters.  After two hours I could stand no more."

Length - the game has such a lack of content and stuff that is there is being rehashed over and over and over. one Flashback scene in particular2. Difficulty - the game is painfully easy, even without fully utilizing your abilities and training you will have no problem at all3. Items - or better the lack thereof. there is basically one weapon for each character for sale at some point and they are pretty pricy too.  few pieces of armor/helmet and accessory's i have found ONE in the whole game. Not that you would need any in regards to -2-.4. Scripted events - no matter how strong you are, how you wipe the floor with event enemies the outcome of the battles won't change in the slightest. It starts to get very annoying at some point. I can understand that the linear path has to go to a specific outcome but there are better ways to make that happen.5. Ending - this trilogy is probably never gonna finish. Part 1 came out in 2011, part 2 (which is not on steam yet) in 2012 and then the dev seemed to abandon the project. The last feedback on how far part 3 is progressing was from 2012 so its safe to assume that the project is dead."

(The only reason is to make the game longer than already is)The game has few songs, and many times it repeats the intro song inside the game, even in a boss fight. The songs aren't bad but the repetition makes them seem old really quick.You will be walking around on the map most of the time without any reason. The World Map is useless and has a disguised loading.the story of the game is really shallow for a story made by a developer that wants to create an anime and a manga about it,There are lots and lots of repeated scenes in the game, and the worst of all 3 episodes got cut off the game even knowing that it was totally possible to put these 3 episodes inside it.Resume...The game is forcibly long and the missions are mostly unnecessary.The songs repeat a lot and they pisses you off. The battles are long and tiring. Not forgetting that the game is absurdly expensive comparing to the games of the same platform.This is one of the WORST RPG MAKER GAMES that exist!That's the reason I say: don't waste your time and money playing this garbage game.-------------------[PT-BR]Não recomendo!O jogo pode ser graficamente lindo, e ter um bom ar de jogo de Nintendo DS.Porém peca muito em ser extremamente longo e demorado.As batalhas são muito desbalanceadas:O golpe normal dos personagens tem quase a mesma força que os golpes especiais.Os bosses quase sempre usam ataques massívos, que causam cerca de 35% de dano, alem das animações serem extremamente longas e lerdas.Fora que as batalhas muitas vezes são forçadas. Pois muitas vezes você vai estar lutando sem nem saber o motivo.A maior parte das missões do jogo são forçadas, onde você deve fazer X coisa para um npc que não vai influenciar em nada na história. (tudo pro jogo ficar mais longo)O jogo possue poucas músicas, e várias vezes vai ficar repetindo a música de introdução dentro do jogo, seja em cenário ou em boss fight. Não que as músicas sejam ruins, mas o excesso de repetição é muito desgastante.A maior parte do tempo voce vai ficar transitando de um mapa para outro sem motivo algum. Fora que o World Map é inútil, alem de ser um loading disfarçado.Quanto a história do jogo, pra uma desenvolvedora que almeja fazer um Anime e um Mangá em cima do jogo, a motivação dos personagens é muito rasa.Fora que há uma repetição de uma cena no jogo várias e várias vezes.E como não bastasse, o jogo foi CORTADO em 3 episódios, sendo que podiam muito bem ter lançado um jogo completo com os 3 episódios.Resumindo...O jogo é forçadamente longo, e as missões são em suma parte desnecessárias. As músicas se repentem de mais e chegam a ser irritantes. Fora as batalhas que são muito longas e cansativas.Ainda que o jogo é absurdamente caro se comparado com outros jogos da mesma plataformaEste é um dos PIORES JOGOS de RPG Maker que existem!Por isso eu digo: não perca seu tempo, nem dinheiro jogando esse lixo de jogo."

Plus combines things in rpgs that I like then normal rpgs mechas and magic. Sadly it just only episode 1 and ends on a cliff hanger can't wait for episode 2 to come to Steam. The only things I have to warn you about there is some back tracking involve and the game only froze on me once in the entire play through outside of it's really great!"

It can be satisfying if stuck on a mission that would take a long time to finish. The battle format is clean and simple with a robust FF design or What ever RPG game that was satisfying to play and the world to travel in was easy and clean with great color. I loved it so much I want to play the second episode and even a third. I would also say that there is a bit of wit and love and drama that can be missed in some games wich made this game fun also I found that reading there conversations fun and easier then listening and not being able to listen again, that and the jurnal made questing easier.  Sneaky wisper parts of conversations was a fun and kind of funny part of the games character interaction.I would recomend this game for it is a game most everybody can injoy, Five out of five stars :D"

The combination of the artwork, music, and gameplay envokes nostalgia for sure. I enjoyed playing this game so far and I plan on finishing it soon. I would like to see more JRPGs like this.Great Job Sherman3D."
,Not Recommended,265870,15451874,"Posted: 19 April, 2015",all,maximonstar,"Alpha Kimori is a great game and everyone should play it, but it is has too many problems to recommend. It has great graphics and a superb battle system, but as an RPG, it story falls too flat and the characters are too one dimensional.First of all this is a well made game, most of the times. It really feels like the developers took their time to craft a great battle system. This is the shiny moment in this game, the enemies become cannon fodder and the games go no further than medium difficulty. The songs at the beginning and end are great, in my opinion. This is a great game for beginners and those who want to have fun.Alas an RPG is only as good as its story and characters, and this is where the game makes its greatest mistake. The story is not bad, but it is mediocre. Don’t worry when the game finally lets you run around you are going to figure out the plot in minutes. Just talk to everyone in town.  You also only get one weapon upgrade which you get from the characters automatically just buy shields and maybe some armor. By the way save all your items for the final battle and it will be easy.  I could go on with the list of problems, but I feel as if this is one of the better RPG Maker games.I hope this developer puts all three episodes together for 15 dollars. As it stands this is a tech demo that tries to be a game. I say buy this game when it goes on sale for five dollars or less."
,Not Recommended,265870,15706698,"Posted: 5 May, 2015",all,HallowNocturne,"Hate to say it but I cannot honestly recommend this game which is a shame because a few elements of it feel like they could lead to a great experience.  The world and backstory offer a good foundation for a larger plot but this ""episodic"" format left my first experience feeling very hollow.I can summarize this by saying I liked about 2 hours worth of the 7 hour experience.  Those 2 hours could have been better established in the first 2 hours of a larger game.  I'd be more forgiving but the game pads itself by forcing you through the same 4 combat zones several times.Will I be looking out for other games by this devloper?  Yes.Will I purchase the rest of the Alpha Kimori series?  No"
,Recommended,265870,11063169,"Posted: 3 July, 2014",all,Goldenkitten,"Alpha Kimori (ep1) is a fun little RPG (in JRPG-style) that while not perfect does prove that with effort a small group of people can use RPG Maker to put something together worth your money. RPG Maker has a seedy reputation due to some people abusing it but it’s far from a bad piece of software, and in the right hands can be used to everyone’s benefit. Alpha Kimori is one such product that stands as testament to this.That said the game doesn’t try to be anything more than it appears to be, a very traditional RPG in the style of old SNES classics. Characters have HP/MP that you use in the usual turn-based format to launch your staple attack/magic/healing commands (given different names in this case, but still the same), and you run around from place-to-place viewing events. So if you’re looking for something that stretches boundaries you’ll be disappointed. But, if you can enjoy that style of old-school gameplay then Alpha Kimori is a very polished version of those styles. I should mention here that battles are not random but instead initiated by contacting enemy sprites on the field.Story-wise things are interesting but feel a little scatter-brained, as if not all the dialogue is in the correct order. For instance our main characters occasionally have drastic shifts in their points of view within the very same discussion, rather than seeming like a solid progression from one view to the next over the course of several discussions. Still the story it’s trying to tell is interesting enough, there are plenty of tropes but it’s still trying to be its own property despite that. Similarly most of the characters are likable, the above mentioned shifting back-and-forth on positions sometimes detracts from them but in the end they’re mostly solid.Some blatantly not so great points include there being a little too much backtracking for its own good as you revisit a small set of locations many times, it could have stood to have a few more songs for world locations and events (for instance it continues playing the bubbly, upbeat city theme even when events get serious which detracts from the scene taking place), and it’s very easy to begin with and even simpler if you spend more than a few minutes grinding with nothing coming close to beating you.So make no mistake, if you don’t like this style of game then Alpha Kimori will NOT change your opinion on them. But if you do then this is a well-polished game that clearly has intent to go somewhere and should keep you content for the 5-7 hour playtime the first episode purports."

I can say the music is very much memorable and the mood of the game is never at a low point due to the colorfulness. However, the events were unfolding in a rather rushed manner at the start and some things made me think ""this feels like something an elementary schooler would write"". The characters weren't exactly weak but their development could have been handled better. I don't know anything about the development of this game but it wouldn't surprise me if this was a rather rushed job or just geared towards a younger audience in general. But on that note, Miku singing the theme song is supportive of the latter thought.However I did enjoy the nostalgic turn based system, though with the large stat increases between levels I never really felt challenged until the very end, and it still wasn't that much of a challenge. Then again, that may have been intentional either because of the shortness of this entry (which I do hope isn't going to end up to be the last of this title) or a desire to minimize the tediousness of level grinding as can be experienced in other JRPG's or other RPG's in general.Though as I progressed through the game it felt like things were improving, noticeably, in these areas I've mentioned. In the beginning some of the grammar and speech of the characters wasn't well written but became nearly natural closer to the end, and this is something that will be hard to miss when one plays for themself. Something about the very end of the game was rather strong, though I can't pinpoint what it was as some of the same mistakes could be spotted. I feel that the developers have the potential to do better in the next entry after seeing the end and I hope to see episode 2 in the future to see if my hopes aren't for naught.Ultimately, try not to go in with high expectations like I did. This game is fun and worth the price if you're willing to get used to it as I did. It's short length (about 5 hours at my pace) was a bit of a letdown, but not crushingly so. I found myself satisfied with this game and don't regret taking the time out of my day to give it a try."
